"A U.S. gunmaker has cut ties with Taken star Liam Neeson and has urged other manufacturers to do the same after the actor said there were too many guns in America. PARA USA said that they regret the decision to provide firearms for use in Neeson's latest film Taken 3 and add they will no longer be associating their brand with the actor while urging other companies to follow their lead. The gunmaker is cutting ties with the actor after the Irish-born 62-year-old, who is the star of the ultra-violent Taken trilogy, waded into America's gun fraught gun debate last week during a press conference in Dubai for the launch of Taken 3. Scroll down for video . Liam Neeson starring in the latest instalment of the Taken trilogy. where he plays a gun-toting father. A U.S. gunmaker has now cut ties with the actor after he said there were too many guns in America . Mr Neeson waded into America's gun fraught gun debate last week during a press conference in Dubai for the launch of Taken 3 . He told reporters that 'there are just too many f****** guns out there' and added that it was a 'f****** disgrace.' In a statement on their Facebook page, PARA USA confirmed they would be no longer working with Mr Neeson. They said: 'PARA USA regrets its decision to provide firearms for use in the film Taken 3. 'While the film itself is entertaining, comments made by its Irish-born star during press junkets reflect a cultural and factual ignorance that undermines support of the Second Amendment and American liberties. 'We will no longer provide firearms for use in films starring Liam Neeson and ask that our friends and partners in Hollywood refrain from associating our brand and products with his projects. 'Further, we encourage our partners and friends in the firearms industry to do the same.' Action hero: Liam Neeson starred in a 2010 remake of the 1980s classic Saturday serial The A Team - where he played the commander of a framed special forces ops team . Neeson was quick to draw a line between guns in movies, and real life saying 'it's fantasy' and says movies like Taken 3 don't inspire people to buy guns . Taken again: In the sequel to Taken, called Taken 2, Liam Neeson used his particular set of skills to rescue his wife and shoot a lot of bad guys again . Their statement comes after Mr Neeson, who is reported to have been paid $20million for the latest instalment of Taken, spoke out last week about guns in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Her said: 'There's just too many f****** guns out there. Especially in America. I think the population is like, 320 million? There's over 300 million guns. Privately owned, in America. 'I think it's a f****** disgrace. Every week now we're picking up a newspaper and seeing, yet another few kids have been killed in schools.' When asked if the issue extends to police responsibility Mr Neeson said 'let's not get into it'. But then added: 'Let's put it this way: I think a light has been shone on the justice system in America, and it's a justifiable light.' Mr Neeson, a supporter of gun control, is best known as gun-toting father, Bryan Mills, who will stop at nothing to get his loved ones back. But he was quick to make the distinction between fiction and reality, and said his movies wouldn't inspire people to buy and use guns and argued that growing up watching cowboy movies had not turned him into a killer. Runaway success: Liam Neeson has starred in three Taken movies since the release of the first film in the franchise in 2008 and each of the posters for the movies showed the actor sporting a gun . Biggest hit to date in the series: The latest Taken movie has grossed almost $40 million in its opening weekend and deposed the last Hobbit movie from the number 1 spot in the US box office . He explained: 'A character like Bryan Mills going out with guns and taking revenge: it's fantasy. It's in the movies, you know? I think it can give people a great release from stresses in life and all the rest of it, you know what I mean? It doesn't mean they're all going to go out and go, 'Yeah, let's get a gun!' The Irish-born actor became an American citizen five years ago and currently lives in New York City. Before speaking out about gun ownership in America, Neeson reflected on Said and Cherif Kouachi's shooting spree earlier this month that claimed a dozen lives. He said: 'First off, my thoughts and prayers and my heart are with the deceased, and certainly with all of France. I've got a lot of dear friends in Paris.' The wildly successful Taken trilogy has grossed almost $603 million to date in box office worldwide. It has turned Mr Neeson from a respected character actor most famous for his portrayal of Oscar Schindler in Steven Spielberg's Oscar winning Schindler's List into a fully fledged action hero. The star is reported to have been paid $20 million for his role as CIA operative Bryan Mills, joining the ranks of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks as Hollywood's best paid stars. Since 2005, Liam Neeson has launched a lucrative second career as an action hero. Change of career: No more historical dramas for 60 something action hero Liam Neeson . In a little under a decade, the Irish-born actor has starred in 10 action films, having previously starred in character-driven roles. But from the box-office takings, it is clear that Neeson's career switch has paid-off, and handsomely. Twleve of Neeson's 15 highest-grossing movies in the United States are action films and of those dozen, only three were released before 2005. Indeed, studio bosses have been keen to utilize the actors bankability through his new-found action hero status. In the United States, the average profit per Neeson action movie is $181 million, while his non-action offerings rake in $4 million. That puts him up with stars such as Tom Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio, who make anywhere between $100 million and $300 million per film. And of course, this new found stardom has boosted Neeson's net worth. He was reportedly paid $1 million for Taken, $15 million for Taken 2 and $20 million for Taken 3 - seeing his bank balance shoot up to $75 million.

"William Vogt, 56, of New Hampton, New York, allegedly posed as a millionaire and dubbed himself ‘Bill Bolland’  to scam an investor out of $350,000 . A New York man has been charged with posing as an internationally renowned fashion mogul to con an investor out of $350,000 (£230,000). Using the alias 'Bill Bolland', 56-year-old William Vogt pretended to be a millionaire with the company Bill Bolland Haute Couture, according to the Times Record-Harold. Vogt, of New Hampton, New York, used the company to convince his victim to invest in ventures that did not exist from 2011 to 2014, the New York Attorney General’s office said on Tuesday. He promised the victim he would use the money to secure office space at the Heron Tower in Manhattan, attain seats on the board of directors of Voss Foundation and make political donations to Hillary Clinton, prosecutors alleged. Vogt also told the investor he would buy health insurance and a retirement account, and obtain Swiss citizenship, the court heard. The investor’s money was instead used to pay for rent and purchases via Paypal and to shop at Home Depot, Target and ShopRite, according to the Attorney General's office. It also claimed Vogt created fictional emails from companies including Credit Suisse, Voss Foundation and Morgan Stanley to make his investments appear valid. Authorities believe Vogt scammed several investors but he has only been charged for swindling the one victim, the Times Record-Herald said. He pleaded not guilty at the New York County Supreme Court in Manhattan on Tuesday, according the New York Post. He has been charged with two counts of second-degree grand larceny, four counts of third-degree grand larceny, nine counts of second-degree forgery and three counts of violating the Martin Act. If convicted of the 18 felonies, he could face up to 15 years in prison. Vogt was already in custody at the Ulster County Correctional facility for a parole violation when he was indicted on Tuesday. He is being held on a $4million bond or $2million cash bail. In 1995 he had a run-in with the law when he was arrested and accused of posing as a designer named William ‘St Angelo’ Persico, the Times Record-Herald said, citing a 1995 article from the Register Harold. He told people he wanted to build the largest perfume factory in the northeast. Police said that at the time he went by the aliases Georgio Di St Angelo, Paul Bennett and Bill Bollen. The New York Attorney General’s Office is investigating other high-end investment deals Vogt may have been a part of. The trial is ongoing. Vogt pleaded not guilty to 18 felonies at the New York County Supreme Court in Manhattan on Tuesday .","William Vogt, 56, posed as a millionaire and called himself 'Bill Bolland'

"Europe was last night poised to start printing billions of euros in a desperate bid to prop up the region’s moribund economy. The European Central Bank is today expected to announce a programme of so-called quantitative easing as it steps up its fight against deflation and stagnation. The bank is set to provide £40billion of newly-created cash every month for up to two years – potentially a total of almost £1trillion. Europe was last night poised to start printing billions of euros in a desperate bid to prop up the region’s moribund economy; the European Central Bank is today expected to announce a programme of so-called quantitative easing as it steps up its fight against deflation and stagnation . The policy – which involves the ECB buying up government bonds across the 19 nations of the eurozone – is intended to lessen the pressure on banks and encourage them to lend more money. It is hoped this will help households and businesses by making loans and mortgages cheaper. But critics of the policy say the banking system in Europe is so fragile that even with the huge injection of cash, banks will not feel secure enough to lend any more money. They also fear that it will let irresponsible governments off the hook too easily – and could discourage them from taking the tough decisions needed to tackle the root of the problem. The move, by ECB president Mario Draghi, will be closely watched in Britain as the eurozone is the UK’s largest trading partner. Just as the collapse of the single currency bloc could wreak havoc in the UK, a stronger and more prosperous neighbour could boost confidence on this side of the Channel and help exports. George Osborne has warned that the UK is not ‘immune’ to the problems in the eurozone. But critics fear the ECB’s plan is too little too late, and say it could tempt governments in the single currency bloc to renege on the reforms needed to boost growth and employment in the long-term. Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC, said: ‘If quantitative easing is successful and creates confidence then that is a good thing. The risk is that the political progress on reform gets put on the back burner. Then we get a lack of confidence.’ The move, by ECB president Mario Draghi, pictured, will be closely watched in Britain as the eurozone is the UK’s largest trading partner; just as the collapse of the single currency bloc could wreak havoc in the UK, a stronger and more prosperous neighbour could boost confidence on this side of the Channel and help exports . Axel Weber – chairman of financial services firm UBS and former head of Germany’s central bank, the Bundesbank – said the ECB can only ‘buy time’ for the eurozone. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he said that governments must take tough decisions to make the region more competitive. He said that without such action ‘there will always be questions about the viability’ of the single currency. It is a crucial week for the eurozone, with today’s landmark decision by the ECB to be followed on Sunday by elections in Greece that could see the radical Left-wing Syriza party seize power. It is feared that Syriza’s attempts to renegotiate Greece’s bailout and tone down austerity will see the country leave the euro altogether – plunging the single currency bloc back into crisis. Axel Weber – chairman of financial services firm UBS and former head of Germany’s central bank, the Bundesbank – said the European Central Bank can only ‘buy time’ for the eurozone . Mr Draghi is expected to outline his plans to save the euro in Frankfurt today, following months of discussions amid stiff opposition to money-printing from Germany. But, with prices across the eurozone falling 0.2 per cent in December, stoking fears of a prolonged period of deflation, Mr Draghi looks to have garnered enough support to act. A prolonged period of deflation – such as suffered in Japan – can cripple economies as it makes debts harder to repay and can lead to businesses and households holding off spending. This then has a kock-on effect, hitting corporate profits, wages and jobs. Mr Weber said the ECB risked making a mistake. ‘If the ECB continues to buy time and the time is not used then you have to ask whether doing more of the same is the right policy,’ he said. ‘Europe needs to continue to work at integration. ‘If that does not happen, the single currency area becomes an increasingly difficult project to run.’ He added: ‘However much [time] Mario Draghi decides to buy I don’t think you will see inflation for years.’","European Central Bank is to supply £40b every month for two years .

"One month after his release from a Cuban prison, Alan Gross received a chamber-wide standing ovation during Tuesday’s State of the Union address. The aid worker had spent the past five years languishing in a Cuban prison before being freed by President Raul Castro in a prisoner exchange just before Christmas. When he arrived back on American soil last month, Gross was 100 pounds lighter and missing several of his teeth. Scroll down for video . Alan Gross, recently released from prison in Cuba, thrusts his fist in the air as he is mentioned by President Barack Obama during his State of the Union address on Tuesday . On Tuesday night Gross still looked gaunt and was still minus most of his front teeth as he took pride of place as a guest of First Lady Michelle Obama . On Tuesday night Gross still looked gaunt and was still minus most of his front teeth as he took pride of place as a guest of First Lady Michelle Obama. Gross still broke out into a big smile and waved both fists triumphantly from the visitors' gallery when President Obama welcomed him home. ‘After years in prison, we’re overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs. Welcome home, Alan.’ Gross was joined by wife Judy and earlier the pair had posed for a selfie in front of the Twitter Mirror installed at the White House especially for the event. When president Obama spoke about Cuba during his address he said the previous policy was 'long past its expiration date.' 'When what you’re doing doesn’t work for fifty years, it’s time to try something new,' he said. Alan Gross points back at U.S. President Barack Obama after being recognized during the State of the Union speech. Also pictured are Judy Gross and NASA astronaut Scott Kelly . 'Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.' Gross, 65, had been returned to the U.S. after being freed by President Raul Castro in a reported prisoner exchange that officials said heralds a policy overhaul toward the isolated communist country. 'What a blessing it is to be a citizen of this country!' Gross had said when he returned to the U.S. on December 17 . Appearing in decent health and walking without support, Gross had been accompanied by his wife of 45 years, Judy, as he spoke to reporters at a Washington law office shortly after flying home from Cuba.

He said he has learned the lesson during five years in Cuban captivity that freedom is not free. The former prisoner said he hoped that the U.S. and Cuba can now build new relations. 'Two wrongs never make a right,' Gross said. 'I truly hope that we can now get beyond these mutually belligerent policies. In another breakthrough, Obama revealed that he may very well visit the Caribbean nation--a first for a sitting president since Calvin Coolidge in 1928. 'I don’t have any current plans, but let's see how things evolve,' he told ABC News. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest went a step further, saying, 'I certainly wouldn't rule out a presidential visit.' Despite his ordeal - he has lost 100lb, vision in his right eye and many of his teeth - Mr Gross said he has utmost respect and fondness for Cuba's people and said he was pained 'to see them treated so unjustly'. 'In no way are they responsible for the ordeal to which my family and I have been subjected,' Gross said, describing the vast majority of Cubans as 'incredibly kind, generous and talented'. Gross said knowing he wasn't forgotten by people in the U.S. 'was crucial to my survival'. The father of two daughters, Mr Gross lived in the affluent Washington suburb of Potomac, Maryland, before his capture.

Gross was a longtime supporter of Jewish causes and a career development consultant who traveled the world on private contracts before taking his Cuba assignment. He had only once previously visited Cuba and spoke very limited Spanish. Gross worked for Maryland-based Development Alternatives Inc (DAI), which had a $6 million deal with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to promote democracy and support political dissidents. Gross signed two contracts with DAI paying him a total of $590,000 to deliver telecommunications equipment over 20 months. During five trips to Cuba in 2009, Gross imported banned satellite communications devices and other high-tech gear in his luggage and helped install it at Jewish centers in Havana, Santiago and Camaguey. Cuban officials arrested him in his hotel room on Dec. 3, 2009, just before he had planned to return home. Gross sued DAI and the U.S. government for $60 million, saying he was inadequately informed of the dangers and illegality of his mission. He settled with DAI for an undisclosed sum and a judge threw out his suit against the United States, a decision upheld on appeal. While incarcerated, Gross morphed from a gadget geek to an embittered critic of the U.S. and Cuban governments. He lost 100 pounds from his original 254 pounds. His spirits dimmed after his mother died of cancer in June, and he stopped seeing doctors, his wife, or officials of the U.S. interests section shortly thereafter.

"The family of the businesswoman behind Stagecoach were terrorised in their own home during a raid by masked robbers. Sarah Gloag - the daughter of multi-millionaire Ann Gloag - and Sarah's husband and two children were bound and gagged during the ordeal at their home outside Perth, Scotland. Robbers made off with around half a million pounds worth of valuables, jewellery and cash after threatening the family with meat cleavers, it emerged today. Sarah Gloag (pictured, right, in 2002) - the daughter of Stagecoach businesswoman Ann Gloag (left) - and her family were bound and gagged by raiders during a robbery at their home in Perthshire . The raid happened when Sarah Gloag, 39, her husband Sundeep Salins and their three children were at their home, which is not far from Ann Gloag's Kinfauns Castle. Two raiders wearing masks burst in and tied the hands, feet and mouths of the parents and youngest two children with tape. Friends of the family told the Daily Record the two men 'threatened to kill them' if they tried to escape or raise the alarm. A friend said: 'This was a horrible, vicious attack that has left the family deeply traumatised.' Luckily, the eldest son was playing computer games at the time and wasn't seen by the gang. He later freed his parents and siblings. A spokesman for Ann Gloag said: 'This was an horrific ordeal for the family members involved. 'Everyone is relieved the suspects have been apprehended and the family is co-operating fully with the police and assisting them in every way possible. 'Understandably, this has been a very difficult time for the whole family and we ask that their privacy is respected at this time.' The terrifying robbery took place when two men arrived at the family home near Perth on Monday evening . Police Scotland have said two men are expected to appear in court tomorrow in connection with the incident. A police spokesman said: 'Police Scotland can confirm that two men aged 40 and 57 years old have been arrested in connection with a robbery in Crieff on Sunday and a robbery in the Perthshire area on Monday. 'A report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal and they are expected to appear at Perth Sheriff Court on Thursday.' Businesswoman Ann Gloag, 72, was listed Number 28 in the Sunday Times Rich List and is Scotland's second richest woman after author JK Rowling. Ann and her brother, Sir Brian Souter, started the Stagecoach Group in 1980. The family's home is not far from Ann Gloag's Kinfauns Castle (pictured) outside of the Scottish city . Ann Gloag, a trained nurse, has previously told how she amassed her wealth by 'fighting for survival'. Before her business career, she worked as a unit sister in Bridge of Earn Hospital, Perthshire, where she met her future husband, Robin Gloag, while he was a patient. By the 1970s, the couple were running a small caravan sales business. But, after 20 years in nursing, Mrs Gloag branched out. The couple, along with Mrs Gloag's brother Brian Soutar, now chairman Stagecoach, bought a bus for £425. Their intention was to take the trip of a lifetime to China but the plan failed through visa problems. Businesswoman Mrs Gloag, pictured in 1990 on one the buses which made her family their millions . Instead, the entrepreneurs were invited by a construction company to provide transport for workers travelling to building sites. The brother and sister realised the potential and with their savings and their father's timely redundancy payment of £25,000, they bought two more buses. Stagecoach expanded from its limited Perthshire routes to offering cheap tickets between Dundee and London. The venture took off and Stagecoach Group is now an international company operating buses, trains, trams and ferries. Mrs Gloag serves as a non- executive director. Her former husband was killed in a car crash in December 2007. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Masked men burst into the family home near Perth on Monday night .

"A wedding photographer says she is furious after Ukip activists accidentally printed her mobile number on a giant billboard, leading to her receiving a number of abusive phone calls. Alexandria Hall, 30, said she had been sworn at and dubbed a racist after her telephone number was displayed on the mobile advertising hoarding as it drove around Surrey. Ukip have blamed a 'printing error' for the mix up, which saw Ms Hall's contact details used on the poster proclaiming 'Vote Ukip - let's get our country back', and criticising the Conservatives for not fixing potholes in the county. Wedding photographer Alexandria Hall says she is furious after Ukip activists accidentally printed her mobile number on this giant mobile billboard, leading to her receiving a number of abusive phone calls . Ms Hall, from Walthamstow, east London, said she had been harassed with the calls since Saturday, and had thought at first that it was a joke - until she started receiving abuse over the phone. 'At first I thought it was a joke,' she said. 'But then people started phoning calling me a racist and swearing at me for no reason. 'Now every time the phone rings I get anxious because it's not nice being harassed by people being so aggressive.' Ms Hall said she was sworn at and called a racist by angry callers who rang her by mistake . She only realised what had happened when a local councillor called her to discuss potholes, and later found photographs of the billboard - complete with her phone number - were being circulated on Twitter. Ms Hall said when she spoke to an officer from the party, she was given an apology and told the error was down to a mistake by the printing company. 'Then the Ukip officer suggested that I could forward the callers on to the correct number as if I was some sort of admin service,' she said. She says the mix-up may mean she has to change her phone number, and with it the marketing material for her photography business. 'I told him this is seriously detrimental to my business as a photography as this is my work phone and I've spent loads of money marketing it,' she said. A Ukip spokesman told MailOnline that Ms Hall's number had been displayed on the billboard after a 'printing error', and that she had accepted the party's apology. 'It was a printing error,' he said. 'I do know someone responsible phoned her up as soon as there was a mistake and apologised profusely. Everyone is human and these things happen. 'It was only up for 24 hours over the weekend and it has gone down now.' He added: 'We are embarrassed by the situation and sorry for the inconvenience.'

"A secret file on ‘unnatural’ sexual behaviour at Westminster that was given to Margaret Thatcher has been discovered. The document contains allegations ‘of unnatural sexual proclivities’ against high-profile figures, and was prepared for the then Prime Minister in the 1980s. Last night campaigning MP John Mann suggested it may form part of a cover-up over a VIP paedophile ring operating at the time. Scroll down for video . Top secret: An academic has unearthed this classified file about 'unnatural sexual' behaviour at the heart of Westminster but the Government will not release the document . Mrs Thatcher's press secretary Sir Bernard Ingham, (left) pictured with the former Prime MInister, said  he 'could not recall the file' but confirmed they both knew about sex crime allegations aimed at a minister . He said there was a secret Downing Street meeting over the file in 1982 and its potentially explosive contents were thought to be so damaging that the Cabinet Office decided as recently as a few years ago that it should remain classified. The paper was only discovered by chance by an academic while he was researching secret Thatcher files at the National Archives in Kew, South West London. Child abuse campaigners have reacted with fury after it emerged the file was not handed over to an NSPCC review into government documents on child abuse. Last night the Cabinet Office promised to reveal it to the Government’s child abuse inquiry, suggesting its contents are highly relevant. But campaigners said it should be made public and shown to the police to prevent any alleged abusers escaping justice. The file was found by Dr Chris Murphy, a security and intelligence lecturer at the University of Salford, who was trawling though catalogue records at the National Archives for security documents. The contents of the document remain secret, with only the title of the mystery file publicly listed as: ‘PREM19/588 - SECURITY. Allegations against former public [word missing] of unnatural sexual proclivities; security aspects 1980 Oct 27 - 1981 Mar 20.’ According to Dr Murphy, it was found among hundreds of so-called ‘Prem’ files – security documents that passed through the prime minister’s office. Research: Dr Chris Murphy from the University of Salford found the new classified file and believes that because of its title Margaret Thatcher will have seen it . He said: ‘I do not know what are the contents of this document, but the fact that the file is headed security and went to the Prime Minister’s office is suggestive of the fact that we are talking about someone’s sexual behaviour becoming a matter of national security.’ Despite the seeming importance of the document, NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless who led last year’s review into how the Home Office handled child abuse allegations between 1979 and 1999, said nobody showed it to him. He told Sky News: ‘If there is pertinent material in this file it should be submitted to the sexual abuse inquiry as well as the relevant police force so they can conduct a criminal investigation if necessary.’ Last night Mr Mann said: ‘The question must be how many more files relate to prominent people, MPs, politicians in relation to child abuse and why have they not been made available to Peter Wanless or the Metropolitan Police?’ National security: The paperwork, listed by the National Archive in Kew, pictured, has been classified for for 35 years on grounds of national security and is still in the hands of the Cabinet Office . Yesterday Mrs Thatcher’s former press secretary, Sir Bernard Ingham, told Sky News he could not recall the file, although he said Lady Thatcher was aware of allegations against a government minister in the early 1980s. She has previously been linked to the historic child abuse scandal after her former aide Sir Peter Morrison was accused of raping an underage boy. A former bodyguard to Lady Thatcher said he warned her of rumours about her private parliamentary secretary, but he was still appointed Tory deputy party chairman. Sir Peter died in 1995 aged 51 and was never charged with any offence. Secret life: Sir Peter Hayman had a double identity and used to rent a flat to keep child pornography - but was only given a police caution . Diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, a decorated diplomat who lived a secret life as a paedophile, was named by MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1981 using Parliamentary privilege. The new document, revealed today by Sky News, was written about the same period. Hayman was member ‘330’ of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which supported and encouraged illegal sexual relationships between adults and children. He rented a flat at 95 Linden Gardens, Notting Hill Gate, London under the name of Peter Henderson to store PIE literature and graphic correspondence with fellow paedophiles. But Sir Peter made a mistake and left a packet of paedophile material in an envelope on a London bus. It was addressed to Mr Henderson at Linden Gardens in Notting Hill.Soon afterwards, in November 1978, police raided the Linden Gardens flat. What they found there was a huge trove of paedophilia and other extreme pornography. Among it was a library of 45 substantial diaries in which Sir Peter had recorded in detail his sexual experiences and fantasies, the latter including sex with minors. Even the hardened police of the Obscene Publications Squad were ‘revolted’ by the Linden Gardens haul. He sobbed as he was interviewed and feared he would be exposed and his reputation ruined. And yet he wasn't. Much to the anger and disbelief of the Obscene Publications Squad he was only given a caution.  He died in 1992 aged 77. Geoffrey Dickens also said that an unnamed senior civil servant was helping to run a paedophile ring from Whitehall. The MP claimed the man had at least 57 obscene slides of men having sex with children. He said at the time: 'I'm concerned about the cover-up of a senior civil servant who is a paedophile and wants sex with children legalised. He is a security risk'.","Academic found paperwork still classified on national security grounds .

"Kris Jenner is not only giving her daughter Kendall’s new relationship with Dallas Mavericks forward Chandler Parsons two thumbs up… she’s is the one who set them up in the first place! And now the kids are so crazy about each other that Chandler just turned his back on his first big showbiz break just to stay true to the youngest Jenner. Days before he was supposed to show up on set for his starring role in a reality dating show for Relativity Television, Chandler announced that he was opting out. ‘Mama Kris met Chandler a few weeks ago and was blown away by not only his good looks, but his promising B-ball future,’ says a source. Scroll down for video . Model couple: Kendall is following in the footsteps of her sisters by hooking up with NBA player Chandler . Even though he's 25, and her youngest offspring is only 18, she immediately flew into matchmaking mode. Now the kids have fallen head over heels for each other. Kendall was linked with Harry Styles and 5SOS singer Ashton Irwin in recent months. Asked about being spotted with Kendall in Los Angeles by Chelsea Handler on her show last night, the 6'9"" Chandler, known to his friends as Chan, hedged and said they were out but in a group. He also claimed that he didn't have a girlfriend. Asked about the relationship by MailOnline, he had 'no comment'. As MailOnline reported recently, Kendall and her sister Kylie were spotted dinning out at STK LA recently with Parsons and a few pals. But what wasn’t confirmed at the time was that the twosome was already a couple. People reported that they were 'flirting heavily'. And while Kris Jenner is happy she's found a new man for Kendall, she's thrilled she could also be gaining a new sexy cast member on Keeping up with The Kardashians. Parsons just signed a $46m, three-year contract with the Dallas Mavericks. And his handsome looks also landed him a modeling contract with Buffalo Jeans. But not everyone is happy about the new coupling… especially producers of a new reality dating show that was supposed to star Parsons. Momager: Kris Jenner like to have her hand in all aspects of her childrens' lives. She introduced Kendall to Chan, as he is called by his friends . ‘Chandler was just about to start filming a series similar to The Bachelor,’ says the source. ‘He was going to be introduced to a group of gorgeous women in hopes of being fixed up with the girl of his dreams. 'But before the cameras had a chance to roll, he’s pulled out of the show.’ A spokesperson for Relativity TV says that Chandler is not planning to do a reality show of any kind. The source adds that when it came down to the wire, Kendall couldn’t stand the thought of Chandler kissing another girl, even if it might be just for the cameras. So Parsons backed out of the show. ‘Lots of girls are warned off dating athletes by friends,’ says the source. 'But in Parsons' case, it’s his buddies who are warning him against dating a Kardashian! Swoon: Many hearts were afluttering when Chandler posed for this ad for Buffalo jeans . Million dollar man: The basketball star signed a $46 million contract with the Houston Rockets . ‘Everyone knows that when you date a Kardashian… you have to deal with Kris who is totally enmeshed in the lives of her kids,’ says the source. ‘No matter how hot Kendall is, it’s not worth it. 'Let’s face it… one of the Kardashian girls is always romancing a handsome athlete.  You had your Reggie Bush, your Kris Humphries, your Lamar Odem, and now you got the new kid on the roster… Chandler Parsons! ' And while Kris Jenner is over the moon that her game plan to make a couple out of Kendall and Chandler is obviously working, Kendall’s pop, Bruce Jenner, isn’t all that thrilled. ‘On one hand Bruce knows how most professional athletes are major players and he doesn’t want that for his daughter. On the other hand, he doesn’t want to cause trouble since his daughter’s already been through so much this year with her parents' separation. ‘Besides, it would be like trying to close the barn door after the horse is already out.’","Dallas Mavericks b-ball player Chandler Parsons was supposed to star in a show to find his dream girl .

"Angry: Captain Roberto Bosio, who was off-duty but helped co-ordinate the evacuation, said Schettino was a 'disgraceful man' An off-duty captain who co-ordinated the Costa Concordia's evacuation has condemned the ship's skipper as a 'disgraceful' man. Captain Roberto Bosio, 45, this afternoon broke his silence over claims Francesco Schettino abandoned ship before passengers and failed to make a mayday call as the ship listed. He said: 'Only a disgraceful man would have left all those passengers on board. It was the most horrible experience of my life. A tragedy, a heartache that I will carry with me forever.' Off-duty Bosio, who captains the Concordia's sister ship the Serena, was only on board the ship by chance as he made his way back home to Savona, near Genoa. Bosio, who is engaged and lives in Ventimiglia on the French-Italian border, was in his cabin resting when disaster struck. He helped dozens of woman and children into lifeboats, and is understood to have organised the entire rescue effort throughout the night. Survivors have also said that as the keen biker left his cabin he told every passenger he met to put on a life jacket. He added: 'We managed to avoid the worse and have the world crash down around us. I just want to rest and forget. 'Don’t call me a hero. I just did my duty, the duty of a sea captain – actually the duty of a normal man. 'I and the others with me just did our duty. We looked each other in the eyes for a second and then we just got on with it.' Bosio's comments came after one Schettino's former captains labelled him 'a braggart, a show-off' and claimed he drove the luxury liner 'like a Ferrari'. Captain Mario Palombo also revealed he had to put Francesco Schettino in his place 'more than once' when the under-fire commander acted as his deputy on the now doomed vessel, La Repubblica reported. His claims came as Italian divers again suspended their search of the capsized ship at 8am after it shifted slightly on its resting place near the Tuscan island of Giglio. Fire services spokesman Luca Cari said . the shift of a few centimetres posed a potential threat to diving teams . operating in the submerged spaces of the ship. It increased fears the . vessel could soon dislodge from the rock and plummet 100m down to the . bottom of the Mediterranean. 'Braggart and a show-off': The Costa Concordia's captain Frencesco Schettino, pictured (left) in his pomp in 2010 and leaving court (right) yesterday, has been heavily criticised by a former captain of the stricken luxury cruise liner . Slipping: The Costa Concordia fell another few centimetres into the sea today, sparking fears it will soon dislodge itself from its rocky resting place and plummet 100m to the bottom of the sea . Schettino, 52, a captain since 2006, now faces a possible 15 years in prison for multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship while dozens of passengers were still aboard. Yesterday the death toll rose to 11 when divers located five more bodies, all of them adults wearing life jackets, in the rear of the ship near an emergency evacuation point. A total of 24 people are still missing. Trawling: Police scuba divers scour the ship for survivors and bodies, using explosives to blast debris and other obstacles out of their path . Race against the clock: The hulking vessel could slip and plunge to the sea bed at any minute . The tongue lashing given to Schettino by an angry coastguard has been turned into a £12 T-shirt. The shirt, bearing the phrase 'Vada a Bordo, Cazzo' - went on sale within minutes of the recording of the coastguard's row with captain Francesco Schettino was made public. Widely read as 'Get on board, damn it',  Italian translators say the phrase is really far more forceful than that. One said: 'In one way it can mean 'F***ing get on board' and in another way it means 'Get on board, you p***k'.' Prosecutors have alleged Schettino was trying to show off by sailing past the Tuscan island of Giglio, where his head waiter lived, when he ran the ship aground just 150m offshore. The ship should have been at least five miles out to sea, but struck rocks Schettino claimed were 'not on his chart'.The liner then continued for several hundred metres before running aground further along the coast. Schettino, who started his career on a ferry boat near his home on Italy's Amalfi coast but has now been stripped of his command, has now been ordered by an investigating magistrate to undergo a drug test. Searching off the liner was due to continue today, before its suspension, with further explosive charges detonated around the superstructure. The aim is to make it easier for navy and coastguard diving teams to reach sections of the Concordia that still need to be searched. Attention was due to be focused mainly on the restaurant on deck four at the back of the Concordia. That . was the location where the bodies of four men and a woman all aged . between 50 and 60 years old were found yesterday, and where it is feared . the rest of the missing passengers and crew are. The search teams are racing against time . as the weather is set to turn stormy tomorrow, with waves of up to two . metres forecast as well as storm force winds. Brave team: The divers are working under the danger that furniture or debris could slip and crush them if the boat lists . Human chain: Rescue workers climb on to the Concordia in the faint hope that some passengers may be clinging to life in a freak air pocket . The fear is that a large sea swell could easily 'lift' the liner from the rock ledge it is resting on and send it plunging 100m to the bottom of the sea. Salvage teams are also expected to begin pumping off 2,280 tons of heavy duty diesel that is still in the ship's tanks and which are a ticking ecological time bomb as the area is a protected sea sanctuary for whales, porpoises and dolphins. Meanwhile captain Roberto Bosio, who was off duty on the Concordia when the disaster struck and who has been hailed as a hero after giving the order to abandon ship, broke his silence and said: 'Only a disgraceful man would have left all those passengers on board.' Captain Bosio, 45, who was seen helping dozens of women and children into lifeboats, added: 'It was the most horrible experience of my life. 'A tragedy, a heartache that I will carry with me forever. We managed to avoid the worse and have the world crash down around us. I just want to rest and forget. Don't call me a hero. I just did my duty, the duty of a sea captain - actually the duty of a normal man. 'I and the others with me just did our duty. We looked each other in the eyes for a second and then we Just got on with it.' Discovery: A scuba diver is pictured dragging a body out from the stricken cruise liner Costa Concordia as the confirmed death toll rises to 11 .

"Text that was hidden on a damaged copy of the 1215 Magna Carta for more than 250 years has been uncovered. The near-invisible words were revealed using groundbreaking multispectral imaging work at the British Library in London. This work has been completed by library's conservators and scientists in preparation for next year’s 800th anniversary of the sealing of the ancient charter. Scroll down for video . Hidden text in a copy of the 1215 Magna Carta damaged in a fire has been read for the first time in 250 years. The manuscript appears a sandy colour in natural light (pictured), but the text 'appears' under special light conditions (shown in black and white) The burnt copy of the Magna Carta is one of four original manuscripts from 1215 which survive. The Magna Carta was the first document imposed upon a King of England by a group of his subjects, the feudal barons, in an attempt to limit his powers by law and protect their rights. The scanned copy of the Magna Carta was damaged in the Cotton Library fire in 1731. Staff at the library attempted to preserve it using 19th century techniques, by flattening it out and mounting it, which left some text almost impossible to see, Christina Duffy, an imaging scientist at the British Library explained in a blog post. Now, multispectral imaging of the burnt copy – a non-destructive imaging technique -  has been conducted and has revealed text that has not been visible for 250 years. A British Library curator told MailOnline that some of the words of the Magna Carta's 'security clause' can be seen using the UV image. Once the charters were removed from the frames, near-infrared spectroscopy and high-resolution digital microscopy was used to investigate the condition of the ink and parchment. Multispectral imaging was used to 'virtually peel away the layers of damage' and reveal obscured words using a high resolution camera and different wavelengths of light. The variations in the chemical composition of the material in the charter was varied and included ink and parchment which reacts differently to the lights. This means that experts could see extra information – including text – which is undetectable by the human eye. An English translation reads: 'Since we have granted all these things for God, for the better ordering of our kingdom, and to allay the discord that has arisen between us and our barons, and since we desire that they shall be enjoyed in their entirety, with lasting strength, for ever, we give and grant to the barons the following security: The barons shall elect twenty-five of their number to keep, and cause to be observed with all their might, the peace and liberties granted and confirmed to them by this charter. 'If we, our chief justice, our officials or any of our servants offend in any respect against any man, or transgress any of the articles of the peace or of this security, and the offence is made known to four of the twenty-five barons, they shall come to us ... to declare it and claim immediate redress ... The twenty-five barons shall swear to obey all the above articles faithfully, and shall cause them to be obeyed by others to the best of their power.' The clause is so important because it was the only means by which Magna Carta was to be enforced. If King John was judged to have transgressed its terms, an elected committee of twenty-five barons were given authority to seek redress from him. An English translation reads: 'Since we have granted all these things for God, for the better ordering of our kingdom, and to allay the discord that has arisen between us and our barons, and since we desire that they shall be enjoyed in their entirety, with lasting strength, for ever, we give and grant to the barons the following security: The barons shall elect twenty-five of their number to keep, and cause to be observed with all their might, the peace and liberties granted and confirmed to them by this charter.

The twenty-five barons shall swear to obey all the above articles faithfully, and shall cause them to be obeyed by others to the best of their power.' The ‘burnt’ Magna Carta (pictrured) was damaged in the Cotton Library fore in 1731 and staff at the library attempted to preserve it using 19th century techniques, by flattening it out and mounting it, which left some text almost impossible to see . Multispectral imaging (pictured left) – a non-destructive imaging technique - of the burnt copy has been conducted and has revealed text that has not been visible for 250 years. An image of the historical manuscript can be seen, right, under cyan lighting conditions . The scanned copy of the Magna Carta was damaged in the Cotton Library fire in 1731. The contents of the Cotton Library was assembled by Robert Cotton and presented to the British nation by his grandson in 1700. It contains some of the most well-known treasures of the British Library, including the Lindisfarne Gospels, Magna Carta and Beowulf. On October 23, 1731, a fire broke out where the manuscripts were being temporarily held, at Ashburnham House, Westminster. A quarter of the collection was affected and the librarian is said to have leapt from a window to escape the blaze, rescuing an early manuscript of the Bible at the same time. A total of 13 manuscripts were completely destroyed and many only survived as charred fragments, or with significant damage. Lots of the parchments were coated in gelatine, which is the end product of sudden degradation of the parchment collagen. When cooled, it becomes brittle and obscures text. Water used to extinguish the fire, also played a role in damaging the literary treasures. The content of the hidden text isn't new, because the four manuscripts have the same content, but the discovery is important nonetheless. To clarify the contents of the damaged parchment, a team of experts first examined the original frames to determine their structure and composition. All original mounting materials in contact with the charters were tested using different methods, such as infrared spectroscopy and pH tests, to determine their stability and compatibility with the new materials. Once the charters were removed from the frames, near-infrared spectroscopy and high-resolution digital microscopy was used to investigate the condition of the ink and parchment to assess the overall condition of the historical document. ‘With the frames and glass removed, there was a rare opportunity to employ the cutting-edge technique of multispectral imaging enabling us to virtually peel away the layers of damage currently affecting the manuscript,’ Dr Duffy wrote. Multispectral imaging is a non-destructive, non-invasive imaging technique using different colour lights, including ultra-violet and infrared, to recover faded and lost text. Multispectral imaging is a non-destructive, non-invasive imaging technique using different colour lights, including ultra-violet and infrared, to recover faded and lost text. This is the result when used on the manuscript. Text invisible to the human eye can be seen and analysed by experts . In February 2015, the four copies of the Magna Carta will be brought together for the first time in history for a three-day event, which will allow further academic study of them side by side. An easily legible copy usually housed at Salisbury Cathedral is shown . Uncovering the text was a painstaking process. Temporary housing was prepared to store the charter (top left) and the original wooden frames carefully removed to get access to the manuscript (top right). The charter was removed from the mounting (bottom left) and then underwent tests to determine its condition (bottom right) A high-resolution camera was securely mounted directly over the charter, which was then illuminated with LED lights ranging from the ultraviolet at wavelengths invisible to humans, to the visible. The chemical composition of the material in the charter was varied and included ink and parchment which reacts differently to the lights. This means that experts could see extra information – including text – which is undetectable by the human eye. This technique will allow scientists to preserve the Magna Carta for the next 800 years. In February 2015, the four manuscripts will be brought together for the first time in history for a three-day event, which will allow further academic study of them side by side. The date is 800 years after the issue of the Charter by King John in 1215. A total of 1,215 members of the public will also be able to see them. People interested in the historic opportunity can enter a ballot to be in with a chance of taking part in the event, sponsored by law firm Linklaters. The British Library is home to two of the original Magna Carta manuscripts, while the other two are held at Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals. Claire Breay, Lead Curator of Medieval and Earlier Manuscripts at the British Library, says: 'Magna Carta is the most popular item in the Library’s Treasures gallery, and is venerated around the world as marking the starting point for government under the law. 'Bringing the four surviving manuscripts together for the first time will create a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for researchers and members of the public to see them in one place.'

"Most of us would tremble when faced with a venomous spider or a dangerously high cliff edge. But one woman has a rare disease meaning she is biologically unable to feel fear. The U.S. woman, known to doctors as SM, has been put into life-threatening situations but remains completely unfazed. She didn’t panic at being held at gunpoint and knifepoint – and didn’t even call the police after  these attacks. She was also nearly beaten to death by her first husband, but never felt scared. A U.S. woman known to doctors as SM is biologically unable to feel the emotion fear, due to a genetic condition which has caused the part of her brain responsible for being scared to waste away . When faced with snakes that could be poisonous to her, she is so curious  she has to be restrained from touching them. While doctors have been studying SM for more than a decade, she has never been interviewed before. This is because the team of neuroscientists, from the University of Iowa, looking into her condition, said if her identity was made public people could easily take advantage of her. So  Dr Daniel Tranel, of the University of Iowa, carried out the interview and passed it on to journalists at NPR radio station, to be used in their Invisibilia podcast. Dr Tranel began by asking SM, a 44-year-old mother of three, to describe what fear is. ‘Well, that’s what I’m trying to – to be honest, I truly have no clue’ she replied. She said she does remember being scared of a catfish her father had caught when she was a young girl, as she didn’t want it to bite her, but that was the only time she can remember experiencing the emotion. And not being scared has led to some hair-raising situations. Urbach–Wiethe disease is a rare genetic disorder. Scientists have only identified 400 cases since it's discovery. The symptoms of the disease vary greatly from individual to individual. They could include a hoarse voice, bumps around the eyes, easily damaged skin with wounds that don't heal easily. Other symptoms include  dry, wrinkly skin, and  a general thickening of the skin and mucous membranes. In some cases there is also a hardening of brain tissue in which can lead to epilepsy and other abnormalities, such as a lack of fear, in SM's case. The disease is typically not life-threatening and patients do not show a decreased life span. When her sons were small she was walking to the shop when a man on a park bench called her over. She said: ‘He grabbed me by the shirt, and he held a knife to my throat and told me he was going to cut me. 'I told him - I said: “go ahead and cut me”. And I said, “I'll be coming back, and I'll hunt your ass”. The man let her go, and she went home, but she didn’t call the police after this event, as she didn’t see the danger. SM has a rare genetic condition called Urbach-Wiethe disease, which causes parts of her brain to harden and waste away, NPR reports. Urbach-Wiethe disease has three main symptoms: people with the condition have a hoarse voice, small bumps around their eyes and calcium deposits in the brain. These deposits cause parts of the brain to calcify and harden, which can lead to epilepsy or other abnormalities. In SM’s case, almond-like structures called amygdala found deep in the brain have calcified and wasted away. The amygdalae are crucial to the human fear response, and so SM is now literally unable to feel the emotion fear. Normally, in situations that might cause danger, the amygdalae would send signals to the body that would induce symptoms of fear: the heart to start racing and the palms to sweat. SM has Urbach-Wiethe disease, which causes calcium deposits to form in her brain. Deposits have formed in her brain's amygdalae (one of which is pictured in red), which are responsible for the fear response . But for SM, as this bit of her brain doesn’t exist, she doesn’t experience these symptoms in situations others would find scary. She is also unable to recognise a fearful facial expression on another person. Doctors note this is an isolated defect: she has normal intelligence and feels other emotions such as joy, sadness, anger in the same way as others. Scientists have identified only about 400 people worldwide with Urbach-Wiethe disease. University of Iowa scientists were able to induce fear in her in 2013, when they made her inhale carbon dioxide. Even at low concentrations, if the amygdala detects carbon dioxide in the body, it normally triggers fear and panic as it is a sign of possible suffocation. Scientists predicted that SM wouldn’t panic after inhaling the gas, but in fact, she did. Professor Antonio Damasio, a neuroscientist at the University of Iowa who has been studying SM, says what is remarkable about her is that her lack of fear means she has no traumatic memories. When faced with poisonous snakes that would make most people shiver with fright, SM is so curious she has to be held back from touching them. She has also been held at knifepoint, at gunpoint and nearly been beaten to death. Her genetic condition meant she didn't feel scared in these situations and has no bad memories . If bad events happen in SM’s life, they are not registered as bad or threatening, and she doesn’t experience them as such, he said. Even if her husband almost beat her to death, the memory is not traumatic, and leaves no 'emotional footprint' which could cause psychological problems for others. ‘If you have no fear, more terrible things will happen to you, but you don't personally experience them as terrible,’ Professor Damasio told NPR journalists. ‘If you have a lot of fear, fewer bad things are likely to happen, but it's very probable that your life is more painful to you. So is it better to be fearful or fearless?’ Scientists are now looking into whether SM’s case could help others with traumatic memories, such as soldiers with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, according to LiveScience. Finding treatments that could dampen down the activity of the amygdala could help people with PTSD, researchers believe.","Woman, known as SM, has been studied by neuroscientists for 15 years .

"A young woman with eczema so severe it looked as though she was suffering painful sunburn finally has a clear complexion, thanks to a'magical' organic treatment. Elena Haydon,  from Bristol, was left horrified when she woke up one day to find her face was covered in large red blotches. The itchy red rash covered the 21-year-old's whole face, resembling severe burns and leaving her in agony. For years Miss Haydon tried countless antibiotics, steroid creams and other well-known treatments - but to no avail. But when her aunt suggested an organic cream, Miss Haydon felt she had nothing to lose. And today the 21-year-old photography graduate has the perfect complexion she has so desperately longed for. Scroll down for video . Elena Haydon, 21, suffered severe eczema as a result of the stress of her A-level exams (pictured left). After years of trying different treatments, she finally found an organic cream that cleared her skin (pictured right) Miss Haydon's eczema was so bad it looked as though she was sunburnt, and she was unable to wear make-up as it caused her skin to flare up. Now her skin is clear (pictured) she says she 'has her life back' She said: 'Waking up one morning to discover I looked like I'd been burnt was a teenage girl's worst nightmare. 'I could no longer wear makeup because it was too painful and it would make the eczema flare up. 'My sore face started to take up my whole life, I found myself looking down when I spoke to people to try and hide it. 'I no longer felt ""pretty"" and as much as I tried to fit in I never really felt like I did. 'I visited my GP and different specialists more times than I can remember but no antibiotics would work. 'Steroid creams would help for a short time but then they would start to thin my skin. Purepotions has a range called Skin Salvation suitable for eczema sufferers. The products contain beeswax, which manufacturers say works as a natural antibacterial barrier, protecting the skin from external irritants. They also contain hemp, which is rich in essential fatty acids which are lacking in those with dry skin. Manufacturers claim the products replenish dry skin with natural oils and has no known side effects. They contains no parabens, preservatives or perfumes, they added. 'Over three years later I'm now eczema free and no longer feel like people are staring at me. 'I finally have nice skin and have my confidence back.' Doctors said the inflammation was triggered by stress, noting it flared up when she was preparing for her A Levels. The painful red patches of eczema appeared  on Miss Haydon's face, but also spread to her hands and elbows. She said: 'I lost more and more confidence every day, the eczema had a huge effect on my life. 'None of the medication prescribed to me by the doctors helped, I thought it would never go away. 'The eczema would give off a burning sensation as well, leaving my cheeks feeling incredibly warm. 'But the more angry and stressed I got, the worse the eczema became. 'People would stare at my face and ask what was wrong with my skin - I knew it looked so burnt and horrible - it was humiliating.' She says she is lucky to be supported by her boyfriend Tom (pictured left). 'He loves me with or without my sunburnt looking skin,' she says . After her auntie saw an advert for a cream called Purepotions in a magazine, Miss Haydon gave it a try. She found it worked and cleared her skin. 'I can go out now with my head held high with fresh looking skin,' she says. Here, she is pictured (right) with her friend Amelia (left) Luckily Miss Haydon received support from her boyfriend, family and friends who all helped her try to find a treatment. She said: 'I've been with my boyfriend Tom now for six years and he loves me with or without my sunburnt looking skin. 'When my confidence was at its lowest he would always tell me how beautiful I was and picked me straight back up again. 'My mum was so worried about me, she knew how badly it could affect me sometimes, I don't know how I would've got through it all without her.' But it was Miss Haydon's auntie who came to her rescue after reading about a cream - known as Purepotions - in a magazine. After further research and digging Miss Haydon decided to give the organic cream, created by Natalie Balmond, a try. When her eczema was at its worst, Miss Haydon said her mother was worried about her, knowing how it could affect her confidence. Here, she is pictured (right) with mother Mandy (left) after her graduation . Miss Haydon said the Purepotions cream which cleared her skin was 'magical' and 'life changing'. She is pictured here after beating her eczema . Miss Haydon said: 'It was great to find someone who truly knew the pain of suffering from eczema. 'Natalie's daughter suffered from chronic eczema so she created Purepotions which contains natural ingredients and couldn't irritate the most sensitive of skin. 'It was magical - within just a few days my eczema started to clear up and I've never looked back since. 'I finally have my life back, I can go out now with my head held high with fresh looking skin.

"They don’t look like the typical criminal. The vast majority are women. Very few actually attend the court hearings to which they are summoned. Instead, a prosecutor simply races through scores of near-identical cases, repeating a well-rehearsed formula of allegations, pleas and excuses. Often the magistrates fine the perpetrators in just a matter of seconds. The crime? TV licence dodging. Every week, in courts across England and Wales, almost 3,000 people are issued with fines of up to £1,000 for not having a TV licence. Unlike non-payment of a gas or electricity bill, failure to pay the £145.50 annual fee results in a criminal record. The licence fee raises £3.72 billion a year for the BBC. It is illegal to watch or record live television without a licence . With more than 150,000 people convicted a year and courts being clogged (Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has said that 10 per cent of magistrates court cases concern TV licence dodgers), the Government has called for a review of whether non-payment should be classified as a crime. Meanwhile, court staff are being forced to set aside entire days, once a week or every fortnight, to process such cases. And many city magistrates are too busy with more important crimes and are farming out TV licence cases to small regional courts. The licence fee raises £3.72 billion a year for the BBC. It is illegal to watch or record live television using a TV, computer, tablet or even mobile phone if you are an adult under the age of 75 without a licence. While the offence normally results in a fine, it is not punishable by imprisonment. But you can be jailed for non-payment of a fine — with about 50 offenders a year being jailed. The problem has become more pressing in recent years because fewer households have traditional TV sets as more people watch ‘catch-up’ TV on tablets, computers and smartphones. According to Ofcom, the telecommunications watchdog, 300,000 fewer homes had a television at the end of last year, compared to the previous year. BACK in 2011, the BBC gave the business process management firm Capita an eight-year £560 million contract to administer the licence. The company employs 1,400 staff to chase non-payers — many on target-related bonuses. I decided to spend a day at two typical courts — Warwickshire Justice Centre and Wigan Magistrates’ Court — to observe how our justice system is getting bogged down by countless TV licence-dodgers, most of them women. What is remarkable is how few of them attend hearings. Magistrates listen to a representative from TV Licensing (technically a prosecutor) outline each case and then they take advice from a legal advisor. Otherwise, apart from the clerk and a court usher, the room is empty. It is a perfunctory affair. In Wigan, 141 of the 187 convicted were women (75 per cent). Of the 171 Warwickshire cases, 134 were female (78 per cent) (picture posed by models) Usually, non-payers have returned a form registering their guilty plea, adding details of their income and any mitigating circumstances to be considered in their absence. During that one day in Wigan, £35,000 of fines (including costs) were issued to 187 people, only four of whom attended the court. The eldest was a disabled 69-year-old woman fined £195. The youngest was an 18-year-old unemployed woman fined £195 for not having a licence for one week. The biggest fine, of £500, was for a woman convicted of the offence for a third time. Of the four women who turned up, two were near tears as they explained how money-troubles had got on top of them. Four others had sent notes to plead not guilty, which meant that a trial date had to be set — at yet more public expense. In some cases, people who had failed to respond to letters about non-payment were convicted in their absence. In Warwickshire, 171 cases were processed in a similarly methodical way. All had admitted guilt. Again, only four defendants turned up — in the hope of persuading, in person, the magistrates to issue a small fine by saying they were on a low income. In total, around £60,000 in fines, including court costs, were handed down. In Wigan, 141 of the 187 convicted were women (75 per cent). Of the 171 Warwickshire cases, 134 were female (78 per cent). Those figures are reflected nationally. In 2013, a total of 122,686 women were prosecuted and 106,932 convicted. That compared with 55,099 men prosecuted, and 46,024 convicted. This is in stark contrast to other crimes where men make up the vast majority of offenders. This begs the question: why are so many more women being caught without a TV licence than men? The BBC glibly says ‘convictions are a matter for the courts’. And Capita, which takes cases to court on behalf of the BBC, says that when its staff go to the homes of people suspected of not having a licence, they take statements from ‘any responsible adult’ present — regardless of age or gender. So, perhaps, the answer is that women are most likely to be at home when enforcement officers call. However, others think there is another explanation. Michael Shakespeare, from Kent, who challenged the BBC in a test case over the need to pay for a licence, thinks that women are more easily intimidated. He says: ‘A single mother or woman pensioner who is on their own probably won’t stand up to the officers when they knock on the door. They probably don’t know their rights either.’ In his own battle with the BBC, Mr Shakespeare ensured that all his equipment at home could not receive a live TV signal and, instead, he watched catch-up TV through the internet, for which you do not need a TV licence. Half of those jailed for the non-payment of licence fee fines are women, yet only 4 per cent of the country's prison population are female . Even so, he was summoned to court for non-payment of his TV licence. In a landmark case, a judge found he had no case to answer. Andrew Bridgen, a Tory MP who is campaigning to make non-payment of the TV licence a civil offence, also believes that the BBC is ‘unnecessarily criminalising’ women. He says: ‘They will prosecute whoever is at home when they call, and sadly that tends to be women.’ He points to official figures that show that half of all those jailed for non-payment of fines imposed for not having a TV licence, are women, yet only 4 per cent of the prison population are female. The MP says that, in some cases, women who have felt so intimidated by enforcement officers have bought a licence when they don’t even own a TV. The BBC certainly pursues the licence with some vigour. Official figures show that, perhaps, it has done so with a bit too much alacrity. For it has been forced to pay more than £100,000 in compensation to 2,500 people wrongly pursued for not having licences. One man who claims to have been a victim of such techniques is Peter Troy, from County Durham, who complained that licensing staff had been unnecessarily aggressive when demanding he buy a licence for an empty home that had been left to him after his mother had died. He says he almost bought a TV licence ‘in panic’ because he was so worried. ‘I was shaken up by the brazen way they could bully people in their own homes,’ he says. Despite his explanation that no one lived at the property, he said threats of a summons for non- payment continued. He was eventually awarded £250 compensation after saying he would, in turn, sue the BBC for harassment. So, what do magistrates who have to deal with all these cases think? Malcolm Richardson, deputy chairman of the Magistrates’ Association, says that his members say criminal proceedings for failure to pay the TV licence fee is ‘too severe’. ‘It doesn’t serve the interests of justice to lock someone up for not paying. Like non-payment of utility bills, they should be dealt with by the civil law. We would certainly welcome the law being changed.’ John O’Connell, director of Taxpayers’ Alliance, says it is ‘stupid’ that non-payment of a TV licence is a crime. ‘These unnecessary criminal proceedings clutter up the court system and cost taxpayers an extraordinary amount. Of course everybody should obey the law, but the punishment is totally disproportionate to the offence. As new technologies change the way we watch television, the TV licence in its current state is unsustainable in the long term.’ Even a TV licensing spokesperson says the organisation would ‘prefer not to prosecute’ and that the licence is ‘good value at 40p a day’. He adds: ‘We know some struggle financially, which is why we offer a range of payments methods, including small weekly cash instalments and why we work with more than 400 national and local organisations to offer help and advice. ‘But it is only right that we take action against persistent non-payers on behalf of those who do pay.’ Back in the courts, those women I spoke to after their appearance were contrite for having not paid for their TV licence. But they certainly did not believe their behaviour was criminal.","Prosecutors race through scores of identical cases repeating a formula of allegations, pleas and excuses .

"Scientists have confirmed that 15 pounds of meteorite from Mars fell in Morocco last July. It is only the fifth time in history scientists have chemically confirmed Martian meteorites that people witnessed falling. The last shower that was found 'fresh' - and thus uncontaminated by Earth chemicals -  was in 1962. The rocks are incredibly valuable - 10 times more precious than gold - because no Mars rover or lander has yet returned Martian material to Earth. The only source for Martian rock is these showers. A Martian meteorite recovered in December 2011 near Foumzgit, Morocco following a meteorite shower believed to have occurred in July 2011 . The meteorites could be crucial to our search for life on Mars. The fireball was spotted in the sky six . months ago, but the rocks weren’t discovered on the ground in North . Africa until the end of December. Scientists and collectors of meteorites are ecstatic, and already the rocks are fetching huge sums. A special committee of meteorite experts, including some NASA scientists, confirmed the test results Tuesday. They certified that 15 pounds of meteorite recently collected came from Mars. The biggest rock weighs over 2 pounds. All the known Martian rocks on Earth add up to less than 240 pounds. The surface of Mars: Scientists believe that the meteorites came from an ancient impact on the planet . Astronomers think millions of years ago something big smashed into Mars and sent rocks hurtling through the solar system. After a long journey through space, one of those rocks plunged through Earth’s atmosphere, splitting into smaller pieces. Most other Martian meteorite samples sat around on Earth for millions of years - or at the very least decades - before they were discovered, which makes them tainted with Earth materials and life. These new rocks are purer. The last time a Martian meteorite fell and was found fresh was in 1962. Most of the Martian rocks on Earth have been around for centuries or longer and have been found in Antarctica or the desert. They look so similar to dark Earth rocks that if they fell in other places, such as Maryland, they would blend right in and never be discovered, Irving said. Scientists can tell they are Martian, because as Mars is more geologically active, its . rocks tend to be much younger - millions of years old instead of . hundreds of millions or more - than those from the moon or asteroids. The meteorites were scooped up by dealers and sold on - fetching huge sums as material from Mars is so rare. The total amount of Martian rock on Earth is 240lb . The new samples were scooped up by dealers from those who found them. Even before the official certification, scientists at NASA, museums and universities scrambled to buy or trade these meteorites. 'It’s a free sample from Mars. That’s what these are, except you have to pay the dealers for it,' said University of Alberta meteorite expert Chris Herd, who heads the committee that certified the discovery. He has already bought a chunk of meteorite and said he was thrilled just to hold it, calling the rock 'really spectacular.' One of the key decisions the scientists made Tuesday was to officially connect these rocks to the fiery plunge witnessed by people and captured on video last summer. The announcement and the naming of these meteorites - called Tissint - came from the International Society for Meteoritics and Planetary Science, which is the official group of 950 scientists that confirms and names meteorites. Meteorite dealer Darryl Pitt, who sold a chunk to Herd, said he charges $11,000 to $22,500 an ounce and has sold most of his supply already. At that price, the new Martian rock costs about 10 times more than gold. 'It’s scientifically invaluable,' Herd said. 'These are really beautiful specimens. It’s a rare type, so fresh and aesthetically pleasing.' Because known Martian meteorite falls happen only once every 50 years or so - 1815 in France, 1865 in India, 1911 in Egypt and 1962 in Nigeria - this is a once-in-a-career or even one-in-a-lifetime event.","Rare shower is first found 'fresh' since 1962 .

"Ever wondered what Victoria Beckham's spirit animal is? Or whether she has any nicknames for her children. Well now you can find out. For the fashion designer has revealed all about her life in a new online video for Vogue.com. As part of the fashion bible's 73 Questions series she reveals her favourite drink, her best fashion secret and why she never smiles. Scroll down for video . The first thing Victoria Beckham does each day is check on her children, she tells Vogue.com . In the video Victoria walks around her new Dover Street store, London, answering the questions with a wry smile on her face, her tongue firmly in her cheek. 'What's the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning?,' the interviewer asks. 'I check on my kids,' says the 40-year-old. She goes on to reveal that she works out at 6am daily, sunset orange is her favourite colour and 12 Years A Slave is the film that makes her cry the most. Perhaps her sweetest confession comes when asked about her former footballer husband David Beckham. The interviewer asks what her ideal date would be to which she answered: 'A night in with my husband.' Does she believe in love of first sight? 'Absolutely,' she replies. During the interview Victoria led the Vogue team around her Mayfair store wearing a chic white coat . At one point during the video the interviewer asks the fashion designer to try a pair of her own sunglasses . Asked if she could have a day with anyone in history, living or dead, she answers without hesitation, 'my husband'. Victoria also assures viewers that David loves everything in her wardrobe but she wasn't a fan of that 'full-on Gucci look that he pushed a few years ago'. And if she could take back one outfit, it was 'the full Gucci look in leather that I wore a few years ago.' The singer-turned-fashion mogul says that, 'salt,' is her favourite food and joked that, 'posh,' is her favourite spice. She says that her secret skill is that: 'I used to be able to juggle,' and that her ultimate fashion lesson is, 'less is more'. During the interview Victoria tries on a pair of her own sunglasses displayed in a case in her store . Victoria takes a question from a man on an iPad who asks her advice on his engagement ring . Victoria is the latest in a long line of celebrities to be asked Vogue's 73 Questions. The questions change depending on the celebrity and the location of the shoot is always specific to the person. When Sarah Jessica Parker took part in the interview they spoke to her at her New York home while Blake Lively's interview involved making cupcakes as she's a keen baker. In a touching moment Victoria - who says that Napa Valley in northern California, is her favourite holiday destination - reveals that her children Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper have taught her to love unconditionally. Victoria takes one question from a man in America who wants her advice on whether he should give his girlfriend his grandmother's old engagement ring or buy her a new one. The designer says that she would go with new and he shouldn't give her, 'that ropey old thing.' During the 73 Questions interview Posh leads the interviewer and his camera around her store . Victoria's own shop, showcasing her designs, opened in Dover Street, London, In September . Victoria, who seems to be floating around her shop in the film, is asked what her worst question to be asked is and says it is, 'Why don't you ever smile'. She then jokes that she's smiling on the inside and the reason she never breaks into a grin is because: 'I feel that I have a responsibility to the fashion community.' Victoria opened her first store in September having launched her fashion empire in 2008. Since then the business has gone from strength to strength. It has previously been reported that following the success of her UK store Victoria has hopes to open stores in America and Japan. Victoria said that her children, pictured here at one of her shows in 2014, have taught her to love unconditionally .","Victoria, 40, took part in a video interview with the US fashion bible .

"You may think that your Teflon-coated frying pan is pretty good at repelling water. But scientists have now made metals so hydrophobic - literally meaning water fearing - that droplets bounce off them. Unlike Teflon, which is a coating applied to metal, researchers used lasers to etch microscopic patterns into metal, giving it the ‘super’ property. Scroll down for video . Scientists have used lasers to etch a nanostructure into metals, making them so hydrophobic, or water repellent, that water droplets bounce off the surface, when sprinkled from a height (pictured) Scientists at the University of Rochester in New York, believe their invention could be used to prevent rust, stop airplanes icing up, improve sanitation in developing countries and to make efficient and low maintenance solar panels. Chunlei Guo and Anatoliy Vorobyev, of the university’s Institute of Optics, used a precise laser-patterning technique to create an intricate pattern of nanoscale structures in metal. To make water roll off a Teflon-coated material (as used in the frying pan shown), it needs to be titled to a 70 degree angle, whereas Professor Guo’s material only needs to be titled less than five degrees before liquid slides off and is said to be super hydrophobic . To create the water repellent material, scientists used extremely powerful, ultra-short laser pulses to etch a nanostructure - microscopic patterns - into metal and change its surface. A femtosecond laser pulse lasts just of a quadrillionth of a second but at its peak, reaches a power equivalent to the entire power grid of North America. The etchings are part of the surface so they won't rub off, unlike a Teflon coating, for example. The new material is so water repellent that water droplets bounce off it. The researchers claim it's more slippery than Teflon. To make water roll off a Teflon-coated material, it needs to be titled to a 70 degree angle, whereas Professor Guo’s material only needs to be titled less than five degrees before liquid slides off. They are exploring its self-cleaning properties too. The material allows water droplets to collect dust, cleaning the surface and leaving it dry. It could be used to prevent rust, stop airplanes icing up and to make efficient and low maintenance solar panels. They used extremely powerful, but ultra-short, laser pulses - which despite lasting a quadrillionth of a second, reach a power equivalent to the entire power grid of North America -  to change the surface of the metals. Their work builds on earlier research by the team in which they used a similar laser-patterning technique to turn metals black. Professor Guo explained that the technique creates surfaces that not only repel water, but are also absorb light effectively. ‘The structures created by our laser on the metals are intrinsically part of the material surface,’ he said, so that they won’t rub off like a coating. It is the patterns that make the metals repel water. ‘The material is so strongly water repellent, the water actually gets bounced off,’ the professor of optics said. ‘Then it lands on the surface again, gets bounced off again, and then it will just roll off from the surface. The etched metals are more slippery than Teflon, which is a common hydrophobic material that’s often used to coat non-stick pans. To make water roll off a Teflon-coated material, it needs to be titled to a 70 degree angle, whereas Professor Guo’s material only needs to be titled less than five degrees before liquid slides off. Chunlei Guo and Anatoliy Vorobyev, of the university’s Institute of Optics, used a powerful and precise laser-patterning technique to create an intricate pattern of micro and nanoscale structures to give the metals their new water repellent property. A droplet bouncing off the material is shown . Scientists at the University of Rochester in New York, believe their invention could be used to prevent rust, stop airplanes icing up and in solar panels. Here, a jet wing is deiced by a specialist machine . Unlike Teflon, it’s described as being super-hydrophobic and as water rolls off the laser-etched surface of metals, it also collects dust particles, cleaning the surface. To test this self-cleaning property, his team took ordinary dust from a vacuum cleaner and dumped it onto a treated surface. Professor Guo hopes that the hydrophobic material could make water collection more efficient in developing countries. Here, a girl in Ghana makes a labour-intensive trip to fetch water . Roughly half of the dust particles were removed with just three drops of water and it only took a dozen drops to leave the surface spotless. The surface was also left completely dry, meaning that if it was used to coat pans in the future, washing up could be much easier. Professor Guo is excited about the potential applications of super-hydrophobic materials in developing countries and the research his supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. ‘In these regions, collecting rain water is vital and using super-hydrophobic materials could increase the efficiency without the need to use large funnels with high-pitched angles to prevent water from sticking to the surface,’ he said. ’A second application could be creating latrines that are cleaner and healthier to use.’ However, before pans and water-collecting equipment can become a reality, a faster method for etching metals has to be created. It currently takes an hour to pattern a metal sample measuring one square inch. The researchers are also looking into ways of applying the technique to other, non-metal materials. Professor Guo believes that the technique could be used to create multifunctional metals. Turning metals black makes them efficient at absorbing light, which when combined with water repellent properties, could lead to more efficient and rust-proof solar panels that don’t need cleaning. The team has also used lasers to attract water to materials. This proved so effective, that they managed to make a drop of water run ‘uphill’ when put into contact with the hydrophilic material. The study was published in the Journal of Applied Physics.","Scientists at the University of Rochester in New York used powerful laser pulses to etch microscopic patterns called nanostructures into metals .

"A heartbroken woman is believed to have hanged herself after her parents died just days apart, her family have revealed. Cassie Richardson, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, had struggled for four years following the death of her parents Tony and Janice in April, 2010. The young mother - who has a 17-year-old daughter Sophie - was said to have been found hanged at the seafront on December 28, in Thornton Cleveleys, and her funeral is due to take place today. Cassie Richardson (right), pictured with her daughter Sophie, (left), is believed to have hanged herself after her parents died just days apart, her family have revealed . Ms Richardson, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, suffered with depression for four years following the death of her parents Tony and Janice (pictured) in April, 2010 . Ms Richardson's mother was diagnosed with cancer in March, 2010, and just one week later she passed away from pneumonia. Then, just one day after her mother's funeral, her father suffered a massive internal bleed . Now her family have urged those suffering with depression to seek help. Her brother John, 40, said: 'I urge anybody struggling with the loss of a loved one to reach out and ask for help. 'Whether it is a family member, a friend or an organization or bereavement service - please don't suffer in silence. 'My little sister decided enough was enough and left us behind to be reunited with our parents, aged only 34, and the loss of Cassie left a huge void in our lives. 'But my hope is that somebody reading this will think twice before harming themselves and in turn those around the that love them dearly.' Her family said that the 34-year-old had struggled to come to terms with losing both of her parents in close succession.

"An over-zealous traffic warden appeared to slap a 'parking ticket' on a wheelie bin after it was left blocking the road on double yellow lines. The warden was slammed by shocked motorists who watched him attach the penalty charge envelope to the large Biffa waste bin. The council employee's conducted is now being investigated by local authority in Carmarthen, West Wales. A wheelie bin in Carmarthen, West Wales, was given a £30 parking ticket after it was left blocking the road on double yellow lines . Salesman Mike Jones said: 'It was bizarre - I realised had just watched a warden give a ticket to a wheelie bin for bad parking.' Mr Jones, 54, spotted the warden talking to other motorists about the wheelie bin from a town centre shop blocking the road. 'It appeared the warden slapped the plastic ticket envelope on the bin in a moment of hi-jinx after a member of public pointed out it was parked on double yellow lines,' he said. 'I saw him doing it and pulled in and took the pictures. What's the point of putting it on the bin? 'How could it be enforced? After all a wheelie bin doesn't have a registration plate. 'I just thought it was a total waste of council resources and time. 'I'm sure he could have been doing something better.' The local council said the Biffa bin, pictured above, was not actually issued with a parking ticket and that the officer had wrapped the envelope around the handle in a 'light-hearted' moment . The local authority has launched an investigation into the conduct of the enforcement officer after he appeared to give the bin, pictured above, a ticket . The traffic warden faced a booking of his own - when his bosses 'launched a formal investigation into the conduct of this officer'. Carmarthenshire Council Traffic and safety manager John McEvoy said: 'The officer was patrolling the area when a member of the public pointed out that the wheelie bin was an obstruction, and asked if he was going to book it. The bin was issued with the ticket in Mansel Street, Carmathen, West Wales . 'The officer, in a light-hearted moment, wrapped a Penalty Charge Notice envelope around the bin handle. 'There was no ticket issued, it is not possible to book a wheelie bin or anything that is not motorised. 'Although this was meant as a humorous incident, we take this kind of thing very seriously and have launched a formal investigation into the conduct of this officer.' A spokesman for waste collection company Biffa said 'It's a relief to learn that the bin in question isn't in trouble with the council. 'The ticket issued was simply a throw-away gesture and proved to be a load of rubbish.

"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today said it was a 'tough fight against time' to free two hostages the Islamic State  is threatening to kill within 72 hours. Mr Abe returned to Tokyo from a Middle East tour as a result to the hostage crisis and told reporters he was consulting with leaders in the region. He said he instructed officials to use all possible diplomatic channels to seek the hostages' release. Abe and other officials have not said directly whether or not Japan was considering paying the $200million in ransom being demanded for the captives, Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa. Earlier, government spokesman Yoshihide Suga confirmed that Japan believed the threat to be authentic and emphasised that Japan's aid to the region was not a threat to Muslims. Scroll down for video .

'Tough fight against time': Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (centre) speaks to reporters after holding a crisis meeting at the prime minister's official residence in Tokyo to tackle to hostage crisis . Goto and Yukawa appeared in the latest ISIS video in which the terror group warns they will be beheaded unless their government pays a $200m ransom. It came two days after Mr Abe pledged the same amount in non-military support for countries fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The video, identified as being made by the group's al-Furqan media arm and posted on militant websites associated with the extremist group, mirrored other hostage threats it has made. The clip, posted on militant websites associated with the extremist group, featured the British-accented militant widely known as 'Jihadi John' who appeared in the beheading videos of four Western hostages last year. The mass killer appears on the video clad in his now familiar black and towering over two captives wearing orange jumpsuits and kneeling in the desert. He holds a serrated-edge knife similar to the one he used during the murders of five Western hostages. The video is probably the clearest so far released by IS. Last night, British and US investigators were examining it for clues as to precisely where it was filmed – apparently a rocky desert hillside somewhere inside Syria. In a one-minute 40-second rant, the Briton – speaking with a clear English accent – warns Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ‘this knife will become your nightmare’ if the ransom – the equivalent of £130million – is not paid within 72 hours. Seeking a new life: Yukawa is a 42-year-old widower who reportedly has a history of attempted suicide and self-mutilation after his military goods business went bankrupt and his wife died of cancer . It is the first time that Jihadi John – whose identity is known to the security services – has been seen this year and the first time that IS has publicly demanded a ransom. Fuelling speculation that he might be considering paying the ransom, Mr Abe vowed to save hostages Kenji Goto Jogo and Haruna Yukawa, declaring their lives were his ‘top priority’ and warning Japan would not give in to terrorism. Yukawa is a 42-year-old widower who reportedly has a history of attempted suicide and self-mutilation after his military goods business went bankrupt and his wife died of cancer. He even considered cutting off his genitals because of his perceived failures in life, deciding that he would instead 'live as a woman and leave the rest to destiny'. He travelled to Iraq and Syria last year after telling friends and family that he thought it represented a last chance to turn his life around. Pictures on his Facebook page show him in Iraq and Syria in July. In the line of fire: Footage on Kenji Goto Jogo's last Twitter post in October shows him talking in front of the Syrian city of Kobani (above), which has been under siege from ISIS fighters for months . One video on his page showed him test-firing a Kalashnikov assault rifle with the caption: 'Syria war in Aleppo 2014.' In his last blog post, he says: 'I cannot identify the destination. But the next one could be the most dangerous.' He added: 'I hope to film my fighting scenes during an upcoming visit.' He came to widespread attention in Japan when he appeared in footage posted last August in which he was shown being roughly interrogated by his captors. Yukawa's father, Shoichi Yukawa, has declined to comment, saying he was overwhelmed by the news reports of capture by ISIS. Goto is a freelance journalist, born in 1967, who set up a video production company, named Independent Press in Tokyo in 1996, feeding video documentaries on the Middle East and other regions to Japanese television networks, including public broadcaster NHK. He had been out of contact since late October after telling family that he intended to return to Japan, NHK reported. Goto met Yukawa last year and helped him travel to Iraq in June, he told Reuters in August. Footage on his last Twitter post in October shows him talking in front of the Syrian city of Kobani, which has been under siege from ISIS fighters for several months. In early November, his wife received e-mail demands for about one billion yen ($8.5 million) in ransom from a person claiming to be an Islamic State group member, Fuji TV said. The e-mailed threats were later confirmed to have come from a sender implicated in the killing of U.S. journalist Foley, Fuji TV said.","Shinzo Abe has flown back to Tokyo from Middle East to tackle the crisis .

"A man with a pair of scissors sticking out of his head stunned hospital staff when he  walked into A&E and politely asked staff if they could help him. Blood-soaked Jonas Acevedo Monroy, 32, was nicknamed 'The Gentleman' because of his good manners. Mr Monroy had been in his local bar in the city of Chihuahua in north-western Mexico, when  a jealous rival came over and began to hassle him. His friend Nandor Altamirano Carvajal, 30, said: 'Jonas was as always full of high spirits and was being charming with everyone in the bar when one of the locals took umbrage. Jonas Acevedo Monroy, 32, was stabbed in the head by a rival in a bar. When he arrived at hospital he calmly asked A&E staff for help. Initially they thought it was a joke, but helped him when he fainted . 'He came over and started trying to wind Jonas up, but when that didn't work he started getting abusive and aggressive. 'Jonas offered to buy the man a drink but the guy pulled out a pair of scissors from his jacket and stabbed him in the head. 'What he was doing with a pair of scissors in his pocket I don't know, it was really shocking.' Mr Armendariz, 30, fled, leaving Mr Caravajal to help his bleeding friend to his car and drive him to the hospital. When he arrived at A&E, Mr Monroy politely told staff 'I have a small problem.' At first staff thought the scissors in his head were some sort of joke, but after Mr Monroy collapsed, they rushed him into the emergency room. A hospital spokesman said: 'Staff were very surprised when the two walked in and the man with the scissors in his head shook the receptionist's hand and said he seemed to have a small problem and would the receptionist mind helping him. 'He had been stabbed in the upper-left side of his skull and the scissors had penetrated his parietal brain lobe. 'He is lucky to be alive.' Mr Monroy had been stabbed in the left side of his skull, in the part of his brain called the paretial lobe, which is responsible for sensations, perception and spatial awareness. 'He is lucky to be alive', doctors said . The parietal lobes are the parts of the brain responsible for sensations, perception, processing sensory information into a visual image and spatial co-ordination. People with damage to their parietal lobes show abnormalities in body image and spatial relations, according to the U.S.' Centre For Neuro Skills. Damage to the left parietal lobe, the part of the brain injured in Mr Monroy's case, can sometimes result in Gerstmann's Syndrome, which leaves people confused about left and right and with difficulty writing and with mathematics. It can also produce language disorders, the inability to perceive objects normally and affect verbal memory and the ability to recall digits. Injuries where an object has penetrated the head are rare but are a potentially life threatening condition, according to the Asian Journal of Neurosurgery. The news comes after MailOnline reported on the case of a Brazilian man, Juacelo Nunes, (pictured) who drove for two hours with a knife in his head after being stabbed at a party . Stab wounds found in the skull from sharp edge weapons like knives are common in South Africa, because of very strict gun control laws, the journal said. There are high incidences of stab wounds of the left side of the skull when people are hit from the front, probably because most assailants are right-handed, it added. The news comes after MailOnline reported on the case of a Brazilian man who drove for two hours with a knife in his head after being stabbed at a party. Juacelo Nunes travelled 60 miles from the remote village of Agua Branca to the municipality of Teresina – both in northeastern Piaui state, despite having a 30cm knife sticking out of the side of his skull. Upon arriving at the hospital with the blade still embedded in his head, doctors discovered the 39-year-old had severed nerves and veins in his face - injuries that could easily have proved fatal. But despite the serious nature of his injuries, the motorcycle taxi driver made a full recovery and was allowed out of hospital to celebrate New Year at home with his wife.","Jonas Acevedo Monroy, 32, was stabbed in the head in a bar .

"'Possessive' Nathan Lloyd put revenge porn on his ex-girlfriend's Instagram account, changed the password so she could not take it down and then called her a 's***' when she asked him to remove it . A dumped boyfriend who posted a 'revenge porn' picture of his ex-lover online has avoided jail and was instead ordered to attend a 'building better relationships' course. Nathan Lloyd, 22, put up a photo of his former girlfriend in her underwear on her Instagram account after they broke-up - then changed the password so she couldn't take it down. Despite a move to make the offence subject to a two-year prison sentence, he walked free from court today  after being told to attend a course where he'll learn about 'aggression and relationships'. Lloyd,  of Narberth, west Wales, was sent the picture of the woman while he and she were still together. But after they split up, he logged into her account on the photo sharing website and uploaded the picture. Lloyd also posted a video 'of a sexual nature' onto the page, magistrates heard. A court heard how he then changed her password so she couldn't remove the revealing image. Prosecutor Vaughan Pritchard Jones said: 'When they were together the defendant had access to the victim's Instagram account. 'She ended the relationship because she found him possessive and his behaviour unnerving. 'She became aware that he had posted pictures of her Instagram account. She was unable to change the password and to get into her account and remove them, which she was very upset about.' His victim begged Lloyd to take the image down from her Instagram where she had around 500 followers. But Haverfordwest Magistrates Court heard that Lloyd responded with a torrent of abuse. Mr Pritchard Jones added: 'She sent him another message asking him to take it down. He replied: ""F*** you, s***"".' Despite government moves to increase sentences for the offences, Lloyd walked free from court today after being told he would have to attend a 'building better relationships' course with probation workers . The course is made up of 24 weekly or half-weekly sessions, divided into four modules, called 'Foundation', 'My Thinking', 'My Emotions' and 'My Relationships'. The probation service says the course's aims are to 'help offenders gain a better understanding of themselves [and] show them how their personal issues play a part in the violence they show to their partners'. The course description also states it 'supports offenders to discover their strengths and build on them to improve their relationships and helps offenders to develop their skills and learn new ones to overcome difficulties.' Lloyd admitted breaking the Telecommunications Act by sending an obscene or offensive image. He also admitted charges of criminal damage and resisting a constable in the execution of their duty. The court heard how he was arrested after kicking his ex-girlfriend's door down when she refused to let him in. Lloyd was given a restraining order and told not to contact the victim or post anything about her on the internet. He was also given a 24-month 'Building Better Relationships Order' and told to pay costs totalling £145. Lloyd's case comes ahead of new legislation, expected to come into force later this year, that makes revenge porn a specific offence which could carry a maximum sentence of two years. In December, the CPS launched new guidelines on tackling domestic abuse which will include using technology to inflict misery on former partners. Under the new guidance, prosecutors will be encouraged to consider how revenge porn can be treated as a form of domestic abuse. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said last year: 'We want those who fall victim to this type of disgusting behaviour to know that we are on their side.' Luke King was jailed for posting the explicit image . Those convicted of revenge porn – the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – could face two years in prison under new laws. It will be made a specific offence, covering the sharing of images both online and offline, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. It will mean that images posted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be caught by the offence, as well as those that are shared via text message. Images shared via email, on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught. Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet. Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images. The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions. However, the new rules do not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages. Last year, Luke King, 21, of Nottingham, became the first person to be jailed for revenge porn offences in the UK. After his three-year relationship ended he posted a number of explicit images of his former partner, and changed his WhatsApp icon to one of the images. King was eventually prosecuted under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 after he ignored two police warnings not to share the X-rated images and was jailed for 12 weeks.","Nathan Lloyd posted an explicit video and picture on the victim's account .

"For singletons fed up with their family and friends asking whether they have met ‘that special someone,’ there are two new apps that could help them fake a relationship. The Invisible Girlfriend and Invisible Boyfriend apps will send convincing text messages and even voicemails from a virtual partner as 'proof' of a relationship. It was created so that single people under pressure to find a partner, but who don’t want to date, can practice flirting, or simply use the service to keep well-meaning relatives off their back. The Invisible Boyfriend and Invisible Girlfriend apps (pictured) allow single people to create a partner and their personality, to make it look like they are dating. 'Proof' will be provided in the form of text messages, enabling users to interact with their virtual partner . The St Louis-based company says on its website: ‘Invisible Boyfriend gives you real-world and social proof that you’re in a relationship - even if you’re not - so you can get back to living life on your own terms.’ Currently available as a private beta version in the US and Canada, users will be able to download a gender-specific app and start receiving messages from a fictional partner, for around $25 a month. The monthly subscription will include 100 text messages (examples shown), 10 voicemails and even a handwritten letter . To begin with, they will choose a boyfriend or girlfriend from an ‘extensive library’ before customising the avatar's personality and deciding how they would like to interact. They will be able to share photos and tell a believable back story to their friends about how they met, which can be concocted on the app, choosing from scenarios such as a bar, holiday or even climbing. The monthly subscription will include 100 text messages, 10 voicemails and even a handwritten letter, co-founder Kyle Tabor told Betabeat, although the company says is planning different packages. The idea is that single users can show the plausible messages to friends and family in order to dodge awkward social situations, such as being set up with relatives’ unsuitable acquaintances. ‘Put simply, this platform helps you create credible, reasonable stories that you can bring home to curious mum, your buddies, and co-workers. These stories are backed by virtual and real-world social proof,’ the firm says. Mr Tabor told MailOnline that the texts will be a mixture of automated messages and those written by humans. While ‘proof’ may one day extend to gifts and flowers send by the company and paid for by the user, it has ruled out offering sexts or naked pictures of virtual partners. The apps came about because co-founder Matt Hoffmann was newly divorced and tired of feeling pressurised to date. ‘Around Thanksgiving, my mum called me and asked if she should set an extra place for someone I’m bringing,’ he explained in a blog post. Users will be able to share photos and tell a believable back story to their friends about they and their 'partner' met, which can be concocted on the app, choosing from scenarios such as a bar, holiday or even climbing, as pictured . Prospective users in the US and Canada have to apply to join the private beta, which is launching soon. ‘If accepted, you will receive access to create an account, build a boyfriend, and use all of the services for a small one-time fee,’ the website says. When the app is widely released, users will choose a suitable package and select a boyfriend or girlfriend from a library, then customise his or her personality to their taste and decide how to interact. The main feature of the service is being able to exchange text messages with a virtual girlfriend or boyfriend. They will be able to do this via a dashboard, which they will also be able to use to create personalised stories about how they met. Over time, the company will add voicemails and phone calls. There is also a possibility that the service may also extend to virtual partners sending gifts and flowers – paid for by the user – to enhance the deception, but the company has ruled out offering sexts or naked photos. ‘In that moment I realised how great it would be to have an answer for her that didn’t require me to actually be dating someone.’ The idea of virtual partners won a start-up competition, which encouraged the duo to build the apps. Since then, they have worked out a way of making the text messages sound real so that users can text their invisible partner and receive a prompt reply. In the future, the company is working on a way to give virtual partners a face. ‘In essence, your boyfriend will be someone you’re not ashamed to bring home to mum, a homebody bridging the gap between Plain Jane and a wildcard. Our boyfriends are credible proof who are obtainable and believable,’the company said. The founders think their apps meet a universal problem of society putting pressure on single people to be in a relationship and can be used when someone starts dating too. ‘We’re excited about the ways Invisible Girlfriend and Boyfriend are helping people navigate the dating scene. The service creates a safe space for you to practice texting with a real human if you’re out of practice. ‘Sometimes it even inspires just enough jealousy to jolt that special person into committing,’ they said.","Invisible Girlfriend and Invisible Boyfriend apps will send convincing text messages and even voicemails from a virtual partner .

"A couple born in beds next to each other on the same day in the same hospital ended up getting married - and will next week celebrate their 60th birthdays together. Dave O'Callaghan and Jane Hammond were both born at the Mowbray Maternity Hospital in Exeter, Devon - which has since closed - on January 26, 1955, but didn't meet again until they were 17. The pair soon fell in love and were engaged at 21, before marrying the next year. Dave O'Callaghan and Jane Hammond were born in beds next to each other on the same day in the same Exeter hospital and later got married; on Monday the pair celebrate their 60th birthdays together . The couple, of Exeter, Devon, have been married for 38 years and are celebrating their joint birthday on Monday.They have two children, Lydia, 29, and Imogen, 25. Ms Hammond said the biggest advantage of their parallel existence is that they never forget each other's birthdays. When she asked her husband-to-be's birthday, as first 'I didn't believe him', but the couple have 'never really made much of it'. However, she acknowledges that being 'born in the same hospital on the same day and in the same year is a bizarre coincidence'. 'People are very surprised when we tell them our story. Their reactions make us realise how rare and special it is. The couple didn't meet until they were 17 as they grew up on opposite sides of Exeter, but they soon fell in love and were engaged at 21; the couple are pictured above on their wedding day the following year . Ms Hammond, pictured above at just 11 months old, said her and Mr O'Gallaghan had 'never made much' of their back story, but admitted being born on the same day at the same hospital was 'quite unusual' 'The same day, the same year and the same hospital is quite unusual.' Ms Hammond, who is about three hours older than her husband, she the pair never met growing up as they lived on opposite sides of Exeter. The couple met after Mr O'Callaghan started seeing a friend of his wife-to-be. Ms Hammond, who works at the student health clinic at Exeter University, said of their first meeting: 'He was more interested in me than I was in him. I was invited to his 18th birthday party - as I wasn't really celebrating mine. 'My friend that he was seeing came up and told me 'it is not me he wants, it is you.' 'We got together about a month later and things developed from there.' Mr O'Callaghan, who has run a hairdressing business for 30 years, said of his relationship: ''We have had a really good life together and we have two lovely girls.' The couple will celebrate their joint birthday with a large gathering of family and friends.","The couple lived on different sides of Exeter and hadn't met each other .

"Armin Wand III was convicted of murdering his three sons by setting fire to his rented house in Wisconsin . A father convicted of burning his three young sons to death to collect on their life insurance policies wants to withdraw his guilty plea. Armin Wand III, 35, of Argyle, Wisconsin, claims he was tricked into confessing to crimes he didn't commit according to a petition filed in Lafayette County Circuit Court on January 12. If a judge decides to grant the motion, Armin would have the chance to request a new trial in a bid to get his three life sentences reduced or overturned. According to a criminal report issued in 2012, Armin lived in a rental house in Argyle, a village of 850 people about 45 miles southwest of Madison, with his wife, Sharon, 27, and their four children. He told state agents that he started talking with his teenage brother, Jeremy, in early September about killing his family in a fire to collect on their life insurance policies. Wand told the agents he wanted to make a 'fresh start', the complaint said. He said he was tired of his family living pay check to pay check and listening to his wife’s complaints about wanting more money. She also was contemplating divorce, he said. Jeremy Wand told investigators his brother offered him $300 from the insurance payout if he helped him, the complaint said. Together they set the house on fire in the morning of September 7 as the rest of the family slept, the complaint said. The pair reportedly lit some paper in the living room near the plug for the television, so it would look like an electrical blaze. Armin’s three boys - seven-year-old Allen, five-year-old Jeffrey and three-year-old Joseph - died in the blaze. Sharon Wand, who was 17 weeks pregnant, woke up and rescued her two-year-old daughter, Jessica. When she handed the girl to Armin he tried to put her back in the house through a broken window, the complaint said. Brothers: Three children were killed in the blaze. Jeffrey, center, Allen, left and Joseph, right . Devastated: Armin's wife Sharon Wand (left, before the blaze, and right, after) suffered third-degree burns to 70 per cent of her body she also lost the baby she was carrying . A woman stopped him before he could do it, though. The girl wasn’t seriously hurt, but Mrs Wand suffered burns, the complaint said. A beam also fell on her, and her unborn baby died as a result of her injuries, the children’s grandmother told the Wisconsin State Journal newspaper. Sharon Wand suffered third-degree burns to 70 per cent of her body. Jeremy Wand was sentenced to life in prison for helping his brother murder his own children in a house fire. Armin reportedly started talking with his brother, Jeremy (pictured above right), in September 2012 about killing his family in a fire to collect on their life insurance policies - now he wants his guilty plea overturning . Armin Wand III pleaded guilty to charges including three intentional homicide charges and an arson charge in February 2013 and was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences. However, now he wants a judge to overturn his plea. If the request is denied, defense attorney Patricia Fitzgerald tells the State Journal she will ask the state Court of Appeals to overturn it. She said Armin was easy for authorities to manipulate because he’s 'very compliant and he’s borderline mentally retarded.' He is currently at the state prison in Boscobel.","Armin Wand III, 35, of Argyle, claims he was tricked into confessing to crimes he didn't commit .

"Russia has hit out at President Barack Obama's State of the Union address saying it showed the United States is seeking world domination. During the speech last night, Mr Obama said the U.S. was upholding 'the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small' by opposing what he called Russian president Vladimir Putin's aggression and supporting democracy in Ukraine. But now the Russians have claimed the speech showed how the United States believes it is 'number one' and is unable to be an equal. Scroll down for video . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who said America had 'taken a course of confrontation' following President Obama's State of the Union address . Today Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a new conference that America had taken 'a course of confrontation'. He said: 'Yesterday's speech by the president shows that at the centre of the U.S. philosophy is only one thing: ""We are number one and everybody else has to respect that."" 'It shows that the United States wants all the same to dominate the world and cannot merely be a first among equals. 'I would prefer all countries to adopt the philosophy of co-operation, not diktat.' During yesterday's address President Obama specifically referred to Russia and the conflict in Ukraine. He said: 'We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small - by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine's democracy and reassuring our NATO allies. During his speech yesterday, Obama, left, called out Russian president Vladimir Putin, right, and his aggression . 'Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr Putin's aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength. 'Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters.' President Obama's warning came after he and British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to keep sanctions on Russia until it stops its aggression in Ukraine. On Friday after talks in Washington Mr Obama said: 'We agree on the need to maintain strong sanctions against Russia until it ends its aggression in Ukraine, and on the need to support Ukraine as it implements important economic and democratic reforms.' Relations between Russia and the United States have sunk to their lowest level since the end of the Cold War, mainly because of Moscow's confrontation with the West over the crisis in Ukraine.","Barack Obama said the U.S. was opposing Russia's aggression to Ukraine .

"A Ukip general election candidate has apologised after a Twitter spat in which he appeared to suggest a German woman may have a sexually transmitted disease. In a statement issued by Ukip, the party said Dr Jonathan Munday accepted that his comments in response to on-line 'carping' about his party's attitude to the NHS had been foolish. Dr Munday, who works as a GP, drew criticism on Twitter after responding to a tweet claiming Ukip leader Nigel Farage did not support the NHS. Dr Jonathan Munday wrote to a voter on Twitter: Both Nigel and I support the NHS. I have worked in it for 31 years. What has been your contribution - Piles and STD?' Essex-born Dr Jonathan Munday lives in Northamptonshire and plans to contest Tory-held Wellingborough and Rushden in May's general election . In his reply to the post, Dr Munday wrote: 'Both Nigel and I support the NHS. I have worked in it for 31 years. What has been your contribution - Piles and STD?' Essex-born Dr Jonathan Munday lives in Northamptonshire and plans to contest Tory-held Wellingborough and Rushden in May's general election. In a statement issued after yesterday's Twitter row, a Ukip spokesman said: 'Dr Munday accepts that his response was foolish, and apologises for that, but after a long day in his surgery he was annoyed by false carping claims that he didn't care for the NHS. 'He feels that his 30 years as a GP stands for itself in his support for the NHS and our healthcare system.' The row comes after Mr Farage accused David Cameron of having 'openly lied' in the Commons when he claimed Ukip would privatise the NHS. During Prime Minister Question's, Mr Cameron said 'Ukip policy' was to sell off the health service. But Mr Farage immediately took to Twitter to attack Mr Cameron. Mr Cameron made the comments after former Tory MP Mark Reckless, who defected to UKIP last year, asked why he would not commit to taking part in TV debates with Nigel Farage ahead of the general election. Ukip MP Mark Reckless was called to ask a question during Prime Minister's Questions this afternoon . The Prime Minister turned on Mr Reckless saying 'Ukip policy' was to sell off the health service . The Prime Minister replied: 'I made my views very clear, if we're going to have one minor party we should have all the minor parties and when this happens one point I will be making is what he said, Mr Farage, in 2012 about the NHS. 'The honourable gentleman [Mr Reckless] comes to this House week after week to talk about the NHS in Kent, well Mr Farage said this: 'We're going to have to move to an insurance based system of health care'. 'That is the UKIP policy, to privatise the NHS. I say never.' Mr Farage tweeted: 'The Prime Minister just openly lied during PMQs.' Ukip's health spokesman Louise Bours yesterday publicly slapped down Mr Farage after he suggested the NHS may need to be privatised to cope with the growing pressure on the health budget caused by a rapidly-ageing population. The Ukip leader claimed that privatising large parts of the NHS was 'a debate that we're all going to have to return to' if the health service was going to stay affordable. Within hours of the remarks Ukip's Health Spokesman, Louise Bours, insisted Mr Farage was out of touch with the public when it came to the NHS. She said: 'Nigel is entitled to his opinion and others are entitled to theirs, we don't whip people into all thinking the same thing, like the establishment parties. 'As he has said before, he raised the idea for discussion a while ago, the party discussed at and rejected it. 'I am certain that if the party discuss it again, we will reject it again.

"She’s known for her perfect figure and dazzled viewers with her foxtrot in the tenth series of Strictly Come Dancing. But Denise Van Outen has revealed she's never followed a fad diet and doesn’t deliberately cut out any foods entirely. In fact, she claims she ‘not a big one for getting on the scales’ and ‘couldn’t tell you’ what she weighs today, she told MailOnline. Instead of bathroom scales, she has a favourite pair of skinny jeans. They work as her weight-gauge: if she can’t fit into them, she knows she has to hit the gym. Scroll down for video . Denise Van Outen says she keeps slim by being 'sensible': she doesn't do fat diets but avoids carbs in the afternoon and runs on a treadmill while watching TV . While she was crowned 'Rear of the Year' in 1999, she says she likes to keep her legs in shape so she can wear her favourite skinny jeans and pencil skirts . Her mantra over the last ten years has been to eat and exercise ‘sensibly’, and she says she has to keep fit as her job as a West End actress demands it. ‘Especially the industry I work in, if you look good and you’re healthy, you feel good,’ she said. ‘If I gain weight, I feel sluggish. You’re not jumping out of bed, ready to tackle the day.’ Though she was crowned Rear of the Year in 1999, her legs are the main focus of her exercise. ‘I try and keep my legs in good shape. I like to wear my skinny jeans and pencil skirts,’ she says. And harking back to her earlier days as an Essex ladette, she admits she still drinks too much on holiday and can’t resist crisps. ‘I don’t have a sweet tooth, I’m lucky. So I don’t have to worry about cakes and biscuits,’ she told MailOnline. ‘I like crisps - I could devour a whole bag of them watching my favourite TV shows.’ She says she gained around two stone after having her daughter, and often puts on weight over Christmas or after a holiday – but finds it easy to cut down afterwards. 'My daughter Betsy is my motivation for everything,' Ms Van Outen says. Though she lives her life in the public eye, her daughter  allows her to stay mentally strong. 'I'm a mother first before anything else,' she adds . ‘It’s from drinking wine, if you’ve been on holiday. ‘I just cut out the booze to lose weight.’ Her other top tip? Avoiding carbs late at night. ‘I love jacket potatoes. But I have them for lunch so I can burn them off in the afternoon,’ she says. Despite being 40, she says she feels much younger, and isn’t scared by the thought of ageing. ‘I always think “You never feel any older”. The way I behave, it’s like I’m in my early 20s. 'Having a daughter keeps me young. I’ve got an excuse to be young and silly.’ ‘I don’t know how I’ll feel when I’m 50, you’ll have to ask me then.’ A fifth of Britons would give up chocolate or Facebook for a year in order to lose a stone, a survey has found. People said they would consider giving up alcohol forever (19 per cent), stop watching their favourite soap (15 per cent) and some even said they would give up sex for a year (11 per cent) in order to lose weight. The research was commissioned by XLS Medical, which manufactures weight loss supplements. The survey found that collectively, British people want to lose a total of 67.2m stone this year, and almost a third are looking to lose up to two stone. But the research revealed that by January 31, more than half of New Year diets (56 per cent) will be dead. A fifth of Britons would delete their Facebook account in order to lose a stone, according to a survey . It highlighted the plethora of excuses we make to allow ourselves to resume unhealthy eating. Top excuses were: 'it's too cold to exercise' (17 per cent) and 'you don’t see the results quickly enough' (21 per cent). XLS Medical iS now searching for people to take part in a new weight loss documentary series, fronted by Denise Van Outen. They will be guided through a slimming programme, with the highs and lows of their weight loss journey charted on camera. To enter the XLS-Medical documentary, as well as starring in the next TV advert, visit www.xls-medical.co.uk . As well as taking part in the BBC show Strictly Come Dancing, she is the voice of reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex, whose stars are famous for their fake tans and plastic surgery. While she’s currently not considering going under the knife, it’s not a move she’s written off. ‘I wouldn’t rule it out one day,’ she said. ‘If anything’s going to make you feel it better, then do it. ‘Some people lose weight, some people change their hair. ‘What I would say is the cast of TOWIE are young. It is an addiction for some people.’ For now, she sticks to a good diet and exercise to keep middle age spread and wrinkles at bay. She has both a treadmill and an exercise bike in her home - which she likes to use in front of the TV - and says signing up for charity events keeps her motivated. ‘I’ve cycled through Rajasthan, climbed the Great Wall of China and I’m just about to cycle across Vietnam and Cambodia’ she says. If she gains weight by drinking too much on holiday or eating too much over Christmas, Ms Van Outen just puts on a pair of unforgiving skinny jeans. If they are too tight, she knows she needs to hit the gym. She is pictured out and about in London (left) and appearing on BBC show Strictly Come Dancing (right) ‘That gives me the motivation to exercise and keep going because I’ve got a target.’ She enjoys being part of a team and hearing other people’s stories. On her last trip, one lady was beating cancer, which struck a chord with her as she lost her grandmother to the disease. She became an ambassador for charity Breast Cancer UK afterwards, carries out breast examinations and  always gets regular check ups herself. This is one of the reasons she wants to inspire healthy living and weight loss in others. But she says other people can lose weight and stick to an exercise regime even if they don’t sign up to such ‘extreme’ events as the ones she’s taken part in. Ms Van Outen is pictured celebrating her 40th birthday in May this year. But she told MailOnline she is not scared by the thought of ageing . She says: ‘I’m not a weight loss expert. 'I can speak for me and my friends. One of my friends signed up for a 10km walk and it really motivated her. ‘I’ve got friends who have signed up for stuff and it changes their outlook.’ This is why she has paired up with XLS Medical, a food supplement that claims to aid weight loss. The company creates tablets and sachets which are eaten  after meals, poured straight into the mouth without any water. It's claimed the products stop the digestion of fat and carbohydrates. Clinical studies published in the journal Obesity found that people using XLS Medical's Fat Binder product or Carb Blocker product lost three times as much weight after 12 weeks as those taking  placebo tablets. Ms Van Outen is now searching for women to take part in a weight loss documentary. They will go through a slimming programme, with the highs and lows of their journey recorded on camera. She told MailOnline: ‘I got involved because I believe in successful weight loss. ‘It will be great to see how these women have changed their lives and go on a journey with them, hearing their stories. ‘You don’t have to do the whole course. I even signed my mum up to take the tablets. 'She had to get Christmas out of the way, but she loves it now.’ And beneath the glamour and fame of the life of a superstar, she says it is her family that is most important to her; and allows her to stay mentally strong in what can be a superficial industry. ‘My daughter is the motivation for everything,’ she said. ‘When I go home and I come and close the door. The rest is just my job, it doesn’t matter. ‘When I close the door, I’m a mother first, and that’s what matters.’","Denise, 40, says she never weighs herself and 'doesn't do' fat diets .

The war bride and David Jones machinist was last seen on December 30, 2003 when she visited a chemist for a prescription for high-blood pressure. The box of medication was found alongside Ms Wood's belongings when her skeletal remains were found in 2011. A pair of gold earrings, a pair of reading glasses in its case, a walking stick and two pieces of clothing were also found.

"British drinkers are set to spend more on wine the French in the coming years following a boom in sales for more expensive bottles. Britons are increasing buying higher-priced 'premium' wines and now regularly spend more than £7 on a bottle, research reveals. The UK is set to spend more than £11billion on reds, whites and roses by 2018, making it the second biggest market for wine after the US. Britain is set to become the second biggest wine market in the world - spending £11billion on reds, whites and roses . By then, wine consumption will reach reach 1.54billion bottles - the equivalent of 22.5 litres per head - according to a forecast by  International Wine & Spirit Research for wine exhibition Vinexpo. Its report found the amount spent on wine fell during the recession, but is now increasing again as the UK economy recovers. In the last five years, consumers have not been drinking increased amounts of wine - but are instead spending more on bottles when they do have a glass. Overall consumption of wine is, however, now expected to rise for the first time since 2008. The continued popularity of Prosecco is partly behind the increase in trade - with a 43 per rise seen on imports of the Italian sparkling wine in recent years. Between 2008 and 2013, the number of cases of Prosecco brought into Britain more than doubled from 1.38million to 3.57million, the report found. A graph of the top ten wine markets shows Britain is expected to overtake France by 2018. Source: IPSR . Vinexpo's Guillaume Deglise said: 'We can say confidently that 2015 will show that the UK wine recession is over. 'While the UK market shed 9.6million cases between 2008 and 2013, it is now past its low point. The UK wine trade is building value and many leading marketers report progress at the premium end'. White wine is the UK's favourite, with 676.7 million bottles bottles expected to be drunk this year, rising to 698.7 million bottles by 2018. Spanish reds are becoming more popular, as drinkers turn their backs on French wines such as Bordeaux. Imports from Spain rose by 25 per cent between 2009 and 2013 - while imports from Chile, Australia and South Africa dropped. A growth in demand for Spanish wines like Rioja (left) and Italian Prosecco (right) is behind the boom in trade .","Britain will spend more than £11billion on wine by 2018, report predicts .

"A man searching for his wallet inside a dumpster in North Highlands, California was scooped up by a trash truck and trapped inside the rear of it for three hours (file photo) A man searching for his wallet inside a dumpster in North Highlands, California was scooped up by a trash truck and trapped for three hours. He miraculously survived the terrifying ordeal by creating a coffin-like pocket with wooden planks in order to avoid getting crushed. Authorities said the man, who has not been named, could have been run over, killed or even squashed by a compacting blade in the incident on January 13. The man was stuck in the rear of the Atlas garbage truck, as it carried out pick-ups on its way to Yolo County Landfill last week,The Oroville Mercury Register reported. Yolo County Sheriff's Lt. Martin Torres said the man is lucky to be alive. Once the garbage truck arrived at the landfill, the driver saw the man crawl out of the trash pile and the driver of the bulldozer was alerted, said Torres. Luckily the truck was only half full of trash. If it had been filled to capacity a compacted blade would have been used at the bottom of the bin. In addition, garbage trucks can use pressure to compact trash, 'so he could have been squashed,' said Torres. The man was taken to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento for complaints of back and neck pain. He suffered minor injuries from his unexpected trip. Scroll down for video .

Torres said this is the first time he had heard of someone getting stuck in a garbage truck in his 27-year career. However, there have been other incidences involving the public getting trapped in garbage trucks. In 2013 an Arizona homeless woman was found in a garbage truck which collected and crushed up to ten loads of trash after she was dumped into it. Jessica Bunyar, 38, fell asleep in the dumpster when it was picked up by a Copper State Sanitation vehicle in Globe, Arizona. Bunyar was trapped inside the truck's compactor as it travelled for about one mile collecting rubbish bins. The driver only realized he had more than just garbage on board after making ten stops and compacting the load up to ten times.

"Overwhelmed parents no longer need to feel guilty for desperately wanting a moment of peace and quiet. They're not alone. Mothers and fathers are sharing hilarious photos of their parenting blunders and apologizing to their babies on a 'shame-free' website started by a New Jersey mom who found herself laughing about the everyday realities associated with raising a child. Humor writer Sarah Showfety, who has a 22-month-old daughter and another child on the way, came up with the idea for Dear Baby XO after the birth of her baby girl. Scroll down for video . Good humor: New Jersey mom Sarah Showfety designed Dear Baby XO to be a 'shame-free' zone where parents can apologize to their children for harmless mistakes - like taking a photo when they can't get up . Good read: One mom confessed to buying EL James's erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey instead of a toy for her daughter . Peace and quiet: This child was sent to hunt for Cheerios in a canvas bag so her parent could enjoy some time alone . Fully loaded: Another mother confessed to ignoring her daughter's dirty diaper in hopes that her husband would take care of it . Spy games: This mom apologized for forgetting to turn on her child's baby monitor while she was enjoying a snack on the couch . Cute costume: Other parents' acknowledged that they don't always make the best wardrobe choices for their children . 'She was a tough baby,' she told ABC News. 'And one time when she was nursing I had this thought that I wished she would hurry up and finish so I could have a glass of wine.' The thought made her laugh and immediately want to apologize to her baby. It was after that moment that Ms Showfety started keeping a running list of all the inappropriate parenting thoughts that ran through her head on any given day. It occurred to that she wasn't alone in her thinking, and her desire to brighten another parent's day led to the creation of Dear Baby XO. 'I thought, if I'm thinking these un-PC things, other moms must be thinking them too,' she wrote in an essay for Huff Post Parents last week. And I bet they could use a laugh.' Ms Showfety started posting the funny 'Dear Baby' photos on Facebook before she created her website. She also shares pictures and apologies on her site's Instagram and Twitter accounts.

"Tamara Ecclestone and her husband Jay Rutland are rumored to be 'having marital issues' over the fact that the 30-year-old Formula 1 heiress brings their ten-month-old daughter Sophia into their bedroom to sleep with them every night. According to a source close to the couple, who have just returned from a sun-filled getaway in Dubai with their beloved daughter, Jay is threatening to move into the spare room of the couple's luxurious home in Kensington, West London because he is so fed up with the situation. 'Tamara is a bit too protective when it comes to their baby and Jay has insisted that she needs to get an expert to help sleep train Sophia,' the source revealed to MailOnline. Scroll down for video . Happy families: Tamara Ecclestone and her husband Jay Rutland, pictured here with baby Sophia on holiday in Dubai, are said to be arguing over whether their daughter should share their bed . Sweet dreams: Tamara believes that ten-month-old Sophia is happiest when she can sleep with her parents . Proud parents: Both Tamara and Jay are devoted to their daughter and are said to be determined to come up with a solution to their co-sleeping issue that will benefit the whole family . 'Tamara insists that Sophia will cry all night unless she's sleeping with her, but Jay has had enough. 'It is causing a fair amount of friction.' A second source added: 'Tamara is incredibly protective of the baby and loves having her sleeping in her bed. Jay is slightly less tolerant of the situation.' A spokesperson for Tamara confirmed that she and Jay are still working out what is best for their baby, but added that both parents are determined to find the perfect situation that works for all of them - particularly their daughter. 'Like all new parents, Tamara and Jay are learning about the best ways to raise their baby,' the spokesperson told MailOnline. 'However they are committed to creating a happy, healthy future for their daughter.' But while the issue of co-sleeping has divided the otherwise loved-up couple, Tamara, who has own luxury hair care range, Show Beauty, is not alone when it comes to her opinions on where her daughter should sleep. A host of other celebrity mothers, from Angelina Jolie and Gwen Stefani to Heidi Klum and Kourtney Kardashian, have all spoken out in favour of co-sleeping with their children. In 2011, No Doubt frontwoman Gwen told Stylist that she regularly slept with her son Zuma, adding that she loved the extra hours it meant she got to spend with him. Loving father: Jay is an incredibly affectionate dad and loves spending time with his daughter, however he feels that Sophia should be sleeping in her own room . Room for one more? Tamara often posts pictures of her daughter sleeping or playing in her parents' bed to her Instagram account . 'I don’t want to look back and say, ""Oh my God, I didn’t sleep with Zuma that time because I was too tired,"" so I’ll just snuggle up with him tonight,' she said. 'It’s probably why I work as hard as I do - I don’t want to look back and see the things I didn’t do.' According to parenting expert Jo Tantum, many mothers find it hard to leave their babies in a separate room at night, particularly when the baby is having trouble sleeping, and tends to wake crying at regular intervals. However, Jo warned that Tamara and Jay need to try and tackle the issue as soon as possible - or risk Sophia developing into an overly dependent toddler. 'It's really tough when you have a baby that doesn't sleep well,' she told MailOnline. 'And as the baby is ten months old then they really need to change things, otherwise they are going to have a dependent toddler, as they have set themselves up for being in demand 24/7.' Jo suggested that the devoted parents start to implement a few smaller changes in their day-to-day routine, before trying to sleep separately from Sophia, in order to make their daughter feel as happy and comfortable as possible. 'They need to get the baby into a flexible, natural routine,' she added. 'At ten months a baby would naturally need a nap every two and a half hours, and they would be having between two and three milk feeds and three meals a day.

'[That] should send warning bells that maybe things should change. And she can still nature her baby [without needing to sleep with her].' And while some might accuse Jay of being insensitive to the needs of his wife and daughter, Jo insists that issues like this can be especially hard on the fathers. 'I think it's really tough for Dads, especially if it's been ten months of sharing their bed,' she said. 'He still needs to feel part of a family rather than it being mummy and baby and then him.

"Since 1990, scientists have used complex models to predict how climate change and manmade greenhouse emissions will affect the world. But a team of experts - including an astrophysicist, statistician, and geography professor – has claimed these models ‘very greatly exaggerate’ the effects of global warming. Using a simpler, solar-based model, the researchers arrived at figures that are more than half those previously predicted. The researchers tested their ‘simple’ mathematical model against complex models used by climate scientists, such as those involved in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. They also compared predictions against real-world temperature changes. This chart shows how the two observations compared . The paper, ‘Why models run hot: results from an irreducibly simple climate model’, was written by Lord Christopher Monckton of Brenchley, astrophysicist and geoscientist Willie Soon, Professor of Geography at the University of Delaware David Legates, and statistician Dr Matt Briggs. It has been peer reviewed and is published in the journal Science Bulletin. Mathematical equations used for large climate model typically require supercomputers that perform calculations quickly - some make more than 80 million calculations an hour. Sophisticated climate models take into account the amounts of animals and plants, or biosphere, the hydrosphere’s oceans and other bodies of water, sea ice and ice sheets in the cryosphere, and the geosphere, that measures tectonic variations such as volcanic eruptions and moving continents. By comparison, the team’s simple model looked at temperatures caused by so-called anthropogenic radiative forcings and consequent ‘temperature feedbacks’ over a given timeframe.

By comparison, the team’s simple model looked at temperatures caused by so-called anthropogenic radiative forcings and consequent ‘temperature feedbacks’ over a given timeframe. Anthropogenic radiative forcings, put simply, are measured by the difference between the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth, and the energy that is radiated back to space. A temperature feedback is created by albedo - the amount of shortwave radiation from solar energy reflected by Earth. Ice and snow is highly reflective, so has a high albedo, for example. This means the majority of sunlight that hits snow is sent back towards space. When ice and snow melts, as temperatures rise, the darker soil or grass lowers the albedo. This increases the ground’s temperature, causing more snow to melt, leading to a further rise in temperature. Both of these measurements can be used to suggest global temperatures, radiation and energy levels in the atmosphere and the Earth. Anthropogenic radiative forcings, put simply, are measured by the difference between the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth, and the energy that is radiated back to space. A temperature feedback is created by albedo - the amount of shortwave radiation from solar energy reflected by Earth. Ice and snow is highly reflective, so has a high albedo, for example. This means the majority of sunlight that hits snow is sent back towards space. When ice and snow melts, as temperatures rise, the darker soil or grass lowers the albedo. This increases the ground’s temperature, causing more snow to melt, leading to a further rise in temperature. Temperature feedbacks can also be affected by water vapour and cloud cover. Both of these measurements can be used to suggest global temperatures, radiation and energy levels in the atmosphere and the Earth. The researchers tested their so-called ‘simple’ model and its global warming predictions against the complex models used by climate scientists. In particular, those complex models involved in the UN and World Meteorological Organisation’s (WMO) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. They also compared their predictions against real-world temperature changes. The paper claims that the measured, real-world rate of global warming over the past 25 years, equivalent to less than 1.4° C per century, is ‘half the IPCC's central prediction in 1990.’ In 1990, the UN's climate panel predicted with ‘substantial confidence’ that the world would warm at twice the rate that has been observed since. According to the study, another error made by the complex climate models, include the assumption that ‘temperature feedbacks’ would double or triple direct manmade greenhouse warming. The simple model instead found that feedbacks could reduce warming. Also, modellers are said to have failed to cut their estimate of global warming in line with a new, lower feedback estimate from the IPCC. Predictions of global temperature were extrapolated from January 1990 to October 2014 (shaded region). This was compared with observed anomalies (dark blue) and temperature trends (bright blue). ‘[Climate scientists] still predict 3.3°C of warming per CO2 doubling. They should only be predicting 2.2°C,' said the researchers . In 1990, the UN's climate panel predicted with ‘substantial confidence’ that the world would warm at twice the rate that has been observed since. Last year's report found that, by the end of the century, the emission of greenhouse gases will bring temperatures that are about 3.7°C (6.7°F) warmer . ‘They still predict 3.3°C of warming per CO2 doubling, when on this ground alone they should only be predicting 2.2°C - about half from direct warming and half from feedbacks,’ said the researchers. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report was published in November. It said continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes. This will increase the likelihood of 'severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.' Such impacts include extreme weather and rising sea levels, heat waves, flooding and droughts. Ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life. Without changes in emissions, 'climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century.' At the current rate, by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 2°C (3.6°F) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005. By the end of the century, that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7°C (6.7°F) warmer. The impact on the Earth could already be considered dangerous, the report claimed. ‘Though the complex models say there is 0.6°C manmade warming ""in the pipeline"" even if we stop emitting greenhouse gases, the simple model - confirmed by almost two decades without any significant global warming - shows there is no committed but unrealised manmade warming still to come.’ Once these errors are corrected, the researchers predict that the most likely global warming in response to a doubling of CO2 is not 3.3°C, but 1°C or less. And, even if all available fossil fuels were burned, less than 2.2°C warming would result, they claim. Author Dr Willie Soon, an solar physicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, said: ‘Our work suggests that man's influence on climate may have been much overstated. ‘The role of the sun has been undervalued. Our model helps to present a more balanced view.’ ‘A high-school student with a pocket scientific calculator can now use this model and obtain credible estimates of global warming simply and quickly, as well as acquiring a better understanding of how climate sensitivity is determined,’ added statistician and co-author Dr Matt Briggs. ‘As a statistician, I know the value of keeping things simple and the dangers in thinking that more complex models are necessarily better. ‘Once people can understand how climate sensitivity is determined, they will realise how little evidence for alarm there is.’ While Lord Monckton said: 'Our irreducibly simple climate model does not replace more complex models, but it does expose major errors and exaggerations in those models. ‘For instance, take away the erroneous assumption that strongly net-positive feedback triples the rate of manmade global warming and the imagined climate crisis vanishes.’ MailOnline has contacted the IPCC for comment.","Researchers claim global warming predictions are 'greatly exaggerated'

"The 30-year-old mother who tricked her entire community into believing her 5-year-old daughter had cancer has been spared jail today by an Iowa judge. Leatha Slauson, who cashed in more than $1,000 in donations for her child in August, has instead been ordered to spend five-years on probation in lieu of a sentence of two five-year jail terms. Slauson had faced up to 21 years in prison. District Court Judge Kathleen Kilnoski also ordered a tearful Slauson that she have no contact with her five children after she shaved her daughter Riley's head, medicated her with cannabis oil to bring on lethargy and even convinced her husband his child was dying. However, before she was let free on probation, the Atlantic mother pleaded to be allowed to see her children. Scroll down for video . Tears: Leatha Slauson pleaded with the judge in Iowa not to take her away from her children - but he declined and called her actions 'repugnent' Punishment: Leatha Slauson is allowed to walk free today in Atlantic, Iowa, but will not see her children for another five years . 'I'm so sorry it got this far. I never meant to hurt anyone,' said Slauson on the stand. 'I can most likely lose custody of my five beautiful babies. That is the worst punishment of all,' said Slauson to the court according to WOWT.Com. The judge made it clear if the disgraced mother violates any terms of probation, including seeing her children she would be thrown in jail for five years. Slauson can only see her children if they request it by their therapist, and then only if the visit is supervised by a psychologist. A psychiatrist told the court on Tuesday that he had diagnosed Slauson to be mentally ill, but said he couldn't determine exactly what. The judge told Slauson, 'The nature of these offense are huge. Any time a person commits a crime against a child it is abhorrent. But when the person committing that crime is also the person's parent it is even more repugnant.' Leatha Kaye Slauson of Atlantic, Iowa was arrested in August after local authorities discovered her 5-year-old daughter Riley wasn't actually dying of colorectal cancer. In November, Slauson pleaded guilty to two counts of child endangerment, one of administering harmful substances, one of theft and one of unlawful possession of a prescription drug. Con: Leatha Kaye Slauson (left) convinced her family and local community that her 5-year-old daughter Riley (right) was dying of cancer. Local authorities discovered Riley was not suffering from any terminal illness . The 30-year-old mother-of-five started spreading the lie back in September 2013, shaving little Riley's head and even medicating her with unnecessary cannabis oil. The local community rallied around the Riley, raising money and even paying for the family's trip to Walt Disney World. Drugs: Slauson has also been charged for medicating Riley with unnecessary cannabis oil. She posted this picture of the little girl sucking on an oral syringe to Facebook. Oral syringes are commonly used to dispense cannabis oil . The ruse was brought to light last week when administrators at Riley's school started looking into what special care she might need and realized inconsistencies with the mother's story. Slauson first started the story in fall 2013, and even went on television in the spring to talk about her daughter's so-called bucket list. Firefighter-obsessed Riley was brought into the local station to ride around in a fire truck for a day, and her mother talked to local reporters about her daughter's 'illness'. '(The cancer) is just spreading too fast,' Slauson told KETV back in April. 'It spread to her liver and the last MRI (showed) it spread to her lymph nodes and they stopped chemotherapy.' It also appears Slauson medicated Riley with unnecessary cannabis oil, and even posted a picture of the girl on her Facebook, sucking at an oral syringe commonly used to dispense the drug. The little girl subsequently tested positive for THC. Local authorities held a press conference after Slauson's arrest and said it appears she was the only person involved in the crime, saying her husband and four other children were convinced of the ruse as well. They wouldn't say the total funds Slauson conned from the community, but it's thought to be over $1,000. Following Slauson's arrest, Riley and her four other children are being cared for by their father. Cass County Attorney Dan Gesitner says the father is 'struggling with how to proceed in his life'.

"By SALLY JONES FOR THE DAILY MAIL . The call came while I was sitting in my daughter’s Oxford study. ‘Congratulations. I’m delighted to tell you that you’ve been selected to appear on Mastermind,’ said the producer. ‘We’ll be in touch soon to finalise dates and your specialist subjects.’ My stomach turned over with a familiar pang — half-excitement, half-terror at the thought of my fourth appearance on the cult show. Why do I keep putting myself through this? It must be the dangerous thrill of that Approaching Menace theme tune, the black leather chair, the blinding spotlights that induce brain‑numbing panic and John Humphrys, trying unsuccessfully to sound avuncular. ‘And is your daughter, Madeline, there?’ asked the voice. ‘I need to speak to her, too.’ Madeline, 21, listened intently for a second and then squealed in delight and hugged me. Mastermind had always been a cult show in our house and now she had got the call, too — one of the youngest ever contestants, one of just a handful of female quizzers and part of the first ever ‘family double’ of mother and daughter competing in the same season. Days earlier she had been gutted to miss out on University Challenge. She and her brother, Roly, were each picked for their college teams, Madeline captaining St Hilda’s, Oxford, and Roly, 22, reserve for Caius, Cambridge. But neither appeared in the televised version as the colleges were whittled down to just a handful of uber-geeks. As a BBC Breakfast sports presenter, I had worked alongside Jeremy Paxman in the Eighties. During the University Challenge qualifier, he joked with my children that he chiefly remembered me for mangling the word ‘dioceses’. I resisted the temptation to tell them what I chiefly remembered him for! Both had always loved quizzes and, aged ten, Roly even reached the final of Britain’s Brainiest Kid, presented by a young Tess Daly. ‘She’s very pretty’ he confided afterwards, ‘but she couldn’t even pronounce Jerusalem!’ Madeline’s alma mater, King Edward VI High School for Girls in Birmingham, has a strong quiz tradition. Aged 13, she was in the Schools Challenge side that reached the national finals. Maybe it’s in the genes. During childbirth, I deadened the pain of contractions with an epidural and played Trivial Pursuit with my husband, John, for hours. He now claims he let me win. As if! Over the years I’ve appeared on Krypton Factor, Crosswits, Fifteen to One and a host of pub quizzes and charity events. During a lucrative outing, aged 18, on Sale Of The Century, which paid for several weeks of tennis tournaments, I became flustered when asked to spell ‘pseudonym’ and blurted out: ‘P-s-u-e-d . . . no, that’s not it . . . p-s-u-e-d . . . oh, bugger it!’ Nicholas Parsons, with ineffable condescension (and the answer on a card in front of him) intoned: ‘Sally, when you get to Oxford, take a dictionary and you will see that it’s spelt p-s-e-u-d-o-n-y-m.’ Mastermind, however, remains the single most nerve-wracking experience of my life. Quizzing is fractionally more male-dominated and gladiatorial than professional rugby league and populated by anoraks with halitosis and low-level jobs, maybe because they spend every spare minute hoovering up obscure facts in order to clean up at pub quizzes. Any woman who admits to the same perverse taste for memorising trivia, from U.S. state capitals to Monopoly board squares, in order, is treated with pitying contempt — or, if she wins, outright aggression. Drawn by a curious masochism, I first entered Mastermind in 2009 and squeaked through the first round — specialist subject: Saki’s short stories — narrowly beating three (delightful and supportive) blokes with immaculate personal hygiene, only to find a hostile taunt on my Wikipedia entry. ‘Despite being “a so-called sports journalist”, she failed to recall that Phil Vickery captained England in the 2007 World Cup. Pathetic!’ I bowed out in the semi‑final to the eventual (female) winner. Never imagining I would get through the first round, I had thoughtlessly picked tennis star and feminist campaigner Billie-Jean King as my specialist subject, a horribly broad topic as her career lasted several decades. Why hadn’t I chosen Maureen ‘Little Mo’ Connolly who won her first three Wimbledons in the Fifties then retired, aged 18, after smashing her leg in a riding accident? This time — for an episode to be aired tomorrow — I chose John Betjeman’s poetry (it’s entertaining and easily memorable), and selected a sparkly frock but manageable heels: the polished Mastermind walkway is narrow and slippery. Madeline and I tested each other to distraction, memorising lists of British Prime Ministers, flags of the world, Booker Prize winners and African capitals. We arrived at the Manchester studios — she excited, me numb with terror. Of course, nothing we’d memorised cropped up in the all-important general knowledge questions — though Betjeman’s ‘usual suspects’ Miss Joan Hunter Dunn and Pam the ‘great big mountainous sports girl’ were there. And how did we do? You'll just have to tune in to find out. SALLY’S DAUGHTER MADELINE SAYS: . I’ve wanted to go on University Challenge for as long as I can remember. So when my college team failed to make it past the heats, I was naturally disappointed. Sensing mediocrity, my ever-pushy mother nagged until I agreed to fill out an application to go on Mastermind — the Robin to University Challenge’s Batman. Some parents seem determined their children will go to a particular school or become a rocket scientist, but in our family it’s all about quizzes. She even entered herself, presumably for moral support. Sally and Madeline will both be seen on our TV screens soon in the infamous Mastermind chair . I was invited to London for an interview and to answer a few general knowledge questions. I assumed it was a lost cause, thanks to the football question I’d undoubtedly got wrong (pretty sure Arsenal don’t play at Stamford Bridge), and I kicked myself for forgetting the word ‘quango’ under pressure. Still, no doubt the BBC had gender diversity quotas to fill — I got on to the show. Sadly, the top two possible specialist topics I’d hoped to do, Harry Potter and Jane Austen, had been chosen in recent years, which was a huge disappointment. As a child, I read and re-read the Harry Potter books while the other children went to birthday parties. As for Jane Austen, I just wanted an excuse to revisit Colin Firth in a wet T-shirt. In the end, I opted for the novels of E. M. Forster and spent weeks mugging up, though I kept avoiding his longest, most complicated work, A Passage To India. I then had to read and learn the entire book the day before filming. On the day itself, I opted for a loose, white polka-dot shirt and jeans. Mum nagged me to wear something smarter, but I was dressing for comfort. My grandma and best friend, Eliza, came along for support and tested us both as we drove to the BBC studios in Salford. We were fitted with microphones and herded into the main studio, which was awash with cameramen, lighting technicians and spectators. When John Humphrys appeared, the lights dimmed and the quizzing began. Watching other contestants before me was the worst bit. I was so nervous when the guy in front of me finished that I started walking to The Chair before my name was called. Cue laughter from John Humphrys and the audience, and an embarrassing re-take. On my way back, the mic fell out of my jeans, and had to be refitted in front of everyone. But when I got in The Chair, something marvellous happened. I found that the mic incident, while mortifying, had released a lot of tension, and I felt almost relaxed. Both sets of questions went surprisingly well. The other contestants answered on The Battle of the Somme, the band Joy Division and The Big Bang Theory (the TV show, not the beginning of the universe). I got lucky with what felt like the easiest general knowledge questions, but still managed to give an unbelievably thick answer to a question about jewellery. When we finished, John Humphrys strode off before I got a chance to speak to (i.e. take a selfie with) him. Will I get another opportunity? That’s one question I can’t answer just yet... Sally Jones will appear on Mastermind on BBC2 tomorrow at 8pm; Madeline’s appearance is on Friday, February 6, at 8pm.","They are the mother and daughter duo who will both be victim to John Humphrey's question on the popular quiz .

"He apparently had surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle, so perhaps Kim Jong-un was searching for more comfortable footwear. Or maybe he was picking out a colourful pair of heels for his good lady. Whatever the reason for his latest 'field guidance' visit, the North Korean leader was paying very close attention at a shoe factory this week. Accompanied by his usual phalanx of staff who were furiously taking notes, Kim surveyed a vast array of footwear from baby wellington boots to bright-yellow sandals. Suits you, sir! Kim Jong Un surveys a vast array of footwear on a visit to the Ryuwon Shoes Factory in the capital Pyongyang for his latest 'field guidance' visit . Close inspection: Kim Jong Un studies what appear to be the soles of football boots with factory bosses . Pictures released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency today show him scouring rows of shoes, stopping at times to discuss different styles. He is later seen waving to a crowd of workers outside the Ryuwon Shoes Factory in the capital Pyongyang. A foot condition was last year mooted as a possible reason for his mystery six-week public absence. A South Korean spy agency claimed the North Korean leader was having a cyst removed from his ankle. Footwear for the little Un? The North Korean leader  inspects some child's wellington boots . A foot condition was last year mooted as a possible reason for his mystery six-week public absence after a South Korean spy agency claimed the North Korean leader was having a cyst removed from his ankle . Kim disappeared on September 3, leading to a frenzy of wild speculation - including suggestions he had been overthrown, had died of a heart attack, was suffering a mental breakdown or was having a gastric band fitted to help him overcome a crippling addiction to Emmental cheese. He reappeared in public on October 14 looking slightly slimmer and walking with the aid of a cane. Kim's visit to the shoe factory came as Russia said it had received a positive initial signal from North Korea after President Vladimir Putin invited its leader Kim Jong Un to attend anniversary celebrations of the Soviet victory over Germany in World War Two. The trip would be Kim's first foreign visit since taking the helm of the reclusive east Asian state in 2011. Are these good for r-Unning? Kim discusses a pair of trainers while his officials furiously takes notes . Kim's visit to the shoe factory came as Russia said it was confident the North Korea leader would attend the anniversary celebrations of the Soviet victory over Germany in World War Two . Moscow and Pyongyang are looking to boost ties and North Korea is seeking support from Russia against international criticism over accusations of human rights abuses. Asked at a news conference on Wednesday about Pyongyang's response to the Russian invitation, Lavrov replied: 'The first signal was positive'. He did not elaborate. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last month that Kim had been invited to the World War Two victory anniversary which Russia marks every year on May 9. The U.N. General Assembly committee dealing with human rights passed a resolution last month calling for the Security Council to consider referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity. Kim waves to a crowd of workers outside the Ryuwon Shoes Factory in the capital Pyongyang . Russia, as a permanent veto-wielding member of the Security Council, has the power to strike down any such move. Moscow also needs Pyongyang co-operation in boosting natural gas exports to South Korea as Gazprom wants to build a gas pipeline through North Korea to reach its southern neighbour. Lavrov has previously said North Korea is ready to resume stalled international talks on its nuclear programme. North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia and the United States began talks in 2003 to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons, but they were suspended after Pyongyang tested nuclear devices in 2006 and 2009.",NK leader inspects footwear from baby wellies to bright-yellow sandals .
"The debate over the legalisation of marijuana continues to rage in the US... but it seems a more pressing issue concerns the safety of milk. More Americans support a ban on the sale of unpasteurized milk than they do a ban on the sale of marijuana, according to a survey. While 46 per cent of those surveyed wanted to outlaw the drug, 59 per cent were against the sale of raw milk. Unpasteurized milk has become trendy among celebrity food writers and other advocates of unprocessed ‘raw food’, who claim it is both tastier and healthier. More Americans support a ban on the sale of unpasteurized milk than they do a ban on the sale of marijuana, according to a survey (file photos) They also claim raw milk is associated with reduced levels of asthma, hay fever and food allergies in children. Untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste . Marijuana, one of the most commonly used drugs in the world, has been legalized in multiple states and many argue that it serves medical benefits that can relieve pain and combat anxiety. Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize the possession and use of recreational marijuana by adults in 2012. In the results of the Oklahoma State University's monthly food survey of at least 1,000 people, Americans showed even more support for policies that would require country-of-origin labels for meat and lower calorie school lunches . Though both have been up-and-coming in recent years, both have dangerous elements. Microorganisms in raw milk can cause serious health risks, including salmonella, E. coli and listeria. Any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may contain these bugs. Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment. All fresh milk sold in the high street is pasteurised – heated to 72C (162F) for 25 seconds, which kills bacteria. As for marijuana, many believe it is a gateway drug that can lead users to more serious substance abuse. Some believe it has permanent affects on the brain. In the results of the Oklahoma State University monthly online survey of at least 1,000 people, Americans showed even more support for policies that would require country-of-origin labels for meat and lower calorie school lunches. Eighty per cent said they supported policies that would require foods containing DNA to have labels - that includes all fruits, vegetables and meats. Almost the same amount of people said genetically modified foods should require labels while nearly 70 per cent said restaurant menus should require calorie counts.","Sixty per cent of Americans support bans on the sale of raw milk, Oklahoma State University's Food Demand Survey shows .

"Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan has written a letter to his younger self, warning of the poor decisions that would lead him to end up in jail for drug smuggling and imploring Australian kids not to follow his mistakes. The six-page letter was written by Chan, who is scheduled to be executed by firing squad this year, was penned from inside his Bali cell in Kerobokan Prison, where he has spent almost a decade dwelling on the actions that brought him there. In the letter, which features in the new documentary 'Dear Me: The Dangers of Drugs', Chan asks young Australians to question themselves before they make any potential life-altering decisions. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine ringleader has penned a letter to his 15-year-old self to warn young Australians off drugs . 'I don’t know what choices you guys are making, however, if anything, I would want you guys to remember is, ‘Is it worth it?’,' Chan says in the film. 'You are still young and you have some serious decisions to make in your life. What you choose today will make what you become tomorrow. If you want to be a thug and a big bad wolf, I’ll see you soon inside,' reported The Herald Sun. Arrested at 21 for his role in the Bali Nine drug smuggling ring, Chan has had many years 'to look at himself and he is reformed,' said the documentary's maker, Malinda Rutter. Chan has reportedly turned his life around, becoming a leader at the prison and running bible studies and mentoring other prisoners. 'For those that want to do something in life, I’d like you guys to see how important it is to put your head down and study hard.' In the documentary, Chan addresses his 15-year-old self in the hope that the young Australians the film is aimed at will see how stark his future may be. 'Dear me, when you are older you will be in a Bali prison and you will be executed,' Chan says. 'This happened to you because you thought taking drugs was cool.' Chan was arrested at the age of 21 for his role in the Bali Nine drug smuggling ring . Chan and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006 . In the film, Chan explains that he became involved with drugs at an early age, and by the time he was 15, was heavily using the substances that would eventually lead him to jail. 'Your drug taking made you think it was ok to import drugs and make money from this. Your family and friends are heartbroken and your life will be ended by firing squad'. 'Really, underneath you are not a bad person, and drugs made you different,' Chan ends. He says in the film that he has made some bad decisions, and is not proud for many of his actions. Chan and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006, and could face death as early as next Sunday under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. The Australians may only be given several days notice if scheduled for execution, facing the imminent possibility of their death following the recent increase in criminal executions after a five year respite. Despite Indonesian President Joko Widodo vowing not to grant pardons for drug smugglers, the attorney-general's spokesman, Tony Spontana, said that there was a chance for the executions to be delayed. 'But with regards to death penalty, we have the mechanism to review the decision,' Mr Spontana said. 'Starting from the decision made by the District Court all the way to decision in Judicial Review, including the clemency decision,' reported The ABC. Sukamaran has been in the same Bali jail as Chan for nearly a decade . Mr McMahon, their Australian lawyer, said that the pair had made significant efforts to improve their lives and the lives of others in the Indonesian prison system . Mr Abbott (with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, left) said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution . If Chan and Sukumaran are executed under the same conditions that previous inmates have faced, they will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled. The pair will be offered blindfolds to wear, and will have white aprons around their neck and a red target on their chest. Sukamaran's mercy plea was rejected by the Indonesian government on December 30th, while Chan's plea is yet to be finalised. Their fate rests heavily on Chan's clemency bid, as the pair have been informed that they will face execution together for their plot to smuggle over 8 kilograms of heroin into Australia. Julian McMahon, the pair's Australian lawyer, said that executions were 'not clean killings', and that prisoners may be tied to a plank before being shot. 'If the prisoner isn’t dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head,' Mr McMahon said. Mr McMahon said that Sukamaran and Chan were traumatised by their impending execution, and often dreamed of being shot in the heart by the prison's firing squad. Sukamaran's mercy plea was rejected by the Indonesian government on December 30th, while Chan's plea is yet to be finalised . Chan could face death as early as next Sunday under a crackdown by the government on drug cases . Sukamaran and Chan attended school together at Homebush Boys High School in Sydney's west, and Chan said the pair had been relying on each other in an attempt to 'trying to stay strong for our family and friends at this difficult time.' 'It is hard to think that our lives are in the hands of two men - Tony Abbott and Joko Widodo - who have the power to grant life and death - please pray for a change of heart for these men and for our families,' he wrote in comments passed onto the Facebook page Friends of Andrew Chan. Mr McMahon labelled the potential executions 'chilling', and said that he could not fathom simply taking prisoners outside and shooting them. 'It seemed impossible to be true that they would take out these people on the weekend and just shoot them. That was my first reaction,' Mr McMahon said. News of the looming executions has galvanised Australians seeking clemency for Chan and Sukumaran, with 2,500 signatures on a petition begging Indonesian president Joko Widodo for mercy on their behalf. Mr Abbott said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution, but admitted he would not risk jeopardising diplomatic relations.","Bali Nine Andrew Chan has written a five page letter to his 15-year-old self .

"Sky’s customers will now be forced to ‘opt in’ if they want to access adult material – protecting children from stumbling across hardcore images and videos . Sky has pledged to impose an automatic block on pornographic websites in a major victory for online safety campaigners and the Daily Mail. Under the move, a family-friendly filter will be set by default unless customers specifically ask for it to be removed. Sky’s five million clients will now be forced to ‘opt in’ if they want to access adult material – protecting children from stumbling across hardcore images and videos. New broadband users will have the blocker installed already. Sky becomes the first major company to take the step, which was welcomed by child safety experts last night. But pressure is now mounting on other major internet providers such as BT – which has twice as many broadband customers as Sky – and Virgin Media to adopt the same ‘family-friendly’ approach. At present, these companies give customers the option of a filter – but do not impose one automatically. The Daily Mail has campaigned for an automatic block on online porn to protect children, with the over-18s forced to undergo a strict age verification check before they can access adult material. In 2013, David Cameron warned that easy access to web porn was ‘corroding childhood’, and announced that he had reached agreement with internet firms to make it easier for worried parents to impose a filter. BT, Virgin, TalkTalk and Sky agreed to contact customers by the end of last year to present them with an on-screen choice about family-friendly filters. While campaigners welcomed the move, some were concerned it was too easy for families to ignore filters, putting children at risk of stumbling across hardcore imagery. Shield of protection: How the new system will work - new customers will have blocker installed automatically . Sky has now gone much further with an automatic filter known as Broadband Shield, which it calls a ‘family-friendly approach’ to using the internet. Starting this week, the company will email its 5million customers about the blocker. If households ignore the email and a subsequent reminder, their computer will automatically block pornography and other websites considered to be harmful to children. Director Lyssa McGowan said: ‘It’s better for people to make their own choice, but until they do, we believe this process will be the safest one.’ Many campaign groups supported the move last night. The company will email customers about the blocker - if they ignore the email and a subsequent reminder, their computer will automatically block pornography . John Carr, director of The UK Council for Child Internet Safety, said: ‘Sky has raised the bar and it will be interesting to see how the other companies react to this.’ Charities including the NSPCC, ChildNet International and the Churches’ Child Protection Advisory Service also praised the measure. But Jim Killock, of online freedom campaigners the Open Rights Group, said customers need to understand the implications of filters before deciding whether they want them. Ed Macnair, of online security firm CensorNet, said the blanket ban is not enough – parents also need to take responsibility for what children see on all devices. A spokesman for BT said it was sending existing broadband customers a browser message about setting up free parental controls. Virgin Media said its 4.5million customers are told of filters via marketing, but it remains off if they ignore it. A spokesman said: ‘We believe people should have the tools and advice to make the decisions that are right for them.’ TalkTalk, which has four million internet customers, also gives users a choice where the parental control filter is pre-selected as ‘on’. Ed Vaizey, minister for the digital economy, said: ‘This is exactly the sort of responsible approach we want internet service providers to take. Government will continue to work with ISPs to ensure we continue to help parents protect their children from harmful content online.’ Charities including the NSPCC and ChildNet International have all praised the new security measure .","Sky has introduced an automatic filter known as Broadband Shield .

'At about six or seven years old, I used to steal all my parents' toilet paper and wrap up my legs in toilet paper to mimic a cast.' Kevin was 12 when he wore his first real cast, after breaking his arm in a rollerblading accident, and became fascinated with the attention it brought him. 'I absolutely love the attention I get,' he said. 'I use crutches, I use a scooter, I use a wheelchair, whatever it takes.'

'There isn't a day that goes by that I don't talk to a psychic. I talk to up to three a day. Seeing a psychic can calm me down, can make me feel happy, or give me some peace of mind,' she says. Melissa has spent $500,000 on her addiction, and turns to psychics for advice on everything from potential dates to kitchen appliances. She sometimes 'binges', calling up to ten psychics in one day to see if they all give the same answer. Even one of her psychics, Michelle, says Melissa's obsession is excessive, explaining: 'People like Melissa really do abuse the whole purpose of going to a psychic.

'What I love about drinking air freshener is the taste,' she reveals. 'In the last three years, there's not a day that I've not had it.' Evelyn discovered the habit by accident, when an automatic air freshener sprayed the rim of her glass as she was walking by. 'It was a flavor that I liked,' she recalls. Evelyn goes through 20 cans of air freshener a week, which is comparable to what an average hotel uses. Her fiance, Ricky, doesn't understand her obsession, but enables her anyway, buying her fresh cans. Ricky says he sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night and catches her spraying it in her mouth. He even lets her spray it in his own mouth. 'It's nasty, it's disgusting, but she loves it and I love her, so therefore I just have to deal with it.'

"They have both built their careers around their looks and have long-favoured fake tan, false eyelashes and full lips. But Katie Price and Alicia Douvall, who both speak openly about their exhaustive list of cosmetic procedures, have swapped their cherished beauty products for a bare-faced look in the Celebrity Big Brother house. With nowhere to hide thanks to cameras operating 24/7 in every room, both women's au-natural looks are on display for all to see. Scroll down for video . Celebrity Big Brother stars and cosmetic fans Katie Price, pictured, and Alicia Douvall have been going bare-faced in the house... so who looks better without the slap? But both women have had more than little help to boost their beauty. Katie, 36, had her first breast augmentation when she was 18 and, since then, has had a series of operations that have left her with the C chest she has today. On top of that, she opted for two nose jobs, hair extensions, Botox and veneers. And while she may have shot to fame as the UK's most famous glamour model with a penchant for fake tan, peroxide hair extensions and heavy eye make-up, the star recently told FEMAIL she's left those days long behind her. Bare-faced Alicia Douvall has had surgery to shave her ribs in order to reduce the size of her waist, and even surgery to break her toes so that they fit into her designer shoes . Katie, pictured, left, in the house bare-faced, and, right, at an event last year with full make-up, has had two nose jobs, hair extensions, Botox and veneers . The mother-of-four maintains that she's so disinterested in beautifying herself - apart from for public appearances - that the only thing in her make-up bag is a tub of Vaseline. The model and entrepreneur said: 'The older you get, the less interested in make-up you are. A smokey eye is ageing and with four kids, the last thing on my mind is make-up. 'In fact, I don't wear any. Vaseline is the only thing in my make-up bag to keep my lips moisturised.' She did, however, admit that she swears by four beauty treatments that she's been having since her final years of school.

'I have my eyelashes and eyebrows tinted every week. I think good brows are really important and I love having a matching manicure and pedicure. I've had the same girl doing it for six years,' she said. Which CBB star do you think looks worse without make-up? Which CBB star do you think looks worse without make-up? Now share your opinion . Alicia, meanwhile, has had a staggering 18 operations to enhance her breasts - the first when she was 17. The glamour model, also 36, has apparently had more than 350 procedures since then to enhance her looks. One of her most dramatic procedures was one to shave her ribs in order to reduce her waist, and even surgery to break her toes so that they fit into her designer shoes. Speaking to the Independent in 2009, Alicia admitted that she was 'addicted' to surgery. 'I've had so many operations that I can't feel my stomach, my left breast, or anything under my right arm,' she said. 'I've had 15 boob jobs. I've changed my eyes and nose, had facelifts. 'My philosophy is, ""if it can be changed, it will be"". It's got to the stage where doctors in Britain refuse to treat me any more, so I've been flying to the US for surgery and lying about my medical history.' Alicia - real name born Sarah Howes - was diagnosed with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), a condition whereby sufferers are obsessed and paranoid about their appearance. Alicia has been to rehab three times. Alicia, 36, pictured bare-faced on the reality TV show, has apparently had 350 surgical procedures . Alicia Douvall, pictured, left, make-up free in the house, and, right, with a full face of cosmetics on entering, has had a staggering 18 operations to enhance her breasts and more than 350 procedures . Alicia has been sharing details of her procedures live on TV. Admitting they used 'pig skin' to give her breast tissue, the mother told Katie Hopkins and Michelle Visage, 'I’d rather be dead than not have t*ts…I could not live without t*ts.' Michelle tries to reassure her that 'being a woman comes from within' and admits she can’t wait to have her implants taken out after having three boob jobs herself. The topic of discussion came up after Alicia asked Katie Hopkins if she would ever have a boob job if she was offered one for free. Katie admits 'it would be quite nice to have some boobs', before complimenting Alicia and Michelle on theirs. Alicia admits that she was flat chested before she had 18 boob jobs. Alicia adds, 'The brutal truth is, looks do matter'.

"These spectacular photographs show five trucks abandoned in 1943 that have rusted so severely they now blend in with their natural surroundings. The selection of old vehicles - parked in a row next to each other - have not moved in 73 years and their corrosion is now so advanced the old motors appear camouflaged in front of the green, orange and yellow backdrop. The vehicles were involved in the building of the Canol Road - the 'Canadian American Norman Oil Line' - in the Yukon Territory in Canada. Scroll down for video .

'The owners of the trucks would have been the Canadian and American military and they were abandoned after the road was completed. 'I noticed the trucks had started to blend in with their surroundings which was the reason for my taking the photographs.

"With more than a $10 billion to her name, it's little surprise that Steve Jobs' businesswoman widow likes to treat herself. Laurene Powell, 51, was spotted grinning after a shopping trip in St. Barts with her new beau, ex-Washington D.C. mayor Adrian Fenty, during their Caribbean vacation on Tuesday evening. Fenty, 44, carried shopping bags as he followed his girlfriend to a boat at the dock, presumably to return to their yacht, where they were seen sunning themselves earlier this week. The happy duo looked at ease as they walked together along the dock before being helped into the small boat, where they sat close to each other. Day out: Laurene Powell, 51, and Adrian Fenty, 44, were seen on shore during their Caribbean vacation on Tuesday night after an apparent shopping trip. The couple have been on a Cayman Island yacht this week . All smiles: The couple, who started dating nearly two years ago, looked at ease as they headed to their boat . The couple was first rumored to be dating in the summer of 2013 but these are among the first photos of their budding romance. Powell was left widowed after Apple founder Steve Jobs passed away, aged 56, from complications from pancreatic cancer in October 2011. They had three children together and Powell is also step-mother to Jobs' daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs. Fenty, mayor of Washington D.C. between 2007 and 2011, formally announced his separation from his wife of 15 years, Michelle, in January 2013. They also have three children together. Sources told the Washington Post that summer that Fenty and Powell started seeing each other around the same time, but there is no suggestion that Powell had anything to do with the separation. It is believed the two met at a Houston education conference in 2011 and bonded over school reform; Powell is the founder of Emerson Collective, which advocates for education reform, among others, while Fenty's focus during his mayorship with education. Watchful: Fenty, who stepped down as DC mayor in 2011, watched as his girlfriend climbed into the boat . Night out: The couple, who first met in 2011, settled into the boat before heading back to their yacht . Close: Fenty, 44, got close to his businesswoman and philanthropist girlfriend, 51, in the boat . Alone time: The couple has six children and one step-child among them from their previous marriages . The following year, Fenty joined the board of College Track, a non-profit program for underserved students wanting to go to college that was co-founded by Powell. 'Adrian Fenty is one of our country's great advocates for education reform,' she said in a statement at the time. 'His sense of urgency and record of accomplishment is unparalleled.' The pair were first friends, sources told the Washington Post, before they started dating at the start of 2013. In June 2014, the couple was pictured at a French open match together. Powell had married Jobs two years after meeting him when he gave a talk to Stanford Business School while she was a student there. Former flames: Powell is pictured left with her husband, Apple founder Steve Jobs, who passed away in October 2011. Right, Fenty and his wife Michelle are pictured together in 2010, three years before their split . Their wedding took place in March 1991 at a hotel in Yosemite Valley, and the ceremony was led by a Zen Buddhist monk, Kobun Chino Otogawa, in keeping with Jobs' religious beliefs. Their eldest child, a son named Reed, was born six months later, and the couple had two daughters, Erin and Eve, in the years following. While she was on the boards of several companies and charities during his lifetime, it was only after he died that she began to speak publicly to draw attention to the causes that mattered to her. They were married for 20 years and after his death, she inherited an estate of about $10 billion. Despite being one of the richest women in the U.S. she has kept a deliberately low profile as she continues with her charitable work. Since Fenty left the mayor's office, he has focused on acting as a consultant to education tech companies and working as a special adviser at Andreessen Horowitz.","Powell, 51, and Fenty, 44, were seen laughing on shore on Tuesday night during their Caribbean vacation on the island of St Barts .

"A sickly stray cat that was taken in by a family in Canada is set to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Mittens was adopted by Colleen Clarke-Murphy and her family,who live in Heart's Desire, Newfoundland, and when they took the cat to a veterinarian in October they for quite the surprise when they found out the cat was a hermaphrodite. And since Clarke-Murphy already had a male cat, and Mittens has both genitalia, she decided she wanted a female cat. Scroll down for video . Mittens (above) will be the first cat to undergo gender reassignment surgery . The cat is a hermaphrodite with both genitalia, and while new owner Colleen Clarke-Murphy (above) was hoping for a girl, they advised it would be best for Mittens to become a boy . 'Did I just hear you right?' asked Clarke-Murphy to the vet after she was told the news. She got another surprise soon after, when she learned the female cat she wanted was not in the animal's best interest according to her vet, and they would make the cat male. 'They're the ones who know what they're doing' Clarke-Murphy told CBC News. 'I mean, I really don't know. I'd like for it to be a female, but it really don't matter. It's got both parts.' 'I think it's got both personalities, so it really don't matter.' So then it was decided the cat would be spayed, neutered, and have reconstructive surgery. The cost? $1500. Money is not an object to Clarke-Murphy however when it comes to Mittens. Mittens will now be spayed and neutered and then have reconstructive surgery . 'She was part of my family when she came home with my daughter,' she said. What's more, there are problems that come with the cat's current situation as it has bowel issues and problems urinating. Now, a friend of Clarke-Murphy is auctioning off some items on Facebook to help pay the vet bill.","Mittens, a stray cat taken in by a family in Heart's Desire, Newfoundland, will undergo gender reassignment surgery .

"Britain is to become the second country in the world to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes. Laws forcing tobacco firms to sell products in standard packaging bearing only grisly health warnings will come into force next year, ministers said last night. Public health minister Jane Ellison told MPs they would have a free vote on the issue – expected to be approved by an overwhelming majority. The Government has been considering banning branding on packs for more than two years, following the example of Australia, the first country to introduce such laws. Scroll down for video . Britain is to become the second country in the world to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes, it has been announced. Laws forcing tobacco firms to sell products in standard packaging - bearing only grisly health warnings - will come into force next year . Right-wing Tory MPs have complained that it would be a ‘nanny state’ measure, while others insist the reform will lead to increased smuggling and job losses. Dozens are expected to vote against the measure, but it will pass through the Commons with the support of Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs. Medics insist that non-smokers – and younger people in particular – are likely to find plain packaging less appealing. Announcing the Government’s intention to hold a vote in the Commons before May’s General Election, Miss Ellison told MPs: ‘Smoking remains one of our most significant public health challenges. ‘Almost 80,000 people in England alone die every year from ill-health related to smoking. Most smokers start young and we want our children to grow up free from the burden of disease that tobacco brings. ‘Having considered all the evidence, I believe that the policy is a proportionate and justified response to the considerable public health harm from smoking tobacco. ‘The chief medical officer has confirmed this view. Jane Ellison (pictured) made the announcement at an evening adjournment debate in the Commons . 'I now propose that we lay regulations for standardised packaging in this Parliament to allow for them to come into force… in May 2016.’ Professor Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said: ‘I welcome the Government’s backing for this policy. ‘I have reviewed the evidence, and agree that standardised packaging would be a positive move for public health, particularly the role it could play in helping to prevent the uptake of smoking by children. ‘We need to keep up our efforts on tobacco control and standardised packaging is an important part of that.’ Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity ASH, said: ‘Every day hundreds of children start to smoke. 'Standard packs mean that the tobacco industry cannot use glitzy packaging to help addict the next generation. Standard packs are backed by the public… and health professionals.’ But Conservative MP Angela Watkinson said she would oppose the reform: ‘This policy is well-intentioned, but misguided. 'I believe it will do more harm than good.’ Christopher Snowdon, director of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘This is a gross infringement of the right of companies to use their trademarks and design their packaging. ‘There is no need to wonder what will happen next, we need only look at Australia – where the black market has grown and youth smoking has risen. 'To pursue this grandstanding policy in spite of the Australian experience is sheer negligence.’ Conservative MP Philip Davies said: ‘I’m afraid this is an idiotic decision which is a triumph for the nanny state. 'It is also completely pointless, given that cigarettes are behind the counter so you can’t now see the packets anyway. Public Health Minister Jane Ellison also revealed a ban on smoking in private cars will come into force from October (file picture) 'There will be a fair rebellion from my colleagues, which I would have thought the party could well do without just before an election.’ The issue of plain packaging has become a millstone for the Government, which has been accused of dragging its feet on the issue due to the influence of tobacco lobbyists, including chief Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby. Downing Street insists David Cameron has not been lobbied by Mr Crosby on the issue, whose lobbying company represents alcohol and tobacco firms in Australia but has not disclosed its UK clients. Cigarettes already have to be stored behind a screen in supermarkets, and similar rules will soon apply to small shops. MPs recently voted to make smoking in cars while children are present illegal. In December 2012, Australia became the first country in the world to insist all tobacco products are sold in standardised packs.","Britain to become second country in world to introduce plain packaging .

"The last remaining survivors of the infamous Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau are sharing their memories ahead of the 70th anniversary of its liberation. An estimated 1.1million people, most of them Jews, were killed at Hitler's most infamous death camp, located in occupied Poland, which later was to become a symbol of the horrors carried out during the Holocaust. The camp was liberated by Soviet Red Army troops on January 27, 1945 and about 200,000 camp inmates survived, with around 300 still alive today. Memories: Maria Stroinska, 82, pictured left and right holding a family photo taken before the war, was 12 during the Warsaw Uprising when she and her sister were sent from their house to a camp in Pruszkow before she was moved alone by train to Auschwitz-Birkenau . Prisoner no. 192705: Stefan Sot, 83, pictured left and right in a photo taken during the war, was 13-years-old during the Warsaw Uprising in August 1944, when he was sent from his home to a camp in Pruszkow prior to being sent by train to Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. He was later moved to a labour sub-camp, where he worked in a kitchen for S.S. officers. After the war he worked as a typesetter at a printing house . Survivor: Bogdan Bartnikowski, 82, holds a family photograph as he poses for a portrait in Warsaw. Mr Bartnikowski was 12-years-old during the Warsaw Uprising, when he and his mother were sent to Auschwitz Birkenau camp. They were moved between camps several times. After the war Mr Bartnikowski worked as a pilot and then became a journalist and writer . Inked with hate: Originally from Myszkow, north of Krakow, Marian Majerowicz, 88, was 17 when he was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. At the camp he was briefly reunited with his father, who told him that his mother and younger brother were both killed in the gas chambers. Mr Majerowicz's father didn't survive the war . Survivor Stefan Sot, 83, was one of many sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau during the Warsaw Uprising in August 1944. He was 13 when he and his family arrived. He was later moved to a labour sub-camp, where he worked in a kitchen for S.S. officers. After the war he worked as a typesetter at a printing house. Maria Stroinska, 82, was also sent out of Warsaw during the Uprising. She was 12 when she and her sister were sent from their house to a camp in Pruszkow before she was moved alone by train to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Many of those who survived have made it their mission to make sure that the horrors of the Holocaust will not be forgotten. Erzsebet Brodt, 89, was 17-years-old when she was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau along with her family. Remembering the journey to the camp she said that those who were 'sick or about to give birth were forced out and put into one wagon. When the wagon was opened in Auschwitz we saw that everyone was dead inside.' An estimated 1.1million people, most of them Jews, were killed at the Nazi camp which has became a symbol of the horrors of the Holocaust and World War Two. The camp was liberated by Soviet Red Army troops on January 27, 1945 and about 200,000 camp inmates survived. Lone survivor: Eva Fahidi, 90, holds a picture of her family, who were all killed in the concentration camp during World War Two, as she poses for a portrait in Budapest. Fahidi was 18 in 1944 when she and her family were moved from Debrecen to Auschwitz-Birkenau . Painful picture: Lajos Erdelyi, 87, holds a drawing made by a campmate as he poses for a portrait in Budapest. Mr Erdelyi was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau in May 1944 and was later moved to another camp. When he was freed he weighed under 30kg, but tried to walk home. He collapsed, and was taken to a hospital by a farmer . Auschwitz survivor Jadwiga Bogucka , 89, who was registered with camp number 86356, holds a picture of herself from 1944. During the Warsaw Uprising in August, 1944, when Bogucka was 19, she and her mother were sent from their house to a camp in Pruszkow and then moved on August 12, 1944 by train to Auschwitz-Birkenau. They were liberated by the Red Army on January 27, 1945 . Halina Brzozowska, 82, holds a picture of herself which was taken during the war in Warsaw, January 12. She was 12 during the Warsaw Uprising when her family were sent to a camp in Pruszkow. She and her 6-year-old sister were then moved to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Ms Brzozowska said that it was hard to say what had happened to them, that they were taken from their homes, family and lost their childhood. Never forget: Janos Forgacs, 87, holds a document as he poses for a portrait in Budapest. Mr Forgacs recalls that he was in a group transported to a camp in a cattle wagon, with the windows sealed with barbed wire. An military officer told them to hand over their belongings, telling them they would not need them anymore . Distant past: Janina Reklajtis, 80,  holds a photo of herself taken during the war as she poses for a portrait in Warsaw.  Ms Reklajtis was 12-years-old during the Warsaw Uprising when she and her mother were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. They were sent to a labour camp in Berlin in January 1945 and were kept there until they were liberated . Moving on: Barbara Doniecka, 80, was 12-years-old during the Warsaw Uprising when she was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau with her mother . Lost childhood: Elzbieta Sobczynska, 80,  holds her father's watch, which was kept by her brother while they were in the camp. During the Warsaw Uprising, when Mrs Sobczynska was 10-years-old, she was sent with her mother and brother from their home to a camp in Pruszkow and then moved by train to Auschwitz-Birkenau. There they were separated into blocks for woman, girls and boys. Sobczynska said that she was robbed of her childhood, and lost the chance to experience a different kind of life . Long walk: Henryk Duszyk, 80, was 10-years-old during the Warsaw Uprising in August, 1944. He was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau with his father, brother and stepmother. The family were separated and Duszyk only saw his father once more before he was killed at the camp. Duszyk, his brother and stepmother were kept at Auschwitz-Birkenau until the camp was liberate . Auschwitz was the site of one of the largest mass murders in history, with around 1.1million murdered in its grounds - including Jews, gypsies, Poles and the disabled. Located in southern Poland, Auschwitz initially served as a detention center for political prisoners, but it evolved into a network of camps where Jewish people and other perceived enemies of the Nazi state were exterminated, often in gas chambers, or used as slave labor. Some prisoners were also subjected to barbaric medical experiments led by Dr Josef Mengele, also known as The Angel Of Death, including 80-year-old Danuta Bogdaniuk-Bogucka, who was ten years old when she was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Jews were sent to Auschwitz from all over Europe, but a majority came from Poland and Hungary. Imre Varsanyi, 86, from Budapest, was 14 years old when he and his family arrived. He was the only member of his family to survive. After the war Varsanyi did not talk about Auschwitz for 60 years because he felt ashamed of having survived. Near the end of January 1945, Nazi camp commanders facing the Soviet army's rapid advance abandoned their plans to destroy Auschwitz, leaving dozens of barracks standing, and the twisted concrete-and-steel remains of gas chambers that were only half-destroyed by dynamite. They drove 60,000 prisoners on a death march that lasted weeks; almost a quarter died. Soldiers from the Soviet First Ukrainian Front fought their way to the gates of Auschwitz-Birkenau on 27 January, 1945 and found less than 6,000 prisoners still alive in the camp. Nearby, at the Monowitz slave labour camp they discovered 600 more, and at Auschwitz main camp a further 1,000. Around 300 people who endured the nightmare of Auschwitz will gather this month at the site, now a museum, to remember the dead and their own liberation. Angel of Death: Danuta Bogdaniuk-Bogucka, 80, was 10-years-old when she was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau camp with her mother. Mrs Bogdaniuk-Bogucka was part of Josef Mengele's experiments when she was in Auschwitz. After the war she met her mother again and they discovered they had both been at Ravensbruck camp at the same time, but they had not realised this . His father's son: Laszlo Bernath, 87, poses for a portrait in Budapest. Bernath credits his father being a practical man with his survival of Auschwitz. He was 15 when they were taken but his father told him to lie about his age so that they would not be separated. Even whilst in the camp, Bernath had no idea about the gas chambers . Victims of the Holocaust: Mr Bernath holds up a picture of his mother and sisters  who were all killed in the concentration camp . The lucky runaway: Jerzy Ulatowski, 83, was taken by train to Auschwitz-Birkenau when he was 13-years-old. In January 1945 he managed to escape with his family, as there was a lack of power in the barbed wire surrounding the camp . War and pain: Erzsebet Brodt, 89, left and right holding a picture of her family who all died in the camps, was 17-years-old when she was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau along with her family. Remembering the journey to the camp she said that those who were 'sick or about to give birth were forced out and put into one wagon. When the wagon was opened in Auschwitz we saw that everyone was dead inside.' Strength: Jacek Nadolny, 77, was seven during the Warsaw Uprising, when he was sent with his family to Auschwitz-Birkenau by train. In January 1945 the family was moved to a labour camp in Berlin . Those left behind: Mr Nadolny, 77 holds up a wartime photo of his family, as he poses for a portrait in Warsaw in January 2015 . Imre Varsanyi, 86, from Budapest, holds up a photo of fellow survivors during World War Two. Varsanyi was 14-years-old when he and his family were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. He was the only member of his family to survive. After the war Varsanyi did not talk about Auschwitz for 60 years because he felt ashamed of having survived .

"Prince Andrew was under growing pressure last night to testify on oath about his contacts with alleged underage ‘sex slave’ Virginia Roberts. She lodged fresh documents at a Florida court saying her lawyers had served an extraordinary letter on the Duke last week requesting he answer questions – but he ‘refused’ to accept it. Miss Roberts also issued a stinging attack on ‘false and hurtful’ denials of her claims made by Andrew in the tumultuous past three weeks. She claimed his police bodyguards left her alone with him the first time he had sex with her and that she was involved in an orgy with the prince and eight other young girls. Scroll down for video . Prince Andrew (pictured with Virginia Roberts in 2001) is under growing pressure to testify on oath about his contacts with alleged underage ‘sex slave’ Virginia Roberts . Miss Roberts’ lawyers sent Buckingham Palace a letter (above) requesting his ‘voluntary cooperation in answering question about his sexual interactions’ with her . Buckingham Palace has strenuously rejected claims the Duke had any ‘sexual contact or relationship’ with Miss Roberts. Last week, Miss Roberts’ lawyers sent by FedEx couriers an unprecedented letter addressed to ‘His Royal Highness The Duke of York’ at Buckingham Palace requesting his ‘voluntary cooperation in answering question about his sexual interactions’ with her. It is not known whether Prince Andrew is covered by legal immunity simply by being a royal because this has never been tested in international law. However, the prince may be entitled to diplomatic immunity against questioning in any criminal inquiry because some of the allegations relate to when he was a Whitehall-sanctioned business envoy. Diplomatic immunity protects foreign diplomats from legal action in the country where they work. Extradition lawyer Karen Todner said the prince could be formally asked to give evidence ‘only in criminal proceedings’. If he refused to co-operate, he could in theory be banned from entering America. The letter offered to interview the prince under oath ‘at a time and place of your choosing’. But her lawyers stated: ‘Federal Express has informed us that the letter has been refused by the recipient.’ The latest documents filed at Palm Beach court house in Florida make plain Miss Roberts’s determination to pursue the Prince – who she said ‘I just called “Andy”.’ She alleges she was a sex slave loaned out by paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein to his friend Andrew when she was aged 17 in 2001, claiming: ‘Whatever Prince Andrew wanted, I was to make sure he got.’ The latest bombshell came as a shock to Buckingham Palace officials last night as they arrived in Switzerland with Andrew to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos. The Prince, who is today due to give a much-anticipated speech to business leaders, was sitting down with his advisers when details of the papers began to drop last night. In her latest court salvo, Miss Roberts states: ‘I have seen Buckingham Palace’s recent “emphatic” denial that Prince Andrew had sexual contact with me. That denial is false and hurtful to me. I did have sexual contact with him as I have described…under oath. Virginia Roberts included this photo into today's court filing to show how young she was . Virginia Roberts included four photos of herself in the new court filing to illustrate her connection to the places in New Mexico mentioned in the court documents . The letter offered to interview the prince under oath ‘at a time and place of your choosing’. But her lawyers said the letter had been 'refused by the recipient' In new documents, Miss Roberts (left) launched a stinging attack on the Duke's (right) denials of her allegations. She claims they had sex when she was 17 . ‘Given what he knows and has seen, I was hoping that he would simply voluntarily tell the truth about everything. I hope my attorneys can interview Prince Andrew under oath about the contacts and that he will tell the truth.’ She said she had directed her lawyers ‘to pursue all reasonable and legitimate means to bring criminal charges against these powerful people for the crimes they have committed against me and other girls.’ She added: ‘If a judge wants me to present my information in more detail, including more specific descriptions of the sexual activities with the men Epstein sent me to, I could do so.’ She also denies having sex with former US President Bill Clinton. The letter served on Andrew was written by lawyer Jack Scarola, dated January 14, and included the now-notorious photo of the Prince posing next to Miss Roberts. He told the Prince: ‘This letter is a formal request…to interview you, under oath, regarding interactions that you had with Jane Doe No. 3 [the name used by Miss Roberts in legal proceedings] beginning in approximately early 2001. Jane Doe No. 3 was then 17 years old. Among other things, I would like to discuss events that occurred at the time that the photograph below was taken — and shortly thereafter. ‘I would also like to discuss Jane Doe 3’s claims of your subsequent interactions with her in New York City, New York later that year. ‘Details of those claims have been widely reported in the British press (with varying degrees of accuracy) as have your denials of the claims , so I assume that it is unnecessary for me to be any more specific about the proposed areas of our inquiry. ‘The interview could be conducted at a time and place of your choosing, and with your cooperation,’ The letter tops a damaging three weeks for Andrew since he was sensationally accused in U.S. court papers of abusing Miss Roberts when she 17. She alleged that under the orders of billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, she was ‘forced’ to have sex with him three times in 2001 - in London, New York and on Epstein’s Caribbean island. Andrew, 54, fiercely denies ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship’ with Miss Roberts and has consulted top criminal QC William Clegg. Prince Andrew, left, has been dragged into the controversy surrounding convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein (right). The two are pictured together in Central Park, in New York . Last night Miss Roberts spelt out for the first time in court papers the detail of her allegations against the Prince, Epstein and their mutual friend Ghislaine Maxwell – daughter of crooked tycoon Robert Maxwell. Miss Roberts stated: ‘Epstein made me have sex with Prince Andrew several times. I had sex with him three times, including one orgy. I knew he was a member of the British Royal Family, but I just called him “Andy.”’ She said the first instance of sexual contact happened in London at Miss Maxwell’s townhouse. ‘I got news from Maxwell that I would be meeting a prince. Later that day, Epstein told me I was meeting a “major prince.” ‘Epstein told me “to exceed” everything I had been taught. He emphasised that whatever Prince Andrew wanted, I was to make sure he got.’ ‘Eventually Prince Andrew arrived, along with his security guards. The guards then went out of the house and stayed out front in their car. It was just Epstein, Maxwell, and me inside alone with Andy. I was introduced to the Prince, and we kissed formally, cheek to cheek. Maxwell said “guess how old she is.” Prince Andrew guessed 17.’ Smiling coyly for the camera in a simple white blouse, this is Virginia Roberts around the time she has accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her. The photograph was taken by paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, the man she says turned her into a ‘sex slave’ and procured her for the Queen’s son. Photos: Virginia pictured aged 17 (left), in a picture taken by Epstein, and aged 15 (right). These pictures are two of five photos included in Miss Roberts's new legal submission . The snapshot is one of five photos included in Miss Roberts’s new legal submission to show how young she looked. ‘I was approximately 17 at the time,’ she said. She adds: ‘I visited and travelled with Jeffrey Epstein from 1999 through the summer of 2002. ‘I had sex with him often in these places and also with the various people he demanded that I have sex with.’ She said she included the photos to ‘illustrate my connection to these places’. Andrew took her to Tramp club before they returned to the townhouse where she and the Prince allegedly ‘went to the bathroom and bedroom…We engaged in sexual activities there. Afterwards, Andy left quickly with his security.’ The legal documents filed yesterday say that although Buckingham Palace has ‘recently denied that Prince Andrew had sexual contact’ with Miss Roberts, ‘it has not attempted to explain what led to the Prince having his picture taken with his arm around a 17 year old American girl at night in London in an intimate setting in a private residence’. The Duke of York - who strongly denies the claims 0 has enlisted the help of QC William Clegg (pictured), nicknamed the 'grandfather of the bar' ‘Nor has the Palace explained what Ghislaine Maxwell is doing there and who took that picture – while Jane Doe 3 (Miss Roberts) has provided a sworn affidavit that the photographer was Prince Andrew’s close friend (as well as sex trafficker and now registered sex offender) Jeffrey Epstein.’ In her statement, Miss Roberts said that in 2011, while living in Australia, she was interviewed by two FBI agents about her allegations. Last night a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘We have nothing to say in addition to our earlier comments on the issue.’ Previously, the Palace has said ‘any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue’, adding: ‘The Duke would never interfere in an active legal case and did not do so in this case’ Epstein, 61, was sentenced to 18 months in jail for paedophile offences. But he only served 13 months behind bars. This was due to a controversial plea bargain agreement between his ‘army of legal superstars’ and the U.S Government. A spokesperson for Miss Maxwell, 53, daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell, has strongly denied the allegations. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz - who is also named in the court papers - said the claims against him were part of a pattern of “made-up stories” by Miss Roberts (chck) and her lawyers against prominent people.

"The most controversial movie of 2014 could soon be in your movie queue. Netflix announced yesterday it will make The Interview available on demand for its U.S. and Canada customers at no additional charge starting on January 24. The comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un was previously made available to stream on Google Play, Xbox, YouTube and AppleTV for a fee after its wide theatrical release was canceled in the wake of the Sony hacking scandal. Netflix will make satirical comedy The Interview available on demand for US and Canada customers at no additional charge starting on January 24 . The film, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco as two journalists involved in a CIA plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, was at the center of the Sony hacking scandal last month . The Interview stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as two journalists involved in a CIA plot to kill the North Korean leader. Over the summer, the rogue state warned that the film's release would be an 'act of war that we will never tolerate' and said the U.S. will face 'merciless' retaliation. Sony pulled the planned Christmas Day wide-release of the film after hackers threatened 9/11-like terror attacks on cinemas showing the comedy. But it partially reversed the decision after the intervention of President Obama, allowing a limited release and making it available via video on demand. Neflix's chief content officer Ted Sarandos previously told television reporters the company was eager to deliver the film to customers during the semi-annual Television Critics Association press tour earlier this month. Mr Sarandos said the 'eye-opening' film was a 'great example of what could happen with a big-budget movie if you give people distribution choices, even limited distribution choices.' 'You can actually create a lot of revenue.' The film's depiction of the leader  (played here by actor Randall Park) angered North Korea. The country warned the film's release would be an 'act of war that we will never tolerate' and said the U.S. will face 'merciless' retaliation . In a statement, Netflix said it was 'thrilled to offer exclusively the controversial comedy to our U.S. and Canadian members just 30 days after it debuted in theaters and pay-per-view.' Netflix's announcement, which came as part of the company's fourth-quarter earnings release, was made on the same day Sony Pictures reported the film has grossed more than $40million in rentals and sales. It has also made around $6million domestically in its limited theatrical release. Last month Sony was targeted by a group of hackers that called themselves The Guardians of Peace, who released a number of company emails from top executives. Government officials revealed that North Korea was behind the hack on the movie studio, although North Korea continues to deny any involvement. Netflix's announcement, which came as part of the company's fourth-quarter earnings release, was made on the same day Sony Pictures reported the film had grossed over $40million in rentals and sales . Sony originally announced it would not release the film at all after the terrorist threats, a decision that came after the five largest theater chains in North America announced they would no longer show it. Neflix's chief content officer Ted Sarandos said the 'eye-opening' film proved companies could create a lot of revenue by giving the public multiple distribution choices . Many in Hollywood voiced their concern, with writer Aaron Sorkin saying how upset he was that 'the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists.' Actor Robe Lowe wrote that the move was 'an utter and complete victory' for the hackers. But it wasn't until President Obama spoke out that the company changed it's mind. During his end-of-year press conference, the president said Sony made a crucial error in self-censoring after a North Korean cyber attack. 'We cannot have a policy where some dictator somewhere can start imposing censorship here in the United States,' he said. The president then called out Kim Jong-Un, adding 'it says something about North Korea that its leaders thought a comedic movie posed a danger to their iron-fisted rule'. The real Kim in a mushroom factory. Sony is both the first studio to release a major motion picture online and the first to simultaneously allow for the viewing of a film across three different platforms . 'The notion that that was a threat to them?' he asked. 'I think that gives you some kind of sense of what kind of regime we're talking about here.' In a matter of days Sony made the film available for limited theatrical release on its original Christmas Day premiere date as well as online and via video on demand. At the time of its release, company CEO Michael Lynton said: 'While we hope this is only the first step of the film's release, we are proud to make it available to the public and to have stood up to those who attempted to suppress free speech.' The public responded with a massive outpouring of support for the film. Thousands turned out for Christmas Eve midnight screenings across the country and tens of thousands of Americans streamed the film online. Sony has now gone down it history for becoming the first studio to release a major motion picture online, as well as being the first studio to simultaneously allow for the viewing of a film across three different platforms.","Satire about assassination attempt on North Korean leader will be available to stream from January 24 .

"Arriving at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital two weeks ago for my long-awaited appointment, my mind was already on the pleasures I had planned for the next day. This meeting with a gynaecologist had been in the diary for three months, so it was hardly urgent, and I had no reason to doubt I would be in good spirits for my son’s 22nd birthday celebrations 24 hours later. Little did I know that within half an hour I would be emerging from the consultant’s office in a state of shock, having been through one of the most physically traumatic experiences of my life. Scroll down for video . Hetty Baynes (pictured) was scheduled for a routine examination for uterine fibroids, she left the consultant's office half an hour later in absolute agony . Far from the routine examination for uterine fibroids I had been led to expect, instead I was put through what amounted to an invasive surgical operation without an anaesthetic. The procedure reduced me to a screaming, sobbing, quivering wreck and left me so wiped out I could barely get out of bed for five days. It’s been a life-changing experience, leaving me feeling deeply vulnerable, and when I think back to the woman who’d sat calmly in the waiting room, it is as if she were a different person — someone who naively thought doctors would always act in her best interests. Hetty was due to celebrate her son Rex's 22nd birthday the day after the appointment but was left bedridden for five days after the traumatising experience . The condition which had led me there was unpleasant — heavy bleeding caused by fibroids in my womb — but certainly not life-threatening. For women of my age (I am 58), this situation could almost be described as routine. And when the doctor summoned me into her office with a broad smile I was once again reassured. ‘We’re just going to do a quick internal examination and you’ll be on your way,’ she told me. Then she paused and added: ‘Actually, while you’re here we should probably take a biopsy [to rule out cancer]. It will be a little bit uncomfortable, but there shouldn’t be any pain. Is that OK?’ Eager to help, I nodded, smiling. The first alarm bell rang when the nurse patted my shoulder and said: ‘Aren’t you brave? Some women can’t manage to have this done, so good for you.’ Puzzled, I decided the best policy was to keep smiling. But within five seconds of the procedure starting, a searing pain tore through my body. What ensued was a procedure known as an endometrial biopsy, in which the lining of the uterus is cut and scraped away. The procedure itself is common, especially among menopausal women. I had been through something similar in the past, but for one crucial detail: in this instance, I was given no anaesthetic whatsoever. Most of these procedures are done under general anaesthetic, with patients leaving hospital the same day. Some patients prefer to have an epidural, meaning they feel nothing from the waist down, but these are more complicated for the anaesthetist and generally take longer to recover from. Hetty, pictured in 2011, was in so much pain during the procedure that she likened the experience to childbirth, judging her pain at a 9 on a 1-10 scale . Perhaps the quickest and cheapest option is to forego the anaesthetic altogether. And this is what happened to me. It was a brutal experience. On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the pain of childbirth, I would rate it as a nine. As the doctor took the biopsy, which involves cutting away part of the uterus lining, then scraped right into my uterus and ovaries (a procedure designed to reduce heavy bleeding), I was exploding in pain. All the while the nurse was whispering in my ear: ‘You’re doing well. So brave. Breathe deeply, it’s almost done.’ Hetty Baynes, pictured here with former husband and film director Ken Russell. Hetty says she felt 'deceived and violated' after her experience in the consultant's office . Only it was far from over. For a quarter of an hour I screamed, bawled and panted like a woman in labour. The experience was so similar, I pointed out to the nurse that precisely 22 years earlier I had been in labour with my son, Rex. ‘Well, it’s not as bad as that, is it?’ she said, still smiling. In moments of extreme pain, time seems to stand still. A minute can seem like an hour. Then, just as I felt the agony would never end, the nurse said: ‘All done. I think you’ve earned a cup of coffee and a slice of cake.’ Dumbstruck, I left the room in a state of shock. Somehow I got home and fell into bed, spent. Hetty was treated at the Chelsea and Westminster hospital (pictured), but was not admitted for the procedure, she was treated as an outpatient . For five days I was exhausted. My son’s birthday was a washout. Instead of being treated by me to a day out, he was to spend the next week looking after me. As the days passed, as the shock retreated, anger took its place. Why had it happened? What on earth would possess any clinician to put a patient through that sort of experience? Exactly why hadn’t I been offered any anaesthetic? I felt deceived and violated. Not only was it painful, it was brutally intimate. Normally a woman will be unconscious or anaesthetised to the point where she is blissfully unaware of the procedure. Yet I had felt every scrape and cut. To me, it seemed that the doctor and nurse — quite a double act with their breezy compliments — had blatantly groomed me. I hadn’t even been asked to sign a consent form for the procedure. Was I ‘brave’, to repeat their mantra? Not particularly. Stupid would be a more apt description, to fall for this con trick which persuaded me not to make a fuss. Hetty Baynes, pictured last week, has said that given the horrific experience she had, she will be looking to get private health insurance in the future to prevent repeat experiences . During the five days of bed rest that followed, I had plenty of time to reflect on the reasons for my horrendous experience. I also learned I am not alone. My best friend’s daughter recently had a similar experience during a procedure in which dye was passed through her fallopian tubes. Again, she suffered excruciating pain, and again the subject of an anaesthetic never even came up. I also discovered that one woman who had an excruciating experience during a similar procedure to mine had taken the matter up with her MP, Lyn Brown, who raised the issue in the House of Commons. The MP said she’d been contacted by other women, all with horrifying stories. But why would any doctor put a woman through this? It is hard to escape the conclusion that it is related to spending cutbacks. Hetty, pictured here with former husband and son, Rex. Hetty was unable to work for a week after the procedure and says she has 'lost faith' in the NHS since it happened . Lying in bed, my mind wandered back to the nurse telling me so sweetly: ‘Most women aren’t able to do this.’ Presumably they pulled the plug on the procedure from the first agonising scrape. Why didn’t I? Because, perversely, I just wanted it to be over. The appointment had been in the diary for three months and having come this far there seemed little logic in turning back. Again and again I was told the procedure was ‘almost done’, only for it to go on for another ten minutes. In hindsight, I would have waited another year to have it done under anaesthetic, rather than endure that visceral pain. Hetty (pictured) says she wasn't even asked to sign a consent form before the procedure . Yet from the doctor’s perspective, this barbaric approach makes sense. The NHS is stretched to breaking point. If they can get away with treating me in half an hour, rather than booking out a hospital bed for an entire day and calling in the anaesthetist, then why not do it? While it’s not clear whether this policy is directly affecting pain relief provision in hospitals, the Government has pledged to financially reward those that increase the number of procedures done as an outpatient without a general anaesthetic — including hysteroscopies. I called my GP to seek advice. He was shocked at what had happened, advising me that it is a fundamental principle of medicine that the doctor should have stopped the moment I showed signs of being in severe distress. That they did not amounts to malpractice, and I am giving serious consideration to my options. I do not want to sue the NHS for money — the last thing the system needs is another drain on its finances. Yet I am determined this should not be allowed to continue. No matter what pressure doctors are under, they should not be allowed to hurt people like this. Much as I love the NHS, I am certain this never would have happened to me had I been a private patient. Because of this debacle I was unable to work for a week. Next month my latest acting project, opposite Sir Michael Gambon in the BBC adaptation of The Casual Vacancy, will be aired and I am as busy as ever. Taking time off is not an option. And if this experience has taught me one thing it is that I need to get myself some private health insurance, and fast. The hard-working people of the NHS may be doing their level best but I, for one, have lost faith. A spokesman for the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital said: ‘We want to provide the best quality care and patient experience possible and apologise for the fact Hetty feels we did not meet this. ‘We always try to avoid unnecessary surgery for every patient, as surgery carries risk. Obtaining an endometrial sample always takes place in the outpatient setting as part of the routine gynaecological consultation.’ Interview by RICHARD PRICE .","Hetty Baynes was due to have a routine examination for uterine fibroids .

The vision, which comes from inside Nanchang zoo in Jiangxi, south-east China, shows the keeper hoisting up the cub, hanging it upside down and slapping it repeatedly in the face. Animal rights groups have condemned the clip, saying it is ‘appalling’ and that they are chasing the zoo over the incident. Scroll down for video . A zoo keeper hoists up the cub, hangs it upside down and slaps it repeatedly in the face . The footage also shows the man in a red coat hanging the 40-day-old cub by its arm and violently shaking it until it crashes onto the floor. The 2.40 second long clip,  uploaded to LiveLeak, mentions the employee is under investigation by the zoo management in the description. Dave Neal, the director of Animals Asia, told Daily Mail Australia ‘we are of course appalled by the incident, which we are taking up with the zoo directly.’ ‘We hear from the zoo already that one of the keepers involved has been dismissed due to this incident,’ he said. Nicola Beynon, Head of Campaigns at World Animal Protection, said the setting of the video is a further sign of cruelty. 'Wild animals belong in the wild, not in crates where they’re subjected to horrible abuse,' she said. 'While we don’t know when or where this video was taken, the person in the video should be subjected to the full force of any laws prohibiting this cruel behaviour.' An animal rights group said one of the keepers involved has been dismissed due to this incident . One keeper can be seen hanging the cub by its arm and violently shaking it until it crashes onto the floor . An official from the zoo announced that the keeper has been dismissed over the incident and the cub is in good health. They said there will be substantial preventative measures taken to ensure the incident does not occur again, reports Shanghaiist. In 2010, The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development said it would be inspecting zoos nationwide to check if they were abusing animals, but a string of recent reports suggest the problem is still rife.","The vision comes from inside Nanchang zoo in Jiangxi, south-east China .

"A nanny accused of killing two children in their Manhattan home before attempting to take her own life appeared in court on Wednesday. Yoselyn Ortega, 52, covered the self-inflicted, knife wound scars on her neck with a white turtleneck and a fleece top, bowing her head as she sat alongside her defense attorney at Manhattan's Criminal Court. The hearing was adjourned until March 20. Ortega  is accused of stabbing to death six-year-old Lucia Krim, and her little brother Leo, aged two, at the family's Upper West Side apartment in October 2012. Accused killer Yoselyn Ortega appeared in court on Wednesday in Manhattan, where she covered up the scars on her neck by wearing a turtleneck sweater . Ortega, 52, was handcuffed as she entered Manhattan criminal court on Wednesday for a hearing . Victims: Six-year-old Lucia Krim, left, and her little brother, two-year-old Leo, were found dead in their Upper West Side apartment in 2012. Their nanny is accused of first-degree murder . The children's mother, Marina Krim was picking up her third child, Nessie, from a swimming lesson when she returned to find her children dead in the bathtub. Ortega, 52, was lying beside the children, having cut her throat in a suicide attempt. According to court documents in November, Ortega told authorities that she hurt the children because she was having money problems and was angry at the parents. She said her schedule constantly shifted, she had to act as a cleaning lady though she didn't want to and she missed an appointment with 'the psych,' according to the papers. 'I had to do everything and take care of the kids,' she said. 'God forgive me, so many things they made me do. Pray for me.' Ortega's attorney, Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg had also claimed in November that her client had no memory of the horrifying attacks. The lawyer claimed that after showing the accused killer images of the gruesome scene, 'she turns to me and says, ""Oh, my God, who did that to them?"" She has no mind, no memory of the incident'. Ortega, a  Dominican immigrant, has been charged with murder but maintains she is innocent. A judge has declared her mentally fit to stand trial. Following the tragedy, the Krims have begun to rebuild their lives. Mrs Krim and her TV executive husband Kevin had another son, Felix, who is now around a year old.

"Few road vehicles could hope to outrun an aeroplane. But thanks to a 12,000 horsepower engine and a top speed of almost 400mph, this rocket-propelled Chevy can do just that. The vehicle known as the 'Flash Fire Chevy' is the brainchild of retired businessman Neal Darnell of Springfield, Missouri - who built it after he retired. Scroll down for video . The Flash Fire Chevy built by retired American businessman Neal Darnell which is able to reach speeds of almost 400mph . Together with his son Chris, Mr Darnell took a engine from a US Navy fighter jet and built the vehicle around it, meaning it can go from 0-60 in one and a half seconds . The vehicle is so fast that Mr Darnell races it against aeroplanes and he can often outrun them thanks to the car's 12,000 horsepower engine . Together with his son Chris, the pair took a Pratt and Whitney engine from a US Navy trainer jet called the T-2 Buckeye and built the vehicle around it. With the additional rocket power, the Chevy is able to accelerate from 0-60 in 1.5 seconds - exerting up to G-Force 6 on the driver. It can easily hit 350mph and has reached a top recorded speed of 375mph at airshows, where it impresses the crowds by catching up with light aeroplanes flying a few metres above. Mr Darnell, 65, said: 'The truck is a Chevy S-10 replica. The body mould actually came from a real Chevy S-10. 'Basically to build one of these things you set the engine in the shop and then you build the truck around it. 'The frame is all chrome alloy steel and it was formed around the engine and made to fit the body. It's basically a two-year project and a lot of money.' Mr Darnell races the car at airshows in the U.S. where he impresses the crowds by catching up and outrunning light aeroplanes flying above .

Mr Darnell, who also races Shockwave, the World's Fastest Jet-Powered Truck, had worked in motor sports show production for 20 years before retiring - and then decided to put himself in the front seat. He added: 'Prior to my airshow career we promoted monster-truck races, truck and tractor pulls and motocross events, that kind of thing, so it was kind of a natural progression. 'I have always raced something on the side. I have raced motorcycles, sand dragsters, funny cars and so when I retired I wanted to get into something that was fun and exciting. He added: 'Everybody loves speed. I will always love speed. And this vehicle is definitely the ultimate speedster.'","Retired businessman Neal Darnell built the 'Flash Fire Chevy' which has a top speed of almost 400mph .

"The mother of a young woman whose battle with brain cancer drew widespread attention to her desire to legally end her life with prescribed drugs in California appeared Wednesday in the state Capitol to push for aid-in-dying legislation. Debbie Ziegler said that lawmakers should honor her daughter, Brittany Maynard, by passing a bill that would allow terminally ill patients to kill themselves in California with drugs and dosages recommended by a doctor. The practice is legal in five states, including Oregon, where Maynard moved before her suicide November 1. The 29-year-old San Francisco Bay Area woman had made her case public with online videos, saying in clips that were viewed tens of millions of times that she should have been able to legally obtain life-ending drugs in California. Scroll down for video . Hoping for change: Debbie Ziegler, the mother of Brittany Maynard, speaks in support of proposed legislation allowing doctors to prescribe life ending medication on Wednesday January 21, 2015, in Sacramento . In memoriam: Three California lawmakers are promoting right-to-die legislation with the family of Brittany Maynard, a terminally ill woman who ended her life early under Oregon law on November 1 . Advocacy: Debbie Ziegler wants terminally ill patients during to have the choice to end their own lives . 'Most Californians would not be able to do what we did,' Ziegler said. 'They couldn't leave their homes; they couldn't leave their jobs; they couldn't leave their families, their friends, their pets. 'We had to do all of that. It added another layer of pain.' Advocates for aid-in-dying laws say Maynard's story has recharged legislative efforts across the nation. Similar bills have been introduced in Pennsylvania, Wyoming and Washington, D.C., and are being considered in New York and Colorado. Such proposals, however, have foundered in statehouses for years amid emotionally charged debates and strong opposition. Some medical groups say prescribing life-ending medication violates a doctor's oath to do no harm, while some advocates for persons with disabilities fear some sick patients would feel pressured to end their lives to avoid being a financial burden. It's too early to predict how the newly introduced California bill will fare. Lawmakers expect the proposal to face a strong challenge, led by medical and religious groups. Appreciation: Debbie Ziegler, left, the mother of Brittany Maynard, talks with Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, after she spoke in support of proposed legislation allowing doctors to prescribe life ending medication . Widower: Dan Diaz, the husband of Brittany Maynard, speaks in support of proposed legislation allowing doctors to prescribe life ending medication to terminally ill patients during a news conference Wednesday . Overcome: Debbie Ziegler is the mother of Brittay Maynard, a 29-year-old San Francisco Bay Area woman who had terminal brain cancer and moved to Oregon where she could legally end her life . Advocates said they would consider taking the issue to voters if it fails in the Legislature. A debate in the California Assembly last year illustrated the volatility of discussions on end-of-life topics. A bill that would have required doctors to discuss palliative and hospice care with gravely ill patients drew an emotional debate. Lawmakers' voices broke as they spoke about relatives who outlived doctor's expectations and others struggled describing loved ones who suffered agonizing pain before their deaths. The bill passed after a lengthy fight. 'It's personal for people, people argue it from their heart,' said Assemblywoman Susan Eggman, a Stockton Democrat who authored that bill and is co-authoring the new measure, SB128. 'Everybody should have the ability at the end of their life to have as much say-so over what they want to happen as possible.' Opponents, however, see huge consequences for allowing doctors to prescribe fatal drugs. 'Legalizing assisted suicide is a deadly mix with our broken cost driven cost system,' said Marilyn Golden, policy analyst for the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund. 'You have to consider all the people who can be harmed, not just a small number of people who may be helped.'","Debbie Ziegler spoke at a news conference in Sacramento Wednesday .

"Boeing's disaster-hit Dreamliner aircraft ran into trouble again yesterday when a Japan Airlines flight from Boston was forced to turn around and return to its destination. The pilot of the 787 decided to return to Boston's Logan Airport due to a possible issue with the plane's fuel pump. Last week, Heathrow Airport was temporarily shut down after a Dreamliner operated by Ethiopian Airlines developed a fire which has been linked to the battery in its emergency beacon. Trouble: Another Dreamliner has been forced to abort its flight due to technical problems (file photo) The entire fleet of 787s was grounded earlier this year thanks to repeated faults in the lithium-ion batteries which sometimes led to plane fires. Japan Airlines flight 007 from Logan to Tokyo's Narita Airport returned to Boston yesterday 'as a standard precautionary measure', according to a spokesman for the airline. The pilot took action after seeing a maintenance message indicator suggesting there was a problem with the fuel pump. He landed the plane safely and did not declare a state of emergency.

July 3 2013: Polish airline LOT cancelled a Dreamliner flight to Chicago because the aircraft had ‘problems with the power supply'. July 12 2013: Ethiopian Airlines plane catches fire on the runway at Heathrow, forcing the closure of the whole airport. The plane left for Tokyo around 1pm EDT, and was expected to take around 14 hours to reach its destination, but landed again at Logan just before 6.30. After the flight was cancelled, all its passengers were reassigned to other flights. Japan Airlines 787s have previously malfunctioned at Logan on at least two occasions - in January, a battery fire broke out on a Dreamliner shortly after all its passengers had exited. The next day, another 787 belonging to the airline leaked 40 gallons of fuel on the runway. The latest Dreamliner fire, at Heathrow last Friday, caused the whole airport to be shut down for an hour and a half while firefighters battled the blaze. It emerged yesterday that the fire had been caused by a fault in the lithium battery powering the plane's emergency beacon. The beacon, which is used by emergency services to located the aircraft in the event of an accident, could now be disabled on all Dreamliners. The battery is different to the lithium-ion battery which was responsible for a spate of fires earlier this year. All 787s were grounded around the world in January this year while officials investigated the source of the problem. The aircraft is the latest high-profile project from Boeing, which hoped that the Dreamliner would revolutionise commercial flight thanks to its innovative design.","Pilot turned round and returned to origin after seeing warning message .

"A globetrotting musician from Barcelona has gone all out in recreating German composer J. S. Bach's first Cello Suite. Singing 658 notes over 329 days in more than 25 cities across the world, Publio Delgado has managed to achieve his very own work of art. The 30-year-old, who performed at concerts around the globe to fund his travels, remained disciplined in his filming. The result is this unique video travel log with a highly impressive soundtrack indeed. Explaining why he chose Bach's Cello Suite No.1, he tells MailOnline: . 'I needed a piece composed only by a melody, without harmony, so I could just sing it by myself without having to depend on including other people for other possible voices. 'This was perfect for it, not only because it met that requirement, but also because it's a beautiful and world wide well known piece.' A NOTEworthy performance: Publio Delgado from Barcelona managed to perform Bach's cello suite No.1 by singing two chords a day during his time abroad . Each day, for just under a year, Publio found the time to sing two pitches in order to imitate this classical music extravaganza almost to perfection, despite having a very active social life. One moment he's busy exploring a range of stunning landscapes across Japan and the next he is chilling on the beach back in Spain, using the subway in NYC, or playing in the snow in Boston. But, as filming spans such a long period of time, he is often seen completing mundane tasks too such as bathing, hanging up laundry or even lying down for a nap. In the footage, you are immediately thrown into the traveller's exciting world as he spends time with close friends, near and far. If only for a brief moment, it is fantastic to see all the different backdrops that make up nearly a year of his care-free life. Fast paced: The 30-year-old offers viewers a brief glimpse into his travels as he sings each chord in a different location . However, Publio admits that he faced some technical difficulties while piecing the project together. One month before he finished, his editing software crashed and he lost all his hard work. But luckily he had been keeping the videos in two different hard-drives, just in case something like that happened, and he began reediting it from the beginning. 'I wanted to shoot the video in the most beautiful possible landscapes,' he adds. 'For example, in Japanese island Hachijojima I climbed up a mountain for three hours just to get a good shot of the island, and then I got lost on my way back and it took me other 3-4 hours to get back to the village. Now he's here, now he's there: Publio visits Spain, Japan and New York during 11 months of travel . 'Some other days, right before sleeping I just realised I hadn't recorded anything that day so I just did whatever.' During his time travelling, Publio says he did not have a specific route and booked tickets to different places on 'impulse', especially when he found a good deal and could afford it. 'Every city/village/culture I visited has their own thing going on; their own strengths, their own weaknesses, and instead of deciding which one is the best, I'd rather just try to get influenced by the best of each place.' Disciplined: Not a day passes that the golden voiced globetrotter missed a note . Upon his return, is there anywhere where is desperate to travel to again? He says: 'I always repeat destinations and I try to travel places when they have their best weather. 'I like to go up north in Europe on summer, Asia in fall and spring and the south of Spain in winter. 'There's still a lot of places I haven't been, I never visited the south hemisphere, and either Africa, South America or Oceania are continents where I really really want to go. And what advice would he give to anyone traveling around the world? 'Instead of visiting the tallest tower, the oldest temple, the biggest shopping mall, why not just try to live a daily life with local people, blend with their culture, eat where they eat, hang where they hang, and eventually become one more of them?' 'I wanted to shoot in the most beautiful possible landscapes' - Publio mixed stunning scenery with the breathtaking classical piece to create a very special art work of his own .

"The Royal Mint has started selling gold and silver bars directly to the public for the first time. Silver minted bars are available in 100g units, while the gold bars range from 1g to 100g. Depending on the price of the precious metals at the time of purchase, a 1g gold bar could cost around £40, while 100g could be around £2,800. The bars are branded with the initials RMR for Royal Mint Refinery, which was last used in 1968. Golden deal: The Royal Mint has started selling gold and silver bars directly to the public for the first time . The Royal Mint Refinery marque dates back to 1852 and the brand became known for handling much of the gold and silver bullion sent to London from across the world for processing under the RMR label. The name survived the First and Second World Wars until production ceased in 1968. The new bars are likely to appeal to people looking for a 'cost-effective' way to buy bullion, with the gold bars having the added appeal of being VAT-free, the Mint said. UK citizens looking to enhance their self-invested personal pension (Sipp) or small self-administered scheme can get up to 45 per cent tax relief on their purchase of gold RMR bars if they are bought through their pension scheme. Solid price: Gold bars range from 1g to 100g, and silver are available in 100g units . Lisa Elward, the Royal Mint's head of international sales and bullion, said: 'We are thrilled to be able to add minted bars bearing the historic Royal Mint Refinery marque to our bullion range.' The RMR bars are being made available directly to customers through royalmintbullion.com, the Mint's online bullion trading platform which was set up last September to help people to buy and sell gold easily and securely. When the Mint set up the site, it said that consumers had in the past been been deterred by perceived barriers to buying precious metals. It also pointed to research by the World Gold Council which suggested that there was potentially £4 billion-worth of untapped demand for gold investment within the UK alone. As well as bearing the RMR logo, the bars will also be given a unique serial number.","Gold bars range from 1g to 100g, and silver  are available in 100g units .

'When I opened the door, I looked and there was a black man in the sauna. It wasn’t my dad so I shut the door and I looked, the clothes hanging, it was his clothes,' Lara Antiporek told CBS. 'While I called 911, I was opening the door so I could breathe,' Laura Antiporek told Local 10. Ronnie recalls seeing her husband of nearly 50 years' skin smeared on the floor and the bench of the sauna. Ronnie says she can't shake the blood curdling images of her husband's corpse from her mind no matter how hard she tries. 'I close my eyes and I just see his face charred,' said Ronnie Antiporek in shock. Broken timer: the family believes that a broken timer was the cause of Dennis' horrifying death inside a sauna that cooked him until he turned black . Devastated: Ronnie Antiporek says she and her husband would have celebrated their 50 years of marriage . Residential community: Dennis died in the sauna at Eden Isles condominium where his family believes a faulty timer in the scorching hot room caused him to cook to death . 'And this sounds horrible, but there was skin on the floor and on the bench and we shouldn't have had to see that,' she added. Dennis and Ronnie's love first ignited in high school. Dennis would have been 69 soon and he also would have celebrated his 50th wedding anniversary. The family has hired an attorney to file a wrongful death lawsuit against the condominium for what they believe is not checking the safety of the sauna and for having a faulty timer. 'First and foremost, we want to make sure that this community maintains a level of safety for all residents,' said Attorney Joseph Madalon to CBS. 'We believe at this point in time that he died by asphyxiation by becoming overheated,' family attorney Douglas Ede said to Local 10.

"Her superstar father - and the circumstance of her birth - made her famous before she could even walk. But last night 14-year-old Anna Ermakova stepped out of Boris Becker's shadow and on to the catwalk as she appeared at Berlin Fashion Week. The tennis star's  lovechild was conceived during a scandalous, short-lived and much disputed encounter at the London outpost of celebrity haunt Nobu in 1999. Her mother Angela Ermakova initially claimed the liaison took place in a store cupboard but Becker later confessed they had made love on a staircase between two bathrooms. Scroll down for video .

Exuding easy confidence, it seemed hard to believe that it was the teenager's modelling debut. She was recently signed to Mega Modelling Agency and as her profile states, her height - she is 5ft 10 - and striking features have got her noticed among talent hawks despite her youth. Now she says she has a 'mind of my own' and is only allowed to pursue her dream of a modelling career 'because I am doing so well at school.' After being allowed to open and close the show for Riani she told German newspaper Bild: 'This is an absolute dream which has come true for me. All my girlfriends dream about such a chance. Everything went incredibly quickly for me.' Of course, she said she knows that it is a fact that her name opens doors, adding; 'Yes, but I cannot make myself unknown.' Boris acknowledged Anna was his child in February 2001 and obtained joint custody of his daughter in November 2007 (pictured together when Anna was younger) Proud father Boris posted this Tweet to his 586,000 followers with a link to a picture of Anna on the catwalk . Boris captioned the picture of his daughter 'What a beautiful young lady #Anna #family #Berlin #mbfw' Boris went on Twitter shortly after her debut to express his pride in her and Anna admitted that her mother, 47, whom she lives with in London, is equally proud of her and accompanied her to Berlin from the home they share in London. Though she has inherited her father's ginger hair and his distinctive features, it seems she has followed in her mother's footsteps when it comes to her career. She starred in German label Riani's autumn/winter 2015 show on Tuesday, modelling a series of dresses for the brand before walking the catwalk with Riani designers Ulrich Schulte and Isi Degel. Anna went on: 'It isn't it about the money. I also do not consider myself as a professional. It's a small beginning of something that I want to try.' Ted Linow, her agent at Mega Models, refused to discuss her earnings saying: 'No models talk about that.' Asked if 14 was a little early to start work, she said: 'My mother is, naturally, always with me and I want it that way. That's what I'm doing here, an excursion into a new world, which I really love. I really never expected to cause such a frenzy.' While 14-year-old Anna looked stunning in a silver dress, the giant poodle was not explained . Anna paused to 'pet' the poodle at the end of the runway before allowing it to walk on ahead of her . In another interview with German glossy magazine Gala, Anna insisted: 'I am not a child any more and I believe modelling is the key to bringing me further along in life, perhaps even as a full-time career. I think people probably have other things to interest them other than my name - I'm seeking to simply be myself.' Boris, a five-time Wimbledon winner and currently the coach of world number one Novak Djokovic, had initially denied that Anna was his daughter. But after a DNA test in DNA test in February 2001 proved he was the father, he agreed to support Anna and obtained joint custody in November 2007 . The 'five second' romp not only produced a daughter, but cost Becker his marriage to Barbara, with whom he has two sons. The divorce settlement came in at £20million. The German star has previously spoken of his 'guilt and shame' over the quickie which happened just after he announced his retirement. Despite the high price he paid for the brief encounter, he claims he now loves the daughter who he initially doubted was his. He said: 'I live and learn. It cost my marriage, it cost for the next couple of years my private life but having Anna is not a mistake any more. I have a beautiful daughter. I love her very much.' Despite the publicity and scandal surrounding her conception, Anna has managed to remain largely out of the spotlight during her childhood. Despite this being her first ever appearance on the catwalk, Anna seemed very confident . After the slightly bizarre walk with the white poodle, Anna hit the runway again for Riani in a more conservative fashion in a navy flapper style dress (right) Anna as a baby with her mother, German model Angela Ermakova (left) is the result of a liaison on a stairwell with the five-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker (right) Boris has two sons, Noah, left, and Elias, right, with his first wife Barbara . According to Anna, she likes playing soccer in her spare time and is a visitor to a private London gym. And the report said that in her life her mother is an 'omnipresent' figure. But Anna insists: 'My mother neither dominates nor manipulates me. I have my own mind. Nevertheless, I want my mother to be more of a girlfriend.' Angela said that as Anna grows she realises she will have to step back from her life, adding: 'Every small ship must sometime sail off alone in the open sea.' Boris pictured with wife Sharlely Lilly Kerssenberg . Born in 1967 in Leimen, West Germany, Boris became a professional tennis playing in 1984 at the age of 17. He caused a storm in the sport when, as an unseeded adolescent he became the youngest player to ever win the Wimbledon men's final. In the course of his career he won a total of 49 singles and 15 doubles titles including three wins at Wimbledon, reaching the iconic final seven times in 10 years. Becker married his first wife Barbara Feltus in Decemeber 1993 and the couple went on to have two sons together; Noah, born on January 18, 1994, and Elias, born on September 4, 1999. However in the summer of 1999, having just retired from tennis, Boris had his now much publicised trist with model Angela Ermakova at Nobu in London. When his wife Barbara found out about the one night stand - which occured while she was pregnant with their second child- she moved to Florida and filed for divorce. She fought their pre-nuptual agreement and managed to win £14,400,000 and the custody of both sons in divorce court. Boris has since said during the argument in which he confessed his infidelity, Barbara struck him. The one night stand also resulted in Angela becoming pregnant. Although Boris disputed paternity for months - even suggesting in a German paper that Angela, working for the Russia government- had stolen his sperm and impregnated herself. His daughter Anna was born on 22 March 2000 . A DNA test in February 2001 proved Boris was the father and he agreed to support Anna and obtained joint custody in November 2007. During this period Boris also had a firey on-again-off-again relationship with German rap singer Sabrina Setlur, as well as breifly becoming engaged to to Alessandra Meyer-Wölden . Moving to Switzerland and enjoying a few years less in the media spotlight, Becker remarried in 12 June 2009 in St Moritz, Switzerland to Dutch model Sharlely Lilly Kerssenberg . The couple have a three-year-old son named Amadeus Benedict Edley Luis Becker.","Anna walked the runway at Berlin Fashion Week for designer Riani .

"A prominent Republican woman launched a she-said, she-said battle over wages on Wednesday morning by accusing the White House of paying women less than men – just hours after President Barack Obama begged Congress to outlaw the practice. High-stakes gender politics made an appearance in Tuesday's State of the Union address when the president insisted that 'Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.' 'Really,' he said to cheers from Democrats on Capitol HIll. 'It’s 2015. It’s time.' On Wednesday morning former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina claimed 'the president hasn't really led in this regard. He's not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House.' 'He's not paying women equally,' former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina (left) said of the president, during a morning-show joust with White House adviser Valerie Jarrett (right) President Barack Obama made a point of mentioning pay equity for women in his State of the Union speech, a political dog-whistle that motivates Democratic voters but is subject to widely varying interpretation . The line brought applause from Democrats but not much enthusiasm from Republicans, who 'won't stand – literally – for pay equity,' according to some wags on Twitter . Fiorina, herself a potential 2016 presidential candidate, glossed over details from the administration's annual Report to Congress on White House Staff that show women are paid equally for the same work but aren't trusted with as many high-level jobs. She aired her complaint on MSNBC's Morning Joe program, where she faced off against top Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. 'Every woman across the nation agrees that equal pay for equal work is absolutely required,' Fiorina said. 'I also think it's just a fact that laws exist on the books today, and if a woman is being discriminated against because of her gender, she should use the full extent of that law.' Jarrett fired back. 'Let's unpack your question a little bit. ... In the White House women do earn equal pay for equal work,' she said. Obama's salary data show that male white-collar White House employees earn an average of about $88,600, compared with $78,400 for females. That 13 per cent wage gap is in line with the federal government as a whole, according to the Office of Personnel Management. But it's larger than the overall gap in the District of Columbia, which the Washington Post reports is 9.9 per cent. Nationally, women in the U.S. earn 23.5 per cent less than men. That number, like the White House's, results in large part from women holding more junior-level jobs with lower salaries. Fewer men take time away from their careers to raise children, giving them access to continued career advancement and salary growth. And some researchers point to trends in women's employment that suggest many mothers accept lower wages in exchange for better health benefits and greater flexibility in working hours. That may be one reason why 87 men in the White House earn six-figure salaries, something only 53 women on Obama's staff can say.compared to 53 female White House officials. The White House's 2014 report also showed that there are two more men than women in the highest-ranking positions. Fiorina's spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the longtime tech executive, who ran an unsuccessful bid for a California U.S> Senate seat in 2012, hinted during the on-air tussle that her real target was labor unions and their preference for seniority-based pay systems. 'The single greatest impediment to equal pay for equal work is this seniority system, which pays not on merit, not on performance, but on time and grade,' she claimed. 'And who is it who supports the seniority system? Unions, government bureaucracies, the vast majority of constituencies that the Democratic party represents and who support the Democratic party.' Paying women 'by merit and by their results,' Fiorina insisted, would result in a system where 'women will be paid equally.' Fiorina, a onetime US Senate candidate in California, now lives in Virginia and is weighing a presidential run in 2016 . Jarrett is among the Obamas' oldest friends from their Chicago days, and is seen in Washington as a political 'fixer' who has the president's ear more often than his Cabinet secretaries . Jarrett fired back that Obama's State of the Union barb about pay equity was a reference to the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that Republicans have consistently blocked since 2009. The National Women's Law Center supports the measure, saying it would allow judges to take a close look at companies' pay practices to be sure any gender disparities 'serve a legitimate business purpose' and spring from 'factors other than sex.' Business advocates and their Republican supporters, however, maintain that there is a broad list of reasons why some women earn less than some men. In 2009 the U.S. Department of Labor commissioned a study from the CONSAD Research Corporation that counseled the government on how to interpret wage data from the U.S. Census and other sources. It found that 'differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors.' 'The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers,' the report concluded. The Equal Pay Act Of 1963 already makes it illegal to pay women less than men for performing the same job in the same company.","Former HP chief Carly Fiorina blasted Obama confidante Valerie Jarrett over the president's State of the Union demand for pay equity .

"Olympic legend Michael Johnson says a ‘superior athletic gene’ in the descendants of West African slaves means black American and Caribbean sprinters will command the sport at the London Games. The Olympic gold medallist and BBC commentator said: ‘Over the last few years, athletes of Afro- Caribbean and Afro-American descent have dominated athletics finals. ‘It’s a fact that hasn’t been discussed openly before. It’s a taboo subject in the States but it is what it is. Why shouldn’t we discuss it?’ Legacy: Michael Johnson, pictured in Jamaica, says black American and Caribbean sprinters have a 'superior athletic gene' Reigning Olympic 100m champion Usain Bolt was born in Trelawny Parish, Jamaica, where British Olympic boss Lord Coe’s plantation-owning ancestor George Hyde Park had 297 slaves. Of the eight 100m finalists four years ago, three were Jamaicans, two came from Trinidad and Tobago, two were Afro-American and one, representing the Netherlands, was born on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao. All eight are believed to be descended from slaves. Johnson says: ‘It is currently being researched to see how much of a factor being descended from slaves contributes to athletic ability.’ Some scientists believe a combination of selective breeding by slave owners and appalling conditions meant that only the strongest slaves endured, creating a group predisposed to record-breaking athletic performance. African slaves underwent a rigorous selection process and only the fittest were transported on ships. Interestingly, the toughest journey was to Jamaica, the last stop on the slave trail. Taboo: Usain Bolt (right), pictured winning the Olympic 100m final in Beijing in 2008, was born in Trelawny Parish, Jamaica, where British Olympic boss Lord Coe¿s plantation-owning ancestor George Hyde Park had 297 slaves . During one voyage in 1732, a staggering 96 per cent of slaves lost their lives – 170 boarded the ship and only six got off. Jamaican geneticist Dr Rachael Irving said: ‘There was not much oxygen on slave ships so they had to use whatever they had to survive.’ Dr Herb Elliott, doctor to the Jamaican Olympic team, added: ‘Only the most aggressive and fiercest slaves ended up in Jamaica.’ Johnson, 44, had a DNA test for a Channel 4 documentary, Michael Johnson: Survival Of The Fastest, to be screened on Thursday night, which confirmed he is of West African descent. He said: ‘All my life  I believed I became an athlete through my own determination, but it’s impossible to think that being descended from slaves hasn’t left an imprint through the generations. ‘Difficult as it was to hear, slavery has benefited descendants like me – I believe there is a superior  athletic gene in us.’ Champion: A DNA test confirmed that Johnson, pictured celebrating gold in 1996, is of West African descent .","Olympic champion Michael Johnson says black American and Caribbean sprinters have a 'superior athletic gene'

"Devastating words spoken by the five-year-old boy whose parents were allegedly stabbed to death by his mother's ex husband reveals that the youngster has no comprehension that he will never see his parents again. 'Mummy and Daddy are dead and there’s blood everywhere,' the child told his neighbours, Nepia and Megan Kino, adding that his parents were going to the hospital to 'get sewn up'. The gut wrenching words didn't end there with the orphaned boy saying: 'I’m going to take them to hospital to fix their cuts so they can get better,' The Courier Mail reported. The boy, who was found wandering the family home at Upper Coomera on the Gold Coast just after 5.30pm on Wednesday by his aunt who located the two bodies, may have been in the house for an entire day before the gruesome discovery. Scroll down for video . The parents of a five-year-old boy were found dead inside the family home at Upper Coomera on the Gold Coast just after 5.30pm on Wednesday . The 39-year-old woman and 43-year-old man were found dead inside this suburban Gold Coast home. Police say the house will remain a crime scene for at least a week . Police believe the victims, Renee Carter, 39, and her partner Corey Croft, 43, were stabbed to death in the home at around 8pm on Tuesday evening. The boy was consoled by a detective outside his home on Skylark Street dressed in a blue forensic suit believed to be used when someone may have evidence on their body, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports. Christopher Robert Carter, 36, has been charged with murdering the pair and didn't speak or show any emotion during a brief appearance at Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday. Regional crime co-ordinator Detective Superintendent David Hutchinson confirmed that Carter is the ex-husband of the woman who was killed. They have been divorced for seven years, according to Nine News. Supt. Hutchinson said a knife was used in the double murder of Ms Carter and Mr Croft and that the woman's sister found the pair when she visited the house after being unable to make contact. Police believe the boy was asleep at the time and are confident he did not witness the deaths. He did however spend the following day in the home with his parents' bodies. Police are now searching another premises for possible bloodied clothing and have appealed for anyone who saw a white 1999 model Mitsubishi Pajero four-wheel drive in the area over the last week to come forward. Supt. Hutchinson said the boy was not involved in the fatal incident and was unharmed. He is being cared for by relatives after speaking with police. 'You would understand that a five-year-old child being inside the house under those circumstances would have to be very traumatic,' Supt Hutchinson said. 'You've just got to hope at the end of the day that he's young enough to minimise the impact on him.'

"The security system at Vice President Joe Biden's Delaware private residence malfunctioned so badly late last year that Secret Service agents had to shut it off. What's more, Saturday's shooting outside the New Castle County estate, when a motorist unloaded several rounds before speeding away, wasn't caught on camera because there wasn't one trained on the road, the Washington Post reports. Despite the gaps in his home's security--and the embattled state of affairs within the Secret Service ranks--Vice President Biden said he's not concerned about his family's safety. Revealed: The security system at Vice President Joe Biden's private residence in Delaware malfunctioned so badly last year that it was shut off for months prior to servicing, it was revealed Tuesday . Scary: News of the faulty security system comes just days after a motorist drove by the vice president's home over the weekend and unloaded several rounds from a firearm . Biden tells CBS This Morning on Wednesday his house is way off the road, and that there was no evidence that someone shot at the house. Biden says it appears someone fired from the passenger side of the vehicle, and his house is on the driver's side. He said, 'I'm not at all worried.' Biden quipped that he doesn't think anyone's trying to get him — 'at least not physically.' The Washington Post's report on Tuesday nonetheless reveals some potentially gaping cracks in the mansion's security perimeter. 'I'm not at all worried': Biden said on Wednesday that he's not concerned about the security at his home . Changes? Following the shooting, it was revealed that no security cameras were pointed toward the road at Biden's home. The Secret Service is now looking into installing additional cameras after they failed to catch the gun-toting motorist on camera . The home's security system was shut off for months because of false alarms and unreliable data, a source told the Post. While the system was repaired in November, this weekend's incident has led to the Secret Service to propose adding more cameras in order to cover a broader area outside the home. Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan did not provide any details on potential upgrades. 'As a practice the Secret Service does not discuss the condition, number or locations of cameras and alarms at facilities we protect since this is the type of information our adversaries desire,' Donovan told the Post. 'On the night of the incident in Delaware, the appropriate security measures were in place and fully functioning.' Shakeup: The incident at Biden's home came as a major shakeup was taking place within the ranks of the embattled Secret Service . Four of the highest-ranking Secret Service executives have been reassigned following a series of security mishaps and scathing reports questioning leadership within the agency, the Secret Service said last week. Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy recently said 'change is necessary' within his agency . The agency's assistant directors for investigations, protective operations, technology and public affairs have all been reassigned within the Secret Service. Acting Director Joseph P. Clancy said in a statement that he was making leadership changes based on a December report from an independent panel that described the agency as 'insular' and 'starved for leadership.' 'Change is necessary to gain a fresh perspective on how we conduct business,' Clancy said. 'I am certain any of our senior executives will be productive and valued assets either in other positions at the Secret Service or the department.' The four officials are: Dale Pupillo, who led protective operations; Paul Morrissey, who oversaw the agency's investigative mission; Jane Murphy, who was governmental and public affairs chief; and Mark Copanzzi, who headed up technology and the tools for mission support. Details of their new posts were not released Wednesday. The reassignments are the biggest shift in Secret Service leadership since former Director Julia Pierson was forced to resign last year. Her ouster came after a Texas man armed with a knife was able to get over a White House fence and run deep into the executive mansion before being subdued and details of a previous presidential security breach were disclosed. Former Secret Service Director Julia Pierson was forced to resign last year after a crazed Texas man armed with a knife was able to get deep into the White House . The Washington Post first reported the staff shakeup last week. The independent panel, which investigated the agency's leadership and practices in the wake of the September incident and the disclosure of a previously unreported security breach earlier that month, also recommended hiring a new director from outside the agency. A permanent director has not been named. That report was the second critical review of the agency responsible for protecting the president. In November the Homeland Security Department, which oversees the Secret Service, released an internal investigation about the fence-scaling incident, which concluded that poor training, staff and a series of missteps led to the breach. Homeland Security investigators found, among other things, that uniformed agents patrolling the White House grounds the night of Sept. 19 mistakenly assumed that thick bushes near the mansion's front door would stop the intruder.","False alarms went off enough in the Delaware home last year that Secret Service shut down the system for months before November repairs .

"An 18-year-old Kentucky man who allegedly went on a crime spree with his underage girlfriend - earning them comparisons with Bonnie and Clyde - has said that the girl convinced him she was 18. Speaking on camera from Bay County Jail in Florida, Dalton Hayes said 13-year-old Cheyenne Phillips showed him a fake ID, told him she had a truck and a license, and had a job. 'I asked her how old she was and she said she was 18 for the longest time,' he told WMBB-TV. 'I kept asking her old she was. She kept telling me 18 almost 19. She told me she had a truck, had a license, all that good stuff.' At one point in their three-month relationship, she even told him she had been pregnant, he said. Scroll down for video . Locked up: Dalton Hayes, who fled Kentucky with his underage girlfriend at the start of January and allegedly stole multiple trucks, said that she led him to believe she was 18 - and even showed him her ID . Speaking out: Hayes, 18, spoke to WMBB from a Florida jail as he awaits extradition back to Kentucky . 'We were fighting and arguing again and she said, ""by the way I had a miscarriage, I just didn't know how to tell you"",' he said. 'And I said, ""all you had to do was just tell me something"".' But Hayes learned her real age on January 4 when she stayed at his house for the night and Phillips' father reported her missing. The couple fled - first allegedly stealing a truck in Kentucky that they drove through a cattle farm and then abandoned. They then allegedly stole another truck that they were seen driving in Manning, South Carolina, where they stopped at a Walmart. They are then believed to have stolen a third truck in Georgia, which they drove to Florida. On Sunday, the duo were found sleeping inside the stolen Toyota Tundra in an IHOP parking lot in Panama City Beach, and were taken into custody. During their crime spree, they allegedly broke into homes and were caught on surveillance in Walmart using stolen checks. 'Fooled': He said that Cheyenne Phillips, 13, told him she had a truck, jobs and a driving license . Caught: The couple were seen on CCTV in a South Carolina Walmart as they eluded authorities last week . Stopped: They were eventually found sleeping in a stolen truck in an IHOP parking lot in Florida on Sunday . When they were found in Florida, the truck had two loaded guns inside. Hayes was charged with a warrant from Kentucky for custodial interference of a minor and was booked into the Bay County Jail Sunday. On, Monday he waived his right to an extradition hearing and is now waiting to be transported back to his home state. After they were caught, Phillips' father said he didn't have a problem with Hayes. 'I don't have anything against him. I'm not upset with this boy. He's a boy. And apparently he thinks something of my daughter. He's just not thinking clearly,' Shawn Phillips said. He also denied Hayes' claims in an earlier jailhouse interview that they fled Kentucky because Phillips' family had been beating her. 'Anyone that knows us knows better. My family is pretty well respected in the community,' he said. In custody: Hayes, who faced separate burglary charges before the crime spree, now faces charges for custodial interference of a minor. He appeared in court via video link on Monday, right . The duo fled from their small Kentucky town the day before Dalton's charges in a separate burglary case was scheduled to go before a grand jury. He was facing five to ten years in jail after being charged with second-degree burglary - and he said he wanted to show his girlfriend the sea before being locked up, friends told DailyMail.com. The crime spree had started on January 3 when Phillips' mother, Sherry Phillips, picked Cheyenne up from her house near Clarkson, police said. Sherry Phillips does not have custody or visitation rights with her daughter, and police arrested her on Monday on a charge of custodial interference. She is in jail on a $50,000 cash bond and has a court hearing scheduled for Thursday morning. See below for video .","Dalton Hayes, 18, is in a Florida jail awaiting extradition back to Kentucky .

"The moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means its near side always points towards our planet. Until now, researchers have debated why this near side has an abundance of dark features - most notable by the 'man on the moon' - whereas the far side is much lighter . Scientists have revealed how the near side's proximity to the scorching young earth weakened it and made it more susceptible to asteroid impacts that caused features like this to form. The reason the moon has dark patches on the near side (pictured) that are not seen on the other side is likely due to its formation. The moon was once up to 20 times closer to Earth, and side closest is said to have been weakened by the still-hot Earth a few billion years ago . The dark areas we see on the near side, that resemble a face, appeared when meteoroids struck the Earth-facing side of the moon and created large flat seas of basalt that we see as dark areas known as maria. Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The hypothesis claims the moon is . debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and . an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The . colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek . Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. No such 'face' exists on the farside of the moon, and now Penn State University astrophysicists think they know why. 'I remember the first time I saw a globe of the moon as a boy, being struck by how different the farside looks,' said Jason Wright, assistant professor of astrophysics at the university. 'It was all mountains and craters. Where were the maria? It turns out it's been a mystery since the fifties.' This mystery is called the Lunar Farside Highlands Problem and dates back to 1959, when the Soviet spacecraft Luna 3 transmitted the first images of the far side of the moon back to Earth. Neither side of the moon is 'dark' in terms of light though - both receive sunlight as the moon completes its orbit and rotation around Earth. Researchers at the time noticed that fewer 'seas' or maria existed on the portion of the moon that always faces away from Earth. Now the scientists, reporting their results in Astrophysical Journal Letters, have realised that the absence of maria, which is due to a difference in crustal thickness between the side of the moon we see and the hidden side, is a consequence of how the moon originally formed. The mystery of the moon's varying colours has puzzled astronomers ever since the moon's far side (pictured) was seen for the first time in 1959. This image was taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) in June 2009 . The general consensus on the moon's origin is that it probably formed shortly after Earth and was the result of a Mars-sized object hitting Earth with a glancing but devastating impact. This giant impact hypothesis suggests that the outer layers of Earth and the object were flung into space and eventually formed the moon. 'Shortly after the giant impact, Earth and the moon were very hot,' said professor of astrophysics Steinn Sigurdsson, one of the contributors to the study. Earth and the impact object did not just melt; parts of them vaporised, creating a disk of rock, magma and vapor around Earth. 'The moon and Earth loomed large in each others skies when they formed,' continued graduate student and lead author of the study Arpita Roy. The geometry was similar to the rocky exoplanets recently discovered very close to their stars, said Wright. The moon was 10 to 20 times closer to Earth than it is now, and the researchers found that it quickly assumed a tidally locked position (where the same side always faces our planet) with the rotation time of the moon equal to the orbital period of the moon around Earth. The same real estate on the moon has probably always faced Earth ever since. Tidal locking is a product of the gravity of both objects. Pictured is an artist's illustration of what Earth and the moon might have looked like about four billion years ago. Note how the moon is much larger in the sky as it is up to 20 times closer than it is now, and it's near side is also subjected to the full force of the heat of the scorching young Earth . The moon, being much smaller than Earth, cooled more quickly. Because Earth and the moon were tidally locked from the beginning, the still hot Earth - more than 2500°C (4,500°F) - radiated towards the near side of the moon. The far side, away from the boiling Earth, slowly cooled, while the Earth-facing side was kept molten creating a temperature gradient between the two halves. This gradient was important for crustal formation on the moon. The moon's crust has high concentrations of aluminum and calcium, elements that are very hard to vaporise. 'When rock vapor starts to cool, the very first elements that snow out are aluminum and calcium,' said Sigurdsson. Aluminum and calcium would have condensed in the atmosphere of the cold side of the moon because the nearside was still too hot. Thousands to millions of years later, these elements combined with silicates in the moon's mantle to eventually form the moon's crust. And according to the researchers, the farside crust had more of these minerals and is thicker. The moon has now completely cooled and is not molten below the surface. But earlier in its history, large meteoroids struck the nearside of the moon and punched through the crust, releasing the vast lakes of basaltic lava that formed the nearside maria that make up the man in the moon. When meteoroids struck the farside of the moon, in most cases the crust was too thick and no magmatic basalt welled up, creating the dark side of the moon with valleys, craters and highlands, but almost no maria.","Penn State University revealed evidence for the moon's varying colour .

Scientists suggest this change is due to the moon and Earth's formation .

"The spacecraft it is hoped will take man to Mars is about to be tested for the first time. Nasa’s Orion spacecraft will take its first flight in December. Today, staff at the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Florida began the final assembly for the test. Scroll down for video . The Orion crew module for Exploration Flight Test-1 going through final preparations. In December, Orion will launch 3,600 miles into space in a four-hour flight to test the systems that will be critical for survival in future human missions to deep space. Orion is being prepared for its first launch later this year, an uncrewed flight that will take it 3,600 miles above Earth, in a 4.5 hour mission to test the systems critical for future human missions to deep space. After two orbits, Orion will reenter Earth’s atmosphere at almost 20,000 miles per hour before its parachute system deploys to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. Engineers began stacking the crew module on top of the completed service module, the first step in moving the three primary Orion elements –crew module, service module and launch abort system – into the correct configuration for launch. 'Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,' said Mark Geyer, NASA's Orion Program manager. 'Orion's flight test will provide us with important data that will help us test out systems and further refine the design so we can safely send humans far into the solar system to uncover new scientific discoveries on future missions.' With the crew module now in place, the engineers will secure it and make the necessary power connections between to the service module over the course of the week. Once the bolts and fluid connector between the modules are in place, the stacked spacecraft will undergo electrical, avionic and radio frequency tests. The modules are being put together in the Final Assembly and System Testing (FAST) Cell in the Operations and Checkout Facility at Kennedy. Here, the integrated modules will be put through their final system tests prior to rolling out of the facility for integration with the United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket that will send it on its mission. Nasa's Orion spacecraft, illustration shown, is due to complete its first unmanned test flight towards the end of this year. The spacecraft will eventually be able to take four astronauts on missions lasting at least 21 days, although this could be extended with a service module currently being researched and developed by Esa .

After two orbits, Orion will reenter Earth’s atmosphere at almost 20,000 miles per hour before its parachute system deploys to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. Orion's flight test also will provide important data for the agency’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and ocean recovery of Orion. Engineers at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, have built an advanced adapter to connect Orion to the Delta IV Heavy rocket that will launch the spacecraft during the December test. Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) during launch. The first SLS mission, Exploration Mission 1 in 2017, will launch an uncrewed Orion spacecraft to demonstrate the integrated system performance of the SLS rocket and spacecraft prior to a crewed flight. How it compares: The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today. Russia's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled. However construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway . The adapter also will be used during future SLS missions. NASA’s Ground Systems Development and Operations Program, based at Kennedy, will recover the Orion crew module with the U.S. Navy after its splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. Earlier this month Nasa began ramping up excitement for sending humans to Mars, outlining its path to the red planet, and showcasing some of the technologies that will help people get there. But as revealed in a 286-page National Research Council (NRC) report commissioned by the agency, Nasa has been warned that its efforts will be doomed to fail if it does not change its methods. The scathing assessment claims that without sufficient funding, a clear goal, or help from nations such as China, Nasa will not be capable of making the next giant leap for mankind. Nasa's 'Path to Mars' graphic sets out the steps needed to send humans to an asteroid and Mars by the 2030s . According to the NRC's report, Pathways to Exploration - Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration, the U.S. should abandon its 'flexible approach' to human missions beyond Earth, set Mars as its ultimate goal and open the door to partnerships with other partners including China. *Note: all three options assume ISS missions have been concluded . Option 1 - A 'giant leap' from moon to Mars . - Return to the moon . - Build a lunar base . - Send humans to the surface of Mars . Option 2 - Least technological risk . - Send humans into lunar orbit . - Visit an asteroid in its own orbit . - Return to the moon's surface . - Explore Martian moons Deimos and Phobos . - Enter orbit around Mars . - Land on the red planet . Option 3 - Nasa's current favoured path . - Robotically capture an asteroid . - Place it in lunar orbit for astronauts to visit . - Travel to the moons of Mars . - Place humans in Martian orbit . - Set foot on Mars . This flexible approach currently involves the construction of a heavy-lift rocket known as the Space Launch System (SLS) and a manned capsule spacecraft called Orion. Both of these are seen as necessities for future missions beyond low-Earth orbit - but as of yet neither has a solid goal beyond a few test flights leading up to 2021. The NRC recommends Nasa chooses one of three stepping-stone approaches toward Mars, that build technological know-how through a series of well-defined preliminary missions. All three options begin with the International Space Station (ISS). The station is seen as vital in testing not only technologies for long-term . space travel, but also the psychological and biological strains that will . be felt by astronauts. However, . the report claims Nasa's current plan of operating the ISS into the . next decade, possibly as far as 2028, alongside assembling the . technologies to land humans on Mars is not feasible. Continuing on this path 'is to invite failure, disillusionment, and the loss of the longstanding international perception that human spaceflight is something the United States does best,' said the NRC in its report. Two of the options then involve sending humans back to the moon, something not favoured by the Obama administration. 'I just have to say pretty bluntly here: We’ve been there before,' Obama said in 2010 when outlining Nasa's space policy for the forthcoming years. President Obama has repeatedly stated his opposition to returning to the moon (artist's illustration of a cancelled Nasa concept shown), saying we have been there before, and should instead look to do new missions such as sending astronauts to an asteroid and ultimately, of course, exploring the surface of Mars . But these paths would be less technologically daunting, NRC panel . co-chairman Jonathan Lunine of Cornell University said. One suggestion is that Nasa could follow the International Space Station program, which currently . costs the United States about £1.8 billion ($3 billion) a year, with a series of lunar . sorties - an outpost on the moon and then a mission to Mars, according to the report. The other moon-based option would follow the space station with human missions to an orbit . beyond the moon, then to an asteroid in its native orbit, then to the . lunar surface, the moons of Mars, Martian orbit and then to Mars itself. This would have the most stops en route to Mars, but poses the least . technological risk because milestones have to be met along the way, claimed the NRC. The third path . includes Nasa's current plan to robotically capture an asteroid, . redirect it into a high orbit around the moon and send astronauts there . to explore. The report suggests that the path should continue with missions to the . moons of Mars, then on to Martian orbit, and finally to the surface of . the planet.","Orion spacecraft will take its first flight in December .

"Veteran journalist Michael Usher and his crew were kept in isolation at Sydney Airport on Thursday, after flying in from Sierra Leone where they had spent a week filming a story on the Ebola virus. The five-member reporting team from 60 Minutes was detained inside the Kingsford Smith terminal at Mascot early on Thursday morning, after heading back from the assignment.

A nurse wearing personal protective equipment assists a patient at the Kenama ebola treatment centre run by the Red Cross Society in Sierra Leone . A Nine spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that they were 'being held in an isolated room while Customs and Quarantine officers undertake screening procedures'. It's understood that a medical team from the NSW Department of Health was called to the airport, to assess the 60 Minutes staff members. A Customs official confirmed the process: 'With the Ebola procedures, Customs do the initial checks on those who have been travelling in that area, and then refer them to quarantine officials and then State health personnel are brought in.' According to the network, they all had their temperatures taken and have returned normal readings. The five staff members were released just after midday, after receiving the all-clear by the Department of Health. In some circumstances, those who have been detained are required to undertake follow-up testing at home. It's unclear when Michael Usher and the rest of the 60 Minutes Australia crew will be released from isolation at Sydney Airport following an Ebola alert by officials there . Under new government provisions, introduced soon after the Ebola crisis took hold in west Africa, every passenger arriving in Australia is required to fill in a travel history card that is then reviewed by Customs. The Department of Agriculture is charged with the process of screening passengers. They told Daily Mail Australia: 'Since August 2014, bio-security officers of the Department of Agriculture have been undertaking targeted screening and assessment of international passengers entering Australia from Ebola virus disease-affected countries.' 'As part of their normal duties, bio-security officers at Australia’s air and sea ports have always looked for signs of disease that can impact human health. This is part of our role in managing Australia’s bio-security. 'All travellers arriving in Australia at an international airports and those arriving on international cruise vessels need to fill in a Travel History Card which indentifies their travel to or from an Ebola virus affected country, within in the past 21 days.' Officials said that travellers who are identified are then asked to answer a series of questions about their travel and movement history and have their temperature checked. 'If their temperature is above normal, or they are found to present a risk because of their travel history or movements, a medical practitioner will perform an additional health assessment. This assessment will occur before the traveller is able to leave the airport.'","TV Journalist and camera crew were prevented from re-entering Australia after filming in west Africa .

"A young mother told how her boyfriend kidnapped her, drove her to an abandoned quarry, made her strip naked and tied her to a tree – because she said she wanted to go home to bed. Sophie Lazell, now 26, was nearly asleep when Daniel Jones barged in to the home she shared with her mother and children and grabbed her by the hair. In front of her family, he dragged her from her bed and drove her for miles to an abandoned quarry in Hampshire. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Sophie Lazell, left, was at home in Hampshire when her boyfriend Daniel Jones, right, burst into the house . Jones, right, grabbed Miss Lazell, left, and took her to an abandoned quarry, forced her to strip and tied her to a tree before abandoning her. He was later sentenced to 20 months in prison for the terrifying kidnap . There he told her 'there's already a hole dug for you' before ordering her to strip and tying her to a tree with her pyjamas. He then drove off, leaving her freezing cold and petrified. She escaped by breaking free of her makeshift ties, hiding in a bramble bush and running through fields naked for around an hour until she found a house which was occupied by an elderly couple who called 999. Remarkably she suffered only cuts and bruises in the attack, although she has been left anxious and 'on red alert'. Speaking publically for the first time since the incident in December 2013, Miss Lazell, now living at an undisclosed location in UK, said she had spent the day with Jones, but he had become upset when she said she wanted to spend the night alone. He kept calling her so she turned her phone to silent mode and settled into bed for the night. Miss Lazell said: 'I was just nodding off when I heard a crashing noise. 'It sounded like the front door being kicked in. Then I heard Daniel, shouting. 'He said, ""Where is she, the liar?"" 'I got up and found Daniel wielding a metal bar. He had smashed the TV. He said, ""come with me"". Then my mum appeared, and my kids came out of their room.' Miss Lazell said she was disappointed by the sentence Jones received, believing that he would have been jailed for longer than 20 months . At this point Jones pulled Miss Lazell towards the front door. In a desperate bid to appease him she offered to run away with him. 'I had to calm him down,' she explained. 'I hoped all the commotion would wake a neighbour who'd call the police. But I didn't hear any sirens. 'As I was leaving I told my kids it would be all right. But I was terrified.' Jones drove Miss Lazell for 'what seemed like hours' to 'a wooded track that led to a deserted quarry.' 'He demanded I take my trousers off,' Miss Lazell – who was wearing pyjamas – said. 'He then led me to a tree, wrapped my arms around it, and tied them up with my pyjama bottoms. 'He said, ""that's what happens to whores,"" and then forced me to strip completely.' After a time he drove off and she made her escape, hiding in a ditch when she heard his car. 'I was terrified,' she said. 'I could only see horses' fields. 'There were no lights on or houses. 'I ran for my life. 'I must have been running for an hour, when I spotted a house.' The police were called and she was taken to hospital. Jones went on the run and was arrested four weeks later. But the attack had a longer lasting impact on Miss Lazell. 'Before, I'd had lots of friends and enjoyed going out on the town,' she said. 'After I didn't know who to trust and was scared to even pop out for a bottle of milk. 'I only left the house at certain times of the day when I thought town would be quiet and I was on the red alert when I did. 'I suffered anxiety attacks and had nightmares.' In July last year Jones, of Tongham, Hampshire, appeared at Salisbury Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to kidnap. Ms Lazell said that she was taken to hospital for treatment but it took police four weeks to track Jones down . Neighbours of Miss Lazell said they had heard Jones say: 'You can run Sophie, but you won't get far.' Her eldest son was heard to say: 'He's going to kill my mum.' In August, he was sentenced to 20 months in prison for kidnap, and received a five-year restraining order. Miss Lazell said: 'I'd hoped he'd get longer.' She urged other women to be alert to potential warnings of domestic abuse. 'My parents had been shocked that Daniel was capable of hurting me,' she said. I guess on the surface our relationship looked like it was going well. But before the attack he always wanted to know what I'd been up to, was accusing me of cheating. Now I want to encourage other women to leave bad relationships. 'Walk out on physically violent, emotionally and mentally abusive partners. I learnt the hard way that you shouldn't brush things under the carpet. Please, get out, before things turn ugly.'","Sophie Lazell was dragged from her home by her boyfriend Daniel Jones .

"The pregnant daughter of a millionaire was kicked in the stomach by a burglar during an armed raid on their family home. Katie Stiff was with her mother Catherine and younger sister Chloe, when a masked intruder stormed their home in Epsom, Surrey, armed with a gun. Katie's father, entrepreneur Robert, said the burglar who targeted his family was a 'coward', and had inflicted so much sadness in to their lives at a time when they should have been great joy. Scroll down for video . The pregnant daughter of millionaire Robert Stiff (pictured) was kicked in the stomach by a burglar during an armed raid on their family home . Katie Stiff was with her mother Catherine (pictured) and younger sister Chloe, when a masked intruder stormed their home in Epsom, Surrey, armed with a gun . The three women were at their home in Epsom, Surrey (pictured) when the masked-intruder broke in and ordered them to remove and handover their expensive jewellery . 'That is probably the most upsetting part, with Katie being pregnant at a time when we should have been celebrating there was so much sadness in the house,' Mr Stiff told BBC Crimewatch. 'He is a coward.' Thankfully Katie is due to give birth next month. Former soldier Mr Stiff, 54, was born in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and moved to Britain in 1978. He is a patron of the Prince's Trust and sold his healthcare recruitment company Team24, to the Capita Group, for more than £25 million in May 2011. He was at work when the masked man entered his six-bedroom gated home, close to the Kingswood Golf and Country Club, at around 5.40pm on November 12. Surrey Police, who will make a Crimewatch television appeal about the aggravated burglary tonight, said all three were also viciously kicked in their sides and it was especially traumatic for Katie who is due to give birth in February. Mr Stiff's youngest daughter Chloe (pictured) described the attack on the family as 'traumatic', but added: 'It's the after-effects of what he's left behind that's even worse' He forced the women to removed and hand over their expensive jewellery, before assaulting them and fleeing with the jewels and several watches. The family was also forced to lie down before they were tied up, and the women were ordered to open a safe where more high-value jewellery was stolen. '[The intruder] went to Katie and he booted her in the side of her tummy where she's pregnant,' said Mrs Stiff in the televised appeal. 'And he booted her one, and I just thought: ""Oh god, what's going to happen to that baby?""' Katie, seen here portrayed by an actress in the BBC Crimewatch reconstruction, is due to give birth to her first child next month . The three women were in the house together, and had been watching television when the masked man stormed their six-bedroom home . The family was also forced to lie down before they were tied up, and the women were ordered to open a safe where more high-value jewellery was stolen . Mr Stiff said the burglar who targeted his family (portrayed here by an actor) was a 'coward', and had inflicted so much sadness in to their lives at a time when they should have been great joy .

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Antony Archibald, will also feature on the programme and is appealing to anyone who has information which could assist the investigation to share this with officers. Mr Stiff is a patron of the Prince's Trust and sold his healthcare recruitment company Team24, to the Capita Group, for more than £25 million . 'This was a horrifying ordeal for the family involved, they believed they were going to come to some serious harm, it is every family's worst nightmare,' he said. 'The family's eldest daughter is expecting their first grandchild and was heavily pregnant at the time of the offence; this did not seem to affect the intruder, who kicked her and her mother and sister in the stomach even after they had given in to his demands. 'They were fully compliant throughout the incident. 'In the time which has past, I believe the offender will have confided in someone about the offence but he probably failed to mention that he violently assaulted a pregnant woman. 'If you are this person, please come forward and speak with us.' He added: 'I believe the family was specifically targeted because the burglars had very detailed demands and I am sure someone will be able to piece all of these pieces together and provide us with a name for the offender. 'I would also urge anyone who has been offered any of the stolen items for sale or who knows a person who has suddenly come into possession of such an item and has their suspicions about them to provide information. 'Someone, somewhere knows who is responsible for the appalling attack and I would urge them to contact police.'

"A fishing enthusiast has captured the moment he reeled in a huge 10 foot bronze whaler shark after a two hour stand-off on a beach. Daring Jack Jacobs described the catch as ‘a fish of a life for me’ on his YouTube channel, where he posted an eight minute snapshot of his battle with the beast. Before the shark comes into view, the fisherman is seen clinging onto his rod as a crowd gathers around him in anticipation on a beach in South Australia. Scroll down for video . Fisherman Jack Jacobs was very proud after he caught this 10ft bronze whaler shark . He spent two hours trying to catch the large beast with his special fishing rod . After hours of back and forth, the 200kg shark emerges into the shallow water after being ‘caught on a chunk of eagle ray as bait’. ‘It took several long powerful runs and led me up and down the beach,’ Jacobs said. He had been trying to catch the fish for ‘several years’ and used a custom made shark rod. In an eight minute version of his two hour challenge, a video shows him pulling the shark out of the water . His friends and spectators helped him to hold the shark still as he measured it . 'It's a whopper' he cried as he realised how large the shark was . After they'd taken its vital statistics they released the shark back into the water . In the video the rod bends under the strain of the huge shark and at one point part of it breaks off. ‘Oh my god that is a whopper,’ he shouts as the shark washes up on the beach. After tying a rope around its tail, he and a friend frantically dragged it onto the sand where they measured its credentials. ’10 ft 10 f**k yeah,’ he exclaims before dragging the shark back into the water so that it could swim off. His friend soon ran off once the shark was back in the water but Jack hung around to watch it . He filmed the shark swimming back off into the sea on the South Australian beach .","Jack Jacobs filmed the moment he caught the shark in South Australia .

"She's the Australian woman who reached inside herself and delivered her own twins during a caesarean section. Three days before Christmas, Gerri Wolfe, 41, gave birth to her 10th and 11th children, Matilda and Violet, in a very unusual procedure at John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle, New South Wales. It was to be Mrs Wolfe's fifth experience having a caesarean - but she didn't want a traditional one. Scroll down for video . Gerri Wolfe, 41, gave birth to her twins Matilda and Violet, through maternal assisted caesarean . Mrs Wolfe is used to getting what she wants. 'It's my body, it's my birth, it's my baby,' she said . She was 'devastated' when she learned she had a complication in her 36th week and would have to have a caesarean. 'My other caesareans were very sterile, very surgical, very impersonal,' she told Daily Mail Australia from her home on the Central Coast. 'People were talking about what they did on the weekend without even thinking about me laying on the table, going through this momentous experience of having a baby.' But then she recalled a procedure she had read about online - a maternal assisted caesarean. It is a typical caesarean, performed by doctors, with the only difference being the mother reaches into her belly and lifts the infant out at the end. Her OB-GYN (obstetrician-gynaecologist) was not convinced. 'No, no, no', he said. Her husband, Robert, joked that she was causing trouble. But Mrs Wolfe is used to getting what she wants. 'It's my body, it's my birth, it's my baby,' she said. First Mrs Wolfe brought Matilda up to her chest, and a minute later Violet joined her . Mrs Wolfe said it was a wonderfully personal moment - just as if she had a natural birth. 'This was much more personal,' she said . Violet and Matilda are happy and healthy and will be the Wolfe's last children . And that was the way it was. The OB-GYN changed tack after doing some research and considering her special circumstances. '(The doctor) was quite willing once he realised the risk of infection wasn't as high as he perhaps first thought,' Mrs Wolffe said. 'I came to him and said: ""This is what I need to reclaim my birth - to make it more personal for me, so I can be a good mother.' 'It was more about making it that much more personal, and for me to have a connection to the birth of my children . So on December 22, Mrs Wolfe walked into an operating theatre and 'scrubbed in' over a sink with her obstetrician. She had two pairs of elbow-length gloves placed on her arms and sat on the bed, where she had an epidural. Matilda was born at 3.04kg, while Violet was 2.54kg. Gerri stayed in hospital a week afterwards to recover . She laid down. The first set of gloves were taken off - leaving a second pair on - and she was under strict instructions not to move her arms from her chest. 'I wasn't allowed to touch anything. I wasn't allowed to move. Wasn't allowed to do anything until they had told me to. 'That way, I was completely sterile - I wasn't supposed to touch anything. 'Then (after a while) he leaned over to me and went, ""are you ready to meet these babies?"" 'I went ""oh my god!... Okay, really!""' 'It was just like a normal Caesarean from then until he said, ""reach down and grab your babies"". 'I just brought her (Matilda) up to my chest and I held her in my left arm. 'And then a minute later he said, ""come and get the other one"". Mrs Wolfe, above, is pictured being 'scrubbed up' (left). She had two pairs of gloves put on to ensure they were sterile, with the second layer peeled off (right) once she laid down . Touching moment: The parents meet their newborn babies, Violet and Matilda . Matilda and Violet are the tenth and eleventh children of Ms Wolf . The twins are now the youngest of a 'noisy and chaotic' batch of siblings - the eldest, Mitchell, is 19 - who are far from spoilt and 'very involved in the community', she said . '(Violet) was breached, so it was a little bit awkward picking her up. 'But I reached out with my right hand and someone helped me turn her around the right way and put her on my chest as well. 'And then I had both of them!' Mrs Wolfe said it was a wonderfully personal moment - just as if she had a natural birth. 'This was much more personal,' she said.

"When Russet was gifted with a delicious bone to gnaw on, little did she know the challenges she would soon face. The three-year-old English Bulldog decided to go outside to enjoy her treat one morning, but a huge obstacle stood in her way...the door flap. In this farcical video, taken by her highly amused owner, you can see just how persistent a peckish pet can be. At first, Russet is standing in front of the backdoor while she grips the center of the bone in her mouth and contemplates his next move. She decides to just go for it but finds that she's unable to fit the bone through the narrow door-flap as it keeps getting trapped in the process. After many attempts, she quickly learns that maneuvering it while its in the horizontal position is not going to work due to its width. The big challenge: Russet the bulldog struggles to fit her wide bone through the narrow door-flap..but she deserves an A for effort . So she does what any smart bulldog would do and drops the bone before leaping through the flap alone. But don't fret, she hasn't forgotten her prized possession and is hardly ready to give up so easily! The persistent pet immediately reaches her head back into the house and tries, once again, to yank the bone across from the other side to no avail. Thinking outside the box: The persistant pet tries from both sides of the flap, but alas, her attempts keep failing . Flap door? More like trap door! But, with much effort and some logical thinking, things suddenly start to click for Russet. She grabs the end of the bone with her teeth, enabling her to drag the bone through the flap sideways. Success, she's cracked the code! Let's hope she remembers his technique so she can bring the bone back home with her. Clever doggy! This position is much better and she is finally able to pull the bone outside .","Russet the bulldog is persistent in his battle with dog door .

"For the first time, ethnic minorities make up a majority of babies in the United States . Ethnic minorities now make up the majority of babies in the United States, official figures revealed today. It is the first time that this has been the case and the change reflects a growing age divide between mostly white, older Americans and predominantly minority youths that could reshape government policies. Preliminary census estimates also show the share of African-American households headed by women - made up of mostly single mothers - now exceeds African-American households with married couples, a sign of declining U.S. marriages overall but also continuing challenges for black youths without involved fathers. The findings, based on the latest government data, offer a preview of final 2010 census results being released this summer that provide detailed breakdowns by age, race and householder relationships such as same-sex couples. Demographers say the numbers provide the clearest confirmation yet of a changing social order, one in which racial and ethnic minorities will become the U.S. majority by the middle of the century. Currently, non-Hispanic whites make up just under half of all three-year-olds, which is the youngest age group shown in the Census Bureau's October 2009 annual survey, its most recent. In 1990, more than 60 per cent of children in that age group were white. Scroll down for video . Whites still make up the vast majority of older Americans - 80 per cent of the over 65s .

Johnson, a sociology professor and senior demographer at the University . of New Hampshire, noted that much of the race change is being driven by . increases in younger Hispanic women having more children than white . women, who have lower birth rates and as a group are moving beyond their . prime childbearing years. The numbers come amid public debate over . hotly contested federal and state issues, from immigration and gay . marriage to the rising cost of government benefits, that are resonating . in different ways by region and demographics. Alabama became the latest state this month to pass a wide-ranging anti-immigration law, which in part requires schools to report students' immigration status to state authorities. Age divide: The chart shows how the median age differs vastly in America, from Maine, where it's 42.7, to Alaska, where it is just 33.8. 12 of the 14 states with a median age of less than 36 are in the South and West . That follows tough immigration measures . passed in similarly Republican-leaning states such as Georgia, Arizona . and South Carolina. But . governors in Massachusetts, New York and Illinois, which long have been . home to numerous immigrants, have opted out of the federal Secure . Communities programme that aims to deport dangerous criminals, saying it . has made illegal immigrants afraid of reporting crimes to police. California may soon opt out as well. While the number of black single mothers has been gradually declining, overall marriages among blacks are decreasing faster. That reflects a broader U.S. trend of declining marriage rates as well as increases in non-family households made up of people living alone, or with unmarried partners or other non-relatives. Female-headed households make up a 19 per cent share among Hispanics and 9 per cent each for whites and Asians. Meanwhile, figures released last month revealed that the migration of young Hispanic families has fuelled the age divide between regions of America. Young Hispanic migrant families are increasingly moving into western and southern states, while older baby boomers stay put further north. The population in the South and West is now dramatically younger than in the Northeast, and there is a gap of 3.9 years between the youngest and oldest regions of the country, according to figures released by the Census Bureau. In all, 12 of the 14 states with median ages of 36 or younger are located in the South and West, including California, Colorado and Georgia, whereas 13 of the 20 states with a median age of 38 or higher are in the Midwest and Northeast, including New Jersey, Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Another intriguing recent study has revealed that college-educated immigrants now outnumber those entering the country with just a high school degree - and the variation is much bigger in urban areas. South rises: In many South states, the Hispanic population has doubled on ten years ago, with Hispanics outstripping whites for the first time in New Mexico - 46 to 40 per cent . They outnumber those educated at high school by 25 per cent in 44 major American cities - and 30 per cent of working-age immigrants now have a college degree, compared to 19 per cent in 1980. An increase in demand from U.S. employers has seen more college-educated immigrants arriving in the U.S. over the past decade than immigrants without high school education, reported Yahoo News.

"Britain is one of the most racially tolerant countries on the planet, a survey claims. The global social attitudes study claims that the most racially intolerant populations are all in the developing world, with Jordan and India in the top five. By contrast, the study of 80 countries over three decades found Western countries were most accepting of other cultures with Britain, the U.S., Canada and Australia more tolerant than anywhere else. Racism: This map shows the nations of the world where people have the most and least tolerant attitudes . The data came from the World Value Survey, which measured the social attitudes of people in different countries, as reported by the Washington Post. The survey asked individuals what types of people they would refuse to live next to, and counted how many chose the option 'people of a different race' as a percentage for each country. Researchers have suggested that societies where more people do not want neighbours from other races can be considered less racially tolerant. The country with the highest proportion of 'intolerant' people who wanted neighbours similar to them was Jordan, where 51.4 per cent of the population would refuse to live next to someone of a different race. Next was India with 43.5 per cent. Racist views are strikingly rare in the U.S., according to the survey, which claims that only 3.8 per cent of residents are reluctant to have a neighbour of another race. Diverse: The multicultural U.S. is among the least racially intolerant countries, according to the data . Other English-speaking countries once part of the British Empire shared the same tolerant attitude - fewer than five per cent of Britons, Canadians, Australians and New Zealanders showed signs of racism. People in the UK are also tolerant of other differences such as speaking a foreign language or practising an alternative religion - for example, fewer than two per cent of Britons would object to having neighbours of a different faith to them. Similarly, fewer than one in 20 people in most South American countries admitted harbouring prejudice against other races. The Middle East, which is currently dealing with large numbers of low-skilled immigrants from south Asia, seems to be a hotbed of racial tension, however. Europe is remarkably split - the west of the continent is generally more tolerant than the east, but France is a striking outlier with 22.7 per cent of the French rejecting neighbourhood diversity. Some have pointed out problems in the survey data, claiming that because the polls span a long period of time they are an unreliable guide to current attitudes. However, a more serious flaw could be the fact that in most Western countries racism is so taboo than many people will hide their intolerant views and lie to the questioners. Max Fisher of the Washington Post suggested that maybe 'Americans are conditioned by their education and media to keep these sorts of racial preferences private, i.e. to lie about them on surveys, in a way that Indians might not be'. 40% + (of individuals surveyed would not want a person of another race as a neighbour) India, Jordan . 30 - 39.9% .

President Barack Obama walks back to the Oval Office after speaking in the Rose Garden on Oct. 1, 2013 . 'We will continue to evaluate those . trips based on how events develop throughout the course of the week,' National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. Obama was originally due to leave the United States on Saturday and return a week later. Not . only must the president deal with the budget impasse and its effects, . but he faces an even bigger crunch in Congress, which will put the . United States at risk of defaulting on its debts if it does not raise . the U.S. public debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said the . United States will exhaust its borrowing authority no later than October . 17. The fight between . Obama's Democrats and the Republicans over the government's borrowing . power is rapidly merging with the standoff over every day funding, which . has forced the first government shutdown in 17 years and forced . hundreds of thousands of federal employees to take unpaid leave. The . White House announcements about the Asia trip followed a fruitless day . on Capitol Hill, with congressional Democrats and Republicans coming no . closer to resolving their differences. Obama . accused Republicans of taking the government hostage to sabotage his . signature healthcare law, the most ambitious U.S. social program in five . decades, passed three years ago.

Republicans . in the House of Representatives view the Affordable Care Act as a . dangerous extension of government power, and have coupled their efforts . to undermine it with continued efforts to block government funding. The . Democratic-controlled Senate has repeatedly rejected those efforts. The . standoff has raised new concerns about Congress's ability to perform . its most basic duties and threatens to hamper a still fragile economic . recovery. 'This is a mess. A royal screw-up,' said Democratic Representative Louise Slaughter of New York. As . police cordoned off landmarks such as the Lincoln Memorial, and . government agencies stopped functions ranging from cancer treatments to . trade negotiations, Republicans in the House sought to restore funding . to national parks, veterans' care and the District of Columbia, the . capital.

"The government has spent nearly half a million dollars studying gay hook-up apps such as Grindr. Columbia University was gifted $432,000 from The National Institutes of Health (NIH) to interview gay men about their use of GPS apps which tell the exact distance the user is from potential romantic partner. 'The overall study goal is to understand how sexual risk behaviors among men seeking men (MSM) may be facilitated by the nature of GPS-enabled smartphone applications, the way they are used, and the process by which sexual partnering occurs via smartphone applications,' reads the project description. Grindr: Columbia University was gifted $432,000 from The National Institutes of Health (NIH) to interview gay men about their use of GPS apps like Grindr which tell the exact distance away of a potential romantic partner . The study includes 60 males, 25 percent of whom are HIV positive and all of whom come from different backgrounds. 'We will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with 60 MSM (20 African American, 20 Latino, 20 White; 25% of whom are HIV-positive) who have utilized smartphone applications to meet sexual partners in the past 3 months,' explains the write-up on the NIH website. Free Beacon reports that Karolynn Siegel, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia, is the leader of the study. The app both studied the sexual arousal of men on GPS Apps such as Grindr and 'how and why smartphone applications are used for sexual partnering.' The study aims to determine how men communicate and present themselves on the site and also measures their 'emotional states and impulsivity.' The project also looked at 'smartphone-based sexual risk intervention.' Since the Grindr app was created in 2009 it is the 'most popular all-male location-based social network out there,' according to the website. Intervention: The project  looked at 'smartphone-based sexual risk intervention' as a final portion of the study . 'With more than 5 million guys in 192 countries around the world—and approximately 10,000 more new users downloading the app every day—you’ll always find a new date, buddy, or friend on Grindr,' says the site. Apps for straight people exist as well with Tinder being the most popular. The NIH has not yet funded a study on the arousal of straight dating app users and possible sexual risks. The Journal Sexually Transmitted Infections revealed study data this past summer about how both Grindr and Tinder increase the likelihood for STI's. The study found the risk is higher for those who meet people through apps than for those who meet sexual partners online or in bars and clubs. Overall, smartphone users were 23 per cent more likely to be infected with gonorrhoea and 35 per cent more likely to be infected with chlamydia. The study authors wrote: ‘Technological advances which improve the efficiency of meeting anonymous sexual partners may have the unintended effect of creating networks of individuals where users may be more likely to have sexually transmissible infections than other, relatively less efficient social networking methods.’ They added: ‘Technology is redefining sex on demand. Prevention programmes must learn how to effectively exploit the same technology, and keep pace with changing contemporary risk factors for [sexually transmitted infections] and HIV transmission.’","Columbia University was gifted $432,000 from The National Institutes of Health (NIH) to interview gay men about their use of GPS apps like Grindr .

"It was supposed to be a family night in, spent watching a DVD and munching through a bag of popcorn. But the evening they envisaged took a disturbing turn when the grandmother discovered a dead mouse festering at the pit of the popcorn packet. The grandmother-of-three, who wishes to remain anonymous, said the experience was so traumatic she will never be able to eat popcorn again. A horrified grandmother discovered this dead mouse in the £1 packet of Island Sun popping corn . The woman said finding the mouse was so traumatic she will never be able to eat popcorn again . The grandmother, who was watching the DVD with her 24-year-old son, found the dead mouse in the £1 packet of Island Sun popping corn she had purchased from the Tesco Metro in Burnt Oak, north-west London. She had eaten a portion of the popcorn and was making her way through the rest of the packet on Sunday when she saw the dead rodent at the bottom of it. The woman, who lives in Kingsbury, said: 'I have been throwing up for the last few days since I found it and have hardly been able to eat anything. 'I feel so sick, so sick to the stomach to think I made a bowl of popcorn from this bag. 'My son feels just the same. We are both totally traumatised.' The woman, who lives in Kingsbury, bought the popcorn from this Tesco Metro in Burnt Oak, Edgware . The grandmother said she had left a voicemail with Brent Council's environmental health office to report the find and is waiting for a return call. She said: 'All the packets from that store should be recalled and an investigation launched into how this happened. 'I've been unable to touch anything else that was in the cupboard alongside this packet and I will have to throw it all out when I find the courage, . She added: 'I can never eat popcorn again.' A Tesco spokesman said: 'We take complaints about products bought in our stores extremely seriously and were disappointed to hear of this incident.

"More than 100,000 people have bought ceramic poppies from the Tower of London's art installation that pays tribute to British and Commonwealth soldiers killed in the First World War. Sales of the poppies, from ceramic artist Paul Cummins' installation Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red, have raised more than £2.5million in just two days, the profits of which will go directly to six charities for servicemen and women. Today Mr Cummins, who works from his studio in Derbyshire, described the public reaction to his art, in which one poppy for each dead soldier is being placed in the dry moat at the Tower of London, as 'overwhelming'. Scroll down for video . Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red: Poppies from the installation at the Tower of London are selling fast . Each poppy is the size of a man's fist and attached to a two-foot metal stalk so it can be planted into the ground . 'I've been staggered by the response and support from members of the public,' he said.  'When I had the idea, I never imagined the reaction would be so overwhelming. 'I think that it is something everybody can relate to and they feel very personally about.' The artist had the idea for a 'sea of red' after reading the will of a Derbyshire man who joined up and died in Flanders. 'I don't know his name or where he was buried or anything about him,' said Cummins, who found the will among other old records in Chesterfield. 'But this line he wrote, when everyone he knew was dead and everywhere around him was covered in blood, jumped out at me: 'The blood-swept lands and seas of red, where angels fear to tread.' 'I believe he meant the angels to refer to his children.' Ceramic artists Paul Cummins, left, says he is 'staggered' by the public's reaction to his installation, which was visited byt the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Tuesday, right, the day it opened in London . The poppies, which are hand-sculpted and fixed to two-foot metal stalks, are currently being planted in the ground.  By Armistice Day on November 11, there will be 888, 246, each one representing a British or colonial soldier, sailor or airmen who died in the Great War. The poppies are for sale for £25, and after Armistice Day they will be removed from the ground and sent to their buyers with a certificate. Online sales only opened on Tuesday, but staff at the Tower of London say more than 100,000 poppies have sold already, and demand is growing. Stunning: Yeoman Serjeant Bob Loughlin kneels by a mass of ceramic poppies - each is being sold for £25 . General the Lord Dannatt, Constable of the Tower of London: 'We're absolutely delighted with the response from the public.' Ten per cent of the sale price, plus all profits, will go to six service charities: Combat Stress, Coming Home, Help For Heroes, the Royal British Legion, SSAFA and the Confederation of Service Charities (Cobseo). A Tower of London spokesman said: 'The charities will receive ten per cent of every poppy sold. 'However, they will also receive an equal share of the net proceeds once all costs have been recovered. 'These are costs incurred by Historic Royal Palaces and Paul Cummins Ceramics in manufacturing, transporting, installing and selling the poppies as well as VAT. 'The ten per cent donation from each poppy, combined with the net proceeds, will raise millions of pounds for the six charities if all poppies are sold,and Historic Royal Palaces and Paul Cummins Ceramics will not profit from the sale of the poppies.' Volunteers began installing the poppies on Tuesday and will continue until Armistice Day.  During this time, every night at twilight the names of 180 serving military are being read out in a roll of honour, followed by the Last Post bugle call played by a single bugler at Tower Hill terrace.","Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red is being installed at Tower of London .

"The Sydney property where an elderly woman's body lay decomposing for eight years is still empty after becoming embroiled in an ownership dispute. Natalie Jean Wood died at the age of 86 and lay unnoticed on the floor of her bedroom until her body was discovered when police searched her property in July 2011. Mrs Wood's Kippax Street property in Surry Hills was originally listed to be inherited by her sister-in-law Enid Davis, whose husband Vane, Mrs Wood's brother, died three years before the discovery of her body. The Kippax Street property in Sydney's sought after Surry Hills was originally valued in 1930 for $82,000, with properties in the suburb selling for an average price of $1,275,000 in the past twelve months . Ms Wood's tragic and lonely death was the subject of a NSW Coroner's Court inquest last year . After learning of Mrs Wood's death on the news, Allan Darley Matthews, of Bondi Junction, came forward claiming to be a cousin of Mrs Wood, though he had not seen her since he was seven years old, reported ninemsn. 'I met the deceased once in about 1936 when I was about seven years old on a family camping trip in Jibbon Beach in Bundeena NSW,' Mr Matthews said during the will proceedings for the property. Mrs Wood's father was the uncle to Mr Matthews, whose mother was his sister, making him a first cousin of the deceased and legally entitled to the million-dollar property in Surry Hills. His claim superceded Mrs Davis, until the coronial inquest into Mrs Wood's death revealed that she had died in early 2004, when both Mr Davis and his wife were still alive. State Coroner Magistrate Michael Barnes declared that Mrs Davis was the rightful inheritor of the estate of Mrs Wood, who would have turned 91 this year. The Kippax Street property in Sydney's sought after Surry Hills was originally valued in 1930 for $82,000, with properties in the suburb selling for an average price of $1,275,000 in the past twelve months. In December, On the House estimated that the property would be valued at up to $1,219,900. Natalie Jean Wood died some time after Christmas in 2003 in the bedroom (pictured) of her home in Surry Hills, Sydney, but wasn't found until police searched the property in July 2011 . These photos taken inside her home showed make-up, a watch, scissors and a 2003 diary on top of some dust-covered drawers in her bedroom . Mrs Woods reportedly did not leave a will for her property, or for her bank balance of $79,270.40. Images of the property released after he death revealed the derelict terrace where Mrs Wood lived before she passed away. The war bride and David Jones machinist was last seen on December 30, 2003 when she visited a chemist for a prescription for high-blood pressure. The box of medication was found alongside Ms Wood's belongings when her skeletal remains were found in 2011. A pair of gold earrings, a pair of reading glasses in its case, a walking stick and two pieces of clothing were also found. The photos inside her home showed make-up, a watch, scissors and a 2003 diary on top of some dust-covered drawers in her bedroom. 'That the death of a life long resident of a high density housing area should remain undiscovered until after all the flesh had rotted from her frail bones caused public disquiet,' the Coroners report read. A dust-covered walking stick and two pieces of clothing were found near where Ms Wood's remains were located when police entered the property in July 2011 . She was last seen on December 30, 2003 when she visited a chemist for a prescription for high-blood pressure. The medication was found alongside her belongings  in 2011 . Her bedroom contained two wardrobes, a mirrored dresser and a queen bed frame, but no mattress was found . Mrs Wood had lived in the house with her parents since she was born, only moving house when she was married to Douglas Wood, a naval seaman home on leave, when she was 20. She and Mr Wood moved to Melbourne, but when they divorced five years later, she returned home to live with her parents. Mrs Wood's father died in 1955, and she continued living in the house with her mother, Phyllis, ceasing work as a machinist in 1970. When her mother became ill in 1979, Mrs Wood moved them both into the house of her brother and his wife, where she remained until after her mother's death in 1992. In 1997 Mrs Wood moved back into her Kippax Street residence, which had been vacant for many years and was dilapidated from squatters use of the property in her absence. The kitchen had reportedly fallen down during the years Mrs Wood had lived with her brother and sister-in-law, and when she returned, the usable furniture and fittings were moved into the front room. There was no fridge, television, or radio in the house, and Mrs Wood's sister-in-law said that the house was fairly 'rudimentary'. A pair of gold earrings and a set of reading glasses in its case were also found . This makeshift kitchen showed dust-covered plates, a coffee cup and leftover tinned food . Photos show weathered wallpaper and fallen gyprock around the house, as well as inch thick dust, leaves and fraying carpet . Mrs Davis said she had last seen her sister-in-law in 2003, after their regular contact dwindled and Mrs Wood informed them she had a brain tumor. Mrs Davis said that she did not have time to check on Mrs Wood as her husband was terminally ill and required round-the-clock attention. In 2007 and 2008 Mrs Davis made attempts to contact Mrs Wood through enquiries to Centrelink and the police, but it was not until 2011 that Mrs Davis solicitor convinced authorities to accompany him to the Kippax Street property. When they door was opened, police discovered a 'complete human skeleton on the floor next to a bed frame with no mattress', read the coroner's report. 'The clothes the person had presumably been wearing were disintegrated around the bones. A bunched up blanket was under the skull,' it read. 'Some other bedclothes were under the legs of the skeleton. The drawers of a low sideboard were opened, partially covering the mid portion of the skeleton. Pink dentures were intermingled with skull and jawbones.' Photos show weathered wallpaper and fallen gyprock around the house, as well as inch thick dust, leaves and fraying carpet. Canned food and coffee well past its used-by-date were also located by police. In her front room, two rotting arms chairs were found alongside a two-seater lounge. Ms Wood's electricity and water providers, as well as the Department of Human Services who deposited her pension, failed to raise the alarm. The coroner ruled last year that Ms Wood's death did not require further investigations by organisations to ensure something like this didn't happen again to elderly or vulnerable clients.","Natalie Jean Wood died  after Christmas in 2003 at her Surry Hills home .

Mrs Gates was speaking as the charity she runs with her billionaire husband, Bill - the Gates Foundation - released its annual letter about its vision for the future. It claims that the lives of the poor will improve faster in the next 15 years than at any other time in history. Scroll down for video . Melinda Gates (pictured) has opened up about how deeply she is affected by charity missions abroad . Mrs Gates was speaking as the charity she runs with her billionaire husband, Bill (right)- the Gates Foundation - released its annual letter about its vision for the future . What helps drive her work for the Foundation, Mrs Gates said, are the emotions she experiences while abroad. She told The Evening Standard: 'When I am in the developing world, my heart absolutely breaks at times. I've gone back to my hotel room sobbing.' She added: 'You say ""how can I make a difference in this person's life and everybody around them?""' In their annual letter released Thursday, the couple laid out their upbeat vision for a technology-driven wave of change that will lift hundreds of millions out of poverty by 2030. The major breakthroughs will be most noticeable in health, but also in agriculture, digital banking and online education, where the Gates Foundation is planning to pour in resources.

Afghan residents beg at the side of a road in Herat. The Gates say that the lives of the poor will improve drastically in the next 15 years . 'Our big bet is that in the next 15 years, the lives of the poor are going to improve more than at any time in the history of the world,' Melinda Gates told AFP in an interview. Child deaths are predicted to be cut by half, polio will be wiped out while the fight against malaria, a major killer in Africa, will make strides with vaccines and a single-dose cure. Africa can achieve food security by 2030 with access to innovation in agriculture to help farmers, the Gates said in their letter, a vision statement that has been released annually since 2009. 'Seven out of 10 adults in Africa are farmers. When they get new seeds that are drought-resistant and as the climate changes, they can still get more yield off their farms,' said Melinda. 'It means they can feed their families and put the crops on the market.' Mobile banking has been popularized in Kenya, but the Gates Foundation is working to bring the financial tool to the poor in Tanzania, India, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Uganda. She sees potential for poverty reduction through online education and the development of software, especially for cell phones to help teachers and students. The Gates' 'big bet' that the world will be a better place in 2030 comes at a time of gloom in international circles with humanitarian agencies struggling to help a record number of people displaced by conflicts. The letter acknowledges that there are skeptics and that 'we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that a handful of the worst-off countries will continue to struggle.' But Melinda said her numerous fact-finding missions on the ground in Africa and Asia -- along with a clear faith in 'the new tools of science' -- were feeding her optimism.

She singled out Tanzania, which she has visited several times, and said it was a 'completely different' country from her first trip a decade ago, with improvements in infrastructure and other key sectors. In its campaign to bring vaccines to developing countries, the foundation has succeeded in cutting down the lag time for the life-saving medicines to reach the poor from 20-25 years to one-three years. Active in more than 100 countries, the foundation has more than $42 billion in endowments to fund projects and innovations, but the Gates said their work also focused on shaping policy with governments.

"Three GP practices in England have been put into special measures after health inspectors deemed they are providing sub-standard care to patients. The step is significant marking the first time GP surgeries have ever been subjected to the move by the Care Quality Commission. The independent health and social care regulator said: 'It is the first time, and it is significant.' The special measures, which come with help and support from officials, are a six-month warning for improvements to be made. If steps are not taken to improve care to patients at the surgeries in Liverpool, Sale and Caversham, the CQC has the power to review the practice's registration, or ultimately, call for the practice to be shut down. Three GP practices have been placed in special measures by the Care Quality Commission. It is significant as they are the first GP surgeries ever to be subjected to the measure. Dharmana's Family and General Practice, right, run by Dr Srinivas Dharmana, left, is one of the three currently receiving extra help to improve . Professor Nigel Sparrow, the CQC's senior national GP adviser, said: Patients should be able to expect high quality and consistent care from every GP practice. 'Where we have required improvement, we will expect the practice to take the necessary steps to address the issue, and we will return at a later date to check that those improvements have been made. 'Three of the five practices, which have been rated inadequate have been placed into special measures and have been offered a package of support by NHS England to help them improve. 'The other two practices have been told they will be put into special measures if they fail to improve.' The first of the three practices placed into special measures are Dharmana's Family and General Practice run by Dr Srinivas Dharmana in Walton, Liverpool. Inspectors rated the surgery inadequate for being safe, effective, caring, responsive and well-led. The second, Norris Road Surgery run by Dr Michael Florin in Sale, Trafford, was rated inadequate for being safe and well-led. The surgery was seen as being good at caring for patients but needs improvement to be considered responsive and effective. Meanwhile The Priory Avenue Surgery in Caversham, Reading, was the third, also rated as inadequate for being safe, effective and well-led. The CQC said it also needs improvement to be considered caring and responsive. Two other practices have been warned they will be placed in special measures if they fail to improve. Three GP surgeries in England have been placed into special measures after CQC inspectors deemed the service they provide inadequate. They are: . Two more practices have been rated inadequate and warned if they fail to improve they will be placed into special measures. They are: . They were named as those surgeries run by Dr Sunil Srivastava, Richmond Medical Centre in Leeds, and the Widdrington Medical Practitioners in Widdrington, Northumberland. The Leeds practice is inadequate for being safe, effective, responsive and well-led and needs improvement to be caring while the Northumberland GP was deemed as inadequate for being safe and well-led. It was rated as good at being caring, responsive and effective. Patients registered with any of the practices put into special measures were told not to worry. Help is being provided by NHS England and the Royal College of GPs (RCGP) and aims to ensure there are no immediate risks to patient safety. NHS England's deputy medical director Dr Mike Bewick said: 'General practice is the bedrock of the NHS and it's pleasing that the majority of practices inspected are rated good, with some rated outstanding. 'These inspections are about ensuring that every patient, anywhere across the country, receives consistently high quality services by identifying issues so improvements can be made. 'And for those in special measures that need extra support, we are working with the GPs, Local Medical Committees and CCGs (Clinical Commissioning Group) to help turn the affected practices around, including the offer of additional support from the RCGP.' The CQC began inspecting the 8,500 GP practices in England last October. They are all judged on five categories - according to whether they are safe, caring, effective, responsive and well-led - and rated as outstanding, good, requiring improvement or inadequate. Of the 143 it has rated so far, six have been outstanding, 112 have been good, 20 have been judged to require improvement and five, including the three now in special measures, have been ruled 'inadequate'. The Specialist Health Services (SHS) directors, who manage the Priory Avenue Surgery, accepted that they 'still need to put further work into improving the running and organisation' of the practice. They wanted 'to reassure patients that patient care remains our top priority' and they would be 'redoubling our efforts' to improve under the watchful eye of NHS England (South Central), the North and West Reading CCG and the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP). Five practices in total have been found to be inadequate since CQC inspectors began the process of rating each of the 8,500 GP practices in England. So far 143 have been inspected (file picture) In a statement they said: 'We know that continuity of care is important to our patients and that improvements to our processes will help improve the running of the practice, so we ask that patients please continue to support us and please speak to us about any concerns they may have.' The SHS directors said they had taken over a practice with many challenges but counted patients being seen on the same day if needed, introducing legionella testing and reviewing infection control processes along with increasing the number of GP sessions available among the signs that it has made progress. Trafford Clinical Commissioning Group, which provides support and advice to primary care in Trafford, said of Dr Florin's surgery: 'Patients can be assured that the CCG is working with relevant agencies, including NHS England, to support the practice during the next six months and will ensure that the population of Sale receives locally delivered GP services which meet the required standard. 'In the meantime, patients of Norris Road Surgery can, during the period of special measures continue to receive their care at Norris Road Surgery in the same way.' A spokeswoman for Dr Dharmana said they did not want to comment. The British Medical Association (BMA) raised concerns at the CQC naming and shaming the five practices. Chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said: 'It is encouraging that the vast majority of inspection reports returned good or outstanding ratings for GP practices. 'This does demonstrate that GP practices across the country are delivering high quality, responsive care to their patients despite the incredible workload and funding pressures that GP services are facing. 'However, we remain concerned at the way the CQC continues to name and shame in public the small number of practices that the CQC deems to be having problems. 'While any issues with patient care must be immediately resolved, it is not helpful that the CQC continues to pursue an inspection regime that is flawed in many aspects. 'For example, it is absurd that judgments are being made before physical inspections take place on a number of questionable indicators such as how many internal meetings a practice holds. 'We really must strive for a more robust and fair approach that maintains patient care while at the same time supporting and helping those practices that are struggling.'","First time the CQC has ever placed GP surgeries into special measures .

'They wouldn't have signed up for a taxidermy class if they hated the idea of working with a deceased specimen. 'I think the most common reaction I get is that the process isn't as gross as students initially anticipate.

"An Australian expat living in France has posted a step-by-step guide for making Vegemite pizza. To cater for her British husband, the woman’s version of the pizza features one half Australian Vegemite and one half British Marmite . The recipe was created by restaurant chain Pizza Hut, who launched the quintessentially Aussie pizza this week in anticipation for Australia Day. Scroll in down for video . An Australian expat living in France has posted a step-by-step guide for making Vegemite pizza, a recipe introduced by Pizza Hut for Australia Day. To cater for her British husband, the woman’s version of the pizza features one half Vegemite and one half Marmite . The step-by-step photographic guide was posted on Imgur on Friday by user littlemissbossy. Throughout the post, the woman takes some subtle stabs at the British spread, which she labels 'Vegelite'. In one caption she writes: ‘Marmite was a lot easier to spread, but ease does not = superiority.’ 'Obviously, the Vegemite half was the better but I'll admit, the Marmite half wasn't too bad,' she writes in another. The description for the post reads:‘I'm Australian and live in France, so couldn't try the Vegemite stuffed crust pizza. Not to worry, I made my own!' My other half is English, so to stop him being a whining Pom I conceded that his half could have Marmite (aka Vegelite).’ Throughout the post, the woman takes some subtle stabs at the British spread, which she labels 'Vegelite' 'Obviously the Vegemite half was the better but I'll admit, the Marmite half wasn't too bad,' she writes in one caption . Pizza Hut’s Vegemite stuffed crust pizza has made a nationwide splash this week in time for Australia Day, with some embracing the true-blue meal and others turning up their nose in disgust. A promotional video for the pizza was released this week which features foreigners in a Sydney hostel tasting the Mitey Stuffed Crust. Not surprisingly, travellers from Spain, The Netherlands, France and Chile were appalled by the acquired taste, endeavouring to figure out exactly what they had just eaten. 'Medicine? Petrol? Fish jam?' the men of the group ask as they appear to be fighting the urge to vomit. Two men from Chile are persistent that the Vegemite is fish jam, claiming that the substance is 'horrible'. The video has had more than 110,000 views since it was uploaded on Monday. In a promo for the new pizza, Pizza Hut took to Noah's Backpackers at Bondi Beach to carry out a taste test on non-Australians .

"Architect Phil Jones, 68, who was left unable to speak, read or write following a stroke, has learned how to communicate by drawing plans of houses . An architect who was paralysed by a stroke has learned to communicate again in the only way he can remember - by drawing plans of houses. Phil Jones, 68, from Penzance, was left unable to speak, read or write and also lost movement down his right hand side following the brain haemorrhage - which led to the stroke - in 2005. But he has since developed a unique method of interacting with his wife Deana using the architect's eye that he developed during his career. Right-handed Mr Jones uses his left hand to drawn plans of their home to get his point across and direct his wife to what he needs. If Mr Jones wants some fruit from the kitchen he starts by drawing a plan of his house, working down towards the kitchen where the fruit bowl is. And if he wants to go outside, he will draw an image of the couple's garden, using a series of lines. Mrs Jones, 56, says it can take all day to work out what he wants and that it recently took from the morning to the evening to discover he wanted a banana. His wife says simple conversations can last all day, but that she has been amazed at what her husband has been able to achieve. She said: 'When he had his stroke he was also hit with aphasia, a condition that affects a person's ability to speak, read, or write. He now has to draw with his left hand. 'But it didn't take away his ability to see things as architects do, that bird's eye view. 'If, for example, Phil wants some fruit, it would be too hard for him to just draw this because of the aphasia so he would draw a map of the house and focus on the kitchen and work down through the drawn plans to the core of what he wants. 'We might start a conversation in the morning and not finish until later in the day because it is hard work to know what he is saying, but we stick with it.' She added: 'He loves to be out in the garden and will also draw the plan of that when he wants to go there. 'He still has the architect's eye when he is out there as well, although he cannot do any of the physical work. 'It has been life changing. We are so lucky that his career before his stroke was what it was. He loved it and it is what is helping him live a better life. The couple only met one year before Mr Jones's stroke, which left the then fit and active 58-year-old in hospital for six months. Right-handed Mr Jones uses his left hand to drawn plans of their home to get his point across and direct his wife Deana (left) to what he needs . Mrs Jones said simple conversations can last all day, but that she has been amazed at what her husband has been able to achieve . Mrs Jones said: 'I am so proud of Phil. We met dancing, which he can't do any more but he still loves music. 'This is just the life journey that we are on. It is different from where we started but there is always a way forward.' Mr Jones worked as an architect for 35 years in the Bristol branch of real estate company King Sturge. His job involved drawing up plans for colleges, schools, warehouses, homes and offices, for projects all over the UK. The couple married 18 months after Mr Jones's stroke. They have no children but Mrs Jones has four from a previous marriage and one grandchild. If Mr Jones wants some fruit from the kitchen he starts by drawing a plan of his house, working down towards the kitchen where the fruit bowl is. Likewise, if he wants to go outside, he draws the couple's garden . Despite his dehibilitating stroke ten years ago, Mr Jones can now draw a series of simple sketches . She said: 'Although he has to do the drawings with his left hand, you can still see the architect plans in everything he does. 'I don't have any real knowledge of buildings - but that is the language he talks so we have made it work. 'His language is extremely limited. It can be very difficult - a bit like the Guess Who game at times.' Talking about the stroke, Mrs Jones said: 'Our lives changed overnight. He was on the floor in the bedroom and had been there for 12 hours before an ambulance got to him. That was why he was so badly affected as there was no early intervention. 'Phil had no communication at all. He lost every form of understanding. He could not walk, talk or move. 'He was in hospital for six months and even when he came home communication was virtually impossible. 'I initially tried all sorts of different programmes as I had worked in schools for children with disabilities. But nothing worked. It was all down to how Phil's brain was switched on. 'Communicating through the drawings just evolved I guess. It was probably about three years after his stroke that we discovered it. He had to learn to wash, shave and do every basic thing again. 'It was like he was a new-born. But we got to the point where we developed an understanding of how to communicate with sketches. 'I think he had been trying to do it for a while. But my acceptance of it was the big breakthrough. He had retained his skills as an architect. It was such a part of him that he never lost it.' Victoria Sadler from the charity Connect that supports stroke and aphasia sufferers, said Mr Jones's achievements were remarkable. She said: 'People with aphasia have full comprehension but can't communicate, which is very frustrating and isolating. 'Phil communicates beautifully by drawing pictures, the most beautiful and precise pictures. His achievements are mammoth and we are all very proud of him.'","Phil Jones, from Penzance, could not speak, write or read after 2005 stroke .

"Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said today he intends to run for reelection next year in spite of a New Year's Day accident that left him with four broken ribs and severe damage to his right eye. Reid will undergo surgery his eye next week. Today he revealed his eye is so weak he hasn't been able to read regularly and has instead had to listen to audio books. 'As some of you know, I'm an avid reader. Read lots and lots of books, even some good ones during the break,' Reid told reporters today during his first media availability since he was injured. 'I have not been able to read. They have told me if you have an eye that's healing and you try to overwork your good eye, it puts too much pressure on it.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . BACK ON HIS FEET: Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid arrives at a news conference today on Capitol Hill. Reid came back to work on Tuesday but didn't sit down with press until this afternoon . Reid will undergo surgery on his right eye next week. Today he revealed his eye is so weak he hasn't been able to read regularly since his New Year's Day accident and instead has had to listen to audio books . Reid said he's 'quite enjoyed' listening to audio books. 'I never thought I would,' he added. 'So I've finished a couple books that way.' 'I spend a lot of time with my staff...on the telephone, I have staff meetings at my home,' he noted. 'My daughter's been visiting with me. I've got a son coming this weekend. So I'm doing fine.' An avid exerciser, Reid suffered the eye injury as well as broken ribs when an exercise band he was using broke on Jan. 1 and sent him smashing into cabinets at his Nevada home. The eye surgery is a 'necessary step to assist in recovering full vision', his office said, adding he was expected to be released from the Washington, D.C. hospital quickly following the operation. Reid will need to remain at his D.C. home for several days to minimize strain on the injured eye. The Nevada senator told reporters today that during the procedure, doctors would remove a bone from his face so that they can drain the blood that's backed up around his eye. 'They’re going to have a reconstruction of that bone there,' he said, pointing to his face, according to Politico. 'They’re going to drain the blood off the front part of the eye, the back part of the eye. And they’re confident I’ll be really quite good about that.' Reid indicated that he may sue the maker of the exercise equipment he was using if he finds out it was defective. 'Let’s say if I were, I wouldn’t be broadcasting it,' he told reporters. The 75-year-old was not in his office yesterday, although on Tuesday he made his first appearance in the Capitol since the accident. Reid said doctors would 'drain the blood off the front part of the eye, the back part of the eye' in his surgery. 'And they’re confident I’ll be really quite good about that.' The Nevada Democrat has said the injuries won't prevent him from running for a sixth term next year, and his office has worked hard to emphasize that he is continuing to work while he's been recuperating. It released a photo of Reid meeting at his Washington home with other members of the Democratic leadership, the first week of the new Congress. 'I’ve been heavily involved in everything that’s gone on on the floor. There’s been no surprises for me,' Reid said today. His office said in a statement announcing the eye surgery that 'he will continue to maintain a busy schedule next week as his right eye heals'. Reid's office also posted a Twitter photo of him sitting at his desk in his Senate office on Tuesday. Today the Nevada senator affirmed that he would run for reelection in 2016. ''We have quite an operation in Nevada that hasn’t lost a step. We’re off and running,' he said. 'This question was asked before the break, and I’m answering it the same way. I plan on running.' Reid was off crutches by today's press avail, though he said he's still taking Tylenol to help him cope with the pain. Asked by a reporter how his ribs are, the former boxer said: 'How are my ribs? They’re so meaningless it’s hard to believe.'","Senator Harry Reid will undergo eye surgery to help recover full vision .

"A baby orangutan is fighting to overcome his appalling encounter with humans which saw him caged in a chicken coop and fed on condensed milk for virtually the whole of the ten months he has been alive. Named Budi, the milk provided virtually no nourishment for him, causing his bones to become malformed in his tiny body. And vets from a British animal welfare charity nursing him back from the brink of death say he cried like a human baby when he was rescued in Indonesia from his hellish life as a family pet. Scroll down for video . Budi (pictured) sleeps on a makeshift bed alongside his orangutan and Angry Bird soft toys . Budi the baby orangutan (pictured) was kept in a cage for the first 10 months of his life . His bones are now malformed after he was fed only with condensed milk by his former owner . 'No living creature should be forced to live in excruciating pain and misery for months on end – least of all a helpless baby orangutan with no loving mother to comfort him,' said Alan Knight OBE, the CEO of International Animal Rescue charity based in Uckfield in East Sussex. 'Budi was kept in a chicken cage by his owner and fed on nothing but condensed milk. During that time she didn't give him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him. 'He was deprived of all the nutrients that are vital to the development of a young baby. His owner's ignorance and neglect were killing him slowly and painfully. 'It breaks my heart to think of the pain Budi was in as he became more and more sick. Eventually his owner told the authorities that she wished to hand over the small baby orangutan she was keeping as a pet.' By this time he was in a pitiful state. 'His little body was bloated with fluid from severe malnutrition and his limbs were swollen and bent. He was completely unable to move or even sit up on his own. At more than a year old he should have been strong enough to climb and swing: instead he was as helpless as a newborn baby. 'When our team lifted Budi out of his cage in Kubing in Borneo to prepare him for the journey to our rescue centre ten hours away in Sungai Awan, his eyes literally filled with tears and he cried in agony. 'Everyone was distressed beyond words to see how much pain he was in. I don't know how much longer he could have endured so much suffering.' It was touch and go whether Budi would survive the journey. IAR vets made him as comfortable as possible and medicated him to try to relieve his suffering. But the little fighter made it and is now, slowly, getting stronger by the day. IAR director Karmele L Sanchez, leading the team that is nurturing Budi, said: 'Since being admitted to our centre just a few weeks ago he has started to make a slow recovery. Budi receives a helping hand from a staff member at International Animal Rescue after being saved from the chicken coop he was kept in at a small village in Borneo . When rescued, Budi (pictured) was bloated from severe malnutrition and his limbs were swollen and bent . 'He is suffering from severe anaemia and, as you can see from the photos, months of malnutrition have left his joints swollen and badly deformed. He is being treated for a serious metabolic disease that may have caused permanent damage to his bones. 'I would like to reassure you that Budi's life is no longer in danger but he is still very weak and it is too early to say what long term damage he may have suffered during his months of starvation and captivity. The treatment and care he receives in the months ahead are going to be critical to Budi's future. 'In spite of all he has suffered, he is fighting very hard to survive. It's remarkable that such a small, vulnerable creature can show so much spirit and such a strong will to live. 'He is old enough to be climbing in the trees, but at this point he can only sit up on his own for short periods, and cannot fully move his arms or legs. However with good nutrition, supplements and therapy from the medical team, we hope he will continue to improve.' Alan Knight has called upon MailOnline readers to donate money if they can to help pay for his treatment. He added: 'Budi's story is a particularly sad and distressing one I know. But please rest assured that he is receiving expert treatment and care at our centre and with your help now stands the best chance of recovery.' Orangutans are under threat in their natural habitat like never before. The lowland forest habitats of Asia's only great ape are quickly disappearing, being cut down for timber or burned to make way for palm oil plantations and other agricultural development. Orangutans are an easy target for hunters, killed for food in some areas or in revenge attacks when they move into agricultural areas and destroy crops. Females in particular are most often hunted. When caught with offspring, the young are often kept as pets by ignorant owners with no idea of their needs.","Baby ape was left fighting for his life after being kept in a chicken coop .

"High street chain Argos has been accused of racism after selling black and Asian dolls for £10 less than the white version of the children's toy. The store has been branded 'unacceptable' for pricing a white doll, called 'Maria', at £34.99 - £10 more than black doll 'Naima' and Asian doll 'Yang'. Mother-of-three Lisa O'Reilly, from South Killingholme, Lincolnshire, complained to the retailer after noticing the pricing difference while shopping for her two-year-old daughter Darcy. Argos has been branded 'unacceptable' for pricing a white toy doll, called 'Maria' (pictured), at £34.99 - £10 more than black doll 'Naima' and Asian doll 'Yang'. The 12-inch dolls are made by French firm Corolle Calin . Mother-of-three Lisa O'Reilly, from South Killingholme, Lincolnshire, complained to the retailer after noticing the pricing difference while shopping for her two-year-old daughter Darcy. Pictured: Black doll 'Naima' The 12-inch dolls, designed for children aged 18 months and above, are made my French firm Corolle Calin. They are described on the maker's site as having 'cuddly soft beanbag bodies, sleeping eyes and supple vinyl skin that is delicately scented with vanilla'. Mrs O'Reilly, 32, condemned the pricing difference by Argos and said there's 'enough prejudice in the world already without battling against racist toys'. She told The Sun's Emer Martin, Rob Pattinson and Sam Christie: 'It's unacceptable for children to think white is better or more desirable. 'It's wrong for our youngsters to grow up thinking non-white skin colours are worth less.' According to the newspaper, Argos has since sent an apology email to Ms O'Reilly which said: 'I am sorry to read that you are offended by the price difference between the Maria, Yang and Naima Corolle Calin Dolls and I can assure you that Argos would never intentionally upset or offend our customers in any way.' A spokesman for the store told MailOnline today that the mix-up was a 'genuine online pricing error'. In a statement, he said: 'As a responsible retailer, Argos strongly refutes any suggestion of discrimination with the pricing of the Corolle Calin dolls. 'A genuine online pricing error led to one of the dolls being advertised at an incorrect price. 'This error is being amended today and all three dolls are now priced at £24.99. 'We apologise for any confusion caused.' However, as of 9am today the prices still varied on the retailer's website. Mrs O'Reilly, 32, condemned the pricing difference  and said there's 'enough prejudice in the world already without battling against racist toys'. Argos has blamed  a 'genuine pricing error'. Pictured: Asian doll 'Yang' The Corolle Calin dolls could be found at varying prices on Argos' website, prompting an official complaint . It is not the first time children's toys have been at the centre of a racism row. In 2013, Lego was accused of racism by the Turkish community over a Star Wars toy allegedly depicting a mosque. The critics claimed that the Jabba's Palace model, part of Lego's Star Wars range, was offensive to Muslims because it resembled the Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul - one of the world's most renowned mosques. Members of the Turkish Cultural Community of Austria group also accused the toy manufacturer of depicting Asians as having 'deceitful and criminal personalities'. At the time, outraged Muslims criticised the toy producer, accusing it of deliberately placing contextual errors in the toy. Lego responded by confirming that the Lego set was based on the home of Jabba the Hutt, a central character in the Star Wars series, who lives in a domed palace, with a separated watchtower. In 2013, Lego was accused of racism by the Turkish community over a Star Wars toy allegedly depicting the Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul. Critics claimed that the Jabba's Palace model was offensive to Muslims . It was said that the Jabba's Palace model, part of Lego's Star Wars range, was offensivebecause it resembled the Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul (pictured) - which is one of the world's most renowned mosques . At the time, a spokesman said: ‘The Lego Star Wars product Jabba´s Palace does not reflect any actually existing buildings, people, or the mentioned mosque. 'The Lego mini-figures are all modelled on characters from the movie. 'We regret that the product has caused the members of the Turkish cultural community to come to a wrong interpretation, but point out that when designing the product only the fictional content of the Star Wars saga were referred to.' And in 2010, The Early Learning Centre ditched the pig from its HappyLand Goosefeather Farm toy set after it upset some customers. At the time, the store said the farm animal was removed from the set following ‘customer feedback’ and ‘religious reasons’. In some religions, pigs are seen as unclean. In 2010, The Early Learning Centre removed the pig from its HappyLand Goosefeather Farm toy set over fears it would upset customers because of 'religious reasons'. It later did a U-turn and put the farm animal back in . However, just days later, the retailer did a U-turn and agreed to bring back the pigs after disappointed families complained. Writing on an online fourm, one mother said: ‘I’m a Muslim and it doesn’t bother me. It is just another animal. What is the store going to do next? Ban the Peppa Pig cartoon? Ban books with pigs in?’ The Early Learning Centre later released a statement which said: ‘We have taken the decision to reinstate the pigs and will no longer sell the set in international markets where it might be an issue.’","Argos accused of racism after selling black and Asian dolls for £10 less .

"The company which owns Three - which in turn has bought O2 - is controlled by Li Ka-Shing (pictured) He is the Hong Kong billionaire behind the £10billion bid for mobile phone giant O2. But despite being known as ‘Superman’ to his associates, very few people in Britain have heard of Li Ka-Shing – even though he has been quietly buying up many of our biggest assets for years. With a £22billion personal fortune, the 86-year-old owner of the Hutchison Whampoa corporation has been Asia’s richest tycoon for almost two decades. Now his latest deal – to snap up O2 and its 24million customers from Spanish owners Telefonica – will cement his position as one of Britain’s biggest investors. From chemist chain Superdrug to Felixstowe Port, his investments stretch across almost every area of British life. One quarter of UK homes receive gas through pipes owned by one of his two gas companies. And almost 30 per cent of British residents get electricity delivered through UK Power Networks, the power grid that covers London and the South East. Mr Li already owns mobile company Three, which boasts eight million UK customers. A deal to buy O2 would catapult the company to become the largest mobile firm here, overtaking EE. Described as the ‘ultimate rags to riches’ story, Mr Li was born in 1928 in a coastal city in southeast China. He fled to Hong Kong with his family in 1940 when the Japanese army invaded. His father, a teacher, later died of tuberculosis because the family was too poor to afford treatment. With a £22billion personal fortune, Mr Li has been Asia’s richest tycoon for almost two decades . Li (pictured with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2003) has a personal fortune of around £22billion . Mr Li, aged just 15 and suffering from early symptoms of the disease, had to provide for his family. He found a job in a plastics factory and worked 16 hours a day until he had enough money to start his own business. With a loan of £4,300 scraped together from family members, he opened a plastic flower factory on the northern island of Hong Kong. One of his earliest entries in the UK market was Hutchison's £3.6 billion investment to buy a licence for the Three mobile phone network in 2000. In 2002 he bought Superdrug and a number of other European stores from Dutch retailer Kruidvat Beheer for £830 million. The billionaire also holds a number of infrastructure holdings such as Northumbrian Water, which he bought in 2011 for £2.4 billion. He also has investments in Southern Water, Wales and West Utilities, UK Power Networks, and Thamesport and Harwich ports. Some 13 years later he married a distant cousin Amy Chong Yuet-ming, whose wealthy manufacturing family had helped to put together part of the loan. From there he bought up property on the island shortly after the Communist riots of 1967, believing that the slump in property prices would be short-lived. His turning point came in 1979 when HSBC sold him Hutchison Whampoa, then a mid-sized conglomerate that owned many of the prime ports in Hong Kong. The deal, which was allegedly financed by HSBC itself and led to Mr Li joining the company’s board, catapulted him into the premier league of global investors. These assets allowed him to accumulate vast wealth and grow an international business empire using Hutchison Whampoa as a vehicle to buy and sell companies, ports, land and infrastructure. His empire now has operations in more than 50 countries and employs almost 300,000 staff. Of his latest venture, some analysts fear the mobile phone tie-up could reduce competition. Telecoms expert Matthew Howett at research firm Ovum said: ‘The biggest concern will be the impact on consumers, particularly at the lower end of the market.’ The deal will still need to be cleared by competition authorities in Brussels. In May 2013, constructions worker plastered China's Jilin province  with posters mocking Li Ka-Shing, who they claimed hadn't paid them a year's wages . In response, Hutchinson Whampoa claimed they handed their wages over to a local contractor whose duty it was to pay the workers . Li Ka-Shing was awarded the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy for reportedly donating over $1billion to charity .","Three - owned by Hong Kong's richest man - has bought O2 for £10billion .

"'We need to reinvent our whole system of life': U.S. billionaire Jeff Greene, 60, with his wife Mei Sze . A U.S. billionaire who made his fortune betting against sub-prime mortgage securities has told Americans to lower their expectations so they have 'less things' in life. Jeff Greene made his remarks after flying into Switzerland on a private jet with his 19-year younger wife, Mei Sze, children and two nannies. The businessman, 60, who is worth around $3billion through his investments and real estate development projects, said: 'America's lifestyle expectations are far too high and need to be adjusted so we have less things and a smaller, better existence. 'We need to reinvent our whole system of life.' The 60-year-old founder of Florida-based Florida Sunshine Investments was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He said he was due to attend several private parties during the week, including a dinner with former British Prime Minster Tony Blair. In an interview with Bloomberg, he said the U.S. faces a jobs crisis that will cause social unrest and extreme politics. He added: 'Our economy is in deep trouble. We need to be honest with ourselves. 'We've had a realistic level of job destruction and those jobs aren't coming back.' Mr Greene was in the news just last week as his sprawling Beverly Hills compound 'Palazzo di Amore' hit the market with a $195 million asking price - making it the highest listing currently on the U.S. market. Mr Greene and his wife were married at the property with Mike Tyson acting as his best man. Oliver Stone and Donald Sterling looked on, according to a New York Times article at the time. It is not clear what plane Mr Greene used to fly into the conference. Scroll down for video . Jet set: The Greene family all flew over to attend the Davos conference this week despite Mr Greene's calls for a smaller and better existence for Americans . 'Less things': Property developer and investor Jeff Greene said America should rethink its high lifestyle expectations after arriving by private jet to Davos . Reinvention? Mr Greene is currently selling the sprawling $195million estate where he married his wife Mei Sze, who is 19 years his junior. Mike Tyson, one of his 'best friends' served as best man . In 2013, he spoke of owning a $2million Cessna Caravan seaplane that he said saved him valuable time commuting between his homes in Palm Beach and the Hamptons and New York where he conducts much of his business. He told The Real Deal that the plane cut a journey of more than three hours to just 35 minutes, employing two full-time pilots.

Around 1,700 private flights are predicted over the course of the week, a five per cent rise on last year for the 2014 forum - a figure that will surprise many given that global warming is on the agenda and a private jet burns as much fuel in one hour as a car does in a year.

"A Virginia lawmaker who was just re-elected despite being jailed for a sex scandal with a teenager has been indicted on four new felony charges. The forgery and perjury indictment of Del. Joseph D. Morrissey was returned the day before that election and unsealed Wednesday in Henrico County Circuit Court. The lawmaker now stands accused of forging a document he vouched for in court, and persuading the girl's mother to swear to its authenticity as well. That woman, Deidre Warren, also was indicted on perjury and forgery charges. Morrissey faces up to 10 years on each count if convicted, special prosecutor William J. Neely said. Still working: Del. Joe Morrissey, a Demcrat from Henrico, watches the proceedings during the House of Delegates session Wednesday at the Capitol in Richmond. He's currently spending nights in jail over a sexual affair with a 17-year-old receptionist. He's now charged with lying to cover up the affair . Morrissey, an attorney known as 'Fighting Joe' since his 1993 courthouse fistfight with another lawyer, said the charges are false and vowed to beat them. 'This is a very harmful and mean-spirited blow, but I'll do what I've always done. I'll prevail,' Morrissey told reporters after arriving at the Capitol for the legislative session soon after the indictments were unsealed. Also charged: Deidre Warren, mother of the teen Morrissey is jailed for his affair with, allegedy swore to a forged document's authenticity at Morrisey's behest . Morrissey is spending nights in jail for contributing to the delinquency of a minor but is allowed out each day on work release, earning a day of 'good time' credit reducing his six-month sentence for each day he serves in the legislature. He accepted the misdemeanor conviction to avoid trial on charges of taking 'indecent liberties' with a 17-year-old, child pornography and soliciting a minor — felonies that could have put him in prison for decades and caused the automatic loss of his legislative position. After his conviction, the four-term Democrat announced his resignation under pressure from his colleagues and then angered them by running as an independent in the special election called to choose his successor. He won that election last week, defeating a Republican and a Democrat just before the start of the General Assembly session. Technically the most junior member of the House because of his resignation and re-election, Morrissey has been moved to a desk in a far corner of the chamber. His colleagues largely ignore him. House Speaker William J. Howell stripped Morrissey of his committee assignments, and legislative leaders from both parties are debating whether to censure or expel him. 'This is a truly painful and embarrassing chapter for the oldest continuously operating legislative body in the New World,' Howell said after learning of the new charges. 'The House will evaluate these new indictments as it pertains to disciplinary action.' Morrissey, 57, has denied having sex with Myrna Pride, who worked as a receptionist in his law office at the time. The young woman's sisters and father said they got suspicious after finding a nude photo and an exchange of sexually explicit text messages on her phone. They tracked Morrissey and Pride from a restaurant one night in August 2013, and then called police, who found the teenager inside his home at midnight. Bright future: Morrissey resigned his House of Delegates seat after prosecutors accused him of having sex with a 17-year-old girl. While serving a six-month jail term for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, he ran as an independent in a special election and reclaimed his seat . Pride — now 18 and pregnant — also has denied having sex with Morrissey, a bachelor who has fathered three children with three different women. But she said in a broadcast interview last week that she still cares and worries about him as a friend. The Associated Press usually does not disclose the names of alleged sex crime victims, but Pride has gone public with her side of the story. Morrissey claimed that Pride came to his home that night in August 2013 not to have sex, but to get his legal help recovering child support from her father, Coleman Pride. Neely said Morrissey presented a document in court last month to support this version. It appears to be a court order showing that Coleman Pride had agreed to pay $50 a month into a college fund for his daughter. But Neely said there is no court record of any child support order, and that the document 'appears to be a fabrication.' Police searched Morrissey's law office the day before the election for evidence related to the document, the same day the indictments were filed under seal. Morrissey decried the search, which was extensively covered by local media, as political skullduggery. Time out: Technically the most junior member of the House because of his resignation and re-election, Morrissey has been moved to a desk in a far corner of the chamber . But that spectacle and the conviction were not enough to derail his candidacy in a district where he has repeatedly captured at least 70 percent of the vote. Morrissey's supporters, and the delegate himself, attribute his popularity to his attention to constituent service in black-majority district where voters feel their voices are not heard by the political establishment at the Capitol. 'We compare him to Marion Barry,' the charismatic former Washington mayor who was elected to a fourth term after serving prison time for a drug offense, Morrissey supporter Preston Brown said in an interview before the latest charges were divulged. 'He had issues but was always there and could be counted on.' Morrissey's issues began with the courthouse fistfight, which became known as the 'brawl in the hall,' as well as fisticuffs with a contractor, several contempt of court citations, and the loss and reinstatement of his license to practice law. He embraced the colorful image, decorating his law office with boxing gloves and advertising as a lawyer who would fight for his clients.

"A popular Cornish beach has been stripped of all its sand by a freak high tide, leaving nothing but rocks covered in seaweed and algae. But just hours later, the change in tide deposited the golden sands back in their place. Porthleven, a holiday spot famed for its stretches of beach, was left with exposed rocks after the unusual ride swept away sand overnight. Scroll down for video . The scene at Porthleven beach after a high tide washed away virtually all the sand overnight on Wednesday 14 January . Much of the sand has disappeared from the beach which sits below the quaint seaside town, with locals describing the exposed rock as the worst they had seen in living memory. But while the sand was stripped away overnight on Wednesday January 14, it has already been deposited back in place. Porthleven is described as an 'unspoilt Cornish fishing harbour' in tourism promotions, and has just welcomed a new restaurant from celebrity chef Rick Stein. Photos from the scene show promenade steps that run down into the lush sand suddenly led to a sharp drop onto rocks. Oceanographer Alan Jorgensen, from Porthleven said he has never seen the level of sand so low in all his years in the village. He said: 'I am sure it will come back in time but I've never seen it like this before. It was a bit of a surprise to be honest.' The dramatic before and after photos show just how bad the erosion was, with sands completely washed away by tides . Locals head back onto the beach at Porthleven, where the sand has been washed back by the tide - just hours after it was washed away . The dramatic changes were reportedly caused by a high tide, as well recent bad weather which has hit the Cornish coast . Karen Wall, 42, from Porthleven, said: 'I've seen it fluctuate, but just going by my mother's wisdom - she's been past that beach every day for 74 years - she's never seen it as bare.' Promoting the Cornish town as a tourist destination, Porthleven is described as having two miles of sandy beaches, as well as a 'picture book location' in tourism materials. Experts calculated that nearly a million tonnes of sand were lost off British beaches last year, with popular beaches in Newquay, Bude and Perranporth also left bare. Estimations were that the sand - which was left languishing offshore in mountainous sandbanks and bars - would take years to return. High tide at Porthleven on January 15 shows the coastline battered by waves which resulted in sand being swept from the beach . The Cornish coast has been battered by high winds and waves as bad weather hit the UK in recent weeks . The seaside town is a favourite spot with holidaymakers and Rick Stein has just taken over a restaurant on the harbour . Locals said they had not seen the beach with so little sand in many years following the 'freak' high tide last Wednesday . Porthleven, in particular, suffered when wild Atlantic storms battered the Cornish coast a year ago, with huge waves sweeping away sands and closing roads. The RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institution) describes Porthleven as: 'A small, mainly shingle beach in a bay backed by cliffs. Home to the Porthleven Reef break.' It advises: 'Only experienced surfers should use this break.' An RNLI spokesperson told MailOnline: ‘The beach is an ever changing environment and we’ve seen a lot of sand movement in recent years as a result of the weather. 'The continual changing topography of beaches can present new hazards so people should always be mindful of this if they’re visiting the coast and take extra care.’ The seaside town of Porthleven is almost unrecognisable compared to the recent images after the sand was swept away by high tides . Porthleven beach is becoming a fashionable destination for summer, with Rick Stein also opening a restaurant in the area . Already a popular destination in Cornwall, Porthleven is set to become a even more a hotpot with a slew of new restaurant openings in the next year. In November last year, Rick Stein took over the harbourside Clay Quay restaurant, his first eatery outside of Padstow. Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, said: 'Porthleven is certainly on the hotlist for 2015. Boasting a beautiful coastline, an enviable foodie offering; especially with the recent opening of Rick Stein’s new restaurant; and an impressive harbour, the town oozes Cornish charm and tradition. 'It’s all these elements that contribute to Porthleven’s thriving tourism scene and make it a year round destination – definitely a place to put on your must-visit list for the year ahead.'","Porthleven beach is famed for its two miles of sandy and rocky beaches and 'quaint' atmosphere .

"A farmer has claimed he has found the remains of a two Chupacabra creatures also known as blood sucking monsters after stumbling across bizarre-looking dead animals in Chile. Goat farmer Javier Prohens was having lunch with friends when terrified farmhand 54-year-old Bricio Saldivar alerted them to the bodies of the strange creatures on the outskirts of the small town of Monte Patria in the east central Chilean province Limari. At first the group thought the remains were those of bats but on closer inspection, they became convinced they are from they mythical creatures. The remains found by goat farmer Javier Prohens, who believes they could be the bones of a Chupacabra, a mythical blood sucking creature . Mr Prohens, 54, said: 'He was clearly scared and said he had been up at the old winery and found two strange bodies. 'When we got there we saw them lying among some hay bales in one of the cellars. 'At first we thought they might be bats, but when we looked closer, we realised they had to be something else as the heads were too big for bats. 'And then someone said they looked like Chupacabras.' Translated into Spanish as 'goat sucker' Chupacabras are reptile-like mythical creatures with leathery and scaly green-grey skin with sharp pins and quills running down its back. They are said to be four foot tall and hop like a kangaroo, while living in Central and South American countries. The name comes from the monster's habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, especially goats. Local children crowd around the remains found by the goat farmer. The discovery has worried other farmers in the area who are concerned about the safety of their livestock . And now the find has sparked fears among other farmers in the nearby area. Querubin Lebron, 38, said: 'Our livelihoods are built on goat farming. There are lots of goats here. 'Although it's said they only attack animals, who knows it is won't attack our children too.' In April last year, a couple from Texas claimed they had captured a Chupacabra in their back garden. However, after an investigation, it was established that the creature was a raccoon suffering from scabies.","Chilean farmer Javier Prohens was alerted to bizarre looking  remains .

"An alleged killer accused of murdering two pensioners has claimed they were attacked by an intruder and a Polish man who went 'absolutely wild' after a sexual encounter. Leo Barnes told jurors he witnessed assaults on Cynthia Beamond and Philip Silverstone, and had done nothing to harm them at their respective homes in the West Midlands and London. Barnes is accused of murdered Mrs Beamond, 80, and Mr Silverstone, 67, on consecutive days in June last year. Cynthia Beamond (left) was killed in her home in Birmingham last year. Leo Barnes (right) is accused of her murder and the killing of another man, Philip Silverstone, in his north London home the following day . Giving evidence on the fourth day of his trial, Barnes told jurors that Mrs Beamond was struck over the head with a saucepan by an intruder who then ordered him to clean up a trail of blood. Barnes said he believed he had been followed to Mrs Beamond's home in Halesowen, by three men who robbed him of drugs, cash and a mobile phone at gunpoint. The 33-year-old, from Birmingham, said the attack on Mrs Beamond and subsequent threats not to speak about it, had left him 'absolutely terrified'. Barnes told jurors at Wolverhampton Crown Court: 'They just came from nowhere. They said 'Look, you are getting robbed, keep your mouth closed'. ' Barnes, who denies two counts of murder, said he thought Mrs Beamond, who he knew from childhood, was still alive when he left her house. Mrs Beamond's body was found hidden under storage in the garage of her home in Halesown, Birmingham . The following day, Barnes told the court, he drove to London, arriving at Mr Silverstone's flat in Belsize Park at about 11pm. Inside the property, Barnes said, Mr Silverstone was sitting with his wife and a man he was told was Polish. After informing jurors that he is bisexual, Barnes told the court that he went into a bedroom with the Polish man and paid him £80 to have sex. He said: 'I had a sexual encounter with this person, and after he said the agreement was for me to pay him. So the next thing I know, we end up having a fight, me and this Polish man.' Forensics workers and police at the house where Mrs Beamond was bludgeoned to death (above) Barnes, a father-of-two, was seen in the area on the day of Mrs Beamond's death; he is later said to have been captured on CCTV pawning a television stolen from her house . According to Barnes' account, Mr Silverstone then entered the bedroom and became embroiled in a 'three-way fight' as the Polish man armed himself with a knife. Barnes claimed that he saw the Polish man strike Mr Silverstone with a car jack, before he left the scene, 'I just didn't want to be part of what was going on'. The trial continues tomorrow.

"Internet provider TalkTalk is to become the latest to block pornographic websites by default in an attempt to protect children. Any customer who has so far ignored online prompts from the company will find adult material automatically filtered under a scheme being rolled out next month. The move follows Sky’s decision to install a family-friendly filter unless households specifically ask for it to be turned off. Pressure was last night building on BT and Virgin Media to introduce similar safeguards to reduce the risk of children accessing hardcore images or videos. Internet provider TalkTalk is to become the latest to block pornographic websites by default in an attempt to protect children (stock image) ressure was last night building on BT and Virgin Media to introduce similar safeguards to reduce the risk of children accessing hardcore images or videos . Child safety experts said there was no excuse for the two companies, who between them have almost 15million customers, not to follow suit. The latest move is another victory for the Daily Mail which has campaigned for an automatic block on online porn. David Cameron has called on all internet companies to do more to protect children from the ‘devastating’ impact of accessing pornography. New customers signing up to TalkTalk have its HomeSafe filter turned on by default. The group has also contacted the majority of its 4million broadband customers requiring them to choose whether to activate the filter – with the ‘on’ setting pre-selected. But parents who have not visited the TalkTalk website will not have received the prompt, meaning it is possible their children could still see inappropriate material on the internet. Next month the company will roll out technology that targets customers who have not already opted to prohibit or allow adult content. Anyone attempting to access a pornographic website will be told it is blocked, and required to log in with an adult’s details in order to turn off the filter. All TalkTalk customers will be asked every 12 months to re-affirm their decision to allow or block adult websites; pictured above is the company's chief executive Dido Harding . TalkTalk chief executive Dido Harding said: ‘Our HomeSafe technology is free for all our customers and lets them filter out categories of inappropriate content such as pornography, violence and gambling.’ All TalkTalk customers will be asked every 12 months to re-affirm their decision to allow or block adult websites. Child safety campaigners welcomed the move and called on BT and Virgin to implement similar measures. Simon Bass, chief executive of the Churches’ Child Protection Advisory Service, said: ‘There can be no excuse now.’ A BT spokesman said that by the end of this month it will have contacted all its existing customers requiring them to choose if they want to turn on its free parental controls. A Virgin Media spokesman said: ‘Our customers are able to use the free tools and expert advice we offer but it is for individuals to choose what is right for them.’","New customers to TalkTalk will have the filter turned on by default .

"Eating cats and dogs   is largely heavily frowned upon, and in most cases illegal, across Europe. But archaeologists have found that our ancestors likely ate these small carnivores during famines or food shortages. The finding of bones with human teeth marks dating back 3,100 to 7,200 years ago suggests the diet of Europeans once included these animals. The discovery was made at the El Mirador cave (shown) in Atapuerca, Spain. Archaeologists found bones with human teeth marks in them. The animals in the 'diet' included dogs, wild cats, foxes and badgers. Lead researcher Dr Patricia Martin said they may have been eaten during times of famine and food shortage . The discovery was made at the El Mirador cave in Atapuerca, Spain by archaeologists from the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution (IPHES). In July 2014 an expert claimed that eating dogs shouldn’t necessarily be discouraged, and in fact adding the domesticated pets to our menus could be beneficial. In an opinion piece for CNN John Sutter said eating dogs is the equivalent of eating pigs, another intelligent creature. He cited figures from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) that said 1.2 million dogs are euthanised every year in the US. And he suggested eating them could be helpful in disposing of euthanised dogs. The remains of certain animals recovered from Neolithic and Bronze Age times suggest they were eaten by humans. In total 24 fossils were found indicating dogs and other animals were eaten. El Mirador was used to shelter flocks such as cattle, which were often eaten by the cave dwellers. But it appears small carnivores were also eaten, based on cut marks, bone breakage and signs of culinary processing found in the page. ‘In El Mirador Cave, the dogs were disarticulated, defleshed and boiled,’ said Dr Patricia Martin of IPHES, who led the findings. She said it was a possibility that humans only resorted to such meals during times of famine and food shortage. Shown is one of the bones recovered, from a dog, with noticeable human teeth marks on them, suggesting that Europeans once ate such small carnivores . El Mirador cave in Spain, shown, was used to store certain animals such as cattle, which were often eaten alongside the other carnivores. In total 24 fossils were found indicating dogs and other animals were eaten . However, she added that in some cultures such as in Asia, ‘it is considered dog meat as a rich source of protein and/or as a delicatessen meat.’ Therefore, she said: ‘It cannot be excluded that in some cases the objective was to obtain the skin of these animals.’ It’s also possible that some of the other animals, like wild cats and badgers, were boiled and consumed by accident given the difficulty of hunting wild carnivores. ‘However, neither it's possible to reject the option of being used as an extra source of food in times of shortage,’ said Dr Martin. It’s possible that some of the other animals, like foxes (stock image shown) and badgers, were boiled and consumed by accident given the difficulty of hunting wild carnivores .","Discovery was made at the El Mirador cave in Atapuerca, Spain .

"It is said there is no such thing as being over-prepared, and this is clearly a motto the Lithuanian government has taken to heart as it publishes a 98-page guide on how to survive an invasion. The small Baltic state has released the manual, entitled How to Act in Extreme Situations or Instances of War, so its three million citizens will know exactly what to do should war come to their home soil. Its handy hints include keeping calm, using Facebook to organise resistance and - if all else fails - simply doing your job a little worse than you did before. Lithuania's government has released a manual entitled How to Act in Extreme Situations or Instances of War . The guide advises: 'Keep a sound mind, don't panic and don't lose clear thinking. 'Gunshots just outside your window are not the end of the world.' The manual, which the Defence Ministry has sent to the country's libraries and is planning to distribute at army events, says Lithuanians should resist foreign occupation with demonstrations and strikes, 'or at least doing your job worse than usual'. In the event of invasion, the manual says Lithuanians should organise themselves through Twitter and Facebook and attempt cyber attacks against the enemy. It also suggests the best exit routes from the country, should residents want to flee, as well as advising people to keep their car tanks full. Indeed, the government is so worried about a possible invasion, it is also considering requiring all future buildings to incorporate a bomb shelter on the premises. But while the idea of a war in Lithuania may seem somewhat unlikely to an outside observer, government ministers have explained the move was sparked by recent tensions between their far larger neighbour Russia and the Ukraine. The guide was compiled in reaction to Russia's aggressive behaviour towards neighbouring states . Less than 500 miles separate Moscow from its border, and it is increasingly worried about Russia, not least because of a military drill in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad last month that featured 9,000 soldiers and more than 55 naval vessels. 'The examples of Georgia and Ukraine, which both lost a part of their territory, show us that we cannot rule out a similar kind of situation here, and that we should be ready,' Defence Minister Juozas Olekas explained. 'When Russia started its aggression in Ukraine, here in Lithuania our citizens understood that our neighbor is not friendly,' Already, the country - which spent most of the last century under the control of the Soviet Union, but clearly plans on being its own boss in this one - has increased recruitment for both its army and paramilitary reserve force. Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine last year, and Western governments say they have overwhelming evidence that it is supplying troops and weaponry to pro-Russian separatists who have seized parts of eastern Ukraine, an accusation that Moscow denies.","Recent aggression between Russia and the Ukraine prompted new guide .

"Every year on his daughter's birthday, Ian Sullivan visits the grave of the child he lost when a gunman slipped into a Colorado movie theater and fatally shot the six-year-old as she sat with her mother in the fourth row. And every year, he finds a birthday card on the headstone from the man who was with Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6,  when he couldn't be: the police officer who carried the dying girl out of the theater in his arms. Since losing his daughter in the 2012 attack, Sullivan withdrew, cutting ties with many of those he had been closest with and retreating to a home in the mountains. But the 28-year-old found a lifeline in the police officer who shared in his daughter's final moments. The officer he only knows by his first name: Mike. Scroll down for video . Lost: Ian Sullivan, 28, lost his daughter, Veronica Moser-Sullivan,6,  in the July 2012 Aurora, Colo. theatre shooting that left 12 dead and 70 injured . Veronica: Veronica was with her mother, Ashley Moser, in the Aurora theatre when shots rang out hitting them both, fatally wounding Veronica and paralyzing Moser . Officer: While grieving the death of his daughter, Sullivan has found a lifeline in the officer who carried his dying daughter out of the theatre, Mike Hawkins (photographed) Just after midnight on July 20, 2012, Sullivan fell asleep at his Denver studio apartment, exhausted after returning from one of the long-haul routes he drove as a trucker. Two hours later, he was awakened by his phone. Sergeant: Hawkins, of the Aurora Police Department has since been promoted to the rank of Sergeant . A relative of his ex-wife, Ashley Moser, told him there had been a shooting at the theater. Veronica was dying. He arrived too late to say goodbye to his daughter. Her mother was paralyzed in the attack. Days later, he asked a victim's advocate to introduce him to the police officer who carried Veronica from the theater. The officer is Mike Hawkins, who declined to comment to The Associated Press, citing a judge's gag order barring attorneys, authorities or witnesses from talking to the news media about the case. They met at a police station in Aurora, not far from the theater. The officer told Sullivan that he, too, was a father. Sullivan said the officer told him that he thought he felt Veronica's heartbeat as he carried her. Sullivan realizes the officer probably felt his own pulse racing. 'The most comforting thing for me was knowing he was a father himself. To know that he picked her up the same way he picks up his own kids and he carried her the same way he carries his own kids,' Sullivan said. He told the officer the hardest part was feeling powerless and unable to protect his daughter. 'I know it took a lot out of him as well,' he said. 'I could see how much damage it had done to him.' More than two years later, the officer still checks in on Sullivan with texts on the days that are the hardest — holidays and the birthday, Sullivan said. Lifeline: Since the fatal shooting, Sullivan has found a lifeline in the police officer who shared in his daughter's final moments . Divorced: Sullivan (right) and Moser (back right) divorced when Veronica was 3, but Sullivan still saw Veronica regularly and reveled in their time outdoors . 'It's not so much all he was able to tell me, but more so the understanding that I was not alone,' he said. Getting the sporadic text messages and seeing the birthday cards reminds him that someone else out there is thinking about his pain. 'It helps,' Sullivan said, 'to understand there's still someone there who actually cares.' The young girl Hawkins scooped up that night was born when Sullivan was 19. At the time, he and the girl's mother, Moser, weren't necessarily ready for parenthood, he said. Withdrew: After the death of his daughter, Sullivan withdrew, cutting ties with many of those he had been closest with and retreating to a home in the mountains . Change: Veronica was born when Sullivan was 19 years old, and he said having her dramatically changed his life . But he was proud when he saw his newborn daughter.

The couple divorced when Veronica was 3, but he still saw her regularly. He reveled in their time outdoors. On a recent afternoon at his home, Sullivan flipped through photos of her: Veronica on a sandy beach. In a race car. On the first day of kindergarten. She flashes a toothless grin beneath her sandy blonde hair and Hello Kitty earrings. He pushed a button on a photo frame she gave him a month before her death, and her voice filled the room. 'I love you, Daddy,' she cooed, stumbling over a Father's Day greeting. To keep Veronica's memory alive, he tries to do the things he used to do with her — hiking, skiing, working on cars. She used to hand him wrenches while he was under the chassis, he said. He tries to stay busy to keep his mind from wandering into darker thoughts. It doesn't always work. 'I wasn't there to protect her,' he said. Sullivan's father, Robert Sullivan, said he encourages his son to talk and tries to listen. 'What I notice is a very strong underlying anger and anguish that is going to be very difficult to overcome,' he said. 'It's going to forever alter him.' Attorneys for the gunman, James Holmes, acknowledge that he killed 12 people and injured 70 others. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Jury selection in his murder trial began Tuesday and is expected to continue for months.

"CNN has joined Fox News Channel in saying that it was mistaken to report in the wake of an attack on the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo that there were neighborhoods in Europe considered 'no go' zones for non-Muslims. Fox apologized over the weekend for on-air comments made by pundits, including one who described the English city of Birmingham as 'totally Muslim.' In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo threatened to sue Fox over comments made about her city. Apology: Anderson Cooper has said he was mistaken in referring to 'no go' Muslim areas in Europe. He said: 'if you are going to point fingers at other people's mistakes, you should also acknowledge your own mistakes and we didn't do that on the program.' On Monday, CNN's Anderson Cooper aired a story on his program about what Fox had said. But The Washington Post subsequently pointed out the supposed 'no go' zones were talked about on CNN the previous week — including on Cooper's program. Cooper even used one analyst's comments about Muslim-dominated areas as the basis for a question he put to another guest. 'If you are going to point fingers at other people's mistakes, you should also acknowledge your own mistakes and we didn't do that on the program,' Cooper said on the air Wednesday night. Cooper noted that he did not challenge his guests. 'I should have been more skeptical,' he said. 'Won't make the same mistake again.' Blunder: Fox's Steven Emerson, billed as an expert on terrorism-related issues, was described by Prime Minister David Cameron as 'a complete idiot' and widely mocked by Twitter users after informing viewers Birmingham was 'totally Muslim' and was not visited by people of other faiths .

"This is the moment the blue and gold braided beard on the burial mask of famed pharaoh Tutankhamun was hastily glued back on with the wrong adhesive, damaging the relic after it was knocked during cleaning. The 3,300-year-old golden treasure was broken while its case was being cleaned at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. However, rather than calling in the experts, a curator phoned her husband who decided to do the repair himself using a glue bought in a DIY store. Things went from bad to worse when the adhesive leaked onto the boy king’s chin and had to be scratched off – causing further damage. The botch job has also left a gap between the face and beard. Scroll down for video . This is the moment the blue and gold braided beard on the burial mask of famed pharaoh Tutankhamun was hastily glued back on with the wrong adhesive, damaging the relic after it was knocked off during cleaning . The 3,300-year-old golden treasure was broken while its case was being cleaned at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The repair job has left the burial mask permanently damaged, with a gap between the face and beard . Museum staff have since agreed that the glue was totally unsuited to the job, which was rushed in order to get it quickly back on display. Lights in the exhibition room have now been dimmed to disguise the damage to the mask – which has long been associated with a curse. The Egyptian Museum is one of the city's main tourist sites and Tutankhamun's mask and other contents of his tomb are the museum's top exhibits. Three of the museum's curators reached by telephone gave differing accounts of how the burial mask came off last year. They also could not agree whether the beard was knocked off by accident while the mask's case was being cleaned or if was removed because it was loose. They did agree, however, that orders came from above to fix it quickly and that an inappropriate adhesive was used. All spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of professional reprisals. 'Unfortunately he used a very irreversible material - epoxy has a very high property for attaching and is used on metal or stone but I think it wasn't suitable for an outstanding object like Tutankhamun's golden mask,' one curator said. The golden mask of Tutankhamun (pictured) has been left permanently damaged after its 'beard' was stuck on with epoxy. The ancient mask and other contents of Tutankhamun's tomb are the museum's top exhibits . 'The mask should have been taken to the conservation lab but they were in a rush to get it displayed quickly again and used this quick drying, irreversible material,' they added. The curator said that the mask now shows a gap between the face and the beard, whereas before it was directly attached: 'Now you can see a layer of transparent yellow.' Another museum curator, who was present at the time of the repair, said that epoxy had dried on the face of the boy king's mask and that a colleague used a spatula to remove it, leaving scratches. The first curator, who inspects the artifact regularly, confirmed the scratches and said it was clear that they had been made by a tool used to scrape off the epoxy. Egypt's tourist industry, once a pillar of the economy, has yet to recover from three years of tumult following the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Museums and the opening of new tombs are part of plans to revive the industry. But authorities have made no significant improvements to the Egyptian Museum since its construction in 1902, and plans to move the Tutankhamun exhibit to its new home in the Grand Egyptian Museum scheduled to open in 2018 have yet to be divulged. The burial mask is kept in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (above), which is one of the city's main tourist sites . Neither the Antiquities Ministry nor the museum administration could be reached for comment on Wednesday evening. One of the curators said an investigation was underway and that a meeting had been held on the subject earlier in the day. The burial mask, discovered by British archeologists Howard Carter and George Herbert in 1922, triggered worldwide interest in archaeology and ancient Egypt when it was unearthed along with Tutankhamun's nearly intact tomb. 'From the photos circulating among restorers I can see that the mask has been repaired, but you can't tell with what,' Egyptologist Tom Hardwick said. 'Everything of that age needs a bit more attention, so such a repair will be highly scrutinised.' The mummified and embalmed face of Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun, pictured on display in a climate controlled case in his tomb at the Valley of the Kings . Tutankhamun was an Egyptian pharaoh who ruled from 1332BC - 1323BC after taking the throne at the age of nine or ten. The son of Akhenaten, when he became king, he married his half-sister, Ankhesenpaaten. However, his reign was short-lived; he died at the age of 19 and is believed to have suffered from scoliosis, a condition which means the spine is curved. He remains one of the best known pharaohs and there has been widespread research about his life and health following the discovery of his tomb. In 1907, Lord Carnarvon George Herbert asked English archaeologist and Egyptologist Howard Carter to supervise excavations in the Valley of the Kings. On 4 November 1922, Carter's group found steps that led to Tutankhamun's tomb, which would eventually lead to what was the most complete ancient Egyptian tomb ever discovered. He spent several months cataloguing the antechamber before opening the burial chamber and discovering the sarcophagus in February the following year.","The braided gold beard on Tutankhamun has been permanently damaged .

"A teacher died when she was thrown from her horse, which relatives described as ‘the love of her life’. Jayne Goodwin, 44, had dismounted Kali, her six-year-old Friesian, to close a gate. As she tried to get back on, the ‘flighty’ animal bolted without warning and she fell. The experienced rider suffered ‘unsurvivable’ brain injuries and some days later her devastated family decided to turn off her life-support machine, an inquest at Leeds coroner’s court heard. Primary school teacher Jayne Goodwin, pictured with her horse Kali, died after she fell from her mount . Her brother, Chris, said in a statement: ‘The love of her life was Kali. As a child Jayne had always dreamed of a day when she would have a life full of riding and a stable full of horses, and she was living that life.’ Miss Goodwin, who lived near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, kept seven horses along with three dogs and seven cats. She took Kali to several shows and had taken up dressage competition. But coroner David Hinchliff said the mare had developed a habit of suddenly setting off before her rider was properly mounted. Miss Goodwin’s friend Georgina Adkin said in a statement: ‘Kali was always flighty, but Jayne was a very experienced rider and felt she had her behaviour under control.’ Ms Goodwin, pictured with Kali,  was trying to mount the horse when it bolted at high speed . After going riding with friends on the evening of January 9 last year, Miss Goodwin dismounted Kali to close a gate as the group returned to the stable yard. She then tried to get back on the horse. Mr Hinchliff said: ‘She put her leg into the stirrup, but as she went to lift her right leg over, Kali raised her head and set off at a fast canter.’ Miss Goodwin was heard to cry out, ‘Oh Christ, she’s going’, as the horse bolted. She was carried out of sight of her friends before falling to the ground. Miss Adkin shouted her name, then found her on the ground ‘at a funny angle’ with her helmet still on. She told the inquest: ‘I wasn’t sure whether Kali had hit her in the head as Jayne got on or whether it was the speed at which she set off that caused her to fall.’ Miss Adkin saw blood and, realising her friend was unconscious, called an ambulance. Miss Goodwin was taken to Leeds General Infirmary, and a CT scan revealed a ‘very severe and unsurvivable brain injury’. She was taken off a ventilator 19 days later, on January 28, after doctors told the family she had no chance of recovery. Police attended the accident scene and found there were no suspicious circumstances. Miss Goodwin, who was born in Stockton-on-Tees, moved to Leeds for university when she was 19, the inquest heard. She loved children and spent 14 years as a teacher in Leeds. Several school parents wrote letters to her family after her death. In his statement, Miss Goodwin’s brother said: ‘She made a real difference to those she taught. We will miss her so much. She has left a huge hole in our hearts and lives.’ Mr Hinchliff recorded a verdict of accidental death. The highly experienced rider, who always wore protective equipment, suffered a fatal brain injury .","Jayne Goodwin was trying to mount her horse Kali when it bolted .

"Everyone has off their days - even apes when they're not monkeying around. Indeed, wildlife photographer Graham McGeorge, 43, captured a particularly gloomy-looking guy at the Jacksonville Zoo in Florida recently. However the moment took a jolly twist, as a concerned pal stepped in and grabbed the primate's face to push it into a grin instead of a grimace. McGeorge managed to catch the heart-warming moment between the two primates on camera. Heartwarming moment: A concerned pal steps in and saves this grumpy monkey by pushing its face  into a grin instead of a grimace . The gesture highlights the species' human-like behavior. Other touching moments caught by McGeorge show adult bonobos playing with their young and grooming each other from head to toe. Endangered in the wild because of the destruction of their forest homes and hunting for the bush meat trade, there are thought to be only 50,000 bonobos left alive in the wild. They live only in the Democratic Republic of Congo and like human babies but, unlike other apes, they are born helpless relying totally on their mothers for food and warmth.

"First time mothers who had a Caesarean are more likely to report pain during sex more than a year later. A new study found  the majority of women resumed having sex three months after giving birth. But women who had a Caesarean section were twice as likely to report pain during or after sex even 18 months after having the baby. This was compared to women who had a normal vaginal birth. New mothers who had a Caesarean section, or whose babies were delivered using the help of vacuum extraction were twice as likely to suffer pain during sex 18 months after giving birth . C-section mums had double the risk of pain during sex even compared to women who had a vaginal birth but who suffered a tear in their perineum – the area between the vagina and anus - but didn't need stitches. However, the study did not look at women who had had a difficult vaginal birth. The researchers also did not offer an explanation as to why certain deliveries led to more pain than others. However they concluded that more understanding about how a birth can affect a mother  is needed, and ways to prevent pain during sex should be explored. A Caesarean involves making a cut in the front wall of a woman’s stomach and womb. It is usually carried out under an epidural, where the lower part of the body is numbed, but is sometimes carried out under general anaesthetic. It usually takes 40-50 minutes, but can be performed quicker in an emergency. Mothers who had a vaginal birth using vacuum extraction – in which a midwife applies a vacuum with a soft or rigid cup to the baby's head to help guide it out of the vagina – were also twice as likely to report pain more than a year after giving birth. The study examined data from 1,244 first time mothers across six maternity hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. A Caesarean section is an operation to deliver a baby. It involves making a cut in the front wall of a woman’s abdomen and womb. The operation can be a planned (elective) when a medical need for the operation becomes apparent during pregnancy. It can also be an emergency procedure, when circumstances before or during labour call for delivery of the baby by unplanned Caesarean . A Caesarean section is usually carried out under epidural or spinal anaesthetic, where the lower part of your body is numbed. It usually takes 40-50 minutes, but can be performed quicker in an emergency. Some Caesarean sections are performed under general anaesthetic. A Caesarean section is usually carried out when a normal vaginal birth could put the mother or unborn baby at risk. This could be if the labour doesn't progress naturally, the mother has  placenta praevia (where the placenta is low lying in the womb and covering part of the womb's entrance). Other reasons include if the mother has had  two or more previous Caesarean sections or their baby is in the breech (bottom first) position. Source: NHS Choices . The mothers filled in questionnaires at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. Of the women, 49 per cent had a vaginal birth, and two thirds of these women had a tear in the area between their vagina and anus that needed stitches, or an episiotomy. This is a procedure where the midwife deliberately cuts this area to make the opening larger for the baby to get through. Nearly 11 per cent of women had a vaginal birth with their baby helped out by vacuum extraction, and for another 11 per cent of women, their baby was helped out by forceps. Less than 10 per cent were delivered by an elective Caesarean section – where a medical reason meant the mother had opted for this operation before the birth. Another 20 per cent were delivered by an emergency Caesarean section, which meant events before or during labour eventually meant this operation has to be carried out even thought the mother had not initially chosen it. The researchers found 78 per cent of women resumed having sex three months after having their baby. By six months, 94 per cent of women had resumed having sex; 97 per cent resumed 12 months after giving birth and 98 per cent 18 months afterwards. However most of the women (86 per cent) who had started having sex again 12 months after the birth experienced pain. And nearly 45 per cent reported pain at three months after the birth. This went down to 43 per cent at six months, 28 per cent at 12 month and 23 per cent by 18 months. Of those that reported pain during sex at six months after having their baby, a third said this pain persisted a year later. Women who had an elective Caesarean section, an emergency Caesarean section or a vaginal birth with vaccum extraction were twice as likely to report pain during sex 18 months after giving birth. The researchers said other factors associated with pain during sex at this time include whether the women experienced it before becoming pregnant, partner abuse and fatigue. While 78 per cent of women resumed having sex three months after giving birth, 45 per cent experienced pain during sex. A third of women with pain  at six months after the birth said this pain persisted a year later . One of the study's authors, Ellie McDonald, from the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Victoria, Australia said: 'Almost all women experience some pain during first sexual intercourse following childbirth. 'However, our findings show the extent to which women report persisting pain at six and 18 months after birth is influenced by events during labour and birth, in particular Caesarean section and vacuum extraction delivery. 'Not enough is known about the longer term impact of procedures on the mother's health. 'The fact that pain during sex is more common among women experiencing operative procedures points to the need for focusing clinical attention on ways to help women experiencing ongoing illness, and increased efforts to prevent illness after birth where possible.' Patrick Chien, deputy editor-in-chief of the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, added: 'This is the first study with detailed, frequent and long-term follow-up to assess associations of dyspareunia with obstetric risk factors. 'This study provides us with robust evidence about the extent and persistence of pain during sex after birth  and associations with mode of delivery and cuts to the perineum. 'Future research could look into ways of preventing pain during sex.'","Three months after giving birth 78% of women resumed having sex .

On Thursday, the alleged victim recounted how she had drank more alcohol than usual while out with friends at a local bar, the Tin Roof, and while there, she bumped into Vandenburg, whom she was dating. The last thing she can remember is being in the bar at around midnight, she said. 'I remember waking up in an unfamiliar room at 8-something the next morning,' she said. After the alleged attack, she had walked to a friend's neighboring room and slept there for about three hours. She woke up feeling disorientated, sick and in pain, she said. She recalled how she felt pain on some parts of her body, such as her shoulder, wrist and knee, but she did not feel as if she had been sexually assaulted. 'I was sore all over but those hurt particularly badly,' she recalled. That afternoon, the woman said that Vandenburg invited her to his room before initiating sex . They had unprotected sex for a few seconds, which left her 'confused', she said. Injuries: Katherine Parnell, a nurse at Metro General who carried out a rape kit on the victim, said the young woman had multiple bruises across her thighs and buttocks, and scratches on her feet . In the days after, she became 'somewhat' aware of rumors about the incident, she said, but when she texted with Vandenburg, he insisted that he was 'getting blamed for stuff that didn't even happen'. Initially the woman offered to help him, she said. Several days after the alleged assault, she went to Metro General to undergo a rape kit. The nurse who attended to her, Katherine Parnell, testified on Thursday that rape kits are usually carried out within 72 hours of the incident - putting the woman's outside that window. Parnell had noted that the student had multiple bruises across her thighs and buttocks, scratches on her ankles and a wound to her knee. By looking at how the injuries were healing, it appeared they had likely occurred around the time of the incident, Parnell testified. She added that when the woman came to the hospital, she could recall nothing of an alleged assault, including whether or not she had had sex or if condoms had been worn. Shocking: The victim's former roommate took the stand on Wednesday to describe what she looked like the morning after the attack, expressing her shock at how disheveled her friend had appeared . It was only later that the woman watched cell phone footage from the assault and identified herself as the victim, she said, The Tennessean reported. She only watched it once, she said. The jury previously heard how Vandenburg had sent footage and pictures of the alleged attack to friends in California before urging them to delete it the following morning. 'Did you consent to any of the acts done to you?' Prosecutor Tom Thurman asked the woman. 'Absolutely not,' she responded. On Wednesday, the woman's best friend described how her then-roommate's distressing appearance the morning after the attack is said to have occurred. Lauren Miller said she went to a bar with the victim the night leading up to the attack, and told the court her reaction the next time she saw her friend the following morning. She says her roommate came back to their condo with a gash on her leg, looking ill and 'out of it'. 'My immediate reaction was ""Woah, what happened to you?""' Miller recalled. Co-accused: Former Vanderbilt players Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie (left) and Brandon Banks (right) also face charges connected to the alleged rape. McKenzie testified that he did not touch the woman . 'So just from a physical standpoint, starting from top to bottom, her makeup was completely disheveled, the one thing I very clearly remember was the state of her hair. She had had it curled the night before and I remember being like, ""'Did you go jump in a pool?""' She says she also found her roommate's black heel on the lawn outside their condo, and later overheard a voicemail message left by Vandenburg that her friend played on speaker. 'I heard him talking to (the woman) and saying he had just gotten out of football meeting, and he was being accused of some very horrible things that he did not do,' Miller recalled. 'And he was telling (the woman) to not believe anything she heard.' Vandenburg and former teammates Cory Batey, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks face five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg faces an additional charge of tampering with evidence and unlawful photography. Two other former Vanderbilt athletes took the stand as well on Wednesday to give their witness accounts of the event. Questions: Miles Finley, Vandenburg's friend from California, told jurors he was receiving graphic videos from his friend on the night of the attack but did not know that the alleged rape was happening at the time . 'Enablers': Former Vanderbilt athletes Michael Retta (left) and Dillon Van Der Wal (right) testified on Wednesday that they saw the victim passed out in front of Vandenburg's door but did not inform police . Then Vanderbilt tennis player Michael Retta and football player Dillon Van Der Wal told the jury that they saw the victim lying outside of Vandenburg's room that morning but neither reported the incident to police at the time. They both gave conflicting reports about whether Vandenburg asked for help moving the girl to his bed. Retta says he saw the alleged victim naked in the morning hours of June 23, while Van Der Wall said he saw the woman with 'handprints on her buttocks'. He also described Vandenburg's emotions that morning, saying he was 'extremely fidgety,' 'not acting normal,' and pacing. The prosecution rested on Thursday afternoon. The trial was expected to last 10 days but is now in its third week.","Brandon Vandenburg and Cory Batey are accused of raping an unconscious student at Vanderbilt with two other men in June 2013 .

"The news of a legal incestuous relationship between an 18-year-old girl and her father has prompted New Jersey to debate a law change. It comes after the anonymous teenager in Great Lakes, Minnesota, said she and her fiance - her father - plan to move to New Jersey to marry. She described their two-year in an interview with Science of Us, from how they fell in love and the first time they had sex to their plans for marriage. Speaking of their first time she said; 'There's a reason I lost my virginity to him - because I'd never felt comfortable with any other man.' The controversial article has prompted a state assembly member to table legislation banning incest. Scroll down for video . An unnamed 18-year-old is sharing her story about how she plans to marry and have children with her father (not pictured above) 'It might be hard to believe, but incest among consenting adults is technically legal in New Jersey,' Assemblywoman Mary Pat Angelini, R-Monmouth, said in announcing the legislation, according to The Tennessean. 'Obviously, these types of relationships violate our acceptable moral standards and should be banned.' The woman, who hails from the Great Lakes region, reconnected with her father when she was 16, this after 12 years of estrangement. Her parents got pregnant on Prom night, and she grew up with her mother, who the young girl claims is bipolar. Her father reached out to her on Facebook when she was in high school, and after the two met up she went to go stay with him for a week. They had sex that week, her first time, and were soon dating. 'It lasted for about an hour and there was a lot of foreplay,' she says. Taking a stand: Mary Pat Angelini has proposed a change in the law to ban incest in New Jersey . 'We both had orgasms. We are so similar, so it's so easy to sexually please each other. For example, we both love neck-biting. I've never been in a more passionate, loving, fulfilling situation.' The two are not even hiding their situation, with many around them aware of what is going on between them. 'Everyone on my mom's side of the family sees us as father and daughter,' she explains. 'Those who know that he's my dad, and that we are engaged, include my father's parents (they can see we are happy together and they can't wait for us to have babies  they treat us just like any other couple), the woman we live with, and my best friend.' The wedding has already been planned, and she will be telling her mother - after the two make the moved to New Jersey. 'We plan to move to New Jersey where we can be safe under the law, since adult incest isn't illegal there, and once I'm there I'll tell everyone,' she says. 'I'll call my mom and let her know that we are in love and we are having children. If she wants to see her grandkids we'll send her money and she can drive to see us.' And while many people, and science, may argue that having a child with a family member can lead to genetic problems, she scoffs at this notion. 'Everybody thinks that kids born in incestuous relationships will definitely have genetic problems, but that's not true,' she explains. 'That happens when there's years of inbreeding, like with the royal family. Incest has been around as long as humans have.' That being said, she says her children will never learn how mommy and daddy first met. 'I don't want to give them any problems,' she says.","Girl, 18, revealed in an interview  she has been dating her father for 2 years .

"Children at a Christian school were asked by Ofsted inspectors if anyone there was gay, it emerged yesterday. It was just one of the ‘inappropriate’ questions posed to pupils when watchdogs visited Durham Free School, which is set to close after being branded ‘intolerant’. The youngsters, aged 11 to 13, were also asked whether they had met someone who was gay or bisexual and whether they had learned how to make a baby. Pupils at The Durham Free School reported being asked questions by a bald man who they thought was in charge, staff said . A follow-up question asked what they would do if someone who was gay or Muslim came to their school. Details of the questions emerged a day after it was revealed how children were branded bigots because one boy gave the wrong answer when asked what a Muslim was. His answer apparently included a reference to terrorism. Following the latest revelations, chairman of the board of governors John Denning blasted the ‘aggressive and intimidatory’ examination by watchdogs during the inspection last November . He said officials arrived ‘expecting to find evidence of religious extremism’ and that the pupils described how they had been quizzed by a ‘tall bald man’ who appeared to be in charge. ‘The trust believes that there is clear evidence that the inspectors were prejudiced by the allegations,’ he wrote. ‘Pupils were embarrassed by some questions from inspectors.’ Mr Denning said inspectors also asked how the school, which serves a prominently white British population, was raising awareness of female genital mutilation – an issue facing communities originating from Africa and the Middle East. He added: ‘Whilst important in some contexts, [it] was not a priority for 11 and 12-year-olds in the context of the characteristics of the communities served by the school.’ His eight-year-old daughter Naomi, a pupil at the school, has written an open letter to the Education Secretary criticising inspectors’ ‘searching questions’. It is the latest school to complain about being unfairly penalised by new rules forcing schools to teach British values such as tolerance – designed to combat extremism in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal in Birmingham. Nearby Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland was put into special measures after children were branded intolerant. Durham Free, which has 94 pupils, was opened by parents and teachers in September 2013 but will now close at Easter after Ofsted failed it on a range of factors. Following the visit last year inspectors criticised its poor teaching, attainment and behaviour. But they also claimed some children were ‘discriminatory’, adding: ‘Leaders are failing to prepare students for life in modern Britain. Some students hold discriminatory views of other people who have different faiths, values or beliefs from themselves.’ However, teachers say the accusation is based on conversations held with a few confused pupils. The school’s acting headmaster Julian Eisner said parents were ‘disturbed’ about the questions and said children were left ‘distressed and upset’. Calling for Ofsted to review its approach with ‘age-appropriate’ questions, he added: ‘[Pupils] should never be asked questions that make them feel uncomfortable or caught out by the narrow agenda of the person asking the questions.’ Staff also claim teaching has improved under a new leadership team and say inspectors were ‘prejudiced’ by allegations made by a disgruntled former employee. The school, in County Durham, is preparing to mount a challenge against the Department for Education’s decision to withdraw its funding. Parents were told yesterday they had a week to decide on a new school for their children. But Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said Ofsted’s findings come after the Education Funding Agency identified ‘serious concerns about financial management, control and governance’, saying Durham Free had been a ‘troubled school’ for some time. New rules: Guidelines, introduced by the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (pictured) last year, require schools actively to promote 'British values' including democracy, liberty and tolerance' Nearby Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland was put into special measures after children were branded intolerant .","Pupils at The Durham Free School were questioned by Ofsted inspector .

Last month, Judge Howard declared a mistrial in Johnson's second trial. Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said on Tuesday that the court had 'no jurisdiction to grant the acquittal'. 'I want to be clear that there was no prosecutorial misconduct in this case. 'The court agreed there was no misconduct in its prior ruling in December, and again today.' She added that 'the court had no jurisdiction to grant the acquittal and we will be seeking an appeal on those grounds.' Katy O'Donnell, one of two attorneys from the public defender's office who represented Johnson, said: 'Michael Johnson has maintained his innocence from day one. 'We absolutely, firmly believe the court did the right thing and justice was done.'","A judge dismissed all charges against Michael Johnson, 30, on Tuesday .

"With an election looming, he clearly needs to keep his strength up.

David Cameron said on Wednesday that he would rather eat at Nando’s than a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, while Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls spoke of his love of the Olympic Breakfast at Little Chef. According to Pret a Manger’s website, its Swedish Meatball Hot Wrap contains pork meatballs, sliced Greve cheese, chilli tomato sauce and sliced red onions encased in a tortilla wrap. Its salt content is half the recommended daily amount for an adult man, while the fat content is almost 40 per cent – but the firm says the wrap is ‘high in protein’ with a ‘good mix of the B vitamins’.

"This is the moment a shameless shopper agrees to go out with a man she previously turned down for lunch after promised she'll meet David Beckham if she comes along. Browsing jewellery in a shop window in Hitchin Market Square, Hertfordshire, the woman curtly turns down prankster Paul Klein when he asks her to join he and a group of friends for a meal. Asked whether she'll take a photograph of the man and his comedy sidekick, Paul Woods, she takes the latter's iPhone into her hands. Scroll down for video . Paul Wood and Paul Klein approach the woman as she browses jewellery in a shop window in Hitchin . After being turned down, the men ask the woman to take a picture of them using one of their mobile phones . When 'David Beckham' phones, the woman bashfully hands the phone back. Within minutes, she tells the pair that she's changed her mind, on the basis that she would 'love to meet' the former footballer and his family. The encounter, a 'social experiment' by Woody and Kleiny as they call themselves, was filmed from afar and shared on YouTube. 'We wanted to see what would happen once she thought there was a celebrity involved. We'd already done a similar experiment called The Wag Experiment,' said Mr Klein, 23. 'We approached a lady and I asked her on a date. She said no, but when Woody approached me pretending I was a famous footballer and asked for a selfie with me she quickly changed her mind. 'The whole idea was to have a bit of a laugh, but ultimately we wanted to send out a moral message saying you should get to know people and not just because of who their friends are.

The woman quickly changes her mind, telling the men she'd 'love' to meet the Beckham family and begins walking towards the hidden camera . Unable to keep their cool, the pair reveal the encounter has been filmed as part of a prank and that, to her disappointment, the woman will not be meeting David Beckham afterall . 'It was really hard to act natural when we filmed the video. Obviously it's a bit far fetched to have David Beckham call you so we had to pay attention to detail in coming across as convincing as possible.

'We had to tell her then - luckily she saw the funny side but didn't want her face revealing.' Since being posted on YouTube on Tuesday, the video has amassed thousands of comments and likes. The pranksters, who appeared on Britain's Got Talent as football experts, say they hope the clips will propel them into a career in television presenting.

"Kris Jenner may have been the most anticipated star at last night's National Television Awards, but it seems her daughter Kim still managed to put her stamp on the ceremony despite not even being there. Kim, known and loved for her glamorous wardrobe, seemingly inspired several of the stars on Wednesday night. Chloe Sims, Gemma Collins, Casey Batchelor and Stephanie Davis all appeared to have channelled the style queen with their red carpet choices. Scroll down for video . TOWIE star Chloe Sims channeled Kim Kardashian, right, in a skin-hugging PVC dress... and she's not the only one who appeared to be Keeping Up With Kim at Wednesday night's National Television Awards . Chloe Sims, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, chose to don a sexy dress a la Kim. Chloe stood out from the crowd in her all-black ensemble as she teamed the plunging dress with black stiletto heels and a matching clutch bag. The TOWIE veteran ensured that her red manicure matched her red lipstick while she styled her locks in the glamorous curls. The 32-year-old proved she doesn’t have an inch to pinch in a skin tight PVC dress, but haven't we seen that look before? Kim spearheaded the latex and PVC trend back in November last year wearing the Atsuko Kudo strapless blush-pink ensemble, right, in Australia. Left, Chloe Sims at the NTAs last night . Hollyoaks actress Stephanie Davis, left, went for a gothic-inspired look extremely similar to the plunging Givenchy leotard-style bodice that Kim wore at Paris Fashion Week in 2014, right . Back in September last year, Kim wore a very similar style to watch her rapper beau Kanye perform at the Made In America festival. The 34-year-old went all out in a skintight leather frock as she supported the rapper backstage, accompanied by her sisters Kylie Jenner and Khloe and mother Kris in Los Angeles. And how could we forget the figure-hugging tight latex outfit she wore in Melbourne to launch her fragrance in November last year? The mother-of-one squeezed her hourglass figure into the Atsuko Kudo strapless blush-pink ensemble with her cleavage almost spilling out and her now infamous derriere very much on show. Essex star Gemma Collins oozed sophistication in an on-trend tuxedo style suit dress, left, similar to one Kim wore in 2013, right . Hollyoaks actress Stephanie Davis, meanwhile, went for a gothic-inspired look as she flashed the flesh in a sheer lace black dress. The frock, which featured a long-sleeved sheer layer over a strapless black bodysuit, certainly looked familiar. In fact, Kim wore an uncannily similar one arriving at the Givenchy show in Paris in September to support her younger model sister, Kendall. The curvaceous wife of Kanye West looked sexy, yet classy, in a sheer black jumpsuit. Presenter Tess Daly opted for a black and white jumpsuit just like the one that Kim designed for Lipsy, right . The plunging leotard-style bodice, which revealed her ample assets beautifully, flowed into wide see-through trouser legs of embellished lace. Kim loved the look so much that she recently hailed it as her favourite of 2014. Writing on her Twitter, she posed a picture of herself donning the design with the caption: 'This Givenchy look could possibly be my favorite look of 2014.' Glamour girl and former Big Brother star, Casey Batchelor, wore a similar design. Casey also opted to show off her recently reduced cleavage in a sexy sheer gown. The busty starlet drew focus to her 32EE bosom in the lace detail gown which perfectly showcased her slim figure. While her outfit was akin to one Kim has worn, her hair was undeniably similar, too. Essex star Gemma Collins showcased a new style, wearing an on-trend tuxedo style suit dress, similar to one Kim wore when she was pregnant in 2013. Gemma oozed glamour in the sophisticated number, which she teamed with dazzling peep-toe heels and a Louis Vuitton handbag. Tess Daley wore a black and white jumpsuit similar to the one Kim designed for Lipsy last year, while Alesha Dixon championed a polo neck style black dress - a look that's loved by Kim. Kim loves a strong high neck style and it seems that Alesha Dixon, left, took note . Speaking about Kim's much emulated style, Lydia Jones, founder of www.wantherwardrobe.com, said: 'Kim Kardashian has rapidly become one of the world's most stylish fashionistas, famous for dressing her curves to perfection and not being afraid of trying out the most daring trends. 'It's little wonder that the stars at last night's awards are replicating her bang-on-trend looks. 'From super tight two-pieces to oversized coats with leather dresses, we are loving her sexy but sophisticated style. 'Customers are wanting to emulate this classic style, which can be seen in our bandage skirts, polo neck and skirt two-piece sets and low plunging dresses. Our Kim inspired items are always a total sell-out proving that Kimmy is a top style leader for savvy consumers.'","Stars channelled Kim's most celebrated looks .

"The flogging of an internet blogger in Saudi Arabia has again been put on hold due to health concerns after he was inspected by a group of doctors. Raif Badawi is facing 1,000 lashes for criticising clerics in Saudi Arabia but last night a committee of eight doctors requested its suspension on medical grounds, Amnesty International said. Only a few days ago Saudi Arabia was accused of 'outrageous inhumanity' after it delayed the father of three's flogging sentence so his wounds could heal before he was whipped again. Scroll down for video . Father of three Raif Badawi faces 50 lashings every Friday for the next 18 weeks for 'insulting Islam' Mr Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar, fled to Canada with their children. She says he started a forum that was meant to encourage discussion of the Muslim faith. After seeing the video, she said: 'Every lash killed me' Mr Badawi, 31, has won support from governments and human rights groups around the world after he was sentenced to ten years in prison, a £177,000 fine and the lashes. His official crime was to insult Islam but supporters say his real offence was to criticise the country's powerful Sunni clerics on his blog. He faces 50 lashings every Friday for the next 18 weeks. Today Amnesty International repeated its calls for the 'torture' so be unconditionally stopped. The organisation's Middle East deputy director, Said Boumedouha, said: 'Instead of continuing to torment Raif Badawi by dragging out his ordeal with repeated assessments the authorities should publicly announce an end to his flogging and release him immediately and unconditionally. 'Raif Badawi is still at risk, there is no way of knowing whether the Saudi Arabian authorities will disregard the medical advice and allow the flogging to go ahead.' Bowing to massive international condemnation, King Abdullah had recently referred the case to the country's supreme court, giving Mr Badawi's supporters a glimmer of hope it would be halted. However, there has been no official statement from the Saudi government on the monarch's intervention, revealed by Mr Badawi's wife, Ensaf. Last Friday Amnesty, which has adopted Mr Badawi as a prisoner of conscience, said he was taken out of his cell in Jeddah and examined by a doctor who decided that the wounds from his first set of 50 lashes last week had not healed. The round of delayed lashes will now be stopped for a second consecutive week given last night's similar assessment. Leaked video footage taken on a mobile phone is believed to show the first flogging session, as a shackled and standing Mr Badawi is hit on his legs and back by a policeman with a switch. Saudi Arabia has been accused of 'outrageous inhumanity' for delaying Mr Badawi's sentence so his wounds could heal before he was whipped again . Raif and Ensaf in happier times together while they were both still living in Saudi Arabia . Ensaf has since fled the country with their three children, Najwa, 11, Terad, 10, and Miriam, seven . Mr Badawi's wife has fled to Canada with their children. She says he started a forum that was simply meant to encourage discussion of the Muslim faith. After seeing the video, she said: 'Every lash killed me.' Mr Badawi's treatment has triggered global anger about the case. 'Not only does this postponement expose the utter brutality of this punishment, it underlines its outrageous inhumanity,' said Amnesty's Said Boumedouha. 'The notion that Raif Badawi must be allowed to heal so that he can suffer this cruel punishment again and again is macabre and outrageous.' UN officials say the flogging breaches international law as a 'cruel and unusual punishment'. The Foreign Office says it will continue to raise the case. Ensaf - pictured here, centre, campaigning for his release - fears each week the floggings will kill Raif a little more . Protests against Raif's treatment at the hands of the Saudi government have been taking place all over the world - including this one outside the country's embassy in Washington DC .

"A massive fall in heart deaths is chiefly due to changes in diet and lifestyle – not drugs, a study says. Reductions in blood pressure and cholesterol saved more than 20,000 lives in England over seven years, but only a minority were tied to the use of drugs such as statins, it found. More than two-thirds were the result of plummeting smoking rates and dietary changes such as eating less trans fats. More than two-thirds were the result of plummeting smoking rates and dietary changes such as eating less trans fats . Researchers used a mathematical model to assess the role of medication in the huge decline in deaths from 2000 to 2007. Overall, deaths from coronary heart disease fell by 38,000 in that time. Many lives will have been saved by advances in emergency treatment, or by other factors that have not yet been fully explained. But 20,400 deaths were prevented as a direct result of reductions in blood pressure and cholesterol. Only 5,300 of those were linked to the use of statins, the study found. A massive fall in heart deaths is chiefly due to changes in diet and lifestyle – not drugs, a study says . Heart disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, accounting for a third of deaths, or around 180,000 a year. A revolutionary device the shape and size of a paperclip could help up to half a million Britons with persistent high blood pressure. The ROX Coupler is inserted in the groin, where it clips two blood vessels together, diverting some of the blood under high pressure from an artery to a vein. Patients receiving the new device experienced an immediate fall in blood pressure. It could be particularly effective for the estimated 500,000 people with high blood pressure that does not respond to at least three types of medication, known as resistant hypertension. In a study involving patients with the problem, 44 were given the Coupler while 37 received drugs. Those who had the device fitted had ‘a significant and durable reduction’ in blood pressure, says a report published in The Lancet. There was also a cut in the number of hypertensive complications and hospital admissions for high blood pressure crises – there were five among patients having standard treatment and none in patients fitted with the Coupler. Dr Melvin Lobo, principal investigator of the study at Queen Mary University of London and director of the Barts Blood Pressure Clinic at Barts Health NHS Trust, said the new device provides treatment that is fully reversible, immediate and pain-free. He is seeking to carry out more research on the procedure. ‘Drugs do not work for everyone and the Coupler is a big step forward in our search for alternative treatment,’ said Dr Lobo. The NHS has estimated that statins save 7,000 lives a year in the UK. Martin O’Flaherty and colleagues at Liverpool University used trial data, national surveys, and official statistics to calculate how many deaths were prevented and why. Dr O’Flaherty said the best results came from population-wide health measures. He said: ‘Statins were not as effective as they were claimed to be . . . We have been relying on statins, but we are missing an opportunity to reduce levels by population-wide approaches.’ He said curbs on salt and trans fats in processed and takeaway foods, as well as changing smoking habits, did more good than pills. ‘Targeting people one by one is more difficult and more costly. There are bigger health gains from population measures,’ he added. He said his team did not have enough data to say whether recent changes to the use of statins – which are now being prescribed to more people at lower risk of heart disease – would save lives. The analysis, published in online journal BMJ Open, also found that the benefits of using statins were not distributed evenly in society. Among those living in affluent areas, statins were linked to the prevention of 50 per cent more deaths than in deprived areas. Overall, however, falls in blood pressure prevented almost twice as many deaths among the poorest people as among the richest. Dr Mike Knapton, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘We have made significant progress . . . but there is still a long way to go. 'Given the pressures on NHS capacity and budgets, prevention is vital and addressing the health inequalities highlighted by this research could help save even more lives.’","Plummeting smoking rates and dietary changes have played major role .

"They are the generation who are likely to spend a large part of their lives sitting front of a screen. While many claim this can damage interpersonal skills, a new study claims that children under two can learn to communicate just as well from videos as they can from their parents. The US study claims to be the first to isolate the effects of what are described as 'educational commercial videos' on infant learning. A new study claims that children under two can learn to communicate just as well from videos as they can from their parents. The US study claims to be the first to isolate the effects of what are described as 'educational commercial videos' on infant learning . Emory University in Atlanta found that babies were consistently able to understand signs and pick out a photo of the object after watching a video for 15 minutes. The video was shown four times a week for three weeks. Babies who watched the video performed just as well in tests as babies who had been taught signs by their parents under similar conditions. Importantly, after a week without instruction, babies in all groups were still able to produce the signs 0 a much more difficult task than simply recognising them. However, babies in parent-supported groups were able to produce a greater number of signs overall. 'This is the first controlled study to show that babies as young as 15 months can learn communicative skills from commercial videos just as well as from parents,' says Shoshana Dayanim, a lead researcher. 'This is the first controlled study to show that babies as young as 15 months can learn communicative skills from commercial videos just as well as from parents,' says Shoshana Dayanim, a lead researcher . 'They could recognise a novel photo of an object and label it using signs that they had only been exposed to from the video.' The researchers caution that the results should not be seen as an endorsement of video watching for children under two, which has been recommended against by the American Academy of Pediatrics. 'We can't speak to the short-term or long-term cognitive effects of video exposure for infants overall -- only the potential for instruction,' Professor Namy says. 'There are many caveats to our research: the nature of the learning material matters and a lot may depend on the learning context and the formal features of the video.' The research does, however, demonstrate that video can be an effective teaching tool for children under the right circumstances. 'The key takeaway is that babies can learn from commercial videos - at least signs,' Professor Dayanim says. 'The majority of parents continue to expose their babies to video. It will be important to determine the conditions under which videos do and do not support infant learning.' Video-based therapy for families with babies at risk of autism improves infants' engagement, attention and social behaviour. It  might also reduce their risk chances of developing the condition,according to a new study. Researchers showed that using video feedback-based therapy to help parents understand and respond to their baby's early communication style might help modify emerging autism symptoms. 'Targeting the earliest risk markers of autism, such as lack of attention or reduced social interest or engagement, during the first year of life may lessen the development of these symptoms later,' said Jonathan Green, a Manchester University professor of child and adolescent psychiatry. In this study, a specially adapted Video Interaction for Promoting Positive Parenting Programme (iBASIS-VIPP) was delivered to babies aged seven to 10 months who had a higher risk of autism because they had an autistic older sibling. After five months, families who received video therapy showed improvements in infant engagement, attention and social behaviour, suggesting the therapy may be able to modify the emergence of autism-related symptoms, the researchers said.","Atlanta study found babies were consistently able to understand signs and pick out a photo of a related object after watching a video for 15 minutes .

"Google is preparing to sell wireless phone plans directly to consumers, pitching it head to head against America's telecoms giants, reports claim. Google is expected to reach deals to buy wholesale access to Sprint and T-Mobile mobile voice and data networks, making it a mobile virtual network operator. The project, codenamed 'Nova', is expected to be launched later this year, The Information said, citing people familiar with the move. Google headquarters: Google is expected to reach deals to buy wholesale access to Sprint and T-Mobile mobile voice and data networks, making it a mobile virtual network operator . Google was considering launching mobile phone plans for markets where it sells Google Fiber Internet service, according to the report. If everything falls into place, Google could offer discounted wireless data plans that would pressure other major carriers to offer better deals and services or risk losing customers to a powerful rival. More affordable plans, in turn, could bring more people online, something that Google is trying to do because it runs the Internet's dominant search engine and largest advertising network. The Mountain View, California, company would profit from a potentially larger audience for its services. Google also implants its services in its Android mobile operating system, the mostly widely used software on smartphones like this Samsung . Google also implants its services in its Android mobile operating system, the mostly widely used software on smartphones. Representatives from Google, Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. declined to comment on the reports, according to the Associated Press. It is unclear how widely Google plans to sell wireless plans to smartphone owners or when the service would launch. The company already sells an Internet and cable TV service directly to homes. Google Fiber is available in parts of Kansas City, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; Provo, Utah; and Austin, Texas. Google's plans to make its entry into the wireless Internet market by buying access on the networks of Sprint and T-Mobile is known as a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, agreement. Google probably will still have to set up its own operations to handle customer service and billing, an area in which the company doesn't have much previous expertise. Leasing space to Google represents a calculated risk by Sprint, the third largest wireless carrier, and T-Mobile, the four largest. While a deal with Google could boost their revenue, it also opens the door for a deep-pocketed company that could turn into a competitive threat. T-Mobile already has been shaking up the industry during the past year by cutting prices and introducing new service plans that have prompted the two biggest carriers, Verizon Communications and AT&T, to match some of the features.","Google plans to buy wholesale access to others' mobile networks .

"Four Iraqi women have come forward to accuse Australian jihadists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar of kidnapping and enslaving them for two months. The women, who belong to the religious Yazidi minority, told ABC's 7.30 they were taken from Iraq to Syria by force, and were among thousands of others who were targeted because of their beliefs. Sharrouf and Elomar became notorious after leaving Australia with their families to fight for Islamic State, actively detailing their violent efforts on social media. Scroll down for video . Four Yazidi women have accused Australian jihadists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar of kidnapping and enslaving them for two months . Sharrouf in particular has garnered widespread criticism for his posts, uploading a picture of his son holding a severed head and sub-machine gun to the internet. When Islamic State stormed northern Iraq in 2014, they targeted the Yazidis, an ancient Kurdish religious group which IS believes to be infidels. Since 2014, reports of the kidnapping, rape, and forced marriage of Yazidi women has been widely circulated, but the testimonies have been almost impossible to corroborate. The four Yazidi women, who asked for their names to be changed out of fear of reprisals, identified their captors from mug shots presented to them by an ABC journalist. The women kidnapped by Sharrouf and Elomar are believed to have been held on the second floor of a building on Newbridge Road, on the outskirts of Raqqa, in Syria. One of the women, Layla, who claims to have been taken captive said that Sharrouf, who was jailed in Australia for his involvement in a terror plot, threatened to sell the women if they cried.

He said, 'Why are you sad? Forget about your home and family. This is your home and we are your family now,' she told 7.30. 'Forget about your gods, for good, because we have killed them all,' she said. Sharrouf told the women that he had been beaten while in jail in Australia, and that when he got angry, he could kill someone because he had 'no mercy in [his] heart'. Another of the women, Ghazala, said that Sharrouf's five children, who are believed to be with him and his wife, participated in their terrifying ordeal. 'His children were treating us badly,' Ghazala said. 'They had knives and cell phones saying that they will take videos while cutting off our heads because we follow a different religion.' Ten out of the thirteen members of Ghazala's family are still missing, along with tens of thousands of other Yazidi men, women and children. Sharrouf in particular has garnered widespread criticism for his posts, uploading a picture of his son holding a severed head and sub-machine gun to the internet . Sharrouf's five children, who are believed to be with him and his wife, allegedly participated in the women's terrifying ordeal . Two of the women interviewed by 7.30 identified Mohamed Elomar, a former Sydney boxer, as their captor. Elomar, 30, has previously been photographed with Sharrouf holding the severed heads of dead Iraqi soldiers, allegedly held Yazidi woman Layla captive. Of Layla's family, 27 members are still missing, something which she said she can never forgive Elomar for. 'When we asked them about the men, he said they were beheading them,' she told 7.30. 'There were no men alive. He would tell us this is your home, you have no other home, you have to do what we say,' she said. The women claimed that Elomar would take girls for the night, beat them and sell them on. 'At night he was taking a girl downstairs, and when the girl returned she’d tell us, ‘he told me you have to marry me or else I will sell you, and if you say anything to my wife I will sell you or kill you’,' said one of the women.

The women also claim that Sharrouf demanded that the women marry him, despite his Australian marriage to the mother of his five children. The women said that they hoped the Australian government would avenge their trauma if the two men were ever taken captive. 'If those terrorists are ever caught, they must make sure they never escape. I want them to punish those terrorists and torture them,' said one of the women.

"Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan's plea for presidential clemency has been rejected. The anticipated rejection letter, which arrived in Denpasar, in Bali, on Thursday, officially exhausts Chan's legal appeals against his death sentence for drug trafficking. A Denpasar District Court spokesman confirmed Chan's bid had been rejected. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine ringleader has penned a letter to his 15-year-old self to warn young Australians off drugs . Chan, 31, and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran, 33, have been on death row since 2006, and could face death as early as next Sunday under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. Sukumaran was informed on December 30 that his clemency appeal has also been rejected. The pair have been informed that when they are executed they will face the firing squad together for their plot to smuggle over 8 kilograms of heroin into Australia. The Australians may only be given several days notice if scheduled for execution, facing the imminent possibility of their death following the recent increase in criminal executions after a five year respite. Despite Indonesian President Joko Widodo vowing not to grant pardons for drug smugglers, the attorney-general's spokesman, Tony Spontana, said that there was a chance for the executions to be delayed. 'But with regards to death penalty, we have the mechanism to review the decision,' Mr Spontana said. 'Starting from the decision made by the District Court all the way to decision in Judicial Review, including the clemency decision,' reported The ABC. If Chan and Sukumaran are executed under the same conditions that previous inmates have faced, they will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled. Chan and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006 . Sukamaran has been in the same Bali jail as Chan for nearly a decade . The pair will be offered blindfolds to wear, and will have white aprons around their neck and a red target on their chest. Julian McMahon, the pair's Australian lawyer, said that executions were 'not clean killings', and that prisoners may be tied to a plank before being shot. 'If the prisoner isn’t dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head,' Mr McMahon said. Mr McMahon said that Sukamaran and Chan were traumatised by their impending execution, and often dreamed of being shot in the heart by the prison's firing squad. Sukamaran and Chan attended school together at Homebush Boys High School in Sydney's west, and Chan said the pair had been relying on each other in an attempt to 'trying to stay strong for our family and friends at this difficult time.' 'It is hard to think that our lives are in the hands of two men - Tony Abbott and Joko Widodo - who have the power to grant life and death - please pray for a change of heart for these men and for our families,' he wrote in comments passed onto the Facebook page Friends of Andrew Chan. Sukamaran's mercy plea was rejected by the Indonesian government on December 30th, while Chan's plea is yet to be finalised . Mr Abbott (with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, left) said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution . Mr McMahon labelled the potential executions 'chilling', and said that he could not fathom simply taking prisoners outside and shooting them. 'It seemed impossible to be true that they would take out these people on the weekend and just shoot them. That was my first reaction,' Mr McMahon said. News of the looming executions has galvanised Australians seeking clemency for Chan and Sukumaran, with 2,500 signatures on a petition begging Indonesian president Joko Widodo for mercy on their behalf. Mr Abbott said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution, but admitted he would not risk jeopardising diplomatic relations. Chan has written a letter to his younger self, warning of the poor decisions that would lead him to end up in jail for drug smuggling and imploring Australian kids not to follow his mistakes. Mr McMahon, their Australian lawyer, said that the pair had made significant efforts to improve their lives and the lives of others in the Indonesian prison system . Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar, Bali, where Chan and Sukumaran are being detained . The six-page letter was written by Chan, who is scheduled to be executed by firing squad this year, was penned from inside his Bali cell in Kerobokan Prison, where he has spent almost a decade dwelling on the actions that brought him there. In the letter, which features in the new documentary 'Dear Me: The Dangers of Drugs', Chan asks young Australians to question themselves before they make any potential life-altering decisions. 'I don’t know what choices you guys are making, however, if anything, I would want you guys to remember is, ‘Is it worth it?’,' Chan says in the film. 'You are still young and you have some serious decisions to make in your life. What you choose today will make what you become tomorrow. If you want to be a thug and a big bad wolf, I’ll see you soon inside,' reported The Herald Sun. Arrested at 21 for his role in the Bali Nine drug smuggling ring, Chan has had many years 'to look at himself and he is reformed,' said the documentary's maker, Malinda Rutter. Chan has reportedly turned his life around, becoming a leader at the prison and running bible studies and mentoring other prisoners. 'For those that want to do something in life, I’d like you guys to see how important it is to put your head down and study hard.' In the documentary, Chan addresses his 15-year-old self in the hope that the young Australians the film is aimed at will see how stark his future may be. 'Dear me, when you are older you will be in a Bali prison and you will be executed,' Chan says. 'This happened to you because you thought taking drugs was cool.' In the film, Chan explains that he became involved with drugs at an early age, and by the time he was 15, was heavily using the substances that would eventually lead him to jail. 'Your drug taking made you think it was ok to import drugs and make money from this. Your family and friends are heartbroken and your life will be ended by firing squad'. 'Really, underneath you are not a bad person, and drugs made you different,' Chan ends. He says in the film that he has made some bad decisions, and is not proud for many of his actions.","Bali Nine Andrew Chan has had his presidential mercy plea rejected .

"The number of homeowners under 35 has collapsed in the last two decades as first-time buyers struggle to get on to the property ladder. Analysis by the Office for National Statistics shows home ownership has roughly halved for younger age groups, only rising among pensioners. In 1991, one in three Britons aged 16 to 24 owned their own home – a feat unimaginable by 2011 when it had fallen to just one in ten. Analysis by the Office for National Statistics shows home ownership has roughly halved for younger age groups, only rising among pensioners (file picture) The number of homeowners aged 25 to 34 has also dropped sharply, from two-thirds to less than half. Even older age groups are struggling to save for deposits and obtain mortgages, according to the ONS. Between 1991 and 2011, the number of homeowners aged 35 to 44 fell from three-quarters to two-thirds, while there was a small drop for those aged 45 to 64. By contrast, home ownership increased among the over-65s during the same period, rising from just over half to almost three-quarters. The ONS said one contributing factor behind the decline in the number of young buyers was the rise in the value of deposits needed to secure a mortgage. The date reflects soaring house prices and tougher lending rules, which have made it harder to secure a home loan with a small deposit (file picture) This reflects soaring house prices and tougher lending rules, which have made it harder to secure a home loan with a small deposit. House building has also been in long-term decline since 1980, dropping off significantly following the recession. This has put pressure on housing stock, pushing up prices. The report said: ‘House prices have been increasing and first-time buyers are finding it more difficult to get on the property ladder, while home ownership among younger age groups generally has declined.’ But despite the doom and gloom, prospects for first-time buyers seem to be improving. Separate figures reported yesterday estimated that more than 300,000 people took their first step on the property ladder last year. According to the data, released by Halifax, 2014 saw the highest number of first-time buyers since 2007. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) also revealed that an estimated £205.6billion-worth of mortgages were granted last year to all types of borrowers – the largest sum lent since 2008. The overall value of home loans advanced during 2014 was 17 per cent higher than the £176billion-worth of deals handed out in 2013, it said. CML economist Bob Pannell said the 300,000 first-time buyers were a ‘key driver’ of last year’s market recovery. He admitted that it was still a ‘far cry from the half million that we might regard as normal’, but said it was a step in the right direction.","In 1991, one in three aged 16 to 24 owned a home; in 2011, it was one in ten .

"Match.com has deleted the dating profile of New York's 'cannibal cop'. Gilberto Valle, 30, who was found guilty of using police resources to search women for his online abduction and death-porn fantasies, had set up an online dating profile. (Seeking slender women, who drink moderately, aged 24 -32). But it appears that  the global online dating service was unwilling to extend its promise of 'More Dates, More Relationships, More Marriages' to the disgraced cop, and shut down his profile late on Wednesday. In a statement to Daily Mail Online on Thursday, Match.com said: 'We received a number of complaints about this profile, alerting us to its existence, and have removed it.' Scroll down for video . What a catch! Former NYPD officer Gilberto Valle, dubbed the 'cannibal cop' during his trial for conspiring to abduct, cook and eat women, had his Match.com profile shut down late on Wednesday . Big appetite: The 30-year-old named one of his hobbies as cooking in his active online dating profile. The site later shut down his profile . Valle, who went by the handle 'AmicableOne14', had described himself as 'motivated and passionate about working hard'. He added: 'I am spending my energy rebounding from the errors I made in my past and rebuilding my life.' He also professes that cooking and dining out are among his interests. Valle has been out of jail since July after being cleared of conspiring to abduct, cook and eat women. His trial included lurid details of how he sought advice from others in the online 'death-porn' community over how to kidnap, kill and eat his wife and friends. He was sentenced to time served in November for illegally accessing a federal database. He was also given a year's probation on a charge of misusing police resources to search for women as part of his fantasies. Valle was ordered to continue mental health treatment and was banned from contacting women involved in the case. 'I really want to say I am sorry - it was not a crime but it was wrong,' Valle said outside court in November. Looking for love: The disgraced cop has been out of jail since July but is still on probation for misusing police resources to search for women in his fantasies . On his now-defunct dating profile page, Valle had explained that his ideal woman is 'non-judgmental' with a 'positive outlook on life', adding: 'You appreciate the simple things and can make the best out of a situation that is less than ideal.' He wrote that he works in sales and marketing, is divorced and has a child who lives away from home. His political views were noted as conservative and his last read was 'The Art of Thinking Clearly' by Rolf Dobelli. Among the pictures on the dating profile included several images with a woman cropped out, but still partially visible, another of him petting a dog and a snap of a karaoke performance. There is even a shot which appears to be Valle walking into a court appearance being chased by TV cameras and photographers. The profile appeared to be genuine, despite Valle claiming that he didn't know anything about it, when asked by the New York Post. When shown his Match.com profile, he added: 'I don’t want to see it, thanks.' And it appears Match.com were convinced it was genuine since the site quickly pulled the profile. Valle explained that his ideal woman is 'non-judgmental' with a 'positive outlook on life', in his Match.com dating profile - but the dating service did not think he was a suitable fit . During his trial, the jury heard how Valle communicated in chat rooms about killing and cooking his wife. He told one man he met in a fetish chat room: 'I want her to experience being cooked alive. She'll be trussed up like a turkey. ... She'll be terrified, screaming and crying.' In another exchange, Valle suggested a woman he knew would be easy prey because she lived alone. The chat room discussion centered on cooking the victim, basted in olive oil, over an open fire and using her severed head as a centerpiece for a sit-down meal. Valle had been facing life in prison but the charges were thrown out in July, with the judge writing that ' more likely than not the case that all of Valle's Internet communications about kidnapping are fantasy role-play'. Valle, 30, (pictured outside court in November) was cleared of conspiring to kidnap, kill, cook and eat women but put on a year's probation for misusing police resources to search for woman for his fantasies . The former cop's defense lawyers said Valle recognized that the substance of his Internet chats was 'deeply troubling and disturbing' and now meets weekly with a counselor to discuss it. They added: 'Gil does not want his life's legacy to be the story of the ''Cannibal Cop.'' 'He is only 30 years old and intends to make something more out of his life. Inspired by the team of people who defended his innocence, Gil wants to go to law school.' Valle, then a patrolman for the NYPD, was arrested in October 2012 after his wife found disturbing pictures on his computer that he had downloaded from the site DarkFetishNet.com. The FBI found a list of 100 women he said he planned to kill, cook and eat. They also found a transcript of an online chat in which he said he planned to take his 'girlfriend' Kathleen to Pakistan, where he and another man would murder her and cannibalize her body. Valle maintains that his extensive writings were nothing more than fantasy - never meant to be acted on or carried out. Valle's ex-wife, who testified against her husband at trial, was granted a divorce last July. She took the couple's young daughter and completely cut off contact with Valle and his family.

"Carloee Hickman (left) and her husband Albert (right) have been jailed for a total of 34 years . A couple who used 'black magic' to convince an 11-year-old girl to take part in sex sessions where they sucked her blood have been jailed for 34 years. Carolee Hickman, 64, from St Athan, South Wales, told the schoolgirl that she was part of a powerful witches' coven before forcing her to have sex with her husband Albert, 65. The victim had repressed memories of the abuse, which took place between 1972 and 1975, until they came back during counselling for bereavement and depression in 2011. She told Cardiff Crown Court last month that Mrs Hickman had a special 'bejewelled knife', which she used to cut the young girl's thumb before sucking her blood. The court heard the couple invited the teenage girl into their house where they discussed black magic and did tarot card readings with her. Mrs Hickman would threaten to kill her mother, who was suffering from cancer at the time, with a curse. The Hickman's then assaulted the girl every week for almost a year, and together planned to rape the young victim. Mrs Hickman pinned her arms above her head and took 'delight in the terrible, terrible rape' carried out by her husband. The victim, who cannot be identified, said the horror of what happened to her while at school had been buried for 40 years - before her memories resurfaced. Now in her 50s, she said in an impact statement: '42-years-ago a little girl met two evil people who took advantage of her. 'My life has been destroyed at their hands.' The woman said she went to the Hickman's, who now live in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, house aged 11 while skipping school with friends. The couple allegedly gave the girl and her friends 'pagan crosses' to wear before plying them with cigarettes and alcohol. She told a trial: 'Carolee said she was a witch and would come and get me and would make my mother ill - she even said she could kill my mother if she wanted to. 'She had a knife with a jewelled handle kept in a wooden box with carvings on the top. She cut my hand and sucked the blood out of it. 'There were tarot cards she used to tell our fortunes and she even had a black cape.' Cardiff Crown Court (above) heard at an earlier hearing how Carolee, 64, used 'black magic' to force the girl into submission while her husband repeatedly raped her . The girl tried to report the Hickmans to police following the sex attack at their home near Cardiff but officers dismissed her claims, taking the view that a married woman would not have been capable of doing what Mrs Hickman had. Passing sentence at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court today, Judge Daniel William said: 'You were a couple united by a deep seated and overwhelming abuse of children. 'You groomed her and gained her trust, you told her you had supernatural powers and that she was the ""chosen one"" and you put the fear of god into her. 'It was a specific targeting of a vulnerable victim and threats were made which petrified her.' Hickman, who used to work as an engineer for the RAF, was given a 17-year sentence and his wife was found guilty of indecent assault and aiding and abetting rape and given a matching 17 years. The court heard that Mr Hickman had raped a young girl in 1982 after leaving the RAF and joining the Fire Service and had been jailed for 10 years for the crime. The jury was also told Mrs Hickman was jailed for five years in 1982 after admitting holding down a child while she was raped as part of 'devil worship' which required a virgin girl. Judge Williams said of the victim: 'Your claims were dismissed without proper investigation. 'Had you been taken seriously it may have prevented the abuse which the Hickmans carried out in the 1980s.' The judge also said the woman had shown tremendous courage in coming forward and giving evidence in the Hickmans' trial.","Carolee Hickman, 64, forced girl to have sex with her husband Albert, 65 .

"Mentally-ill sex offender Ferdinand Manila (pictured in an e-fit) attacked two woman last year and has now been given an indefinite hospital order . A sex attacker has been locked up after one of his victims bit off his tongue, which was later used to provide vital DNA evidence. Ferdinand Manila, 28, pounced on the woman as she walked along an alleyway in Dunstable, Bedfordshire in January last year. But she sank her teeth into his tongue and Manila fled with blood running from his mouth. The victim, 28, spat out the piece of flesh but kept it to give to police. Mentally-ill Manila went on to assault a second woman later the same day, grabbing a 55-year-old from behind and stroking her. He was caught two months later when he was arrested on suspicion of three separate offences, of which he was later cleared by a jury. Luton Crown Court heard police kept the piece of tongue and matched his DNA to the earlier attacks. Judge Barbara Mensah said: 'He approached the first victim in an alleyway and forced his tongue into her mouth. 'She bravely bit some of it off and removed it from her mouth later on and took it to police. 'It has caused serious psychological harm. His first victim took a big risk when she bit off a part of Mr Manila's tongue. 'This was very distressing for her. The public needs to be protected from the nature of these offences that can cause serious psychological harm.' Manila, of Dunstable, was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault against the two women and was given an indefinite hospital order. The court heard Manila was being detained in psychiatric hospital Oak Tree Manor in Essex where he continued to act inappropriately. Part of Manila's tongue was bitten off during an attack in this alleyway in Dunstable in January last year . Psychiatric professionals at the hospital reported that he has said that he wanted to peel the skin off people. They also said he makes sexual comments to female staff and derogatory comments to male staff. The woman who bit off Manila's tongue said she was determined to get as much evidence about him as possible. She said: 'I fought him off as much as I could and wanted to leave as much evidence as possible on his body and my body to show that it was not consensual in any way, shape or form. 'I wanted to gather as much evidence as I could - under my nails, by biting his tongue - so that police could catch him. 'Initially, he went in for a kiss, but then as soon as I started fighting back and biting and scratching him that's when he tried to make the sexual advances. It freaked me out.' The woman lost her place at university as she took time off deal with the trauma of the attack, but now hopes to start again. Luton Crown Court heard Manila has talked about 'peeling off people's skin' since he was hospitalised . The victim added: 'The incident, from when it happened to when he was caught, was very tough. 'I was afraid to leave the house, constantly looking over my shoulder, I couldn't get any college work done and ultimately lost my place at university. 'But, I can't live my life in constant fear, otherwise I'd be letting people like him win.' Extraordinarily, she says she has now forgiven Manila for his crime. She added: 'I know he's really sick and I'm glad that he's in the hospital, it's the best place for him. Hopefully it means that he can get better in the future and start his life over like I'm hoping to now.'","Woman attacked as she walked down an alleyway in Dunstable last year .

"A teenage thug who was caught on CCTV torturing two husky dogs has been jailed for 17 weeks by a judge who told him: 'I wouldn't trust you with a goldfish'. William Legget, 19, of Bedminster, Bristol, tied adult dog Balue to a bannister and punched, stamped and kicked her before turning on his puppy Nala, who he beat and threatened with a knife. The older dog escaped serious injury but Nala suffered a broken hip, jaw, cheek and a fractured skull. William Legget has been jailed after being caught on CCTV beating and severely injuring his husky dogs . District Judge Lynne Matthews jailed Legget for 17 weeks after telling him he was 'not a decent human being'. She said she was 'staggered' by his cruelty and imposed a life ban on him keeping any animals, adding she 'would not trust him with a goldfish'. She also said the case should be reported to social services after hearing that Legget had a young child.

Judge Matthews said: 'With the puppy it wasn't a slight fracture but the bone has broken away. 'The veterinary surgeon said that break was a result of extreme force. You applied that extreme force.' Legget admitted three counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal and two counts of failing to protect it from pain, suffering and injury. John Stokes, defending, said his client had both emotional and behavioural problems but had a partner and a young child to look after. Legget was jailed for 17 weeks.

"Twin 9-year-old boys were left mostly alone in their New Hampshire apartment for four months after their parents took three siblings to Nigeria and left an uncle to care for them, authorities said Thursday. Manchester police said the uncle, 25-year-old Giobari Atura, told them he would stop by every couple of days to drop off food, but when police got involved in November, they found no edible food in the refrigerator and only ramen noodles in a cabinet. Atura was charged in December with one count of endangering the welfare of a child and  was freed on $500 bail. 25-year-old Giobari Atura (above) was charged with endangering the welfare of a child as he abandoned his two nephews while their parents were overseas . The apartment building in Manchester, New Hampshire where two twins were left home alone . Atura's older brother, Jerusalem Monday, left for Nigeria with his wife and three of their children in July, intending to return in August. They told police they were delayed by illness and passport problems. A neighbor, Christaly Garcia, said she didn't recall seeing the boys but noted they wouldn't necessarily stand out because there are a lot of kids in the well-kept apartment complex in New Hampshire's largest city. The case came to light in November when officials at the boys' school told the state Division of Children, Youth and Families that the twins had been living on their own for months. The kids were getting themselves up and on the bus, then eating breakfast and lunch at school. The boys were taken into protective custody and then placed into foster care. It wasn't immediately clear whether they were still in foster care, whether the parents had returned from Nigeria or whether they could face charges. In a police affidavit, Atura said he'd stop by the apartment on days that he went to work, but that didn't happen every day. He said he checked on the boys three days a week and told them to call him if they needed anything. ""It should be noted that no operable phone was located within the apartment,"" the affidavit says. In an interview with police, one of the boys said ""he felt lonely while staying at their own house because his mom and dad were not there and nobody was with them,"" according to the affidavit. When police finally reached the parents, they said they had instructed Atura to stay at the apartment, and if he couldn't, they gave him the name of a family friend to contact. The parents said they stayed in phone contact with Atura, who assured them everything was fine. His phone number isn't listed, and it wasn't immediately clear if he had a lawyer.","Twin 9-year-old boys were left mostly alone in their New Hampshire apartment for four months after their parents took three siblings to Nigeria .

"A 13-year-old Northeast Texas boy has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for killing his 12-year-old biological brother and their adoptive father. The boy, from Cass County, whose name has not been released because of his age, shot both family members. He pleaded guilty at a January 9 hearing to two counts of capital murder according to Cass County District Attorney Randal Lee. A 13-year-old Northeast Texas boy has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for killing his 12-year-old biological brother and their adoptive father. The boy, from Cass County, whose name has not been released because of his age, shot both family members at their home (pictured) The case dates back to last summer, and is described by Lee as: 'pretty cold-blooded', and 'right up there with some of the adult murders I've seen', The Longview News-Journal reported. The teen will remain in juvenile custody until he's 19, when he'll be transferred to an adult prison. Cass County Sheriff Larry Rowe said he was satisfied with the guilty plea. However, he added that local law enforcement struggle to understand laws that could allow the boy out of prison much earlier than an adult who committed the same crime. Cass County Sheriff Larry Rowe said he was satisfied with the guilty plea . A plea bargain lowered the sentencing to 25 years from a maximum of 40 years. Members of the teen's family are reportedly on board with the deal and gave victim impact statements at the January 9 hearing. Many in the small town are questioning what an appropriate punishment is for such a horrific crime. 'We don't understand in law enforcement why someone 13 years old can do that and possibly be out of jail by the time they're 30,' Rowe told the Longview News-Journal. The plea bargain was worked out before District Attorney Lee took office on January 1, 2015. Police were first called to the victims' home near Hughes Springs at 10:42 p.m. on June 27, 2014, after a 911 call by the 13-year-old. They found two bodies – 32-year-old Damon Robison, and his adopted 12-year-old son – who were found with gunshot wounds near the kitchen of the property. Police found a semiautomatic pistol at the scene. There were no signs of a break-in and nothing appeared to be missing. The 13-year-old boy was reported to be uninjured. The adoptive mother of the two boys, Donna Robison, their biological grandmother, was away at work at the time of the shooting. Her husband was a mechanic at Pittsburg Tractor. The boys' birth mother is named as Sarah Curto of Naples, Texas. At the time officials were unclear as to what the circumstances were that had led to the shooting. The surviving boy was detained for questioning, but released. He was rearrested on October 1 after police located witnesses who told them that he had admitted to the killings. Immediately after the two murders the teen reportedly tried to manipulate the crime scene by cutting his own arm with a knife and then placing the knife in his adoptive father's hand, said Lee. The teen then told police that Robison attacked him and his brother, and that he shot Robison while defending himself. Prosecutors say the teen had planned to only kill his father, but his brother walked in, and he killed him too. Given the boy's age, Lee found the two murders as disturbing in their calculation and premeditation as anything he had seen in his legal career. 'It’s just horrendous,' he said.","The teen intended to kill his adoptive father, Damon Robison, but also shot his 12-year-old brother who walked in on the crime .

"Joseph Edwards, 17, who had autism, was found hanged at his home in Berkshire after receiving a spam email saying he had viewed indecent images . A 17-year-old with autism hanged himself after opening a scam email which appeared to be from police claiming he had downloaded indecent images and demanding £100. Joseph Edwards, an A-level student from Windsor, Berkshire, likely didn't understand that the message was fake because of his learning difficulty, a coroner said. Police say it will be almost impossible to trace the fraudsters behind the 'crude' email , but believe it may have originated from abroad. The 17-year-old was found hanged at his home by his mother Jacqueline who has since launched a campaign to make children more aware of the dangers from internet scams. Battling through tears, she told the hearing at Windsor Guildhall her son had been a 'happy boy.' She added: 'He was generally happy and had just started new friendship circles and was enjoying himself,” she told the coroner. 'He didn’t seem to have any worries known to me. I don’t think he really understood. He did suffer from autism. I’m not sure he would have really understood the implications of what he was doing. 'He wouldn’t have done anything to upset myself or his sister, not deliberately.' Ms Edwards told the hearing how, after finding his body, she had run screaming into the street. The noise attracted a neighbour, truck driver Lee Jobson, who came to help, and called the emergency services. Police seized the teenager’s laptop, along with a note he had left. Coroner Michael Burgess said: 'It seems that from examining the computer that there appeared to be some sort of scam on it. 'He had inadvertently clicked onto this and it seemed to be, according to the police, ""a poor attempt at blackmail."" It (his autism) may have meant he took it very seriously.' People with the developmental disability often do not understand sarcasm or lies and take things very literally. Detective Sergeant Peter Wall, investigating the scam, said it was very difficult to trace those responsible but that police believe it originated abroad. It was thought Joseph received a spam email which demanded money and downloaded a virus onto his computer. The message came with a Cheshire Police logo, despite the fact that he lived in Berkshire, which is served by Thames Valley Police. A coroner said that because of his autism, Joseph likely took the message seriously and became distressed, despite police describing it as 'a poor attempt at fraud' The scam wrongly claimed indecent images had been found in Joseph’s possession and he would have to pay up to prevent the 'police' taking things further. Fearing causing his mother and sister Georgia distress, the traumatised young boy, who was studying his A-levels at Windsor Boys’ School, instead took his own life, the inquest heard. A post-mortem investigation showed the youngster had died from asphyxia as a result of hanging. 'Joseph was subjected to a scam on the internet, a threatening, fake police link that was asking for money,' his mother said in a statement. 'He would have taken it literally because of his autism and he didn’t want to upset Georgia or me. 'The internet is an amazing thing, but it can also be dangerous and I want parents to make sure their children are aware of this sort of scam, especially autistic children, because they will not understand. 'Jospeh was a very loving boy. He had a quirky sense of humour, and was just starting to develop his confidence and in many ways he was a typical teenager, despite being autistic. Joseph's mother, Jacqueline, has now set up a campaign to teach teenagers about the dangers of internet scams . 'He was a sensible, calm, kind and gentle boy - those are all words people are using about him, but his friends have also told me they will remember him as a ‘crazy dancer.' Joseph, a keen football fan, had attended a mainstream school, despite his autism diagnosis, and the family had been planning to travel to New York together to celebrate his 18th birthday. Recording an open verdict into Joseph’s death, coroner Michael Burgess said: 'Taking all this evidence into account, I am satisfied that on the 6th of August you found him at his home in the hallway. 'I’m not satisfied that he necessarily understood the implications that he would die from it. Although he undertook that action himself, his intention is not clear from the evidence. 'It’s what we call an open verdict. I’m sure and hope you will remember him for the better moments of his life than for the way that he died.' After Joseph’s death, a Facebook page was set up called 'Fake Police Email Scam in Memory of Joseph Edwards.' A statement said: 'On August 6 2014 Joseph Edwards, received a fake email scam from Cheshire Police (Ukash Scam) informing him that he had been visiting illegal websites, which also generated a virus locking his laptop. 'He was asked to pay a sum of £100 or face being prosecuted. These emails are sent on headed paper from police authorities on both a national and global basis. 'This message was designed to look extremely convincing due to the official police headed paper. 'Joseph, who suffered from Autistic Spectrum Disorder, was so distressed by the accusation and by the demand for money sadly took his own life. 'This page is set up for a plea for more action to be taken against such websites and for the prosecution of those responsible for them. 'Also to raise awareness of the dangers these sites present, not only to children but also to older people and many others may be vulnerable to this sort of extortion. 'We must do more to stop this, please share this to raise awareness. Thank you.'","Joseph Edwards, 17, hanged himself at home in Windsor, Berkshire .

"If you had to choose, who would you least want to travel with? According to a new survey, Britons have selected their in-laws as the worst possible holiday companion... with bosses and ex-partners not far behind. And when it comes to the type of holiday they'd most like to avoid, many were quick to state that a cruise would be the absolute worst. According to Britons polled by sunshine.co.uk, a cruise with in-laws would be their least desirable holiday . In the survey, conducted by sunshine.co.uk, camping and cottage or villa-style breaks were also listed as the worst type of holiday to go on if accompanied by their least favourite holidaymaker. The online travel agency also found that two-thirds of those who said their in-laws were the worst possible holiday companion had, perhaps unsurprisingly, been on holiday with them before. The poll was conducted as part of an ongoing study into the holiday habits of those around the UK. Sunshine.co.uk polled 1,668 Britons, all of whom were aged 18 and over. Is this you? Not likely! 54% of respondents replied that in-laws would make the worst holiday companions . 1. In-laws - 54% . 2. Bosses - 38% . 3. Ex-Partners - 37% . 4. Parents - 25% . 5. Children - 19% . Initially, all respondents were asked to provide details of their worst possible companion to travel with and those polled could select all answers that they felt were applicable. Those who selected in-laws were then asked to provide reasons for their choice. The majority (45 per cent) said that they did not 'see eye-to-eye' with them, while 31 per cent noted that their 'preferred holiday activities would differ.' Coming in close behind, those polled agreed that taking an ex-partner on holiday would be terrible as well . Twenty one per cent confessed that they simply 'would not be able to relax' if accompanied by their in-laws on holiday. The survey then asked exactly what type of holiday would the absolute worst to go on with such an undesirable companion. Fifty six per cent of respondents stated that a cruise would be the worst, while 27 per cent admitted that they'd least like to go camping. Seventeen per cent agreed that a cottage or villa break together would be most unpleasant. Another less than desirable travel partner? Your boss, according to 38 per cent of those surveyed . Chris Clark, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk, said: 'We all know what it might be like to go on holiday with people who we think could be annoying; after all, there is little opportunity to escape.' 'The results do make for tough reading for those with sons or daughters in-law, as it appears that the old-fashioned jokes about the in-laws still ring true today. 'It's not surprising that holidays spent in close confinement are the least favoured, so there is still hope for having a holiday with the in-laws and enjoying it, so long as you each have your own space. 'As with anything, if you're planning a holiday with others, make sure you take into account everyone's tastes so no one feels they've missed out on having a great holiday.'","Sunshine.co.uk found 54% polled least want to travel with their in-laws .

"People who haven't been vaccinated against measles, including children too young to be immunized, should avoid Disneyland after new infections were linked to the theme park, California public health officials said on Wednesday. So far, 70 people in five U.S. states and Mexico have contracted measles in an outbreak that was traced to West Coast Disney parks in December and has since spread into the community. The vast majority of infections — 62 — occurred in California, and the tally is expected to rise. Because measles is highly contagious, people who have not received the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine are susceptible and should avoid visiting Disneyland 'for the time being,' state epidemiologist Gil Chavez said. Stay home:  California public health officials are urging those who haven't been vaccinated against the disease, including children too young to be immunized, to avoid Disney parks in the state . The same holds true for crowded places with a high concentration of international travelers, such as airports, Chavez said. People who are vaccinated don't need to take such precautions, he said. Disneyland Resorts spokeswoman Suzi Brown said officials agreed with the advice that 'it's absolutely safe to visit if you're vaccinated.' The people who have been infected range in age from 7 months to 70 years old. The vast majority were not vaccinated, and a quarter had to be hospitalized. Among those sickened were five Disney employees. Three have since returned to work. Safe: Those who have been vaccinated against the measles vaccine should feel safe visiting Disney and crowded places and likely won't be infected with the disease . The company previously said park employees who may have been in contact with those infected were asked to show proof of vaccination or have a blood test to show immunity against measles. Those with pending results were put on paid leave. Vaccinations are also being offered to all employees. Measles has hit California hard recently. The state typically sees four to 60 measles cases a year. 'We are off to a bad start in 2015,' ,Chavez said. Since the outbreak, two dozen unvaccinated students at an Orange County high school were sent home for three weeks after an infected pupil showed up. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can spread by air through coughing or sneezing. Symptoms include fever followed by cough, runny nose and a blotchy rash. Though the virus has been eradicated in the U.S. since 2000, it can still enter the country through an infected traveler. While health officials said they likely may never find 'patient zero' or the trigger of the outbreak, they believe it was either a resident from a country where measles is widespread or a Californian who went abroad and brought home the virus. People at highest risk are those who are unvaccinated, pregnant women, infants under 6 months old, and those with weakened immune systems.","So far, 70 people in five U.S. states and Mexico have contracted measles in an outbreak that was traced to Disneyland in December .

"U.S. astronauts are already blasting off to the International Space Station on Russian rockets. But now the Federal Communications Commission is weighing a plan to use Moscow-based satellites to route America's 911 emergency phone calls. Congressional Republicans, already skittish about trusting the Vladimir Putin regime as it airs its expansionist desires through Europe, fear the Russian leader would gain access to real-time information about emergency responders in every corner of the United States. That data, piped through Russia's GLONASS precision navigation and timing satellite system, already allows police, fire and rescue crews to pinpoint cellphone callers' locations. National security alarms are going off, and they're as loud as fire bells. Alabama Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, who chairs am Armed Services subcommittee on strategic forces, wrote to warn Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. FROM MOSCOW WITH LOVE: Russian satellites could soon carry the navigation signals that help first responders locate 911 cellphone callers in the United States . RAW POWER: National Security hawks fret that Russian president Vladimir Putin could collect data showing where U.S. emergency response crews are located in the event of a military confrontation . 'In view of the threat posed to the world by Russia's Vladimir Putin, it cannot be seriously considered that the U.S. would rely on a system in that dictator's control for its wireless 911 location capability,' Rogers wrote, in a letter first reporter by The Washington Times. 'Our response to Russia's hybrid warfare, arms control cheating, illegal invasions of sovereign nations, and energy-based extortion must be broad-based isolation and counter-leverage.' A trade group that worked on the plan with major wireless phone carriers – including AT&T Mobility, Sprint, T-Mobile USA and Verizon – disagrees. Trey Fogarty, government affairs director at the National Emergency Number Association, said there's no American satellite system that can cover enough ground on its own without help from GLONASS. His group worked with the companies and the Association of Public Safety Communications Officials (APSCO) to develop a way to give police, firefighters and medics better tools to locate people in time to help them when seconds count. 'Our view is that we ought to be leveraging anything that is available to find someone in an emergency,' Fogarty told the Times. APSCO says Rep. Rogers is overreacting based on 'plainly false statements that stretch the imagination to try to make a case that the roadmap's inclusion of GLONASS for location determination presents a security threat.' That stark condemnation came from the association's government relations chief, Jeffrey Cohen, in a Dec. 24 letter to the FCC. Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers is warning the FCC that it shouldn't let cellphone companies route 911 calls through satellites under the control of the Russian Federation . GLONASS itself is an alternative GPS system operated by 24 satellites, with 4 more planned. In April 2014 the entire system went offline for a half-day, leading everyone from Russian military planes to commercial shippers to generate incorrect location data – which was in some cases off by more than 50 kilometers. Russia Today, a state-funded news outlet, reports that Moscow began developing GLONASS in 1976 and reached the point where it could cover the entire planet's surface in 1995. A total of 19 ground stations collect satellite data for consumer applications, providing signals with accuracy up to one meter. 'Three more stations are located in the Antarctic and one in Brazil,' according to RT, 'with two more to be constructed in Kazakhstan and one in Belarus.' Yesterday SU-25 fighter jets carried test modules over the skies of northern Kyrgyzstan on practice runs to demonstrate its military applications. It's the largest and only comprehensive GPS-workalike system in existence, according to Russian media outlets, which also report that its underlying technology has been shared with North Korea and Belarus. Sprint sait it aims to minimize the degree to which American companies rely on the Russian satellites. 'The roadmap does not envision that carriers will rely exclusively on the GLONASS system,' the company's government affairs director Ray Rothermel wrote on Dec. 24 to FCC officials. 'Rather, the roadmap advocates taking advantage of a tool that is available now to allow carriers to improve location information.' COMRADE COMMUNICATIONS: Russia's GPS-workalike satellites could guide big-city firetrucks to their destinations – or not, if the software fails again, or if Russian controllers decide to monkeywrench it . GLONASS is powered by more than two dozen geosynchronous-orbiting satellites launched on Russian rockets since the 1970s . The FCC has the authority to green-light or spike the proposal, but hasn't chosen a path forward yet. A January 29 meeting, however, could bring the issue to a head. Retired Rear Admiral David Simpson, chief of the FCC's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, said his agency is 'committed to protecting both public safety and national security as we continue to examine the input and issues in the proceeding, and will coordinate with our colleagues across the government to ensure that national security needs are addressed.' The Pentagon has found itself blind-sided in the past by concerns about handing Russia the keys to U.S.-based signals intelligence. In 2013 the State Department said it was considering giving Roscomos – the Russian space agency – clearance to erect six buildings in the U.S. outfitted with with antennas and signal processing electronics. Members of Congress were outraged and wrote special language into the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act forbidding such deals with foreign nations.","Russia's own GPS system covers more ground than US satellites, so wireless phone companies want to leverage it to help locate 911 callers .
Rep. Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican, is furious and says the move could give signals intelligence to an antagonistic Russian Federation .

"The boisterous spectators at the Australian Open are being accused of distracting the players and being disrespectful, with many people now calling for their removal from the matches. The rowdy fans have been screamed at by players, escorted out of the stadium by security guards and berated by umpires - yet the group refuse to desist. The group, aptly-named 'The Fanatics', make their presence known at every match and are renowned for their emphatic enthusiasm. The fiercely patriotic Aussies shout, chant and dress up in bright, obnoxious costumes. However, many insist their out-of-hand behaviour is far from funny. Notably, both Russian Alexander Kudryavtsev and Latvian Ernests Gulbis furiously blamed the Fanatics for playing a part in each of their first round defeats.

"With thousands of anti-abortion protesters in town for the annual March for Life, Republicans were ready to push legislation through the House designed to please them. GOP leaders had planned House passage Thursday of legislation criminalizing most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, an act that would have defied a White House veto threat. But late Wednesday they abruptly postponed that confrontation indefinitely after concluding they were short of votes from their own caucus, after several women pushed back on a provision that would have required rape and incest victims seeking an abortion after 20 weeks to first report the crime to the police. Instead, the House will vote on legislation today barring taxpayer funding of abortions — a prohibition that's already largely in place. Republicans say the bill will tighten the restrictions and make sure no funds flow to abortions under President Barack Obama's health care law. Anti-abortion activists stage a 'die-in' in front of the White House on Wednesday. Today marks the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that established a nationwide right to abortion. Every anniversary anti-abortion activists flood D.C. and embark on a march from the National Mall to the Supreme Court in protest of court ruling . The delayed bill would have allowed exemptions to the late-term abortion ban for victims of rape or incest and in cases when a woman's life was in danger. But GOP leaders ran into problems when some GOP women, including Rep. Rene Ellmers of North Carolina and Rep. Jackie Walorski of Indiana, and other lawmakers argued that requiring victims to contact the police put unfair pressure on those who have already suffered. A 2013 Justice Department report calculated that only 35 percent of rapes and sexual assaults were reported to police. The statistics also served as the basis for the White House's veto threat. Political pressures cut both ways for Republicans. Leaders had resisted the awkwardness of postponing a high-profile abortion vote scheduled for the day of anti-abortion activists' annual march to the Supreme Court to protest its 1973 decision legalizing the procedure. And they didn't want to push anti-abortion legislation through the House that was opposed by GOP women, especially as the party tries appealing to more female voters ahead of the 2016 elections. Yet when the leaders considered eliminating the requirement that rapes and incest be previously reported, they encountered objections from anti-abortion groups, Republican aides said. They chose not to anger that powerful GOP constituency. The breakdown showcased GOP leaders' struggles to keep its members united the Republican-led Congress attempts to govern efficiently and avoid gridlock. 'I’m honestly stunned — what a complete and utter debacle,' one conservative lawmaker who planned to vote for the postponed bill told National Review Online. 'I don't see it as a failure. I see it as a victory in the process for getting legislation right,' Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a sponsor of the postponed bill, said in an interview with the AP. Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, expressed disappointment that 'a handful'  of lawmakers had forced a delay in the late-term abortion restrictions but added, 'We applaud the leadership for remaining committed to advancing pro-life legislation.' Perkins made a last-minute visit to the Capitol on Wednesday to meet with Republicans' chief vote counter. The conservative big wig told the Washington Post  that a 'lot of misconceptions' were involved in the kerfuffle. 'We’re talking about a measure that would limit abortions after five months,' he said. 'America is only one of four nations that allows abortions throughout the entire pregnancy.' Sen. Barbara Boxer, right, speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday, along with women's health advocates to denounce 'Republican attacks on women's health' and the House's plans to vote on 'an extreme abortion ban.' Sen. Patty Murray listens at left. The House abandoned its plans to take a vote on the legislation late last night . Progressive groups and a handful of Democratic lawmakers that included Sens. Barbara Boxer of California, Patty Murray of Washington and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, held a press conference on Wednesday to denounce 'Republican attacks on women's health' and the House's plans to vote on 'an extreme abortion ban.' After House Republicans backtracked, congressional Democrats who solidly oppose the legislation, along with abortion-rights advocates, all but mocked the GOP's problem. Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern said Republicans suffered 'a meltdown.' Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said of the bill, 'These attacks are so dangerous, extreme and unpopular that House Republicans can't even get their membership lined up behind them.' The National Organization for Women celebrated the victory in an email to supporters on Thursday, claiming GOP had to 'pull that bill because even members in their own party thought it was too extreme!' Referencing the legislation that the House plans to pass instead, NOW insisted 'they haven't learned their lesson - they are still trying to strip women of their rights.' House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters this morning that the new bill, banning health insurance funds from being spent on abortion, is 'much worse' than the legislation Republicans originally intended to pass today because it affects millions of women instead of thousands. 'This isn't about any improvement because of the actions that were taken yesterday,' she said. 'It makes matters worse.' Pelosi said the legislation 'undermines the ability of of a woman to use her own money from her own insurance' to pay for her own reproductive services. 'This was not a success for women and their reproductive health,' she said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters this morning that the new bill Republicans plan to vote on today, which bans health insurance funds from being spent on abortion, is 'much worse' than the legislation Republicans originally intended to pass . The 20 week abortion band had virtually no chance of becoming law, thanks to opposition from President Barack Obama and an uncertain fate in the Senate, where anti-abortion sentiment is less pronounced. The White House said Wednesday it was advising the president to veto the bill because it 'unacceptably restrict women's health and reproductive rights and is an assault on a woman's right to choose.' 'Furthermore, the provision that requires rape and incest survivors to report the crime to a law enforcement agency or child welfare authority in order to have access to an abortion after the 20-week mark demonstrates a complete disregard for the women who experience sexual assault and the barriers they may face in reporting,' it said in a statement of administration policy. 'Research indicates that the majority of survivors have not reported their sexual assaults to law enforcement.' House Republicans consider the bill an important statement of their priorities and a show of support for a vital issue for conservatives, though, and were ready to press on, despite threats from the White House. Supporters named their measure the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. But Democrats touted arguments by doctors' groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which have cited research indicating that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain until the third trimester, which starts around the 28th week. And a report Tuesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office suggested that the majority of women now having abortions after five weeks would move up their timeline instead of abandoning the procedure altogether. Citing the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CBO estimated that about 10,000 abortions annually are performed 20 weeks or later into pregnancies. The budget office estimated that if the bill became law, three-fourths of those abortions would instead occur before the 20th week.","Thousands of anti-abortion protesters are in town for the annual March for Life; Republicans were ready to push legislation designed to please them .

"Hershey's has launched a legal battle to drive British chocolate brands out of New York City. The American candy firm claims snacks like Cadbury's Creme Eggs, Nestle Toffee Crisp bars and Nestle Yorkie bars from across the Atlantic are too similarly packaged to their own products - and do not adhere to FDA guidelines. If successful, the bid would strip British specialist stores such as Tea & Sympathy and Myers Of Keswick, in New York's West Village, of one of their key selling points. According to Hershey's, LLB Imports has already agreed to block Cadbury's from US borders and they are pressing to drive out other products including Maltesers and Rolo. Controversy: The Hershey's Co. claims they have exclusive rights to make its own FDA-approved version of Cadbury's Creme Eggs under the same name. The law suit has enraged British specialist stores . Affecting business: New York City's British store Tea & Sympathy are petitioning against the law suit . 'It's just another thing to make everybody miserable,' Nicky Perry, owner of Tea & Sympathy, told DNAinfo. 'Why are we having a fight about chocolate? I mean, chocolate!' In the suit against LLB Imports, The Hershey Co. states that it holds exclusive rights to sell their own versions of Creme Eggs, Maltesers, and Rolo chocolates under the same names - but the recipes are different. While Hershey's insists their recipe uniquely adheres to FDA guidelines, Perry insists the British versions taste better. The case also states that Toffee Crisps candy wrappers are too similar to Reese's Peanut Butter Cups' wrappers. 'Too similar': The lawsuit says Toffee Crisp bars are too similarly packaged to Reese's Peanut Butter Cups . Infringement: Hershey's is calling for the British competition to be driven out to protect their brand . And Yorkie bars could be confused with the similarly-named York Peppermint Patties. Enraged customers of Tea & Sympathy took to Facebook. One wrote: 'I'm a proud American but I hate Hershey's and have loved Cadbury's since I was a kid.' Another said: 'Hershey's chocolate is pure garbage ... another attempt to monopolize the market with a substandard product!' 'Sounds the same': Yorkie bars, made in Britain by Nestle, sound the same as York Peppermint Patties . Legal battle: Although York patties are packaged and shaped differently, Hershey's claims it is an infringement . Hershey's spokesman Jeff Beckman said the lawsuit has prompted LBB had already agreed to stop importing British Cadbury products as a result of the lawsuit. 'It is important for Hershey to protect its trademark rights and to prevent consumers from being confused or misled when they see a product name or product package that is confusingly similar to a Hershey name or trade dress,' Beckman said.

Serial sex attacker Francisco Arce Montes, 64, was tried for the attack last Thursday after being extradited to Spain from France where he is serving a 30-year jail sentence for the July 1996 killing of British schoolgirl Caroline Dickinson. The one-day hearing was held behind closed doors after a request from the victim's lawyer for the press and public to be kept out was accepted. Francisco Arce Montes, 64, pictured left in a 2001 U.S. mugshot, and again right in 2004 after he was convicted of the murder of British schoolgirl Caroline Dickinson . Judges at a court in Oviedo, northern Spain, today sentenced Arce Montes to another 11 years behind bars after announcing their decision to convict him in writing. Arce Montes tried to rape his 18-year-old victim by putting a knife to her throat after tricking her into letting him in the block of flats she was holidaying at with her family by claiming he had lost his keys. The August 22, 1997, incident occurred just over a year after he killed Cornish youngster Caroline, 13, in a Brittany youth hostel during a school trip. A neighbour who was returning home from work foiled the attack in Llanes near Oviedo. Arce Montes was arrested minutes later after threatening to kill Good Samaritan Miguel Llera as he fled, but later skipped bail and failed to show up for trial. He has been held at Villabona Prison near Oviedo while judges deliberate their verdict and sentence and is now expected to lodge an appeal being returned to his French jail cell. Javier Dominguez, head of the panel of three judges which tried Arce Montes, described him in a 10-page written ruling as an 'extremely dangerous criminal.' Caroline Dickinson (pictured) was killed by Arce Montes while staying in a Brittany youth hostel during a school trip . He said: 'What the attacker intended was to rape his victim. 'He employed the knife with which he tried to immobilise her by putting it to her neck and showed he was more than prepared to use it with the potentially lethal consequences that could have incurred. 'This court has taken into consideration the fact that we are dealing with an individual who has been arrested for several previous sex offences and is currently serving a jail sentence for a serious incident which caused the death of his victim in France.' Caroline was in a party of 40 pupils and five teachers on an end-of-term school trip staying at a youth hostel in Pleine Fougeres. Former waiter Arce Montes, a drifter born in Gijon in northern Spain, raped her and then suffocated her after entering through a door thought to have been left unlocked. He evaded capture until U.S. police arrested him over a similar attack on an Irish woman tourist in Florida in April 2001. An immigration official at Detroit Airport discovered he was in police custody in Miami Beach after seeing a British newspaper story about the five-year anniversary of Caroline's murder in a British newspaper and doing an immigration search to see if he had ever travelled to the US. Arce Montes' DNA was later matched to DNA samples from the Caroline Dickinson murder investigation, as well as the youth hostel attack on the Irish student and four other similar incidents on Miami Beach. The U.S. authorities later suspended charges against Arce Montes so he could be extradited and charged over Caroline's murder. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison by a court in Rennes in June 2004. As well as the brutal crime against Caroline Dickinson, Arce Montes is also known to have committed assaults in Germany where he was jailed for five years in the mid-eighties for rape, and the Netherlands. Caroline's parents Sue and John Dickinson pictured outside the courthouse in Rennes upon hearing Arce Montes had been found guilty for the murder of their daughter . Authorities in South America also believe he killed and raped at least a dozen women within their borders, besides assaulting many more. He is expected to serve his jail time in Spain once he has been released from prison in France, where he is currently scheduled to stay until January 2027. A witness who testified against him last Thursday said after the hearing: 'He didn't even look at me while I gave evidence. 'He looked like he didn't care less or he already knows what to expect because he didn't appear at all nervous.'","Francisco Arce Montes was extradited to Spain to be tried for the attack .

"Melvin Gordon, who helped turn the enduring popularity of the humble Tootsie Roll into a candy empire, has died. He was 95. The longtime Tootsie Roll Industries Inc. chairman and CEO died Tuesday in Boston after a brief illness, said Brooke Vane, a spokeswoman for the company's public relations firm. Gordon ran the Chicago-based confectioner for 53 years, overseeing the manufacture of 64 million Tootsie Rolls a day and other sweets including Junior Mints, Charleston Chews and Tootsie Pops. The penny candy patriarch worked a full schedule until last month, the company said. He was the oldest CEO of a company trading on a major U.S. stock exchange, according to S&P Capital IQ. Melvin Gordon, CEO of Tootsie Roll Industries, and his wife, Ellen, pose for a photo at the Candy Expo at Chicago's McCormick Place . Gordon celebrated the Tootsie Roll's 100th anniversary in 1996 by touring the Chicago factory with an Associated Press reporter. He scooped up one of the warm, gooey candies from the assembly line and tasted it, saying: 'There's nothing like a hot Tootsie Roll.' He boasted that Tootsie Rolls were almost indestructible. 'Nothing can happen to a Tootsie Roll. We have some that were made in 1938 that we still eat,' Gordon told the AP in 1996. 'If you can't bite it when it's that old, you certainly can lick it.' Tootsie Rolls were invented in 1896 by New York City candy maker Leo Hirshfield, who named it for his 5-year-old daughter, Clara, his little Tootsie. Tootsie Roll candies making their way down a conveyor belt at a Tootsie Roll Industries plant in Chicago . Gordon seen attending an event with University of Chicago faculty leaders at a hotel in Chicago. He ran the company for 53 years . Tootsie Pops, which are lollipops with Tootsie Roll centers, have been around for more than 80 years. A 1970 TV commercial posed the question: 'How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?' The company says on its website that it's received 20,000 letters from children claiming to have solved the mystery, and the gimmick has migrated to social media, where a bespectacled character named Mr. Owl tweets the question. Tootsie Roll has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1922. Gordon, a Boston native, married into the business in 1950 when he wed Ellen Rubin, whose father, William Rubin, was president of Sweets Co. Of America. Gordon changed the company's name to Tootsie Roll in 1966. Gordon's wife of 65 years, Ellen Gordon, has been named chairman and CEO by its board, the company said Wednesday. She had been serving as company president and chief operating officer. 'Melvin's life represented the very highest values in business, wisdom, generosity, and integrity. Tootsie Roll has seen great growth and success during his time as Chairman,' Ellen Gordon said in a statement.","Melvin Gordon oversaw the manufacture of 64million Tootsie Rolls a day .

"People trying to get a job should not have to hide their accents, the employment minister has said. Liverpudlian Esther McVey warned that for too long jobhunters have felt they must 'neutralise or lose' their accent to persuade companies to take them on. She said Scousers, Brummies and others with strong local dialects should be proud of where they come from to help stamp out 'regional accent discrimination'. Liverpudlian Esther McVey warned that for too long jobhunters have felt they must 'neutralise or lose' their accent to persuade companies to take them on . Miss Mcvey said businesses who reject people with strong accents would be missing out on some of the best talent in the world, pointing to the likes of politician William Hague, magician Dynamo and physicist Brian Cox as people who have not changed the way they speak. She said it was the 'elephant in the room' that some people try to adopt neutral tones at the workplace as they believe it will help them get a job – or a promotion. She told Buzzfeed: 'For too long people have had to neutralise or lose their accent out of fear of prejudicial treatment or to fit in. 'This has then led to a lack of regional accents which has allowed this lazy stereotyping and prejudicial attitudes to prevail. 'It's often the elephant in the room that we still just don't address - but I think it's a debate that needs to be had. 'People shouldn't have to lose their accents to get a fair crack at the whip at a job or move up within a sector or industry. Just think of the fantastic people you would be ruling out of your workforce.' Miss McVey, 48, is a former GMTV presenter who then set up her own business. She has had a rapid rise up the ranks of the government since she was elected MP for Wirral West in 2010. The minister, who is responsible for reducing youth unemployment, said if people were proud of their regional accents, it would help to eliminate prejudice. Miss Mcvey said  magician Dynamo, from Bradford, and physicist Brian Cox, from Oldham, had shown how they could be a success with a strong regional accent . She claimed that her own Liverpool accent had caused people to 'make judgements' about her in the past. She said job applicants should try to overcome this by speaking well. 'You've got to make sure you have good diction, you've got to make sure you're clear, that you're speaking good English', she said. 'The more people don't lose their accents, the more commonplace it will be to hear accents across a range of careers in, for example, universities, the legal profession or in broadcasting', she said. 'That way we'd see regional accent discrimination become a thing of the past. Accents shouldn't be a stick which is used to beat people with – anyone from any walk of life can achieve whatever they want, regardless of what accent they have. Be proud of your accent – it says a lot about you and your heritage. 'Just think of the fantastic people you would be ruling out of your workforce. 'Everyone now wants to study physics and that's because of a brilliant guy from Oldham, Brian Cox. Dynamo is the world's best magician, you'd be ruling him out. 'And if you're looking at great politicians, William Hague is probably the most famous Yorkshireman. 'You look at Harold Wilson, look at James Callaghan, look at Lord Sugar. It brings with it character. In this day and age you can't be regionalist or anti-region.' In 2012, a poll of business leaders found strong regional and 'working class' accents did hold people back in their careers – the 'worst' accent for getting a top job being the Essex accent, with Liverpool and Birmingham also mentioned. But the business leaders also said they would have second thoughts about hiring someone with a very 'posh' accent such as man who spoke like Prince Charles.","Jobhunters have felt they must 'neutralise or lose' accent, says minister .

"If you have stared into your cup of black coffee to wonder why there is often a misty white layer just below its surface that ripples and breaks apart, you are not alone. Physicists have investigated the membrane, which was first identified by scientists in the 1920s, to find that it’s made up of tiny water droplets that float beneath the liquid’s surface and form a triangular lattice, which creates the ‘mist’. Measuring just 20 micrometres across, the droplets fall from above the water surface like rain before they are trapped. Physicists have investigated the strange 'misty' white layer just below the surface of a cup of coffee (illustrated with a stock picture) to find that it’s made up of tiny water droplets that float beneath the liquid’s surface and form a triangular lattice, which creates the ‘mist’ Researchers at Kyoto University and Kyushu University in Japan carried out the first modern study in to the strange phenomenon, Physics arXiv Blog reported. ‘Very few people appear to have imagined such fascinating phenomena happening in a teacup,’ they said. Using a camera placed underneath a water bath, they discovered that the ‘mist’ can be seen on tea and any hot water over 50°C (122°F) - it’s just not as visible as it is in black coffee. Measuring just 20 micrometres across, the droplets fall from above the water surface like rain before they are trapped. Above are microscope images of the hot water surface at different temperatures . Filming the process, they discovered that the droplets fall from above and that occasionally droplets in a certain part of a cup - or water bath - vanish, causing the misty membrane to break apart. The researchers used a camera capable of 8,000 frames a second to film the action to show that the cracks appear at a speed of one metre per second and are accompanied by a wave moving across the surface of the coffee, just below the membrane. Using a camera placed underneath a water bath (shown), they discovered that the ‘mist’ can be seen on hot water over 50°C as well as tea and coffee . While they may have solved some questions about the strange mist, they are not certain on some of the details. Takahiro Umeki and his team believe that droplets may be charged, allowing them to form a triangular lattice in areas of the cup that are packed with the minuscule bubbles. But they are not sure whether an electrostatic force causes them to levitate. They think that the droplets could be levitated by a flow of evaporating particles from the water’s surface, but this is just a guess. They did however, find that the membrane cracks at the same speed as the tiny waves below the surface of the water, suggesting that the droplets are being swamped by a wave as it ripples along. The physicists have calculated that such a wave would need to be be high enough to catch a small population of droplets, causing some of them to burst and the surface of the membrane to break apart. They even say that cracks may occur because of a single water droplet triggering a wave that spreads. Whether there is a membrane on your coffee or not, a study released in Novemeber claimed that the drink could protect against dementia. Drinking between three and five cups a day could cut the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease by up to 20 per cent, scientists said. Nutrition can play an important role in preserving memory and thinking skills, especially during the phase of Alzheimer's disease before symptoms of dementia occur. This is according to a report published by the Institute for Scientific Information on Coffee, who are funded by major European coffee companies such as Illycaffè, Nestlé and DE Master Blenders. Research suggests that compounds called polyphenols are responsible for this protective effect; compounds also found in high quantities in coffee. Other studies cited in the report found regular, life-long moderate coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. But experts from leading charities Alzheimer's Research UK and Alzheimer's society warned the research does not conclusively prove drinking coffee can prevent Alzheimer's, because no clinical trials have been carried out.","Japanese researchers carried out the first modern study in to the strange 'misty' phenomenon that was first identified by scientists in the 1920s .

"A shocked mother was confronted by this pair of black beady eyes after she opened a can of tuna. Zoe Butler made the grim discovery of the mystery purple sea creature as she prepared to tuck into Princes fish chunks. 'I opened the top of the lid and saw a purple thing, a gut sack or intestine - then I turned it round and pushed it with a fork and saw it looking back at me,' said the 28-year-old. 'It's got like a spiny tail along the bottom - it's quite grim. I dropped the fork, jumped back, screamed a bit and shouted for my nan to come and have a look.' Tin monster: This is the mystery sea creature that Zoe Butler found in the can of Princes tuna . The shocked mother-of-two screamed and shouted after making the grim discovery . The mother-of-two had bought the tinned fish, preserved in spring water, as part of a multi-pack from Asda in Arnold, Nottingham. The clerical officer, sent a photo of the fishy find to Princes who have apologised and launched an investigation. 'I haven't shown it to the kids because they might get put off eating tuna. I just want to find out what it is and to make sure it doesn't happen to somebody else,' said Ms Butler. 'I didn't set out to get compensation and I don't a want lifetime's supply of tuna' Her grandmother Susan Goddard, 69, said: 'It's a little red and has eyes, bright black, looking at you. We did manage to ascertain that it was dead.' Dr Hany Elsheikha, associate professor of veterinary parasitology at the University of Nottingham, said it could be some form of juvenile crab. He said: 'All I can see from the picture is a body and the eyes are very prominent. The legs have been chopped off during the process.' A spokesman for Princes said: 'We were contacted by Mrs Butler and immediately responded to apologise. We are arranging for her to send us the product so that we can look into this matter fully.' An Asda spokeswoman said they were awaiting the outcome of the investigation.

"A Harvard law professor named with Prince Andrew in a 'sex slave' case today insisted that he never saw anything improper at the home of their billionaire pedophile friend, Jeffrey Epstein. Alan Dershowitz's claims on Thursday came just one day after accuser Virginia Roberts said in new court filings that the lawyer would chat with Epstein as she performed a sex act on the billionaire. Speaking in an emphatic interview on the Today show , Dershowitz again accused Roberts of 'making the whole thing up' and said her lawyers are putting 'real' rape victims 'in a terrible position'. 'I was never in the presence of a single underage woman,' he said. 'I never saw [Epstein] doing anything improper. I was not a witness. I was not a participant. And I will prove it.' Scroll down for video . Lashing out: Lawyer Alan Dershowitz appeared on the Today show on Thursday to slam claims that he had sex with an underage girl who was supplied to him by billionaire pedophile Prince Andrew . Dershowitz was named last month in court documents by Roberts, who claims she was forced to have sex with friends of Epstein, including the Duke of York, when she was just 17. On Wednesday, she lodged fresh documents in Florida detailing the alleged abuse she suffered at the duke's hands, including how she had an orgy with him and eight other young girls. But on Thursday, Dershowitz said that, while Roberts claims she had sex with him at Epstein's Caribbean Island and his New Mexico ranch, he had only ever been there briefly with his wife and daughter. He claims that the third accusation - that he had sex with Roberts on a private plane - is false and that flight manifests will prove he was never aboard the plane with her. 'I've ever seen her and I've never met her,' he insisted. 'She is categorically lying and making the whole thing up... This is Pinocchio's nose growing longer and longer.' He insisted that his relationship with Epstein had been entirely 'academic' and that he had only ever met with him in the presence of dignitaries and professors. He added that, despite her lawyers' claims, he has agreed to be deposed so that he can speak about the allegations. Together: Dershowitz said any legal success he has against the woman, Virginia Roberts (pictured with Prince Andrew), will work in the royal's favour as it will discredit his accuser . Young: Virginia Roberts says she was just 17 when she was forced to have sex with Epstein's friends . 'Of course I will be deposed, he said. 'I have been absolutely upfront. The lawyers are lying through their teeth when they say I have refused to be deposed.' 'I'm happy to have this out in a court of law... I'm afraid of nothing, I'm hiding nothing. She is afraid of repeating this in public.' Speaking of Roberts' lawyers, he went on: 'They have put rape victims in a terrible position... because when I unequivocally prove that they sat down and made this all up, tragically it will hurt real rape victims, and it shouldn't because you shouldn't generalize.' Dershowitz has previously urged the Duke of York to fight back against claims the woman made that she was forced to have sex with the royal while she was a minor in the state of Florida. Prince Andrew is expected to comment about the accusations later on Thursday, in what would be an unprecedented move for a royal. The palace previously issued a vehement denial on Prince Andrew's behalf. 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts,' a spokesperson said. 'The allegations made are false and without any foundation.' Roberts called the denial 'false and hurtful to me'. Following her most recent filing, a Buckingham Palace spokesman added this week: 'We have nothing to say in addition to our earlier comments on the issue.' Old friends: Prince Andrew came under fire after he was pictured with Epstein following his prison term in 2011 . Roberts claims she had sex with the Prince, a former friend of Epstein, in New York, London and the U.S.Virgin Islands while she was a 'sex slave'. Buckingham Palace has denied all allegations. In the documents, she said her lawyers had served a letter on the Duke last week requesting he answer questions – but he 'refused' to accept it. She also described the alleged abuse in new and startling detail. She claimed Prince Andrew correctly guessed she was just 17 when he met her, and how she was instructed to give him anything he wanted. His police bodyguards left her alone with him the first time they had sex, she said. 'Epstein made me have sex with Prince Andrew several times,' she said. 'I had sex with him three times, including one orgy. I knew he was a member of the British Royal Family, but I just called him 'Andy.' After they had sex, she was paid $15,000, she said. Prince Andrew's decision to pursue legal action - he has the right to sue his accuser - will depend on whether the Palace is willing to subject him to depositions about his private life. Anger: Dershowitz slammed his accuser's lawyers, Brad Edwards (left) and Paul Cassell (right), for naming him in the lawsuit. He claims that they failed to carry out proper investigations - which they have denied . But Dershowitz said his extensive legal action would be beneficial to Prince Andrew as it would serve to discredit his accuser. Earlier this month, he filed a sworn statement in Florida and defamation suits in both London and the U.S. based on Roberts' lawyers' public statements about the case. He has also challenged them to sign sworn statements repeating their charges. Dershowitz has also filed a motion in federal court to enter in a lawsuit brought against the U.S. government by his accuser and other women who say Epstein sexually abused them. The court has yet to decide whether to grant his motion. The two lawyers representing Jane Doe #3, former federal judge Paul Cassell and Florida plaintiffs attorney Bradley Edwards, have now filed counter-defamation charges against Dershowitz. In an earlier article, he explained that this will subject them and their client to sworn depositions. If they repeat the charges under oath, and if they are untrue, they will be subject to prosecution for perjury. Support: Dershowitz's wife Carolyn (pictured with their daughter), has spoken out in support of her husband . In a previous statement to DailyMail.com, Mr Cassell said that he and Mr Edwards would not be responding to 'specific claims of indignation by anyone'. 'We have been informed of Mr Dershowitz's threats based on the factual allegations we have made in our recent filing,' he said in a statement. 'We carefully investigate all of the allegations in our pleadings before presenting them... We would be pleased to consider any sworn testimony and documentary evidence Mr Dershowitz would like to provide which he contends would refute any of our allegations.' Finally, Dershowitz has also challenged his accuser to file formal rape charges against him. If she were to file a false rape charge, she would be committing a crime. She has not done so. It comes a week after Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson slammed reports that he had sex with an underage girl as 'salacious lies' and defended him as a 'humongously good man'. In a passionate rebuttal on the Today show last Tuesday, the Duchess of York said that she was standing by 'my best friend and my best ex-husband ever' amid the allegations.

"A police force attempting to highlight the kind of reports they get in a 12 hour period by live-tweeting each 999 call received their first incident from someone who had forgotten where they had parked. Officers from the Metropolitan Police covering the east London borough of Havering have been posting the calls they received today on Twitter using the hashtag #MPSHaveringLive.

The force tweeted: 'Call 1: Caller wishes to cancel report made re. stolen motor vehicle. 'Vehicle was parked in a different street.' Officers later added that the call was made via the non-emergency 101 number and the incident was closed without police attending. As the day went on other incidents included a report of a theft from a van overnight but 'nothing was taken' and reports of a panic alarm going off in a shop, but it turned out to be an error.

Another call was from about a panic alarm being set off in a shop in Hornchurch, but it turned out be a false alarm. Police have been using the hash tag #MPSHaveringLive on Twitter today . More serious calls were taken such as one caller who had been contacted by a company claiming to be a PPI firm and needed a £5,000 admin fee. A pensioner also received a call from a 'bogus police officer, asking for credit card details'. Meanwhile, officers on foot stopped a male in possession of cannabis around 7pm, who was taken into custody, and dealt with a road rage incident during the evening rush hour in Hornchurch. Havering Police, which began tweeting at 9am and rounded off at 9pm, said: 'The idea is to give the public a glimpse of what we deal with on a daily basis.' The force did take some more serious calls including one from a caller who needed assistance from police to attend an ex-partner's house with them to collect property . Police were asked to help after a member of the public raised concerns about a man laying on the floor . Twitter users have been getting in touch with the force with their feedback on the initiative, saying they have found it 'surprising', 'good' and 'interesting'. Greater Manchester Police trialled the scheme in 2010 after the chief constable - Sir Peter Fahy - decided to give a 'day-in-the-life' account of what goes on in the force and show how overstretched they are.

"Kid Rock has sparked the anger of animal rights activists after he was pictured posing with a dead mountain lion. The singer is seen in a image standing alongside right-wing rock singer Ted Nugent, holding the animal's body in the snow. The picture was uploaded to the Facebook page of Nugent, who defended hunting as legal and necessary in the caption. Ted Nugent posted the picture of himself and Kid Rock holding up the dead lion to his Facebook page, but it has sparked anger from animal rights activists . He wrote: 'HAIL my MotorCity boy KidRock for saving all those muledeer elk & livestock by whacking this magnificent mountain lion. 'I can hear the braindead squawkers already with their obscene denial that killing lion is wrong. Its legal its necessary its good its beneficial its a damn riot!' It is unclear how the cat was killed but hunting mountain lions is not illegal due to the Animal Control Damage Act with allows them to be killed if they pose threats to agriculture or livestock. However, many people have hit out at the pair for posing with the dead animal. International media director at PETA Ben Williamson told the Huffington Post: 'It's obvious that not everybody has evolved mentally and emotionally when you see someone grinning after gunning down another living being who was busy minding his or her own business and living life. 'These days, only the very smallest percentage of people find it acceptable in any way to support blood sports like trophy hunting.' Kid Rock has also blasted critics of the film American Sniper, which tells the story of U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle . In addition one fan wrote on Facebook: 'I always thought that Ted Nugent believes in only hunting what he can eat? Nobody eats mountain lions. I get the protecting but that's the circle of life. Mountain lions need to eat to survive too! They don't need to be killed! Not happy with Kid Rock!' The picture comes after earlier this week the 44-year-old blasted critics of the film American Sniper in a blog post. Both actor Seth Rogen and filmmaker Michael Moore appeared to make controversial statements about the film, which profiles Chris Kyle, a U.S. Navy SEAL who was described as the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. CBS Detroit notes that Kid Rock has responded in a post on his site titled 'AMERICAN SNIPER, MICHAEL MOORE AND SETH ROGAN (sic).' Ted Nugent, pictured, is a board member of the National Rifle Association and often posts hunting pictures of dead animals on Facebook . Rock wrote: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon. 'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.' Meanwhile Mr Nugent, who is a board member of the National Rifle Association since 1995, often posts hunting pictures of dead animals on his Facebook account. In 2012, he was fined $10,000 after he illegally shot and killed a bear in May 2009 on Sukkwan Island in Alaska.","Kid Rock posed alongside Ted Nugent and a dead mountain lion .

"A rare phaser gun prop from the original series of Star Trek is tipped to make $60,000 when it goes under the hammer - 50 years after it first appeared on TV screens. The fibreglass prop is one of only two known to exist from the ground-breaking show, which followed the adventures maverick starship captain James T. Kirk and his intrepid crew. Star Trek is now considered one of the greatest television programmes ever made and original props demand a high price among its legions of dedicated fans around the world. Sci-fi history: This fibreglass phaser prop from the original series of sci-fi serial Star Trek is expected to make as much as $60,000 when it goes under the hammer at a specialist prop auction in Los Angeles next month . Experts say the phaser appears in an episode called Assignment: Earth, broadcast on March 29, 1968. They even traced the scene it was used in by matching up scratches and blemishes on the prop. They found it was being held by a security officer in Enterprise's transporter room in the opening sequence of the episode. Assignment: Earth, which followed the crew of the Enterprise on a journey back to Earth for research purposes was the 55th in the original series of Star Trek. The prop has been described as 'an incredible piece of television history' and is tipped to fetch $60,000 when it is auctioned at Propworx near Los Angeles. It belonged to the production company behind Star Trek, Desilu, and was sold off after filming ended in 1969. It has been owned privately ever since. Some wear and tear: Nut the prop has been described as 'an incredible piece of television history' and is tipped to fetch $60,000 when it is auctioned at Propworx near Los Angeles on February 21 . Super rare: The fibreglass prop is one of only two known to exist from the ground-breaking show, which followed the adventures maverick starship captain James T. Kirk, pictured, and his intrepid crew . A spokesman for Propwox said: 'This is an exceptionally rare screen-used fiberglass phaser pistol from Star Trek: The Original Series, and one of only two such examples that is known to have survived from the 60s. 'This incredible piece of television history has been exhaustively researched and precisely screen matched to the mid-grade phaser prop featured in an opening scene in the episode Assignment: Earth where it is seen in a close-up view on-screen in the hand of a security officer in the transporter room. 'It is the presence of both a uniquely contoured scratch line and a small blemish formed by excess paint - both on the front face of the pistol body - as well as perfectly matching orientations of the attached silver nozzle ring and the right-angled metal plate on top that have enabled this particular prop to be positively identified on-screen in that memorable time-travel episode, which originally was broadcast on March 29, 1968. 'Furthermore, it is extremely likely that this historic hand prop, as part of the Desilu inventory, was utilised in the filming of several other episodes during the second and third seasons of the original series in addition to Assignment: Earth. 'While this hand prop features some paint wear, surface scratches and some seam separation and missing knobs and accent pieces that is typical of rare screen used TOS memorabilia. 'It is undeniably a visually exciting, sturdily-constructed and highly presentable piece of Star Trek history - a truly iconic and highly desirable addition to the finest of Star Trek and Hollywood memorabilia collections.' The auction will be held on February 21.","The 50-year-old prop is only of only two known to exist from the series .

"Since coming clean a year ago, Jess has made her story public and become and ambassador for charity Febfast to inspire others to stop taking drugs . When she was only 17-years-old, Jess woke up in a squatters' drug-house to find that she had no memory of the last five months. The teenager from Melbourne's inner west had been smoking ice every day for so long that she had lost complete track of time and believed her mobile phone, which displayed the date, was faulty. 'With ice, your sense of time disappears when you smoke and you think it has been five minutes but it has been five hours. Because I was smoking every day, my sense of time was completely gone,' Jess, now 20-years-old, told Daily Mail Australia. 'I thought it was still May, but when I turned on my phone it said it was October. It sent me into a nervous breakdown - I couldn't believe it, I thought the phone was faulty, then I thought it was lying to me. 'It was a turning point for me because I realised how dominant the ice was; I had no memory of that five month period, it was taking my life away. It sunk in that night that I had to make a change.' Now, three years later, Jess has made her story public and become an ambassador for Febfast, a charity for youths with addictions, in an effort to inspire others to turn their life around. Since joining the group, she's been contacted by dozens of people thanking her for sharing her story, including a grandmother supporting her addicted grandson who told Jess she was moved by her brave recovery. For Jess, the start of her addiction is a story that has been heard before; at 16 she became involved with the wrong crowd at a new high school and found herself experimenting with drugs when things began to escalate. Scroll down for video . Now 20-years-old, the former addict from Melbourne's inner west, started smoking crystal meth at 16 . 'I started by smoking cannabis and progressed from there and got offered to smoke ice,' Jess said. 'I had no knowledge of ice and as soon as I had my first smoke, I was addicted. It was too good not to continue to use.' 'It's crazy how quickly it spirals out of control. Within the first month, I quit my job, stopped going to school and ran away from home.' She remembers one of the biggest turning points in her life as being the day she gave up her safe, clean and loving family home to live in 'one of the biggest drug houses in the suburbs'. 'When I was in high school I'd always be stoned and one day she [Jess' mum] picked me up from school and I was all over the place after smoking ice. She asked me what was wrong and I told her that I was high on ice because you don't have a filter on things when you smoke, you can't keep secrets,' Jess said. Her turning point came when she realised she had no memory of a five month long period in which she had been smoking every day . She gave up her safe, clean and loving family home to live in 'one of the biggest drug houses in the suburbs' where there was no running water or toilet (stock image) 'We realised it had escalated out of control, but I just said that this was going to be something I was doing. 'It's crazy how quickly it spirals out of control. Within the first month, I quit my job, stopped going to school and ran away from home,' Jess said of her first month of smoking ice . 'She cried, she was very upset and she just wished me well but told me I had to leave because she didn't want me doing drugs in her house, so I did. 'It just goes to show how much of a hold ice can have over you: I was willing to trade everything in for a squatting house with no running water or toilet. When you use ice you'll do anything just to have it in your life every day.' While she can't recall how long she spent in the drug-house, Jess recalled that a lot of professionals would visit the property for crystal methamphetamines. 'There were professional workers coming to score with you – it was a place where you bought stuff but you could stay there… everybody knew that house,' she said. Coming clean was not easy for the teenager, who took on a detox program on two separate occasions and fell back into old habits before a third two-year long program by the Youth Support + Advocacy Service finally helped her lead a normal drug-free life and rekindle her relationship with her mother. 'The physical comedown is like nothing you can imagine, which is another reason I was addicted, I was constantly avoiding the comedown so I would constantly smoke,' she said. 'It feels like you've slipped into a massive depression. Physically you were sweating, you can't eat, mentally you're so tired but your body won't let you sleep. Paranoia is a massive side effect; you think everyone is out to get you, your idea of reality is really skewed, you get really angry and aggressive.' 'The physical comedown is like nothing you can imagine,' she said of her detox. 'Physically you were sweating, you can't eat, mentally you're so tired but your body won't let you sleep. Paranoia is a massive side effect; you think everyone is out to get you, your idea of reality is really skewed, you get really angry and aggressive' Despite the pain and the life events she said she has missed out on, Jess said she didn't entirely regret using drugs because of the way the experience has allowed her to help others . Despite the pain and the life events she said she has missed out on – including graduating and attending school formals, Jess said she didn't entirely regret using drugs because of the way the experience has allowed her to help others. 'I hope that by sharing my story, people using ice can feel inspired and take the opportunity to change their life as well. I want to encourage all Australians to raise money for the drug and alcohol services that assisted me because it's not something that you can get through yourself. 'Detox and rehab costs a lot of money and we do need the support to have these services available for other people.'

"The desperate 911 call of a mother cradling a teenage boy stabbed by her daughter's boyfriend has been released. Robynn Davis begged the victim, identified as 17-year-old Lucas Cavanaugh not to die, as she urged police in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, to hurry, saying the alleged attacker was still on the loose. According to the recording, reported by ABC, Ms Davis can be heard saying: 'He's in the house, he's somewhere. He's my daughter's boyfriend.' Scroll down for the audiotape of the 911 call . Lucas Cavanaugh, 17, was stabbed to death on Sunday night. The killer was allegedly the boyfriend of a girl whom the teenager had sent a Snapchat message . Matthew Fischer, 16, has been charged with murder over the fatal stabbing of classmate, 17-year-old Lucas Cavanaugh, on Sunday in Park West, South Carolina . She can be heard on the eight-minute tape reassuring the victim and pleading with him. 'Lucas, baby, please, oh God. Are you alive? Yes, you are. Please, please let's make it. 'He's got a pulse and he is breathing but he's completely unconscious. He has been stabbed right in his stomach,' she added to the 911 dispatcher. An incident report released by police on Tuesday described how an officer responding to the scene found Cavanaugh lying in the middle of the street with a stomach wound and two women sitting near him. The stabbing allegedly took place because a teenage girl's boyfriend was upset about a Snapchat message sent by the victim. Matthew Joseph Fischer, 16, of Mount Pleasant was visiting his girlfriend's home in Park West near Charleston, South Carolina on Sunday when he saw a message from Cavanaugh on her iPod, detectives said. The message was sent through Snapchat, a photo-and-text app on which messages are visible for only a brief time. The message angered Fischer, according to an arrest affidavit. Officials have not released details about the content of the message. 'The defendant took the iPod and contacted the victim. Words were exchanged at which point the defendant told the victim 'Come over 'and 'I'll kill you man,' the affidavit said. A desperate 911 call was released of the teenage girl's mother begging police to hurry as she tried to save the life of Lucas Cavanaugh (pictured) Cavanaugh, of nearby Sullivans Islands, came to the girl's house, and the two fought, authorities said. 'During the altercation, the defendant produced a knife from his right pant pocket and proceeded to stab the victim in the torso, resulting in death,' the affidavit said. One of the women brought the officer a knife and identified it as the weapon, according to the report. The woman said a youth had come to her house with a bloody knife shortly after the incident, dropped the knife and run off. Fischer was later arrested at the scene while sitting in his mother's car, authorities said. He was forced out of the car at gunpoint and taken into custody. Fischer is charged as an adult with murder and possession of a knife. He was denied bond on Monday. He and Cavanaugh attended Wando High School. The teen's friends gathered on a local beach on Wednesday evening to bid farewell to their friend, releasing balloons and lanterns and covering his beloved car in flowers. A celebration of life service is being held on Friday. 'This is just a tragedy for the entire Wando community and the families involved,' Fischer's attorney, Peter David Brown, said at the bond hearing, The Post and Courier reported.

According to WWD.com, the fashion veteran, who founded his eponymous label in 2005, passed away at his home in Greenwich, Connecticut, on Wednesday, surrounded by his wife Louise and his five children. Mrs Camuto, who serves as the creative director of her husband's company, broke the devastating news to the company's 1,300 employees in an email last night, paying tribute to her husband's wonderful spirit and praising his extraordinary work ethic. She promised that his legacy - and his work - will live on for years to come. Scroll down for video .

Mr Camuto has long-been recognized as one of the fashion industry's leading lights when it comes to shoes and accessories, having co-founded popular shoe brand Nine West in 1978, before going on to launch his eponymous fashion house the Camuto Group in 2001, which was followed by his globally-successful label Vince Camuto in 2005. The father-of-five also helped to launch singer Jessica Simpson's multi-million dollar brand in 2005, acting as her mentor throughout much of the last ten years and helping her to achieve phenomenal success with the label. Ms Simpson, 34, posted a heartbreaking tribute to her long-time friend and business partner on Instagram last night, shortly after learning about his death. Alongside a picture of herself posing with Mr Camuto and his wife Louise, she shared an inspirational quote from the designer, commenting: '""It is never about one person. It’s the teams you put in place. Without the right people, you’re nowhere” - Vince Camuto' She then added a touching message of her own, saying: 'Thank you, Vince, for the humble power that has taken me everywhere.

"Scientists are closer to finding a galactic 'skeleton' that they believe could be lurking inside the fabric of our galaxy. Discovering these 'bones' could help researchers get a better picture of the Milky Way looks like from the outside. A US team has already discovered one of the galactic bone while studying a dust cloud nicknamed 'Nessie'. Scientists are closer to finding a galactic 'skeleton' that they believe could be lurking inside the fabric of our galaxy. In this image, the dashed line represents the location of the physical galactic mid-plane. The colour circles inside the green box are sources belonging to one of the identified 'bones' Nessie was identified in 2013 by the light it absorbed. Radio emissions from molecular gas show that Nessie not a chance projection of material on the sky, but instead a real feature. Not only is 'Nessie' in the galactic plane, but also it extends much longer than anyone anticipated. This slender bone of the Milky Way is more than 300 light-years long but only one or two light-years wide. It contains about 100,000 suns' worth of material, and looks more like a cosmic snake. A study presented at the 225th meeting of the American Astronomical Society shows that Nessie is not alone. Nessie was identified by the light it absorbed.

Our Milky Way is a spiral galaxy - a pinwheel-shaped collection of stars, gas and dust.  It has a central bar and two major spiral arms that wrap around its disk (artist's impression pictured) Catherine Zucker, an undergraduate physics student at the University of Virginia, claims to have found six candidates for galactic bones in a new study. 'It's a really new field of study,' Ms Zucker told Space.com at the AAS meeting in Seattle. Our Milky Way is a spiral galaxy - a pinwheel-shaped collection of stars, gas and dust. It has a central bar and two major spiral arms that wrap around its disk. Astronomers have identified a new structure in the Milky Way: a long tendril of dust and gas that they are calling a 'bone.' Observations, especially at infrared wavelengths of light, have found long skinny features jutting between galaxies' spiral arms. These relatively straight structures are much less massive than the curving spiral arms. Discovering these 'bones' could help researchers get a better picture of the Milky Way looks like from the outside. 'What I was trying to do was basically prove that the Nessie filament wasn't some curiosity, wasn't a fluke - that there are other filaments out there similar to Nessie that can trace galactic structure.' Other spiral galaxies also display internal bones or endoskeletons. Observations, especially at infrared wavelengths of light, have found long skinny features jutting between galaxies' spiral arms. Ms Zucker explained that there are some initial criteria for a galactic bone. For instance, they must lie mostly parallel to the plane of the galaxy. They should also to trace the spine of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm, one of the largest arms in the Milky Way. And a bone must also be more than 50 times longer than it is wide. Ms Zucker's team are currently analysing something dubbed 'Filament 5,' which lies in the Scutum-Centaurus Arm, but on the opposite side of the galaxy Nessie. Astronomers know that the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy - a pinwheel-shaped collection of stars, gas and dust. It has a central bar and two major spiral arms that wrap around its disk.

"Lord Brittan was accused of failing to act on a dossier of explosive paedophile allegations handed to him as Home Secretary . Lord Brittan's sudden death is a blow to victims of child abuse who were waiting to question him over his role investigating child abuse allegations in the 1980s, a campaigning MP has claimed. Labour's Simon Danczuk said the Conservative peer's death was a 'sad day for his family' but also for the Government's inquiry into historic allegations of child abuse which has been beset by problems after being set up by Theresa May last year. Two chairmen chosen by the Home Secretary were forced to step down after their personal connection to Lord Brittan emerged. Child abuse survivors had accused Lord Brittan of failing to act on a dossier of explosive paedophile allegations handed to him as Home Secretary in the 1980s – an allegation he strenuously denied. Speaking this afternoon after the Lord Brittan's death was confirmed, Mr Danczuk said: 'Not only is it a sad day for Leon Brittan's family, it's also a sad day for the survivors of child sex abuse, because they would have wanted to hear from Leon Brittan at this inquiry in terms of what he knew about the allegations that were made in the 1980s.' Mrs May set up the inquiry into historic child abuse in July to find out whether public bodies had neglected or covered up allegations in the wake of claims paedophiles had operated in Westminster in the 1980s. She announced today that a new chair would be appointed by the end of the month following a series of problems, including the resignation of two previous chairs over their alleged links to Establishment figures of the time. The Home Secretary will also decide whether it will take the form of a statutory inquiry or a royal commission by the end of January, with both options having the power to compel witnesses and full access to evidence. Mrs May said: 'I am clear that the new chairman must be someone who commands that confidence and who has the necessary skills and experience to carry out this vital work. 'In my work to find that person, as I told the House I would do, I have undertaken a number of meetings with the survivors of child abuse and their representative bodies And I have been deeply moved by the candour and the courage they have shown in telling me their harrowing stories and the experiences they have been through.' The Home Secretary will decide whether the inquiry will take the form of a statutory inquiry or a royal commission by the end of Januar . Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called for the inquiry to be scrapped and relaunched with a new chair and statutory powers . Mrs May added: 'I am absolutely committed to finding them the right chairman to ensure they get the answers they deserve. 'But not only does this inquiry need the right Chairman, it also needs the right powers. 'That means the ability to compel witnesses, and full access to all the necessary evidence. 'In December I wrote to panel members to set out the three options which could give the inquiry these powers. 'I confirmed those options in my evidence that month to the Home Affairs Select Committee, and I also confirmed that I would make my decision on the right model for the inquiry and the chairman by the end of January. 'It remains my intention to make a statement to the House shortly after I have made that decision and after the necessary interviews and careful due diligence work have taken place.' Ms Cooper called for the inquiry to be scrapped and relaunched with a new chair and statutory powers. The Labour frontbencher said: 'Since November the allegations have become more serious. Labour's Simon Danczuk said the Conservative peer's death was a 'sad day for his family' but also for the Government's inquiry into historic allegations of child abuse . 'The police are now investigating allegations of child murder involving senior figures linked to Dolphin Square. 'A government file has emerged containing further potential allegations of abuse, clearly not seen by the Wanless review. 'These need to be investigated by the police, not just an inquiry, but it makes it even more vital that a serious and credible inquiry is under way with the confidence of the public and survivors. 'Given the seriousness of this, I now fear there is no choice but to start this inquiry again properly with a new chair and statutory powers and proper consideration of the scope and purpose involving the survivors themselves. 'This should not be beyond the wit of the Home Secretary.' Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Mrs May was 'in danger of losing control of the process' and raised concerns about the allegation of bullying of a panel member by the inquiry's barrister. Mrs May said survivor Sharon Evans's complaint had been investigated and no evidence of bullying found by Ben Emmerson QC. The Home Secretary, meanwhile, revealed that allegations of 'unnatural sexual' behaviour at Westminster contained in a file found at the National Archives may have already been seen by the inquiry into the Home Office's handling of historic sex abuse claims. Mrs May said the previously top-secret file may be a duplicate of one that was already looked at by NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless and barrister Richard Whittam QC's inquiry into paedophile ring allegations in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. University lecturer Dr Chris Murphy uncovered the once-classified document late last year at the archives in Kew, south west London. After being questioned on the file, which was marked to indicate it had passed through former prime minister Margaret Thatcher's office, Mrs May told the Commons: 'You have made reference to the file that has come to light. 'We are checking that but as I understand it we believe it may be a duplicate of a file that was at the Home Office which was seen by Wanless and Whittam during their review but of course we are checking that. 'Any allegations in relation to that file will be passed to the police and those concerned to ensure that they are looked at properly.' The file which came to light was found by Dr Murphy in November. It was entitled: 'PREM19/588 - SECURITY. Allegations against former public (word missing) of unnatural sexual proclivities; security aspects 1980 Oct 27 - 1981 Mar 20.'","Labour MP said  peer's death a blow for inquiry into historic child abuse .

"Ashton Kutcher is preparing to take to the witness stand to testify against the man charged with the grisly murder of the actor's then-girlfriend. Michael Thomas Gargiulo stands accused of murdering three women, including Ashton's then-girlfriend, 22-year-old Ashley Ellerin, on February 21, 2001. And ahead of the trial new court documents have revealed the full horror of the killings. Ashley, who lived just 400ft away from Gargiulo in Los Angeles, was attacked while she was showering and stabbed 47 times. Set to testify: Ashton Kutcher, right, pictured with wife Mila Kunis in December last year, will soon appear in court to give evidence about the killing of his then-girlfriend Ashley Ellerin in 2001 . Killed: Ashley Ellerin, 22, was a student at the Los Angeles Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising who had been on dates with and was speaking to Kutcher - who was 23 at the time - the night she was murdered . Happier times: Ashley Ellerin (center) was stabbed 47 times in the shower of her LA apartment . New court documents published in the Radar Online claim: 'He slashed Ms. Ellerin’s throat so violently [he] nearly decapitated her. 'After she was murdered her body was left displayed in a… demeaning pose that was sexual in nature.' The next victim air conditioning repairman Gargiulo is charged with killing is Maria Bruno, whose home was less than 100ft from Gargiulo’s in Monterey Park, California when she was killed on December 1 2005. 'Gargiulo quite literally butchered her body – stabbing her multiple times, slitting her throat, slicing off her breasts, and staging her for family members and police to find,' state court documents filed by the prosecution. Alleged victims: Ashley Ellerin, left, Ashton Kutcher's then-girlfriend, was killed in her home in 2001, while Tricia Pacaccio, right, was stabbed in Chicago in 1993 . 'Butchered': Maria Bruno was killed on December 1 2005 at her home in Monterey Park, California . The prosecutors call Garigulo 'a serial, psycho-sexual thrill killer who engages in the systematic slaughter of beautiful women because he takes sexual pleasure from manipulating, stabbing and killing his victims.' Gargiulo, now 37, was arrested in 2008 after DNA evidence was recovered from the Santa Monica apartment of Michelle Murphy, who survived an alleged knife attack in April of that year. He stands accused of her attempted murder. He is also accused of the 1993 killing of high school classmate Tricia Pacaccio in the Chicago suburb of Glenview, where Gargiulo lived at the time. Kutcher is due in court to testify in the trial of Gargiulo within the next few months, the report claims. The 36-year-old actor has rarely spoken about the death of Ellerin - but his written testimony to police reveals shocking details of what he saw on the night of the murder. On February 21 in 2001, Kutcher had received a call from Ellerin. The student, aspiring model and part-time Las Vegas stripper had tried to make a date with the then 23-year-old actor - but Kutcher had fatefully turned down the offer. Standing trial: Michael Thomas Gargiulo stands accused of the grisly murders of three women, and the attempted murder of a fourth . Instead Ellerin and her father spent the day doing some remodeling and painting at her apartment. After dropping off her father at the airport she called her landlord, Mark Durbin, asking if he could fix her ceiling fan and move some furniture. Ellerin and Durbin, who had bit parts on Frasier and Six Feet Under, then made love. Durbin testified in June last year that he and Ellerin were involved in a 'blossoming' relationship. Ellerin was said to be playing the field, having recently broken up with her boyfriend, an acting coach. LAPD Detective Tom Small told LA Weekly: ‘She had tons of boyfriends. At that time Kutcher was still coming up. 'He hadn't established his big-time credentials yet. They met through a mutual friend. It was a friendly thing. They went out a couple of times.’ Ellerin had also dated Pitch Black star Vin Diesel and Law And Order's Jeremy Sisto, who reportedly flew her to a set in Toronto, where he was filming 2001's Angel Eyes. It was a few minutes after Durbin left, that Ellerin called Kutcher to ask him if she should go with him to his friends to watch the Grammys. He turned her down but said instead he would later visit her at her Hollywood bungalow - just behind the famous Grauman's Chinese Theatre. Kutcher later told police that he tried to call Ellerin twice during the evening but she did not pick up her phone. Kutcher drove to her apartment at 10.45pm in the hope of smoothing over what he thought was a looming argument, and found that the lights were on in her apartment and her car was parked outside. After knocking on the door and calling out to her with no answer, Kutcher said he looked through a window into the apartment and saw what he thought was red wine pooled on the floor.

"Dance teacher Nadia Wearn died hours after she was sent home from hospital after doctors failed to carry out the correct tests . A distressed mother died just hours after being sent home from A&E by a doctor who said her crippling pain was caused by holding her young daughter the wrong way. The junior doctor prescribed Nadia Wearn painkillers, telling her that she was suffering from bad posture and a trapped nerve, possibly caused by holding her baby incorrectly. But just over two hours after returning home the 31-year-old dance teacher collapsed and died from a heart attack in front of her family. Her daughter Ava, who was just 13 weeks old when her mother died, has now been awarded damages after the hospital admitted liability. Bosses said Mrs Wearn could have been saved if she had been tested more thoroughly. The case comes two days after it emerged that a new blood test would help doctors spot ‘hidden’ heart attacks in women. Mrs Wearn had complained of breathlessness and pains across her chest, abdomen and left arm when she visited South Tyneside Hospital in 2011. However, doctors failed to perform tests such as an ECG, which measures the heart’s electrical activity, and blood analysis. Both are commonly used to determine whether a patient is suffering cardio problems but diagnosis rates at A&E are significantly lower for women. Soon after returning to her home in South Shields, Mrs Wearn collapsed as she sat next to her mother, Pauline Elleithy. Miss Elleithy, who had 40 years’ nursing experience, desperately tried to revive her daughter but Mrs Wearn lost consciousness. She was taken to hospital and pronounced dead an hour later. After the tragedy, Miss Elleithy said her daughter had complained about doctors dismissing her problems because of how she was holding Ava. A court later found that the mother-of-one's life could have been saved if the correct tests were carried out . Mrs Wearn’s husband Jason, 38, and Ava, now three, were awarded undisclosed damages at the High Court this week. South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust admitted liability and apologised for the failings. From Wednesday's Mail . After the hearing, the family’s solicitor Angela Curran said the trust agreed further tests should have been carried out. ‘Had those tests been undertaken, Nadia would still have been in hospital at the time of her cardiac arrest and in all likelihood would have been resuscitated,’ she said. The damages will now be paid into the court and administered for Ava’s benefit. Mrs Wearn, who worked as a dance teacher at independent Newcastle High School for Girls, suffered from a hereditary blood condition as a child. She went through several blood transfusions and surgery to remove her spleen at the age of eight. But she overcame her health problems to enjoy an active adult life. Dr Alan Rodgers, a medical director at South Tyneside District Hospital, said the hospital should have carried out more tests given the symptoms Mrs Wearn displayed. ‘In what Nadia presented, we were duty-bound to do more tests,’ he said. A spokesman for the trust in charge of South Tyneside hospital said: 'We are extremely sorry about Nadia Wearn's tragic death' Dr Soni Shrestha, who examined Mrs Wearn, told an inquest in 2012 that the findings from initial tests on the mother were ‘normal’. She said: ‘There was no indication for blood tests so I did not feel I had to do the blood tests. She did not appear anxious. All her vitals were fine.’ On Tuesday, it was revealed that a new £20 test that looks at levels of a protein produced by damaged heart cells could double the chances of spotting hidden heart attacks in women. Existing checks are good at picking up cardiac trouble in men suffering chest pains, with a diagnosis rate of 19 per cent. However the rate for women is only 11 per cent.","New mother went to hospital complaining of chest and back pain .

"Parents are increasingly using access to computers as a way of controlling youngsters’ behaviour, researchers have found. The Childwise survey, which has been tracking family life in the UK since the 1990s, shows a huge increase in the number of tablet computers used by children. It shows that young people now spend even more time online than they spend watching television. In its 21st annual survey, Childwise also found the use of tablet computers is overtaking laptops among young children. Parents are increasingly using access to computers as a way of controlling their children's behaviour, with limits on tablets and the internet acting as as a punishment or reward (file photo) And it suggests iPads, Kindles and smartphones have become important bargaining chips in family negotiations. The researchers said: ‘Parents like tablets because they are controllable - a tablet can be given or taken away to reflect good or bad behaviour, in a way that is not possible with a conventional television set or computer. ‘Apps can be purchased as rewards, and, with the growing use of tablets in primary schools, there are strong perceived educational advantages.’ However, research director Simon Leggett said tablet computers are particularly likely to be seen as the young person's personal possession, making the arguments about restrictions even more difficult. The internet is now so much a part of young people's lives that they see access as a fundamental right rather than a privilege (file photo) He said that access to the internet is now so much a part of young people's lives that they see access as a fundamental right rather than a privilege. Cathy Ranson, editor of the Netmums parenting website, said the survey showed banning screen time was ‘the modern version of grounding’. She told BBC News that Netmums users had found many parents using limits on computers as a punishment or reward, replacing ‘traditional treats’. But she warned that too much emphasis on access to screen time could prioritise computers ‘to the exclusion of real family life’. The Childwise annual survey, based on a representative sample of more than 2,000 children across the UK, aged 5 to 16, shows that two of the most popular destinations are YouTube and the online game Minecraft. They spend on average more time each night online than they spend in the entire week on sports activities outside school. The study shows that among the youngest group, five to seven year olds, one in three have their own tablet computer, with two in five going online every day for an average of more than an hour. Among older children, in the 13 to 16 year old group, internet use is even more widespread, averaging two and a half hours a day, with YouTube the most widely used website. Smartphones are owned by nine of out of 10 of these teenagers, who use them for accessing the internet and using services like Snapchat with their friends.","Parents using tablets as bargaining chips to control children's behaviour .

"Researchers found that those in weight loss groups sought support during the beginning of the regimes . We all feel good when we shed a few pounds – but a little known side-effect is that we can lose friends at the same time. A study of weight loss groups found members are very supportive of each other at the start. However, as they become thinner they get more competitive and chilly towards their fellow slimmers, according to research yesterday. Instead of passing each other dieting tips and meal plans, they begin to keep their secrets to themselves at the weekly weigh ins and group discussions, it added. Researchers from universities including Stanford and Texas in the States and Peking University in China, looked at how members of a Weight Watchers group behaved. In the early stages new members would turn up feeling fat and with a lack of confidence about how they would progress so they sought support from others in the group. This leads to groups becoming mutually supportive, cheering each other on when they drop a pound or two on the scales and sharing ideas and tips about weight loss regimes. But as an individual gets closer to the target they had originally been set, they gain in confidence and become more competitive. They no longer feel they need the support of others as much as they used to, said the study for the Journal of Consumer Research, and so become distant and reclusive. As a result, they even become secretive and selfish, keeping any new weight loss advice or strategies to themselves and not passing them on. But this could become a problem as many people with an addiction, not just regarding weight, often give up if they do not get the support of others in a similar situation. The bonding and friendship that helped the overweight members at the beginning slowly dissolves as individuals begin to see the pounds drop off, said the report. The authors wrote: 'When consumers start working toward a goal, they often feel uncertain about how to achieve the goal and see others at a similar stage as friends. 'They pass on helpful tips and cheer each other on.' As individuals lost weight and grew in confidence, they believed they don't need support from others and become distant . It added: 'But once the goal is in sight, consumers feel more certain and believe they don't need support from others, so they become distant and keep useful information to themselves.' In the Weight Watchers group studied by the researchers, every single member interviewed at the beginning talked of how they helped and got help from others. But by the advanced stage of their weight loss regimes, only 42 per cent said they were helping other members and 79 per cent said they were reluctant to share information. This can present a problem not just in Weight Watchers but any group that relies of mutual support, including Alcoholics Anonymous and other addiction-based organisations. The authors of the report wrote: 'As consumers move from the early stages of pursuing a goal to a more advanced stage, they change from being friendly to decidedly distant. 'And the more consumers distance themselves from others with similar goals, the more likely they are to feel disengaged and even give up on their goals entirely.'","Weight Watchers-style groups begin regime supporting each other .

"The Hemingway family were expecting a relaxing  Spanish getaway after spending more than £4,000 on a Thomson holiday. In the glossy brochure the self-catering Levante Lux Apartments in Benidorm looked modern, comfortable and bright. But when they arrived they were greeted by an unpleasant reality. They found 'punch holes' in three of the apartment doors, a loose sink and loose glass in the patio door. The Hemingway family paid £4,800 to stay in the Levante Lux Apartments in Benidorm, pictured left. The family found rusty metal work and exposed wires, pictured right, in the grounds of the apartment block when they arrived. They discovered mould, as well as damaged, unstable wardrobes in the bedroom. The Hemingways - including diabetic dad Mark - were unable to use the cooker as all the shelves had been removed. Outside, the family saw rusty metalwork and missing drain covers around the swimming pool - and they noticed that most of the sun loungers were broken. Mr Hemingway complained to a Thomson rep and asked to be moved, but was told there were no vacancies elsewhere. Shabby reality: In their apartment the family from Huddesfield found mould on the  walls, pictured  left, and a broken light, pictured right . After enduring four nights in the damaged flat, the Spanish owners of the complex moved the party of five adults and three children from Huddersfield, to the nearby Levante Beach which was cleaner and in better repair. The Hemingways have since been offered £307 compensation - but the family have turned it down believing they are entitled to £1,000 to cover their stay in the dilapidated apartment. The family also discovered punch holes through three doors . Mr Hemingway, 43, said: 'It looked fantastic in the brochure. The lady who booked it with us said it was a nice apartment and building and that she'd never had any complaints. The Thomson website says the Levante Lux Apartments 'combine the flexibility of self-catering with all the must-haves of a hotel.' The apartments are described as 'modern spaces' that have been 'thoughtfully decorated.' It adds: 'Simple whitewashed walls sport arty prints, while patterned soft furnishings keep things bright. 'All of them have good-sized kitchenettes, kitted out with all the self-catering essentials.' 'When we got there we thought we were in the wrong place,' said Mr Hemingway. 'The gates were rusty and had holes in them and the lights had exposed wires coming out of them. Sharon and Mark Hemingway were offered £307 compensation by Thomson, but they have turned this down . 'The front door of our apartment looked like it had been kicked in. 'When we eventually got moved they closed the rooms we were in to refurbish them.' 'We were unable to have a holiday until we were moved; it caused us some distress,' said the glazer. 'I would never use Thomson again.' A spokesman for Thomson said: 'Thomson is sorry to hear of Mr Hemingway's experience. The Thomson website promises apartments that are 'modern spaces that have been thoughtfully decorated' Thomson says guests will find 'Simple whitewashed walls sport arty prints, while patterned soft furnishings keep things bright' 'Our team in the resort did everything possible to assist Mr Hemingway during his stay. 'Following a review of his complaint we have offered him a gesture of goodwill. 'We would like to reassure customers that this hotel remains a popular choice for our customers.'","Hemingway family booked two week Spanish break with Thomson .

"A woman who suffered from crippling anorexia and survived on only Mini Weetabix and tea all day has recovered and become a dedicated runner. Izzy Mulkerrins, 19, who was born in Ireland but now lives in Sweden, began battling an eating disorder when she was aged just 11. Suffering from cystic fibrosis, Izzy looked for an aspect of her life she could control and her weight plummeted to just 6st 4lb, giving her a BMI of 13. Izzy's weight plummeted to just 6st 4lb (left), giving her a BMI of 13, at the peak of her illness but she has now turned her life around and is focusing on running (right), which she loves . But thanks to the support of her friends and family Izzy has turned her life around and has now regularly goes running - and is planning to do a half marathon. The student said: 'At my lowest point I would eat two Mini Weetabix, a quarter of an apple and a crispbread and around 10 black teas. 'I'd spend between two and four hours exercising each day and I'd try to do a lot of standing and walking as well. 'When I was in hospital I hit rock bottom. I realised that I couldn't keep going the way I was going. 'I wanted to live a life, I wanted to have my teenager years and to be happy and healthy.' Izzy first started her battle with anorexia when she was 11. Her parents divorced when she was five and as she got older she began to feel she had no choice in travelling between her parents each week. Izzy (pictured underweight left, and on the road to recovery, right) said her eating disorder began at age 11 . Izzy, pictured above) completed a midnight run and plans to do some charity runs and a half marathon . She looked for a way to control her life and turned to her diet. She said: 'I was beginning to think about the future and it scared me a lot. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, I didn't know who I was or what I was doing. I felt like I had no control. 'I have always felt this need to be free and not be controlled by anyone else so I began controlling my food. I have been tall and slim my whole life and always been told I can eat lots and so not eating was a form of rebellion as well. 'I suffer from CF as well and I believe that had a very large impact on me developing an eating disorder as well. I was often sick as a child and I had no control over it. 'I went through a phase where I stopped taking my medicines in the hope of being normal, but that just made everything worse and I became more sick.' Izzy spent almost two months in a children's psychiatric ward where she was tube fed for two weeks, and almost one and a half years in an eating disorder clinic where she was an inpatient five times and a day patient three times. She said: 'My eating disorder thoughts and habits began when I was 11 and at 16 I was declared healthy. Izzy, pictured while battling anorexia, said no eating was a way to bring control into her life . Izzy's parents divorced when she was five and as she got older she began to feel she had little control . 'I started treatment when I was 14, though it took me a year until I finally began to accept the help and begin recovery, and then it took me a year to recover mentally and physically. 'At my very worst I was very depressed - I saw no way out of the hell I was in. I didn't have motivation to recover either. 'I just accepted that I would always be sick because I didn't want to face my fears or my anxiety. I spent a lot of time thinking about suicide and planning suicide. 'I felt no happiness and no motivation when I was at my worst and the only thing that got me out of bed each morning was my fear of resting and being still, so I would only get up to exercise so I wouldn't gain weight.' Izzy is now looking healthier after her illness, and is hoping to help others recover . Since her recovery Izzy has concentrated on being happy and healthy. She has got back into running and completed a midnight run, which she has wanted to do since she was 12. Izzy also plans to do some charity runs and a half marathon. She said: 'I always loved running and working out so that was a motivation for me to keep going for recovery, though having exercise as the only goal to recover isn't always healthy as it can lead to an exercise addiction. 'I am now stronger than ever and what I went through made me who I am now. I would be a completely different person and be in a different situation. 'I now use my past experience to help others who are struggling though my blog - Life Without Anorexia - and I love knowing that I can help people chose life and to get through the hell of an eating disorder. 'When I was sick what I needed was someone to understand to give me advice and tell me things were going to get better, but I never got that so I'm helping others as much as I can so that they don't feel as lonely or hopeless.'","Izzy Mulkerrins, 19, who was born in Ireland but now lives in Sweden .

"Police said revelations about Jimmy Savile had encouraged other victims of sexual offences to come forward . Violent crime surged by 16 per cent last year and rape levels are at their highest ever level, official figures revealed yesterday. The number of violent attacks reported to police was 699,800 – almost 2,000 every day. There were also 24,043 rapes and 48,934 other sexual offences recorded by police in the year to September 2014, the Office for National Statistics said. In total, sexual offences rose 22 per cent. Home Office officials put the rise down in part to the ‘Jimmy Savile effect’, with the revelations about the paedophile and other high-profile figures encouraging victims to come forward with crimes that previously went unreported. The ONS figures come at the same time as a separate set of statistics, from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, revealed an 11 per cent fall in crime to seven million incidents. The result of the survey, which questions around 35,000 households, is the lowest estimate of crime since it began in 1981. Homicides in England and Wales were at their lowest level since 1977, at 482. It is thought the ONS findings on sexual offences may also have been influenced by better recording by the police – who have been under greater scrutiny following a row over claims they had been fiddling figures. The ONS figures are issued quarterly, with the previous release showing around 22,000 rapes in the year to June, which was then the highest level on record. There were 5,401 obscene publications and protected sexual material offences recorded by the police in the year to September, a 36 per cent rise. This is largely due to an increase in offences related to the making and distribution of indecent photographs, including those of children, via the internet or mobile phones. The ONS said police claim to be giving more attention to child sexual exploitation and this is likely to have led to more of these offences being identified. In the year to September the police recorded almost 500 rapes a week – or some 24,043 over the 12 months . Overall, police recorded crime showed no change from the previous year – at 3.7million offences. The College of Policing has introduced a new code of ethics which included changes to crime recording. It came after watchdogs raised fears that police were not logging offences properly. Chief Constable Jeff Farrar, the national policing lead for crime recording, said the spike in crime ‘is largely due to a renewed police focus on the quality of recording and a greater willingness from victims to come forward’. It said there were seven million crimes in the 12 months to September – down from 7.9 million in the previous year. This is the lowest level of crime in 30 years. David Cameron this morning welcomes the fall in crime. He said: 'It's encouraging to see that crime is at its lowest level since records began in 1981. The police are doing a great job.' Until recently, police-recorded crime figures had been showing year-on-year reductions. The stagnation in the overall figure comes after concerns were raised about the poor quality of the way police record crimes, prompting the UK Statistics Authority to remove the figures' official gold-standard status. The Home Secretary has overseen a fall in crime despite cutting the police budget by 20 per cent since 2010 . The Crime Survey for England and Wales, which measures people's experience of crime, revealed an 11 per cent fall in crime . Crime Prevention Minister Lynne Featherstone said: 'Police reform is working and crime is down by more than 20 per cent under this Government, according to the independent Crime Survey for England and Wales. 'There are now 2.4 million fewer crimes per year than when the coalition Government took office, and crime has fallen 63 per cent since its peak in 1995. This is good news for a safer England and Wales. 'In 2013, the Home Secretary commissioned Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to carry out an inspection of police crime recording in all forces, and expects chief constables and police and crime commissioners to act on its recommendations. 'We are already seeing the benefits of HMIC's scrutiny in more accurate crime recording. In addition, more victims of sexual offences and violent offences are coming forward - this is something we welcome. 'We have also transferred responsibility for crime statistics to the independent Office for National Statistics, introduced a new crime outcomes framework to provide greater transparency and abolished 'one-size-fits-all' performance targets. Under this Government, the police have one aim: to cut crime.'","In the year to September the police recorded almost 500 rapes a week .

"An apprentice butcher forced to have his hand amputated when it became stuck in a mincing machine is back at work, just 26 days after the horrendous accident. Thomas Stevens had only been working for six weeks when his right hand became trapped in the unsafe machine at P and K Meats in Street, Somerset. Paramedics were forced to amputate the then 16-year-old's hand after 30 minutes, with the teenager's boss later found guilty of health and safety offences and ordered to pay thousands in court. Thomas Stevens has returned to work at the butchers in Street, Somerset, just 26 days after losing his hand in a horrendous accident . After 26 days out of work, Thomas has returned to the shop, slicing up cuts of meat with a prosthetic hook. 'I just decided after my accident just to get on with it and not let it hold me back and carry on with what I love,' he said. 'It was a total of 26 days I was out for, that was it. I got bored just sat at home. 'I'm coping really well, I have learnt to adapt with what I have got, I'm doing really well. 'I have a prosthetic hook which I tend to use when I'm butchering and all that, it’s actually much easier, although I have to be careful not to cut my other hand!' The 17-year-old now uses a prosthetic hook to slice cuts of meat in the shop, which he says is 'easier' Thomas had only been working at the butcher for six weeks when his hand became trapped in the machine . Yeovil magistrates heard how Thomas had always wanted to become a butcher when he undertook training beneath Paul Jeffrey last summer. After six weeks in the shop, the teenager was using the meat mincing machine when his right hand became trapped. 'The victim was working at the meat mincing machine when his right hand entered the feed intake and became trapped,' prosecutor Lesley Dolan told Yeovil Magistrates Court, where Mr Jeffrey was found guilty of breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act. 'Fire and rescue and ambulance crews were called to the scene and his dominant right hand was amputated in situ and he was then taken to hospital.' The old machine had not been fitted with a guard since being bought by Mr Jeffrey despite a change in British Standards, the court heard. 'When he bought the premises he took over the lease and all the equipment and at the time it was manufactured it was sold as it is now and it had never had a guard fitted,' said his lawyer, Ian Dixey. 'However since then the British Standards have changed and all such machines come with a guard sitting over the top.' Mr Jeffrey was ordered to pay £15,000 after telling the court he felt 'personally responsible' for the accident. The teenager had always wanted to learn how to become a butcher when he undertook training at the shop . Determined not to let the accident get in the way of his ambitions, Thomas is back at work and enjoying his training once again . Thomas's employer was fined £15,000 in Magistrates Court after admitting to feeling 'personally responsible' for the teenager's accident . 'He enjoys trying to pass on the skills of the business to those who are working for him as he is a properly trained butcher,' Mr Dixey added. 'The accident was a terrible blow to him as he feels total responsibility for what happened. 'He has tried his best to make it up to Tom by training him and passing on what he knows and the most important thing is that he has learnt from this. 'He is quite well known locally and it is clear that a number of other shops realised they were not doing what they should have been and have been in touch with him to find out what is required by the local authority.' The butcher was spared jail, with magistrates accepting his guilty plea as a sign of remorse. 'We have also looked at the fact that others are relying on you for employment therefore it would not have been in anybody’s interests to imprison you or cripple you with huge fines,' said Susan Coates, chair of the bench. A separate claim for compensation on behalf of Thomas is being dealt with by the shop's insurers, the court heard.","Thomas Stevens had been working for just six weeks before the accident .

"It was the playground of a psychopathic rich kid. John du Pont inherited his parents' sprawling Liseter Hall estate in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, once used for rearing champion horses, and turned it into a wrestling camp. Training America's Olympic team, the crazed self-appointed head coach made eccentric orders. For example, to paint some of the vast buildings pitch black. In 1996, the once glorious property became the scene of horror when Du Pont shot dead Olympic gold medalist Dave Schultz. The story has been turned into an Oscar-tipped movie. And now the estate, too, has been given a new lease of life. Scroll down for video . John du Pont's estate in Newtown Square, PA, has been transformed into a luxury complex. Pictured is the newly-constructed clubhouse . Controversy: The property, pictured in 1996, where Du Pont trained the US Olympic wrestling team was the set for the movie Foxcatcher . Shooting: On January 26, 1996, Du Pont (pictured left, foreground) shot dead his assistant coach, Olympic gold medalist Dave Schultz (pictured left, behind). In this year's Oscar-tipped movie, Mark Ruffalo plays Schultz and Steve Carell plays Du Pont (together, right) Chilling: Du Pont (left) was ruled mentally ill and sent to jail where he died in 2010. Carell (right) is tipped for best actor for his portrayal . Vowing to restore Liseter to its triumphant days, the Toll Brothers razed the entire estate in 2013, losing Mr du Pont's mansion and the outhouse where Dave Schutlz lived and was killed. In its place, the company has built 449 carriage and single-family homes in six clusters on the 200-acre estate. Ranging from $600,000 to $1.1 million, they have attempted to maintain the original style in each home. And the barn has been transformed into a communal area surrounded by tennis courts, a pool, and a gym. 'There are vistas that were left untouched, and you can imagine what it was like in the heyday of the estate,' the firm's senior vice president, Brian Thierrin, told the Wall Street Journal. Communal area: This is the newly-transformed barn which is now a communal area with a bar and pool table, and tennis courts outside . New lease of life: This is one of the redeveloped properties on the sprawling estate, which range from $600,000 to $1.1 million . Restoring its glory: The estate was once a glorious horse-rearing farm with grand vistas and idyllic views from the numerous buildings . Old style: Using dark wood, paneling, and Art Deco patterns, the Toll Brothers hope to rejuvenate the original style of the estate . Enormous: This is a birds-eye-view of the landscape in Pennsylvania which was once home to America's wrestling team . It is a first attempt at rejuvenating the idyllic plains after Mr du Pont's erratic behavior cast it into a shadow of scandal - portrayed in this year's blockbuster movie by Steve Carrell, who is nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. A bird watcher by trade, du Pont was enthusiastic about sports, and transformed his property into a luxurious training facility before scouting a world-class wrestling team. With a swimming pool, shooting range, wrestling gym and accommodation for the sportsmen, du Pont lured Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz - played by Channing Tatum in the movie - to be his key player. Driven to a near mental breakdown, Mark eventually left Foxcatcher Farm to coach at Brigham Young University. After months of negotiations, Du Pont persuaded Mark's brother and coach, also an Olympic gold medalist Dave Schultz, to join the team in his place.

"The Humane Society of the United States claims a months-long undercover investigation of two roadside zoo's has found shocking abuse and neglect of exotic animals kept for profit. The Humane Society revealed their findings on Thursday which focus on what they call the persistent mistreatment of four tiger cubs and neglect that led to the death of a 24-year-old giraffe after she had given birth to twins. The HSUS conducted the investigations at Tiger Safari in Oklahoma and Natural Bridge Zoo in Virginia and found that cubs were punched and hit from three-weeks old to condition them for paying customers to have their photographs taken with them. Scroll down for video . Sad death for elegant giant: According to the Humane Society of the United States this 24-year-old giraffe passed away a year after giving birth to twins - which the animal apparently never recovered from . Exotic animals in captivity: The giraffe's death was just one example of cruelty alleged at the two zoos. Another witnessed was a spider monkey with a bone-deep hand wound - that apparently was not treated for weeks . Paying public: The financial incentives for the two roadside zoo's owners are great. They can charge anywhere from $50 to $1,000 for a photo shoot with a tiger cub . The Humane Society investigation also found a critical lack of veterinary care, crowded conditions and filthy cages, among other unsafe conditions. The undercover Humane Society members embedded themselves as staff at the two facilities and claim they witnessed the deaths of animals through willful mismanagement. The deaths included a baby camel who accidentally hung herself through neglect, a capuchin monkey who mistakenly ate rat poison and died and saw sick guinea pigs killed by slamming them into the ground. They also found a spider monkey with a bone-deep hand wound and a lone elephant who is locked away in a dark barn when she isn't giving rides to the public. Dragged: In footage shot secretly and supplied by the Humane Society a white tiger cub called Maximilian appears to be pulled along the ground against its will . Accused: The Tiger Safari in Oklahoma and the Natural Bridge Zoo in Virginia had employees with the Humane Society secretly join their staff for months last year . Struck: In this clip a woman is heard to call the tiger cub a 'b****' for biting her and then what follows appears to be a slap . Discipline: Another white tiger cub is hit on the nose while inside a small cage by one of his handlers . Wayne Pacelle, who is the president and CEO of the HSUS has called for the US Department of Agriculture to revoke both the zoo's licenses and for Virginia and Oklahoma to press cruelty to animal charges. According to the USHS, both their investigations witnessed how each zoo ran a profitable business out of using their tiger cubs for photo shoots with the public. The fees charges would vary between $50 to $1,000 per session. In a written response to the Associated Press, Natural Bridge Zoo owner Karl Mogensen called the allegations 'slanderous' and 'vicious propaganda' aimed at soliciting donations. He also denied the accusations. Tiger Safari has yet to respond to the allegations. Footage recorded in secret by the HSUS revealed the tiger cubs squealing in distress during these photo shoots and apparently being hit, punched, slapped and choked as discipline for misbehaving. The HSUS also alleges that the four cubs were taken away from their mothers just after being born and hand reared instead. Smiles: This family have a picture taken with an elephant at one of the two facilities: The Humane Society allege that one of the elephants at the two roadside zoos are locked away in a dark room after entertaining the public . Trust: This elephant is charged with giving rides to children around one of the grounds where mistreatment is alleged . The undercover investigation also claims in some instances that Tiger Safari and Natural Bridge Zoo put their cubs up for public handling when they were only three or four weeks old. Indeed, the HSUS also claims that the public are being exposed to potentially dangerous illnesses through the facilities mishandling of the tigers. One particular allegation is that a three-week-old tiger cub with ringworm was handled by 27 people after being transported to Tiger Safari in a 19-hour car journey from South Carolina. Another, white tiger cub called Maximus was seen to be dragged, punched and slapped by his handler at Tiger Safari and on one day forced to do 60 photo sessions with the paying public. Lurking in the background and a common domininator between both Tiger Safari and Natural Bridge Zoo according to HSUS is a group called T.I.G.E.R.S, which is based in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Tragic: Allegedly one capuchin monkey ate rat poison at one of the two facilities and later died . It is run by a man named Kevin Antle, who is known as a kingpin of the exotic animal trading world according to the USHS. According to the HSUS, 'Antle gives and takes cubs from both Natural Bridge Zoo and Tiger Safari. We don't know if any money changes hands – it's a secretive business and, unbelievably, these animals are bred indiscriminately all over the country and not tracked by any one agency for their lifetimes.' Ron Kagan, executive director and CEO of the Detroit Zoological Society told the HSUS: 'It appears that both operations are typical roadside zoos with amateur, reckless and harsh captive conditions and treatment. 'The physical discipline and examples of deprivation are clear as is the fact that the public is being put at risk by coming into contact with an animal capable of biting, clawing and spreading parasites.'","Tiger Safari in Oklahoma and Natural Bridge Zoo in Virginia accused of widespread neglect .

"An energetic and inquisitive seven-year-old girl whose mind is 'trapped in a body' that will not do what she wants has won £10.1 million damages. The award to Eva Totham, after a three-day hearing at London's High Court in December, is believed to be one of the highest ever made for a personal injuries claim following a contested trial. King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust accepted liability for the serious brain injuries suffered by Eva during her delivery in October 2007 but disputed some of the damages claimed. At fault: King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, above, accepted liability for the serious brain injuries suffered by Eva during her delivery in October 2007 but disputed some of the damages claimed . Eva, who lives with her parents Sarah and Dean and younger sister in south-east London, was starved of oxygen at birth and has severe cerebral palsy affecting all four limbs. Mrs Justice Elisabeth Laing said that the DVD she had seen of a day in Eva's life was 'very moving'. 'Eva is a beautiful, engaging child. Her eyes shine. She is determined and concentrates hard on any given activity.' In a ruling given today, she added: 'I had a strong sense of an energetic, inquisitive mind trapped in a body that will not do what Eva would wish it could do.' The compensation covers Eva's past and future care, as she is entirely dependent on others for all aspects of day-to-day living, and future loss of earnings. Ruling: Mrs Justice Elisabeth Laing awarded Eva Totham £10.1 million in compensation at London's High Court in December . Solicitor Agata Usewicz, of law firm Hodge Jones & Allen, said later: 'I would like to pay tribute to Eva's parents who have been strong and dignified throughout this lengthy process. 'Eva is a lovely, enthusiastic little girl who makes the most of life despite her limitations. 'This case, as with all of the clinical negligence cases that we handle, was not about money, it was about securing justice. 'No amount of money will ever compensate for the injuries Eva has sustained, but this award will ensure that she is provided with the care she needs for the rest of her life, and has the opportunity to live her life to the fullest.

"Sydney siege survivor Louisa Hope has turned down the chance to tell her story on national television, despite significant financial offers, because she doesn't want to 'exploit' the incident which saw three people killed. Ms Hope, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, has also closed down a funding account to help aid her medical bills, refusing to talk about the deadly attack. The former bank executive was used as a human shield by Man Haron Monis during the ordeal, and was shot in the foot during the dramatic end of the siege when Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson died. Scroll down for video . Louisa Hope, 50, was used as a human shield by Man Haron Monis, and is refusing to take money for her story . Ms Hope was allegedly picked by the self-styled sheikh as she could not put up a fight, as her MS drains her of energy and the ability to walk. Originally from Moruya on the far south coast of New South Wales, Ms Hope, 50, and her mother, Robyn, were having coffee at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place on Monday morning. Robyn, 68, has been noted for her bravery during the siege, refusing to leave her daughter and eventually injured from a shot to the shoulder, reported The Daily Telegraph. Ms Hope's stand against media interviews comes in the wake of a series of promotional videos in which many of the other siege victims recount their terrifying ordeal. 'She doesn’t want to be seen to be exploiting the situation and is really appropriate in what she does,' Craig Wallace, president of People with Disability Australia, told The Daily Telegraph. 'She already has to walk with a cane, and she is going to need a lot of support to get her back on her feet,' Mr Wallace said. Under the NSW Victims Rights and Support Act 2013, Ms Hope and her mother are only entitled to $1500 of compensation, and up to $30,000 for medical compensation. Robyn Hope, the mother of Louisa, was also held hostage in the Lindt cafe and was shot in the shoulder . Louisa Hope - who featured in a hostage video - is pictured here being stretchered out of the Lindt Cafe . Both Channel Seven and Channel Nine have secured exclusive interviews with several of the survivors, some of whom were reportedly paid up to $1 million for their stories. Siege victim Marcia Mikhael, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her legs, is believed to have secured a deal of between $350,000 and $400,000 to tell her story to the Seven Network, as the commercial rivals opened up their cheque books to secure survivors for their respective upcoming specials. The networks have been so desperate to snare the best stories for their head-to-head broadcasts, they have been sending out their stars to 'door knock' the 16 survivors to convince them to tell-all. One of the first to escape, John O'Brien, 83, who was seen running from the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place with barrister Stefan Balafoutis, will also speak on the Seven program. He's rumoured to have signed on for $100,000. Meanwhile, Channel Nine's 60 Minutes special is believed to feature up to 10 survivors who escaped after being held by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis for almost 17 hours. Gunman Man Monis told hostages they had '15 minutes' to live as the Sydney siege reached its tragic climax inside the Lindt Cafe last December . Hero: Tori Johnson, the manager of the Lindt cafe, tried to seize the gunman's weapon as the hostages frantically tried to escape . 60 Minutes has yet to announce when the program will go to air but the promotional videos are tagged 'Coming Soon'. The network told Daily Mail Australia: 'The siege story will (also) include interviews with two staff members of the Lindt Café who were held hostage during the siege: Fiona Ma and Harriette Denny.' 'At least another six survivors will be interviewed for the story.' Among those believed to have also been signed by Nine are Joel Herat and Jarrod Morton Hoffman, the sum total of all the interviews thought to be nudging $1 million. Daily Mail Australia understands the rival specials were set to air on Sunday February 1, which is the week when the television ratings season kicks off, rather than Australia Day as has previously been claimed. This would be after the coronial inquest starts on January 29. Hostages were forced to stand up against the Lindt Chocolate Cafe windows and hold up a flag by the gunman during the 17-hour ordeal .","Louisa Hope, 50, was used as a 'human shield' by self-styled Sheikh Man Haron Monis and was shot in the foot .

"The theory that a global firestorm accompanied the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs may not be correct, according to a new study. A team of researchers has found that heat near the impact site would not have been sufficient to ignite plants. It suggests our understanding of the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs may not be as complete as thought. UK researchers studied the asteroid impact 66 million years ago (illustration shown). They found the heat near the impact site in Mexico was not intense enough to ignite plant material. A heat pulse lasted less than a minute, too short to set plants alight . The team of researchers from the University of Exeter, University of Edinburgh and Imperial College London recreated the immense energy that would have been released from the asteroid impact 66 million years ago. They found that the intense but short-lived heat near the impact site could not have ignited live plants, challenging the idea that the impact led to global firestorms. These firestorms have previously been considered a major contender in the puzzle to find out what caused the mass extinction of life on Earth 66 million years ago. The impact site is believed to be the 125 mile (200km) wide Chicxulub crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. For years scientists have debated whether an asteroid, climate change or a combination of catastrophes were responsible for the demise of dinosaurs. But last year, a study claimed that the majority of the prehistoric creatures were wiped out by a perfect storm of ‘colossal bad luck’. Dinosaurs might have survived the asteroid strike that led to their extinction if it had come slightly earlier or later in history, scientists said. But when the six-mile-wide (10km) asteroid hit what is now Mexico approximately 66 million years ago, dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval, which left them vulnerable. The study by an international team of palaeontologists led by the University of Edinburgh looked at an updated catalogue of dinosaur fossils, mostly from North America. They found that widespread volcanic activity, changing sea levels and varying temperatures had weakened the dinosaurs’ food chain when disaster struck. If the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier, when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust, they may have survived, according to the study. A heat pulse in the surrounding the area lasted for less than a minute followed the impact. While this was too short to ignite live plant material nearby, the effects of the impact further away could have been sufficient to set some material alight. The researchers said as far away as New Zealand, the heat would have been less intense but longer lasting, heating the ground for seven minutes - enough to ignite live plant matter. But nearer the site such a scenario was unlikely, pouring water on the global firestorm theory. The experiments carried out in the laboratory showed that dry plant matter could ignite, but live plants including green pine branches, typically do not. 'By combining computer simulations of the impact with methods from engineering we have been able to recreate the enormous heat of the impact in the laboratory,' said Dr Claire Belcher from the Earth System Science group in Geography at the University of Exeter. 'This has shown us that the heat was more likely to severely affect ecosystems a long distance away, such that forests in New Zealand would have had more chance of suffering major wildfires than forests in North America that were close to the impact. 'This flips our understanding of the effects of the impact on its head and means that paleontologists may need to look for new clues from fossils found a long way from the impact to better understand the mass extinction event.' The experiments carried out in the laboratory showed that dry plant matter could ignite, but live plants  typically do not. Pictured is the fire propagation apparatus recreating the impact induced thermal pulse at the Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-Pg) boundary. Halogen lamps are delivering the thermal radiation in the image . Further away from the impact site in Mexico (shown), in places like New Zealand, the heat could have lasted up to seven minutes and caused some localised fires. But the theory that a global firestorm accompanied the asteroid impact is not correct, according to the scientists . Plants and animals are generally resistant to localised fire events - animals can hide or hibernate and plants can re-colonise from other areas, implying that wildfires are unlikely to be directly capable of leading to the extinctions. If, however, some animal communities - particularly large animals - were unable to shelter from the heat, they may have suffered serious losses. It is unclear whether these would have been sufficient to lead to the extinction of species. 'This is a truly exciting piece of inter-disciplinary research,' said Dr Rory Hadden from the University of Edinburgh. 'By working together engineers and geoscientists have tackled a complex, long-standing problem in a novel way. 'This has allowed a step forward in the debate surrounding the end Cretaceous impact and will help Geoscientists interpret the fossil record and evaluate potential future impacts. 'In addition, the methods we developed in the laboratory for this research have driven new developments in our current understanding of how materials behave in fires particularly at the wildland-urban-interface, meaning that we have been able to answer questions relating to both ancient mass extinctions at the same time as developing understanding of the impact of wildfires in urban areas today.'","UK researchers studied the asteroid impact 66 million years ago .

"Broadcasters scrambled to rescue their plan for election debates tonight after being accused of trying to 'call David Cameron's bluff' with an extraordinary plan to include a total of seven party leaders thrashing it out on TV. The Prime Minister had rejected a proposal which would have involved one of three debates putting him up against Labour's Ed Miliband and Lib Dem's Nick Clegg because it would have included Ukip's Nigel Farage. The PM said the Greens should have a slot. Under the new plan, Green leader Natalie Bennett would also be joined by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. But the plan immediately sparked complains from George Galloway's Respect party and Cornish Nationalists Mebyon Kernow. Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said the plans appeared 'designed to call David Cameron's bluff'. Scroll down for video . Tory leader David Cameron has come under pressure to sign up to debates with Lib Dem Nick Clegg and Labour's Ed Miliband . The new plan also includes (left to right) Ukip's Nigel Farage, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon Green leader Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood . The debates form a traditional part of US Presidential elections, but critics say they risked sucking the life out of the wider campaign. With the polls showing the election is widen open, with the rise of minor parties threatening to rob both Labour and the Tories of any hope of a majority, more have demanded a place in any televised showdown. In October the main broadcasters set out plans for three debates, with Ukip leader Nigel Farage offered a slot in one contest for the first time. Under the plans, Channel 4 and Sky News would host a debate between Mr Miliband and Mr Cameron, hosted by Jeremy Paxman. The BBC is planning to host a debate, chaired by David Dimbleby, between Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg – a repeat of the three-way format seen in 2010. ITV would host the four-way debate, including Mr Farage for the first time, chaired by ITV presenter Julie Etchingham. But Mr Cameron ruled out taking part unless the Green leader Natalie Bennett was included. Now fresh proposals have emerged which would see the BBC and ITV staging debates involving the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens, Ukip, the Scottish National Party and Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru. The third debate would remain a head to head between the Tory and Labour leaders, shown on Sky and Channel 4, it was reported. Asked if the 7-7-2 format would secure Mr Cameron's participation, a Conservative source said: 'Further discussions are planned and we will obviously look at any new proposals presented by broadcasters.'

In a joint statement, the broadcasters said they 'remain committed to providing election debates in the run-up to the general election'. 'The debates played an important role in informing millions of our viewers in 2010 and we will continue to work with all the parties to ensure that they happen again in 2015.' Ms Bennett - whose party organised a petition which attracted more than 280,000 signatures in favour of the party's inclusion - welcomed the news. 'Thank you to everyone who campaigned,' she wrote on Twitter.'We haven't yet had official notification but it looks like you succeeded.' SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said: 'If it is true that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be included in UK-wide debates under the broadcasters' new proposals, it represents very welcome progress. 'With a larger membership than the Lib Dems and Ukip combined, and more elected MPs than Ukip, the case for including the SNP in the televised debates is unanswerable.' With the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens all led by women, he said, it would 'rightly show that politics beyond Westminster isn't just an old boys' club'. Plaid leader Leanne Wood said: 'We have always maintained that it is an important democratic principle that people in this election should be presented with a clear picture of the choice that they face on polling day. 'This is a significant victory for the vast number of people who have campaigned for the inclusion of the anti-austerity parties in these debates. 'I look forward to taking part and making the case for Wales to have as strong a voice as possible in Westminster.' But parties that remained outside the wider debate proposals demanded inclusion. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Peter Robinson said he would be writing to the BBC and ITV demanding an explanation for the exclusion of his party - pointing out that with eight MPs, it had a larger Commons presence than the SNP (6), Plaid (3) or the Greens (1). George Galloway - the former Labour MP who now is the sole representative of the Respect Party in the Commons - posted on Twitter: 'Oi - what about me?' Mebyon Kernow's Dick Cole demanded better coverage for Cornish nationalism. He said: 'I welcome the fact that MK’s sister parties in Wales and Scotland could be included and it shows that the nature of politics is certainly changing across the UK. 'But as the Leader of Mebyon Kernow, the big questions for me are: Will these same broadcasters also guarantee fair and equal access to the media for MK during the election? And unlike in previous elections, will they allow MK its own Party Election Broadcastnd, And also unlike previous elections, equal coverage on media that broadcasts in Cornwall? 'I will be making representations to the BBC and Ofcom later tonight.' The latest YouGov poll shows how Ukip and the Greens have made big gains, while Labour and the Tories have struggled to get above 35 per cent . BBC director general Tony Hall told Radio Times it made 'absolute sense to have the involvement of the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Greens and Ukip'. 'This time round the debates are going to be more important to democracy than last time round. 'I don't know anyone who can call this election, therefore the notion of hearing those who are competing for your vote being tested and testing one another, is much more important than last time round.' A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: 'We have only just received these new proposals. 'We have always been clear that as a party of government, we must be able to defend our record in all the TV debates. 'We will continue to make that case in our discussions with the broadcasters.'","Scramble to rescue plan after David Cameron demanded role for Greens .

"One of Labour’s brightest rising stars has challenged Ed Miliband’s position on the private sector providing free NHS services, declaring: ‘What matters is what works’. Liz Kendall, a Blairite shadow health minister who is increasingly tipped as a future party leader, struck a markedly different tone on NHS ‘privatisation’ to Mr Miliband and her immediate boss, Andy Burnham. She also warned against Labour becoming ‘the moaning man in the pub’ and defended middle class voters with ‘sharp elbows’ who demand the best from public services. Liz Kendall, a Blairite shadow health minister who is increasingly tipped as a future party leader, struck a markedly different tone on NHS ‘privatisation’ to Mr Miliband and her immediate boss, Andy Burnham . Mr Miliband has accused the Government of ‘privatising and fragmenting the NHS’, though in fact there has been a much smaller rise in the number of NHS services provided by private sector providers under the coalition than there was under Labour. Mr Burnham, meanwhile, has called for a moratorium on new contracts being signed and claimed the Government wants to let ‘the market… carry on ripping through the NHS’. The shadow health secretary has also insisted ‘the NHS as we know it won’t exist’ if the Conservatives remain in power. But Miss Kendall, in an interview with political magazine The House, insisted: ‘There will remain a role for the private and voluntary sectors where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenges to the system. 'I believe what matters is what works. That’s what I’ve always believed in and I continue to believe in.’ She praised the privately-run independent treatment centres (ITSCs) first created by Tony Blair’s government, while she was an adviser in the Department of Health, which were credited with helping to cut NHS waiting times. Ed Miliband has accused the Government of ‘privatising and fragmenting the NHS’, though in fact there has been a much smaller rise in the number of NHS services provided by private sector providers under the coalition than there was under Labour . ‘I remember when I worked in the Department of Health a very senior clinician saying “you’ve got one of these ISTCs down the road now so I’m going to have to talk to some of my GP colleagues about getting my waits down and stop doing so much private practice”. ‘So it did bring challenge to the system. It was the NHS – and the increased investment we put in the NHS – that delivered the vast majority of the reductions in the waits. But some challenge in the system was crucial to that. ‘I think we need real reforms of our public services, including the NHS and social care, in many different areas.’ She backed the idea of medical consultations by Skype and iPhone, insisting: ‘It is a disgrace how little we have used technology to transform people’s experience. Andy Burnham has called for a moratorium on new contracts being signed and claimed the Government wants to let ‘the market… carry on ripping through the NHS’ 'This [she points to her iPhone] is part of my life now and that is how people increasingly expect to interact with the NHS. ‘Some people think “oh, it’s just some pushy middle class people wanting to get things from their doctor when and where they want”. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with making sure that our NHS needs to meet the needs and demands of middle class people or anybody else.’ Miss Kendall also suggested Labour needed to demonstrate how it would reform public services in an age of austerity. ‘Without doubt, post-financial crash, and the constraints in public spending that there rightfully has to be, it was very clear that the NHS needs to contribute to that as a whole,’ she said. ‘On the left we do have to show how we can deliver our goals of social justice and fairness when there’s less money around. But also because we need to make services work better for people.’ Asked whether she wanted to be Labour leader, the shadow minister said: ‘If anyone says anything nice about me it’s incredibly flattering. All I care about is winning on May 7. All I care about is getting Ed [Miliband] into Downing Street, full stop. That’s it.’ Labour has made the NHS central to its election campaign, issuing a poster claiming the health service ‘as you know it cannot survive five more years of David Cameron’ and claiming that public spending would be cut back to 1930s levels. Tory MPs accuse the party of hypocrisy and shroud-waving, since expenditure on NHS services provided free of charge by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the four years before, when Labour was in power. Overall, only around just six pence in every pound is spent in the NHS with the private sector, compared to around five pence under Labour.","Liz Kendall warned against Labour becoming 'the moaning man in the pub'

"If you have ever walked out of a shop laden with bags of treats that you didn’t really need, you may have fallen for one of many marketing tricks designed to make you part with your hard-earned money. Rounded prices and shops with ‘warm’ scents like cinnamon, encourage shoppers to buy products led by their emotions, according to a group of new studies. One of them found that colourful adverts make consumers increasingly likely to spend money on more expensive, frivolous items, than monochrome ones. Scientists have revealed that subtly changing how a shop smells, rounding up prices for emotion-led purchases such as clothing (illustrated with a stock image) and using colourful adverts, can encourage shoppers to buy products, including luxurious items . Researchers from the City University of New York, the Stevens Institute of Technology, New Jersey and Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania have shown for the first time that the ‘temperature’ of scents used in shops affect how much customers buy. ‘People smelling warm fragrances such as cinnamon feel that the room they are in is more crowded, and feel less powerful as a result,’ they said. ‘This can lead them to compensate by buying items they feel are more prestigious.’ They conducted several experiments to test how warm and cool scents affect consumer perception and decision-making, which were detailed in the Journal of Marketing. A team of researchers showed that 'warm' scents such as cinnamon (pictured) make consumers feel like they are in more crowded shops and feel less powerful as a result. They found that in such an environment, shoppers were likely to compensate for their lack of power by buying more items, including luxury products . Researchers in Singapore revealed that rounded numbers such as £50 appeal to people who are making emotion-led purchases, such as a camera for their holiday. Rounded prices encourage shoppers to rely on their feelings, rather than evaluating products, making them perfect for products for holidays, frivolous fashion items and even houses. However, non-rounded prices, such as £98.76, make consumers more likely to buy utilitarian items, such as a camera to use for a school project, appliances or cleaning products. The experts said that companies should be aware that small changes in pricing can have a big impact. When people in a room experienced a ‘warm’ scent such as cinnamon, they felt the room was more crowded than when they experienced a ‘cool’ scent - even though the room contained the same number of people each time. The people in the ‘warm, crowded’ room felt less powerful as a result of the perceived crowding, and were more likely to compensate for this loss of power by buying items, which they felt were luxurious and helped raise their personal status, the researchers explained. Shoppers in the warm-scented shop also bought significantly more items overall. This is despite the fact that the temperature  was never increased. The scientists believe that their study shows how retailers can easily encourage people to buy more high-end items, just by changing fragrance. Similarly, a study published in the Journal of Consumer Research found that rounded numbers such as £50 appeal to shoppers and make them more likely to buy ‘emotional’ products, than if they are priced at £49.99, for example. ‘A rounded price - $100 - encourages consumers to rely on feelings when evaluating products, while a non-rounded price - $98.76 - encourages consumers to rely on reason,’ researchers Monica Wadhwa of INSEAD, Singapore and Kuangjie Zhang of Nanyang Technological University said. ‘When a purchase is driven by feelings, rounded prices lead to a subjective experience of feeling right.’ A study published in the Journal of Consumer Research found that rounded numbers such as £50 appeal to shoppers and make them more likely to buy ‘emotional’ products such as clothing (illustrated with a stock image), than if they are priced at £49.99, for example . Five studies revealed that rounded prices make consumers more likely to buy a product when a purchase is primarily driven by feelings, such as buying a camera for a family holiday. However, non-rounded prices ($98.76) make consumers more likely to buy the same product when a purchase is utilitarian, such as buying a camera to use for a school project. The experts said that companies should be aware that small changes in pricing can have a big impact, so that products for holidays, frivolous fashion items and even houses could benefit from rounded prices. Meanwhile, companies selling practical products such as appliances and cleaning products could benefit from precise prices such as £29.58, for example. Another study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, said that when it comes to getting consumers to part with more of their cash, colourful adverts are more effective than monochrome ones. ‘Black-and-white images can lead consumers to focus on the abstract, essential, and defining components of a product,’ according to a group of researchers at Ohio State University. Treating yourself to a coveted gadget or luxurious item of clothing after a break-up may seem like a good idea, but a new study claims that so-called retail therapy makes people dwell on their failure. A joint study by the Erasmus University, Cornell, Northwestern and New York University found that consumers who buy premium goods after a failure are masking the problem, rather than recovering - and could even make things worse. The researchers said: ‘When consumers experience a psychological threat to how they would like to see themselves, buying products that signal accomplishment in the same area of their life could ironically cause them to dwell on their shortcomings. Retail therapy woes: A study found that consumers who buy premium goods after a perceived failure, such as a break-up,  (illustrated with a stock image) are masking the problem, rather than recovering . ‘This can strip consumers of their mental resources and impair their self-control.’ The study invited participants to recall a time when their intelligence was undermined and what they did about it. It found that those who opted for a form of retail therapy were unhappier in the longer term. ‘Consumption can sometimes compensate for our blunders and failures, but this doesn’t always work,’ the researchers said. ‘Consumers who use products to boost their sense of self-worth tend to dwell on their shortcomings and their ability to exert self-control is impaired. ‘After experiencing a setback in one area of their life, consumers might be better off boosting their sense of self in a different area of their life. ‘For example, a consumer whose intelligence is undermined might be better off signalling their self-worth socially rather than trying to assert their intelligence.’ The study was published in the Journal of Consumer Research. When it comes to getting consumers to part with more of their cash, colourful adverts (an example is pictured) are more effective than monochrome ones, which can lead consumers to focus on practical features . US researchers have shown or the first time that the ‘temperature’ of scents used in shops affect how much customers buy. 'Warm' smalls such as cinnamon make a shop feel more crowded and consumers fell less powerful as a result. They explained that this makes shoppers compensate by buying more luxurious items - and more products overall. The scientists believe that their study shows how retailers can easily encourage people to buy more high-end items, just by changing fragrance. ‘In contrast, colour images can draw attention to the concrete, sometimes unimportant and idiosyncratic features of the product.’ In one experiment, consumers were shown either monochrome or colour pictures of four shoes - plain sneakers, leopard print sneakers, plain heels and leopard print heels. They were asked to separate them into two groups. Consumers who saw the black-and-white pictures were more likely to categorise the shoes based on their function – high heels for looking glamorous and sneakers for exercise – instead of separating them by plain versus pattern. The study shows that the consumers looking at the monochrome images tended to focus on basic and practical product features. Consequently, the study suggests that colourful adverts have the power to distract consumers from thinking about practical features, such as a car’s efficiency, and instead pay more for unnecessary features, such as a flashy stereo. ‘Colour has become dominant in marketing because it attracts attention and promotes favourable attitudes,’ they said. ‘However, there may be times when companies might prefer to use black-and-white advertising. If a product’s primary features are superior, companies can successfully promote the product by using black-and-white images. ‘On the other hand, if a product’s secondary features are superior, companies should consider using colour images to draw attention to these otherwise easily overlooked features’.","Study shows cinnamon-like scents makes shops feel more crowded and consumers less powerful, so they buy more to compensate .
'Warm' smells also cause people to buy more luxurious products .
Researchers in Singapore found people are more likely to make emotion-led purchases like clothes, if prices are rounded, such as £50 .

"Home buyers are buying homes within the catchment areas of top public schools, while saving up to $500,000 on their children's education. Hot spots in Sydney include the Chatswood, Willoughby, St George and Fairfield, according to real estate giant Raine & Horne. While in Brisbane, the high demand regions are South Brisbane and Mansfield. Scroll down for video . Hot spots in Sydney include the Chatswood, Willoughby, St George and Fairfield, according to real estate giant Ray White. The diagram above marks out the catchment areas of the top public schools . In Brisbane, two of the top public schools are Brisbane State High School and Mansfield State High School . Victoria's top public schools include University High School, Albert Park College, McKinnon Secondary College, Balwyn High School and Glen Waverley Secondary College . In Sydney's west, properties near Westfields Sports High and the area around St George Girls High School are attracting higher price offers . Further south in Melbourne, the properties in McKinnon, Balwyn, Glen Waverley and Parkville and Albert Park are popular with parents, Domain reported. By buying in these areas, parents are saving up to almost $500,000 by sending their children to a public school as opposed to a private school but some of these properties are priced up to $1.9 million. Nationally, it would cost $456,933 to send a child born in 2015 to a private school but a public education would cost just $64,416, according to the Australian Scholarships Group. The difference in fees is $469,869 in Sydney, $302,222 in Brisbane and $432,739 in Melbourne. Sydney's North Shore has no shortage of elite schools, but Raine and Horne Chatswood/Willoughby principal Hugh Mcfarlan said it was also the prestigious public schools that were attracting parents to the area. He said parents were also willing to pay 5 per cent more to land a property in the catchment area of their preferred school. 'And it's not limited to owner occupiers - we get enquiries from tenants seeking a rental property within the catchment for particular schools,' Mr Mcfarlan said. One of the areas with a top public school is Balwyn, Victoria. This one on 20 Freeman Street has five bedrooms and six bathrooms . One of the listed features of this house by Ray White is that it is within Glen Waverley Secondary College's catchment area in Victoria . This house in Killara in New South Wales is within the catchment area of Killara High School. The price for this house is not listed but a three-bedroom penthouse in Killara is worth $1.8 million . While the area around St George Girls High School - in Sydney's south - is also attracting many buyers. The top Australian Tertiary Admission Rank at the school was 99.95 last year. In Sydney's west, properties near Westfields Sports High, which is Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke's alma mater, are attracting higher price offers. Raine and Horne Fairfield's Tarek Madani said he had a lot of enquiries about homes in the area rolling in. 'Many families considering a purchase in nearby Canley Heights and Fairfield West regularly ask whether a home is in the Westfield Sports High catchment,' he said. 'Owner-occupiers are often prepared to pay up to 5 per cent more to secure a home in the Westfield High catchment, while tenants will pay a premium of up to 10 per cent to lock in a rental.' Parkville is another suburb that has a top public school, University High School. It is priced up to $1.9 million . A property similar to this one on Wembley Grove in McKinnon, Victoria was worth $1.2 million . The trend is also happening in Brisbane, where houses around the catchment areas of Brisbane State High School and Mansfield State High School are selling fast. LJ Hooker's Michelle Rasmussen told Daily Mail Australia said like homes around the 'prestigious North Shore schools in Sydney are sought-after, we've noticed that same sentiment increase in Brisbane'. 'Being in the catchments of the top public schools and close to the private institutions is a strong selling tool,' she said. New South Wales .

South Brisbane: Brisbane State High School . Mansfield: Mansfield State High School . Victoria . McKinnon: McKinnon Secondary College . Balwyn: Balwyn High School . Glen Waverley: Glen Waverley Secondary College . Parkville: University High School, Parkville . Albert Park: Albert Park College . 'Top schools rank as high on a buyer's checklist as public transport, shops, cafes and medical facilities. It's quite a common factor.' Remax Executive Holland Park real estate agent Craig Barnes told Daily Mail Australia demand had increased in the Mansfield area in the past 18 months, with some people willing to pay 5 per cent higher than the asking price. 'Most properties I sell in that catchment is for future use of the school. Most of them are Asian or Indian background or descent who have high focus on education for their kids,' he said. 'The main difference is that we are getting multiple offers every time... and when we launch a new one we get enquiries all the time.' Mr Barnes cited better communication tools and money saving measures as reasons why he thought more parents were turning to Mansfield State High School as a good public school alternative. 'I don't if it's because it's more publicised on the internet now. I think [Mansfield State High School] works out to be the second best public school after Brisbane State High School,' he said. 'If they can get a similar education at a public school compared to a private school, then [parents] get to save a bit of money on education.' Meanwhile, Victorian real estate prospects are experiencing much of the same popularity in suburbs close to top performing schools. Glen Waverley Secondary College, in Melbourne's east, is a prestigious public school and real estate agent Peter To says parents were willing to pay up to $500,000 or more for a house in a catchment area compared to one that is not. This Highgate Hill property in Queensland is priced from a low to middle $1 million . Two apartments are available at this apartment block which overlooks Brisbane's CBD . It is conveniently located on Vulture Street, the same street Brisbane State High is located on . This house in Mansfield in Queensland is worth about $619,000 or more and inside the Mansfield State High School area . Accepting offers over $529,000, this Mansfield house is also within the high school area . The Ray White Glen Waverley area manager said the trend had been more noticeable in the past few years. 'We're getting more enquiries and people are willing to pay higher prices,' Mr To told Daily Mail Australia. 'Three years ago... the difference between home in a school zone compared to a non-school zone was $100,000, but these days it could be as much as $500,000. In other areas it could be even more.' Mr To believed it was a combination of three things that could be driving up this trend. 'Number one is the school, number two is [parents] can save some money [for education] but it's also [because the property is] close to the shopping centre, not just the school,' he said. 'And the third is prestige. When people know you live Glen Waverley, people will probably know you're worth more money than others.'","Nationally, almost $400,000 per child could be saved by parents if they chose to send them to a public school over a private school .

"The incredible story of a real-life 'War Horse' that dodged shellfire to deliver supplies to troops before walking back to the UK from Russia has been uncovered for the first time. The horse - nicknamed The Sikh - dodged shellfire and grenades as it delivered supplies to bloodied and battered troops on the trenches during the First World War. After the war ended in 1918, the animal walked all the way back from southern Russia to Devon, England. It echoes the plot of War Horse, the Michael Morpurgo novel adapted into an award-winning West End play and Steven Spielberg film. Scroll down for video . The horse - nicknamed The Sikh - was one of the one million horses  sent to battle during the First World War. The animal (pictured with Lt. Vicary) dodged shellfire and grenades as it delivered supplies to bloodied  troops . After the war ended, the horse walked all the way back from southern Russia to Devon, England. Pictured: The Sikh with owner Lieutenant Vicary and another officer in Tientsin, China, prior to the outbreak of the war . The incredible story was unearthed by Chris Chatterton, the curator of the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum, last week. He said: 'I was reading a book about The Glosters and I came across a mention of The Sikh. 'I did some more digging and it really is a remarkable story. She was viewed by many men in the Battalion as an Omen of good luck. 'A statue to honour The Sikh would be great. We will certainly be doing something at the museum to commemorate her.' The Sikh arrived at the front line with her devoted master Lieutenant A.C. Vicary, of the Gloucestershire Regiment Vicary, and the regiment's Second Battalion in Ypres. She was one of the million horses sent to the Western Front during the First World War. She was lucky to survive the conflict as only 67,000 returned home, after 933,000 tragically died. The brave horse was bred in Australia and sold to India. She arrived in North China with the 36th Sikh Regiment where passed into the ownership of Lt Vicary in 1913. When the battalion was given orders to return to Europe for war in November 1914, Vicary obtained special permission to take The Sikh with him. She was the only horse to accompany the Battalion from China, braving a treacherous eight-week boat journey from China to Europe. The incredible tale of the real-life War Horse was unearthed by Chris Chatterton, the curator of the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum, last week. Pictured: The Sikh stands in a field with a groomsman in Singapore . The Sikh (pictured) was a loyal companion to Lt. Vicary throughout the entire the First World War, supporting him and his troops in the reserve lines and support trenches. The horse later retired in rural Devon, England . The Sikh spent the voyage in a makeshift open box on the deck - exposed to stifling heat and typhoons as the ship travelled to the UK, dodging German battle ships in the Mediterranean, according to the ship's log. While the soldiers were banned from sleeping on deck because of atrocious weather, the horse was left out in the elements and only allowed to stretch her legs when officers went ashore at Hong Kong, Singapore, Port Said and Gibraltar. The Sikh was a loyal companion to Vicary throughout the entire the First World War, supporting him and his troops in the reserve lines and support trenches. The courageous pair led the 16th Gloucestershire Regiment in their victorious march through Serbia and Bulgaria. The Sikh managed to survive despite the desperate conditions for war horses. The incredible tale echos the plot of Michael Morpurgo's award-winning novel War Horse, which was adapted into a film in 2011. Pictured: Actor Tom Hiddleston as Captain James Nicholls with horse Joey in the film . The real-life War Horse even ended up retiring in Devon where Mr Morpurgo took inspiration for his novel . On average, the British Army lost 15 per cent of its horses every year of the conflict, though just a quarter of horse deaths were caused by enemy action, according to the War Office's Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire during the Great War, 1914-1920. The Sikh proceeded with the Regiment to South Russia, before following them home through Turkey, Greece, Italy and France once the war ended in 1918. Vicary ended the war as a Lieutenant Colonel, having one a Military Cross and two Distinguished Service Orders medals for his gallantry. After her illustrious and adventurous life as a war horse, The Sikh died in peaceful retirement at Vicary's home in Devon. Museum curators have noted that spending the remainder of her life in Devon, was reminiscent of the hero in best-selling Morpurgo's book.","Horse, nicknamed 'The Sikh', delivered supplies to First World War troops .

"Virgin Australia is  lowering fares as a result of plunging international oil prices cutting its fuel costs, sparking hopes other carriers will follow suit. Virgin has cut seat prices on flights from Australia to Los Angeles by $40AUS (£20) for economy fares and $50AUS (£25) for business class. The decision comes after Virgin Atlantic cut a £10 fule surcharge in December, yet other airlines have not yet offered savings to customers. Fare drop: Virgin Australia is cutting seat prices as a result of the plunging price of crude oil however few of the other major carriers are promising similar cuts . Virgin Australia said today it was lowering fares  in anticipation that fuel costs would continue to remain at lower levels than the record highs seen in recent years. A spokesman said: 'Over the past 10 years, despite oil prices reaching some historic highs, domestic airfares in Australia have gone down more than 20 per cent, driven by strong competition in the market.' However, despite calls by politicians in the UK, other airlines are yet to follow suit. They argue that buying fuel months and sometimes years in advance means they are yet to experience the saving caused by recent drops in oil price. Australian airline Qantas said: 'The bottom line for consumers is that Qantas fares already in the market are some of the cheapest in years.' Oil prices have fallen by roughly 50 per cent in the past four months with barrels of  crude trading for just $48 in London today. British Chancellor George Osborne has called on  to pass on the benefits of falling oil prices to their customers . A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said: 'As an airline, we buy our fuel months and years in advance which means that historically when we have had to increase our fuel surcharge this has not been at the same rate as oil costs have increased. 'Similarly, decreases in the price of crude oil do not lead to an immediate significant reduction in our on-going fuel costs. 'We’ll continue to monitor the situation and keep fuel surcharges under review to make them as affordable as possible.' Similarly budget airline easyJet say that as they too 'hedge' the majority of their fuel they are yet to benefit from the fall in the price of crude. A spokesman said: 'As at 18 November 2014, we had bought 80 per cent of our fuel until the end of September 2015 (at $944 per metric tonne) and 58 per cent for the period 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016 (at $921 per metric tonne) so oil price fluctuations will only have an effect on less than 20 per cent of our fuel this financial year and less than half our fuel in our 2016 financial year.' In the UK politicians are calling on companies to pass on the benefits of falling oil prices on to their customers . Earlier this month Chancellor George Osborne tweeted: 'Oil price was $53 pbl last night – lowest in 5yrs. Vital this is passed on to families at petrol pumps, through utility bills and air fares.' And Lib Dem Treasury Minister Danny Alexander has written to package holiday firms demanding they cut prices after oil fell to a six-year low. He said: 'Consumers have suffered the pain of high oil prices, it’s only right that companies and organisations do all they can to pass on as quickly as possible every last penny of oil price falls.'","Virgin Australia has slashed ticket prices for seats to LA by up to £25 .

"Dustin Diamond appeared in a Wisconsin court today to enter a plea of not guilty in a bar stabbing that occurred late last year. Diamond has been accused of stabbing a man at a bar after he became involved in an altercation with his girlfriend Amanda Schutz, who works as a clown named Loli Pop. The man claims he shoved Diamond and only later realized he had been stabbed. Diamond entered not guilty pleas to second-degree reckless endangering safety and two misdemeanors while Schutz entered a not guilty plea to misdemeanor disorderly conduct. Scroll down for video . Dustin Diamond and girlfriend Amanda Schutz (above) looked glum as they headed into a Wisconsin court today . Diamond entered a plea of not guilty in response to charges stemming from a bar stabbing that occurred late last year . Diamond entered not guilty pleas to second-degree reckless endangering safety and two misdemeanors while Schutz entered a not guilty plea to misdemeanor disorderly conduct . Dustin says he was protecting his girlfriend from two men when he unintentionally stabbed someone with a switchblade . On Christmas night, the actor - who played Screech on the popular nineties series Saved by the Bell - was arrested and charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety; carrying a concealed weapon; and disorderly conduct, use of a dangerous weapon after getting into a fight at the Grand Avenue Saloon in Port Washington, Wisconsin. After the  fight Diamond fled the scene along with  Schutz. Officers soon located the two and both were taken into custody, where Diamond said that he was trying to close out his tab to avoid intoxicated people he thought were going to 'brawl' when he turned around and saw two men grabbing his girlfriend's hair as she bled. As he went to help her he claims a man grabbed him and that is when the incident occurred. In a police report obtained by CNN, it said; 'Diamond stated that he did not intentionally stab the individual in the bar but that chaos broke out and people were grabbing at him and that he swung his arms to break free.' Other bar patrons claimed 'a women was upset because people were taking pictures of her and her boyfriend,' and shoving broke out. This after TMZ claimed the Celebrity Fit Club alum and his girlfriend allegedly got into a dispute with another couple at the bar because they were being photographed, the website reported. After the couple exited the establishment, things escalated when Dustin's girlfriend reportedly pushed the woman. That is when the actor pulled out a knife, it was claimed. The victim is reported to have suffered a half inch wound and bled heavily. The couple who Dustin argued with then fled before authorities arrived, according to the report. Authorities found the weapon in Diamond's possession in his car, and his girlfriend was booked on a disorderly conduct charge, though she was later released. Schutz (above) was arrested and then released on Christmas night . Diamond (above) has been out on bond since the Christmas night stabbing . Dustin's girlfriend works as a clown in the area and goes by the name Loli Pop . According to Linked In, 'Loli Pop the Clown is fun, lovable, and the perfect entertainer for children of all ages' Meanwhile cops are hoping to get their hands on another video taken on the scene as the one they currently have is a little bit to shaky for them to clearly see the incident. According to state regulations, owning a switchblade or any 'blade which opens by pressing a button, spring or other device in the handle' is against the law.

In 2006 he released the sex tape Screeched - Saved By The Smell. Later he told Oprah that he used a stunt double for the tape. Dustin has been working in reality TV more recently. He made an appearance in Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling in 2000, Celebrity Fit Club in 2007 and Celebrity Big Brother in 2013. In 2009, Diamond published an inside story of the show's cast and crew, from his point of view, titled Behind the Bell. In 2009 he also reportedly got married to Jennifer Misner, his longtime girlfriend, though a rep for the actor said the two are no longer together. In November he looked to be in good spirits as he co-hosted the Saved By The XIV party at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. On Tuesday, Dustin made a return to Bayside High School in a parody segment for truTV's Friends Of The People, where the actor performed the role of a high school principal.

"Prosecutors were accused of pursuing a vendetta against four Sun journalists yesterday after they announced a retrial in a deadlocked case that has cost millions. After a three-month hearing at Kingston Crown Court, jurors failed to reach verdicts on the journalists, who were accused of paying public officials for information. The Crown Prosecution Service has put a number of journalists on trial after investigations into phone hacking and corruption, but several recent cases have ended in acquittals or hung juries. After a three-month hearing at Kingston Crown Court (pictured), jurors failed to reach verdicts on the journalists, who were accused of paying public officials for information . Concerns have been raised about the millions spent on the cases and the length of delays between arrests and trials, with one journalist waiting more than three years. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said it was ‘deeply disappointing’ that the Sun journalists’ trial was still not completed. The committee would address concerns raised by the case, he added. Tory MP Tracey Crouch said: ‘These journalists have had their lives turned upside down while they awaited trial for over three years, and then after three months of court time and a bill of several million pounds to the taxpayer, the CPS wants to drain millions more from the coffers because they didn’t get the result they wanted. Labour MP Keith Vaz (pictured), chairman of the home affairs select committee, said it was ‘deeply disappointing’ that the Sun journalists’ trial was still not completed . ‘They are a joke and rather than pursue this vendetta, they should concentrate on bringing real criminals to justice.’ Former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman, 51, head of news Chris Pharo, 45, former deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll, 38, and reporter Jamie Pyatt, 51, were accused of paying police officers, prison guards and a worker at Broadmoor Hospital. They all deny any wrongdoing over the alleged payments. The newspaper’s picture editor John Edwards, 50, and former reporter John Troup, 49, were cleared of corruption. The jury also cleared O’Driscoll and Dudman of some charges, but failed to reach verdicts on the remaining counts against them. Judge Richard Marks praised the ‘great dignity’ of the defendants and said the retrial must be scheduled this year so their wait for justice was not delayed further. Media lawyer Gavin Millar QC, of Matrix Chambers, said vast amounts of public money would be wasted, but there was ‘no realistic prospect of conviction’. The CPS said it would be inappropriate to comment ahead of a retrial.

"They might have made it safely to the ground, but 52 skydivers are still jumping...for joy. A big congratulations is in order since they've become world record holders after mastering an advanced flight formation above Phoenix, Arizona. In the footage, shot through one participant's helmet-mounted camera, the daredevils are initially seen huddled together while fist-pumping in excitement as they prepare to take the plunge. Triumph! A group of international skydivers have managed to break a world record in Phoenix . Sun set: One participant videoed the incredible moment that the group formed a challenging 52-person formation in the upright position . The challenge, which took place on 22 November 2014, involved around 60 skydivers occupying three separate planes. Their nationalities range from British to American, Russian, Australian, Canadian, Mexican and German. As they pour out of their aircraft, one after the other and glide through the sky, 52 of them manage to grab each other's hands. Together, they form a remarkable upright display. Just plane crazy! Around 60 people piled in to three jets to take part in the dive . Persistant: The 52 people who succeeded in connecting together broke a world record that 44 group members set just the day before . Keeping it up! Those 44 skydivers were keen to go even bigger, which is exactly what they did . The man donning the recorder, Zachary R Sabel from Rochelle, Illinois, explains that 'Head Up body flight is the most difficult position to balance while being able to build formations. 'In head up flying, we are balancing mass over lift, so you are battling aerodynamics the entire time.' He adds: 'It's kind of like riding a wheelie on a bike, you always want to tip over, or never get the wheel off the ground. 'The vibe at this event was purely amazing. It was such an honour to fly with this group of athletes.' The skydivers broke the record twice over the course of 48 hours, initially performing the position with 44 people and then deciding to go even bigger with 52.

The widow has been seen a lot in public in recent weeks after the opening of American Sniper, the blockbuster movie starring Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller, based on her husband's life. The movie, which has already earned at least $105million at the box office, has set a record for the highest-earning January opening and created a great deal of Oscar buzz. The hunting ad featuring Taya Kyle for riflemaker Weatherby, was released on the same day as the Hollywood biopic about her husband, American Sniper. Pictured is the antelope that Mrs Kyle killed on the hunt . The mother-of-two said that while on the hunt, she felt like her late SEAL veteran husband was with her every step of the way . Chris and Taya Kyle, pictured in April 2012. She said in the ad that when she took a hunting trip in his honor, she felt that her late husband was with her . Mrs Kyle, who has two children with her late husband, became emotional as she remembered her husband on the hunting trip . The film tells the story of Mr Kyle, a sniper, who was credited with saving hundreds of American lives by making 160 confirmed kills,  the most in U.S. military history. In February 2013 after retiring from the military, Kyle and a friend, Chad Littlefield, took 25-year old Eddie Ray Routh, a veteran suffering with severe PTSD, to a remote shooting range in Glen Rose, Texas. Before they reached the range Routh, 25, shot both men dead and stole Kyle's customized pick-up truck. Since his death, Mrs Kyle, who has two children with her late husband, has been prolific in promoting his charity, the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation (the skeleton of a frog is the symbol for a fallen Navy SEAL). Mrs Kyle and another hunter celebrate over their kills during the trip to the wilds of Wyoming .

"A vigilante who put a man in a choke hold without warning from behind when he saw him enter a Florida Wal-Mart with a concealed firearm has been charged with battery. Michael Foster, who is white, decided to take the law into his own hands on Tuesday morning and launched himself on Clarence Daniels, who is black, fearing a shooting. Foster, 43, was helped by other shoppers in the Brandon store, but when sheriff's arrived they discovered that 62-year-old Daniels possessed a permit for his gun and arrested the would-be hero. Would-be-hero: Clarence Daniels (left) is seen walking into the Brandon Wal-Mart surrounded by children before Michael Foster approaches from behind and grabs onto him . Struggle: Foster and Daniels begin to struggle on the floor - during which Daniels allegedly shouted out to Foster that he was legally able to carry a firearm . Assistance: Foster is helped by two other men in the struggle as a shopper and her child carry on by . Recovered: The men disarm Daniels despite his repeated protestations that he has a license to carry a concealed firearm . Frightening: The incident is seen here from another angle in the Brandon Wal-Mart as shoppers scramble away . According to deputies, Foster told them that when he saw Daniels get out his car he caught sight of a gun under his coat, in a holster. Foster followed Daniels into the Wal-Mart, but did not call 911 before he attacked Daniels nor did he alert security. Indeed, during the brief struggle, which caught Daniels completely by surprise, he screamed out that he was licensed to carry a firearm, but Foster ignored that and told him to wait for the sheriff's to arrive to decide. Three other men helped Foster to hold Daniels down until law enforcement arrived, despite his pleas to let him go. Arrest: Michael Foster (left) was charged with battery and Clarence Daniels (right) is seen talking to a sheriff's deputy after the attack . When Hillsborough sheriff's arrived and separated the men and discovered the cause of the melee they promptly arrested Foster on a charge of battery. Video of the incident shows the shocking moment that Foster strikes and puts Daniels into a choke hold without any warning. Women and children scatter as Foster yells out that Daniels has a gun. One witness, spoke to Fox News said that he was shocked by the incident and worried what could have happened. 'He doesn't even know who the victim is,' said Manton Sameuls. 'But he just goes and attacks the man and throws him to the ground, necklock him, for what? Why? What did the man do?'","Michael Foster has been charged with battery for the incident at Florida Wal-Mart .

"Climate change alarmists have been likened to a fanatical 'cult' by an MIT professor of meteorology. Dr Richard Lindzen told a Massachusetts-based radio station that people who believe in global warming are becoming more hysterical in their arguments. 'As with any cult, once the mythology of the cult begins falling apart, instead of saying, oh, we were wrong, they get more and more fanatical,' he said. Dr Richard Lindzen (right) told a Massachusetts-based radio station that people who believe in global warming (stock pictured left) are becoming more hysterical in their arguments. 'As with any cult, once the mythology of the cult begins falling apart, instead of saying, oh, we were wrong, they get more and more fanatical,' he said . 'You've led an unpleasant life, you haven't led a very virtuous life, but now you're told, you get absolution if you watch your carbon footprint. It's salvation.' According to Howie Carr at Breitbart, the 74-year-old highlighted reports by Nasa that 2014 was the hottest year in recorded history. He points out that the Nasa climate scientists who made the claim was only 38 per cent sure this was true. 'Seventy per cent of the Earth is oceans, we can't measure those temperatures very well,' he said. 'They can be off a half a degree, a quarter of a degree. In 1990, the UN's climate panel predicted with ‘substantial confidence’ that the world would warm at twice the rate that has been observed since.  The IPCC report found that, by the end of the century, the emission of greenhouse gases will bring temperatures that are about 3.7°C (6.7°F) warmer . The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report was published in November. It said continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes. This will increase the likelihood of 'severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.' Such impacts include extreme weather and rising sea levels, heat waves, flooding and droughts. Ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life. Without changes in emissions, 'climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century.' At the current rate, by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 2°C (3.6°F) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005. By the end of the century, that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7°C (6.7°F) warmer. The impact on the Earth could already be considered dangerous, the report claimed. 'Even two-10ths of a degree of change would be tiny but two-100ths is ludicrous. Anyone who starts crowing about those numbers shows that they're putting spin on nothing.' Dr Lindzen was a lead author of Chapter 7, 'Physical Climate Processes and Feedbacks,' of the IPCC Third Assessment Report on climate change. But he has previously blasted the IPCC for blaming humans for a global warming trend that appears to have cooled in recent decades – and then glossing over the warming slowdown. 'I think that the latest IPCC report has truly sunk to level of hilarious incoherence,' Dr Lindzen told Climate Depot – a site known for questioning the theory of global warming. A number of studies have suggested that powerful winds in the Pacific Ocean, which have driven surface heat deep underwater, could be the reason behind the current 'pause' in global warming. The IPCC has said that rising temperatures will exacerbate poverty and damage land and marine species. It also claims that the world is in 'an era of man-made climate change' and has already seen impacts of global warming on every continent and across the oceans. On Tuesday, President Obama said that 'no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change'. He has pledged that he would veto legislation turning back White House efforts on the environment. Since 1880, Earth’s surface temperature has warmed by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius). The IPCC says rising temperatures will exacerbate poverty and damage land and marine species .","Comments were made by professor of meteorology, Richard Lindzen .

"Despite the unsavoury snobbery that still existed when he rose to become a Tory minister in 1979, Leon Brittan, whose parents were Lithuanian Jews, exemplified the meritocratic nature of Thatcherism. Brittan’s father had arrived in this country in 1927 without much money, to work as a doctor in North London. Leon won a scholarship to Haberdashers’ Aske’s School (his brother Sir Samuel, a distinguished economics commentator, attended Kilburn Grammar), and went on to the richest and grandest of all the Cambridge colleges, Trinity, to read law, before securing a postgraduate fellowship at Yale. He immersed himself in politics, becoming president of the Cambridge Union and chairman of the University Conservative Association. Scroll down for video . True blue: Leon Brittan rose through the ranks of government under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . His was a gilded generation of student politicians such as Norman Fowler, Ken Clarke, Michael Howard, John Gummer and Norman Lamont, who went on to be part of the government together. But as one of them put it to me, they all regarded Brittan as ‘very exceptionally able’. Called to the Bar, he devoted his spare time to politics, becoming chairman of the Bow Group — a nursery for ambitious ex-Oxbridge politicians — and fought the unwinnable Labour seat of North Kensington at the 1966 and 1970 elections. In 1974, after 15 rejections elsewhere, he found a safe seat and remained an MP until 1988. His first government job was as a Home Office minister and he then joined the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, responsible for implementing the severe spending cuts that marked the first term of the Thatcher government. He won great respect for the way in which he not only mastered a very complicated brief, but for the calm way in which he implemented some intensely controversial spending restraints. It was probably the most distinguished passage in his political career, though a decade later he would be praised for the efficiency and competence with which he completed the European Single Market. Cabinet: After the 1983 election, still aged just 43, Brittan (seated, fourth from right) became the youngest Home Secretary since Winston Churchill in 1910 . However, he was not universally liked, his occasionally shy manner coming across as arrogance or a sense of superiority, leading fellow Tory Alan Clark to describe him as ‘oily, loathsome’ and ‘without a political principle’. He married late — at the age of 41 — shortly after entering government — to Diana Clemetson. The couple were happy for 35 years, and Brittan became a devoted stepfather to his wife’s daughters from a previous marriage. After the 1983 election, still aged just 43, he became the youngest Home Secretary since Winston Churchill in 1910. His ultimate responsibility for the controversial policing of the miners’ strike was a severe test of his presentational skills that he did not entirely pass. Crushing blow: Brittan, pictured in 2013, resigned after Mrs Thatcher admitted his part in the leaking of the letter which criticised Michael Heseltine . Also, at a time of IRA outrages, he also became unpopular with the Tory Right over his ambivalence on the death penalty. He was moved after two years to Trade and Industry — mainly because Mrs Thatcher considered him a poor communicator, but also because she was dissatisfied by the progress Brittan had made in persuading the BBC not to give the ‘oxygen of publicity’ to IRA terrorists. Within months he was embroiled in the ferocious Cabinet debate over Westland, a British helicopter company. Brittan was admirably loyal to Mrs Thatcher, and imagined he was doing her bidding when he authorised the leaking of a letter from the Solicitor-General that criticised his Cabinet colleague Michael Heseltine, the Defence Secretary. Heseltine was trying to put together a European consortium to buy Westland, while Mrs Thatcher backed a rescue by Sikorsky, an American firm. Furious that no one would listen to him, Heseltine resigned and stormed out of a Cabinet meeting. It was later disclosed that Brittan had done more to destabilise the European deal than just authorise the leak. He sought to persuade two British firms in the consortium, British Aerospace and GEC, to leave and, effectively, cripple it. When Mrs Thatcher was forced to admit his part in the leak, Brittan resigned, having been cut adrift by Tory MPs outraged that he had put her in such a vulnerable position — but for a typically blundering performance by Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, she might have been forced from office. She tried to persuade Brittan not to go, but he knew he had no other support. It was a crushing blow for an ambitious man, still only 46 and with, as he saw it, more glittering prizes ahead of him. In due course, Mrs Thatcher offered him a consolation prize — one of Britain’s two European Commissioners’ jobs. I had a rare insight into his thinking over the appointment — having coincidentally arranged to have lunch with him on the day in 1988 he had been told. He confided that he had serious doubts about taking the job, believing he had a future, instead, at Westminster as a Cabinet minister. Pro-Europe: Serving the European Commission for ten years, Brittan was responsible for advancing the career of Nick Clegg, who, in 1994, became one of his advisers. Also — and it is strange to recall this now considering how fervent a European he subsequently became — he expressed profound Euroscepticism, saying he found the way the European Commission did business unattractive and contrary to British interests. It wasn’t long before he ‘went native’ — one of the most fervent imaginable apologists for the European Union, and a strong advocate of closer European integration. Serving the Commission for ten years, he was responsible for advancing the career of Nick Clegg, who, in 1994, became one of his advisers. As his last years were clouded by sordid allegations, his loyal circle of friends — many of them from Cambridge days — regarded him with admiration and affection. They believed the lurid claims were simply a smear, and that this elder statesman deserved better. Whatever the truth, one thing is beyond doubt. But for one foolish misjudgment over the Westland leak, Leon Brittan’s career might have been radically different, and he would have died a far more considerable figure in our politics than he was fated to be.","Leon Brittan rose through the ranks of government under Thatcher .

"Chicago is once again the hub of American travel, according to new data released by the Federal Aviation Administration. The Windy City's O'Hare International Airport reported the highest number of flights of any U.S. airport for the year of 2014, despite a slight decrease in travel at the airport. But because it's main competitor, Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, suffered an even greater loss in traffic, Chicago won back the title of highest-trafficked airport - an honor it lost to the southern city in 2005. Busy, busy: Chicago's O'Hare International Airport is again the most highly-trafficked airport according to new data released by the FAA . 1.Chicago O'Hare - 881,933 . 2. Atlanta - 863,359 . 3.

The Chicago Sun-Times said that these numbers are 'the traditional yardstick by which the title of ""world's busiest"" has to be bestowed'. One reason that Chicago traffic is up this year is because O'Hare and Midway airports have added six new international airlines servicing dozens of destination in the last 18 months, city officials said.

"Money worries, dead-end relationships and unfulfilling jobs were among the reasons many Brits said they were fed up, a blu eCig study revealed . We're shivering in the sleet, struggling to pay Christmas bills and all those New Year's resolutions have gone up in smoke. No wonder we're a nation of miseries. Just three in ten of us are happy with our lives, a study has revealed. Money worries, dead-end relationships and unfulfilling jobs were among the reasons many said they were fed up. The study of 2,000 people found that 69 per cent feel trapped in the same old routine and more than 40 per cent are unhappy with their lives. Lifestyle niggles, worrying about their image and even the British weather were listed among the top 20 reasons for feeling worried, with nearly three-quarters succumbing to the winter blues. Just seven per cent described themselves as very happy with their image, while a confidence-lacking 40 per cent of people are actively unhappy with the way they look, results showed. Commissioned by blu eCigs, the study revealed that the majority of people don't make changes to their lives because they struggle to know where to start. Jacob Fuller, CEO of blu eCigs, said 'A lot of people set out to make changes to their lives in January but find it a struggle and end facing a case of the January blues. 'The results show that making smaller, positive lifestyle changes rather than setting drastic unattainable targets is the best route to improve overall happiness.' Relationship stresses also take their toll - results found one in five feels their relationship has declined in recent times, while the same number felt there isn't a future with their current partner. And work life brings little respite - nearly a quarter don't feel they're going anywhere in their job. Just a quarter of people felt their career had gone to plan and were actually able to do the job they originally hoped to do. 1. Getting old in general . 2. Worried about my savings/ financial future . 3. Low energy levels . 4. My diet . 5. Financial/credit card debts . 6. Job security . 7. Wrinkles or ageing appearance . 8.

The study, titled the 2015 UK Optimism Audit, found that while more than three-quarters of people think that New Year's resolutions are ineffective, most of us do see the value in making incremental changes to our lives. Seventy per cent believe that changing just one small thing would make an improvement to their happiness levels. The majority don't make changes to their lives as they struggle to know where to start. Showing the value of small changes, half of those that smoke said swapping to an e-cig would improve their lifestyle.

"Skiers are being invited to add a bit of luxury to their trips to the slopes by opting for a helicopter transfer from airport to their resort. PrivateFly has launched a new helicopter service, offering exclusive fixed pricing on private helicopter transfers to popular European ski resorts that starts from just £185 each way per person. The private jet booking service says the service has been launched to reflect increasing demand for shorter ski breaks and shorter booking lead times – and offers market-leading prices and service. The helicopter transfers will whisk skiers to the slopes form the airport from £185 . It is available to those who want to book a helicopter flight only, in addition to the company's private jet clients. Adam Twidell, CEO of PrivateFly, comments: 'With the popularity of short ski breaks on the rise, it's never been more of a priority to maximise time on the slopes – and minimise the time to get there. 'Our existing private jet clients know how many hours can be saved by landing as close as possible to the resort, by using smaller airports. Helicopter transfers make the journey even faster, and can be combined with a private jet flight or an airline flight. 'For example a helicopter transfer from Grenoble to Courchevel takes just 25 minutes, compared to a drive time of between two and three hours – even longer in busy traffic. For a return journey this can gain an extra half day on the slopes. 'We are seeing more clients booking ski breaks at short notice and our private charter helicopter service is fast, transparent and easy to arrange. We have secured preferred fixed rates with local helicopter operators, so there is no waiting around for a quote. With the price of renting a car being as much as £600 a week at some ski resorts, taking the helicopter works out as the cheaper option . Taking a helicopter from airport to ski resort is perfect if families are on a short-time trip . 'Of course the luxury of a helicopter transfer can add considerably to the enjoyment of a ski trip, but it is the compelling time-saving benefits that attract many customers.' The new service offers helicopter flights from 14 airports in France and Switzerland, directly into popular ski resorts, such as Meribel, Courchevel, Val D'Isere and Val Thorens. There is a choice of helicopter type - from a single engine AS350 (seats five or six) to a EC155 twin engine helicopter, which offers a faster journey; spacious VIP club seating for 6 people; and a bigger luggage capacity. Several of the helicopter models also offer additional secure storage for skis underneath the aircraft. The idea of taking a helicopter ahead of the road is hoping to take off in New York too. Airport shuttle service Gotham Air are chartering flights from Manhattan to both JFK and Newark Liberty Airports from just $99 (£65). Taking the helicopter in New York will ease the stresses of airport travel . What's more it will give you plenty of time to make your flight - the expected journey time is cut from two hours by road to just six minutes. And the cost is equivalent to that of a black cab. The special $99 fare applies to first-time flyers however, thereafter it will range from $199 - $219. PrivateFly says its prices are fixed and instant, unlike other helicopter companies, whose prices can vary on the same route, and who can take hours to quote. Prices per person start from £185 (€243) for a one-way flight from Annecy to Courchevel, based on a group of six travelling together in a AS350 (€1460 for the whole aircraft). The helicopter option may not seem so exclusive after all as travellers heading for the piste this half-term face a barrage of extra costs at the car rental desk meaning they could end up paying over two times as much as they had originally budgeted for. iCarhireinsurance.com, the leading provider of stand-alone car hire excess insurance, researched seven European ski gateways to see how a traveller’s costs snowballed on picking up their hire car. Hiring a car for the week across the seven locations of Geneva, Grenoble, Turin, Innsbruck, Barcelona, Sophia and Inverness costs on average £214. However once 'extras', paid for at the rental desk, are factored in a traveller could be looking at an average final bill in the region of £600. Geneva is the most expensive place to hire a car to go skiing. It costs on average £313 to hire a car, plus on average £486 for the extras. Sofia is the most reasonable place to hire a car to go skiing, with rental costs averaging about £130 and extras at £202. Extras include an average cost of £96 for a week’s car hire excess insurance or waiver, £25 for a tyre and windscreen excess policy, £50 for an extra driver (£122 if they’re under 25 yrs), hiring a sat nav costing £75, payment for winter tyres costing £48, a roof rack (for skis) costing £34 and a child’s car seat for £51 - a grand total of £379 extra paid to the rental company.","PrivateFly offers exclusive fixed pricing on private helicopter transfers .

"An Australian woman who reached down into her tummy and tearfully delivered her baby during a caesarean has encouraged women to consider the procedure. Kylie Szabo, 27, gave birth to baby Emma in a maternal-assisted caesarean at Dandenong Hospital, Victoria on January 15. The process follows the typical caesarean procedure, performed by surgeons. The major difference being the mother, wearing sterilised gloves, plucks the baby out herself. 'It was a beautiful, healing moment - after two emergency caesareans,' said Mrs Szabo, now a mother-of-three. She told Daily Mail Australia it made the caesarean feel 'natural'. The rare procedure can bring humanity to an operation some women find dehumanising, although some obstetricians and midwives are cautious. Born, at last: Kylie Szabo welcomes her third baby, Emma, into the world after lifting her out of her sectioned belly . Wearing gloves and guided by hospital staff, Mrs Szabo welcomed Emma Szabo into the world at Dandenong Hospital, Victoria, last week . 'I can't explain it. It was wonderful'! Kylie meets baby Emma for the first time after lifting her from her belly at the end of her caesarean section . The key thing for hospital teams to consider is infection, said Associate Professor Steve Robson, the vice president of the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Different hospital follow different protocols to ensure the mother is kept sterile. Mrs Wolfe wore two pairs of gloves to keep the second pair completely sterile. Ms Szabo followed strict sterilisation procedures. She was scrubbed up, wearing gloves and unable to move her hands. 'I sort of understand very well where people say ""this is something that adds an element of risk"" and, ""does it really add anything to the procedure,' Assoc. Prof Robson said. 'Certainly some may feel its a great joy and benefit. 'How does it play out in terms of risk to the woman? Nobody really knows. I suspect it's low but I can't prove that. 'I think every other aspect (of birth) we're all so paranoid about making sure it's done as safely and minimise the risk of complications and infection. Mr Robson said he would be happy to perform the procedure, although some obstetricians are more reticent to perform the procedure. It requires the buy-in of hospital staff, including those in the operating theatre, anaesthetists and hospital policymakers. Midwifery expert professor Hannah Dahlen, from the University of Western Sydney, has seen one maternal-assisted caesarean over her long career but said several hospitals were open to performing them. 'There would be lots of obstetricians unhappy with it happening. It also is a little bit more work for the midwives and everyone. (The patient) has to make sure her hands don't touch anything.' 'Not all women want this. It's something that some women do,' ' said Prof Dahlen, who has delivered babies for more than 25 years. 'I think it certainly should be a choice.' Kylie Szabo was moved to tears after meeting baby Emma following her maternal assisted caesarean procedure . Bubba: Szabo is pictured here with her elder daughter Isbelle and her newest daughter Emma . Birth of baby Matilda: Gerri Wolfe, 41, from Umina Beach on the New South Wales Central Coast is pictured lifting her 10th child from her sectioned tummy . And now baby Violet: Mrs Wolfe then lifted her 11th child out. She told Daily Mail Australia on Thursday the twins will be her and husband Robert's last additions to the family . And women who have experienced maternal-assisted caesareans said it was a vast improvement on their previous procedures. 'My other caesareans were very sterile, very surgical, very impersonal,' Mrs Wolfe told Daily Mail Australia from her home on the Central Coast earlier this week. 'People were talking about what they did on the weekend without even thinking about me laying on the table, going through this momentous experience of having a baby.' 'This was much more personal.' Ms Szabo, who had no complications and was thrilled with the process, has no regrets about her choice. She told Daily Mail Australia it was an option women in her shoes should consider. 'I'd probably say it was the closet thing I could possibly have to delivering naturally.' 'I'd recommend anyone who'd like to try a caesarean as close as a natural birth as possible to highly consider it,' she said.","Several Australian women have had the rare procedure safely .

"Plumbers doing maintenance work accidentally started the fire which ripped through a 400-unit luxury New Jersey apartment complex and left more than 1,000 people homeless, officials have claimed. The blaze at The Avalon at Edgewater, a complex overlooking the Hudson River and across from New York City, was under control but still smoldering Thursday, more than a day after it began on the first floor. At a news conference with Governor Chris Christie, Edgewater Police Chief William Skidmore said plumbers inadvertently started the fire inside a wall. He called the cause of the fire 'totally accidental.' 'A plumbing repair ignited a fire in the wall which then spread through the building,' he said. 'It was accidental, there was nothing suspicious about it, and we have complete verification and there's no doubt about it. It was just a tragic accident.' Authorities said everyone in the four-story building—where a two-bedroom with views of Manhattan would set you back around $3,000 per month—was able to flee to safety.

State of emergency: Edgewater Mayor Michael McPartland declared a local state of emergency. He said schools would be closed on Thursday and access to roads would be restricted until further notice.

Before speaking, Christie met with town officials, including the mayor and fire and police chiefs in the auditorium of the Edgewater Community Center, where the Red Cross and others had set up tables where displaced residents could get help finding apartments, medicine and other services. 'We'll be here to help,' Christie told one woman as he took a tour shortly after. 'I'm sorry for your loss.' A GoFundMe page has not been set up for the residents who have been displaced by the fire.

Hampered by winds and frigid temperatures, firefighters battled the huge fire Wednesday night at the Avalon apartment complex, home to New York Yankees announcer John Sterling and a thousand others. The enormous fire sent flames sky high and left smoke still visible from Manhattan in the early hours of Thursday. Residents in parts of New York City could not only see the thick smoke coming from across the Hudson, but they could smell it, as well. Residents were ordered to evacuate and many were sheltered at a nearby school. As the fire continued to rage, hundreds who lived at the complex wondered what would be left of their homes. By morning, the true extent of the disaster was revealed as smoke billowed from the once gleaming complex's ashes. 'I was wondering what I was going to do for clothes,' Sterling said in an interview with the New York Daily News. 'But then I started thinking about all the stuff, all the memories, whether it be music, books, and a lot of other stuff. 'You know I was planning on moving to a new apartment complex and felt I was going to throw a lot of that stuff out. Now I hope I haven't lost it.'

It is now being sold by a classic car dealer for £25,000 . Previous owner: Former Prime Minister Harold Wilson (right) with his father, James Herbert Wilson, in front of the classic car. Its gearbox was modified to allow Mr Wilson to make a quick getaway in an emergency . Mint condition: Despite being built in the late 1960s, the car has only logged 8,000 miles. The log book, pictured, shows the British-made motor was bought by the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works in October 1967 . The British-made motor was bought by the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works in October 1967. It was then used by Mr Wilson and kept by the Government until 1978. It is thought the car might also have been used by Prime Ministers Edward Heath and James Callaghan. Despite its age, the car, which is equipped with a six-cylinder Rolls Royce engine, is in mint condition and has just 8,000 miles on the clock. Its gear box also offers a quick-launch function - a feature that was added to allow the prime minister to make a quick getaway in an emergency. On the market: The car is now being sold by James Szkiler (pictured) from his dealership in Malton, North Yorkshire, who hopes to attract classic car enthusiasts looking to add to their private collections . Customised: The four-litre vehicle was also fitted with other refinements such as folding rear picnic tables, rear safety belts, power assisted steering, a radio and wing mirrors - all costly extras in the 1960s .

Fit for a PM: Gear box was fitted with a quick-launch function, allowing Mr Wilson to make a speedy getaway . The four-litre vehicle was also fitted with other refinements such as folding rear picnic tables, rear safety belts, power assisted steering, a radio and wing mirrors. While we may not have picnic tables today, the other options are standard fittings - but back in the late 1960s would all have been costly extras. The vehicle is now being sold by Mr Szkiler's company, Classic and Sportscar Centre. When the Vanden Plas appeared for sale, its prestigious history and Huddersfield link - Mr Wilson was from the town - made it an attractive purchase. 'When I saw it advertised I jumped on it,' he said. 'We've had a few Princesses in the past but the Harold Wilson connection struck a chord. 'There's only 8,000 miles on the clock and it's only been used for the first few years. 'It was in a stunning condition when I picked it up. It's a real collector's car for any real enthusiast who wants to enter it in competitions or someone who wants it for their own private collection. 'It's superb to drive - it's powerful, smooth and comfortable. I just hope it stays in the UK.'","Black 1967 Vanden Plas Princess R was used by Mr Wilson in the 1970s .
