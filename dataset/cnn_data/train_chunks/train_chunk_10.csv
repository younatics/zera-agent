"CUYAHOGA FALLS, Ohio (CNN) -- Camryn Jakeb Wilson was bathed in TV lights the day he was born, celebrated on the local news as Summit County's 2008 New Year's baby after his arrival at 12:33 a.m. January 1. Camryn Jakeb Wilson was the first baby born this year in Summit County, Ohio, arriving at 12:33 a.m. January 1. Just 12 weeks later, he was bathed in warm water minutes after he quietly died in his mother's arms, the victim of shaken baby syndrome. Camryn's 9-year-old sister, Tabatha, asked why he needed a bath now. ""We have to get him ready to go to Jesus,"" a nurse softly replied. Tabatha took up a sponge to help. Camryn's father, Craig R. Wilson, 28, of Cuyahoga Falls, is scheduled for a pretrial hearing on murder and other charges August 20. Police say he confessed to shaking and squeezing the infant after arguing with his wife, Crystal Wilson. But he has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and faces trial in September. ""There are no excuses for this to happen to any baby,"" said Crystal Wilson, 26. ""This is murder. He had no reason to die. He died because he cried."" An innocent infant's violent death has destroyed a family.  Watch the family celebrate Camryn's birth » . ""It really is a tragedy,"" said Craig Wilson's defense attorney, Jonathan T. Sinn. ""I mean, not only did Crystal and Craig lose a son, but Crystal lost a husband, and Craig's parents lost a son and a grandson. ... One day this was a happy, perfect family, and the next day it's been devastated."" The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome estimates that as many as 1,400 babies annually are injured or killed by shaking. According to the center, 70 percent to 79 percent of people convicted of killing or hurting babies are men. The average age of perpetrators is 24, and 82 percent are either the parent of the victim or the live-in boyfriend of the mother.  Watch CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta explain shaken baby syndrome » . Craig Wilson and Crystal Twiddy, both recovering alcoholics, met about four years ago in a softball league popular with Alcoholics Anonymous members. The couple beamed in engagement photos shot in a garden setting before they were married in September. It was the first marriage for both.  See photos of the family » . Craig, the machinist son of the Cuyahoga Falls High School wrestling coach and a former Mat Cats wrestler himself, became a father figure to Tabatha, Crystal's daughter from a previous relationship. The newlyweds also became frequent caretakers to 1-year-old Corrine, a daughter Craig had with another woman. Family members said the couple's only source of conflict was Craig's interaction with Corrine's mother. On March 12, the topic sparked a heated quarrel, according to a police report and family accounts. The couple hurled their wedding rings, along with profane insults, at each other. Crystal left with Tabatha to attend one of her regular AA meetings, leaving baby Camryn in the care of his father. ""Maybe they both could have used a meeting that night,"" Sinn observed. When Crystal and Tabatha got home from the meeting March 12, Crystal immediately noticed that Camryn didn't look right in his baby swing. He was gasping for air but couldn't be wakened. After briefly speaking with an on-call doctor at Akron Children's Hospital, she scooped him up and rushed him there. Camryn was critically injured, with bleeding inside his head and in the backs of his eyes, and several broken ribs -- some of which, according to the autopsy, turned out to be older injuries. Medical personnel at the hospital determined that the combination of injuries could only mean abuse. When rib fractures are seen in a 10-week-old infant, ""it's beating up,"" said Dr. Nicolas Krawiecki, a pediatric neurologist and faculty member at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. He is not involved in the Wilson case.  Watch a doctor describe typical symptoms » . Craig Wilson was summoned to the hospital, where police questioned both parents separately. Early on March 13, the 5-foot-7-inch, 190-pound father was arrested after admitting that he had shaken and squeezed his baby out of frustration and anger toward his wife resulting from the argument over Corrine's mother, according to the police investigators' report. The bleeding inside Camryn's head was catastrophic. The two sides of his brain were ""like two telephone poles with the lines between them cut,"" a family member said a doctor told them. Camryn was blind and incapable of feeling someone touching him, he could not breathe on his own, and if he lived, he would never be aware of his surroundings or even be capable of thinking, family members said.  Learn about shaken baby syndrome » . After almost two weeks of waiting for a miracle that would never come, Crystal Wilson decided to withdraw life support. She gave friends and family -- including everyone on Craig's side -- time to gather to say goodbye to the tiny boy with the big, sightless eyes. Various relatives took turns holding him as he gradually slipped away. ""They pulled together; they prayed together; they took baby Camryn off life support together,"" said Sinn, the Wilson family's longtime lawyer. ""And that was a wonderful thing, that they were able to pull together like that despite Craig being alleged to have done these things."" Camryn's father was not among them as he remained in jail. Sheriff's deputies took Craig Wilson to the funeral home for a brief private viewing of the infant's body the night before the funeral. But the family unity would not last. Buried with Camryn were multiple relationships that could not survive the grief, recrimination and legal machinations that have followed his death.  Watch how Camryn's death has ruined relationships » . Crystal Wilson intends to divorce her husband of 11 months and is at odds with her in-laws. ""My anger is kicked in full load,"" she wrote on her private MySpace page. ""I don't care what Craig's family members think. He did this to my son. May he get what he deserves! Maybe people should talk more about Camryn than Craig. Craig's name has no worth to even be mentioned."" Through their attorney, Wilson and his family declined to comment to CNN. Sinn said the autopsy on Camryn raises questions about whether Craig Wilson or someone else might have injured the infant on previous occasions. The autopsy report, obtained by CNN, found Camryn had multiple rib fractures, including several that apparently were incurred on one or more previous occasions. ""The question becomes: If that autopsy is accurate, if this child has been severely injured to the point that his ribs were fractured on prior occasions, multiple occasions, how come no one knew that?"" Sinn said. If Camryn's caregivers didn't pick up on his earlier rib fractures, neither did medical personnel trained to look for signs of child abuse. Camryn had been to Children's Hospital several times during his short life -- including earlier on the day he was fatally injured -- for well-baby checks and immunizations. No doctor or nurse ever noted broken ribs or signs of unusual pain in the infant, family members said.  Watch how to avoid hurting a baby » . Cuyahoga Falls police have said there are no suspects besides Craig Wilson, and Summit County Children Services removes children immediately from a home investigators consider dangerous. Crystal Wilson's other child, 9-year-old Tabatha, is still at home with her mother. Sinn conceded that his client belatedly admitted to police having squeezed Camryn on previous occasions. ""He only made the confession after the detectives involved started talking about other possibilities of how this child could have been injured, what other folks in the household could have injured him. Then Craig quickly took responsibility,"" Sinn said. Sinn said his client would accept ""today"" an offer to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter, saying Craig Wilson had no intention to kill Camryn that night, making a murder charge inappropriate. But prosecutors say there will be no deal. ""No matter what happens, Craig is going to very likely spend the majority of his adult life in prison,"" Sinn conceded. ""We are talking massive numbers here."" John Saros, executive director of Summit County Children Services, said crime within a family can bring long-lasting hardship, especially when a family member goes to prison. ""If that's the breadwinner or the main breadwinner, then you've got some serious financial problems right off the bat,"" he said. Crystal and Tabatha can attest to that. They can no longer afford to live in the charming little house they once shared with Craig on a peaceful Cuyahoga Falls street.  Watch how bad things happen in good families » . ""I lost my job because of this, because I couldn't work enough hours. Now I have to move into a smaller place,"" Crystal said. ""It's horrible. It's a whole life change."" And the consequences in such circumstances extend beyond the immediate family, Saros said. ""It will be the basis for divorces; it'll be the basis for the kind of family conflict that then brings into play maternal and paternal grandparents and the extended family on both sides, and we end up with a lot of conflict,"" said Saros, who has been in the family services field for 40 years. Crystal Wilson's mother -- Camryn's grandmother, Laura Twiddy -- is angry at Craig but is trying to keep perspective. ""I can't have HATE eat me up and beat me down. I can't live like that,"" she wrote on her MySpace page. ""I will have to one day forgive him so that I might find peace."" Peace of a sort can be found near the back of Stow Cemetery, where birds chirp in the trees above a freshly carved marker bearing a photograph of a big-eyed baby boy. The plot where Camryn now lies beneath that stone was donated to Crystal Wilson by a kind relative: Janet Wilson, Camryn's great-grandmother.

"(OPRAH.com) -- The recession has millions of consumers spending less, saving more and paying off debt. The fact that we are adjusting to the reality of this economy is good news, to be sure. There are items in any budget that can be scaled back easily. Financial expert Jean Chatzky warns there are items you should not cut out of your budget. But there's some spending areas where you shouldn't budge. Retirement planning . The Pension Rights Center counted about 20 corporations in December that announced changes to their 401(k) plans. Many others have discontinued or downsized their traditional pension plans. If your company is still offering matching dollars, you should keep kicking in money to grab them. ""To get that free money from your employer is so important for the long-term growth of your retirement nest egg. Especially now, with the down market, when you're dollar-cost averaging in at lower prices, that free money has more value in the long run,"" said Derek Kennedy, a financial planner in Cincinnati. If your company has cut back, it still pays to contribute. Also consider an Individual Retirement Account. You can get your money out any time and, after five years, use it without penalty for a first-time home purchase. Insurance . Don't cut your homeowners insurance thinking that because home values have dropped you don't need as much coverage. What you're paying for is the amount it would cost to rebuild your home and replace your belongings. If you need to save, boost your policy's deductible. Raising it to $1,000 from $500 could shave 25 percent off the cost. Exercise . Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota just completed a study that found that people who go to the gym at least eight times a month have significantly lower health costs than those who don't. You can get those same benefits by going for a brisk walk, running or riding a bike or by spending less than the cost of a monthly gym membership on a pair of dumbbells. Healthcare . Some cuts are fine -- generic drugs instead of name brand, for instance. But skipping doctor visits is a bad idea, and so is canceling your insurance. ""I've seen so many people go through horrendous financial nightmares and even bankruptcy because they don't have health insurance. This is just not one you want to mess with,"" said Jonni McCoy, author of ""Miserly Moms: Living Well on Less in a Tough Economy."" Charity . Giving to others can make you feel better about yourself and your situation. If money is tight, donate items you no longer use, give canned goods, shop at thrift stores that benefit a charity or share some of your time. Oprah.com: Five steps to secure your financial future .

"(AOL Autos) -- The conventional wisdom, among most folks, anyway, is that buying a used car is usually something done out of necessity, by those on a budget -- that is, people who want, or need, to ""move down"" from the new-car market because a new model is simply out of their reach. Bottom line, the Lexus reputation is for high-end luxury, quality and long-term dependability. However, there is another category of used cars that appeal to those with a bit more disposable income: used luxury cars. For some buyers, the used-luxury market is a way of getting into that Lexus, Lincoln, Infiniti or Porsche you always wanted, without laying out $70,000 or $80,000 for something you're not actually going to live in. For others, scouring the used-luxury-car listings is a way of re-visiting the halcyon years of their youth. At this point, some of these used-luxe models have been around so long that they almost qualify as vintage throwback editions. Recently, Consumer Reports magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars, and divvied them up by price range. Using CR's recommendations as a guideline, here is a list of some of the best used luxury cars currently on the market in the $24,000-30,000 price range. 2005 & 2006 Acura MDX . A luxury SUV, the MDX is spacious, seats seven, and boasts distinctive styling and Acura's famed attention to detail. Plus, it packs some punch under the hood -- this generation was powered by 3.5-liter, 253-hp V6 matched to a five-speed automatic transmission. AOL Autos: Used Acura . Priced just right as a new vehicle, it included safety features like dual-stage front airbags, three-point seatbelts and adjustable head restraints for all seating positions. 2007 Acura RDX . A crossover vehicle that mixes sedan-like ride with SUV roominess, the '07 RDX offered unibody construction, leather upholstery, heated front seats, power moonroof, 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, xenon HID headlights with foglamps and the 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine -- plus a five-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters on the steering wheel, and the patented SH-AWD (SH for Super Handling) system. 2006 & 2007 Acura TL . A mid-size, front-wheel-drive, four-door sedan powered by a 258-hp 3.2-liter V6, the Acura TL is a fine road machine. Actually, it was available for '06-'07 as both a TL and a higher-end TL Type S -- the latter of which sported an upgraded engine, a 286-hp 3.5-liter. Depending on trim level, you can find it with a five-speed automatic with a console-mounted lever or shift paddles on the steering wheel. 2007 Audi A3 . Audi designers have always shown a certain flair for dynamics, and that is evident here, in a sharply-engineered, handsomely-appointed vehicle that offers a fine balance between silky ride, nimble handling and zesty performance. This sporty compact was powered by a 200-hp 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine in '07, and came standard with a six-speed manual and an optional Direct Shift Gearbox. AOL Autos: Used Audi . 2005 & 2006 BMW 3-Series . The 3-Series is another winning stable of cars, but Consumer Reports especially liked specific model years/versions/features in the 3-Series family: The 2005 RWD coupe and convertible; the '06 325i RWD sedan; the '06 330i RWD sedan and the '05 Z4. Depending on the model year and version, the standard engine ranged from a 184-hp 2.5-L to a 255-hp 3.0-L. AOL Autos: Used BMW . 2005 & 2006 Infiniti FX35 . Another of the many crossovers that have hit the market the last several years, the FX35 is one of the sportier editions. During these model years, the FX35 2WD came with a 280-hp 3.5-liter V6 and a five-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel-drive was standard, but AWD was also an option. Some spiffier features included leather seating surfaces, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone climate control with microfiltration and steering-wheel controls. AOL Autos: Used Infiniti . Infiniti G35 . The G35 is one of the more svelte sports-sedan beauties on the road, offering Infiniti's typical attention to detail and sporting attitude. Yes, it has four doors, but it handles like a sporty coupe, with its power coming from a finely-tuned 3.5-liter V6. Horsepower output is 280 for the automatic and 298 with the manual. Luxo amenities include leather upholstery, automatic climate control, steering wheel audio controls, illuminated visor vanity mirrors and high-intensity discharge (HID) xenon headlamps. Lexus . Any luxury-car aficionado knows that a Lexus is one of the most exquisitely-designed, high-performing chariots on the luxury-car market, and CR saw fit to include more than a half-dozen Lexus models on this list of recommended used luxury cars -- from the '02 SC and LX models, to the '03-'04 GX edition, '03 LS, '04 / '06 IS entries, '04-'05 RX model, '05 GS and '06 ES to ... well, you get the picture. Bottom line, given the Lexus reputation for high-end luxury, quality and long-term dependability, it's hard to go wrong with any of the above-named Lexus entries. And all have plenty of engine oomph and luxo-line amenities. AOL Autos: Used Lexus . 2007 Lincoln MKX . This luxury crossover vehicle debuted in '07 as a replacement for the Aviator, and made a big splash. A higher-end and pricier version of the Ford Edge, it seats five and is powered by a 265 hp 3.5-liter V-6 and comes with standard six-speed automatic tranny. Either FWD or AWD is available. One cool option was the glass-paneled roof dubbed the ""Vista Roof."" 2007 Lincoln MKZ . Also new for the '07 model year, this handsome and fully-loaded mid-size luxury sedan replaced the Zephyr. Under the hood purrs a muscular 263-hp V6 hitched to a six-speed automatic transmission. FWD is standard, but AWD is optional. Standard safety features include side-impact air bags in the front; curtain-style head protection airbags for all outboard positions; plus traction control and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution. 2007 Lincoln Town Car . A venerated luxury car whose heritage goes way back, the Town Car still ""has game"" -- and is a far cry from the floaty boats your granddad drove in the '70s and '80s. It's still cavernous inside, but now boasts a much more refined design. It seats six comfortably and is powered by a 239-hp 4.6-liter V-8 that's linked to a four-speed automatic. The well-appointed cabin is trimmed in premium leather and burl walnut appliques. Available in Signature, Signature Limited, Designer and Signature L trim levels, you can find one to fit any taste. 1998 Porsche 911 . No, your eyes don't deceive you -- CR did include a primo, high-line vehicle like a Porsche 911 on its list of recommended used cars under $30,000. But, take note: This is the 1998 edition. But when you're dealing with quality of this level, even an 10-year-old vehicle has a lot of juice left in it. So, by ""going vintage,"" driving enthusiasts can get into their car of their dreams without breaking the bank. In '98, the 911 was powered by a 3.6L H-6 282 hp engine. So, while it wasn't quite the road-burner it is today, is still packed plenty of thrust. 2007 Volvo S60 (FWD) Only a year old, the '07 used edition should still be in fine condition, and it boasts top-drawer performance, stylish design and Volvo's all-world safety features. The '07 S60 came in several trim levels, with an array of engine sizes, from the turbocharged 2.5-liter 208 hp job to the 2.3-liter 257-hp inline five-cylinder plant to the 2.5-liter high-pressure turbocharged and intercooled engine that churned out 300 ponies. Depending on the trim line, either a manual or automatic transmission can be had. 2006 & 2007 Volvo XC70 . The XC70 is a crossover vehicle, splitting the difference between an SUV and a wagon. And it's one of the finest crossovers on the road. It's all-wheel drive, and the latest used-model-year, the '07, was powered by a 208-hp turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder engine matched to a Geartronic five-speed automatic transmission that also offers manual gear selection.","Some buyers go to used-car market to get the luxury car they always wanted .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israel's attorney general will indict former President Moshe Katsav on charges of rape and sexual assault of a number of his employees, the country's justice ministry said Sunday. Israel's ex-President Moshe Katsav will face rape and sexual assault charges, Israel's Justice Ministry said. Katsav will also be charged with obstruction of justice, Attorney General Menachem Mazuz said in a statement. Katsav had agreed in 2007 to plead guilty to lesser charges and pay a fine in order to avoid jail time, but pulled out of the deal when it came time to enter his plea. The plea bargain caused a public storm in Israel, mainly because it did not include charges of rape, contrary to what had been suggested by Mazuz in a draft indictment.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iranian conservatives have said they captured most of the 82 parliamentary seats up for grabs in Friday's runoff election. An Iranian girl drops her mother's ballot for the parliamentary runoff election. Conservatives took about 80 percent of the parliamentary seats, official Mohammad Forouzandeh told the country's semi-official FARS news agency. ""The final results are not in yet, but so far, the fundamentalists have 53 seats, Reformists have 12 and the rest went to Independent candidates with fundamentalist tendencies,"" he said. FARS also published the names of the 11 winners of the Tehran constituency. Ten were conservatives and one was a reformist. Iran's official news agency, IRNA, reported that election results from 47 out of 54 had been finalized, and that the final count would be ready Saturday night. IRNA said voter participation in the second round was 8 percent higher than the second round of the previous election. Last month's first round, in which 204 parliamentary races were settled, was a decisive victory for the hard-line conservatives. The reformists suffered a setback before the March election, when 70 percent of their candidates were disqualified. Iran's conservative Guardian Council screened candidates and disqualified about 1,700 it deemed unsuitable. They were predominantly reformists. The Guardian Council is an unelected body of six high clerics appointed by supreme religious leaders and six lawyers nominated by the head of the judiciary branch.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A top congressional Republican on Sunday criticized President Barack Obama's expected decision to reverse the Bush administration's limits on embryonic stem-cell research, calling it a distraction from the country's economic slump. U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor also says the policy reversal could lead to embryo harvesting, which ""shouldn't be done."" ""Why are we going and distracting ourselves from the economy? This is job No. 1. Let's focus on what needs to be done,"" Rep. Eric Cantor, the Republican whip in the House of Representatives, told CNN's ""State of the Union."" Obama's move, scheduled for Monday morning, is part of a broader effort to separate science and politics and ""restore scientific integrity in governmental decision-making,"" White House domestic policy adviser Melody Barnes said Sunday. The Bush administration's 2001 policy bars federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells beyond the cell lines that existed at the time. Cantor, R-Virginia, has been among the leaders of GOP opposition to Obama's economic policies. In a conference call with reporters, Barnes said funding research is also part of the administration's plan to boost the plunging U.S. economy. ""Advances with regard to science and technology help advance our overall national goals around economic growth and job creation,"" she said, adding, ""I think anytime you make an effort to try and separate these pieces of the puzzle, you're missing the entire picture."" Because stem cells have the potential to turn into any organ or tissue cell in the body, research advocates say they could yield cures to debilitating conditions such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease and spinal injuries. But because work on embryonic stem cells involves the destruction of human embryos, many conservatives supported the limits former President George Bush imposed by executive order in 2001. ""Frankly, federal funding of embryonic stem-cell research can bring on embryo harvesting, perhaps even human cloning that occurs,"" Cantor said. ""We don't want that. That shouldn't be done. That's wrong."" The Bush policy limited federal funding to work on 60 existing stem-cell lines, but only 21 of those have proven useful to researchers. Congress voted to roll back those limits in 2006 and 2007, but Bush vetoed the legislation both times, leading to Democratic charges that he had put politics over science. Dr. Harold Varmus, president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and co-chairman of Obama's science advisory council, said Sunday that Obama will ""endorse the notion that public policy must be guided by sound, scientific advice."" Obama's order will direct the National Institutes of Health to develop revised guidelines on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research within 120 days, said Varmus, who joined Barnes in the conference call with reporters. ""The president is, in effect, allowing federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research to the extent that it's permitted by law -- that is, work with stem cells themselves, not the derivation of stem cells,"" he said. Supporters of the ban said researchers could still obtain private funding or explore alternatives such as adult stem cells. Opponents said the research could be carried out using embryos left over in fertility clinics, which otherwise would be discarded. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, told reporters that reversing the Bush ban would ""once again say to the rest of the world that we will be the beacon for cures and for hope."" She credited her support for federal funding in part for her 2006 election. ""I think it's a great moment, and I'm proud of [Obama] for reversing that executive order,"" McCaskill said. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, said the Bush policy imposed ethical limits on science. ""My basic tenet here is I don't think we should create life to enhance life and to do research and so forth,"" Shelby said. ""I know that people argue there are other ways. I think we should continue our biomedical research everywhere we can, but we should have some ethics about it.""

"KARACHI, Pakistan (CNN) -- Police in Pakistan arrested lawyers holding a public protest to demand that the government immediately restore judges the previous president had ousted, Karachi's police chief told CNN Thursday. Lawyers shout slogans Thursday in Karachi on the eve of a march to Islamabad. Among those detained were Muira Malik, former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association and leader of the Karachi lawyers movement, and retired high court justice Rasheed Razvi, police Chief Wasim Ahmed said. The lawyers were arrested under an order that outlaws public gatherings. The police chief also said authorities had credible information that there was a terror threat against the march and he had warned the lawyers before they started that it would be a public danger. Up to 500 lawyers in the Karachi group planned to join thousands of other demonstrators heading to the capital, Islamabad, as part of a four-day ""Long March."" The demonstrators plan a massive sit-in at the parliament building Monday. ""Our movement is a peaceful movement,"" organizer Razvi, president of the Sindh High Court Bar Association, said before his arrest. ""When we protested the last time, there were hundreds of thousands of people and not one grass was broken, not one leaf was broken."" The demonstrators began walking from the gates of the Sindh High Court, heading to a dozen buses that waited to ferry them to their next stop: the city of Hyderabad. ""The rule of baton and bullets cannot last,"" the protesters chanted. They want President Asif Ali Zardari to live up to a promise to reinstate judges sacked by then-President Pervez Musharraf. Among the dismissed judges was the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. After sweeping into power in parliamentary elections last year, Zardari's Pakistan Peoples Party promised to reinstate the judges within 30 days of taking office. The deadline came and went. The government responded to the recent intensification of protests by banning political demonstrations in two of the country's biggest provinces -- Punjab and Sindh. It also detained several hundred activists Wednesday. But the protesters said they will not be deterred. Their movement now, they said, isn't so much about reinstating Chaudhry as it is about restoring the office of the chief justice. ""We will start the long march from the province as we have promised the nation,"" Razvi said. The country's largest opposition party, the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N), is backing the lawyers -- but for reasons of its own. Party head Nawaz Sharif accuses Zardari of being behind a February Supreme Court decision that bars Sharif from holding public office. The court also stripped Sharif's brother, Shahbaz, of his post as chief minister of Punjab -- the Sharif party's power center. Supporters of PML-N have responded by holding massive rallies, some of which have turned violent in recent days.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Spain remain top of the world rankings for the ninth straight month, according to newly released standings by FIFA, the world game's governing body. European champions Spain are ranked No.1 by FIFA in their world rankings. The European champions have not lost a game since going down 1-0 in a friendly to Romania in Cadiz in November 2006. They top their 2010 World Cup qualifying group, with four wins from four games, and have only conceded one goal in their last 10 internationals. No team can compete with that record and Spain are placed at No.1 for that reason. Their rankings are based on team performances over the last four years, with more recent results and more significant matches being more heavily weighted to help reflect the current competitive state of a team. Yet fans all over the world have long questioned how much can be read into the rankings. After the 2008 African Cup of Nations, US-based football columnist Ives Galarcep wrote: ""Don't try making any sense of these rankings. After all, Egypt, which just won the African Cup of Nations for a second straight time, is ranked 29th, fourth best among African teams."" Do you think FIFA's rankings count for much? Let us know in the Sound Off box below. For example, France, who reached the World Cup final in 2006 are down in 12th, while England, who failed to even qualify for Euro 2008, are ninth. Furthermore, Les Bleus were at their lowest-ever standing in the rankings in April 1998, when they were down in 25th. Three months later, they lifted the World Cup. From 2001-06, Mexico were anchored in the top 10, at one point as high as fourth, which left many European fans wondering how that was possible. They were ahead of many a supposed European powerhouse, such as Portugal. Not only did the Iberian country reach the final of Euro 2004, they also made the semi-finals of the World Cup in Germany two years later. Mexico were even in the same group as Portugal at the World Cup and finished five points behind them in second place. In the round of 16 Mexico fell to skilful but flawed Argentina side. Surely the yardstick is the planet's biggest tournament? There is luck involved, of course, as it's knockout football, but the best teams overall tend to go through. FIFA's suggestion that Mexico were once the fourth-best team in the world does not seem to add up. And to suggest that throughout this period they were better than Portugal does not ring true -- not when performances on the pitch indicate otherwise. Other ranking systems, compiled by football statisticians, have been founded as an alternative to FIFA's, which began in 1993. Criticism that calculating rankings over an eight-year period was unrepresentative of a team's recent performances led to FIFA revamping their system after the last World Cup. ""The increasingly high profile of the world ranking has also brought a certain amount of criticism that its calculation formula is too complicated. It was therefore decided in 2005 to revise the ranking in order to simplify the way in which it is calculated,"" according to FIFA.com. Before that there were even more glaring anomalies than today: Norway were twice ranked second in the table in the 1990s and the United States were fourth two months before the World Cup in 2006. At the tournament, the Americans went home early after picking up one point and two goals in their three group games, which made a mockery of such a high placing. As of March 2009, Brazil and Argentina are the only non-European teams in the top 10, Cameroon (16) are the highest African nation, the United States are 17th, while Australia are the top Asian nation at 32. But regardless of your opinions of the rankings, they are here to stay. And Spain deserve respect for becoming only the sixth team after Germany, Brazil, Italy, France and Argentina to top them.","Spain remain top of FIFA's world rankings for the ninth month in a row .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Football fans are set to benefit from the recession as clubs slash season ticket prices to keep supporters coming back. Some Premier League fans will save on season tickets after five clubs cut prices. Price cuts have been announced at five English Premier League clubs. Manchester City, Sunderland, Everton, Portsmouth and Newcastle United have cut prices, while five further clubs announced price freezes on their season tickets. Bolton dropped their season ticket prices last season. Manchester City have taken an average of seven percent off their prices, while at Everton the cheapest adult season ticket will now be £399 ($550). At Sunderland under-16 season passes will be just £1($1.39) per home match for the 19 matches (£19 [$26] total) when purchased with an adult pass. The move comes amid a slight decline in Premiership football crowds this season. The average attendance at Premier League matches is down about 800 per match compared to the 2007/2008 season -- however, on average the stadiums are still at almost 92 percent capacity. Outside the United Kingdom, fans also stand to benefit from lower ticket prices. In the U.S. Major League Soccer side Kansas City Wizards recently announced they would drop ticket prices for the coming season. Wizards president Robb Heinemann was quoted in the Kansas City Star saying; ""We understand these are tough economic times."" Other countries in Europe have maintained lower prices in recent years, with single tickets available for about 10 Euros in club games in Italy and Germany. Tickets in Australia's A-League tended to be cheaper yet, while South America and Africa/Middle East remained the cheapest. In England's League One and League Two competitions crowds had dropped more significantly. Dan Johnson of the Premier League told CNN the clubs cutting ticket prices were simply responding to the financial climate. ""Given the economic situation, there will be pressure on fans' ability to spend and the clubs have acted accordingly. ""It's a very real way that they can help at this time,"" Johnson said. Johnson said the drop in crowds this season was not significant and may be made up towards the end of the season when attendances are traditionally higher. Sport business expert Professor Simon Chadwick, founder of the Center for the International Business of Sport (CIBS) at Coventry University, told CNN recessions could have a strong impact on football crowds. ""In previous recessions there is evidence to suggest that as unemployment rises, the attendance at football matches decreases,"" he said. However, Chadwick said English football fans shouldn't hope for significant price reductions. ""Some Premier League clubs are running at nearly 100% capacity and there's excess demand ...so in the short-to-medium term they should be able to continue at premium prices,"" Chadwick said.","Football fans to benefit as club teams lower season ticket prices .

"(CNN) -- Rioting has flared near Belfast on Saturday after the arrests of three men in the killings of two soldiers in Northern Ireland last week, police said. Two people in masks prepare to throw petrol bombs Saturday in Lurgan, Northern Ireland. Petrol bombs have been hurled at police in Lurgan, a town in County Armagh, 20 miles west of Belfast, police in Northern Ireland said. There are gangs of youths on the streets, authorities said, but there have been no arrests or injuries. Police announced the arrests on Saturday and said the three men have been taken to the police service's Serious Crime Suite in County Antrim. One of them, a dissident republican named Colin Duffy, is from Lurgan. They are the first arrests in connection with the March 7 shootings, which were the first fatal attack on British troops in the province for more than 12 years. The two British soldiers were shot dead at a base in Massereene, in Antrim, as they were preparing to ship out for duty in Afghanistan. The soldiers, Cengiz ""Pat"" Azimkar, 21, and Mark Quinsey, 23, had already packed their bags and changed into desert uniforms, authorities said. Two masked gunmen with automatic rifles shot them as the soldiers picked up a pizza delivery at the barracks, authorities said. Two other soldiers and the two pizza delivery men were seriously wounded. The shooting has sparked fears of a return to the sectarian violence that Northern Ireland suffered until the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, a period known as The Troubles. A militant splinter group, the Real IRA, reportedly claimed it had carried out the attack on the soldiers. Two days after the soldiers were killed, a police officer was killed in a shooting southwest of Belfast. Constable Stephen Carroll was one of four officers who were responding to call in Craigavon when his vehicle came under fire and he was killed. Three people have been arrested in connection with the police officer's death. The Continuity IRA, a republican splinter group that does not accept the Good Friday Agreement, said it had killed Carroll, Britain's Press Association reported. Politicians from across the political spectrum have condemned the killings, with Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness calling the killers ""traitors to the island of Ireland."" Sinn Fein is a predominantly Catholic party that wants Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and become part of the Republic of Ireland. The party is widely thought to be linked to the Irish Republican Army. Danny Kennedy, deputy leader of the loyalist Ulster Unionist Party, which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, also condemned the attack as ""wicked and murderous.""","NEW: Petrol bombs hurled at police after arrests in connection with soldiers' killings .

"(CNN) -- The average cost of medical care for a premature or low birth-weight baby for its first year of life is about $49,000, according to a new report from the March of Dimes Foundation. Babies born after the 37th week of pregnancy are less costly to the health care system than premature babies. By contrast, a newborn without complications costs $4,551 for care in its first year of life, the report said. Newborns with other kinds of complications, such as congenital defects, have medical expenses of $10,273 on average in the first year. The foundation wants to show employers the importance of good maternity care, maternity coverage, and prevention of prematurity, said Jennifer Howse, president of the March of Dimes, a nonprofit for pregnancy and baby health. ""It's in the best interest of the bottom line for the employer, and of course it's certainly in the best interest for the baby, the employee, and ultimately the community in which the business is located,"" she said. Although most of these costs go straight to the health care plans, even out-of-pocket expenses are far greater for premature babies than for children delivered at a normal time. The average out-of-pocket expense for a premature or low-birth-weight baby in the first year was $1,987. For uncomplicated births, it is $654, and a baby with other kinds of complications averages $953 in out of pocket expenses. But it's important to note that these are average costs for premature babies born at different times -- a baby born closer to 40 weeks will most likely cost much less than a baby born at 26 weeks, said William Sexson, neonatologist at Emory University and prematurity prevention chair for the March of Dimes for the state of Georgia. Sexson was not involved in the new report. The problem of prematurity . By definition, a premature baby is born before the 37th week of pregnancy. About 12 percent of all pregnancies in the United States result in premature birth, according to the National Institutes of Health. A low-birth-weight baby weighs less than 2,500 grams, or 5.5 pounds. Prematurity may contribute to problems such as cerebral palsy, vision problems, learning disabilities, and developmental delays, experts say. The rate of premature babies in the United States has increased 36 percent since the early 1980s, the March of Dimes said. One reason for the abundance of premature births may be the increasing number of elective early deliveries, said Sexson. There is a lack of transparency about both patients' and obstetricians' decisions to, for example, have a Caesarean section close to term -- technically premature. The March of Dimes recommends every elective delivery before 39 weeks be reviewed. ""There is a real concern that many of those deliveries are a lot more elective than they ought to be,"" Sexson said. Uncomplicated Caesarean deliveries cost over 40 percent more than uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, the new report said. These deliveries also resulted in longer inpatient stays, outpatient visits, and more prescriptions filled. Most of the costs get covered by a health plan -- out-of-pocket expenses were similar for normal Caesarian deliveries, uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, and complicated births. Preventing premature births . Prenatal care is essential in helping mothers carry their babies to term, experts say. The vitamin folate is especially important for mothers-to-be because it has been shown to prevent congenital abnormalities, said Janet Larson, chief of neonatology at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Premature babies cost the United States at least $26 billion each year, according to the Institute of Medicine. Women who have a shortened cervix, or have certain infections, such as bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis, are at higher risk for having a premature baby, according to the NIH. A history of giving birth to premature babies is also a risk factor, said Dr. Charles Macri, obstetrician-gynecologist at the The George Washington University Hospital in Washington. A woman in this situation may take progesterone therapy between weeks 16 and 36 to decrease the likelihood of a premature delivery. A pregnant woman should always tell her doctor if she has had any kind of cervical surgery, which may also contribute to premature births, he said. Women who carry multiples babies at once, even twins, are also at higher risk of giving birth prematurely, he said. Not all premature births can be prevented, however. Some babies are ""destined to be born early,"" Macri said. About 50 percent of pregnancies that result in premature births are completely normal until labor, Sexson said. Costs for premature and low-birth-weight babies are also higher in terms of combined medical costs for the mother and child -- $64,713, compared with $15,047 for uncomplicated births, the March of Dimes report said. Even in tough economic times, experts agree that pregnant women should not cut back on health care. ""Investing in health care costs -- that's the best investment a family can make,"" Howse said.","By definition, a premature baby is born before the 37th week of pregnancy .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution Friday that would have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe's longtime president, Robert Mugabe, and 11 senior members of his government. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe meets this week with Arthur Mutambara, an opposition leader. According to a draft of the resolution, the measure would have instituted a travel ban on Mugabe and others in his government, frozen many of their assets and imposed an international arms embargo on the regime. The measure received nine votes -- the minimum for it to pass. However, two of the five negative votes were from Russia and China, who as permanent members of the Security Council have veto power. One Security Council member abstained. The resolution was pushed by the United States after Mugabe ignored the Security Council's appeal to postpone the June 27 presidential runoff election. The vote initially was intended to be a runoff between Mugabe and opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai. But Tsvangirai withdrew days before, saying Mugabe's supporters had orchestrated a campaign of beatings, intimidation and murders against his supporters. With their votes, ambassadors for China and Russia said they wanted to give the rival political parties a chance to resolve the election matter on their own terms without undue interference from the Security Council. Representatives from Mugabe's party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), have been meeting in Pretoria, South Africa, with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change this week. Tsvangirai said Wednesday the talks, which are being mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki, are focusing on ""how to move forward."" Chinese Ambassador Wang Guangya said his nation believes the international community should allow the talks in South Africa on the Zimbabwe situation a chance to progress before imposing sanctions. Wang said the adoption of the resolution would ""unavoidably interfere with the negotiation process and lead to the further deterioration of the situation."" ""Many countries, including China, repeatedly called upon the Security Council to respect the position of the African countries on this question and give more time,"" Wang said. ""China has always maintained the best approach to solve a problem is negotiation and dialogue,"" Wang said. ""To use or threaten to use sanctions lightly is not conducive to solving the problem."" Wang's comments echoed those of Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin, who said the Security Council would have overstepped its responsibilities had it approved the resolution. ""Recently, in the positions of a number of council member states, we have seen an ever-more-obvious attempt to take the council beyond its chartered prerogatives and beyond maintaining international peace and security,"" Churkin said. ""We believe such practices to be illegitimate and dangerous, leading to a realignment of the entire U.N. system."" Churkin also noted that, had the resolution been approved, council members would have ignored appeals from the African Union to let the South African talks take place. He also accused the council of missing an opportunity to coordinate a response that would have ""promoted the success of the political dialogue"" in Zimbabwe. Speaking before the vote, Zimbabwean Ambassador Boniface Chidyausiku said his nation has been a victim of ""incessant meddling"" from the international community. Chidyausiku blamed sanctions already imposed on Zimbabwe for its underperforming economy and the suffering of its people. South African Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo also urged the Security Council to give the South African talks a chance to bring about a resolution. U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said the United States was disappointed at the veto. ""China and Russia have stood with Mugabe against the people of Zimbabwe ... for reasons that we think are not borne out by the facts on the ground,"" he said. ""The U-turn on the Russian position is particularly surprising and disturbing,"" he said, noting that a few days ago, the Russian Federation was supportive of a statement adopted at the Group of Eight meeting in Japan expressing ""grave concern"" about the situation in Zimbabwe. ""The Russian performance here today raises questions about its reliability as a G-8 partner,"" Khalilzad said. The draft resolution expressed ""deep concern at the gross irregularities"" during the presidential election, saying violence and intimidation before the runoff prevented ""free and fair elections,"" creating ""an environment that did not permit international election observers to operate freely before the June 27 vote."" The United Kingdom, which has been highly critical of Mugabe, was a chief supporter of the United States push for sanctions. France also supported the resolution. ""The Security Council has failed to shoulder its responsibility to do what it can to prevent a national tragedy deepening and spreading its effects across southern Africa,"" British Ambassador John Sawers said after the vote.  Watch the British Ambassador to the U.N. speaks about the failed resolution » . Sawers also questioned Mbeki's efficacy as a mediator in Zimbabwe's affairs. ""We have to be realistic. Those efforts have so far come to naught. The only one who has benefited to date is Mr. Mugabe,"" he said. After the vote, Chidyausiku thanked the council for heeding his call. ""Today we have seen reason,"" he said. ""I want to express our gratitude to the people in the Security Council who managed to see reason and refused to be intimidated or cowed into following the national interests of the U.S. and UK."" The Zimbabwean people, he said, are ""committed to resolve their differences.""

"ST. POELTEN, Austria (CNN)  -- A verdict in the case of Josef Fritzl, the Austrian man accused of keeping his daughter in a cellar for decades and fathering her seven children, could come as early as Thursday, a court official told reporters Monday. Josef Fritzl expects to spend the rest of his life in prison, his attorney has said. As his trial began behind closed doors Monday Fritzl pleaded guilty to incest and other charges, but denied charges of murder and enslavement -- the most serious charges against him. He pleaded ""Partly guilty"" to multiple charges of rape, but did not elaborate. ""Partly guilty"" is a plea option in Austrian courts. Franz Cutka, a spokesman for the Landesgericht St. Poelten court, said the ""partly guilty"" plea might mean that Fritzl contends he is not guilty of all the individual rape charges or that the violence used was not as severe as rape. Cutka was not in court for the plea and does not speak for the defendant. Fritzl's attorney was not immediately available to explain what he meant. Fritzl arrived at the courthouse in St. Poelten covering his face with a blue binder to shield himself from reporters, television cameras and photographers and escorted by a phalanx of police officers.  Watch Fritzl arrive in court » . Fritzl faces six charges at a closed-door trial in St. Poelten, 45 miles (70 km) east of Amstetten, where Fritzl lived. Cameras were removed from the court . The trial is scheduled to last five days, but his attorney Rudolph Mayer said it could be shorter. Fritzl was charged in November with incest and the repeated rape of his daughter, Elisabeth, over a 24-year period. But he was also charged with the murder of one of the children he fathered with her, an infant who died soon after birth. State Prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek said Michael Fritzl died from lack of medical care. In an opening statement, prosecuting attorney Christiane Burkheiser handed damp-smelling items from the cellar where Elisabeth and her children had lived to jurors to give them an idea of the conditions in which they were allegedly locked up. In all, Fritzl is charged with: murder, involvement in slave trade (slavery), rape, incest, assault and deprivation of liberty, Sedlacek's office said. He could face a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted of murder. Mayer said Sunday that Fritzl expected to spend the rest of his life in prison. ""This man obviously led a double life for 24 years. He had a wife and had seven kids with her. And then he had another family with his daughter, fathered another seven children with her,"" said Franz Polzer, a police officer in Amstetten, the town where Fritzl lived, at the time of his arrest. The case first came to light in April 2008 when Elisabeth's daughter, Kerstin, became seriously ill with convulsions. Elisabeth persuaded her father to allow Kerstin, then 19, to be taken to a hospital for treatment. Hospital staff became suspicious of the case and alerted police, who discovered the family members in the cellar. Fritzl confessed to police that he raped his daughter, kept her and their children in captivity and burned the body of the dead infant in an oven in the house. Elisabeth told police the infant was one of twins who died a few days after birth. When Elisabeth gained her freedom, she told police her father began sexually abusing her at age 11. On August 8, 1984, she told police, her father enticed her into the basement, where he drugged her, put her in handcuffs and locked her in a room. Fritzl explained Elisabeth's disappearance in 1984 by saying the girl, who was then 18, had run away from home. He backed up the story with letters he forced Elisabeth to write. Elisabeth Fritzl and all but three of her children lived in the specially designed cellar beneath her father's home in Amstetten, Austria, west of Vienna. The other three children lived upstairs with Fritzl and his wife; Fritzl had left them on his own doorstep, pretending the missing Elisabeth had dropped them off. Under Austrian law, if Fritzl is convicted on several offenses, he will be given the sentence linked to the worst crime. The charges he faces are: . • Murder: The infant who died in 1996 died from a lack of medical care, the state prosecutor said. The charge carries a sentence of life in prison. • Involvement in slave trade: From 1984 until 2008, prosecutors allege, Fritzl held his daughter, Elisabeth, captive in a dungeon, abused her sexually and treated her as if she were his personal property -- in a situation similar to slavery. If he is convicted, the sentence could range from 10 to 20 years in prison. • Rape: Between August 30, 1984, and June 30, 1989, Fritzl ""regularly sexually abused Elisabeth,"" according to the prosecutor. The sentence could be from five to 15 years in prison. • Incest: Parallel to the rape charge. It carries a sentence of up to one year. • Withdrawal of liberty: Three of the children Fritzl had with Elisabeth were illegally held captive in a dungeon with no daylight or fresh air, according to prosecutors. That charge carries a sentence of one to 10 years. • Assault: Between August 28, 1984, and April 26, 2006, Fritzl repeatedly threatened Elisabeth and their three children with gas and booby traps as warnings in case they tried to escape, authorities allege. The sentence would range from six months to five years.

"(CNN) -- Anna Nicole Smith's longtime partner and attorney Howard K. Stern and two doctors were charged Thursday with conspiring to furnish drugs before her death in 2007, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. Anna Nicole Smith's boyfriend Howard K. Stern was among those charged Thursday. Smith, 39, was pronounced dead February 8 after being found unconscious in her hotel room at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino near Hollywood, Florida. The former Playboy playmate and reality TV star died from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. At the time of her death several prescription medications -- both in Smith's name and that of her partner and lawyer, Stern -- were found in the room. Officials said prescription and over-the-counter drugs were found in Smith's system, including three antidepressants or antianxiety drugs. Also found in toxicology testing was human growth hormone and chloral hydrate, a sleep medication, officials said. Stern, 40, and doctors Sandeep Kapoor, 40, and Khristine Eroshevich, 61, were each charged with eight felonies, including conspiring to furnish controlled substances, unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions between June 2004 and January 2007 -- only weeks before the playmate's death. Kapoor and Eroshevich were each also charged with obtaining a prescription for opiates by ""fraud, deceit or misrepresentation."" Each were also charged with one count of obtaining a prescription for opiates by giving a false name or address, according to the DA's office. All three were charged with one count of ""prescribing, administering or dispensing a controlled substance to an addict.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A crowd of about 10,000 came to Dodger Stadium on Saturday, but they weren't there for a baseball game. Job seeker Eric Clardy, right, shakes hands with recruiter Raul Mendez from L.A. County Probation Department. While the Dodgers were in Arizona for spring training, more than 80 employers set up employment booths in the parking lot just beyond the center field fence. To those who turned out, finding a job would be a home run. Participating companies included Coca-Cola, Lowe's and Union Bank. And government agencies including the FBI, the Social Security Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers  were there, too. All had one thing in common: They were hiring. And that was music to the ears of 30-year-old Eric Clardy. It has been a rough couple of years for Clardy. He was laid off from his job as a loan processor when the real estate market started to tank. Then, after finding work as a project manager for a plumbing company, layoffs struck again. ""It's kind of like, get the job now so you can pay your bills, then start towards the career that you really want,"" he said. Clardy said his goal is to make contact with at least 10 potential employers a day via phone, letters and the Internet. Being unemployed is hard work, too.  Watch how Clardy goes about trying to find a job » . ""It was a scramble,"" Clardy said. ""I was selling insurance, doing temp jobs, going to job fairs."" The city of Los Angeles and the California Employment Development Department organized Saturday's event, which they said drew about 10,000 people. Earlier this month, a two-day job fair to fill some 500 part-time jobs at the stadium during baseball season drew about 7,000 applicants. California's unemployment rate is 10.1 percent, a full 2 percentage points higher than the national rate. The state's Employment Development office estimates that nearly a half-million state residents have lost their jobs in the past year. ""We are not seeing as many job opportunities as we saw a year ago,"" said Gloria Bratton Moore, who runs the state-funded Work Source job center in Los Angeles. Nonetheless, she said, ""There are jobs available."" But at Dodger Stadium, it was clear that competition for those available jobs is stiff. Applicants were often stacked four and five people deep in front of employer tables, and there was little chance for most of the 10,000 job seekers to make much of an impression. But organizers worked hard to pump up any flagging spirits. ""Yes we can. Yes we can,"" Los Angeles School Board member Monica Garcia chanted over a loudspeaker. State lawmaker Kevin deLeon told the crowd that they are among the nation's hardest-hit in this economic downturn, but he exhorted them to not give up. ""We will get out of this economic funk,"" he said. ""We will recover soon. We've got to have hope."" Garcia and deLeon's comments echoed the campaign slogans of President Obama, who recently won approval of a nearly $800 billion economic stimulus package. Recruiters from the government agencies present at the job fair said that money will start creating jobs within the next few months. The Army Corps of Engineers told applicants that it is hiring for a wide variety of positions, including those for engineers, heavy-equipment operators and environmental field workers. The Commerce Department is adding more than 1 million jobs in preparation of the 2010 census, and other federal agencies are hiring as well. All of that was good news to Clardy, who left resumes and filled out applications at a number of the 80 booths cluttering the stadium's parking lot. But he remained realistic about this day's activities leading directly to a job. ""It seemed like a couple of years ago, the job fair was really your first interview,"" he said. ""Now it doesn't seem like that. Some companies are not even taking resumes at the job fairs anymore.""","Eighty employers set up booths in parking lot of Dodger Stadium .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden called Israel's recent offensive in Gaza a ""holocaust,"" according to a purported message from him posted on an Islamist Web site. Osama bin Laden, in an undated photo, apparently taped a message calling Israel's Gaza offensive a holocaust. ""The holocaust of Gaza in the midst of this long siege is an important and historic event and an articulate tragedy which affirms the need for detachment of the Muslims from the hypocrites. It is not right that our condition after what happened in Gaza be like our condition prior to it,"" the message said. Al Qaeda says it wants to liberate the mosque from Israeli control. The message -- an audiotape played over a still image -- is called ""Practical Steps to Liberate Palestine"" and it is dated March 2009, according to terrorism analyst Laura Mansfield. The more than 33 minutes-long tape includes English subtitles, and English and Arabic transcripts were released by As Sahab, al Qaeda's media production center, Mansfield said. The authenticity of the tape could not be verified. The message says it's ""clear"" some Arab leaders have ""conspired"" with what it calls the ""Zionist-crusader alliance"" against the Palestinians in Gaza. ""They are the ones that America describes as the moderate leaders in our world,"" the message says. The speaker urged Muslims to help insurgents ""liberate"" Iraq. ""For those honest in their desire to deliver al-Aqsa mosque, they should back the Mujahideen in Iraq with everything they need in order to liberate Mesopotamia,"" the message said, alluding to the Jerusalem mosque regarded as the third holiest place in Islam. ""And with that they will have defeated the Zionists' biggest ally,"" referring to the United States. Then, the fighters should move on to Jordan to ""liberate all of Palestine from the sea to the river"" from Israel. When talking about Palestine, the speaker is referring to the region between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River that includes the Jewish state of Israel and the Palestinian lands of the West Bank and Gaza. In his last purported audio message in January, bin Laden called for a jihad, or holy war, to stop Israel's military campaign in Gaza.","NEW: Message condemns Arab leaders who ""conspire"" with Israel .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan kept their seven-point lead at the top of Serie A with a 2-0 win over Fiorentina in the San Siro in Sunday's late match in Italy. Ibrahimovic powers home a 30-meter free-kick in stoppage time at the San Siro. Inter showed no signs of their Champions League disappointment at Manchester United as Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic struck in each half. Ibrahimovic scored the opener after 11 minutes but Inter had to survive some nervous moments against a committed away side before he sealed victory in stoppage time with a thumping free-kick. Title rivals Juventus had won 4-1 at Bologna on Saturday evening to put the pressure on Jose Mourinho's men. Inter's arch-rivals AC Milan also enjoyed an important win on Sunday with a 5-1 thrashing of Siena to stay third. Veteran striker Filippo Inzaghi scored twice, including his 300th career goal in the away victory. David Beckham, who shrugged off an injury to play, set up Inzaghi for his first goal and the side's second. Andrea Pirlo scored the opener from the penalty spot, while Alexander Pato also netted twice, as Milan proved too strong for their opponents -- for whom Massimo Maccarone was on target. Roma lost further ground in the race for the fourth Champions League place as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Sampdoria. Julio Baptista gave the visitors a seventh-minute lead but Giampaolo Pazzini headed home an equalizer before the same player put the home side ahead after a mistake from goalkeeper Doni.

"(CNN) -- Top Democratic lawmakers called Tuesday for high taxes on the controversial AIG bonuses, as new details emerged on who got those bonuses. Congress is looking at ways to deal with the outrage surrounding AIG's controversial bonuses. ""My colleagues and I are sending a letter to [AIG CEO Edward] Liddy informing him that he can go right ahead and tell the employees that are scheduled to get bonuses that they should voluntarily return them,"" Sen. Charles Schumer said on the Senate floor. ""Because if they don't, we plan to tax virtually all of [the money] ... so it is returned to its rightful owners, the taxpayers."" Schumer's comments came the same day New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo confirmed in a letter to Congress that AIG paid 73 employees bonuses of more than $1 million each. Cuomo also wrote that 11 of the employees no longer work for the company. The largest bonus paid was $6.4 million; seven other people also received more than $4 million each. ""Until we obtain the names of these individuals, it is impossible to determine when and why they left the firm and how it is that they received these payments,""  Cuomo wrote to a congressional committee. AIG has been under fire for awarding seven-figure bonuses to employees while being kept afloat by more than $170 billion from the U.S. government's financial bailout. The company insists the payouts are needed to keep talented executives on the payroll, but public anger over the moves has prompted Congress and the Obama administration to seek some ways to reclaim the money.  Watch Sen. Schumer vow to recoup the bonuses » . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on the Senate floor Tuesday that the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee will pursue a legislative fix in such a way that the ""recipients of those bonuses will not be able to keep all their money -- and that's an understatement."" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Montana, will propose a special tax within the next 24 hours, Reid said. ""I don't think those bonuses should be paid,"" Baucus said Tuesday. The special-tax idea was first floated Monday by Sen. Chris Dodd, chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. ""We have a right to tax,"" the Connecticut Democrat told CNN. ""You could write a tax provision that's narrowly crafted only to the people receiving bonuses.""  Watch why Americans have a right to be angry » . At an unrelated hearing Tuesday at which IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman was testifying, Baucus asked the nation's top tax official, ""What's the highest excise tax we can impose that's sustainable in court?"" Shulman did not respond directly, but Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, chimed in to suggest the tax could be as high as ""90 percent."" President Obama on Monday expressed dismay and anger over the bonuses to executives at AIG. ""This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed,"" Obama told politicians and reporters in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, where he and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner were unveiling a package to aid the nation's small businesses. Obama said he will attempt to block bonuses for AIG, payments he described as an ""outrage.""  See a snapshot of facts, attitudes and analysis on the recession » . ""Under these circumstances, it's hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses, much less $165 million in extra pay. I mean, how do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat?"" Obama was referring to the bonuses paid to traders in AIG's financial products division, the tiny group of people who crafted complicated deals that contributed to the shaking of the world's economic foundations.  Watch Obama say he's outraged by bonuses » . The president said he has asked Geithner to ""pursue every single legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole."" Obama said he would work with Congress to change the laws so that such a situation cannot happen again. The president spared Liddy from criticism, saying he got the job ""after the contracts that led to these bonuses were agreed to last year."" But he said the impropriety of the bonuses goes beyond economics. ""It's about our fundamental values,"" he said. iReport.com: Sound off on AIG . Under pressure from the Treasury, AIG scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or ""retention payments"" -- by at least 30 percent. That has done little to temper outrage over the initial plan, however. In the House, Democrats are trying to shame AIG executives into forgoing the bonuses. They're also investigating possible legal avenues Congress can take to force the company to return money used for bonuses, a House Democratic leadership aide and a House Financial Services Committee aide said Monday. The committee is trying to determine whether Congress can force AIG to renegotiate the bonuses, which the company says it is legally required to give employees under contracts negotiated before the company received its first infusion of bailout dollars in September, according to the committee aide.  Who's insured by AIG? » . Both aides said it is unclear what authority Congress might have to force AIG to take back the bonuses. Liddy will face intense questioning about the bonuses when he testifies Wednesday before the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets. CNN's Ted Barrett, Dana Bash and Elaine Quijano contributed to this report.","NEW: Sen.

"(CNN) -- Like the neighbors of a new kid who just moved into the big fancy house down the block, many Latin American leaders are curious about President Obama. Latin America expert Otto Reich says the summit is an ""opportunity, but also a risk for U.S. policy."" The heads of 34 nations will get a chance to see him up close next month at the Fifth Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago. What he says will be closely watched. ""The spotlight will be entirely on Barack Obama,"" said Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue. Hakim will be one of three people who will on Wednesday address the House Foreign Affairs Committee about the summit. Otto Reich, who served Presidents Reagan and both Bushes in a number of high-level Latin American posts, also will speak. Thomas F. ""Mack"" McLarty, former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, will be the third person. Reich has some advice for Obama: Be careful. ""The summit is an opportunity, but also a risk for U.S. policy,"" Reich said. ""Not all the neighbors there are good. Why do we recognize this reality when we lock our doors at night but don't recognize it in our foreign policy?"" Reich said the United States must differentiate between its friends, primarily Colombia and Mexico, which are under attack from drug traffickers and organized crime, and hostile countries, particularly Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua. Cuba, which was expelled from the Organization of American States, is not allowed to attend the summit. ""Obama can't look at this group of people and think he's among a group of friends,"" Reich said. ""Let's not look at this as a community of 34 countries. They are very different people."" Hakim said Obama must ask Latin American leaders to share the burden. ""He shouldn't simply say what the United States is going to do,"" Hakim said. ""He should say what he expects Latin America to do."" Hakim pointed out several areas Obama needs to address. First, he said, ""He must make clear he's trying to fix the U.S. economy."" He said Obama also will have to deal with the one nation that won't be there -- Cuba. The United States broke diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961 and imposed an economic embargo in 1962. President Bush increased some restrictions in the past eight years. Obama has signaled that he's ready to start relaxing some of the prohibitions. ""This is the issue of greatest symbolic importance,"" Hakim said. ""It will be seen as a test of real U.S. readiness to change in the hemisphere. What he says about Cuba will make headlines."" But Reich warns that the United States should extract some conditions from Cuba before making any allowances. ""There's a way it can be done to advance the conditions of the people in Cuba,"" he said. ""I don't approve of the unilateral way it's being done. The embargo is a negotiating tool. We should not negotiate with ourselves, and that's what we're doing."" Hakim also said Obama must address ""the pandemic of criminal violence"" destroying many parts of Latin America. U.S. aid is focused primarily on Mexico and Colombia. ""Is the United States going to go beyond Mexico and Colombia?"" he asked. ""Is the United States ready to rethink it's drug strategy, which has done so little?"" A new approach to the drug war has received increased support and attention recently. The former presidents of Mexico, Colombia and Brazil called last month for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in tactics on the war on drugs. Ex-presidents Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil made their announcement at a meeting in Brazil of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy. ""The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results,"" Gaviria said at a news conference in which the commission's recommendations were presented. The 17-member panel worked on the report for a year. Gaviria said the time is right to start a debate on the subject, particularly with the pragmatic openings provided by Obama's election. The Fifth Summit of the Americas will be held in Port of Spain April 17-19. The periodic meetings bring together the 34 democratically elected heads of state and governments in the Western Hemisphere to discuss regional issues. The first summit was held in Miami, Florida, in December 1994. The most recent took place in Mar del Plata, Argentina, in November 2005.","Obama goes to Fifth Summit of the Americas next month .

"(CNN) -- North Korea fully reopened its border to South Koreans on Tuesday, without explaining its reversal, the South's Unification Ministry said. Cross-border gates between North and South Korea were closed on March 9. The communist nation shut its border on March 9, calling 12-day U.S.-South Korean military exercises a threat to its safety. But on Tuesday, North Korea normalized visits by South Korean workers and cargo trucks to an industrial complex jointly run with the South, Yonhap said. ""The North Korean side sent us a letter of approval this morning,"" the news agency quoted Unification Ministry official Lee Jong-joo as saying. The letter did not explain the North's reversal, Lee told Yonhap. Two batches of workers, totaling 287 people, crossed the border into North Korea on Tuesday, according to the Unification Ministry. More than 300 were scheduled to return at the end of the workday. North Korea had partly opened its border Monday, allowing nearly 300 South Koreans to return home. Many of the South Koreans work at the industrial complex in the North Korean border town of Kaesong. The border closing was part of a recent series of aggressive moves by North Korea, which included cutting the last remaining communications channel between North and South; saying that the North could not guarantee the safety of South Korean passenger jets in its airspace during the annual joint military exercises; and threatening to retaliate if a ""satellite"" launch from its northeastern coast was intercepted, saying interference would ""mean a war."" U.S. and South Korean officials have said that North Korea appears to be preparing to test-fire its long-range missile, the Taepodong-2, under the guise of launching a satellite into space. The missile is thought to have an intended range of about 4,200 miles (6,700 kilometers) that, if true, could give it the capability of striking Alaska or Hawaii.","NEW: North Korea fully reopens its border to South Koreans without explanation .

"(CNN) -- NASA won't have to maneuver the international space station to dodge a piece of debris from a Soviet-era satellite spinning around Earth, the space agency announced Monday. NASA says debris won't threaten the international space station, seen here from Endeavour in November 2008. Mission controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston warned earlier that a piece of the Kosmos 1275 was to pass about 1/2 mile from the space station early Tuesday morning. But after further study, NASA determined no evasive action would be needed, said Paul Dye, flight director for the space shuttle Discovery, which is en route to the station. ""The latest tracking information showed it is outside of our area of concern, so the station is going to be right where we expected it to be,"" Dye told reporters at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Discovery lifted off from Florida on Sunday for a scheduled docking at 5:13 p.m. ET Tuesday. The spacecraft is not threatened by the debris, said LeRoy Cain, the shuttle program's deputy manager. The dimensions of the satellite debris were not known Monday. The object was expected to pass ""on the fringes"" of the 2 km-by-25 km-by-25 km (1.25 mile-by-15 mile-by-15 mile) safety zone controllers monitor, Dye said. ""It's a very low probability of hit -- less than one in 100,000,"" he said. The space shuttle Discovery is currently headed toward the station for a scheduled docking Tuesday, but the spacecraft is not threatened by the debris, said LeRoy Cain, the shuttle program's deputy manager. Last week, a piece of debris forced the space station's current crew -- astronauts Mike Fincke and Sandy Magnus, and cosmonaut Yury Lonchakov -- to take shelter in its escape capsule, a rare close call for the orbiting platform, NASA said. That object, a chunk of metal from a satellite rocket motor used on an earlier space mission, was about 5 inches across, and moving at nearly 20,000 mph. It passed within 3 miles of the station early Thursday afternoon and was detected too late for the station to maneuver out of the way, controllers said. iReport.com: See, share your photos of launches and space . Cain called the prospect of two close passes in less than a week a ""random"" occurrence, but said controllers have frequently had to maneuver around pieces of orbital junk.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Radio host Don Imus has prostate cancer. Radio shock jock Don Imus has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The shock jock made the announcement on his radio show Monday morning. Imus learned of the Stage 2 prostate cancer diagnosis last Wednesday, said Laurie Cantillo, program director for WABC-AM of New York. A bone scan indicated that the cancer has not spread, she said, and doctors believe it is fully treatable. Stage 2 prostate cancer means the cancer can be felt on exam but has not spread beyond the prostate gland. Imus, 68, said he's been on an organic diet for the past 10 years, avoiding meat and fish and eating mostly fruits and vegetables. ""It wasn't great, but I was surprised,"" Imus said after learning the results of a biopsy that was performed last Monday. He added that he plans to go to San Francisco, California, for a second opinion. Imus said he's spoken with Sen. John Kerry and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani about his diagnosis. Kerry and Giuliani are both prostate cancer survivors. Imus exuded confidence while discussing his situation. ""They are predicting they can treat it. They can cure it."" Imus returned to the radio in December of 2007, months after his inflammatory remarks caused the cancellation of his morning radio show on the CBS radio network. His four-hour program is syndicated nationally by the Citadel Broadcasting Corp. Known for decades for his outspoken comments and off-color humor, Imus sparked a public outcry with his comments in April 2007 about the Rutgers University women's basketball team.  The controversy eventually led to the cancellation of his show by CBS Radio. He called the Scarlet Knights ""tough girls"" and ""nappy-headed 'hos"" during a national broadcast a day after the team lost the NCAA championship to the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers. He later apologized.","NEW: Imus says he was ""surprised"" by biopsy results, will seek a second opinion .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A man walks around the side of a building, footsteps falling in time to the heartbeat of a driving pop soundtrack, pulls out a pistol and guns down another man. Tony Servillo as arch-manipulator and seven time Italian Prime Minister, Guilio Andreotti, in Paolo Sorrentino's ""Il Divo."" A montage of grisly murders follows, all with the same infectious pop song pounding in the background. It's edge-of-the-seat stuff and it's only the opening sequence of gifted Italian director Paolo Sorrentino's biopic of Italian politician Giulio Andreotti, ""Il Divo."" Sorrentino's film chronicles the career of probably the most important and controversial politico in Italy's recent history. But, more than that, it pins Andreotti to the specimen board and dissects his character without mercy. The film caught the eye of the judges at Cannes Film Festival last year where it picked up the Jury Prize. Predictably, Andreotti didn't react well to the film. ""He was very angry,"" recalls Sorrentino. Now 91 years-old, Andreotti has been Prime Minister of Italy seven times. His Christian Democrat Party was the leading force in Italian politics as a one-party system for four decades. The rules of the game were shattered in the early 1990s by ""Tangentopoli""  or Bribesville -- a corruption scandal that laid bare some of the government's unsavory practices, ruining careers and resulting in the suicides of some leading politicians. Andreotti himself was implicated in illegal activities, including connections to the Mafia, but was finally acquitted of all charges. Today, he is a senator for life. Something of the man's influence in all spheres of Italian public life becomes clear when Sorrentino -- who says he is not a political director, ""only in this case"" -- explains how hard he found it to fund the film. ""In Italy nobody wanted to finance the film because everybody was scared,"" Sorrentino told CNN. ""He has been a very powerful man for many years."" Sorrentino managed eventually to secure funding from a private source. ""It is not easy for Italian companies to put money in this project, so we did it with the private money of very courageous individuals,"" he said. Sorrentino picks up the Andreotti story at the beginning of the 1990s, just prior to his implication in the scandal, as he is about to assume power for the seventh time. A good deal of ""Il Divo's"" success lies in a stunning portrayal of Andreotti by Naples-born actor Toni Servillo, who is a veteran of three of Sorrentino's other films including 2006's ""The Consequences of Love."" Servillo's Andreotti is a stiff, impassive tortoise of a man. With a hunched back, skinny sloping shoulders and strange drooping ears, Andreotti appears physically frail. He is beset by headaches -- indeed, the opening scene of the film shows him with a head full of acupuncture needles trying to get rid of one -- a taste of the mix of drama and humor that informs the rest of the film. But where the body is weak the will is strong and in Andreotti's wit and cunning intelligence -- ""I know I'm an average man, but looking around I don't see any giants"" -- there is a sense of a man who can and will do anything to stay in power. ""I have always wanted to make a film about Andreotti,"" says Sorrentino. ""He is so psychologically complex that everyone has been intrigued by him over the years. ""It's a political film but at the same time a film about a complex character from a psychological point of view."" For a long time, though, Sorrentino was convinced that the vast amounts of literature written about the man could never be distilled into a structure that would work on film -- ""It made my head spin,"" he remembers. While Sorrentino almost had too much material to mine while researching Andreotti's public life, it was impossible to get access to details of his home life. Sorrentino had to go on instinct and imagine life behind the scenes for the great man. Something that made aspects of Andreotti's response to the film very puzzling. ""He told everything was false, a lie, about his public life and at the same time he said the film was very precise about his private life,"" recalls Sorrentino. ""But all the public things in the film are documented. It's on record that the events took place. ""The trials, the letters, the diary of Aldo Moro, the Prime Minister who was kidnapped by the Red Brigade and held in captivity for 55 days. (Andreotti was Prime Minister at the time and decided not to negotiate with the terrorists and they killed him.) ""And about the private life I invented everything."" One of the most surprising things about the 39-year-old director's film is the soundtrack. Full of rock, pop, electronica -- ""Nux Vomica"" by The Veils an indie band from New Zealand and ""Toop Toop"" by French electro artists Cassius -- mixed in with classical music like Vivaldi and Sibelius. It's incongruous but it delivers a hefty emotional punch. ""The idea was to make a rock opera about a man very far from rock,"" says Sorrentino. ""I didn't want to do a traditional biopic.""","Paolo Sorrentino's ""Il Divo"" chronicles the career of Italian politician Guilio Andreotti .

Students start groups on social networking Web sites to discuss the dogs they left at home. (UWIRE) -- For freshman Elise Chen, home is only a phone call away. It's keeping in touch with Sammy, her collie-lab mix, that's the problem. ""I can talk to my dog on the phone, but I don't get anything out of it,"" Chen said. Chen is not the only student who misses her pet, an integral part of many families. According to membership in Facebook groups dedicated to the topic, at least 44,845 others are in the same boat. There are at least six groups dedicated to missing one's pet on the social networking site; the largest, ""I love college, but I miss my dog,"" stands at 31,056 members. The group's wall is full of declarations of love for dogs at home, often accompanied by pictures and funny stories in the photo and discussion board sections. Chen, one of the group's newest members, said she joined when she realized the forum was a literal representation of missing her dog. In some respects, Chen said, she actually misses her dog more than she misses her parents. ""My dog never says 'Go to bed,' or 'You have to be in by two,' "" she said. ""My dog just says, 'I'm happy to see you, even if it's 2:30 in the morning.' "" GW's Facebook network has its own group for pet lovers: ""I Miss My Dog."" Its 89 members frequently post pictures of their ""four- and sometimes three-legged friends at home,"" as the group's description states. The group's active members use it as a way to further express themselves on Facebook and to cope with missing their animals back home. Like Chen, junior Jared Stone said he did not realize how much his dogs were a part of his life until he came to college. ""In the past, I had always been at home and always been around my dogs,"" Stone said. ""I was used to having them nearby and petting them while watching TV. So in college, their absence hit me and I found the group on Facebook an accurate representation of how I was feeling."" Although a freshman like Chen is still adjusting to college life away from pets, Stone has learned that students must learn to deal with missing their pets. ""Friends fill the gap so much, but can only go so far,"" he said. ""I've overcome it, but it's still nothing you can really get over."" Many students, including law student and ""I Miss My Dog"" member Rebecca Rodgers, hope to eventually have dogs of their own, but they know that college is not conducive to pet ownership. ""My studio is no place for a dog and definitely not with a crazy law school schedule,"" Rodgers said. When Rodgers misses her Australian shepherd, Missy, she turns to the popular video-sharing Web site YouTube. ""I tend to watch (my) particular breed of dog, Australian shepherds,"" Rodgers said. ""Seeing other people's dogs makes me miss mine a little less."" Chen also uses technology to cope, though in a more personal manner. ""I video chat with my dog,"" she said. Although she does not plan on getting a dog on campus any time soon, she jokes about adopting a ""hallway dog"" for Lafayette, where she lives this year. The Internet and hopes for the future, though good coping aids, can only help those missing their pets to an extent. Rodgers said, ""Sometimes I look over my shoulder and expect a dog to follow me around.""","College student: I miss my dog more than I miss my parents .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexico has announced plans to raise tariffs on almost 90 U.S. exports, Mexican and U.S. officials confirmed Monday. Mexico's state-run news agency says tariffs are in retaliation for cancellation of a U.S. trucking project. The new trade measures are in retaliation for the cancellation earlier this year of a U.S. commercial trucking project and will target U.S. industrial and agricultural products delivered to Mexico, Mexico's state-run news agency said. Mexico's Economic Secretary Gerardo Ruiz Mateos called the cancellation of the program a breach of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the agency said. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the trucking project was killed in the 2009 omnibus appropriations bill, but President Barack Obama has asked his administration to create a new program. ""Congress has opposed the project in the past because of concerns about the process that led to the program's establishment and its operation,"" Gibbs said. The project allowed a small number of Mexican trucks to enter the United States beyond the normal commercial zones, and allowed some U.S. trucks the same privilege in Mexico. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, warned that the Mexican action would harm American businesses. ""Unfortunately, this is a predictable reaction by the Mexican government to a policy that now puts the United States in clear violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and was inappropriately inserted into the omnibus appropriations bill,"" McCain said after learning of the Mexican government's plans. McCain said Washington ""must take steps to prevent escalation of further protectionist measures -- actions that only serve to harm American business during these tough economic times when these businesses need a worldwide marketplace to prosper."" ""This is another reason why the president should have vetoed the omnibus spending bill,"" McCain added. Mexico's intentions to raise tariffs on U.S. goods ""is an absurd overreaction to the shutdown of the unsafe cross-border trucking pilot program,"" Teamsters President Jim Hoffa said. ""The right response from Mexico would be to make sure its drivers and trucks are safe enough to use our highways without endangering our drivers,"" Hoffa said in a statement issued by the union. ""The border must stay closed until Mexico holds up its end of the bargain.""","Tariffs will target about 90 U.S. industrial, agricultural products delivered to Mexico .

"(CNN) -- In an attempt to be frugal amid the economic downturn, Karl Stetson and his family in Seattle, Washington, planned to skip their annual trip to Hawaii. Water rushes toward the shore at Sandy Beach Park in Honolulu, Hawaii. That is until Stetson began noticing airfare and hotel rates plunge this year. Last week, he caved, purchasing plane tickets for less than $450 a person, a sweet deal compared with $600 last year. He booked rooms at Hanalei Colony Resort, among the emerald mountains in Kauai, for 25 percent off, and he was delighted to receive one of the nights free. ""We might have done something on the mainland, something more low-key, but the fact that it was inexpensive was a big factor for us to go again,"" said Stetson, who is taking his wife and two young boys in May. Outdoor enthusiasts, lovebirds and families prudently resisting the urge to visit Hawaii, say aloha to majorly discounted airfares and hotel rates -- many hitting rock-bottom prices -- this year. The bittersweet theory seems to hold true: What is bad for the travel industry has been good for consumers. As Hawaii suffers from its biggest visitor decline since the Great Depression, the state is enticing travelers with discounted deals to offset the toll on its local economy. iReport.com: Toughing out the recession? Airfare to Hawaii from cities in the continental United States has plummeted more than 30 percent in some markets, according to FareCompare.com, an airfare research Web site. Pleasant Holidays, one of the nation's largest privately owned travel companies, is offering vacation packages that include flight and three nights hotel stay in Oahu starting at $299. Online travel giants Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz are all offering sales on Hawaii flights, hotels and activities, and some luxury hotels have rooms for less than $150 a night. ""You won't see prices to Hawaii like this again in your lifetime,"" FareCompare CEO Rick Seaney said. ""It might be worth it to take that once-in-a-lifetime trip."" For decades, tourists from the United States and abroad have flocked to Hawaii, many captivated by the exotic islands' natural beauty: snow-capped mountains, active volcanoes, breathtaking waterfalls and pristine beaches. Now with the administration of President Obama, who spent part of his childhood in Hawaii, there is a renewed interest for tourists to visit, travel experts say. But travelers have long viewed Hawaii as an expensive destination in comparison with Florida or California. Two adults can expect to spend $673 a day in Honolulu on food and lodging, making Hawaii the most expensive destination in the country, according to the AAA's 2008 Annual Vacation Costs Survey. It is no surprise, then, that in a brutal economy where consumer confidence is low, the islands are having a tough time reeling in visitors, despite discounted prices. The state reported a 12.4 percent decline in visitors, or 72,255 fewer guests, in January compared with the same time last year. The drop, which started last spring, is a reversal of nearly a decade of visitor growth. To make matters worse, visitor spending in Hawaii declined by 13.6 percent in January, and many state officials and experts are worried what that will mean for a state where tourism is the backbone industry. Nationwide, the tourism picture looks bleak, as the number of travelers is expected to fall throughout 2009, according to the Travel Industry Association of America. In the Aloha State, the smaller, more remote islands like Lana'i and Moloka'i are feeling the most pain. They received about a third fewer visitors in January than the year before. ""This is a downturn,"" said Mark B. Dunkerley, who sits on the board of the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii and is CEO of Hawaiian Airlines. Dunkerley explained that the decline in visitors may be troubling, but the numbers are still as strong as they were a decade ago. ""It's not a catastrophe. The clock has been wound back."" Signs of decline for Hawaii began last spring with the shutdown of Aloha and ATA Airlines, which held about a fifth of the market share. By the summer, fuel prices had skyrocketed to $135 a barrel, which drove fares to an unaffordable price point for many travelers. That same year, NCL Corp.'s Norwegian Cruise Lines pulled back stops to Hawaii. Rob Pacheco, the president of Hawaii Forest & Trail, said he noticed about 3,000 fewer customers after some of the cruise ships stopped coming. The company, which gives natural tours of the island, said things ""just kind of deteriorated, and it was more difficult to fill seats."" Another challenge Hawaii faces in terms of tourism is its remote location on an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean. This makes the state's tourism industry highly dependent on airfare prices. iReport.com: Where's your favorite secret hideaway? Traditionally, economical travelers shy away from Hawaii because of the high flight cost, travel experts said. But the airfare prices being offered until June show that prices may be more affordable than most leisure travelers think. A flight from Boston, Massachusetts, on Delta, United or American Airlines is running about $461 round trip, down from $610 at the same time last year, according to FareCompare.com. Travelers from major West Coast cities such as Los Angeles, California, can find flights just under $340, nearly 30 percent off the ticket price from a year ago, the site reported. Adding to the vacation savings are hotels, including lavish resorts, advertising rates about 20 percent lower in the first quarter of 2009 compared with first-quarter 2008, according to online travel companies. Hotels scrambled to offer lower rates when they saw occupancy numbers dive for the first time in years. Hotels say that in addition to the discount on the rooms, there are perks and added value such as upgrades, free nights and dinner coupons, travel experts say. For example, Outrigger Hotels and Resorts, owned by Outrigger Enterprises Group, is offering the third night free for travelers who book a stay in Waikiki this month for $159 a night. A year ago, the lowest the rate at the hotel was nearly $100 more. ""You can travel better than you have in the past for the same amount of money,"" said Ian Jeffries, an Expedia travel expert. ""Or you could do the exact same thing as last year and save money."" Travelers can also snatch bargains at condos and rental properties. This is particularly true on the islands of Maui and Oahu, where there has been major development in recent years, says Pauline Frommer, creator of the Pauline Frommer Guidebooks. ""You can play 'let's make a deal' with these folks,"" said Frommer, who has been tracking the travel industry for almost 20 years. ""They are desperate for people's business."" But don't expect the deals to paradise to last forever. Prices will climb during peak summer season and as soon as the economy recovers. Though experts are unsure when recovery will happen, Hawaii's Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism predicts that won't be until 2011. In the meantime, Hawaii tourism groups want to change American and international travelers' impression that a trip there is too expensive. With Japan suffering from its own economic woes, arrivals of Japanese tourists, once a steady revenue stream, have slowed, travel experts said. ""The difficulty is the fact that it's not a Hawaii-centered problem,"" said John Monahan, president of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau. ""We have a nationwide and global crisis.""","Airfare to Hawaii has plunged more than 30 percent in some markets .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As he walks past the tiny, dingy waiting area into an equally cramped garage, Nui Srisook says business at his car repair shop is thriving. Drivers are choosing to keep their old cars longer, and they're turning to repair shops to make it so, observers say. Sales are up 20 percent this month and Srisook spends most nights working late, helping his customers to get extra mileage out of their old cars. ""Most of the customers right now we see, they don't really have much extra money to ... buy a new car. So that's why they just do repair,"" Srisook said. ""And now, people are willing to spend more money on maintaining the car, deciding what is broke, anything that needs to be maintained on the car."" As more cash-strapped Americans turn to do-it-yourself projects and bargain shopping, car repair shops like Srisook's are feeling the boon. Drivers are choosing to keep their old cars longer, and often they're willing to put in the money to do so, observers say. The Automotive Service Association reports their members' sales were up 16 percent over last year.  Watch Kate Bolduan's report on the thriving auto repair industry » . ""That indicated that people were coming in and putting the vehicle in the repair facilities' hands and saying, 'Look, I am going to be keeping this car. I want to be sure it runs well. I want to be sure that if there are any safety issues or any maintenance issues that I have overlooked, let's get those taken care of,' "" said ASA President Ron Pyle. Pyle said that's a change from the past, when drivers would scrimp on the cost of maintenance and repair. ""That was surprising news. We didn't expect that in the midst of the beginnings of the economic woes,"" Pyle said. ""But they are looking at the cost of trying to purchase a new vehicle ... so I think that in relative terms that $1,000 repair to keep a $2,500 car running may be an attractive alternative."" The economic slump has cut automakers deeply. Last month, sales of new cars were down more than 40 percent compared with the same time last year, according to sales tracker Autodata. The trend seems to have translated into increased traffic at auto parts stores. ""We're doing way more business. The phones are ringing, you know, customers are walking in,"" said Darryl Wright, owner of D.C. Brake & Bearings Co. ""Basically, if it's broke, they fix it."" In the past, only savvy auto mechanics knew to shop at Wright's nondescript discount store. Now, he sees more car owners who are looking for a cheaper deal on parts. ""[Customers will] find a guy on the street, you know -- Joe Shady Mechanics is what we call them -- to fix it at a deeper discount rate, labor-wise, and they'll send the customer in here to buy the parts on their own,"" Wright said. ""So people are saving money that way too."" Srisook said he keeps service prices low to appeal to those bargain shoppers, such as Esther White, a loyal customer. She brought in her daughter's 1996 Oldsmobile for new rotors and brakes, and said her daughter would be driving the car ""until it drops dead."" ""Believe it or not, we were raised to fix things, and to hold on to things as long as we could,"" White said. ""But it goes back to today's economy, and making the right financial decisions.""","As more strapped Americans opt to fix their cars, repair shops are doing well .

"Editor's note: Rachel Motte blogs at www.evangelicaloutpost.com and writes for Wheatstone Academy, a Christian educational program for high school students. She is a graduate of Biola University and the Torrey Honors Institute. Rachel Motte says Rush Limbaugh still can animate conservative popular opinion. (CNN) -- It's no secret that liberals throughout the nation are rejoicing at Rush Limbaugh's supposed status as leader of the Republican Party. I can see why. He's easy to pick on. His rhetoric is extreme, and his personal life has at times been less than picture-perfect. I've heard some pundits refer to Vice President Joe Biden as ""the gift that keeps on giving."" I imagine the left feels the same way about Limbaugh. Rush was an integral part of my childhood. I must have been 6 or 7 when I started listening in the late 1980s. I remember that my parents and their friends found him refreshing, and I remember that he made them laugh. I memorized his song parodies and even tried to write a few of my own based on the events I heard him talk about. When I was 11, I once spent several hours trying to call his show, redialing after every busy signal, over and over. I never got through. It's probably just as well; I think I had planned to try to talk him into running for president. I no longer think he'd make a good president -- we're all much better off when he sits behind the EIB microphone. Rush taught me a lot about personal responsibility, the value of freedom of speech and the love of country. At 26, I've outgrown many of my childhood habits, but I never outgrew Rush. Have conservatives outgrown him? Is it time to distance ourselves by dismissing him as just ""an entertainer,"" as Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele initially did before apologizing? My friend John Mark Reynolds wrote recently that Rush is ""a shallow thinker"" who will alienate today's young adults rather than draw them in. He argued that Rush's ""insider lingo"" and harsh demeanor are problematic at a time when the Republican Party is losing the young adult vote. Is he right? Has Rush Limbaugh outlived his usefulness to the conservative movement? Should we take a cue from the Democrats' glee and relegate El Rushbo to a back room like an aging and unpopular distant relative? Not by a long shot. Rush doesn't need to be removed as leader of the Republican Party, because he's never held that position, much as Democrats would like you to think he has. He's a vitally necessary part of the conservative movement, but he's no one's leader. Don't give him more credit than he deserves, and don't fall prey to the Democrats' carefully planned attempts to inflate his authority. Steele learned the hard way a few days ago that the opposite extreme is also not true -- Rush is not a mere entertainer. One of his most important contributions to the conservative movement has been his ability to energize the base. This is particularly vital now given the recent election results. Someone has to keep the troops from giving up, and like it or not, for now that someone is Rush. It doesn't really matter whether he's a shallow thinker. What does matter is that he knows how to prod people into action. That's all well and good, but is it sustainable? What works for me and for the many other ""Rush babies"" out there may not work for our younger siblings. Thanks to the Obama campaign, new activists aren't going to be as easily attracted by witty aphorisms and wordplays as previous demographics were. President Obama's impressive rhetorical skills appeared to raise the level of public discourse during the campaign. As far as I can tell he didn't actually say anything new, but so many things sounded new when he said them. I don't think he changed the content of the age-old feud between right and left, but he did change the style, providing a stark contrast to the admittedly strident tones of some on the right. That's going to change the way young people all over will approach the political process; after all, 66 percent of the 29-and-under crowd voted for Obama. Rush's personal influence will decline because of this shift in rhetorical style, but we're not yet at the point where it is unimportant. The current crop of college students may not call themselves ""dittoheads,"" but their mentors and heroes within the movement still do, and that will continue to be significant for a while yet. Do we need leaders who can inspire the next generation of young conservatives? Absolutely. Is Rush the best man for that job? At this point, yes, though that will probably change in the next few years. One thing is likely -- the next big conservative leaders who do resonate well with the age group that favors Obama will cite Rush as a major influence. His work won't end with him. And that's as it should be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rachel Motte.","Rachel Motte says she grew up listening to Rush Limbaugh and became a big fan .
She says Limbaugh's style still has great appeal to conservatives .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- A Thai judge fined dozens of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges of illegal entry after escaping from their own country a month ago -- amid allegations that other Rohingya have been dumped at sea by the Thai army. Male refugees show scars they say were caused by beatings at the hands of the Myanmar navy. The Ranong Provincial Court judge ordered each of the 66 ethnic Muslim refugees to pay 1,000 Thai baht (less than $30). He imposed the fines via a closed-circuit television link to Ranong Provincial Prison, where the refugees will continue to be held until they can pay the court. Twelve additional refugees, all teenagers, were being detained at a police station and are exempt from prosecution. The 78 refugees will be handed over on January 31 to immigration police, who will deport them. It is unclear where they will be sent. The refugees arrived by boat on the Thai shore, and Thai police said many had severe burns from a fire that broke out on board their craft after it left neighboring Myanmar, also known as Burma. Members of Myanmar's Rohingya minority have been fleeing the country for years, saying they are persecuted by its military government. One refugee, who called himself Mohamed, told CNN that their boat had been at sea for a month, and that Myanmar's military had detained and attacked them before setting their boat on fire. The refugees are unwelcome in Thailand, where authorities say about 20,000 have settled illegally. Other boatloads of Rohingya have allegedly been set adrift after being towed out to sea by Thai authorities. A recent CNN investigation found evidence of such activity. Photos obtained by CNN include one that shows the Thai army towing a boatload of some 190 refugees.  Watch Dan Rivers' BackStory on the investigation » . CNN also interviewed a refugee who said he was one of the few who had survived after a group of six rickety boats was towed back to sea and abandoned by Thai authorities earlier this month. The Thai government has launched an inquiry. The Thai army has denied the allegations. But after extensive questioning by CNN, one source in the Thai military confirmed that the Thai army was operating a dump-at-sea policy. The source defended it, saying that each boatload of refugees is given sufficient supplies of food and water. That source said Thai villagers had become afraid of the hundreds of Rohingya arriving each month, and they had accused the refugees of stealing their property and threatening them. The Thai government has said that ""there is no reasonable ground to believe"" that the Rohingya are fleeing Myanmar because of persecution. ""Their profile and their seasonal travel further support the picture that they are illegal migrants, and not those requiring international protection,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued Tuesday. One of the refugees who came ashore Tuesday said they will be killed if returned to Myanmar because of their minority status. He said the Rohingya are stateless because they lack bribe money to obtain identification cards in Myanmar. In Tuesday's statement, the Thai government said it deals with all illegal migrants in accordance with its laws and international guidelines. It said ""basic humanitarian needs"" such as food and water are met among the migrants before they are returned home. Their boats also are fixed, officials said. The Thai government said that ""accepting those arriving in an irregular manner would simply encourage new arrivals."" The government denied media reports alleging that Thai authorities mistreat the illegal migrants and intentionally damage their boats.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Babies lie side by side in warming beds or sprawled on blankets atop crude wooden tables. Many families at Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, seem resigned to the situation. Children with wounds and broken bones are carried in by their parents to wait on stiff plastic chairs. Outside, coughing youngsters squat on the pavement with their anxious families, waiting for care. And everywhere, parents clutch plastic bags containing bring-your-own medicines and supplies. For though they are all awaiting treatment at Afghanistan's only specialist pediatric hospital, the hospital cannot even afford bandages for its patients. The Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital in central Kabul has to run on an operating budget of less than $1,200 a month, said Dr. Noorulhaq Yousufzai, the hospital director. The few supplies that he can buy have to be hoarded for emergencies, and he has to count on parents to buy what's needed to care for their children. ""In some cases, there is shortage of the surgical materials, and sometimes we don't have antiseptic to use,"" Yousufzai said. The United Nations says that more than $15 billion in aid has been sent to Afghanistan since the U.S.-led coalition overthrew the Taliban in late 2001. But still, the hospital cannot afford to help the hundreds of children who stream in every day, desperate for care and cures. The government does pay for salaries and sometimes for fuel, but there is often a shortage of even basic supplies like syringes. Doctors say they have to double up premature babies in incubators. And some of those incubators are compromised. On a recent day, a plastic surgical mask taped onto one machine was the only shield from infection.  Watch scenes from inside the hospital » . The parents waiting anxiously beside their sick children seem resigned to the situation in the hospital. One mother, who declined to give her name, said she spent the family's entire weekly income of $8 on an injection that did not help her baby. ""This is something that the hospital should be giving us, because we can't afford it,"" she said. The U.S. Agency for International Development says infant mortality has dropped by 22 percent since the overthrow of the Taliban but acknowledges that the health status for Afghans is among the worst in the world. One in every five Afghan children will die before their 5th birthday, often of a preventable disease, according to the Save the Children aid agency. The toll on the children and parents is clear to any visitor, and the strain hits the hospital staff, too. ""When you see a patient is very, very, sick and you cannot help, and they have to provide something for their children and they are not able to provide, it's also a stress for us,"" Yousufzai said. At the end of 2001, there were hopes that the hospital would be upgraded, but it is still waiting. It needs some acute care of its own, or it will continue to struggle to help the children who arrive at its door pleading for care.","Kabul hospital's operating budget is less than $1,200 a month .

"(CNN) -- Madagascar's military handed over the reins of the island nation to opposition leader Andry Rajoelina on Wednesday, ending a two-month long political crisis -- but apparently creating a constitutional one. Andry Rajoelina is six years too young to be Madagascar's president under its constitution. Rajoelina, a former disc jockey turned mayor of Madagascar's capital, declared himself president of a transitional government and his supporters pledged to hold elections in two years. But Rajoelina, at 34, is six years too young to be president, according to the country's constitution. Also, the constitution says the head of parliament's upper house must call elections within two months if something happens to the president. Madagascar's former president, Marc Ravalomanana, ceded power to his military Tuesday after insisting over the weekend that he would remain in control. Analysts think Ravalomanana had little choice but to step down once he had lost much of the army's support. The African Union had warned that any power transfer aided by the military would amount to a coup d' etat. The Union has since removed any mention of a coup in its official communique and called on the transitional government to ""comply scrupulously with the provisions of the constitution of Madagascar on interim arrangements."" Monja Roindefo, the opposition-appointed prime minister, vigorously defended the week's developments on the island, located off the southeastern coast of Africa. ""Well, we would like to define what is a coup,"" he told CNN on Wednesday. ""A coup is a group of people or persons who takes the power on behalf of sovereignty, on behalf of the people ... when the representative democracy doesn't work anymore."" ""As you know, as stated, in the African Union charter, the people have the right to defend itself from an oppression or a dictatorship in Africa,"" he added. Roindefo said the new government will hold elections but has given itself two years to clean up the process.  Watch more from iReporters and Twitterers on the crisis » . ""How could you make an election immediately?"" he said. ""We need to reform the electoral commission. ... So the 24 months that we have given ourselves is to prepare all these types of elections in order to build a genuine democratic country."" The African Union also asked that all steps be taken to ensure the safety of the former president. The opposition leader had called for Ravalomanana's arrest, accusing him of corruption, financial mismanagement and dictatorship. Ravalomanana was first elected in 2001 and won a second term in 2006. To many Malagasy, he represented a new breed of politician -- a self-made millionaire, a no-nonsense business leader. But Ravalomanana maintained his business empire while in office and it was unclear to many where his business interests ended and his political leadership began. His recent purchase of a $60 million airplane further stoked public discontent. Opposition leader Rajoelina was quick to seize on the sentiments and made fiery appeals to the country's impoverished masses. The country was plunged into political instability in January after thousands of people took to the streets to protest rising food prices and what they perceived as autocratic behavior by Ravalomanana. The protests soon degenerated into rioting and looting, and left about 100 people dead.  Watch more on president's resignation » . Soon after, Rajoelina declared that he was in charge of the country. He gave Ravalomanana until early February to step down. The president responded by firing Rajoelina as mayor of the capital, inciting the latter's supporters to once again descend on the streets. More deadly violence followed. Clashes spread to most provincial capitals and other cities across the country, with homes and businesses looted and burned, the U.S. State Department reported. CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","Madagascar military hands power to opposition leader Andry Rajoelina .

"(CNN)  -- Josef Fritzl, the Austrian accused of keeping his daughter in a cellar for decades and fathering her seven children, will plead guilty to rape and incest when his trial opens Monday, Fritzl's lawyer told CNN. Josef Fritzl is expected to plead guilty to rape and incest on Monday, his lawyer tells CNN. However, Fritzl will deny other charge he faces: murder, enslavement and assault, attorney Rudolph Mayer said Sunday. The 73-year-old expects to spend the rest of his life in prison, Mayer added. Fritzl faces six charges in a closed-door trial. The trial is scheduled to last five days, but Mayer said it could be shorter. Fritzl was charged in November with incest and the repeated rape of his daughter, Elisabeth, over a 24-year period. But he was also charged with the murder of one of the children he fathered with her, an infant who died soon after birth. State Prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek said Michael Fritzl died from lack of medical care. In all, Fritzl is charged with: murder, involvement in slave trade (slavery), rape, incest, assault and deprivation of liberty, Sedlacek's office said. If convicted, he could face life in prison. Austria does not have the death penalty. ""This man obviously led a double life for 24 years. He had a wife and had seven kids with her. And then he had another family with his daughter, fathered another seven children with her,"" said Franz Polzer, a police officer in Amstetten, the town where Fritzl lived, at the time of his arrest. The case first came to light in April 2008 when Elisabeth's daughter, Kerstin, became seriously ill with convulsions. Elisabeth persuaded her father to allow Kerstin, then 19, to be taken to a hospital for treatment. Hospital staff became suspicious of the case and alerted police, who discovered the family members in the cellar. Fritzl confessed to police that he raped his daughter, kept her and their children in captivity and burned the body of the dead infant in an oven in the house. Elisabeth told police the infant was one of twins who died a few days after birth. When Elisabeth gained her freedom, she told police her father began sexually abusing her at age 11. On August 8, 1984, she told police, her father enticed her into the basement, where he drugged her, put her in handcuffs and locked her in a room. Fritzl explained Elisabeth's disappearance in 1984 by saying the girl, who was then 18, had run away from home. He backed up the story with letters he forced Elisabeth to write. Elisabeth Fritzl and all but three of her children lived in the specially designed cellar beneath her father's home in Amstetten, Austria, west of Vienna. The other three children lived upstairs with Fritzl and his wife; Fritzl had left them on his own doorstep, pretending the missing Elisabeth had dropped them off. Under Austrian law, if Fritzl is convicted on several offenses, he will be given the sentence linked to the worst crime. The charges he faces are: . • Murder: The infant who died in 1996 died from a lack of medical care, the state prosecutor said. The charge carries a sentence of life in prison. • Involvement in slave trade: From 1984 until 2008, prosecutors allege, Fritzl held his daughter, Elisabeth, captive in a dungeon, abused her sexually and treated her as if she were his personal property -- in a situation similar to slavery. If he is convicted, the sentence could range from 10 to 20 years in prison. • Rape: Between August 30, 1984, and June 30, 1989, Fritzl ""regularly sexually abused Elisabeth,"" according to the prosecutor. The sentence could be from five to 15 years in prison. • Incest: Parallel to the rape charge. It carries a sentence of up to one year. • Withdrawal of liberty: Three of the children Fritzl had with Elisabeth were illegally held captive in a dungeon with no daylight or fresh air, according to prosecutors. That charge carries a sentence of one to 10 years. • Assault: Between August 28, 1984, and April 26, 2006, Fritzl repeatedly threatened Elisabeth and their three children with gas and booby traps as warnings in case they tried to escape, authorities allege. The sentence would range from six months to five years.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- FIFA will announce its Player of the Year for 2008 at a ceremony in Zurich today, and here is a look at the leading contenders for the award. Favorite: Portugal and Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo is in line for the FIFA award. To see the full list of contenders for the prize and vote for who you think should win, click here. Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United, Portugal) Ronaldo has emerged as favorite for the award after he and his Manchester United club enjoyed a superb season. The Portugal international was a central figure in the club's English Premier League, UEFA Champions League and World Club Championships titles. He scored 42 goals in the season. Critics would say he didn't perform well enough on the international stage, as Portugal exited at the quarter-final stage of Euro 2008, and Ronaldo was disappointing. However, he has already picked up the Ballon d'Or award for Europe's player of the year, and for the previous three years the winner of this has gone on to claim the FIFA prize (Ronaldinho, Fabio Cannavaro and Kaka). Lionel Messi (Barcelona, Argentina) Messi appears to be Ronaldo's main challenger for the prize -- if public opinion matters, anyway. Messi won an Olympic gold medal with Argentina and made a stunning start to the current season with Barcelona. In the Primera Liga his 10 goals early in the season helped open up a significant gap on the side's main rivals, and he has also scored five goals in the UEFA Champions League season. The 21-year-old is often compared to Argentina's legendary Diego Maradona. Fernando Torres (Liverpool, Spain) The Spaniard enjoyed an incredible first season in the Premier League -- scoring 24 league goals for Liverpool -- a new record for a foreign striker in his debut season. After that success he went on to Austria-Switzerland and played an integral part in Spain's Euro 2008 victory, scoring the winning goal in the final. If top-level international performances are the key to this award then Torres should go close. Iker Casillas (Real Madrid, Spain) Casillas was recently awarded the Best Keeper of the World in 2008 title by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics. Casillas played a large part in helping his Real Madrid side to the Spanish La Liga title, put in strong performances in the UEFA Champions League, and was a key part of Spain's Euro 2008-winning team. Xavi Hernandez (Barcelona, Spain) Also part of the Spanish team which won Euro 2008, Xavi claimed the Player of the Tournament award, which would make him a worthy winner of the FIFA Player of the Year. Aside from his stunning performances at Euro, Xavi scored seven goals for Barcelona last season, and was one of their standout players, while this season he has continued his good form and helped Barcelona to the top of La Liga.","FIFA will announce its Player of the Year for 2008 in Zurich Monday evening .

She and husband Shane Deary have tried reading to their tot. ""We do read [him] books, and he has his favorites, but right now it's very much like 'Read this one, read this one.' And we read the first two pages, then he's like, 'and now this one.' I'm like 'But we haven't gotten to the best part! Let me finish.' It's a lot of that.""

Russell offers a reason why some entertainers choose distinctive names for their children: It's the nature of their work. ""It's an unusual life. I mean, so there tend to be creative people, and maybe people are more creative with their names, too,"" she says. ""Or [they] feel like they don't have to be so confined to tradition because it's such an untraditional line of work.""","Keri Russell stars in new Adam Sandler film ""Bedtime Stories""

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- The Mexican military has arrested the son of a top drug cartel lieutenant, the government said Thursday. Authorities present suspect Vicente Zambada Niebla to the press Thursday in Mexico City. Vicente Zambada Niebla, known as ""El Vicentillo,"" was arrested Wednesday along with five subordinates, Mexico's defense department and attorney general's office said in a joint release. The men were acting suspiciously and had military-grade weapons, officials said. Zambada is the son of Ismael Zambada García, known as ""El Mayo."" The elder Zambada is a top lieutenant in the Sinaloa cartel, headed by Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, officials said. Senior defense official Luis Arturo Oliver Cen and Jose Ricardo Cabrera Gutierrez, a top official with an attorney general's task force on terrorism and security, announced the arrest in Mexico City. Guzman, the alleged cartel leader who escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001, was named in this year's Forbes magazine report on the world's billionaires. He ranked 701. Authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border blame Sinaloa and other cartels for a surge in violence in the region. Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora expressed outrage at Forbes for listing a major drug suspect. About 6,500 people died in the drug war in Mexico last year, Mexican President Felipe Calderon said last week. Defense official Oliver said authorities confiscated three rifles, three luxury automobiles, 67,480 pesos ($4,845) and $866 in U.S. currency. A video on the Universal newspaper Web site shows a dark-haired Zambada and other men being led away in handcuffs. Zambada sports long sideburns, beard stubble, a black sports coat and a striped shirt.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A ship laden with toxic substances is due to arrive in northeast England for recycling Sunday, ending an odyssey that has seen it turned away from at least three other countries. The scrapping of the aircraft carrier has been hugely controversial and a major headache for France. The French Navy spent years looking for a site that would decommission the former aircraft carrier Clemenceau, now known simply as the Q790. The ship contains asbestos, which can cause cancer. Greenpeace activists boarded the ship off the coast of Egypt in 2006 to prevent it being sent to India to be scrapped. The environmental campaign group said at the time it contained ""high levels of asbestos and other hazardous materials."" Two activists climbed the ship's masts and hung banners reading ""Absestos carrier: stay out of India."" The group declared ""victory"" a month later when then-President Jacques Chirac of France recalled the ship after the country's Council of State ruled its export could violate European law, Greenpeace said. The ship had earlier been rejected by Turkey and Greece, after the original plan to turn it into an artificial reef was scrapped for environmental reasons, the group said. The British ship recycling company that will scrap it had to apply for special permission from the country's Environment Agency and Health and Safety Executive. But the company, Able Ship Recycling, hailed its arrival in the English city of Hartlepool as a milestone. ""The dismantling of the vessel will be the largest ship recycling project ever undertaken in Europe,"" the company said in a statement. The work will take place at the company's Teesside Environmental Reclamation and Recycling Centre, where it will produce about 200 jobs in the economically depressed region. Able chairman and chief executive Peter Stephenson said the contract was ""crucially important... at a time when there are so many economic problems facing the world -- and especially a region such as the north-east of England."" ""Recycling the Q790 will be the largest project so far handled by any European yard but, with the biggest dry dock in the world, we have the capacity to undertake the recycling of the vessel,"" he added. Launched in 1957, the Clemenceau was the mainstay of the French naval fleet and sailed over a million nautical miles before being withdrawn from active service after almost four decades at sea, the company said. It will join the other three UK and four U.S. vessels also being recycled at the center, Able said. Greenpeace is not opposing the transfer of the ship to England, but press reports suggest local activists are displeased.","French ship laden with toxic substances is to arrive in UK for recycling .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Democrats' top investigator in Congress reacted angrily Friday to a report that the former Blackwater USA employee accused of killing an Iraqi vice presidential guard was hired by another U.S. contractor weeks later. Rep. Henry Waxman says the State Department is covering up ""an epidemic of corruption"" in Iraq. The report comes alongside Rep. Henry Waxman's warning of a ""confrontation"" with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice over how much Americans should be able to learn about corruption in Iraq. In a sharply worded letter,  Waxman demanded Rice turn over a long list of documents related to the contractor, Andrew Moonen. ""Serious questions now exist about whether the State Department may have withheld from the U.S. Defense Department facts about this Blackwater contractor's shooting of the Iraqi guard that should have prevented his hiring to work on another contract in support of the Iraq War,"" wrote Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Moonen is accused of fatally shooting an Iraqi guard and fleeing the scene, according to a Congressional memo describing the investigation report. He was fined, fired and flown home from Iraq, and the company later paid $20,000 in compensation to the victim's family.  Moonen returned to the United States within a few days of the incident, his attorney said, but in February he returned to Kuwait working for Combat Support Associates (CSA), a company spokesman said. CNN reported Thursday night that CSA said it was unaware of the December incident when it hired Moonen, because the State Department and Blackwater kept the incident quiet and out of Moonen's personnel records.  Waxman wrote it is ""hard to reconcile this development"" with previous assertions State Department officials have made in recent days.   Waxman earlier accused Rice and the State Department of a cover-up of what he called ""an epidemic of corruption"" in Iraq in general. He branded the State Department's anti-corruption efforts ""dysfunctional, under-funded and a low priority."" Waxman further blasted the department for trying to keep secret details of corruption in Iraq, especially relating to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. ""Corruption is increasing in Iraq, and the State Department can't keep us from knowing that -- can't censor that -- just because it might embarrass or hurt our relationship with [al-]Maliki,"" Waxman said at the House committee hearing.  Watch Waxman ask why negative comments must be said behind closed doors » . Deputy Secretary of State Larry Butler repeatedly refused to answer questions from Waxman about Iraqi corruption but offered full disclosure if his testimony would be kept secret. Asked if he believes the Iraqi government has the political will or the capability to root out corruption, Butler responded, ""Mr. Chairman, questions which go to the broad nature of our bilateral relationship with Iraq are best answered in a classified setting."" But he was more forthcoming when talking about efforts that al-Maliki has taken to improve matters, commending the prime minister for dispatching Iraqi forces to surround a refinery to ensure oil did not end up on the black market. But Waxman appeared unmoved. ""Why can you talk about the positive things and not the negative things?"" he asked. ""Shouldn't we have the whole picture?"" ""I'd be very pleased to answer those questions in an appropriate setting,"" Butler replied. Waxman laughed and asked, ""An appropriate setting for positive things is a congressional hearing, but for negative things, it must be behind closed doors?"" ""As you know, this goes to the very heart of diplomatic relations and national security,"" Butler said. ""It goes to the very heart of propaganda,"" Waxman said, putting funding for anti-corruption activities through June 15, 2006, at $65 million, ""or less than 0.003 percent of the total"" spent by the Iraqi Relief and Reconstruction Fund. The State Department said details of anti-corruption efforts must be secret to protect investigators and Iraqi allies. In a letter to Rice last week, Waxman called the department's position ""ludicrous."" Fellow Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky agreed. ""It's pretty clear that the administration just wants to muzzle any comments that reflect negatively on the [al-]Maliki government,"" he said. Earlier, the former head of the Iraqi Commission on Public Integrity, Judge Radhi Hamza al-Radhi, told the hearing that al-Maliki had protected family members from corruption investigations, citing Salam al-Maliki, Iraq's former transportation minister and the prime minister's cousin. Al-Radhi resigned last month and fled Iraq after he and his family were attacked and 31 of his anti-corruption employees were killed. He said corruption has affected ""virtually every agency and ministry, including some of the most powerful officials in Iraq."" ""Corruption has stopped possible advances by the government on the political level, on economic reconstruction, on basic services, amenities and infrastructure and on the rule of law,"" he told the committee, estimating the total lost to corruption at $18 billion. In Baghdad, Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh acknowledged his country is plagued with a ""high level"" of corruption, but he said officials are trying to rein in the problem. U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, head of the Government Accountability Office, said there appeared to be no U.S. plan for countering the corruption. He urged Congress to consider conditioning future appropriations on such a plan ""so we can achieve some results rather than have just more efforts."" Waxman questioned whether Iraq's government was ""too corrupt to succeed."" If so, he added, ""We need to ask if we could, in good conscience, continue to ... prop up his regime.""

The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: You knew Natasha Richardson. What was your reaction? Joan Rivers: Oh, [it] shouldn't have happened.

Rivers: We were all in the Caribbean, and we all kind of knew each other from dinner parties and so forth. And we met at the airport, and we said, ""Oh, let's get together, with the kids."" And it was one of those wonderful days. We laughed and talked and had lunch, and the kids were jumping off the boat and we were drinking wine. She was just amazing and darling. King: Have you seen her work on Broadway? Rivers: I've seen her work. I love actresses who go back and forth. I always have such great respect for someone who goes to Broadway and then film and goes back again. I saw her in ""The Philadelphia Story"" years ago in London when she won an award. She was very young in a musical version of that. King: What was your read on them as a couple that day? Rivers: Totally happy, totally devoted to each other. That's what kills me.

And I swear to you, I laid on the ground and I go, ""If everything works, that's it. That's it."" King: You've heard the doctor. What do you make of this? There must have been something previously.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- California corrections officials released an updated prison photograph of Charles Manson on Wednesday, showing the balding and graying 74-year-old, complete with his iconic forehead swastika. A new photo of Charles Manson shows his graying beard and his legendary swastika tattooed into his forehead. The picture was taken as part of a regular update of inmate images at the California State Prison in Corcoran, about 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles, where Manson is serving a life term. The release of the picture comes ahead of the 40th anniversary of the ""Manson family"" killings in August 1969. Manson and four others -- Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Charles ""Tex"" Watson and Leslie Van Houten -- were convicted of murder and other charges in connection with a two-night rampage that left pregnant actress Sharon Tate and seven others dead. Van Houten, who was 19 at the time of the killings, was convicted in the murders of Leno LaBianca, a wealthy grocery store owner, and his wife, Rosemary. Van Houten was accused of stabbing Rosemary LaBianca 14 to 16 times in the back. Van Houten was also convicted of conspiracy in Tate's death and four others at the actress' Beverly Hills home. Tate was 8½ months pregnant, and the baby also died in the attack. Manson, Atkins and Krenwinkel were convicted for those murders. All members of the ""Manson family"" have been up for parole multiple times over the past four decades, but it has never been granted. Atkins, who has been declared terminally ill, was denied a compassionate release from prison in July 2008.  Atkins has told police she was one of the people who stabbed Tate and scrawled the word ""pig"" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director Roman Polanski. In May 2008, authorities dug for bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police learned that testing had indicated human remains might be buried there. According to authorities, nothing was found.","Prison officials release updated photo of convicted murderer Charles Manson .

"(CNN) -- Actress Natasha Richardson died of injuries caused by blunt impact to the head, the New York City Medical Examiner's Office confirmed Thursday. Natasha Richardson fell on a beginners' ski slope in Canada. The death was ruled an accident, the office said. Paramedics dispatched to help Richardson minutes after she fell on a Canadian ski slope Monday were turned away and did not have a chance to check her injury, the ambulance service director told a Toronto, Canada, newspaper. Richardson -- a film star, Tony-winning stage actress and member of the famed Redgrave acting family -- died two days later in a New York hospital from a head injury suffered at a Quebec resort about 80 miles northwest of Montreal. Yves Coderre, operations director for Ambulances Radisson, told Toronto's The Globe and Mail newspaper on Wednesday that his company sent an ambulance to the slopes at Mont Tremblant Ski Resort after a call from the ski patrol. ""They never saw the patient,"" Coderre said. ""So they turned around.""  Watch how brain injuries can be hidden » . Coderre did not say who sent the ambulance away. Efforts by CNN to reach Coderre have been unsuccessful. A resort spokeswoman said a statement was being prepared in response to the latest report. An earlier statement from the resort said a paramedic from its ski patrol ""arrived on the scene within minutes"" after Richardson, 45, fell during a lesson on a beginners' trail. The ski patrol paramedic ""did not find any visible sign of injury,"" it said. ""As standard protocol, the ski patrol insisted Ms. Richardson be transported to the base of the hill in a rescue toboggan,"" it said. ""Once at the base of the hill, Ms. Richardson was advised by staff to consider seeking additional medical attention which was declined."" The resort's statement said Richardson, accompanied by her instructor, returned to her hotel but about an hour after the fall was ""not feeling good,"" the statement said. Another ambulance was later called to the hotel, where paramedics found her conscious, but she ""wasn't in good shape,"" Coderre said. Richardson was taken to a local hospital before being transferred to Hopital du Sacre-Coeur in Montreal. From there she was transferred to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. She and her husband, actor Liam Neeson, have two children, Michael and Daniel. Her family issued a short statement Wednesday night acknowledging her death. ""Liam Neeson, his sons, and the entire family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Natasha. They are profoundly grateful for the support, love and prayers of everyone, and ask for privacy during this very difficult time."" Richardson is a member of acting royalty. Her grandfather, Sir Michael Redgrave, was a famed British actor.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- More than 1,000 people rallied Sunday in support of Israel in front of the Israeli Embassy in the Spanish capital. Spaniards protest Sunday in support of Israel's military action in Gaza. The rally came a week after a demonstration across town in support of Palestinians in Gaza and sharply critical of Israel's attacks. Sunday's pro-Israeli demonstration featured the sounding of air raid sirens -- like those heard in southern Israel to warn of incoming Hamas rockets from Gaza -- and a speech by a Madrid official from the ruling Socialist Party, observers said. Last week's pro-Gaza, anti-Israeli demonstration included two national leaders of the Socialists, prompting a rare statement from the Israeli Embassy criticizing their participation. But the Socialist government and the Israeli Embassy appeared to have mended fences during the week, issuing conciliatory statements. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos visited the Mideast last week, with stops in Syria, Egypt and Israel, where he was received by top officials. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero was in Egypt Sunday, attending the meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh organized by Egypt and France.

Six years later, the conflict in Iraq drags on -- with war-fatigued Americans shoving the military operation to the deep recesses of their psyches as they grapple with an economic crisis at home. Only 10 percent of voters questioned in exit polls during the November presidential elections picked the war as their top issue. Sixty-two percent said the economy was. ""This is already one of the longest wars in American history. There's nothing new in Iraq,"" said Steven Roberts, a professor of media studies at the George Washington University. ""We've read the stories of instability in the government a hundred times. Every single possible story has been told, and so there is enormous fatigue about Iraq."" Against that backdrop, the United States has accomplished much of what it set out to do when it invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was deposed, captured, tried and hanged for a brutal and deadly crackdown against his opponents during his regime. The rate of U.S. troop deaths has slowed. A surge of 30,000 additional troops in 2007 is credited for security gains the country has made. iReport.com: Share your salute to troops . And a fledgling democracy is taking hold, as President Obama announced that all U.S troops will be withdrawn by the end of 2011. But America has had to pay a steep price -- literally and figuratively -- to achieve its aims, analysts say. Taking into account operations for fiscal 2010, the conflict has racked up an $800 billion price tag since it began, the Congressional Budget Office said. By Wednesday, 4,261 Americans had been killed in the war, according to CNN's tally. The Iraqi casualty count, while harder to ascertain because of the lack of formal record-keeping, has reached at least 128,000, by CNN's tally. And leaked images of prisoner abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison and America's programs of detention and torture have tarred the United States' image internationally. ""From the first step until now, they destroyed our country,"" said Sheikh Moffaq Qaraghuli, a Baghdad resident. ""Smashed. Not destroyed. Smashed."" As the battles rage on, researchers are still trying to gauge the damage the war has done to troops. ""I still have the nightmares and wake up and find myself downstairs and I don't know how I got there,"" said Chris Tucker, who did three tours of duty in Iraq. ""Faces. Kids' faces. People that you have engaged or you have had contact with. ... You see your colleagues blown up. Things like that."" ""I thought we would get there quick and handle our business and we'd be out,"" he said. ""At least that's what we were told anyway."" Tucker received a medical discharge from the army last year and is now a police officer in Savannah, Georgia. Many in Iraq also are trying to move on, amid the constant fear of suicide attacks in their ruined cities. The Shahbander cafe, one of Baghdad's oldest, is a favorite haunt of the city's intellectuals. Inside, photographs of five young men hang on the wall.  Watch Shahbander Cafe patrons talk about the war » . All were sons of the cafe owner, Mohammed al-Khishali -- killed in a car bombing that ripped apart the cafe in 2007. A month later, al-Khishali lost his grief-stricken wife. For almost two years, he could not bear to reopen the cafe, he said. ""I remember the tragedies every day,"" he said, as his eyes welled with tears. ""But then I decided to take a hard decision to reopen this cafe for the sake of my people, my culture."" Many of the customers who gather there are critical of the U.S. invasion but are equally concerned about a potential withdrawal. ""Iran has ambitions toward Iraq,"" said Amer Naji, a cafe regular and a former Iraqi diplomat. ""With the Americans, they are afraid to do something aggressive against Iraq. But ... when you withdraw, that will be very dangerous."" Iraq and Iran fought a war in the 1980s that spanned eight years and killed at least a half-million people, by some estimates. The U.S. and Iraqi governments think Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard has been training militias and providing weapons, such as roadside bombs, to insurgents operating in Iraq. So, though many Iraqis agree that 2009 is better than 2008, they worry about 2011 when the United States pulls out. ""We are hopeless,"" Qaraghuli said. ""We are hopeless.""

"(CNN) -- Havana has a thriving cultural scene and is the setting for world-class ballet and film festivals. But it's also a city of music, sunshine and rum, and Havana knows how to throw a damn fine party. Here are some of the city's biggest and best annual events. Dancers parade along the Malecon for the Havana Carnival. May Day (May 1) Hundreds of thousands of cheering people march through Havana to celebrate International Workers' Day. This quintessentially Cuban event offers a fascinating insight into a country where politics is woven into every aspect of daily life. Marching Cubans carry placards past images of communist heroes like Marx and Lenin in Plaza de la Revolucion square. The fact that the whole occasion is carefully stage managed by party officials adds to its uniquely Cuban air. Havana Carnival (August)  One fiesta just isn't enough for a city like Havana, so the Cuban capital has two annual carnivals. There's the smaller event in February, which is well worth checking out, but to experience the real deal you're better off waiting until summer. Crowds pack the Malecon in the final two weeks of July and the first two weeks of August to hear some of the island's finest musicians performing al fresco. The final weekend sees a colossal parade make its way from Habana Vieja to the Malecon in a swirling mass of conga lines, skimpy outfits, music and dancing -- accompanied by lashings of rum. Look out too for the ""Munecones"", huge satirical figures of various famous faces, accompanied by the ""faroleros"", dancers who twirl brightly colored standards as they parade along the Malecon. See Carlos Acosta's Havana » . The International Havana Ballet Festival ( October/November, every other year)  This festival brings together international stars and prestigious companies from around the world, as well as showcasing the renowned National Ballet of Cuba, which has produced the likes of Alicia Alonso and Carlos Acosta. The festival has showcased more than 200 world premieres and performances range from classics like Swan Lake to challenging modern pieces. One of the highlights of the festival is the choice of venues, ranging from the faded grandeur of the Gran Teatro de La Habana, the city's opera house, to open-air performances in Old Havana, where the subtly-lit facades of colonial palaces provide a wonderfully romantic backdrop. What do you think are Havana's seasonal highlights? Let us know below. Havana Jazz Festival (Winter) Cuban music has played a huge role in the development of jazz, with musicians like Chano Pozo exporting Cuban rhythms to the U.S. to create the fusion known as Latin Jazz. Cuban jazz maestro and five-time Grammy winner Chucho Valdes organizes the festival and is a regular performer, along with a host of international names. Past events have featured the likes of Dizzy Gillespie and Max Roach and the present-day lack of U.S. stars is more than made up for by an impressive contingent of Latin American talent. There are performances at The Hotel Rivera, Casa de la Cultura Plaza, Teatro Nacional de Cuba, Teatro Amadeo Roldán and various smoky clubs. Although the jazz festival is usually held in December, the 2009 event took place in February, so if you're planning a visit be sure to check the dates well in advance. The Festival of New Latin American Cinema (December) This 10-day festival is one of the biggest events in Latin American film, which is currently producing some of the finest cinema in the world. Movie buffs from all over the island flock to see an impressive selection of movies, ranging from Spanish-language blockbusters to obscure art flicks. Even if your Spanish isn't good enough to fully understand the films being shown, the festival still offers the chance for a bit of celeb spotting. Past attendees have included the likes of Robert de Niro, Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, Steven Spielberg and Pedro Almodovar.","Hundreds of thousands march through Havana on International Workers' Day .

"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people packed a soccer stadium in Cameroon Thursday, including President Paul Biya and his wife, for the first large-scale mass of Pope Benedict XVI's first visit to Africa. Tens of thousands of people gathered at a football stadium in Cameroon to see the pope. Africa is the last continent that Benedict had left to visit, and one he could not avoid, said David Gibson, a biographer of the pope. ""He knows he has to do this. He knows Africa is the future of the (Roman Catholic) Church, as it is for all of Christianity,"" said Gibson. Christianity, like Islam, is on the rise in Africa and Latin America, even as the northern hemisphere tends to become more secular."" One in five of the world's Christians lives in Africa -- up from less than one in fifty in 1900, said Brian Grim, an editor of the World Religion Database. So Benedict is making the visit although travel ""is not his cup of tea,"" Gibson said. ""John Paul II loved the travel and loved the different cultures. Benedict is a European through and through.""  Watch the pope at the soccer stadium » . But Benedict understands that travel has become an essential part of a pope's duties, said Gibson, the author of ""The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World."" Benedict drew cheers at the mass at the 40,000-seat Amadou Ahidjo Stadium when he told worshippers that God had not forgotten orphans, poor and abused children, and those ""forced to join paramilitary forces,"" Cameroon TV reported. He did not mention condoms, a subject which sparked controversy when he reiterated the Vatican's opposition to artificial birth control Monday while flying to Cameroon. Sub-Saharan Africa has been hit harder by AIDS and HIV than any other region of the world, according to the United Nations and World Health Organization. There has been fierce debate between those who advocate the use of condoms to help stop the spread of the epidemic and those who oppose it. The pope's mention of birth control may have been an effort to draw attention to the trip, which ""is not getting much of a bounce in the Western media,"" Gibson speculated. ""They are savvy enough to know that if the pope mentions condoms, it is going to be a headline,"" he said of the pontiff's advisers. The issue did not come up by chance, he pointed out. ""These were pre-selected questions for which they had prepared answers,"" he said. The pope also Thursday met local Muslim leaders in Cameroon, a west African country which is just over one-quarter Roman Catholic and just under one-quarter Muslim. Both religions are expanding rapidly in Africa, said Grim, a senior research fellow in religion and world affairs at the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. Less than one in ten people in sub-Saharan Africa was Christian in 1900. Today nearly six in ten are, he said. The region was about 14 percent Muslim at the beginning of the 20th century, he said, and about 30 percent Muslim now. Benedict outraged Muslim leaders around the world in 2006 by quoting the 15th-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus when he said, ""Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached."" He repeatedly apologized for the citation, which he said did not reflect his own views. ""It was a painful lesson but clearly the pope learned something from that,"" Gibson said. The pope's meeting Muslim leaders in person can help relations between the Church and Islam, the analyst added. Face-to-face encounters make ""the pope a human figure. That's what these trips are really about -- to see that the pope is not the boogeyman, he is someone who is kind and wise and wants to discuss issues. ""It's so easy to see caricatures, so for the pope simply to show up can be an enormously positive development,"" Gibson said. Gibson said this week's visit may be Benedict's only trip to Africa. ""Knowing that the pope is older, he cannot travel as much -- he does not like to travel -- makes these trips more poignant. He may never come back to Africa again.""","Tens of thousands of people pack soccer stadium in Cameroon for pope's mass .

"(CNN) -- What's happening in Madagascar? Supporters of opposition leader Andry Rajoelina attend a rally in Antananarivo on Monday. Marc Ravalomanana resigned as Madagascar's president after weeks of bitter and deadly political clashes. The military handed power to Andry Rajoelina, the 34-year-old former mayor of Antananarivo. Rajoelina and Ravalomanana have been engaged in a bitter power struggle since the beginning of the year. Despite vowing that he would never give up power without an election or referendum, Ravalomanana fled his presidential palace. The army later stormed the abandoned palace as a show of support for Rajoelina. Analysts believe that Ravalomanana had little choice but to step down once he lost the army's support. The power grab ended a chaotic few days in the island nation. Though Rajoelina's supporters say he is now in charge, the dust has not yet settled. Is this a Coup, as the African Union has suggested, or is this a popular expression of the people? Why did this happen? Trouble has been brewing in Madagascar since January, when Ravalomanana sacked Rajoelina from his post in the capital. Rajoelina, a former DJ and media entrepreneur, tapped into rising frustration in the country over high food prices and service delivery to rally support against the president. He set up a parallel government and led massive street protests against his rival. Over 100 people were killed in the protests, culminating in a demonstration outside the presidential palace in February when a further 23 were killed. Reports suggest most were killed by the security forces. While Rajoelina has tapped into popular discontent, Madagascar watchers say that to call this a popular revolution over simplifies the takeover. ""I think at first Ravalomanana was quite popular with the people but he treated the political elite with disdain,"" said historian Stephen Ellis. This made him enemies within the country. Ravalomanana v. Rajoelina -- are they that different? Ravalomanana made his fortune in business and has interests in several media outlets. He came to the fore politically in 1999 when he was appointed mayor of Antananarivo. Rajoelina gained prominence as a DJ and also has interests in several media businesses. He too gained political traction by becoming the mayor of Antananarivo. Both men gained popular support by reaching out to the masses as a leader for the youth of Madagascar. Ravalomanana was first elected president in 2001 and won a second term in 2006. To many Malagasy he represented a new breed of politician-a self-made millionaire, a no-nonsense business leader. But Ravalomanana maintained his business empire while in office and it was unclear to many where his business interests ended and his political leadership began. Rajoelina tapped into the very same strategies of slick marketing and a youthful appeal that Ravalomanana had depended on. Some feel he is just a younger version of the former president. Will the international community recognize the new government? It is unlikely that key members of the international community will rush to support Rajoelina's push into power. ""All of the parties to this conflict need to exercise restraint and resume dialogue,"" said Robert Wood, U.S. State Dept. Spokesman, ""I also want to make clear that any extra constitutional resolution will result in a cut-off of U.S. assistance."" Prior to the takeover, the African Union warned that any power transfer aided by the military would amount to a coup d' état. The AU has since diluted its rhetoric-removing any mention of a coup in its official communiqué on the takeover and calling for the protagonists to ""comply scrupulously with the provisions of the Constitution of Madagascar on interim arrangements."" The crisis in Madagascar is a test for the African Union. Despite purporting to be champion of democracy, recent power grabs in Mauritania and Guinea and the botched elections in Kenya and Zimbabwe, have tested the continental groups claims. Why should you care about Madagascar? Madagascar isn't just a cartoon movie. It is the fourth largest island on the planet with a population of around 20 million, a rich cultural history and breathtaking natural diversity. In the relative stability of the last 8 years, the country's tourism sector has boomed, bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars. However most ordinary Malagasy have not seen any trickle down from the tourism industry. The country remains one of the poorest in the world.","Madagascar military hands power to opposition leader Andry Rajoelina .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- America faces an economic calamity. Trouble brews in faraway lands. Superman #14, cover art. Artist: Fred Ray. (c) 1941 DC Comics. All rights reserved. Sound familiar? More than 70 years ago, the very first superheroes debuted in the dire times of the Great Depression and the early years of World War II. Their names became legend -- Superman, Batman (or, as he was then known, the Bat-Man), Wonder Woman, Captain America -- and they're still with us today. A new exhibit at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles celebrates these icons from the Golden Age of Comic Books. Through a collection of rare original artwork and comics, the exhibit explores how a group of mostly Jewish artists created the costumed heroes who came to symbolize the hopes of a beleaguered nation. ""In the 1930s, the American Dream had become a nightmare, and I think comic books and superheroes in particular provided an escapist form of entertainment that allowed the American public to go into a fantasy world where all the ills of the world were righted by these larger-than-life heroes,"" says Erin Clancy, a curator at the Skirball.  Watch a tour of the exhibit » . Guest curator Jerry Robinson not only organized the exhibit, he's a part of it. The comic book pioneer created Batman's arch-enemy, The Joker, and named the caped crusader's sidekick Robin. (Success has many fathers, of course: Bob Kane, credited with creating Batman, has long disputed elements of Robinson's creation stories.) ""We were just emerging from the Depression,"" Robinson recalls. ""Superman started in 1938. Batman started in 1939. So, we were just recovering."" Robinson says the villains changed with the times. ""The first villains in the comic books were hijackers, embezzlers, bank robbers. It was the era of Pretty Boy Floyd and so forth. Once the war came along, we felt a need for more patriotic heroes to fight Hitler. ""In fact,"" he adds, ""Hitler banned American comics, at least Superman and superheroes. He said they were Jewish. Little did he know that the creators were actually Jewish. ... Hitler banned American comics, except one: Mickey Mouse, which was his favorite."" One of the highlights of the collection is Robinson's original sketch for The Joker. ""My first thought was that a villain who had a sense of humor would be different and memorable,"" he says. ""So, I'm thinking of a name for a villain that has a sense of humor. I thought of 'The Joker' as a name, and as soon as I thought that, I associate it with the playing card, as my family had a tradition of champion playing; my brother was a contract champion bridge player. There were always cards around the house. ""So I searched, and luckily it had the typical image of the joker, which came out of a tradition in Europe. This was an important element. Throughout history, we had court jesters, clowns, and so this was an iconic image that was also very useful."" In our own times, the public is turning to costumed heroes again in record numbers. Movies based on comic books are box office leaders; comic books themselves remain a strong and growing industry. ""I think the comic book superhero came out of a context in which the political, social and economic realties were a little tough,"" Clancy says, ""and we can certainly relate to those realities now in our own day. I think the resurgence of popularity of superheroes can be attributed to that."" Last year, audiences made ""The Dark Knight"" the second-highest grossing film of all time. The late Heath Ledger, who won a best supporting actor Oscar for his performance as The Joker in that film, spoke with Robinson before he died. ""I was flattered to hear from him that he based the whole concept of The Joker's persona and rationale on our first concept of The Joker,"" Robinson says. With the box office success of ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Iron Man"" -- plus comic book-inspired films like ""The First Avenger: Captain America,"" ""The Avengers"" and ""Thor"" in development -- it looks like superheroes will continue to inspire. ""I think heroes are back,"" Robinson says. ""I think you can almost chart it. The times are not so good -- we're looking for heroes."" All images and characters copyright DC Comics.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Samuel Welsh's chances of landing a job before this economic downturn were already slim. Samuel Welsh, laid off since 2006, has found solace in his faith. ""You got to keep God in your heart,"" he said. Now, as a disabled worker, the 29-year-old is competing with thousands of nondisabled job seekers going for jobs once allocated for the disabled population. Welsh was laid off from his job as an executive assistant in 2006. ""I did mortgages, refinances and purchase deals. I was dismissed from that job and after that I was sent over to the Bobby Dodd Institute to do my vocational rehab counseling,"" he said. The Bobby Dodd Institute in Atlanta provides job training and rehabilitation for people with disabilities. Meg Godfrey, an employment specialist with BDI, has been handling Welsh's case. ""He came to us originally looking for a position in administrative clerical type work. We have lowered his goals to greeting and ticket-taking, but those are the first jobs that go in this type of economy,"" she said. As part of her job, Godfrey seeks potential employers who will allocate some of their positions for people with disabilities, but as unemployment has soared, competition has gotten fierce. ""Usually, we can get three to five jobs a month. Lately it's been one or no jobs each month. There are some employers I have talked to about hiring our clients. It's in a restaurant-type business and they have people coming in and putting applications that have previously worked at Morgan Stanley,"" she said. For Welsh, the competition and the wait have proven too long. He recently started a home cake-making business using cooking skills he learned from his grandmother when he was growing up in Alabama. He gets orders from local clients and delivers the cakes with the aid of public transit for the disabled. He gets about three orders a week, at an average price of $15 per cake. Welsh said he evaluated his skills and abilities before starting his business. ""I know that I can bake cakes. I know that people like cakes; people like to eat a little something sweet, "" he said. He added that he has not lost hope about finding a job. Wayne McMillan, CEO of BDI, says job numbers for people with disabilities show little hope. ""It's terrible to be without a job in this country. It's tragic to have a disability and be without a job. We are having people come through the programs that we are not being able to place. Last year we placed 171 folks; during the month of December zero; January two. This is a real crisis for us,"" McMillan said. For the first time, the Department of Labor in February released a report tracking unemployment rates among disabled job seekers. The survey found a 14 percent unemployment rate among disabled workers -- almost double that of the nondisabled population. And only 21 percent of the available working disabled population is employed, compared with the 65 percent of nondisabled workers. ""It is not at the top of most people's minds,"" said Megan Rutter Branch, director of communication for BDI. ""They are seeing family members go off and have the dignity of work, and earn a paycheck, and the only expectation that is had of them is to sit at home, watch TV and stay out of trouble."" She emphasized that disabled workers have one of the highest retention rates in the industry, 82 percent to 87 percent, according to BDI figures. ""Our folks wouldn't want to leave. They had to overcome all these hurdles to get a job."" According to the U.S. Census, people with disabilities comprise the largest minority group, approximately 20 percent of the population. Robin L. Shaffert, senior director of corporate social responsibility with the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), says it is critical for this group to be included in economic recovery plans. ""It is very important for our society that we are using all the productive force of our society. It is important that we are also looking at people with disabilities and make sure we are looking for solutions for them as well,"" Shaffert said. AAPD research shows that President Obama's economic stimulus package has allocated funds to help people with disabilities, such as increased Medicaid help, vocational rehabilitation, help with independent living and specialized education. Until that help comes, Welsh, who suffers from spina bifida, says he is holding onto his faith. ""You got to keep God in your heart. As long as you got him in your side everything will go smoothly,"" he said.","Institute that places disabled employees says employers all but stopped calling .

"(CNN)  -- A commuter airliner that crashed Thursday in upstate New York, killing 50 people, underwent violent pitching and rolling seconds before impact, with passengers experiencing twice the normal force of gravity, a federal investigator said Sunday. Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. The plane's final 800-foot fall took five seconds, Steve Chealander of the National Transportation Safety Board said. The aircraft crashed into a home in Clarence Center, New York, near Buffalo, on Thursday night, killing all 49 people aboard. A 61-year-old man in the house died also, but his wife and daughter survived. Final motions of the aircraft were so drastic that the plane's autopilot automatically disengaged and warnings sounded, Chealander said, citing information from the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders. Also, a ""stick-shaker"" device, which noisily vibrates an airplane's controls to warn the pilot of imminent stall, kicked in, he said. The flight crew of Continental Connection Flight 3407, operated by Colgan Air, discussed ""significant"" ice buildup on the aircraft's windshield and wings before the crash, and icing has become a focus as a possible cause.  Follow the plane's path » . Chealander said the plane's de-icing system was turned on 11 minutes after the flight left Newark, New Jersey, for Buffalo, and remained on for the entire flight. He said the pilots were told before departure from Newark that there was ""light to moderate icing"" in the Buffalo area but that no other pilots had reported problems with their landings at the Buffalo airport. ""It was really not a bad-weather day, and they chose to launch [from Newark],"" Chealander said of the pilot and the first officer. The plane was on autopilot during its approach to the Buffalo airport, Chealander said. As to questions about whether the autopilot should have been turned off, Chealander said using it even in bad weather situations ""is normal.""  Watch Chealander discuss autopilot options » . ""You're encouraged to use the autopilot to help you with the workloads of these high intense weather situations that we fly into all the time,"" he said. He said the NTSB in the past has recommended to the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees civil aviation including commercial airlines, that in severe icing conditions, ""it might be best to disconnect autopilot so that the pilot might have a better feel"" for the aircraft's conditions. However, severe icing is ""not what we saw here,"" Chealander said, adding that the FAA has no such disengagement rule in effect. ""To say that they should not have been flying on autopilot is not correct,"" Chealander said. The pilots' recorded remarks about ""significant"" icing did not indicate ""severe"" icing, he said. The NTSB has said problems for the 74-seat Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 occurred when the pilots lowered the landing gear and tried to set the wing flaps to slow the aircraft for landing. Offering more details, Chealander said Sunday that the plane's nose pitched up 31 degrees, then down 45 degrees. The aircraft rolled left 46 degrees then right 105 degrees, or past the 90-degree vertical point, he said. Inside the cabin, he said, conditions went from lower than normal gravitational force to twice the normal force as the plane rocked through the sky. iReport.com: Send your photos, videos from the scene . Chealander said the NTSB's investigation of the crash site indicated that the two propellers on the turboprop aircraft were in place when the crash occurred. ""The airplane hadn't lost anything prior to impact. It came down intact,"" he said. Meanwhile, local authorities working to recover remains of the victims said Sunday that a federal team of more than 40 people using some $2.8 million worth of scientific equipment would begin on Monday to help establish positive identification of the victims. But because of the intensity of the crash and a subsequent fire, ""whether we can identify everybody or not remains to be seen,"" Erie County Health Commission Anthony Billittier said. Authorities had recovered 15 bodies as of Saturday night, but Billittier announced Sunday that numbers of recovered bodies will no longer be released ""out of respect for the families.""","NTSB: People aboard experienced twice the normal gravitational force before crash .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Two coalition U.S. soldiers were killed along with three Afghans, including a police official, while trying to disable a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan Sunday, the U.S. military said. Afghan police destroy poppy fields in Helmand province. The explosion was under investigation, the military said. The soldiers were part of a convoy of coalition troops accompanying Gulab Mangal, the governor of Helmand province, to a village where he intended to talk to residents about alternatives to opium farming. The convoy came upon two bombs stacked on top of each other, said local journalist Abdul Tawab Qureshi. When the soldiers tried to disable the bombs, the second one went off, added Qureshi, saying the blast killed the police chief of the province's Nad Ali district, Mohammed Nader; a police officer; and a translator. Over the years, opium and heroin -- both derivatives of the poppy -- have served as a major source of revenue for the insurgency, most notably the Taliban movement that once ruled Afghanistan. Though southern Afghanistan still provides about two-thirds of the world's opium and heroin, poppy cultivation has dropped by 20 percent -- to the lowest level since 2006.

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- France bears responsibility for deporting Jews to their deaths in concentration camps during World War II, the country's highest court ruled Monday. Jews and foreigners are rounded up in Paris in May 1941. But, the Council of State said, ""measures taken since the end of the Second World War have compensated for the damage."" Northern France was directly occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II while the south of the country was ruled by the Vichy government that collaborated with Adolf Hitler. France's role in the deportation of its Jews was a taboo subject for decades after the war. The trial of Maurice Papon, a civil servant in the collaborationist Vichy government, for deporting Jews, forced the country to confront its role in the Holocaust. Papon was convicted in 1998 by a French court for complicity in crimes against humanity for his role in the deportation of 1,590 Jews from the city of Bordeaux. Most of the deportees later perished at the concentration camp at Auschwitz in modern day Poland. Papon died in February 2007, aged 96, after serving part of his term and then being freed on health grounds. There were approximately 350,000 Jews in France at the time of the country's defeat by Germany in 1940. At least half of those were refugees who had already fled Germany or countries already under Nazi occupation, according to the Web site of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. At least 77,000 Jews were deported to their deaths from French transit camps between 1942 and the end of German occupation in December 1944. Of these, around a third were French citizens and more than 8,000 were children under 13.","Court: France bears responsibility for sending Jews to WWII concentration camps .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama reached out to Iran on Friday -- the start of the Iranian New Year -- in a video message offering ""the promise of a new beginning"" that is ""grounded in mutual respect."" Obama's message to Iran echoes his inaugural speech, where he said ""we seek a new way forward."" The message is a dramatic shift in tone from that of the Bush administration, which included Iran, along with North Korea and Iraq, in an ""axis of evil."" It also echoes Obama's inaugural speech, in which he said to the Muslim world, ""we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect."" In Friday's video, Obama said: ""The United States wants the Islamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations. You have that right, but it comes with real responsibilities. And that place cannot be reached through terror or arms, but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the Iranian people and civilization."" There was no immediate response from Tehran to Obama's message, but Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said last month that his country would welcome talks with the United States ""in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect."" The United States, several European nations and Israel suspect that Tehran has been trying to acquire the capacity to build nuclear weapons, but Iran says its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. Last month, the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security released a report saying that Iran has reached ""nuclear weapons breakout capability"" -- it has enough uranium to make a nuclear bomb. The report was based on an analysis of data from the International Atomic Energy Agency. However, an IAEA official who asked not to be named cautioned against drawing such dramatic conclusions from the data, saying Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons-grade material. That hasn't been done, the official said. The United States has had tortuous relations with Tehran since the Islamic revolution in 1979, but the Obama message speaks of ""new beginnings"" with the promise of a new year. ""We have serious differences that have grown over time. My administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us, and to pursuing constructive ties among the United States, Iran and the international community,"" the president said. ""This process will not be advanced by threats. We seek, instead, engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect.""","Video message coincides with the start of the Iranian New Year .

"(CNN)  -- A young blogger arrested in Iran for allegedly insulting supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in an Internet posting has died in prison, his attorney said Friday. The blogger had been jailed for allegedly insulting Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in an internet posting. Attorney Mohammad Ali Dadkhah said Omid Mir Sayafi, reported to be in his 20s, died in Evin prison, which is located in Tehran and known for its wing that holds political prisoners. Dadkhah said a fellow inmate, Dr. Hessam Firouzi, called him Wednesday night with the news -- and said he believed Sayafi would have lived if he received proper medical care. Dadkhah said Firouzi, an imprisoned human-rights activist, said that he carried a semi-conscious Sayafi to a prison doctor but that he didn't receive the care he needed. ""It was Dr. Firouzi's opinion that if he would've received proper medical attention, he would not have died,"" Dadkhah said. He said Sayafi was buried on Thursday and that his calls to the prison asking for an explanation have not been returned. Dadkhah said Sayafi ""sounded OK"" at about 2 p.m. on Wednesday when he last spoke to him by telephone. He said the blogger asked for a book about Nowruz, the Iranian New Year, which begins Friday. The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, which advocates for activists in the country, quoted Firouzi on its Web site as saying Sayafi suffered from depression and had taken extra doses of medication on Wednesday. The group blamed Iran's government for unsafe conditions in its prisons. ""Iranian leaders have relegated the administration of the prison system to a group of incompetent and cruel officials who are showing their utter disregard for human life,"" said Hadi Ghaemi, spokesman for the campaign. ""If the authorities do not move quickly to hold negligent officials responsible, they are reinforcing impunity and the lack of accountability."" Sayafi was first arrested in April, then released for 41 days before being arrested again. He was sentenced to 2½ years in prison for comments on a blog that his lawyer argued was intended only for a few friends to read.","Omid Mir Sayafi, reported to be in his 20s, dies in Evin prison .

"(CNN) -- ""Battlestar Galactica,"" the TV series that has held up a mirror to post-9/11 politics and paranoia for the past four seasons, comes to an end Friday. ""Battlestar Galactica"" drew consistent praise from the critics, but never attracted huge audiences. The show's legions of fans may be in mourning, but executive producer David Eick finds the looming finale bittersweet. ""It's a combination of deep sadness and a little bit of relief,"" he told CNN by phone from Los Angeles. Eick and his producing partner Ronald D. Moore revived -- or, as they like to say, ""reimagined"" -- a campy late-1970s space opera about a ragtag group of survivors from an attack that wiped out most of humanity, making it a gritty, tense, and morally ambiguous drama. Echoes of the traumas that shaped contemporary America are inescapable, from a shot in opening credits that looks like Manhattan before the attacks of September 11, 2001, to questions about curtailing civil liberties in wartime. Eick says the show is a reflection of its times. The show ""went into development very shortly after the attacks -- December of 2001. Not only were we post-9/11, but the wounds were so extremely fresh, there was still a great deal of shock,"" he said. Some of the imagery and themes of the show derived directly from the attacks, he said, such as a ""wall of grief"" where people place pictures of dead comrades. The show's central conflict has a religious dimension: The show's villains, the mechanical yet human-looking Cylons, believe in one god; the humans believe in many. ""The antagonists are motivated by a belief that they are operating with the blessing, the permission of an all-powerful god. To the extent that religion and spiritual beliefs were chief motivations for the antagonists, that had resonance with al Qaeda,"" Eick said. But, he said, the writers fought to keep the show from becoming morally simplistic. ""Sci-fi has always been a safe haven because we're not talking about al Qaeda, we're talking about the Cylons,"" he said. ""We went to great lengths to try to see things from the opponents' point of view, to make the audience ask if they are rooting for the right side,"" he said. In fact, the Cylons become increasingly complicated characters as the series goes on, ultimately warring among themselves -- as do the humans. ""The intention of 'Battlestar Galactica' was to present flawed heroes, who fought among themselves as much as the enemy,"" Eick said. ""We are drawn to heroes who succeed in spite of themselves."" ""Growing discontent with the [Bush] administration allowed us to deepen many of those flaws in those characters,"" he said, even as he denied the show was designed  to reflect the headlines. ""Rarely do I recall saying: 'Let's do Abu Ghraib,' "" said Eick, referring to the notorious prison in Iraq. The series does include an interrogation episode with a clear reference to waterboarding. The show drew consistent praise from the critics, but never attracted huge audiences from its home on the Sci-Fi channel, a cable network. Nielsen figures suggest the miniseries that launched the show drew about 4 million viewers, but audiences dipped to about half that in the third season before rebounding slightly as the fourth and final season began last year. Eick said he did not watch the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" series, which ran from 1978 to 1980 -- another gloomy era in America. But he knew he did not want his protagonist to be like the hero of that show, even if they shared the same name. ""In the original incarnation, the main character of Adama was the picture of perfection, a military genius and a family man and a diplomat and a great orator, and and and... We were in an age where it didn't seem plausible that one person could have all the answers,"" he said. ""The world didn't need another moralizing space opera,"" he said, drawing a specific contrast with the much more successful ""Star Trek"" franchise, or, as he called it ""escapist 'Star Trek'-ian action-adventure."" ""The virtue of 'Star Trek' is that is does present a problem -- a moral crisis that its main characters ultimately solve or answer in a way that is intended to be a model for the audience,"" Eick said. ""They come away feeling better about themselves."" That has never been ""Battlestar Galactica's"" intention, he said. ""To the show's good fortune, the audience was in need of a vehicle for its angst and its paranoia,"" said Eick, who said that as a viewer, he ""was much more seduced"" by darker stories that ""felt like a reflection of reality."" The walls of his home, he said, are adorned with posters from just such dark films: ""Jaws,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""The Exorcist,"" ""Lenny"" and ""Manhattan."" (He also likes the lighter fare of ""The Blues Brothers."" ) ""For some people, there's something very cathartic about watching nihilistic drama,"" he said. ""There is a relief associated with it. ""We often hear that what audiences want in troubled times is escapism and comfort food. I think it's the opposite. They want a way to feel their reality reflected back at them.""","Show featured group of survivors from an attack that wiped out most of humanity .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Bidding failed to meet expectations Saturday on a uniquely complete skeleton of a Jurassic-era dryosaurus -- a long-necked, plant-eating dinosaur -- so it was no-sale for the centerpiece at an auction of rare skeletons, fossils and other prehistoric memorabilia. Fossils including dinosaur skeletons are on display at the I.M. Chait Gallery on Saturday. Auctioneers at the I.M. Chait Gallery had hoped the 150-million-year-old, 9-foot-long dryosaurus would sell for as much as $500,000, but the bidding did not add up. Two museums are said to still be interested in acquiring the skeleton, being sold by Western Paleontological Laboratories out of Utah. An 18,000-year-old, 7-foot-tall and 15-foot-long skeleton of a teenage woolly mammoth from Siberia took the auction's top price, fetching close to $60,000. A completely opalized green, blue, yellow and red ammonite fossil measuring 2½ feet in diameter went for close to $50,000. Both were bought by private collections.

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Pirates on a seized Saudi-owned oil supertanker are delaying release of the ship despite receiving a ransom because of a fatal drowning accident that killed four of their colleagues, a journalist who spoke with one of the pirates told CNN. A small aircraft is observed by the U.S. Navy flying over the Sirius Star during a seeming ransom payment Friday. The pirates had been expected to release the Sirius Star, which they've held since November 15, after a ransom payment was parachuted onto the ship. The journalist told CNN that the pirate who spoke said four pirates drowned after a skiff carrying leaving the Sirius Star capsized due to rough seas. Sea charts showed that waves in the area were reaching 5 to 7 feet at the time. There were five pirates in the skiff and one survived, the journalist said. The bodies of the other four were recovered, he said, adding that this will delay the exit of the pirates still remaining on board the ship and thus affect the ship's release after payment of the ransom. The tanker was carrying two million barrels of crude oil worth about $100 million when pirates hijacked it off the coast of Somalia. Pirates seized the Sirius Star more than 450 nautical miles off the African coast in one of their most audacious hijackings to date. The pirates told another journalist that they received $3 million in ransom money, but lost part of it when the skiff capsized. The remaining ransom money is still aboard the ship with the rest of the pirates. The U.S. Navy took photographs and observed as an apparent ransom payment was parachuted aboard the tanker. The pirates aboard the supertanker have equipment to check for counterfeit bills, authorities said. ""While the potential release of the Sirius Star is undoubtedly excellent news, we must not forget that nearly 300 other merchant mariners (on other ships) are still being held captive,"" said Commodore Tim Lowe, deputy Combined Maritime Forces commander.

"(CNN) -- A British man convicted of having sex on a Dubai beach was re-arrested as he prepared to board a flight back to the UK, according to media reports. File image of one of the co-accused -- Vince Acors -- arriving at court in Dubai in September. Vince Acors, 34, from London, was due to fly to Heathrow Monday following his deportation from the Gulf state. But he was detained at Dubai Airport and returned to jail as his flight confirmation was allegedly ""not in order,"" the British Press Association said. Acors and fellow Briton Michelle Palmer, 36, were initially given three-month jail terms for unmarried sex and public indecency, but these were suspended on appeal. Acors had been due to return last Friday but a hold-up in the deportation process meant he was unable to board a UK-bound plane and spent the weekend in jail, PA said. His lawyer Andrew Crossley said: ""The return of Vince Acors has been delayed yet again and he will not be returning to the UK. The situation is close to becoming farcical and Vince is severely disappointed. ""After having booked and confirmed his return flight on three separate occasions through the course of the day Vince was re-arrested at Dubai Airport, as his flight confirmation was allegedly not in order. He has been returned to jail, his precise return is now unknown."" Palmer and Acors were arrested on a public beach shortly after midnight on July 5. Police charged them with illicit relations, public indecency, and public intoxication. A court found them guilty in October and fined them 1,000 dirhams ($367) for the charge of public indecency. Both denied they had intercourse. And during the trial, Mattar argued that the public prosecutor failed to produce corroborative evidence against his clients on the first two charges, though he said both tested positive for liquor. The United Arab Emirates, where Dubai is located, is home to thousands of expatriates and is among the most moderate Gulf states. Still, the oil-rich kingdom adheres to certain Islamic rules.","Michelle Palmer and Vincent Acors, faced three-month sentence .

"(CNN) -- Children were among the victims of a plane crash that killed as many as 17 people Sunday in Butte, Montana, according to authorities in Oroville, California, where the aircraft stopped for fuel. Martha Guidoni said this photo was taken after she and her husband saw the plane ""nosedive"" in Butte, Montana. The single-engine plane stopped at the Oroville airport at about 11 a.m. PT, refueled and departed about half an hour later, Police Chief Kirk Trostle said. ""There were some adults and children on board,"" he told reporters Sunday evening, adding the passengers got out briefly to stretch while the pilot refueled the plane. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mike Fergus said based on preliminary reports, 17 people died in the crash. The Pilatus PC-12 was headed to Bozeman, Montana, but rerouted to Butte instead and crashed 500 feet short of the runway at Butte's Bert Mooney Airport, Fergus said. The flight plan originated in Redlands, California, according to flight-tracking site FBOweb.com. Stops were made in Vacaville, California, then Oroville, before the plane headed for Montana. Preliminary information indicates the pilot did not declare an emergency aboard the plane before the crash, Fergus said. The National Transportation Safety Board is sending an investigation team to the scene, Kristi Dunks, an aerosafety investigator with the agency, told reporters in Butte on Sunday evening. Dunks said the plane crashed at the Holy Cross Cemetery, located just south of the airport's Runway 3. She said there were no survivors, though she wouldn't confirm the number of people on board the plane. No one on the ground was injured, Sheriff John Walsh said. Eric Teitelman, Oroville's director of community development and public works, said the small airport has no control tower but because it has a ""wide-open runway"" and a self-service fuel system, it is a frequent stop for private aircraft. Teitelman said at least one person -- an aircraft owner doing servicing work -- was at the airport Sunday when the Pilatus stopped for refueling. The aircraft owner ""met the pilot, saw the children running around,"" Teitelman said. The plane, manufactured in 2001, was registered to Eagle Cap Leasing in Enterprise, Oregon, according to the FAA. Martha Guidoni told CNN she and her husband witnessed the plane crash. She photographed one of the first images of the scene, which showed the cemetery in the foreground of a huge blaze.  See a map of Butte, Montana » .

"What the heck are triglycerides? If you don't know, you have plenty of company. One in every three Americans has high triglyceride levels, which elevate risk of heart disease and early death. The fatty particles found in your blood are important for heart health, but don't get nearly as much attention as, say, cholesterol. Now a new study suggests that there's a good chance that your triglycerides are in the unhealthy zone, whether you know what they are or not. About one-third of American adults have triglyceride levels that are borderline or too high, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report published Monday in Archives of Internal Medicine. ""I see it as a major problem that we've completely ignored this problem so far,"" said Dr. Børge Nordestgaard of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. Nordestgaard has conducted research linking high triglyceride levels to cardiovascular disease and early death, but was not involved in the CDC research. ""Everyone in clinical practice seemed to be so focused on LDL, LDL, LDL [bad cholesterol], people tended to forget triglycerides."" he said. Being too heavy, getting too little activity, drinking lots of alcohol and eating lots of saturated fat can all add up to higher triglyceride levels because the body stores excess calories as triglycerides. Health.com: Fats to eat, fats to avoid . Triglycerides are a third type of fatty particle found in the blood, along with LDL cholesterol and HDL (also known as good) cholesterol. People taking certain medications or those who have diabetes or a genetic condition can have high triglycerides. Health.com: What cholesterol tests reveal about your heart's health . Nordestgaard said that high triglycerides are as dangerous as high cholesterol levels as a risk marker for heart disease and early death. ""There's a really big potential for further prevention of heart disease and strokes by getting more focused on that,"" he said.  Health.com: How stress can trigger heart problems . The problem: Right now, the best way to attack high triglycerides is by losing weight, eating more healthily, and becoming more active-- a tall order for many of us. In the new report, Dr. Earl Ford of the CDC, and his colleagues looked at a nationally representative group of 5,610 people 20 and older. They found that 33.1 percent had triglyceride levels above 150 milligrams per deciliter, while 17.9 percent had levels above 200 milligrams per deciliter, 1.7 percent had levels of 500 milligrams per deciliter or above, and 0.4 percent had levels higher than 1,000 milligrams per deciliter. Triglycerides of 150 to 199 milligrams per deciliter are considered borderline high and anything above 200 milligrams per deciliter is considered too high. Men were more likely than women to have high triglycerides, while whites were at greater risk than African Americans and Mexican Americans. Very high triglyceride levels can cause inflammation of the pancreas. Although there's increasing evidence that elevated triglycerides are associated with cardiovascular disease and early death, no one has yet shown that treating high triglyceride levels reduces cardiovascular disease, according to an editorial by Dr. Warren G. Thompson and Dr. Gerald T. Gau of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, in Rochester, Minnesota. Lifestyle changes-- exercising, losing weight, swapping healthy fats for unhealthy ones, and the like-- are the treatment of choice right now for people with triglyceride levels between 150 milligrams per deciliter and 500 milligrams per deciliter . According to the National Cholesterol Education Panel, higher-risk people with triglyceride levels falling in this range may also need medication. Beyond lifestyle changes, treatments for high triglycerides include statins, fibrates, niacin, and fish oil. But while fibrates reduce the risk of cardiovascular events like stroke and heart attack, Thompson and Gau note, they don't reduce mortality and actually increase the risk of death from non-heart-related causes; they are only recommended for people with triglycerides above 1,000 milligrams per deciliter. ""What we really need scientifically, we need companies to come up with drugs that are more efficient at particularly reducing triglycerides,"" said Nordestgaard. He usually recommends that people try statins first if lifestyle changes are not enough-- as do Thompson and Gau. Health.com: The therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) diet for heart disease .

Initially as many as nine people were reported missing, but after seven of them reported to the authorities that they were safe, search and rescue efforts focused on finding the two remaining missing men. Rescue workers found the body at about 2 a.m. Sunday morning (8 p.m. ET Saturday). It has not been identified. The search for the second missing person is still ongoing, Gelss said. It is still not clear what caused the collapse of the building which contained the city's historical archives, bringing down parts of the two nearby structures.

"(CNN)  -- Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, facing an international arrest warrant, is paying the price for pandering to the West, al Qaeda's second-in-command said in an audio statement released Tuesday. Ayman al-Zawahiri, seen here in 2007, said Tuesday the Sudanese president pandered to the West. ""I am not defending Omar al-Bashir or his regime, nor am I defending what it has done in Darfur and elsewhere,"" Ayman al-Zawahiri said in the statement released by al Qaeda's production company, as-Sahab Media. But, he said, ""the issue isn't one of Darfur and solving its problems; the issue is one of making excuses for more foreign interference in the Muslims' countries in the framework of the contemporary Zionist Crusade."" The warrant issued by the International Criminal Court earlier this month accuses al-Bashir of war crimes and crimes against humanity, charges he denies. In response, Sudan ordered 13 international aid groups to leave the country, groups that the United Nations says provide roughly half the assistance delivered in Darfur. ""The Bashir regime is reaping what it sowed,"" al-Zawahiri said. ""For many long years, it continued to back down and backtrack in front of American Crusader pressure."" He further accused Sudan of expelling members of the mujahedeen who had sought refuge there, particularly Osama bin Laden, and declaring ""in an audacious lie that they had left voluntarily, then attempting to beg payment for that from the Saudi regime and the Americans."" Al-Zawahiri asked, ""Why hasn't the United Nations moved to protect the Palestinians in Gaza from Israeli barbarity and criminality, while it pretends to cry over the suffering of the people of Darfur? Why hasn't the United Nations and the international community intervened to lift the siege from Gaza, while it pretends to cry over the people of Darfur being deprived of relief and aid?"" ""The Sudanese regime continued to pant for American approval, and it agreed to the division of the Sudan, paved the way for the imminent secession of the south, provided all the information it had on the emigrants and mujahedeen to the American government, and handed over some of them to the regimes of treason and criminality in their countries,"" al-Zawahiri said. ""But despite all that, the senior criminals weren't satisfied with it and continued to besiege it with demands and interference, even going so far as to demand the arrest of its leaders and prominent figures."" He said he wants to send a message to Muslims in Sudan, telling them they are being targeted so that Islam can be eliminated from the country. ""And in order for Islam to be eliminated from the Sudan, a justification must be found for Western military intervention,"" he said. The audio message is the fifth released this year by al-Zawahiri and the fourth in English, according to Virginia-based IntelCenter. The center said on its Web site it focuses ""on studying terrorist groups and other threat actors ... and disseminating that information in a timely manner to those who can act on it.""","Ayman al-Zawahiri says he is not defending Sudanese regime, actions in Darfur .

"(CNN) -- Every day for decades, it was an essential part of the day for millions of listeners. A voice would boom out over the radio airwaves, announcing, ""Hello,  Americans, this is Paul Harvey! Stand by for news!"" Paul Harvey gave Brent Burns his ""big break,"" giving one of his songs national exposure for the first time. After more than 70 years on the air, Harvey died Saturday at the age of 90. His broadcasts were heard on more than 1,200 radio stations, according to his Web site. iReporters shared their memories of hearing Harvey's program through the generations and told how he affected their lives, and in some cases their careers. When Anna Hiller of Albany, California, heard of Harvey's passing, she was immediately reminded of spending time at her grandparents' home in Baltimore, Maryland, as a child. ""His voice was inescapable, ubiquitous and energizing, emerging from the silver radio in the kitchen,"" she said. She describes Harvey's broadcasts as a ""ritual"" for her grandparents. ""The voice of Paul Harvey would echo throughout the entire first floor, and even though I was too young to follow the stories, I knew my grandmother was listening intently, as was my grandpa from his study."" John Hargis Sr. has memories of his mother listening to Harvey every day as well. ""I once asked her why we couldn't watch TV when Harvey was on, and she replied that Harvey gave her honest news,"" he said . Hargis has since lost 70 percent of his hearing and says that Harvey's voice was one of the few he could understand. He lost his mother in 2001, and Harvey's death reminds him of her. iReport.com: Hargis pays tribute to Harvey, his mother . Bev Cummins of McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, was captivated as a child by Harvey's skills as a storyteller, as heard on his second daily broadcast, ""The Rest of the Story."" ""He enriched our young lives with his quiet, warm voice that phrased words so well in my mind,"" she said. ""It had all the comfort of a story being read at bedtime."" Cummins says that she modeled the way she told bedtime stories to her daughter after Harvey. ""The lucky ones among us still have the love of a good Paul Harvey story."" For some iReporters, Harvey was not just an important part of their daily lives. He gave one his ""big break."" Brent Burns of Gulf Shores, Alabama, was at the beginning of his career in the music business, with a few recordings released but nothing hugely successful. Then, Harvey played his song about the 1970s gas crisis, ""Cheaper Crude or No More Food."" ""It bounced me onto the world stage immediately,"" he said. Burns says he appeared in magazines and television after this first major exposure. ""It just goes to show how well-loved and listened-to Paul Harvey was,"" he said. ""He was just a brilliant guy who really had a command of the language."" Burns believes that his song might be the only one Harvey ever played. iReport.com: 'Integrity was Paul Harvey's middle name' After entering giant frogs into the famous Calaveras County frog jumping contest in 1990, Andy Koffman of Seattle, Washington, appeared on ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson"" as well as other television programs. ""But,"" he said, ""the one thing I will never forget is Paul Harvey's voice talking about me and my giant frogs on the radio."" A retired radio host himself, Gerald Dimmitt of Vancouver, Washington, will never forget hosting a dinner where Harvey was the guest speaker. At first, Dimmitt was unsure if he wanted to take the job because of Harvey's then-support of the war in Vietnam. ""Due to the fact that he was an icon in the business, I went ahead and did it,"" he said. Dimmitt and a small group of attendees at the dinner discussed the war with Harvey. Toward the end of the conversation, Harvey told them to listen to one of his broadcasts coming up in a few days. Dimmitt listened to that broadcast, and heard Harvey announce his opposition to escalating the war. iReport.com: Dimmitt remembers his dinner with Harvey . As for Hiller, her grandfather is gone, but her grandmother now lives in Virginia. ""I have a hard time not believing that the same radio that carried Paul Harvey's booming voice throughout the house on Gibbons Avenue is set up in Grandma's room in Virginia, and that she will miss him telling her 'Good day,' as he had for over 50 years.""","iReporters remember how legendary radio host Paul Harvey affected their lives .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Tim Geithner may be the latest political piñata in Washington these days, but -- policy aside -- there may be another reason he is the one fellow everyone is picking on at Treasury: He's there alone. President Obama's ethics code requires that no lobbyist can work for an agency he may have lobbied. Believe it or not, Geithner is the only confirmed official at his department. Some top nominees, even those who have served in government before, have decided to withdraw. Others are still pending as they go through arduous background checks that one pro-Obama Democrat calls ""maddening vetting hell."" Sure, this is about extensive scrutiny to make sure no one has a tax problem after Geithner's own embarrassing unpaid tax bill. But the staffing problem is not just at Treasury, and it goes way beyond the time-consuming nature of extensive background checks. It's also about overreaching anti-lobbyist rules. Consider Tom Malinowski. He's the advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, an expert on genocide and torture. But when it came time for a top human rights job at the State Department, he was turned away. Why? ""Because he lobbied against torture,"" says one incredulous administration official. ""It's crazy."" But the rules are the rules: The ethics code requires that no lobbyist can be hired to work for an agency he may have lobbied. So, just to clarify: Someone like Malinowski who lobbied against torture and is a widely acknowledged expert on international human rights law is, er, blackballed. More to the point, he was shown the door precisely because he tried to influence Congress on an issue that both he and the administration agree, and care deeply about. (Malinowski won't comment.) Only in the Alice-in-Wonderland world of Washington would this make any sense. And it still doesn't. It's just a prime instance of the problems that can arise when great-sounding (theoretical) campaign one-liners rub up against the (real) difficulties of trying to staff a government. In other words, the short-term interest in demonizing all lobbyists has led to some very difficult staffing problems. So, if you're an environmental expert and lobbyist, forget about the Environmental Protection Agency. But you might want to think about some work in the health field. That is, unless someone says you're a lucky exception! They're rare, but William Lynn is one. He's a top defense department appointee who once worked as a lobbyist for Raytheon, a military contractor. The White House says that (a) it hasn't had much trouble staffing the government and (b) is willing to make reasonable exceptions. So far we have only seen a handful. The problem has made it difficult to operate at every department. ""A lot of good people just can't go into government,"" says one administration official. ""It's a huge departure from the spirit of what they wanted."" Indeed, he adds, here's an unintended consequence: ""We're setting up a system where the only people who qualify to work in government are the ones who never actually left government."" Oh, great. So instead of getting the best and the brightest from finance and elsewhere, we're recycling some folks from Capitol Hill. Not that they're unqualified, but the administration needs input from multiple sources -- outside of Washington. On top of that, the Treasury has another public relations problem: The appointment of anyone with any tie to a bank that has been bailed out or any institution that is tied to the mortgage mess is a non-starter. No wonder it's hard to find the experts. Yet much of this problem is self-inflicted. The no-lobbyist rule could have been ""softened"" to exclude nonprofit lobbyists. The administration decided against that, one senior official tells me. ""We didn't want to label people as 'good lobbyists' or 'bad lobbyists.' "" Besides, he adds, ""We think we are flexible."" That's not the feeling you get speaking with either those jumping hoops to try to get into government and those who have been turned away. As the administration faces its huge economic crisis, it needs all hands on deck. After all, you can't rebuild public confidence in a government if you don't have one.","Obama's overreaching anti-lobbyist rules interfere with governing, Gloria Borger says .

"(CNN) -- Dr. J. Stephen Jones had seven vasectomies to perform in a day. Some urologists around the country are reporting increased numbers of patients coming in for vasectomies. The schedule for Jones, a Cleveland, Ohio, urologist, has become more crowded during a recent boom in vasectomies. ""My staff came to me and said, what's happening?"" said Jones, the chairman of the Department of Regional Urology of Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. ""Why are we suddenly having an explosion in guys asking for vasectomies?"" They looked at their statistics and realized the uptick started around November as the economic crisis deepened. October went down in the history books as one of Wall Street's worst months. Since then, the Cleveland Clinic has seen a 50 percent increase in vasectomies, an outpatient surgery that is the cheapest form of permanent birth control. Vasectomies are less invasive and cheaper than tubal ligation, which involves blocking, tieing or cutting a woman's fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy. ""It's unlikely that some guy read the Dow Jones numbers that day and said, 'Why don't we have a vasectomy?' "" Jones said. ""More likely, people have already been considering it and typically a guy and his wife have spoken a year or two about this."" Jones was told by patients that they were getting vasectomies because they were losing their jobs and health insurance, or concerned about being out of work soon. ""They realize they don't have the financial security long-term with what's going on,"" Jones said. ""Several of them have mentioned, 'We can't afford to have any more children in this economy.' My perception is that it's more of the concept of raising children in an uncertain economic future."" Much like Jones, Dr. Marc Goldstein, surgeon-in-chief of male reproductive medicine and surgery at the Cornell Institute for Reproductive Medicine in New York, saw a 48 percent increase in vasectomy consultations compared with the same time last year. ""I have never seen anything like this,"" said Goldstein, a urologist for the last 30 years. ""When things started to go south in the stock market, then the vasectomy consults went north."" Half of Goldstein's New York patients work in the financial sector. New patients filed into his office in November. ""I think the situation of finance and the economy is the major reason,"" Goldstein said. ""Some of them have mentioned that, 'It cost $30,000 a year to put my kids in private school and I can't afford to have another one.' It's never the sole reason, but it's certainly a contributing factor."" During the vasectomy, the doctor cuts the two vas deferens, which are the tubes carrying sperm from the testicles to become semen. After the procedure, men can still have sex, but their semen does not contain sperm and therefore they can no longer father children. Doctors can attempt to reverse the procedure, but vasectomy reversals are expensive and only work half the time in restoring sperm flow. Carl Haub, a demographer with the Population Reference Bureau, a private research firm, said the National Center for Health Statistics' data showed that, ""During bad economic times, the Depression and the recession in the 1970s, the birth rate did go down.""  See the chart on fertility rates in the United States from 1917 to 2007 » . ""Some folks will postpone having kids,"" he said. ""If you had a vasectomy, you've made a bigger decision that you're never going to have another child."" When people stop having children, it implies a loss of confidence in their future employment prospects. ""Am I going to have a job in six months or a year from now?"" Haub said. ""If I'm concerned about that, people are not going to increase their financial obligations... It's naïve to say the economy didn't play a significant role in lowering the birth rate."" It's too early to tell whether this recession has crimped the birth rate, Haub said. At this point, most of the evidence of increased vasectomies has been anecdotal from practicing urologists, because there is no national registry for sterilizations. The number of appointment requests spiked 30 percent in January 2009 on the Web site vasectomy.com, which links people with local urologists. But throughout the last few months, appointment requests have been fairly level, said Dr. Ted Benderev, founder of the site. Dr. Lawrence Ross, a professor of urology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and former president of the American Urological Association, said the school's clinics have seen moderate increases in the last six months to a year and that vasectomies are growing popular among lower-income clients. ""My guess is that since economic times have worsened, people are concerned about their ability to raise larger families and are opting for more permanent birth control,"" Ross said. People who are concerned about losing their health insurance are trying to take advantage of the coverage for a procedure they've long considered. ""It may have something to do with the economy,"" said Dr. Bryan Kansas, a urologist. ""I can't count on my hands, in the last three months, the number of times someone has said they're about to lose their insurance and ask to squeeze them in."" He and his colleagues have seen a similar uptick in their Austin, Texas, practice called The Urology Team. Throughout March Madness, Kansas' office has a special on vasectomies called, ""Vas-Madness"" to capitalize on their patient's obsession with the college basketball tournament. Patients ""would love to have a procedure, go home and sit there when you've got all-day programming, watch basketball,"" Kansas said. After the less-than-hourlong procedure, patients usually spend a day or two recovering, moving gingerly and icing the soreness. Some men time their vasectomies around the time of major sports events such as the Masters Golf Tournament and the NCAA basketball tournament to keep themselves entertained during recovery. Vasectomies are likely to produce tenderness, discomfort and slight swelling and the patient is usually able to return to usual activities within a week.","Urologists report a higher demand for vasectomies in recent months .

"(CNN) -- If you're looking for love and not having much luck, maybe you could increase your success by getting a bit more passionate -- about helping others. Dave Chung and Kim Benty share a love of volunteer work in New Orleans. When singles write to advice columnists complaining about being lonely, they are often urged to volunteer. Duane Bates, the public relations director for Habitat for Humanity, says it's not unusual for their volunteers to meet on a building site and ""end up together."" Victor Fasolino was living in New Jersey and his future wife, Lora, was living in Seattle, Washington, when the two met in Hungary in 1996 while volunteering on a Jimmy Carter Work Project for Habitat. ""I thought she was an attractive young lady,"" recalls Victor Fasolino, adding that they were working 10-12 hour days so it wasn't until the project was almost complete that they got to spend much time together. Both were committed volunteers and had signed up for a Habitat fundraising bike ride of 500 miles two weeks after they returned to the United States. They got to know each other while pedaling from Kentucky to Atlanta, Georgia. The two got married one year later atop a house they helped build during another project in Pikesville, Kentucky. Other volunteers had cleaned and scraped a ladder so the bride wouldn't get her wedding gown dirty climbing to the roof. The groom wore a tuxedo, a local minister officiated and a fiddler joined them on the roof to provide the music. This year, Victor, 56, and Lora Fasolino, 46, will again work on former President Carter's 2009 Habitat work project, building houses in five countries: Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos and China -- along the Mekong River in southeast Asia. In 2007, Dave Chung and Kim Benty found each other while helping Hurricane Katrina victims in New Orleans, Louisiana. Chung had been a pro golfer playing mini-tours in California and living half the year in Toronto, Ontario, when he got the urge to drive down to New Orleans to volunteer. ""I really liked the place, and the people,"" says Chung. ""The original plan was to come down here for two months and go to a friend's wedding, but I ended up staying."" At first the 30-something golfer worked for Habitat for Humanity, learning plumbing and wiring. Then he went to work with Liz McCartney, 2008 CNN Hero of the Year, at the St. Bernard Project. Meanwhile, Kim Benty, 36, an interpreter for the deaf in the western New York town of Batavia, began a series of trips in July 2007 to work with volunteers in the same area. Benty was smitten after meeting Chung on her first trip, but he merely smiled and went back to work. ""He was doing a little of everything, a runner, bringing supplies, our construction manager,"" Benty remembers. ""I thought, you know, I am just another volunteer to him."" There were several more trips, a few chance meetings -- but no sparks. But something changed when they met yet again in December 2008 at a friend's Christmas party. ""We just hit it off that night,"" Chung says. Chung says he was attracted to her for a million little reasons: ""She's attractive, fun to be around and both of us are kind of easygoing."" But then it was time for Benty to go back to New York and for Chung to make the long drive to Canada to see his relatives. Chung's New Year's Eve plans fell though, so he asked Benty about coming down. They hung out for a few days and Chung was set to drive by himself back to New Orleans. ""She hopped in the car with me, and came down. It really surprised the people who knew her,"" Chung says, ""because she is the kind of person who likes to plan everything."" ""Ha, it did surprise people,"" Benty admits. ""I am very conservative, a planner, it was out of context for me."" They both admit they are at a crossroads of sorts. Psychologist Diana Kirschner, author of the book, ""Love in 90 Days,"" says the couple's relationship could go either way. ""I've seen couples come together in some kind of mission or some kind of movement, and they work together really well when they're within the mission. There's a sense of a bond because of their joint commitment to the mission,"" says Kirschner. ""But then when the mission ends, or if it ends, they just look at each other and find they have nothing in common."" ""However, I've also seen it where couples come together like this and basically decide to stay on the mission the rest of their lives. And they marry and they stay on the mission. Their marriage is all about being together and helping each other fulfill their purpose in this mission,"" Kirschner says. That's what happened to Carol and John Coonrod, who met in 1985 while working for several weeks in Washington on a book promotion for the The Hunger Project, an organization dedicated to ending hunger and poverty in the world. ""The last night when we all went out for a drink, we kind of looked at each other and noticed who we'd been working with all that time -- and we've been together ever since,"" said Carol Coonrod, 62, adding that her husband, 57, always says, ""We're living happily ever after."" The couple, who have no children, are both on staff at the organization. ""We've had a relationship that was formed within The Hunger Project and that has always been our senior mission, part of a senior commitment,"" said Carol Coonrod. ""And within that we've created a partnership and a marriage."" Their shared passion for their work has driven them during their more than two-decade marriage. ""As we've gotten older, we've sort of rediscovered the rest of life and we've continued to be partners, not only in work, but also in our leisure and the rest of our life. We're wonderfully compatible and enjoy vacation and nonwork time as much as working together,"" says the veteran volunteer. The younger volunteer couple is still pondering their relationship. ""We're not trying to put pressure on ourselves, we are trying to have a good time,"" Chung says. But they are certain about one thing. ""Our passion is to be down here with the St. Bernard Project,"" says Benty. ""You know, that is how life works,"" Chung said. ""It works in strange ways. Stuff you don't plan on is the stuff you remember.""","Couple who met working with Habitat for Humanity gets married atop house .

"(Mental Floss) -- Almost everyone knows that each state of the Union has its own flag. State flags, however, are just the most visible elements of an elaborate, esoteric system of legalized symbols that characterize and codify our united states. It's time we were all exposed to the bizarre symbology of state identity-politics. Texas' state flower, the bluebonnet, is celebrated in the Texas state song. To begin with, some of the most well-known state symbols allude to lesser-known meanings and histories. I grew up in Wisconsin and only recently learned that the Badger State title originally refers not to Bucky, nor to the savage beast itself, but to lead miners in the 1820s and 30s. These miners moved from prospect to prospect in southwestern Wisconsin, traveling light and often, with little money for luxury. When winter came and conditions worsened, those miners too far from home to migrate would dig themselves sheltering caves in the hills -- like badgers. These temporary dwellings could be abandoned if a prospect proved fruitless, without much regret; and if the lead pickings were good, the lucky miner could fluff up his badger hole or upgrade to a more traditional Euro-American residence. For this practice Wisconsin miners were dubbed ""badgers"" -- a jibe that was soon appropriated as a proud, statewide nickname. Bucky didn't come along until 1949; the furry, quadruped badger, notoriously vicious when cornered, wasn't declared Wisconsin's state animal until 1957. Other miners migrated south for the winter to the far end of Illinois, much like the region's sucker fish; which earned them the nickname of Suckers, and their state of Illinois its unenviable nickname, The Sucker State. Mental Floss: How 22 colleges got their nicknames . 'Rebel' woodpecker . The state bird of Alabama has another tale behind it. They honor a little woodpecker they call the yellowhammer, which is known outside of Alabama as the northern flicker, the common flicker, or simply The Flicker. (It eats a lot of ants, and is not to be confused with the yellowhammer bunting of Europe and New Zealand.) State birds are chosen for reasons many and varied, some meaningful and others frivolous -- from the pretty songs they sing to their proximity to extinction -- and I believe this is the only bird singled out for its resemblance to Confederate uniforms. The story goes that a clean, trim, flashy bunch of new Confederate recruits one day passed by a weary, bedraggled, dusty pod of veterans, and their fresh uniforms, grey tinged with brilliant yellow, reminded some jokester vet of the woodpecker, so he let out a mocking call: ""Yallerhammer, yallerhammer, flicker, flicker!"" The jeer stuck, and the recruits were soon labeled the Yellowhammer Company. Later, as these things go, all Alabama troops were known as Yellowhammers, the whole state as the Yellowhammer State, and Confederate veterans developed a habit of wearing yellow feathers in their caps and lapels to dress up for post-war reunions. How entertaining and informative. But the real fun starts when these state symbols more shamelessly approach the ridiculous. Let us consider some of the finest specimens: . Eat and drink to the honor of the state . Most states have at least one form of official food. In Louisiana, the official doughnut is the beignet. (I'm unaware of any other state doughnuts -- and I'm disappointed.) New York's official muffin is made with apples; Minnesota's with blueberries; and none have yet found it fit to honor the vegan bran and raisin muffin, despite whatever strange wonders it works on the abdominal tubing. Vermont is the only state with an official flavor: maple, as in maple syrup -- but because they've designated the ""flavor,"" not the ""syrup,"" we can assume the appointment includes everything from maple-glaze for ham to autumnal maple lattes. Shockingly, Oklahoma has recognized a complete (and daunting) meal: fried okra, squash, cornbread, barbeque pork, biscuits, sausage and gravy, grits, corn, chicken friend steak, black-eyed peas, strawberries, and pecan pies. Mental Floss: 6 food challenges for the super hungry . As for state drinks, Nebraska has Kool-Aid, Indiana has water (hubris!), and Alabama, the standout, has Conecuh Ridge Alabama Fine Whiskey -- a re-creation of some well-regarded illegal moonshine made in the backwoods by a man named Clyde May. Silly, sentimental, and insulting songs . All states have songs, too, except New Jersey. Most states have more than one. There are state ballads, state marches, state waltzes, and so on. Connecticut has a state cantata (a narrative piece intermixed with solos and choruses); Louisiana has a state environmental song (""The Gifts of the Earth""); Massachusetts a polka (""Say Hello to Someone from Massachusetts""); a couple states have lullabies; and Ohio has an official rock song, ""Hang On Sloopy."" Two state anthems, Maryland's and Iowa's, are set to the familiar tune of ""O Tannenbaum!"", or ""O Christmas Tree!""; but no states have designated official Christmas songs. And despite Texas' tough boy image (their official footwear is the cowboy boot), it's the only state with an official flower song -- in praise of its state flower, the bluebonnet. Many of the traditional states songs are brazenly effusive. Arizona's begins, ""I love you, Arizona,"" and continues, rather romantically, ""You're the magic in me."" California's is similar, without the magic: ""I love you, California, you're the greatest state of all."" South Dakotans use the superlative when singing to ""The state we love the best."" Usually they're just hilarious, but a few of these songs bear some heinously outdated lyrics. With a nod to the old Eternal Feminine, North Carolina praises its women as Queens of the Forest, ""So graceful, so constant, yet to gentlest breath trembling."" The real trouble comes, though, with old minstrel tunes that portray humble ""darkies"" praising ""old Massa"" in song and romanticizing their cotton-picking servitude. Kentucky changed the language for ""My Old Kentucky Home"" in 1986 to glaze over such indiscretions. But Virginia still seems to have trouble acknowledging its error, and simply demoted its song, ""Carry Me Back To Old Virginny,"" to the status of ""state song emeritus."" Virginia still seeks an adequate replacement, preferably one that doesn't idealize slavery. Every state for itself . Besides these strange variations on common themes, many states have even more idiosyncratic symbols. Since 1962, the official sport of Maryland has been jousting, and more recently, the state's official ""exercise"" was declared to be walking. Not even mall-walking or speed-walking -- just ""walking."" Kentucky doesn't have a ""sport,"" but it does have an official tug-of-war: the Fordsville Tug-of-War Championship. Mississippi has a state toy, the teddy bear; Massachusetts a state bean, the navy bean; and Oklahoma proudly boasts the only state cartoon character, a gust of wind named Gusty that was used to report weather and news, between 1954 and 1989. Mental Floss: State nickname quiz . While many designations seem absurd, most aim to represent some definite aspect of a state's intended ""character."" Legislators want icons that mean something, that give you a sense of the land and its people -- something like the bolo tie. Arizona named the bolo tie its official neckwear back in 1971. And more recently, in 2007, New Mexico added the same to its list of emblems. Apparently, it was an Arizona silversmith who invented the string-and-buckle necktie when he took off his hatband to avoid losing the precious buckle during a high-wind horse ride, and hung it around his neck. This discovery occurred as late as 1940, but the bolo's become such an icon that it's hard to imagine a Wild West without it. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

""I wanted to come here, and I wanted to see my kids graduate from this school district."" But they hardly had a chance. Instead, fighting back tears, she says, ""I have to get out."" Brown and her family are being evicted not because of anything they did, but because her landlord defaulted on the mortgage and the house fell into foreclosure. The house was recently sold at auction. The bad news came just seven months after Brown had moved in. A real estate broker came to the door and handed her an eviction notice, telling her she had 30 days to vacate. ""I was hysterical, I was like, what do you mean?"" Watch Lisa Brown's talk about why she has to move »  The broker explained that the landlord no longer owns the property and that the lease was no longer valid. Brown had no idea the house was in foreclosure.  As a tenant, she always paid her rent on time, and she assumed the rent was going toward the mortgage. ""I didn't see there was a problem,"" she said. ""You know, I'm paying rent, and she's putting it toward her mortgage, I didn't see the problem."" Unfortunately, Brown is not the only tenant caught off guard. According to the Center for Housing Policy, nearly 20 percent of all foreclosures are on rental properties, and tenants' rights in such situations are minimal.   In most states, when a bank forecloses on a landlord, the tenant has no guarantee of being allowed to stay in the property, and neither the bank nor the landlord has a legal obligation to tell the tenant about the foreclosure. So while the owners know what's going on, renters are usually kept in the dark. New York State Sen. Jeff Klein is aware that renters can run into problems. ""In many instances, they're actually paying their rent on time, and the owner of the property who is in foreclosure is pocketing the money,"" he says. Klein says rental properties are involved in 50 percent of all foreclosures in New York, and he is working on a law to warn renters of foreclosure proceedings ahead of time and to keep them from losing their security deposit and being evicted with nowhere to go. Similar laws are already in place in Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Maryland, Rhode Island, Michigan and California. ""What we're facing here"", Klein says, ""is sort of the new homeless population unless we do something about it."" Brown was astonished to learn that her landlord rented her the house when she knew she was losing it. ""She knew that this house was foreclosing on her. She did nothing about it. Nothing, except take my money."" Brown was paying $1,900 a month in rent. She had also paid $5,700 for a security deposit and broker fees to secure the house. She says that money is gone. ""She will not give me my deposit back. Nothing."" CNN tried to reach the owner, who lives upstairs, for comment, but her phone was disconnected, and no one answered the door. The broker who rented her the house and who was paid $1,900 says he did not know the house was in foreclosure. He also says the brokerage fee will not be returned. ""It took everything I had to move in,"" Brown says, ""to give my kids a better environment."" And now, ""I'm left out with nothing."" Because eviction papers trump the lease, Brown has no legal right to stay. The bank that foreclosed on the house, and now owns it, offered her $1,000 to get out, but she says she's lost close to $6,000 and has nowhere to go. ""If it was me, yeah I could move out and go on my own. But it's my family you're talking about, my children, my three daughters and my pets, that I brought in here thinking that we were going to stay and be happy."" Brown is considering suing the owner in small-claims court to get her money back and cover moving expenses. For now, though, she says she will adjust her dreams and find another place for her family to live.","Mortgage meltdown affects renter Lisa Brown after landlord is foreclosed upon .

"The second most-dreaded question for new parents after ""Is your baby sleeping?"" (Answer: ""Well, yes, for forty-five-minute stretches, but not during the night, and only after I conduct a two-hour-long routine including feeding, swaddling, singing, rocking, and an ancient tribal sleep dance"") is ""Where does he sleep?"" Some say a baby should never sleep in the same bed as you, while others say it's the only way to go. That's because the response is usually just as complicated and the people who ask are often ready to pass judgment on it. At least, that's what more than 6,000 of you told us in our national survey about sleep habits, in which we set out to determine the differences between parents who put their babies down to sleep at night in a crib (for convenience's sake, we're calling them ""crib-sleepers"") and those who share a family bed with their children (co-sleepers). Here, an illuminating peek into the night lives of new families: . ""Now, that's crazy!"" When we were creating this survey, we imagined a giant pillow fight, with moms on one side of the bed yelling ""Safety!"" and a posse on the other shouting ""Bonding!"" And we did hear those battle cries: Nearly half of all crib-sleepers admitted that they think co-sleepers are ""irresponsible"" and that parents who share a family bed are ""putting their baby's life at risk."" Parenting.com: Guide to baby sleep . Another 39 percent think that co-sleeping parents are spoiling their baby. ""I know people who still have a three-year-old in bed with them because the kid won't sleep alone. Now, that's crazy!"" exclaims Patty Queen, a mom of two in Marion, North Carolina. ""Come on, people, you are only making it hard on the kids by keeping them in the bed with you."" Another crib proponent, Esther Tune of Henderson, Nevada, considers co-sleeping to be ""the easy option."" ""I never brought my kids into my bed -- even though it would have been easier. I believe they're safer in their own crib."" So what about the safety issue? In a 2005 policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) warned that bed-sharing was associated with an increase in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and strongly recommended against the practice. ""There is no evidence that co-sleeping can be done safely,"" adds John Kattwinkel, M.D., chairperson of the AAP's Task Force on SIDS. Parenting.com: Baby sleep strategies . No wonder moms who co-sleep are twice as likely to feel judged compared with crib-sleepers. In their defense, co-sleepers cite the work of James McKenna, Ph.D., an anthropologist whose research shows SIDS rates to be lower in countries where co-sleeping is the norm, and the attachment-parenting theories of Babytalk contributing editor William Sears, M.D. (Both experts believe parents can -- and must -- co-sleep safely; see Askdrsears.com for guidelines.) Parenting.com: Why are infants still dying from SIDS? In fact, co-sleepers were just as likely to choose their sleeping arrangement for safety reasons as crib-sleepers. And they also slung some arrows: 40 percent of moms who planned to co-sleep believe that parents who use a crib won't have as close a bond with their babies as they do; another 20 percent feel that crib-sleepers are ""selfish"" and ""only thinking of their own sleep."" ""Babies grow up more secure when they sleep with their moms for the first year of their lives,"" contends Phasinee Brown of Kansas City, Kansas. Parenting.com: Learning to sleep solo . Giving up control . The majority of parents agreed, however, that in the quest for rest, one size does not fit all babies. ""After having three children,"" Trenny Suggs of Spring Hill, Tennessee, told us, ""I have learned that you have to do whatever is necessary to help your children sleep."" And for many of you, that means changing your game plan. According to our results, only 11 percent of moms actually planned to co-sleep with their babies, but a whopping 42 percent ended up doing so once their little bundles arrived (see ""Best-Laid Plans"" on the previous page). ""During my pregnancy, I studied controversial topics, such as co-sleeping, and thought I knew what I would do,"" shared one reader in California, who swore that she wouldn't co-sleep but now spends every night in bed with her 5-month-old daughter. ""But children set their own schedules. I never understood that having a baby means giving up complete control."" Parenting.com: Dreaming of sleep . The perfect sleep solution . For all the stress that surrounds getting your baby to sleep, it's helpful to remember -- in a twisted sort of way, we admit -- that 51 percent of you report being tired all the time, regardless of whether your tot snoozes in a crib or in your bed. In other words, there's no right or wrong answer to that frustrating question ""Where does your baby sleep?"" As Jaclyn Petrin of Princeton, New Jersey, said, ""I hope this survey helps parents understand that there is no perfect sleep solution. If there is, please let me know what it is.""

"(CNN) -- An Indonesian fisherman has been killed by Komodo dragons after he was attacked while trespassing on a remote island in search of fruit, officials said Tuesday. Komodo dragons kill their prey with an extremely toxic bite. Muhamad Anwar, 32, bled to death on his way to hospital after being mauled by the reptiles at Loh Sriaya, in eastern Indonesia's Komodo National Park, the park's general manager Fransiskus Harum told CNN. ""The fisherman was inside the park when he went looking for sugar-apples. The area was forbidden for people to enter as there are a lot of wild dragons,"" Harum said. Other fisherman took Anwar to a clinic on nearby Flores Island, east of Bali, but he was declared dead on arrival, he added. Komodo dragons, the world's heaviest lizards, can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet) in length and have a toxic bite that they use to kill prey such as buffalo, returning to feast when the animal succumbs to the poison. Despite their ungainly appearance, the carnivorous reptiles can run as fast as a dog in short bursts, jump up on their hind legs, and kill animals with a blow of their powerful tails. Attacks on humans are rare, but Monday's incident is the latest in a series in which the monster lizards -- which have forked tongues and fearsome claws --have killed or injured people. Last month a park ranger survived after a Komodo dragon climbed the ladder into his hut and savaged his hand and foot. In 2007 an eight-year-old boy died after being mauled. In June last year, a group of divers who were stranded on an island in the national park -- the dragons' only natural habitat -- had to fend off several attacks from the reptiles before they were rescued. Park rangers also tell the cautionary tale of a Swiss tourist who vanished leaving nothing but a pair of spectacles and a camera after an encounter with the dragons several years ago. An endangered species, Komodo are believed to number less than 4,000 in the wild. Access to their habitat is restricted, but tourists can get permits to see them in the wild within the National Park. All visitors are accompanied by rangers, about 70 of whom are deployed across the park's 60,000 hectares of vegetation and 120,000 hectares of ocean. Despite a threat of poachers, Komodo dragon numbers are believed to have stabilized in recent years, bolstered by successful breeding campaigns in captivity. On Monday, a zoo in Surabaya on the Indonesian island of Java reported the arrival of 32 newborn Komodos after the babies all hatched in the past two weeks, the Jakarta Post reported.","Fisherman was trespassing on island when dragons attacked .

"(CNN) -- Some 5,000 residents in eastern Pennsylvania were allowed to return to their homes Saturday afternoon, some 12 hours after they were evacuated when a tractor-trailer carrying 33,000 pounds of toxic hydrofluoric acid overturned after the driver tried to avoid a deer, authorities said. Traffic is backed up Saturday after a truck spilled hydrofluoric acid in eastern Pennsylvania. State police identified the driver as Raymond Leblanc, 54, of Harrow, Ontario, Canada. Leblanc, who initially was trapped in the truck, was taken to a hospital where he was treated and released. Police said a passenger in the truck was unhurt. No other injuries were reported. The truck flipped over on its side and slid along northbound State Road 33, which was closed in both directions from Belfast to Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, from the time of the early-morning accident until about 6 p.m. Saturday. Most of the acid in the tank was in the form of pressurized gas, but there also was some water, said Northampton County spokesman John Conklin. State and federal hazardous materials experts stopped the leak by noon. The wreck occurred at 3:30 a.m. near Wind Gap. Conklin said many evacuees -- those living within a mile of the accident site in Plainfield Township -- went to a shelter set up at nearby Pen Argyl High School in Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania. A dispatcher with the Northhampton County Division of Emergency Management said residents were allowed to begin returning to their homes about 3:45 p.m. Saturday. Hydrogen fluoride is a hazardous chemical compound used mainly for industrial purposes such as etching glass, and is extremely corrosive. It also is an ingredient in high-octane gasoline, refrigerants, aluminum and light bulbs. Contact with concentrated solutions can cause severe burns, according to medical authorities. Inhaling the gas causes respiratory irritation, severe eye damage and pulmonary edema.","5,000 evacuees able to go home 12 hours after evacuated because of acid spill .

"SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir (CNN) -- Ten people in the disputed territory of Kashmir have been killed in ongoing gunfights between militants and Indian troops, an Indian defense spokesman said Sunday. Indian soldiers stand guard in Srinagar. ""So far we have lost an army officer and three troopers, while six militants have been gunned down by the army in past three days,"" Indian defense spokesman, Lt. Col. J.S. Brar told CNN on Sunday. The fighting started after troops were tipped off about the presence of heavily armed militants in the region. Security forces encircled a forested region to close in on the militants. Militants opened fire at the troops and both sides traded fire. ""The operations are being conducted in a densely forested and highly foliaged mountain range,"" Brar said. The gun battle is the second-longest of the year in Kashmir after the nearly seven-day-long encounter in the mountainous Poonch district of Jammu region in Indian-administered Kashmir in January. The onset of summer and melting of snows in mountain passes often leads to increased influx of militants from across the Line of Control, police said. The Line of Control is the border in Kashmir between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled region of the disputed province. The other day, India said, Pakistani troops had opened indiscriminate and unprovoked fire at its positions in northern Kashmir along the Line of Control. One trooper was injured. Kashmir has endured a violent separatist campaign for nearly 20 years, and authorities say 43,000 people have been killed. However, various non-governmental organizations and rights groups put the number of dead at twice the official count.","10 dead in Kashmir gunfights between Indian troops, separatist militants .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British reality TV celebrity Jade Goody died early Sunday morning following a public battle with cervical cancer, her publicist has announced. Jade Goody married her fiance Jack Tweed weeks before her death. Goody, 27, died in her sleep at home in Essex, east of London, just before 4 a.m. (midnight Eastern Daylight Time), a spokeswoman for Max Clifford Associates said. Goody's husband, Jack Tweed, who she married last month in a lavish wedding ceremony, was at her bedside when she died, Clifford said. Her mother, Jackiey Budden, who was also at the house, said: ""My beautiful daughter is at peace."" Goody leaves behind two sons, Bobby, 5, and Freddie, 4, by former boyfriend and TV host Jeff Brazier. ""She died knowing that she had touched a lot of hearts and minds across the world,"" Clifford told CNN by phone from Portugal. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was ""deeply saddened"" by Goody's death. ""Her family can be extremely proud of the work she has done to raise awareness of cervical cancer which will benefit thousands of women across the U.K. Every death from cancer is a tragedy and my thoughts go out to her two sons, husband and family at this time,"" Brown said in a statement. The British media has reported a rise in the number of screenings for cervical cancer since Goody announced she had the disease, a phenomenon some have dubbed the ""Jade Goody effect."" Goody's death marks the tragic end to a very modern tale. Images of her shrinking frame and bald head have dominated the pages of British media since she announced she had just weeks to live. However, she has openly courted the attention since bursting into the spotlight courtesy of the British version of ""Big Brother"" in 2002. At first the former dental nurse was a hate figure for Britain's vociferous tabloid newspapers, who attacked her for being ignorant and stupid. The public, however, warmed to her loud, honest streak. She did not win the series, but was able to parlay her popularity into a series of reality television and business deals. Her face was soon regularly boldly looking out from the cover of gossip magazines and you could buy the fragrance Shh... Jade Goody, fitness DVDs or pick up a copy of her autobiography. In 2007, with her fame starting to dip, she agreed to return for the celebrity edition of ""Big Brother,"" with her mother and then boyfriend, Jack Tweed, joining her in the house. It was to prove an ill-fated decision. Goody was soon accused of making racist comments and bullying her housemate -- the Indian actress Shilpa Shetty. More than 50,000 complaints were received. When she was voted out of the house the show's producers took the unusual step of banning the public from attending her eviction. Goody was tearful and apologetic but British PR guru Clifford summed up the general opinion at the time by saying: ""It looks like she has ruined a very lucrative career."" Ever resilient, Goody had a Christmas cookbook out at the end of 2007 and in 2008 signed up for India's version of ""Big Brother."" Two days into the show her cancer diagnosis was revealed on air. She flew home immediately to begin treatment. Last month Goody revealed her cancer was terminal and that she only had weeks to live. With typical bravado she, with Clifford's help, organized her wedding to Tweed, who had only just been released from prison after serving a sentence for assault, selling the exclusive rights to OK! magazine for a reported $970,000. It was also filmed for her reality TV show. Read blog about how media covered wedding . The British government even stepped in to extend Tweed's 7 p.m. curfew, a condition of his release from jail, so the couple could spend their wedding night together.  Watch Jade Goody's wedding preparations » . Despite her weakening state Goody continued to open her door to the media, saying she needed to keep selling her story to help secure the future of her sons. In the days leading up to her death there were newspaper stories on a hammer-wielding woman getting into her room, the baptism of her sons, her last view of ""sun-kissed"" fields and final farewells with family. There was also controversy when OK! published a memorial issue nearly a week before she died. The issue, with a coverline announcing ""Jady Goody, 1981-2009,"" went on sale Tuesday. Clifford said Goody had loved her time in the spotlight. ""I think they've (she and the media) exploited each other. Both have benefited. In Jade's own words, she's loved the last 7 years. They've been wonderful. All the people's she's met, all the things she's done.""

"NEW YORK -- For more than 10 years, Mandy Hughes drifted in an out of what she calls the horrible, debilitating pain of Lyme disease. Mandy Hughes says the pain she suffered for more than 10 years was due to Lyme disease . ""It literally feels like you got into a severe accident, like you were hit by a Mack truck and you were allowed no medical attention,"" she says. After being bitten by a tick at 19, Hughes broke out in hives and suffered fever and chills so severe that she had to be hospitalized. She was diagnosed with Lyme disease and was sent home with two weeks' worth of the antibiotic tetracycline. She seemed to be cured. But over the years, the Lyme symptoms flared back -- crippling joint pain, muscle spasms, headaches and facial paralysis. She visited 15 doctors, yet they were unable to arrive at a diagnosis. Several thought she had multiple sclerosis. Others knew she was sick but didn't know why. Lyme had been ruled out. ""Maybe it's psychological -- we don't really have an explanation,"" they told Hughes. ""Your tests are coming back fine, Mandy.""  Watch a report on a 10-year battle with Lyme disease symptoms » . The memory of one doctor's visit stays with her to this day. She went to see him with joint pain so severe, she said, her hands were curled into a palsy-like position. Yet the doctor seemed impatient with her. ""You're obviously an attractive woman, and you're just trying to get attention,"" she recalls him saying. In 2005, Hughes went to see what some patients refer to as a ""Lyme-literate"" doctor -- one willing to diagnose chronic Lyme disease and prescribe a long-term regimen of intravenous as well as oral antibiotics. Within three months, she began to feel better. After 15 months, she was back on her feet, but had to abruptly halt treatment when her doctor was sued by an insurance company and stopped seeing patients.  Learn more about Lyme disease » . Hughes' story is featured in a new documentary called ""Under Our Skin,"" which takes a look at the leaders of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, a national medical group that represents health care professionals who specialize in infectious diseases. The society's purpose, according to its Web site, is to improve health care in areas related to such diseases. In particular, the documentary takes aim at the 14-member panel that wrote the 2006 Lyme disease treatment guidelines. The guidelines question the existence of chronic Lyme disease and claim the post-treatment symptoms of some patients appear to be ""more related to the aches and pains of daily living rather than to either Lyme disease or a tickborne coinfection."" The guidelines list specific criteria for diagnosing Lyme -- such as an obvious tick bite, a characteristic bull's-eye rash at the site of the bite, facial paralysis and a positive blood test. Yet some Lyme specialists say many patients experiencing symptoms do not see or remember a tick bite. Only 70 to 80 percent get the rash at all, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The longer the disease goes undiagnosed, the harder it is to treat, some doctors say. ""The disability associated with Lyme disease is worse than the disability that you might see with someone after a heart attack,"" said Brian Fallon, director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University Medical Center in New York. Patient advocates criticize the IDSA for recommending no more than a month's worth of antibiotics to treat Lyme. They say insurance companies use the guidelines to deny payment for long-term antibiotic therapy. But the IDSA says there are inherent risks from such treatment, including localized infection from the IV line and the creation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One IDSA critic, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, conducted an antitrust investigation of the guideline process, saying the panel ignored or minimized other medical opinions regarding chronic Lyme disease. Blumenthal said the process was tainted by conflict of interest because members of the panel consulted for insurance companies and at least one had a patent for a Lyme disease treatment. Gary Wormser, chief of infectious diseases at New York Medical College and one of the guidelines' authors, denies those allegations, calling them ""preposterous."" ""What we did recommend was not treating with unsafe or prolonged courses of antibiotic therapy,"" Wormser said. In a settlement with Blumenthal, the IDSA agreed to reassess its 2006 guidelines with the assistance of an outside arbiter. The heart of the debate is whether patients actually have Lyme disease, or simply symptoms that are mistaken for Lyme disease. ""The problem is that the majority of patients that carry the diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease actually have the same kinds of symptoms: fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, sometimes brain fog. ...  The majority of such patients actually don't have any evidence of ever having had Lyme disease."" Wormser said. There's a lot at stake. The CDC reports approximately 20,000 new cases of Lyme disease a year, with the number doubling from 1991 to 2005. Factoring in underreported cases, the CDC says the actual number could be three to 10 times higher. ""We have an epidemic of Lyme disease,"" said Daniel Cameron, president of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society, which rejects the IDSA guidelines and says the chronic form of the disease may be prevalent in up to 62 percent of the population in areas where Lyme disease is endemic. Fallon says standard blood tests fail to detect the Lyme infection in 20 to 30 percent of patients. ""Most reasonable academic physicians throughout the United States would acknowledge that there's a large number of patients out there who do have chronic, persistent symptoms. The question is, why do they have those symptoms?"" he says.","Mandy Hughes says she suffered from Lyme disease effects for more than 10 years .

"(CNN)  -- Israeli soldiers routinely and intentionally put children in harm's way during their 22-day offensive against the Palestinians in Gaza, according to a United Nations report made public Monday. On March 6, a Palestinian boy sits on the rubble of a building destroyed during Israel's 22-day Gaza offensive. The report said a working group had documented and verified reports of violations ""too numerous to list."" For example, on January 15, in a town southwest of Gaza City, Israel Defense Forces soldiers ordered an 11-year-old boy to open Palestinians' packages, presumably so that the soldiers would not be hurt if they turned out to contain explosives, the 43-page report said. They then forced the boy to walk in front of them in the town, it said. When the soldiers came under fire, ""the boy remained in front of the group,"" the report said. It said the boy was later released. Also cited were ""credible reports"" that accused Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that runs Gaza, of using human shields and placing civilians at risk. But it singled out the Israelis for more sweeping criticism. A spokesman for the Israeli prime minister called the report another example of the ""one-sided and unfair"" attitude of the U.N. Human Rights Council, which requested it. The report cited two alleged incidents from January 3. In one, it said, after a tank round struck near a house, a father and his two sons -- both younger than 11 -- emerged to look at the damage. ""As they exited their home, IDF soldiers shot and killed them (at the entrance to their house), with the daughter witnessing,"" the report said. In the second, it said, ""Israeli soldiers entered a family house in the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City. Standing at the doorstep, they asked the male head of the household to come out and shot him dead, without warning, while he was holding his ID, hands raised up in the air, and then started to fire indiscriminately and without warning into the room where the rest of the family was huddled together. ""The eldest son was shouting in vain the word 'Children' in Hebrew to warn the soldiers. The shooting did not stop until everyone was lying on the floor. The mother and four of the brothers, aged 2-12 years, had been wounded, one of them, aged 4, fatally."" The alleged instances occurred during Operation Cast Lead, which was launched December 27 to halt rocket attacks into southern Israel from Gaza and ended January 17 with a cease-fire. The U.N. report called the response by Israel disproportionate. Of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict, 1,440 were Palestinian, including 431 children and 114 women, the report said. The 13 Israelis killed included three civilians and six soldiers killed by Hamas, and four soldiers killed by friendly fire, it said. The report said the Israeli operation resulted in ""a dramatic deterioration of the living conditions of the civilian population."" It cited ""targeted and indiscriminate"" attacks on hospitals and clinics, water and sewage treatment facilities, government buildings, utilities and farming and said the offensive ""intensified the already catastrophic humanitarian situation of the Palestinian people."" It said Israeli strikes damaged more than 200 schools and left more than 70,000 people homeless. ""There are strong and credible reports of war crimes and other violations of international norms,"" it said, adding that many observers have said war crimes investigations should be undertaken. ""The alternative is de facto impunity,"" it said. It called for the end of Israel's blockade of Gaza and the free passage into the territory of food, medicine, fuel and construction supplies. Mark Regev, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, called the report ""another example of the one-sided and unfair attitude of the rapporteur of the Human Rights Council, a council that has been criticized by current and previous secretaries-general for its unbalanced attitudes toward Israel."" He added, ""The negative fixation on Israel by the council has done a disservice to the issue of human rights internationally as has been attested to by the leading NGO's [nongovernmental organizations] on human rights."" Another report issued Monday also was critical of the IDF. The report from Physicians for Human Rights said the Gaza incursion violated IDF's own code of ethics. The report by the medical group, which shared the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, cited instances where it said IDF forces did not evacuate injured civilians for days and prevented Palestinian teams from reaching the wounded, and said some of them died as a result. It said 16 Palestinian medical personnel were killed by IDF fire and 25 were wounded during the IDF operation, and accused the IDF of attacking 34 medical centers in violation of the IDF's own ""ethical code for fighting terror."" In response, the IDF accused Hamas of having used medical vehicles, facilities and uniforms to conceal its members' activity. ""Hamas used ambulances to 'rescue' terror activists from the battlefield and used hospitals and medical facilities as hiding places,"" the Israelis said in a written statement. ""Despite this, throughout the fighting, IDF forces were instructed to avoid firing at ambulances, even if they were being used by armed fighters. They were instructed only to shoot if there was fire towards our forces emanating from the direction of the ambulance."" Regarding the reported delays in casualty evacuations, ""there existed real difficulties in evacuating the injured, due to the roadblocks, booby-trapped roads and dirt mounds placed by the Hamas as well as the considerable damage to the infrastructure,"" the statement said. Nevertheless, it said, an IDF investigation is ongoing and its conclusions will be made public once it is complete. But Dr. Dani Filc, PHR-Israel chairman, was skeptical that the investigation would prove useful. ""There are considerable doubts that the IDF is the correct institution to investigate suspicions of these violations,"" he said. ""The IDF's repeated promises to the High Court to look into attacks on medical teams and medical centers have gone unfulfilled, and there are suspicions concerning its seriousness and readiness to carry out the matter."" The Israeli military did accept criticism Monday on another matter -- the practice of some Israeli soldiers of wearing T-shirts that appear to condone acts of violence against Palestinians. The Israeli daily Haaretz newspaper reported that Israeli soldiers who had finished basic training ordered the shirts, one of which showed a pregnant Arab in the crosshairs of a gun sight with a caption reading ""1 Shot 2 Kills."" Another showing a small child in a gun's sight was captioned, ""The smaller they are, the harder it is."" ""The examples presented by The Haaretz reporter are not in accordance with IDF values and are simply tasteless,"" the Israeli military said in a written statement. ""This type of humor is unbecoming and should be condemned."" Israeli soldiers said last week that Palestinian civilians were killed and Palestinian property intentionally destroyed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to Haaretz. The IDF has said it is investigating the claims, but its top general expressed skepticism Monday. ""I don't believe that soldiers serving in the IDF hurt civilians in cold blood, but we shall wait for the results of the investigation,"" Lt. Gen. Ashkenazi, the chief of staff, said in a speech. ""I tell you that this is a moral and ideological army."" He blamed Hamas for choosing ""to fight in heavily populated areas. ""It (was) a complex atmosphere that includes civilians and we took every measure possible to reduce harm of the innocent,"" he said, according to an IDF statement.","Israel: U.N.

"(CNN) -- An 8-year-old American boy is caught in the middle of an ugly custody battle so high profile that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is using her clout to try to bring the boy home. David Goldman's legal battle to gain custody of his son has drawn the attention of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In 2004, David Goldman dropped off his wife, Bruna, and then-4-year-old son, Sean, at the airport for a two-week vacation in Brazil. Shortly after she arrived in her native country, Bruna told David she wanted a divorce and planned to stay in Brazil with their son. Bruna later remarried and got pregnant, but she died while giving birth last summer. Goldman thought he was getting his son back, but a Brazilian family court judge granted custody of Sean to Bruna's new husband. Goldman talked with CNN's Larry King about the international legal battle he is waging to gain custody of his son. King also talked to Helvecio Ribeiro, Bruna Goldman's uncle. The following is an edited version of the interviews. Larry King: What caused the breakup of the marriage? David Goldman: I don't know. Apparently, she decided she wanted to live in Brazil, where she said she had more friends and more family and where she was known. King: Did you feel happily married? Goldman: Yes, I thought we were happily married. King: So this was a call out of the blue? Goldman: I was completely blindsided and crushed. King: What did you do then? Goldman: Well, I (got) a phone call. My mom tracked it down as being Father's Day, about three days after they arrived. The first call was they got there safe, everything was OK. Then, I got a phone call and a very serious voice -- a voice they didn't recognize, really, as being, you know, it was out of her normal tone. Bruna says, ""David, we need to talk. You're a great guy. You're a wonderful father, but our love affair is ended, is over. I've decided I want to live in Brazil and you need to come down to Brazil immediately and sign 10 pages of papers with my attorney."" There was a list of demands on these papers. One was giving her full custody. Another was to never go to the courts to file any claims of kidnapping or criminal charges. King: Did you get to talk to your son? Goldman: I got to talk to my son. In fact, I got to speak with all of them in the beginning, while they were still trying to get me to go down there and be trapped in this custody battle. At that point, I wasn't the enemy until I didn't meet her demands and I did go to the courts. King: Well, when you went (to Brazil), who did you see? What did you do? Goldman: I went to the courts. I went to every ruling on every court proceeding and with the guise that they would honor the Hague Treaty and return (my) son. And every time, it just got worse and worse. In the first instance, they kept Sean for over a year before they made this ruling. And then they said, 'Well, you know, yes, he was taken unlawfully and he should have been returned, but now he's settled with the mother. These are Brazilian judges who have admitted that he's been held unlawfully and wrongfully. King: How did you hear she died? Goldman: I have friends who, kind of, have an ear to the ground in Brazil, and there were some articles that came out in some local Brazilian newspapers and they did some on the Internet and said she'd passed away. King: Did you try then to get the child back legally? Goldman: Yes. As soon as I was notified, I called both counsel in Brazil and in the U.S., and they said it should be over. You know, we have stacks of court records and all these treaties and it's always been about Bruna and David, Bruna and David. There's no more Bruna. By all matters of law, international and national and Brazilian law, no one has a legal claim of custody but the living, biological parent. Go down to Brazil and bring your son home. King: What happened in court? Goldman: In this past court, we finally got a visitation ruling. But when I went down the first time to bring my son home, we find out that this man doesn't file custody, but he files to remove my name from a Brazilian birth certificate that they had issued for my son, who was born in Red Bank, New Jersey. And with that, they gave him a provisionary guardianship -- a provisionary. King: Obviously, he wanted the boy? Goldman: Obviously. King: When you were (with him? Goldman: Oh, he was -- I just saw him this last February for the first time. King:  At eight years old, did he ask you why he's not with you? Goldman: He asked why I haven't come to see him in all this time. And that was very, very painful -- and the anguish on his face when he asked me that question. And I didn't want to tell him that the situation that I'm not allowed -- that they weren't allowing me, they're holding him. So I just told him that I had been there many times with his grandmother, with his grandfather, with his cousins, with family friends to see him, sometimes staying for up to two weeks and the courts -- it was difficult. King: How long did you have with him? Goldman: I saw him for two days a total of about six hours. King: How did you say goodbye? Goldman: It was very, very difficult. I just kept telling him the whole time how much I love him, how much I miss him. King: Did you tell him you were going to try to get him back? Goldman: No. I told him I'm going to always try to be with him. I don't want him to be put in any type of awkward situation or uncomfortable situation. I just told him I love him, I miss him and everyone at home loves him. And he remembers things at home. We spoke English. King: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has raised the Goldman case with the Brazilian government. Anything you'd say to her? Goldman: I'm just -- I'm so grateful and thankful that -- that she's helping me and she knows what's right and sees what's right and she cares about children and parents' rights to be with their own flesh and blood. - - - - - - - - - - - - . King followed the Goldman interview by talking to Helvecio Ribeiro, Bruna Goldman's uncle. King: Why do you think that David should not have his son? Why shouldn't he have his -- it's his son. Ribeiro: That's right. And I don't question the biological right. The fact of the matter is that in order to be a parent, you have to be more than just a DNA donor, Mr. King. Fatherhood is not about making home movies and taking pictures, it's about sacrifice. It's about providing support to your child. It's about being there even when you're not there. And Mr. Goldman, while Bruna was still alive, failed to do so. I'm not sure if you know that, but he hasn't paid one single dime of child support so far. And he has been making allegations all over the place about us not allowing him to visit his child. They are completely untrue. King: Do you question whether David loves his child? Ribeiro: Oh, absolutely. I think that it's really easy to say that you love someone, but you have to act and show that. Mr. Goldman never had any interest on actually going down to Brazil, even to visit. I mean the child is not guilty of his parents' mistakes. I mean divorces happen all the time. And the parents should be responsible and work their way toward finding an agreement in which, you know, both parents are part of the children's lives. And he failed to do that because it was not in his best interests. King: How close is he [Sean's stepfather] with Sean? Ribeiro: Very close. Sean knows exactly that he is not his biological father, but he also calls him Daddy. Sean knows that, you know, Mr. Goldman is his biological father. Even though it was not mentioned during this interview, Sean normally talks to Mr. Goldman or at least used to talk to Mr. Goldman and also her -- his grandmother here in the United States. So he knows exactly the difference. He knows exactly who is who.","David Goldman's wife, Bruna, took son to Brazil, asked for divorce .

"CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (CNN) -- Nine bodies have been found in a common grave in the desert south of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, according to Chihuahua state prosecutor's spokeswoman Daniela Gonzalez. Police look on as one of the nine bodies found in a common grave near Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, is removed. Investigators have yet to determine the identities of the seven men and two women found in the grave, Gonzalez said. They have not released information on how they were killed or how long they have been there. Juarez, which is across the border from El Paso, Texas, has become one of the major battlegrounds as drug cartels fight both each other and Mexican authorities. The conflict has made violence increasingly common in Juarez, Tijuana and other Mexican border towns. Extreme violence among warring drug cartels and the Mexican government has long plagued Juarez and the state of Chihuahua, but the situation has been getting worse. Last month, the city's chief of police was obliged to quit after threats from organized crime to kill a policeman every day that he remained on the job.  Watch as mayor of Juarez talks about who is responsible for slayings » . Earlier this month, the U.S. Consulate in Juarez specifically warned Americans to avoid an area southeast of the city. The discovery of the bodies comes as 5,000 Mexican soldiers are descending this weekend on Juarez in an effort to end the violence that has claimed more than 400 lives so far this year. Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz told CNN he is hopeful Operacion Conjunto Chihuahua (Chihuahua Joint Operation) will be successful. ""The reality is that the military presence in the last several weeks has caused the violence to subside,"" he said. ""We were averaging about 10 murders a week; and since February 26, when the troops starting arriving, we have been averaging about one."" Enrique Torres, spokesman for the Chihuahua Joint Operation, said by Sunday there will be 7,500 military personnel, 2,300 federal police and 1,600 city police working together to patrol the city and aggressively fight the cartels. ""We are launching a full frontal attack"" Torres said. ""We will also be tackling other types of organized crime -- money laundering and kidnappings."" Corruption among the police force has been a major concern to local and international authorities. Torres said the city has been preparing for a year to ""clean up the local police.""  Watch panel discuss escalating drug war » . Already, he said, more than 500 city police officers have been fired because they failed to pass the ""trust test."" As part of the ""clean-up,"" federal authorities have been requiring officers to take a polygraph test. To prevent corruption among the just arrived soldiers, Torres said they will be frequently rotated. ""They will only work in the region one to two months and then they will be sent to other parts of the country."" Ferriz, the mayor, said government officials are doing everything in their power to stop the violence; they have brought in consultants from Colombia and adapted programs that have proven successful there, such as a civilian corruption watchdog program. But he explained that a big part of the problem is coming from the north. ""The majority of the weapons used for homicides here have been identified as coming from the United States"" he said. Ferriz said that during a recent raid, local police confiscated two .50-caliber military-style rifles. Some weeks later they arrested another man bringing in another .50-caliber rifle. ""He bought it off the internet in the U.S.,"" Ferrez said. ""It is so easy there for organized crime to get access to these types of weapons. The arms and cash contraband into Mexico from the United States must be stopped."" Ferriz siad he plans to travel next week to Washington to meet with U.S. lawmakers about the security situation in and around Juarez.","Nine bodies found are found in a common grave near Ciudad Juarez, Mexico .
Bodies of seven men and two women have not been identified, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- The power of the Mexican military was on full display Tuesday in Ciudad Juarez, where police reported the third consecutive day without a drug slaying. A federal police officer guards a checkpoint earlier this month in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico . Ten drug-related killings in a single day were common before 9,500 army troops poured into the blood-soaked border town in the past few weeks, said Mauricio Mauricio, a spokesman for the Juarez municipal police. ""It's a much more secure city at this moment,"" he said. ""We haven't had murders with the same regularity and frequency as before."" But as President Obama's administration announced plans Tuesday to beef up U.S. security along its border with Mexico, there are questions about whether increased military and police efforts in both nations can yield long-term results. Mexico has been spiraling into a deepening pit of violence, with 6,500 people killed in 2008 and the body count continuing apace this year. Most of that violence is occurring along the border, which worries Washington. Mexican President Felipe Calderon and others have said recently that the United States must share responsibility because the demand for drugs and most of the weapons used by drug cartels comes from north of the border. The drug war and security will be a major topic when U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Mexico on Wednesday and Thursday. Andrew Selee, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Mexico Institute, called Obama's pledge on Tuesday to give $700 million in aid to Mexico and assign an additional 360 staff along the border a ""substantive commitment"" that shows the United States is serious about attacking the problem. ""It's an attempt to really put some substance behind the idea of shared responsibility,"" Selee said. ""They finally committed some of the resources they said they would to this."" Success will depend on the follow-through, he said. ""Now is the hard part,"" he said. ""It's not easy to follow the money trail or stop the weapons or the criminal networks."" Others say the Obama plan falls short. Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington policy institute, calls it a ""militarized strategy"" that isn't oriented toward finding solutions based on economic development or social justice programs. ""This is a feel-good strategy that is meant to produce the illusion of concrete developments taking place when it's actually just really more of the same,"" Birns said. ""You're talking about a 2,000-mile border, so the odd 16 [agents] here or 12 there is not going to do the trick."" On the other hand, Mexico's major military commitment is certainly showing short-term benefits. Before the army arrived in Ciudad Juarez, there had been more than 400 drug killings this year, police spokesman Mauricio said. Since the army arrived, slayings have dropped 95 percent, he said. Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue policy institute, says Mexico's use of the army in Juarez -- and its evident success -- ""shows that Mexico is definitely not a failed state. Nobody is going to challenge the government for control of a certain area."" Selee sees it as ""increased determination from the Mexican government to establish order."" But there are limitations to using the military in Mexico, Birns and Hakim said. ""There's bad blood that exists between local communities and the military,"" said Birns. ""The Mexican military has not fought a war for years. It's enemy has always been the local population."" Hakim noted the cost in money, and to the daily fabric of life. ""That's not a cheap way of keeping law and order,"" he said. ""It does a great deal of harm to civilian institutions. The military is not trained to respect human liberties and individual rights."" It's an ambivalence that many Mexicans feel: security versus liberties. Polls consistently show that security is the top concern among a vast majority of Mexicans. And for many Mexican citizens, the drug war can still hit close to home no matter how far away they live from the front lines. Adrian Jesus Garrido Gomez, a 30-year-old bank loan officer with a wife and two young sons, lives in Tabasco state in southern Mexico, far from the violence tearing up Juarez and other border cities. ""Tabasco has always been relatively safe,"" Garrido said by telephone Tuesday. He said a childhood friend worked for 2½ years in a high-paying white-collar job in Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas. When he got married recently, his wife had one request: Let's move back to Tabasco. They did, six months ago. ""For them, it (was) very insecure,"" Garrido said. Reynosa was the site of a four-hour gun battle last month that left five drug traffickers dead and seven police wounded. People worldwide saw video of a television reporter sprawled on a bridge during that fight, trying to file an on-air report over the roar of gunfire. Hakim says Mexican President Calderon's efforts to paint the United States as partially responsible for the violence is lost on some Mexicans. ""In the end,"" Hakim said, ""this is Mexico's problem as much as Mexico talks about a shared problem. The costs of not getting control of it will be paid by the Mexicans.""","Police in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, reported third straight day without a drug slaying .
Questions remain about whether increased security efforts can work long term .
Polls consistently show security is top concern among vast majority of Mexicans .
Distrust of military has long been part of social fabric of Mexican life ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney on Sunday defended the Bush administration's economic record, the invasion of Iraq and the treatment of suspected terrorists, warning that reversing its anti-terrorism policies endangers Americans. ""We've accomplished nearly everything we set out to do,"" ex-Vice President Dick Cheney says Sunday about Iraq. In a wide-ranging interview with CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Cheney said the harsh interrogations of suspects and the use of warrantless electronic surveillance were ""absolutely essential"" to get information to prevent more attacks like the 2001 suicide hijackings that targeted New York and Washington. ""President Obama campaigned against it all across the country, and now he is making some choices that, in my mind, will, in fact, raise the risk to the American people of another attack,"" he said. Critics said the Bush administration's ""alternative"" interrogation techniques amounted to the torture of prisoners in American custody, while the administration's warrantless surveillance program violated federal laws enacted after the Watergate scandal. Since taking office in January, Obama has announced plans to close the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to halt the military trials of suspected terrorists there, and to make CIA officers follow the Army field manual's rules on interrogations. Cheney said the administration appears to be returning to the pre-2001 model of treating terrorism as a law enforcement issue, rather than a military problem. ""When you go back to the law enforcement mode, which I sense is what they're doing, closing Guantanamo and so forth ... they are very much giving up that center of attention and focus that's required, that concept of military threat that is essential if you're going to successfully defend the nation against further attacks,"" he said. But Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pennsylvania, said the Bush administration's policies undercut ""what is actually the source of America's greatness -- our principles."" ""How can we say that keeping a man in a black hole forever -- perpetually in a black hole -- and saying, 'Let's torture when we decide to,' is what America stands for?"" asked Sestak, a former admiral who led the Navy's anti-terrorism efforts. The Bush administration took office at the end of an economic boom and left in the middle of a deep recession, with a budget surplus in 2001 becoming a $1 trillion-plus deficit by 2009. But Cheney said he and Bush had to spend money to deal with the September 11, 2001 attacks, the resulting war in Afghanistan, the disaster of 2005's Hurricane Katrina, and the costly and unpopular war in Iraq, now nearly six years old. ""All of these things required us to spend money that we had not originally planned to spend, or weren't originally part of the budget,"" Cheney said. ""Stuff happens. And the administration has to be able to respond to that, and we did."" Obama has begun to wind down the war in Iraq, which has cost more than 4,200 American lives and nearly $700 billion in direct costs. But Cheney said the United States has ""accomplished nearly everything we set out to do"" in Iraq, including establishing a democratic government in the Middle East. Cheney was one of the administration's leading advocates of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, pressing the Bush administration's argument that Iraq was concealing weapons of mass destruction and could provide those weapons to terrorists. None of those weapons were found after the invasion, but Cheney said, ""We've eliminated that possibility."" In 2005, Cheney said the raging insurgency against U.S. troops was in its ""last throes."" Nearly two years later, a commitment of more than 30,000 additional American troops and a widespread effort to pay former insurgents to turn against Islamic militants helped quell the worst of the violence. ""I don't hear much talk about that, but the fact is, the violence level is down 90 percent,"" Cheney said. ""The number of casualties [among] Iraqis and Americans is significantly diminished. There's been elections, a constitution. They're about to have another presidential election here in the near future. We have succeeded in creating in the heart of the Middle East a democratically governed Iraq, and that is a big deal, and it is, in fact, what we set out to do."" But Sestak said the administration was too slow to react to the problems it faced in Iraq and let the conflict overshadow the ""whole fabric"" of U.S. national security. ""The cost of this war is something that I strongly believe has far, far hurt us,"" he said. ""We're going to recover, because we're Americans. But Iraq was just one piece of our security, and this administration failed to realize that."" Though considered one of the administration's most influential figures, Cheney said President Bush rebuffed his advice on at least two issues.  Watch Cheney tout Bush administration » . He said Bush left former Cheney aide Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby ""sort of hanging in the wind"" by refusing to issue Libby a pardon before leaving office. Libby was convicted of perjury, obstruction of justice, and lying to federal agents investigating the leak of a former CIA officer's identity. ""I believe firmly that Scooter was unjustly accused and prosecuted and deserved a pardon, and the president disagreed with that,"" Cheney said. He would disclose no details of his efforts to lobby the president on Libby's behalf, saying they would be ""best left to history."" And Cheney said he argued against the administration's policy on North Korea, which tested a nuclear weapon in 2006. The Bush administration reached a still-incomplete disarmament deal with the isolated Stalinist state in 2007 and removed it from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism as part of the deal. ""I had my say,"" Cheney told CNN. ""I got my chance to voice my views and my objections. I didn't think the North Koreans were going to keep their end of the bargain in terms of what they agreed to, and they didn't."" The Obama administration has nominated Christopher Hill, the State Department official who was the top U.S. negotiator with North Korea, to be the U.S. ambassador to Iraq. Cheney said Hill lacks the Middle East experience that his predecessors have, and ""I did not support the work that Chris Hill did with respect to North Korea."" ""I think it's a choice that I wouldn't have made,"" he said.","NEW: Cheney: Harsh interrogations, warrantless eavesdropping ""essential""

"(CNN) -- The United States shares the blame for Mexican drug trafficking and the attendant violence that has killed thousands in the past year alone, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is in Mexico for a series of meetings on the drug crisis and other issues. ""Our insatiable demand for illegal drugs fuels the drug trade,"" she said en route to Mexico City, Mexico, according to pool reports. ""Our inability to prevent weapons from being illegally smuggled across the border to arm these criminals causes the deaths of police officers, soldiers and civilians. So, yes, I feel very strongly we have a co-responsibility."" Clinton will meet with President Felipe Calderon and other Mexican leaders to discuss bilateral strategies for the drug war. But her aides said she will also make an effort to show that the U.S.-Mexican relationship is not restricted to matters related to drug violence. As Clinton arrived in the Mexican capital Wednesday, a day after the United States unveiled its plan to improve security along the southern border, the United States' investment in the drug war emerged as a predominant theme.  Watch Clinton acknowledge the U.S. role in Mexico's drug war » . She emphasized that the United States has already appropriated $700 million in aid to Mexico, and Congress wants to see how the administration is applying it before sending more. ""We are going to demonstrate that we are spending it in an accountable and effective manner that will assist the Mexicans"" in law enforcement and justice, she said. The United States needs to stop the flow of guns, body armor and night-vision goggles to the cartels, Clinton said. ""When you go into a gunfight or are trying to round up these bad guys and they have military-style equipment that is much better than yours, you start out at a disadvantage. Since we know the vast majority of that comes from our country, we are going to help stop it from getting there in the first place."" Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico's ambassador to the United States, called the Obama administration's willingness to accept co-responsibility ""a very encouraging sign.""  Watch Sarukhan share his thoughts on the U.S. move » . ""I think that the fact that the Obama administration is seized with the importance of this issue is a clear indication that they understand that, to defang the drug syndicates in Mexico, we have to eliminate two of their most powerful sources -- bulk cash from the United States into Mexico and illicit weapons."" In most instances, local and state police ""are outgunned by the drug syndicates,"" which has necessitated the use of federal forces, he said. The Mexican army arrested a man Mexico calls a top drug cartel chief and four of his bodyguards, the government announced Wednesday. Hector Huerta Rios, also known as ""La Burra"" or ""El Junior,"" was arrested Tuesday in the city of San Pedro Garza Garcia, outside Monterrey in Nuevo Leon state, a little more than 100 miles from Mexico's border with the United States. The Obama administration announced a crackdown on border violence and on the smuggling of cash and weapons into Mexico on Tuesday, a step that could mark an end to a nasty blame game over where responsibility for the violence lies. Clinton called the fighting ""a terrible law-enforcement problem"" in U.S. cities along the Mexican border, but said it does not yet pose a major threat to overall U.S. security. ""This is more about trying to act proactively,"" she said in an interview with CNN's Jill Dougherty in Mexico City. ""We need to help them, or we'll see the results in our own country. ""[Traffickers] are distributing these drugs in our country. They're causing all kinds of criminal activity in our country. It has an effect on us, so we want to prevent it from going any further."" Clinton will visit a Mexican police base to show U.S. support for the nation's embattled police force. And she will travel to Monterrey, a thriving industrial town, to meet with students, hold a town-hall meeting with business leaders and visit a clean energy plant. The Defense Department and the director of national intelligence have both warned of the national security threat an unstable Mexico poses to the United States. Congress has seized on the issue, holding eight hearings since coming back into session two months ago. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano testified at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on violence along the U.S.-Mexican border Wednesday. Mexico is the United States' second-largest export market, after Canada, and its third-largest total trade partner. Hundreds of U.S. companies have factories in Mexico, and Mexico is a leading supplier of crude oil to the United States. Clinton noted many Americans have close ties and families in Mexico, adding she honeymooned there. Napolitano and Attorney General Eric Holder are due to visit Mexico soon, to be followed next month by President Obama, before he attends the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago.","NEW: Clinton says fighting does not pose major threat to U.S. security -- yet .

Then, he called the police to taunt them. Police in Largo, Florida, a city near Tampa on the state's gulf coast, circulated security pictures of ""Plasma Pat,"" and now can put a name to the alliterative nickname.

Police believe ""Plasma Pat"" has conned victims in about a dozen different places in Florida. He allegedly befriended people outside Wal-Mart stores, telling his victims that he worked at the store, and that he could use his employee discount to get them a good deal on a major purchase. Then, police said, he took their cash, walked into the store through one door -- and out another, leaving his victims in the parking lot. One victim found himself out $300 while waiting outside for a television. Largo Police say that Torma also called them several times. asking to speak with Det. Brendan Arlington. Each time he called, police say, Torma identified himself as ""Plasma Pat,"" and bragged that he had cheated about 30,000 people who will never file a police report. ""Because the victims feel embarrassed, he feels that nobody is going to report the crime,"" said Lt. Michael Loux. ""And I think he's probably right.""

"EL PASO, Texas (CNN) -- The cell phone rang as Jorge Aguirre walked to a friend's funeral in Juarez, Mexico, last November -- a funeral for a fellow journalist who, Aguirre says, was assassinated for the critical stories he wrote. Mexican federal police recently began patrolling Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. When he answered the phone, Aguirre heard a profanity-laced threat. ""They told me I was next,"" Aguirre told CNN. ""I thought they were going to kill me right there."" Aguirre immediately gathered up his family and darted across the border into El Paso, Texas. He hasn't returned to Juarez since that day. Aguirre is seeking asylum in the United States, and he's part of a growing trend among Mexican citizens looking to escape the violence and corruption of their homeland.  Watch journalists met with death threats » . According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency that falls under the Department of Homeland Security, the number of Mexican nationals requesting asylum in the United States based on ""credible fear"" has gone up every year since 2003, even as the overall number of ""credible fear"" asylum cases remains steady. In 2003, the USCIS reported 54 asylum cases from Mexican citizens. In 2008, that number reached 312. But asylum requests based on fear of violence aren't easy cases to make. Last year, the United States approved less than half of those cases. ""Whether they're fleeing extortionists or potential kidnappers or they're leaving because of the drug cartels, it tells you there are definitely problems in Mexico right now,"" said El Paso Mayor John Cook. Those seeking asylum come from every walk of life. There are journalists, entrepreneurs and even law enforcement officials, including three police chiefs. For Raymond Cobos, the sheriff in Luna County, New Mexico, this is the most disturbing revelation. Just across the Mexican border is a dusty, far-flung outpost called Palomas, a speck of a town that's a popular path for drug trafficking and human smuggling. It's also been the site of wild gunbattles between cops and the cartels. The cartels outgunned the police force, and the police chief disappeared and sought asylum in the United States. It's not clear where his case stands or where the police chief is today. ""I don't know what I would do. It's pretty hard to fight that type of situation by yourself -- if you're in an environment that you don't know from one day to the next if someone's going to knock on your door and blast your family away,"" Cobos said. Emilio Gutierrez is another journalist hiding in El Paso.

"(CNN)  -- More than 2,000 students in Southern California laid 65 miles of pennies on a speedway track Thursday in an attempt to set a world record and help schools in the area. Mason Gonzalez is ready with pennies. Dodgers tickets were prizes for collecting the most pennies. THINK (Teaching, Helping, Inspiring & Nurturing Kids) Together didn't meet its original goal of laying out 100 miles of pennies at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, California, but group spokeswoman Nadia Flores said the group is happy with the results. ""We raised twice what we were able to lay down,"" she said. ""I think the energy and the vibe from having so many kids and volunteers present made it really fun."" Flores said the group ran out of time in its attempt to get all 100 miles laid out, but she added that they're confident they have the record anyway. Guinness World Records, which would certify the record, said Thursday it had not yet received documentation from the group. The current record for pennies laid out is 40 miles. The money -- about $84,500 -- will go to the nonprofit program that provides free after-school care for students at more than 200 elementary and middle schools in at-risk communities in four California counties -- Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino. Flores said the idea for ""Miles of Change"" came after group members saw students at a school in Kansas make a 40-mile chain of pennies in July 2008 to set the world record. Flores said her group, based in Santa Ana, California, wanted a program that would unite the counties involved -- and set a record. The pennies were collected by 35,000 students in the after-school program and were laid in loops around the two-mile track in Fontana, California. Flores said every penny must be touching the next penny in order to qualify for the Guinness world record. Documentation will include aerial photos, she said. Each student took home tubes to collect the pennies. Students who collected the most got tickets to future Los Angeles Dodgers games, Flores said. The effort also is meant to honor Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday and the 100th anniversary of the introduction of the Lincoln penny.","Southern California students want to break 40-mile world record set in Kansas .

"(CNN) -- Organs donated by a slain Oakland, California, police officer saved four lives, and his donated tissue will enhance the lives of up to 50 others, the California Transplant Donor Network said Wednesday. Officer John Hege was one of four police officers fatally shot Saturday in Oakland, California. Officer John Hege, 41, was pronounced brain dead on Sunday but was kept on life support pending a decision on organ donation. He was the fourth Oakland officer to die after a gunman fired on police in two weekend incidents. ""Officer Hege was registered on the Donate Life California Organ and Tissue Registry, which his family also supports,"" the donor network said in a news release. ""He chose in death as he did in life to help those in need. His organ donations saved the lives of four adult males from California."" Hege's liver, kidneys and heart were donated, the network said, and the transplants were successfully completed Tuesday and early Wednesday. In a written statement, Hege's family said, ""Our son John never met a stranger."" ""John's courage and strength was enhanced by his ability to perceive the realities of life,"" the family said in the statement. ""In June 2008, he registered on the Donate Life California Organ and Tissue Donor Registry. We completely and proudly support his decision, and it gives us a great deal of comfort to know that four individuals have received the gift of life because of our selfless and beloved John. ""Even in death he gave to the lives of those in our community whom he had always loved and supported."" Hege had been with the Oakland police force about 10 years. The man accused of shooting the officers -- Lovelle Mixon, 26, of Oakland -- was fatally shot in a gun battle with SWAT officers in an apartment complex where he was hiding, police said. Authorities said Saturday night that Mixon had an extensive criminal history and was in violation of parole for assault with a deadly weapon. The incidents began about 1 p.m. Saturday in east Oakland, when two motorcycle officers tried to pull over a car for a ""fairly routine traffic stop,"" said Dave Kozicki, deputy police chief. Emergency dispatchers received reports that two officers had been shot and needed help, he said. Those officers were Hege and Sgt. Mark Dunakin, 40, an 18-year veteran of the force. Dunakin died Saturday. Police launched an intense manhunt to track down the gunman. An anonymous caller directed authorities to a building on an adjacent street where the man was believed to be barricaded, acting Police Chief Howard Jordan said. The gunman fired on SWAT officers who entered the apartment, hitting two of them before police shot and killed the man, Jordan said. Those two officers -- Sgt. Ervin Romans, 43, and Sgt. Daniel Sakai, 35 -- died. Police said Romans had been with the department since 1996 and Sakai since 2000. A fifth officer who was grazed by a bullet was treated at a hospital and released, police spokesman Jeff Thomason said Saturday.","John Hege, three other Oakland police officers fatally wounded over weekend .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Navy submarine and a Navy amphibious ship that collided Friday in the Strait of Hormuz south of Iran have arrived in Bahrain to be assessed for damage, the Navy said. The submarine USS Hartford and amphibious ship USS New Orleans are shown in Navy photos. The submarine USS Hartford and amphibious ship USS New Orleans arrived Saturday in Mina Salman pier to ""to further assess and evaluate the damage that resulted from their collision at sea,"" the service said in a written statement. Fifteen sailors were slightly hurt aboard the Hartford in the collision, which occurred early Friday morning. On Friday, Navy officials in Washington told CNN that there was significant damage to the sail, or tower-like structure on the topside of the submarine. On Saturday, the Navy said there was no damage to the submarine's propulsion unit. No injuries were reported aboard the New Orleans. The ship's fuel tank ruptured, spilling 25,000 gallons of marine diesel fuel in the Strait of Hormuz, the U.S. Navy said in the Saturday statement. ""Aerial searches of the area where the fuel spill occurred were conducted yesterday, and revealed no indication of any remaining fuel on the ocean's surface,"" the Navy said. ""The quick dissipation of the fuel is likely due to the type of fuel, and various environmental factors to include air and water temperatures, winds and seas."" When the collision occurred, both vessels were headed to ports in the Persian Gulf to stock up on provisions and allow for some recreation, Navy spokesman Lt. Nate Christensen said Friday. Christensen said there were about 200 sailors in the sub and 1,000 sailors and Marines aboard the ship. The Strait of Hormuz is located between the United Arab Emirates and Iran, linking the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. It is heavily used by oil tankers. Both vessels are on regularly scheduled deployments to the U.S. Navy Central Command area of responsibility, and conduct Maritime Security Operations.","Vessels in Bahrain ""to further assess and evaluate the damage,"" says Navy .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An Air Force F-22A fighter jet crashed Wednesday near Edwards Air Force Base in California, killing the test pilot, the Air Force said. An F-22A fighter jet similar to this one crashed Wednesday during a test mission in California. The single-seater crashed about 10:30 a.m. (1:30 p.m. ET) for unknown reasons, Air Force officials said. Lockheed Martin said the test pilot, David Cooley, 49, of Palmdale, California, joined the company in 2003 and was a 21-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force. The fighter was on a test mission when it crashed about 35 miles northeast of  Edwards AFB, where it was stationed, the Air Force said in a news release. At $150 million apiece, the F-22A is the most expensive Air Force fighter. In 2004, an F-22 Raptor crashed on a training mission in the Nevada desert. The pilot ejected and was not hurt, though the jet was destroyed. The plane was designed in the 1980s to provide a stealthy method to enter Soviet air space and strike Soviet bombers if the USSR attempted a nuclear strike. Once the Cold War ended, the Air Force found a new mission for the F-22 as a long-range fighter with a sophisticated stealth design and state-of-the-art equipment that no other plane could rival. However, the rising cost of the plane and numerous design and software problems threatened the program, which was almost eliminated by Congress. In the end, the aircraft survived, and most of the problems were fixed -- except for the price tag, which forced the Air Force to buy fewer aircraft.","NEW: Test pilot David Cooley, 49, of Palmdale, California, dies in crash .

"FARGO, North Dakota (CNN)  -- Forecasters issued flash flood warnings for Bismarck and surrounding areas Wednesday, as volunteers rushed to fill sandbags ahead of expected record floods in the flat state of North Dakota. Explosives are set off in the Missouri River on Wednesday to break up ice jams. Areas of three counties -- Morton, Emmons and Burleigh, which includes the North Dakota capital of Bismarck -- were under a flash flood warning until 12:30 p.m. CT (1:30 p.m. ET), the National Weather Service said. In an effort to alleviate the flooding, demolition crews blew up an ice jam Wednesday evening south of  Bismarck, according to CNN affiliate KXMB. Mayor John Warford said that water appeared to be moving more freely in the Missouri River after the explosives were set off, KXMB reported. The plan is make sure water continues flow through the river channel and not spread out over land. Ice jams in rivers have been a major factor in the flooding there. Most of the state, which endured a particularly harsh winter, remained under a flood warning Wednesday, with forecasters predicting possibly record flood levels on several rivers. Snow, which continued to fall Wednesday, complicated preparations, city officials said. ""I woke up this morning and looked outside, I guess I thought of the same thing everybody else did. ... [What] came to mind is what a revolting development this is,"" said Mark Voxland, the mayor of Moorhead, Minnesota, a city just outside of Fargo.  Watch flooded fields of snow » . More than 1,000 people were evacuated from an area near Bismarck on Tuesday night as the Missouri River flooded, Rick Robinson of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services said Wednesday.  See a map of the affected area » . Emergency officials said they were particularly concerned about the Red River, which snakes through eastern portions of North and South Dakota and western Minnesota. The river is expected to crest between 39 and 41 feet in Fargo on Friday, according to Cecily Fong of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. The record for the Red River at Fargo was set in 1897 at 40.1 feet, according to Pat Slattery of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The threat of flooding prompted authorities to ask for volunteers to fill sandbags either to build temporary dikes or to bolster existing ones. In some areas, even at 3:30 a.m., hundreds of volunteers packed into individual sandbagging centers, an organizer said.  See images of flooding, preparation » . ""There have been so many volunteers that we had to turn people away,"" said Ryan McEwan, a supervisor at one volunteer coordinating center. ""It is very busy. They are filling sandbags as fast as they can."" As of late Tuesday, Fargo residents and out-of-town volunteers had filled more than 1 million sandbags out of the needed 2 million. Fargo Deputy Mayor Tim Mahoney said he hoped that goal would be met by Thursday. Fargo's mayor, Dennis Walaker, said Wednesday that his city was about 95 percent prepared for the flooding, which is expected later in the week. ""I went and looked at the dikes this morning, and they're significant, absolutely significant,"" he said in a briefing Wednesday morning. However, he said, ""We have some areas we need to shore up."" Just south of Fargo, authorities said they had rescued several people in Oxbow, a town of about 238 people, after a residential dike gave way. In some places, water had reached halfway up residents' basement stairs, and in others, it had reached the main level of homes, Sgt. Gail Wichmann said.

"(CNN) -- Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano unveiled a $700 million plan on Tuesday to help Mexico fight violent drug cartels, which includes a U.S. crackdown on the flow of weapons and money into Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says the DHS plan will address demand and border security. The move sets the stage for visits to Mexico by three administration Cabinet members, starting tomorrow with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in an effort to stem drug-related violence and prevent it from spilling into the United States. CNN's Kyra Phillips spoke with Napolitano on Tuesday about the United States' involvement in the Mexican government's war against drug cartels and the United States' stake in the conflict. Kyra Phillips: Well, I want to get right to it because we'll never be able to defeat the drug lords until our own demand for drugs here in the U.S. is curbed. I mean, it is our consumption in the U.S. that fuels the drug lord production. So, what are you going to do to decrease that demand? Janet Napolitano: Well, the whole package we announced today is not only about enforcement and stopping the flow of drugs into the United States and helping Mexico against these very brutal cartels, but it includes money for more drug courts and reduction in demand. So, we look forward to working on the demand side as well as the supply side, but I'll tell you, where the Department of Homeland Security is concerned, it's all about border safety and security and making sure that spillover violence does not erupt in our own country. Phillips: We're talking about more than 200 cities, cities that we'd never think of, like Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and Sioux Falls [South Dakota]. I mean, what about the people right now that are dealing with sexual abuse, murder, house invasions, kidnapping? Napolitano: That's right. What is happening, for those who don't live on the border, is that there are some large drug cartels. They're old. They've been in Mexico for a long time, but they've gotten larger and more powerful. The president of Mexico has said, enough. And he is really going after those cartels. We've been clamping down on the land border, so the cartels simultaneously are fighting each other over ever-diminishing turf and they're fighting the federal government of Mexico. And that's what's caused 6,000 homicides in Mexico -- northern Mexico last year -- 550 of which were law enforcement or public officials who were assassinated by the cartels. But the cartels got so big and powerful because they were bringing tonnage loads of cocaine and other illegal drugs into our country, and their organizations ultimately went to supply those who are using illegal drugs in places like Sheboygan and places -- other places where you wouldn't think of having any connection with these big cartels. Their fingers were everywhere. We want to shut those cartels down. Phillips: Well, there are a lot of leaders here in the United States that say it's been -- we've helped those cartels. We've actually helped fuel the problem. And if you look at [Sen.] Dick Durbin [D-Illinois], chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, he said the drugs are coming north, and we're sending money and guns south. And as a result, these cartels have gained extraordinary power. And he also added, about 90 percent of guns seized in Mexican raids are traced back to the United States, About 2,000 firearms cross the border into Mexico daily. Napolitano: Well, it's a significant number of the guns used in this wave of violence in northern Mexico absolutely come from the United States. That's why part of our plan is increasing the number of agents who are going to inspect southbound vehicles. That's why we're sending technology to the border that will allow us to scan or do noninvasive X-rays to see whether cars are carrying assault weapons, other kinds of weapons that are now flowing into Mexico to fuel these drug cartels. And to find these huge truckloads, basically, of cash that are garnered in the United States and sent to Mexico. This is a strategy that we are -- have used in certain places. Now we're employing it border wide. Phillips: So, Madam Secretary, let me ask you about the military. For example, we've covered the city of Juarez, Mexico. You know how bad of a place that has been. Brutal murders, sexual abuse against women, people being beheaded, kidnapped. I mean, just ruthless cartel activity. And what did Mexico do? They took 5,000 military troops, 1,200 federal police officers and just about bombarded Juarez. And so, now they've seen a drop in these drug-related killings. It's sort of like what we saw in Iraq, you know, putting in troop surges into certain areas, and you saw a drop in violence. Would you ever consider doing something like that, getting the military involved and saying, OK, we can't take this anymore, we've got to do something drastic or it won't work? Napolitano: Well, obviously, the violence problem in Juarez was of a different quality and kind than anything we've seen in the United States. And it really did demand that kind of response by the federal government in Mexico. We have contingency plans on the United States side. And we're still evaluating a request that we do send some National Guard to some of the border areas. We're still looking at that. But you know, that clampdown in Mexico, in Juarez in particular, was really called for. The homicide situation there was out of control. Phillips: Let's talk about Gil Kerlikowske, the former Seattle [Washington] police chief. [President] Obama has selected him to be the drug czar for all of you. He hasn't been confirmed yet. But what does he know about dealing with cartels who have mastered kidnapping and beheadings and are using grenades and other forms of firepower, quite frankly, that is far greater than a lot of police forces we have in the U.S.? Napolitano: Well, he's a police chief, and police chiefs know a lot about a lot of different things. And as you yourself pointed out, these drug cartels have fingers that reach all over the United States, including into communities like Seattle. So, he'll come into that job, assuming he's confirmed, with a knowledge base, and also a knowledge base about what the use of illegal drugs is doing to people, does to families, does to our neighborhoods, our communities. That's why we need to work on the demand side as well as the supply side through these cartels. Phillips: Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, we'll definitely follow your efforts. Appreciate your time. Napolitano: Thank you so much.","Strategy aimed at preventing spillover violence, says chief of Homeland Security .

"(CNN) -- Nadya Suleman, the Southern California woman who gave birth to octuplets in January, has fired a nonprofit group of nurses charged with helping care for her children, CNN affiliate KTLA has reported. Nadya Suleman, mother of octuplets and six other children, fired a free nursing team, says a CNN affiliate. Suleman accused the nurses, from a group called Angels in Waiting, of spying on her to report her to child-welfare authorities, the affiliate reported Monday. The group was working for free, the affiliate said. Suleman instead will rely on nurses whom she is paying, Suleman's attorney said. She now has four of the octuplets at home, along with her six other children. The other octuplets remain in a hospital, which is discharging them two at a time to ease the adjustment. Suleman -- already a single mother with six young children -- gave birth to the octuplets through in-vitro fertilization, fueling controversy. News of her collecting public assistance for some of her children also outraged many taxpayers. She has not identified the father of the children, but spoke about him in a new video released on RadarOnline.com.  Watch Suleman describe donor » .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Melting glaciers in the Alps may prompt Italy and Switzerland to redraw their borders near the Matterhorn, according to parliamentary draft legislation being readied in Rome. Glaciers in the Alps near the Matterhorn are receding, forcing the border to be redrawn. Franco Narducci of Italy's opposition Democratic Party is preparing a bill to redefine the frontier with neighboring Switzerland, his office said Wednesday. Narducci is a member of the foreign affairs panel in Italy's lower Chamber of Deputies. Foreign Minister Franco Frattini has authorized the bill. Switzerland also has cooperated with Italy on the matter. The Italian Military Geographic Institute says climate change is responsible for the Alpine glaciers melting. ""This draft law is born out the necessity to revise and verify the frontiers given the changes in climate and atmosphere,"" Narducci said. ""The 1941 convention between Italy and Switzerland established as criteria [for border revisions] the ridge [crest] of the glaciers. Following the withdrawal of the glaciers in the Alps, a new criterion has been proposed so that the new border coincides with the rock."" The border change only affects uninhabited mountaintop terrain. The deputy excludes the possibility of any family having to change citizenship. The border between Italy and Switzerland was fixed 1861, when Italy became a nation, but it has been occasionally modified, the Military Geographic Institute said. The border was last modified in the 1970s when the Switzerland-Italy highway was built at the Brogeda crossing. The bill is expected to become law by the end of April, Narducci said. Unlike Switzerland, Italy can change its border only with new laws approved by parliament. Narducci said the same negotiation will be proposed to France and Austria . ""Once upon a time, the border line demarcation between two nations was synonymous to war and bloodshed,"" he said. ""Instead , today we proceed with photograms.""","Melting glaciers in Alps forcing Italy and Switzerland to redraw their borders .

"(CNN) -- A firefighter in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, was arrested Monday in connection with two recent arson incidents, authorities said. Coatesville has recorded more than 20 arson cases in 2009. Robert Tracey is held in two of the fires. Robert Tracey, 37, was taken into custody Monday afternoon for allegedly setting two fires Friday night, Chester County District Attorney Joe Carroll said. Coatesville has been hit by a string of arsons in recent months and although the arson task force investigating those cases made Monday's arrest, officials did not link the arrest to any other arson cases. The criminal complaint against Tracey lists nine charges stemming from a fire set to a homeowner's porch swing and a fire set in another homeowner's trash can. The fires, both Friday night, were extinguished before any serious damage was done, authorities said. No injuries were reported. Carroll said eyewitness accounts, including descriptions of the suspect's clothes, helped lead to the arrest. Carroll said the arrest of a firefighter was ""extremely troubling."" He said the arson task force is working diligently to solve the arson cases and that ""there is no more important investigation"" to his office. On January 23, Tracey, who was then an assistant chief of volunteer firefighters in Coatesville, told CNN affiliate WPVI that fighting multiple fires was ""really taxing the fire department."" Tracey recently became a paid firefighter with the department, according to Carroll. Tracey was jailed with bond set at $2 million, Carroll said. He is expected to be arraigned March 30, according to Carroll. Tracey is the third person arrested this year in connection with arsons in Coatesville, which has recorded more than 20 arson cases so far in 2009.","Robert Tracey, 37, arrested for allegedly setting two fires Friday night .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Imagine the Batmobile busting bad guys in Bismarck, North Dakota, or ""Knight Rider's"" KITT corralling criminals on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Carbon Motors Corp.'s E7 concept vehicle was on display recently near the U.S. Capitol. Carbon Motors Corp.'s new high-tech cop car prototype might not be quite up to superhero specs, but some police say it could be a welcome addition to their arsenal. ""I don't see any downside to this car,"" said Carl Latorre, a Pennsylvania State Police dispatcher who served 35 years as a Philadelphia police officer. ""I am so excited about this car. This car rates up there with cops carrying automatic weapons to combat what the criminals carry now. It's about time that something like this came about."" OK, so it doesn't have a nanotech cloaking capability or rocket boosters, but every feature on the Carbon E7 concept vehicle draws on suggestions from more than 3,000 law enforcement professionals. The result is a futuristic prowler with a 300-horsepower clean diesel engine, flashing lights visible from all angles, an ergonomic cockpit, an onboard computer with voice command and instant license plate recognition, integrated shotgun mounts, and more. (Weapons of mass destruction detectors are available as an option -- seriously.)  See how the E7 stacks up against KITT and the Dark Knight's Tumbler » . The E7 was designed by cops for cops, breaking the tradition of recruiting family sedans into the force, company co-founder Stacy Dean Stephens said. ""The current vehicles that they (police departments) use were designed for driving around, going to the grocery store, taking kids to school -- things like that,"" Stephens said. ""You don't have an engineer sitting at one of the other automakers who says, 'Y'know, I think what we need to do is we need to take this car, and we need to run into a curb at 50 miles an hour and see how many times it takes before the wheels and the suspension fails on it."" The rear passenger compartment alone is enough to make experienced cops get teary-eyed. The rear-hinged ""suicide doors"" make it easier for handcuffed passengers to get in and out, and the seat is designed so ""guests"" can ride comfortably with their hands cuffed behind their backs. For officer safety, Latorre likes how the seat belts are anchored in the center of the seat and buckle near the door so the officer doesn't have to lean across the prisoner. ""When you put a prisoner in the back seat, you're supposed to strap him in,"" Latorre said. ""Nowadays, you have to make sure your gun isn't going close to his hands, and how are you going to strap somebody in doing that?"" Perhaps most popular among cops is the rear compartment, which is sealed off from the front and made entirely of seamless, washable plastic, with drain plugs in the floor. ""Numerous times I've had less than pleasant experience"" with prisoners vomiting or relieving themselves in the back seat, said Stephens, a former Texas police officer. The seat innovations are up front, too, where the seats have recesses to accommodate officers' bulky gun belts. ""The front seat -- I couldn't believe the front seat. They thought of everything,"" Latorre said. ""You don't know how difficult it is to get out of a car. The first thing you've got to do is adjust your gun belt. The gun belt shouldn't be a problem."" The E7 can go 0 to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds, has a top speed of 155 mph and can withstand a 75-mph rear impact, according to the company's Web site. It has bullet-resistant panels in the doors and dash and has push bumpers incorporated into the aluminum frame. The upper flashing lights are integrated into the roof panel, eliminating the need for a bolted-on light bar that causes aerodynamic drag -- reducing fuel economy -- and can lead to rust.  Watch police check out the car and hear the engine growl » . Despite the technological ""wow"" factor and officer enthusiasm, the E7 could prove to be a tough sell. ""The people are very intelligent and smart that are setting this up,"" said Lt. Michael Arnold, fleet manager of the Bismarck, North Dakota, police department. ""What scares me is they don't give you a price."" Company officials say the price -- possibly around $50,000 per unit -- will be ""competitive"" considering the cost of equipping a conventional car for police work and how long each vehicle lasts. The Carbon E7 will be built to last 250,000 miles, compared with 75,000 to 120,000 miles for the typical patrol car, Stephens said. ""When it's all said and done it's a matter of how much it costs per mile,"" said Bismarck Deputy Chief Fred Wooten. Regardless of how good it looks on paper, a state or big-city agency won't be willing to take a chance on a vehicle with no track record, said Detective Mary Wheat, spokesperson for the Portland, Oregon, police department. ""If they do cost $50,000, nobody's going to buy them,"" Wheat said. ""Nobody's going to buy them. No, police agencies can't afford $50,000 cars. We have huge fleets of cars. We have hundreds of them; hundreds and hundreds of cars. And we turn them over. I mean, we ride them hard. Those cars are used on a 24-hour basis. That wouldn't work."" But municipalities don't balk at paying large sums for other purpose-built vehicles such as firetrucks and ambulances, countered Latorre, the Pennsylvania officer. ""They don't say, 'Oh, here's a box truck; go fight fires with it' or 'Here's an E-250 cargo van; go pick up patients with it,' do they?,"" he said. ""So I don't see why the municipality wouldn't say, 'You know what? This [police car] is nothing but a plus for us.'"" The company, based in Atlanta, Georgia, doesn't yet have a factory, but has named five states where it could locate: Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina and South Carolina. Production is scheduled to begin in 2012, Stephens said. Carbon doesn't expect to take over the market quickly, instead counting on a few ""early adopters"" willing to take a risk on a few vehicles and work out the kinks to everyone else's satisfaction, Stephens said. Hundreds of agencies already have made online reservations for thousands of Carbon Motors vehicles, putting the company ""very well on our way to selling out our first year,"" he said. Wheat praised the Carbon team's entrepreneurship and suggested the company market its car first in smaller towns with less red tape and simpler bidding processes. That works for Wooten, the deputy chief in Bismarck. ""We'll be more than happy to field test one,"" he offered. ""If it works as advertised, we'll probably have a fleet of them someday.""","Carbon Motors' E7 prototype is not your father's Crown Victoria .

"(CNN) --   Connie and Donald McCracken were watching CNN one evening last week when they learned of the tragic death of actress Natasha Richardson from a head injury. Immediately, their minds turned to their 7-year-old daughter, Morgan, who was upstairs getting ready for bed. An injured Morgan McCracken has benefited from awareness after Natasha Richardson's death. Two days earlier, Morgan, her father, and brother had been playing baseball in the yard of their Mentor, Ohio, home when her father hit a line drive that landed just above Morgan's left temple. A lump formed, but the McCrackens iced it down and the swelling subsided within an hour. ""For the next two days, she was perfectly fine,"" Donald McCracken says. ""She had no symptoms. She went to school both days and got an A on her spelling test as usual. There were no issues whatsoever."" But after hearing about Richardson's death, the McCrackens wondered if Morgan was really as OK as she seemed. After all, Richardson had been talking and lucid immediately after her fatal injury. When they went upstairs to kiss Morgan good night, she complained of a headache. ""Because of Natasha, we called the pediatrician immediately. And by the time I got off the phone with him, Morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much,"" McCracken says. The McCrackens took Morgan to the emergency room at LakeWest Hospital in neighboring Willoughby, where doctors ordered a CT scan and immediately put Morgan on a helicopter to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, with her father by her side. ""I knew it was bad when she had to get there by helicopter in six minutes, instead of the 30 minutes it would have taken to get to Cleveland in an ambulance,"" McCracken said. When the helicopter arrived at Rainbow, the McCrackens were greeted by Dr. Alan Cohen, the hospital's chief of pediatric neurosurgery. He whisked Morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson: an epidural hematoma. McCracken remembers standing in the emergency room, feeling like the life had just been sucked out of him. ""My heart sank,"" he says. ""It just sank."" Unlike Richardson's, Morgan's story has a happy ending. After surgery and five days in the hospital, she's at home and doing fine. ""Dr. Cohen told us that if we hadn't brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up,"" McCracken says. Now the McCrackens sometimes wonder if they waited too long to get Morgan to a doctor. After hearing about Richardson's death, many people are asking themselves the same question: Do all head injuries need attention, even ones that seem minor? ""Sometimes there's a gray zone, and there's no right answer,"" Cohen says.  Watch for tips on when to go to the ER » . In most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist. ""They're confused, they're agitated, or they might be dizzy or unresponsive,"" he says. But then there's what doctors call the ""talk and die"" scenario, where someone seems fine, only to die hours, or sometimes even days later. ""Talk and die"" can happen with several different kinds of brain injuries. In the case of epidural hematomas, the injury Richardson and Morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull. ""Fluid is building up in a contained space, creating pressure. Something's got to give, and that something is the brain,"" Ayotte says. If you don't get to the hospital to have surgery to drain the fluid, ""the deterioration can happen very quickly."" Here, from Ayotte and other experts, is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury. 1. Be vigilant . Keep an eye on someone who has hit his head, even if the person never lost consciousness. ""A lot of folks are still under the assumption that as long as you're not knocked out, you're OK, and that's not true,"" Ayotte says. 2. Look for dizziness, vomiting, headache and confusion . If the injured person has these signs, take him or her to an emergency room, says Dr. Jam Ghajar, clinical professor of neurological surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, and president of the Brain Trauma Foundation. 3. Look for changes in symptoms and behavior . Any sudden change, such as Morgan's headache going from mild to severe in minutes, means the person needs medical attention. For example, Ghajar says, if a person gets suddenly sleepy in the first 12 hours after a hit, it may mean the parts of the brain responsible for staying awake are experiencing pressure from a bleed. 4. Be especially wary if someone a) has been drinking alcohol, b) is on blood thinners, c) is elderly or d) is a young athlete . It's tough to distinguish brain-injured behavior from drunken behavior, so when in doubt, take the person to the hospital, Ghajar says. Also, blood thinners can turn a mild bleed into a major bleed, so be especially vigilant if the injured person is taking blood thinners such as warfarin. He also warns people to be extra vigilant when an elderly person hits his or her head. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has information on traumatic brain injury and senior citizens. The CDC also has information on concussions in young athletes. 5. Go to a certified trauma center if you can . The American College of Surgeons has a list of certified trauma facilities; a hospital that's not a trauma center may not have a neurosurgeon on call. You can also look on this map from the American Trauma Society. Find your state, select trauma centers, update the map, and you can find information about trauma centers in your area. The McCrackens say they look back and still can't believe Morgan suffered such a severe injury and didn't show any signs for 48 hours. ""She didn't black out, her speech wasn't slurred, she wasn't dizzy, she wasn't any of the things you'd expect,"" McCracken says. ""And you don't want to be one of those panicky parents who takes their child to the emergency room all the time."" Cohen's advice after a head injury: When in doubt, go. ""It's always better to err on the side of being conservative,"" he says. CNN Medical Producer Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.","Richardson's death raises question: When should you go to ER after head injury?

"In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. CNN's Gary Tuchman accompanied a Border Patrol unit in Nogales, Arizona, and experienced the variety and the danger of law enforcement life firsthand. CNN's Gary Tuchman pulls his weight on ride-along with 64 lbs. of marijuana seized by law enforcement. NOGALES, Arizona (CNN) -- Nogales, Arizona, is a small city. Just more than 20,000 people live here, according to the 2005 census. But spend a couple of days here with law enforcement, and your head will spin. Almost half of all illegal drugs seized from Mexico last year were seized in the eastern Arizona region, and Nogales is the largest border city in this U.S. border patrol sector. In the past six months, the Border Patrol has seized about 500,000 pounds of illegal drugs here, which is 15 percent higher than the previous six months. Each day, hundreds of people are arrested, mostly for immigration violations but many for drug and weapons crimes. The temporary jail cells in the Border Patrol station in Nogales are often overflowing. The Border Patrol boss in this sector says his agents were assaulted 260 times within the past year. One night this week, we saw the danger and variety of lawbreaking activity experienced here quite vividly. At the immigration checkpoint set up a half-hour north of Nogales on Interstate 19, a semi truck is pulled over when the drug-sniffing dog detects something. The back of the truck is opened, and inside are thousands of tomatoes, but the dog is still not happy. The truck is taken back to the Border Patrol station, and agents climb over the tomatoes. And that's where they find the stash. Bales and bales of dope. Forty bales of marijuana. Nine hundred eight pounds, to be exact. At a street value of $800 a pound, the authorities estimate they kept $720,000 worth of marijuana off the streets. I interview the man arrested for driving the shipment. The operating theory: that he is doing dirty work for one of the Mexican cartels. But the Mexican man tells me he is not scared, because ""I was just carrying tomatoes."" He claims that he knew nothing about the nearly half-ton of pot. The man will be telling that to the judge and could face significant time in an American prison. Illegal drugs consume the day of all law enforcement people here. We drive with the Border Patrol in the late hours of the night and hear a call over the radio that two men have been spotted jumping the border wall with backpacks. The chase is on, and another dog is brought to the area. The men disappear, but the dog picks up a scent in the heavy, hilly brush. Sarah the drug-sniffing dog is taught to sit when she finds something. She suddenly sits and then jumps on what looks like bushes. It turns out the bushes are actually attached to sacks of marijuana. Two 25-pound sacks full of pot. They were abandoned by the men when they ran away after being spotted. Street value, at least $40,000. Ray Rivera, the agent who works with Sarah, told me that over the past two years, Sarah has found nearly 7,000 pounds of pot. But Rivera also is pretty heroic. Just a couple of weeks ago, he was shot in the leg when a man he was chasing committed suicide. The bullet passed through the man's face and into Rivera's knee. Law enforcement life here is not for the squeamish. Before we leave this area, we go to a rural area west of Nogales where we hear illegal immigrants and drug couriers often try to get into the United States. When we get there, we see why. The tall border fence abruptly ends as it gets close to a small mountain, but there is plenty of space for people to squeeze into the United States. We wander about 10 feet into Mexico to look at some of the clothes, water bottles and cigarette boxes that people have left behind. As we get ready to leave, we see a Border Patrol vehicle zooming towards us. They don't know we're with CNN; they think we may be criminals. One of the four agents points his rifle at us and demands that we keep our hands in plain sight. They search our car, and we tell them who we are and what we're doing. They say they spotted us because of their long-range video cameras. They tell us to give them a heads up next time we go exploring, and all is well. The agents did their job well. But there are only so many of them and an immense amount of border. After spending time with these agents, it's easy to see how sometimes what they do feels like a thankless task.","About half of seizures of illegal drugs from Mexico occurred in eastern Arizona region .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- While automakers lay off staff and shut down plants in response to the economic downturn, one automaker announced Thursday that it will open a manufacturing plant in the United States, potentially creating hundreds of jobs in the area eventually chosen. Tesla unveils its Model S sedan, with a base price of $57,400. The manufacturing plant will be in California. Tesla Motors, maker of a high-end electric sports car, says it will build an all-electric sedan in Southern California. Thursday's announcement was made in Hawthorne, California, where Tesla unveiled the Model S sedan at a base price of $49,900, after a federal tax credit of $7,500. That's less than half the price of its first model, the Roadster. Started in 2003 and bankrolled by PayPal millionaire Elon Musk, Tesla has attracted investments from the Silicon Valley elite, among them Google founder Larry Page. It is widely believed that the Model S sedan will be built near the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation facility in Hawthorne. That aerospace company, more commonly known as SpaceX, was founded by Musk in 2002. SpaceX recently won a NASA contract to deliver cargo to the international space station when the space shuttle program is retired next year. That contract, worth $1.6 billion, was won over such industry mainstays as Boeing and Lockheed. The promise of a high-performance, all-electric vehicle became a reality with the startup's first model, the Tesla Roadster, a car with the look, speed and price tag -- a steep $109,000 and up -- that rivals other high-end, high-performance vehicles. Recently though, the economic downturn has forced Tesla to delay production of their would-be flagship Model S until 2011. They've also had to lay off more than 80 workers, which is about 25 percent of the company's staff. Nonetheless, Tesla predicts it will manufacture 20,000 Model S vehicles a year. That would make it more of a mass-market vehicle than the Roadster; only 1,200 of which are produced yearly. The company faces many challenges, the foremost of which is convincing consumers to pay almost $50,000 for an all-electric sedan when they could pay thousands less for another brand of upmarket sedan or a gas-electric hybrid.","Tesla says manufacturing plant will be in California; hundreds of jobs possible .

"ALPHARETTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Ben, who's 15 months old, can already do a lot of things. He can turn on a light or open a door. He can pick up a remote control off the floor. He can pull a heavy object with his teeth. Colise Johnson, 42, spent two weeks in September at a canine training camp getting acquainted with Ben. But Ben, a gangly golden retriever, is more than a family pet. He is a specially trained seizure dog who may one day be able to save the life of his new owner, Colise Johnson. ""Having epilepsy and cerebral palsy is kind of like having a nonstop roller coaster ride,"" said Johnson, 42, of Portland, Oregon. ""You never know what's going to happen, but with him, he slows the ride down so it's manageable."" Johnson, who uses a wheelchair and must wear a helmet because of persistent seizures, is among 3 million Americans who live with some form of epilepsy, a brain disorder that causes recurring seizures, violent muscle spasms or, sometimes, a loss of consciousness. There are no estimates of how many patients are paired up with assistance dogs, and the benefits of having such an animal have not been studied to any great extent. But Dr. Gregory Barkley, a neurologist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, and an adviser for the Epilepsy Foundation of America, believes nearly a quarter of the people who suffer from frequent, severe seizures might be helped by a canine companion. He said the dogs have ""an unqualified devotion to their master"" that may offer important mental health benefits. The dogs are sometimes credited with powers they really don't possess, Barkley said. ""The dog does not predict a seizure,"" he said. ""It may respond to the earlier stages of a seizure."" Johnson owned a seizure dog for 12 years before he died in 2007, ironically, having his own seizure.  Watch more on Ben and his new owner » . She recalled that the dog, named McKeever, ""told me ahead of time when I was going to have a seizure. ... He helped me get off the floor if I fell, helped me retrieve items, helped me get clothes out of the drawer for a bath, open the fridge on command and took out the recycling."" She said she'd felt lost without McKeever since his death, but that recently changed. Johnson spent two weeks in September at a training camp at Canine Assistants in Alpharetta, Georgia, getting acquainted with Ben. This year, Johnson was one of 1,100 people on the agency's waiting list. Jennifer Arnold founded the nonprofit service in 1991 and has placed more than 1,000 dogs with adults and children with physical disabilities or other special needs. ""We work primarily with people who have mobility issues and have conditions like muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and brain injuries,"" Arnold said. In the past few years, Arnold also helped train 100 seizure dogs to assist people with epilepsy. ""We train them to do basically 90 different commands,"" Arnold said. ""They learn to do things like go for help and press buttons to alert 9-1-1."" Over time, nearly all the dogs eventually develop the ability to identify the onset of a seizure, she said. ""We have no understanding of what it is that alerts the dogs that a seizure is oncoming,"" she said. ""Is it a smell that the body produces? We don't know to what stimuli the dog is responding."" By spending time with epilepsy patients, Arnold's dogs are taught what a seizure looks like and not to be frightened. Some dogs are able to anticipate a seizure 20 to 40 minutes before it happens. ""If the dog feels that their person is going to have a seizure, they tend to get very restless and distressed. ... They show signs of stress and agitation,"" Arnold said. ""Provided their human can read what that means, you have a really good alert system going on there."" Barkley has heard similar anecdotal information from his own epilepsy patients, but many of those dogs were simply family pets and were untrained, he said. He warned patients to be wary of agencies that charge a lot of money for a dog that may or may not be able to perform certain tasks. Canine Assistants offers its dogs free of charge to qualified patients. The group not only covers the cost of airfare and lodging during the training sessions, but it provides a lifetime of food and veterinary care at no cost. Arnold estimated the total value at $20,000 per dog. She said that a third of her company's operating costs are underwritten by large corporate grants. The rest of the money is raised through private donations. Arnold helped train some of the 140 dogs currently at the facility. She said she has no trouble letting the animals go to new homes because she knows they'll serve an important purpose, especially for the epilepsy patients. ""They become a prisoner,"" Arnold said. ""They don't want to leave the house ... they're so vulnerable. Just having this dog with you means that you're not ever alone."" Johnson, the married mother of a 15-year-old, is looking forward to regaining some independence with a new dog in the house. ""He's going to be able to give my family a break. He's going to be able to let them rest a little bit easier,"" she said. She also looked forward to a new reason to get out of bed in the morning. ""With the dog, instead of getting all bummed out or getting depressed over the seizures, I'll spend time with him and play with him and start laughing."" ""These dogs will change your life in such a way you won't know how you've lived without him once you've had them.""","Three million Americans live with epilepsy, which causes recurring seizures .

"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (CNN) -- Nearly 100 Thai soldiers crossed into Cambodian territory Wednesday near a disputed border temple that was the site of clashes last year, Cambodian officials said. Cambodian troops guard the Preah Vihear temple late last year amid heightened tensions with Thailand. The Thai army denied the claim. Thai soldiers crossed into the area of the 11th century Preah Vihear temple about 1:40 p.m., said Phay Siphan, secretary of the Cambodian Council of Ministers. The two sides did not fight and Cambodia has asked Thailand to pull back. Thai Army Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd said the troop movement was part of a normal rotation and that Thai soldiers had not gone anywhere they were not permitted to be. For months last year, the two countries saber-rattled over the ancient temple. The nations differ on whether some territory around the temple forms part of Thailand or Cambodia. Both countries posted troops in the area after the United Nations in July approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- a place the United Nations says has outstanding universal value. The temple sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962. Thailand claims, however, that the 4.6 sq. km (1.8 square mile) area around it was never fully demarcated. Thailand says the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia -- a map that places the temple and surrounding area in Cambodian territory. The United Nations' decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple. Last year's flare-up began July 15, when Cambodian guards briefly detained three Thais who crossed into the area. Once they were let go, the three refused to leave the territory. Cambodia claimed Thailand sent troops to retrieve the trio and gradually built up their numbers. Thailand denied that, saying its troops are deployed in Thai territory. -- CNN's Tim Schwarz in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Kocha Olarn in Bangkok, Thailand, contributed to this report.","Official: Thai soldiers crossed into area of 11th century Preah Vihear temple .

"(CNN) -- The body of a fugitive U.S. marshal has been found in the city of Juarez, Mexico, according to the U.S. Marshals Service -- the latest discovery in a wave of violence that has gripped towns along the U.S.-Mexican border in recent months. The body of Deputy Marshal Vincent Bustamante was found Wednesday in Juarez, Mexico. The body of Deputy Marshal Vincent Bustamante -- who faced federal charges of stealing weapons and other government property -- was found in Juarez on Wednesday, said Marshals Service spokesman Jeff Carter. Bustamante appeared to have been shot in the back of the head, a federal law enforcement source said. Chihuahua state police said the body had multiple wounds to the head -- apparently consistent with an execution-style shooting, according to Edgar Roman, a reporter with XHIJ television in Juarez.  Watch where the U.S. Marshal's body was found » . Bustamante, 48, was charged with stealing U.S. government property including Glock and Ruger handguns, a shotgun and a pair of binoculars, according to court documents. According to the federal source, who was not authorized to speak about details of the case and asked not to be named, a pawnshop owner became suspicious when Bustamante attempted to pawn a shotgun and called the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The source said Bustamante would buy back items he had pawned on his pay days and return them. Bustamante's attorney, Mike Torres, said a warrant was issued for Bustamante's arrest after he failed to appear at a court hearing last week. He said Bustamante was a 17-year veteran of the marshals and a former El Paso Police officer who lived in El Paso with his wife and two children. ""He was a familiar face around the federal courthouse here,"" Torres said. ""I'm very shocked by this and very saddened. ""He had a lot of friends and a lot of people that cared about him."" Carter said Bustamante was on administrative leave from the marshals and had been required to turn in his gun and badge. He said Bustamante had not been in Mexico on marshals business and that all of the weapons he was charged with stealing had been recovered. Carter said Bustamante was on ""modified status"" with the marshals, meaning he had been required to turn in his gun and badge outside of his official work hours. ""What I can tell you is that the U.S. Marshals Service is saddened by the death of Deputy Bustamante and our thoughts and prayers are with his family,"" he said. Carter said U.S. marshals are working with the FBI and Mexican authorities to investigate the death. He said an autopsy will be conducted in Mexico, and another may be conducted once Bustamante's body is returned to the United States. Juarez, which sits across the border from El Paso, Texas, has become one of the major battlegrounds as drug cartels fight both each other and Mexican authorities. The conflict has made violence increasingly common in Juarez, Tijuana and other Mexican border towns. More than 400 deaths in the region have been attributed to the fighting this year. CNN's Anderson Cooper, Emily Robards and Devon Sayers contributed to this report.","Marshal's body found in border town of Juarez, Mexico .

"(CNN)  -- A Russian heavy missile cruiser stopped three pirate ships off the coast of Somalia, and detained 10 pirates, according to a statement released Friday by Russian Navy headquarters in Moscow. Russian missile cruiser ""Peter the Great"" moored in Cape Town, South Africa, last month. The cruiser, Peter the Great, halted two small high-speed motor boats and a mid-size, support vessel on Thursday, the Russians said. ""Ten pirates have been detained. All of them are citizens of Somalia,"" the press release obtained by CNN stated. ""Officials from the Northern Fleet's military prosecutor's office are currently questioning the detainees aboard the Peter the Great. Their future will be decided in coordination with the Russian Foreign and Justice ministries."" The Russians said a Russian helicopter Ka-27, which took off from the cruiser, had located two small boats, which were moving toward an Iranian fishing vessel at high speed last Thursday. When those in the boats spotted the helicopter overhead, the boats began slowing down, then veered off toward their support vessel, which was adrift nearby. The helicopter crew could see pirates in the two motor boats throwing weapons into the sea, and kept chasing the boats until the Russian cruiser arrived in the area. ""The three boats were (captured and) delivered to the Peter the Great, and ten Somalian pirates were taken aboard. ""The detainees possessed weapons, including a G-3 rifle, an Ak-47, two AKMS machine-guns, two grenade-launchers and two anti-infantry grenades, and also had a GPS receiver, a ladder, 500 grams of drugs, a large amount of money, a bag of sugar and a bag of rice. The detained pirates were high on drugs,"" the press release said. Meanwhile, Somali pirates have released a Panamanian-flagged, Japanese-owned vessel that was hijacked in the Gulf of Aden in November, according to a non-governmental group that monitors piracy. The ship, named the MT Chemstar Venus, was released late Thursday, according to Ecoterra International. The 18 Filipino and five South Korean crew members were reportedly unharmed. The International Maritime Board, a group that also monitors piracy, told CNN that the company had not confirmed the release of the ship, but said shipping companies sometimes wait a few days before going public to ensure the safety of the crew. The ship was hijacked on November 15. It was unclear whether the pirates were paid a ransom to release the ship. This incident comes a week after Somali pirates released a Ukrainian ship carrying tanks, ammunition and crew after receiving a ransom of $3.2 million. -- CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","Russian cruiser halted two small high-speed motor boats and a support vessel .

"(CNN) -- Erik Roberts, an Army sergeant who was wounded in Iraq, underwent his 13th surgery recently to save his right leg from amputation. Imagine his shock when he got a bill for $3,000 for his treatment. Army Sgt. Erik Roberts was badly wounded in Iraq with two comrades in April 2006. ""I just thought it was bull---- that I'm getting billed for being wounded in Iraq doing my job. I always put the mission first, and now that I was wounded in Iraq, they're sending me bills,"" he said. ""I put my life on the line and I was wounded in combat, and I came back and they're not going to take care of my medical bills?"" It's a level of outrage shared by his mother, as well as the doctor who performed the surgery. ""It's hard to understand why we're not taking care of guys like Erik whose injuries are clearly related to their service. They deserve the best care of anybody,"" said Dr. William Obremskey, an Air Force veteran and surgeon at Vanderbilt Orthopaedics in Nashville, Tennessee.  ""For him to be responsible for $3,000, I think, is a little ridiculous or is uncalled for, particularly in this situation."" His mother, Robin Roberts, put it more succinctly: ""Why should any soldier pay one penny of a medical bill from injuries that occurred while they were fighting in a war? That's what really frustrates me."" The Department of Veterans Affairs has now decided to pay his bill, but only after prodding from a U.S. senator who got involved after CNN brought it to his attention. Roberts, of Warren, Ohio, is one of more than 31,100 U.S. troops to have been wounded in Iraq. An additional 4,262 have died in the war. Roberts was wounded April 25, 2006, when roadside bombs tore through his Humvee in western Baghdad. Heat from the flames ignited the Humvee's ammunition, which popped off all around.  See Roberts describe getting blown up » . Roberts and his buddies, A.J. Jefferson and Luke Murphy, were badly wounded and bleeding on the ground after jumping from the burning vehicle. They were saved by comrades who rushed to help them. ""The truck automatically filled with smoke. There was fire coming from the middle of the truck. And I just feel my whole right side just like kind of explode,"" Roberts said. ""I thought at that moment that my life was over, so I started praying."" All three soldiers survived the attack, but Murphy lost his leg. Days later, on his 23rd birthday, Roberts returned to the States. He underwent a series of life-saving surgeries, including 12 different ones to repair his fractured right leg. A metal rod was inserted in his upper leg to help the fracture heal. He retired from the Army in October 2007, because of his war injuries, and enrolled in college last fall at Youngstown State University, majoring in finance and minoring in economics. But in December, he says, a golf ball-sized lump appeared on his wounded leg. He says he went to a Veterans Affairs hospital and was told not to worry about it. A few days later, he says, he went to the emergency room after the lump flared up more. A doctor there, he says, told him that the leg was badly infected and that it might have to be amputated. Desperate for help, his mother contacted the Army surgeon who had saved her son's life two years earlier. That doctor referred him to Obremskey, the Vanderbilt surgeon. The Robertses say the VA did not approve of them going outside the system. Erik Roberts says he had no choice -- it was have surgery or potentially lose his leg. ""I thought my leg was more important than the usual bureaucratic mess,"" he said. His leg was saved. The $3,000 billed to Roberts wasn't for the surgery itself. It's a portion of the bill for six weeks of daily antibiotics to prevent the infection from coming back. His private insurance plan picked up the majority of the $90,000 in costs. Roberts has been administering the drugs himself -- up to seven IVs a day, with a nurse coming to his home once a week to check on him. At one point, his mom says, the insurance company suggested the war veteran should be put in a nursing home to receive the round-the-clock antibiotics. ""Now why would you want to put an injured soldier who is 25 years old in a nursing home to get IVs?"" Robin Roberts said. ""He said, 'Send me home and teach me to do it myself.' "" Roberts has also paid for his travel expenses from Ohio to Tennessee for treatment. He fears how much of the $57,000 surgery bill he will owe and how much he might be billed for his emergency room visit in December. His schooling has been put on hold because of his surgery and lengthy recovery. ""These soldiers and young men and women fight for our country and our freedom, only to come back to have to fight for their health and their life back in the United States,"" Robin Roberts said. Dr. Obremskey said it's ""frustrating"" to hear about cases like Roberts'. He says the lesson from Roberts' story is ""pretty obvious."" ""If they're injured in the service to our country, we should continue to take care of them even if they are discharged from active duty because of their injuries. Some mechanism ought to be available for them to obtain whatever care they need,"" Obremskey said. CNN on Wednesday contacted the office of Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Roberts' home state of Ohio who serves on the Senate's VA committee. Brown's office had not heard of Roberts' case, but immediately reached out to the soldier and alerted the VA about his situation. In less than 24 hours, the VA got back to CNN. ""The VA will be paying the bill,"" said VA spokesman Sean Nelson. The VA did not offer an explanation as to how something like this could happen. Brown's office issued a written statement, applauding the decision. ""Sen. Brown is pleased to hear that Mr. Roberts will not have out-of-pocket costs for a service-connected injury. However, he believes it should not take the intervention of a U.S. senator for our veterans to receive the care they've been promised."" Roberts said he appreciates the help. Despite everything he's experienced, Roberts -- who went into the Army just after high school -- said he would never trade in being a member of the 101st Airborne. ""I will always be proud I served my country, and proud that I was able to wear that flag on my shoulder,"" he said. ""I would defend this country against anyone, and I'm proud to wear that uniform."" CNN's Thom Patterson contributed to this story.","Wounded soldier gets billed $3,000 for wounds suffered in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Five days of gunbattles between the Indian army and separatist militants in Indian-administered Kashmir have left at least 25 dead -- eight Indian army troopers, including one officer, and 17 militants, the Indian military said Tuesday. An Indian army soldier lays a wreath during the funeral of a slain soldier, northeast of Srinagar on Tuesday. Defense Minister A.K. Antony, meeting with India's military chiefs in Delhi, reviewed the situation in the Himalayan region and told the Army to deal with the situation in the Himalayan region with ""utmost firmness."" Kashmir has been in the throes of a violent separatist campaign for nearly two decades during which authorities say 43,000 people have been killed. However, various NGOs and rights groups put the number of dead at twice the official count. In Srinigar, Kashmir, Army spokesman Lt. Col. J.S. Brar told CNN the Army was moving against the militants ""based on sound intelligence inputs as well as human intelligence provided by our own sources."" The battles in the Shamsbhari forests of north Kashmir Kupwara district have caused ""minimum collateral damage to property,"" Brar said. The spokesman denied media reports that helicopter gunships and heavy weapons had been used by the army during these operations against the militants. This month's encounter between the Indian Army and the militants is the second longest in Kashmir this year. In January, a fierce encounter raged for seven days in the Poonch district of Jammu region of Indian-administered Kashmir. Two soldiers, a policeman and four militants were killed in that encounter. Kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between India and neighboring Pakistan. Both control parts of the region which is predominantly Muslim.","NEW: 25 dead in Kashmir gunfights between Indian troops, separatist militants .

"(CNN)  -- A 75th minute strike by striker Graziano Pelle gave AZ Alkmaar a 1-0 home win over NEC Nijmegen on Sunday to leave his side top of the Dutch standings. Italian star Pelle scored the winner to keep AZ on top heading into the Dutch break. The Italian's decisive goal means Louis van Gaal's men will head into 2009 with a three-point lead over Ajax Amsterdam after 17 rounds. The Eredivisie is set to resume on January 16 after a three-week break. Earlier, Dario Cvitanich scored a hat-trick as Ajax beat ADO Den Haag 3-0 to temporarily draw level on points with the leaders. But AZ, who are unbeaten in 15 games, then saw off Nijmegen, who had also been on a fine 14-game unbeaten run. AZ have 41 points, with Ajax on 38. Steve McClaren's FC Twente are in third place, seven points adrift of AZ, after holding defending champions PSV Eindhoven to a goalless draw on Saturday. PSV are fourth with 30 points and looking set to relinquish their league title. On Friday, Feyenoord snapped a run of three successive losses by beating NAC Breda 3-1, but the struggling Rotterdam giants are in 12th spot.","AZ Alkmaar beat NEC Nijmegen 1-0 in Dutch league game on Sunday .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- China's military is developing longer-range ballistic and anti-ship missiles that are ""shifting the balance of power in the region"" and could help Beijing secure resources or settle territorial disputes, a report released by the Pentagon said Wednesday. U.S. and Chinese militaries need ""resumption of dialogue,""  Adm. Timothy Keating told Congress. China also continues to build up short-range missiles and increase its ""coercive capabilities"" against Taiwan. The report suggests such moves constitute an effort to pressure Taiwan into settling the cross-strait dispute in favor of China, though tensions between the two countries have receded over the past year. The report, called the ""Military Power of the People's Republic of China,"" is the Pentagon's annual briefing to Congress on the status of the communist country's military might. While China continues to proclaim that its military buildup is for defense purposes to protect its interests, the report says the country's lack of transparency is worrisome and could lead to an unintended conflict. ""The limited transparency in China's military and security affairs poses risks to stability by creating uncertainty and increasing the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation,"" according to the report. ""Much uncertainty surrounds China's future course, particularly regarding how its expanding military power might be used."" The lack of transparency causes Washington ""to speculate to some degree on what their intentions are,"" Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell told reporters at a Wednesday briefing. According to Adm. Timothy Keating, the head of the U.S. Pacific Command, some of that uncertainty is due to the cessation of talks between the Chinese and U.S. militaries. In March of 2008, the United States and China installed a hot line between the two countries' militaries. But there have been no military-to-military talks since November 2008, when Washington announced it was selling weapons to Taiwan. ""We are looking for the resumption of that dialogue so we can engage in discussion with our colleagues in the People's Republic of China and their Army, Navy and Air Force so we can have a sense of their way ahead,"" Keating told the House Armed Services committee on Tuesday. ""We don't have a clear idea of their broad strategic way ahead."" The Pentagon report comes after a recent incident in which Chinese ships, including a Chinese navy vessel, confronted an unarmed U.S. Navy surveillance ship in the South China Sea in international waters. The confrontation prompted the United States to move a destroyer ship to the area to protect the surveillance vessel. While the report does not discuss the incident, it notes the importance China puts on controlling its waterways and the surrounding territories because ""China's economic and political power is contingent upon access to and use of the sea, and that a strong navy is required to safeguard such access."" The analysis also said that while much of China's capability is more for regional disputes, it did send two destroyers and one supply ship off the coast of Africa to protect Chinese vessels from pirate attacks. That move was a sign of Chinese intent to expand its militaries to protect expanding economic and political interests around the world, according to a China analyst. ""The Chinese military is being told to develop capabilities to deal with Chinese national interests beyond the pure defense of Chinese territory,"" said David Finklestein, the Director of China Studies for CNA, a nonprofit research group that does analysis for the U.S. military and other clients. ""China, with a global economy, now obviously has global political interests and clearly has expanding global security interests."" Though the Pentagon report concludes that ""China's ability to sustain military power at a distance remains limited,"" it does have a growing space program, nuclear weapon system and cyber warfare capabilities, ""the only aspects of China's armed forces that, today, have the potential to be truly global,"" the report explained. In citing China's cyber warfare, the report notes that U.S. government computers were the target of ""intrusions that appear to have originated"" from China, although they were not confirmed to be from the military.","Pentagon report: China's missile development ""shifting balance of power in region""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Only a few states have laws that adequately equip teen victims of dating violence with tools for protection and safety, according to a new report from a watchdog group. Twenty-three states received sub-par grades in a report focusing on state laws focusing on protective orders. The report by Los Angeles, California-based Break the Cycle includes state-by-state report cards that measure how each state treats teen victims of dating violence in comparison with the treatment of adult domestic violence victims. Only five states -- California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Hampshire and Oklahoma -- received As, while nine states received B's. Twenty-three states received sub-par grades, including 11 getting Fs. ""I think what the state report cards are telling us is that states have a long way to go before they are protecting minors in abusive relationships,"" Marjorie Gilberg, Break the Cycle's executive director, told CNN Radio. The report focuses on how easy it is for a teen to obtain a protective order in the event of abuse, including whether state law allows a minor to take out an order, if adult permission is required and whether an order can be issued against another minor. New Hampshire, which got an A, is the only state where the law specifically allows minors to apply for a protection order, according to the report. Missouri, which got an F, makes such orders available only to adults.  See how the different states scored » . Nine states allow minors to obtain protective orders without adult approval if they meet certain criteria, such as being a minimum age, often 16, or having a specific relationship with the abuser, such as having a child together. ""What we hope to achieve with this is to call out the states that are not doing a good job protecting minors and help people in those states call on their legislators to make change,"" Gilberg said. One in five teens who have been in a ""serious relationship"" report being hit, slapped or pushed by a partner, according to the National Teen Dating Abuse Helpline. One in three girls who have been in such a relationship say they've been concerned about being physically hurt by their partner. Gilberg said that since the 2008 report cards came out, several states worked to change their laws to address the rights of minor victims in domestic violence statutes, though some were more successful than others. This year's report noted that eight states improved their grades. Among them, Florida jumped from a D to a B for making protective orders ""relatively accessible"" to teen victims without an adult's approval if they are dating the abuser. The process was described as ""extremely difficult"" the previous year because state law did not specify whether a minor could petition for one alone. ""Even when you have an A grade,"" Gilberg said, ""you still can do things to make the law more protective of minors who are in teen dating violence relationships.""","Report focuses on ease with which teens can obtain protective orders .

"(CNN)  -- Researchers have raised the alert status at Mount Redoubt, a volcano in southern Alaska, after another increase in seismic activity. Seismic activity at Alaska's Mount Redoubt again has scientists watching for an eruption. ""Shallow earthquake activity under the volcano has been as high as 26 events per 10-minute period,"" officials at the Alaska Volcano Observatory said Sunday in a statement announcing that the alert level was raised to ""watch"" status. Although no eruption has occurred, the scientists said the increase in seismic activity ""likely represents either the upward movement of magma or pressurization of the system."" ""It is possible for unrest at the volcano to change rapidly, and seismic activity or other signs of unrest could escalate culminating in an eruption within days to weeks,"" the statement concluded. An increase in seismic activity at the same volcano prompted a ""watch"" level last Monday. In the U.S. Geological Survey's color-coded alert levels, the orange ""watch"" level means the volcano ""is exhibiting heightened or escalating unrest with increased potential of eruption"" or that ""eruption is underway with no or minor volcanic-ash emissions."" The next level is red, meaning an eruption is imminent or underway. Bill Burton, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said since January there have been increases in seismic activity at Mount Redoubt followed by periods of quiet. The 10,197-foot peak is about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage, the most populous city in Alaska. Mount Redoubt last erupted nearly 20 years ago, in December 1989. That eruption lasted until April 1990.","Increase in seismic activity noted at Mount Redoubt in southern Alaska .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Rap star T.I. was sentenced in Atlanta federal court Friday to one year and one day in prison and ordered to pay a $100,300 fine on weapons charges related to purchasing machine guns and silencers. T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, has mentored at-risk students as part of his community service. The rapper, whose real name is Clifford Harris, reached the terms of the sentence in a plea agreement with prosecutors last year. ""I would like to say thank you to some, and apologize to others,"" Harris said at his sentencing. ""In my life, I have been placed in the worst-case scenario and had to make the best of it,"" he said. ""Most often, things I have learned have been from trial and error. I knew no way to protect myself than to arm myself."" He was dressed in a gray suit and black shirt and tie. Harris, 28, also was sentenced to some property forfeiture, supervised release for three years after his prison sentence, 365 days of home confinement and 1,500 hours of community service. He has already served 305 days of home confinement and 1,030 hours of service. He also must undergo DNA testing and drug counseling, cannot own firearms and must submit to reasonable searches and a financial audit.  Watch the rapper's interview with CNN's T.J. Holmes » . ""We are very pleased with the result in this case,"" U.S. Attorney David E. Nahmias said. ""Mr. Harris has received a significant penalty for the serious firearms offenses he committed. ... ""His prison sentence was reduced from what it might have been, but the public got something very significant in exchange: the extensive and unique community service program that Mr. Harris committed to doing when he pleaded guilty. ""By all accounts, his community service has been a remarkable success -- it certainly exceeded our expectations -- and there is still more to come when he gets out of prison.""  Watch T.I. urge others to learn from his mistakes » . Former Atlanta Mayor and U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young spoke on behalf of Harris, comparing black-on-black violence to the Ku Klux Klan decades ago. Young said he regarded working with Harris not so much as a chance to help him but more as ""an opportunity for him to help me."" ""We hit it off immediately,"" Young said. ""It was a grandfather type of relationship."" Bishop Eddie Long of the New Birth Baptist Church also spoke in support of Harris. Harris will be taken into custody no earlier than May 19. The plea agreement, which federal authorities called unique, allowed the rapper to remain out of prison for a year while he performed community service. In that time, he mentored at-risk students at 58 schools, 12 Boys & Girls Clubs, nine churches and many other nonprofit organizations, according to court documents. Young said he and Harris went to a hospital for paraplegics in New York. ""He heard the testimonies of guys in their 50s and 60s who talked about being shot back when they were 16,"" Young said. ""A perfect example for me in my ministry, and that wouldn't be possible without the willingness of this court to try new things."" Meanwhile, the rapper has released his sixth CD, ""Paper Trail,"" which has sold close to 2 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The multiplatinum rapper also has starred in the MTV reality show, ""T.I.'s Road to Redemption: 45 Days to Go,"" which chronicles his efforts to shave years off his sentence by completing his community service. The show features him talking to schools and community groups ""about how to avoid the trouble he now finds himself in,"" according to the network's Web site. Harris' fall from grace was sudden and dramatic, played out on the streets of his hometown of Atlanta in 2007. That year, Harris had starred in the film ""ATL"" and could be seen in Chevy commercials with NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. Harris had been named to the Forbes list of top-earning rappers, banking an estimated $16 million in 2006. Then he was arrested in October 2007 in an Atlanta parking lot hours before he was to perform at the BET Hip Hop Awards. Harris was caught in a federal sting after his bodyguard-turned-informant delivered three machine guns and two silencers to him, prosecutors said. The rapper had provided the bodyguard with $12,000 to buy the weapons. Harris was not permitted to own any guns, however, because he was convicted in 1998 on felony drug charges -- possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute -- in Cobb County, in suburban Atlanta. For his court hearing Friday, Harris' attorneys submitted more than 100 letters from officials who thanked him for his community service since the weapons arrest. One of the letters was from Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears, who said Harris did an ""outstanding job"" talking to a group of teenagers about not breaking the law. ""If only one young person in that courtroom listened to Mr. Harris -- and I believe they all did -- we are all better for it,"" Sears wrote. ""He was honest, humble and inspirational.""

"(CNN) -- Conjoined Egyptian twin boys Hassan and Mahmoud, who were successfully separated in Saudi Arabia Saturday, are recovering and are expected to lead normal lives, officials said. Conjoined twins Hassan, left, and Mahmud rest the day before separation surgery in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Imagine the Batmobile busting bad guys in Bismarck, North Dakota, or ""Knight Rider's"" KITT corralling criminals on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Carbon Motors Corp.'s E7 concept vehicle was on display recently near the U.S. Capitol. Carbon Motors Corp.'s new high-tech cop car prototype might not be quite up to superhero specs, but some police say it could be a welcome addition to their arsenal. ""I don't see any downside to this car,"" said Carl Latorre, a Pennsylvania State Police dispatcher who served 35 years as a Philadelphia police officer. ""I am so excited about this car. This car rates up there with cops carrying automatic weapons to combat what the criminals carry now. It's about time that something like this came about."" OK, so it doesn't have a nanotech cloaking capability or rocket boosters, but every feature on the Carbon E7 concept vehicle draws on suggestions from more than 3,000 law enforcement professionals. The result is a futuristic prowler with a 300-horsepower clean diesel engine, flashing lights visible from all angles, an ergonomic cockpit, an onboard computer with voice command and instant license plate recognition, integrated shotgun mounts, and more. (Weapons of mass destruction detectors are available as an option -- seriously.)  See how the E7 stacks up against KITT and the Dark Knight's Tumbler » . The E7 was designed by cops for cops, breaking the tradition of recruiting family sedans into the force, company co-founder Stacy Dean Stephens said. ""The current vehicles that they (police departments) use were designed for driving around, going to the grocery store, taking kids to school -- things like that,"" Stephens said. ""You don't have an engineer sitting at one of the other automakers who says, 'Y'know, I think what we need to do is we need to take this car, and we need to run into a curb at 50 miles an hour and see how many times it takes before the wheels and the suspension fails on it."" The rear passenger compartment alone is enough to make experienced cops get teary-eyed. The rear-hinged ""suicide doors"" make it easier for handcuffed passengers to get in and out, and the seat is designed so ""guests"" can ride comfortably with their hands cuffed behind their backs. For officer safety, Latorre likes how the seat belts are anchored in the center of the seat and buckle near the door so the officer doesn't have to lean across the prisoner. ""When you put a prisoner in the back seat, you're supposed to strap him in,"" Latorre said. ""Nowadays, you have to make sure your gun isn't going close to his hands, and how are you going to strap somebody in doing that?"" Perhaps most popular among cops is the rear compartment, which is sealed off from the front and made entirely of seamless, washable plastic, with drain plugs in the floor. ""Numerous times I've had less than pleasant experience"" with prisoners vomiting or relieving themselves in the back seat, said Stephens, a former Texas police officer. The seat innovations are up front, too, where the seats have recesses to accommodate officers' bulky gun belts. ""The front seat -- I couldn't believe the front seat. They thought of everything,"" Latorre said. ""You don't know how difficult it is to get out of a car. The first thing you've got to do is adjust your gun belt. The gun belt shouldn't be a problem."" The E7 can go 0 to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds, has a top speed of 155 mph and can withstand a 75-mph rear impact, according to the company's Web site. It has bullet-resistant panels in the doors and dash and has push bumpers incorporated into the aluminum frame. The upper flashing lights are integrated into the roof panel, eliminating the need for a bolted-on light bar that causes aerodynamic drag -- reducing fuel economy -- and can lead to rust.  Watch police check out the car and hear the engine growl » . Despite the technological ""wow"" factor and officer enthusiasm, the E7 could prove to be a tough sell. ""The people are very intelligent and smart that are setting this up,"" said Lt. Michael Arnold, fleet manager of the Bismarck, North Dakota, police department. ""What scares me is they don't give you a price."" Company officials say the price -- possibly around $50,000 per unit -- will be ""competitive"" considering the cost of equipping a conventional car for police work and how long each vehicle lasts. The Carbon E7 will be built to last 250,000 miles, compared with 75,000 to 120,000 miles for the typical patrol car, Stephens said. ""When it's all said and done it's a matter of how much it costs per mile,"" said Bismarck Deputy Chief Fred Wooten. Regardless of how good it looks on paper, a state or big-city agency won't be willing to take a chance on a vehicle with no track record, said Detective Mary Wheat, spokesperson for the Portland, Oregon, police department. ""If they do cost $50,000, nobody's going to buy them,"" Wheat said. ""Nobody's going to buy them. No, police agencies can't afford $50,000 cars. We have huge fleets of cars. We have hundreds of them; hundreds and hundreds of cars. And we turn them over. I mean, we ride them hard. Those cars are used on a 24-hour basis. That wouldn't work."" But municipalities don't balk at paying large sums for other purpose-built vehicles such as firetrucks and ambulances, countered Latorre, the Pennsylvania officer. ""They don't say, 'Oh, here's a box truck; go fight fires with it' or 'Here's an E-250 cargo van; go pick up patients with it,' do they?,"" he said. ""So I don't see why the municipality wouldn't say, 'You know what? This [police car] is nothing but a plus for us.'"" The company, based in Atlanta, Georgia, doesn't yet have a factory, but has named five states where it could locate: Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina and South Carolina. Production is scheduled to begin in 2012, Stephens said. Carbon doesn't expect to take over the market quickly, instead counting on a few ""early adopters"" willing to take a risk on a few vehicles and work out the kinks to everyone else's satisfaction, Stephens said. Hundreds of agencies already have made online reservations for thousands of Carbon Motors vehicles, putting the company ""very well on our way to selling out our first year,"" he said. Wheat praised the Carbon team's entrepreneurship and suggested the company market its car first in smaller towns with less red tape and simpler bidding processes. That works for Wooten, the deputy chief in Bismarck. ""We'll be more than happy to field test one,"" he offered. ""If it works as advertised, we'll probably have a fleet of them someday.""","Carbon Motors' E7 prototype is not your father's Crown Victoria .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Picture this: The European champions and current highest-ranked soccer team in the world, Spain, are beaten 3-0...by a team of robots. On the way: Robots are developing steadily towards the goal of beating humans at football. It may sound ridiculous, but robot developers in Asia, the U.S. and Europe are dreaming of that very goal. Working under the umbrella organizations FIRA (Federation of Robot-Soccer Association) and the RoboCup Federation, researchers and developers are aiming to advance robot technology to the point that a team of humanoids can beat the best humans in the sport by 2050. Since robot soccer competitions began in the mid-1990s, researchers have already made significant developments towards their goal. Phil Culverhouse of the Center for Robotics and Intelligent Systems at the University of Plymouth told CNN that the first robots in competition were controlled by humans and many were on wheels or four-legged, but that is changing. ""Since 2007 the team have progressed to bipedal robots that have cameras on board,"" he said. ""Our robots are autonomous -- they have no control from outside sources. The cameras try to work out where the goal is, where the ball is and where the other players are."" Further robotic developments appear to be close. Researchers at Carlos III University of Madrid released a study in the March 2009 online edition of 'Expert Systems with Applications,' showing they had refined a technique known as machine-learning. Basically, the scientists were able to teach a virtual player simple reactions to visual stimuli -- based upon how real humans react in the same situation. Do you think robots will one day be able to beat humans at football? Sound Off box below. This year robots will go head-to-head at both the RoboCup event in Austria in June/July and the FIRA RoboWorld Cup in Korea in August. The most advanced classes at present are the bipedal classes for 'humanoid' robots. Co-chair of RoboCup 2009, Gerald Steinbauer, told CNN this year's event was the 13th edition of the cup, and he was impressed by progress by advances since the competitions began. ""At the last RoboCup in China 2008 we had games of teams of three humanoid playing attractive soccer. They walk on two feet, fight for the ball and of course score... so we are approaching the goal,"" he said. Culverhouse said interest in both events had steadily grown, especially since the two-legged robots had been introduced. This year up to 3,000 competitors from 40 countries are expected at RoboCup. ""This has been extremely effective in gaining interest. These are much more exciting to watch. We have seen a steep level of change in interest from not just young people but everybody."" Despite the increasing profile, Culverhouse said there are still plenty of major challenges before the humanoids can seriously compete with humans. ""This is still a long way from competing against humans. The next big challenge to be met is to get robots walking like humans and then running like humans. ""One of the most challenging things is getting a robot to walk on uneven terrain without falling over,"" he said, explaining that some fall over after kicking at goal. (Although, it's not hard to think of professional footballers who have suffered the same problem.) The University of Plymouth team is currently researching how robot's feet can be improved, and hope to release a concept later this year that could usher in a new era of in foot design. For Steinbauer, the critical issues are that of perception and cognitive abilities. ""Perception is one of our major problems. It is important that a robot is able to understand a scene like a human does. If you enter a complete unknown room you are able to recognize the important things like furniture and also relations and functions of objects very fast,"" he said. ""Despite huge progress in this area we are far behind the capabilities of animals or humans. ""And of course there's cognitive capabilities. To reason about new, uncertain or even inconsistent facts is easy for a human but very hard for a robot,"" Steinbauer said. Size and cost are other limiting issues. ""In order to make this affordable we are developing robots 50 to 60 centimeters high. At that size each robot costs about 10,000 pounds to make. At full human size each would cost about 50,000 pounds,"" Culverhouse said. Soccer is an ideal testing ground for robotics as it encompasses many different elements including movement, vision and strategy, Steinbauer said. But the applications developed in these robots could serve a greater purpose. Steinbauer said robot technologies could be used for entertainment or performing simple tasks around the home and office. They also could be used in rescue scenarios -- where robots could be sent into dangerous situations in place of humans, he said.","FIRA and RoboCup organizations promoting development of robots .

"(CNN)  -- Manchester United went five points clear at the top of the Premier League as goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar set a new English record for minutes in not conceding a goal in the 1-0 victory over Everton. Van der Sar was left to celebrate a United win and a new goalkeeping record. Cristiano Ronaldo grabbed the winning goal with a 44th minute penalty but once again it was United's rock-solid defense and keeper that made sure of the vital three points. Everton's failure to score by the 73rd minute at Old Trafford left van der Sar unbeaten for 1,104 minutes. The Dutch international was breaking the previous record set by Reading's Steve Death 30 years ago. He had taken Petr Cech's Premier League record in the 5-0 win at West Bromwich Albion last week and has now had 12 straight clean sheets. With title rivals Chelsea and Liverpool playing each other on Sunday and Aston Villa being held 0-0 at home by Wigan, the record was the icing on the cake for Alex Ferguson's defending champions. World footballer of the year Ronaldo had hit the post in the first half before converting from the spot after Michael Carrick was tripped by Mikel Arteta. In truth, Everton, missing three strikers through injury, rarely troubled van der Sar with most of the action at the other end. Carrick had appeals for a second penalty turned down after appearing to be brought down by Joleon Lescott, but referee Mark Halsey ignored his pleas. Carlos Tevez shot wide from Park ji-Sung's right wing cross and Tim Howard later had to save smartly from a deflected free kick from the Argentine star. United manager Alex Ferguson was delighted with yet another clean sheet and the three points. ""It's a fantastic performance from the boys. I couldn't believe it when I read that the last goal we conceded was against Arsenal in October,"" he told Setanta Sports. ""Van der Sar brings calmness and assurance. Over the last 12 games we have changed the back four I don't know how many times so you have to give great credit to them.""","Record breaker Edwin van der Sar has now kept 12 clean sheets for United .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- There's the Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls: blending her voice with singing partner Emily Saliers on songs such as ""Closer to Fine"" and ""Galileo"" and writing songs that tap into the duo's shared folk-oriented touchstones. Amy Ray says playing with some musician friends brought out songs that ""felt very different from the Indigo Girls."" Then there's Amy Ray the solo artist, letting out her inner Joe Strummer and Paul Westerberg. The two aren't mutually exclusive, of course. ""Emily and I are frustrated sometimes with any kind of box,"" Ray says during an interview at her manager's office near downtown Atlanta, ""because we want to experiment musically, and we do a lot of electric stuff. ... But the reality is that we are a folk band."" However, Ray adds, her influences include artists who have come out of a punk mindset such as the Clash, the Replacements, the Pretenders and Patti Smith. ""At some point I was hanging around with the Butchies -- a band I ended up playing with a lot -- and it just brought out this thing in me ... and it felt very different from the Indigo Girls,"" she says. Which explains the appearance of ""Didn't It Feel Kinder"" (Daemon), Ray's third solo album.  Watch Ray perform the song ""She's Got to Be"" » . (Disclosure: Ray and I were contemporaries at Atlanta's Emory University, but we didn't know one another.) The songs on ""Kinder"" include ""Bus Bus,"" a scorching rocker about the longings felt while on tour; ""Who Sold the Gun,"" which alludes to a mass shooting, counterpointed by rousing major chords; and ""SLC Radio,"" which praises the support of a Salt Lake City radio station in the midst of ""LDS nation."" Ray gives a great deal of credit to producer Greg Griffith for the album's raw sound and melodic ideas, and she adds that the musicians on the solo album helped guide the way the songs were presented. ""Something like 'Bus Bus,' I wanted this lead thing going on with a kind of raucous band, and the harmonies are very important but they are more of a bed that you're singing over rather than the duo,"" she says. ""I think the musicians I play with solo do a certain thing that the musicians we play with with the Indigo Girls don't do. It's just a different thing. ... And it sort of steers my writing in some ways."" A number of the solo songs do share the same activist outlook as Ray's songs with the Indigo Girls. ""SLC Radio,"" for example, is about KRCL-FM, which Ray describes as ""a really progressive community station."" In the song, Ray, an out lesbian, sings ""Radio radio SLC fighting the good fight for me/ Boys and girls lend a hand, bend an ear in God's land."" ""I was thinking about community radio in general, and I was thinking about Mormonism and the fabric of the country and how much you see when you're traveling ... and the idea that change comes, but it comes slow, and it comes one person at a time,"" she explains. But, she notes, ""The song is not totally taking Mormonism to task. I even say, 'I'm sending love to all the Mormons,' 'Keep the good things throw out the bad.' "" Respect flows both ways, she says. Ray's activism extends to the artist-centered Daemon Records, the label she founded in 1990. Though Daemon is the furthest thing from corporate -- Ray and the label's staff still stuff envelopes themselves -- she acknowledges that changes in the record business have forced her to adjust as much as any major label.  Watch Ray on keeping the business going » . ""For indie labels it was a big adjustment because we ended up with a lot of CDs on hand when downloading [happened]. We knew it was coming, it came, but it happened a little bit faster [than we thought],"" she says. ""There were business decisions that were hard. ... But I love the freedom that downloading has brought, and I love the way it saves resources."" Besides, she adds, ""The Internet has revolutionized the DIY movement, and it's great to me. I don't even know if record labels need to exist. I don't even know if I need to exist,"" she laughs. But some things about being a musician don't change, such as promotion and performance, which means it's time to hit the road again. Ray will perform with the Indigo Girls in September and then do some solo dates for the rest of the year. A new Indigo Girls album is due out in early 2009. Isn't it exhausting, after more than 20 years in the business, to have to get on the bus again? Ray agrees that touring can be draining. ""It's like you're doing all this stuff, the traveling and the unpacking and the packing, just to play the show. And in that one ... moment during the show, that's the fun. That's where all the fun is,"" she says. ""It's the blessing and the curse of it. ""But it's not like digging a ditch,"" she adds. ""You get to see different places, get to go running in a different town every day. It's very stimulating, and that can be a very good thing.""","Indigo Girl Amy Ray has solo album out, ""Didn't It Feel Kinder""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The agency that owns the space where the World Trade Center towers stood is freeing itself of the term ""freedom"" to describe the signature skyscraper replacing the buildings destroyed on September 11, 2001. The One World Trade Center skyscraper is expected to be completed in late 2013. The change from Freedom Tower was revealed Thursday at a news conference where the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced the signing of the first commercial lease in the building to a Chinese company. The building is expected to be completed in late 2013. ""We've referred to the primary building planned for the site as One World Trade Center -- its legal name and street address -- for almost two years now, as well as using the name the Freedom Tower,"" said Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the Port Authority, in a statement released to CNN. ""Many will always refer to it as the Freedom Tower, but as the building moves out of the planning stage and into full construction and leasing, we believe that going forward it is most practical to market the building as One World Trade Center."" Ten of the building's planned 108 above-ground floors have been built. ""The fact is, more than $3 billion of public money is invested in that building, and, as a public agency, we have the responsibility to make sure it is completed and that we utilize the best strategy to make certain it is fully occupied,"" Sigmund added. He noted that the agency lost 84 colleagues in the September 11 attacks. Mary Fetchet, founding director of Voices of September 11th, a group that commemorates the lives of those killed in the attack, said she was not familiar with the decision made by the Port Authority and was not willing to make a statement. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, on the John Gambling radio show taped Friday morning, said he was not upset by the Port Authority's decision. ""It's up to the Port Authority,"" he said. ""I have no idea what the commercial aspects are, and we can say, 'Oh, we shouldn't worry about that,' but of course you have to, particularly now. ""I would like to see it stay the Freedom Tower, but it's their building, and they don't need me dumping on it. If they could rent the whole thing by changing the name, I guess they're going to do that, and they probably, from a responsible point of view, should. From a patriotic point of view, is it going to make any difference?"" He added, ""one of the things is, we call things what we want to call them. So, Avenue of the Americas is a good example, for it's Sixth Avenue to most people. Very few people use Avenue of the Americas. If they name this One World Trade Center, people will still call it the Freedom Tower."" The building was named the Freedom Tower in the first ""ground zero"" master plan. Officials said at the time that the tallest, most symbolic of five planned towers at the site would demonstrate the country's triumph over terrorism. Representatives of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Vantone Industrial Co. announced Thursday the signing of a lease that will create the China Center, a 190,810-square-foot business and cultural facility, to be on portions of the 64th floor and the entire 65th through 69th floors of One World Trade Center. Hailing it as a great day for the Port Authority and its partners in the China center, Port Authority Executive Director Chris Ward added, ""this is the first step in a long journey as downtown is finally rebuilt."" The lease is for 20 years and nine months, beginning when the building is completed, with rents starting at $80 per square foot and escalating afterward. The China Center also will have the right to lease up to two additional contiguous floors under the same terms, an option that expires at the end of 2009. The Port Authority also has commitments for more than a million square feet of leased office space in One World Trade Center from the U.S. General Services Administration and the New York State Office of General Services. Leases for these two public agencies are being finalized. These commitments, coupled with the China Center lease, represent nearly 50 percent of the office space in the building. The China Center at One World Trade Center is expected to represent the elite of China's business and cultural communities and serve as a hub for Chinese firms developing United States operations, as well as for U.S. companies that wish to conduct business in China or expand operations. One World Trade Center will include 2.6 million gross square feet of office space on 70 office floors, a public lobby with a 50-foot-high ceiling, an observation deck 1,265 feet above ground, a skyline restaurant, a wide array of shopping and parking. The building itself will be 1,368 feet tall, and a spire at the top will bring the total height to 1,776 feet. Beijing Vantone Industrial is one of the first private corporations established in China. Today, the company is one of China's largest private real estate investment companies with 13 subsidiaries, including one publicly traded company, Beijing Vantone Real Estate Co.","New skyscraper will be known as One World Trade Center .

"BOULDER, Colorado (CNN) -- Blake Jones' business plan for his company, Namaste Solar Electric, was so unusual, he confounded a lot of business experts. Typical home solar systems cost about $12,000 up front, but supporters say they pay off in the long run. ""We did have a lot of skeptical, raised eyebrows at the beginning,"" Jones said of his company, which installs solar power systems in Colorado. ""We even have had business schools bring teams of MBA students to come to do a case study,"" he said. Outsiders were baffled by some of these company plans: . • Environmental concerns would be a driving force in every aspect of the company. • Six weeks of paid time off. • A concept called FOH -- frank, open and honest -- to help eliminate gossip and grudges. • Employees, no matter what their job description, have the same pay scale. • One percent of yearly revenues goes to solar systems donated to community groups. • All major decisions would be made by consensus of all company employees. Jones had done a serious turnabout in his own career that inspired some of the unusual principles of Namaste. Namaste is a Sanskrit greeting meaning ""to bow to you."" The civil engineer spent five years working in the Middle East for Brown and Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, in the oil and gas industry. ""But something in me realized there is something more. I didn't like the overdependence that we have on oil and gas. I think oil and gas, even coal are always going to be a very big part of our lives. But I think what we need to do, is we need a more balanced portfolio. I had a gradual awakening to wanting passionately to work with renewable energy because I thought there was a better way,"" Jones said. He moved from the Middle East to Nepal, where he spent three years installing solar and hydroelectric systems in remote areas. Although the clients and the mission are very different in Colorado, solar power is becoming a more popular long-term investment in the state. Jones picked a place where residents are open to doing things a different way. Boulder is tree-hugger heaven by anyone's standards. The city has lots of incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy. ""There is more interest in solar in Boulder then anywhere else in Colorado. That's one example of how environmentally focused our community is,"" said Sarah Vanpelt, environmental sustainability coordinator for the city. In 2004, Colorado voters approved state incentives for the use of alternative energy. ""And Boulder provides a rebate on a portion of the sales and use tax that property owners pay to purchase and install a system, and we use those funds to provide grants to nonprofits to install solar on affordable housing, low-income housing, and on nonprofit facilities,"" Vanpelt said. ""So I think we will continue to see growth in the green industry and in renewable energy, both solar and wind,"" she said. Namaste is in the process of remodeling a 15,000-square-foot warehouse for its offices.  Watch more about the unique project » . And it is doing it to the highest of green building standards, the LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification. That involves everything from the use of natural light to the recycling of building materials to the access to the building by public transportation. And yes, all the building's electricity will be provided by a solar system Namaste installs. Most of the panels will be on the roof, but there will also be a solar awning. Construction manager Marc Smerekanicz did some of his own head-scratching with some of the requests to meet LEED standards. ""Thinking in a different way than what I was brought up to think of as the construction process, that's the way of the future,"" Smerekanicz said. For some customers, it is rising energy prices as much as concern for the environment that is prompting them to consider solar power for their homes and businesses. Namaste just installed solar panels on the home of Hal Stuber. ""It's become more reasonably priced, and on top of that there are the incentives from the utility company, also the federal tax credits. So, all in all, the economics really look excellent,"" Stuber said. ""For every $3 of cost, from rebates and tax credits I'm getting about $2 back, and yeah, that's a big incentive. I doubt that I would have done this had it not been for the rebates and tax incentives,"" he said. Stuber plans to use some of his solar power for a plug-in motorbike. And when his system produces more power than he uses, his electric meter runs backward. At the end of the year, he may get money back from the utility. Even with rebates, Jones said, a typical solar system costs a homeowner about $12,000 up front. But he said that as a long-term investment, it pays off. He said that's why the company's community involvement comes in the form of solar installations, not cash. ""We consider a solar system to be a gift that keeps on giving. If we give them a solar system, then it will save their electricity bills each year for the next 30 years, compared to if we just give them money, it will contribute to their budget for that one year only,"" Jones said. So how's that crazy business plan working? In the past 3½ years, Namaste has installed more solar systems than any other company in Colorado. Three original employees have grown to 45. And the company has been growing by triple-digit percentages every year. ""Whatever perspective you look at, we're being profitable, and it's exactly what we need to do to prove that our business experiment, that our company model is going to work,"" Jones said.","Businessman Blake Jones seeks to develop renewable energy sources .

"(CNN) -- Self-confessed BlackBerry addict President Barack Obama may not have to kick the thumbing habit after all, despite the concerns of a notoriously technophobic White House. Obama was a self-confessed BlackBerry addict during his White House campaign. ""The president has a BlackBerry,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday, clearing up weeks of speculation about whether President Obama would be able to hold on to a cherished method of communicating. The decision to allow Obama to keep a smartphone is ""a compromise that allows him to stay in touch with senior staff and a small group of personal friends,"" Gibbs told the media in his first press conference since the inauguration. ""Use will be limited and the security is enhanced to ensure his ability to communicate but to do so effectively,"" Gibbs also said. ""And to do so in a way that is protected."" The press secretary refused to provide more details about the new president's device, already being called the ""BarackBerry.""  Watch CNN's Errol Barnett reports on the president's new phone » . Obama was often seen hunched over the mobile e-mail cell phone device during his election campaign and even featured at No. 2 on one celebrity Web site's list of obsessive BlackBerry users. But, like previous Oval Office incumbents, Obama had been expected to take a vow of technological celibacy following his inaugural oath on Tuesday, despite telling CNBC in an interview that security officials would have to ""pry it out of my hands."" He said a mobile device would help him stay in touch with the real world. Should President Obama be allowed to keep his BlackBerry? Tell us what you think . E-mail has long been treated with suspicion by the Secret Service because of fears it could be hacked into by foreign espionage agencies, or that sensitive information could reach the public domain via a single mistaken strike of the ""send"" key. President George W. Bush was forced to give up using e-mail when he took charge, while President Bill Clinton sent just two e-mails during his administration -- one to test that the system worked and the second to veteran astronaut John Glenn before his trip into space in 1998. There are also concerns that mobile devices such as the BlackBerry, which contain built-in GPS technology, could be hacked, revealing the president's location within a few feet. But according to reports Thursday, Obama may actually have been issued a spy-proof alternative to his favorite toy. Writing on his blog for the Atlantic magazine, Marc Ambinder reports that the National Security Agency has approved a $3,350 smartphone -- inevitably dubbed the ""BarackBerry"" -- for Obama's use. The exclusive Sectera Edge, made by General Dynamics, is reportedly capable of encrypting top secret voice conversations and handling classified documents. But Obama may have pushed his Secret Service handlers' technological patience far enough. Ambinder also reports that instant messaging in the White House will still be a definite no-no. CNN's Martina Stewart contributed to this report.","Report: Security officials approve $3,350 smartphone for Barack Obama .

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- A 16-year-old girl was found dead and another girl was found unconscious in an Army barracks at Fort Lewis near Tacoma, Washington, during the weekend, a base spokesman said Monday. ""Neither of the two women had any outward signs of trauma on them,"" said Fort Lewis spokesman Joseph Piek. He said that an Army solider who was ""allegedly an acquaintance"" of the two 16-year-olds was questioned by investigators, but no arrests had been made. The spokesman said the name and rank of the soldier who had been questioned was not being released. According to an Army news release, the names of the two girls ""are not being released due to their ages, their civilian status, and the nature of the ongoing investigation."" The Fort Lewis Criminal Investigation Division is trying to determine why the two girls were in the barracks, where soldiers live, and what led to their conditions when they were found. Emergency personnel from the base responded to a 911 call about 3:30 a.m. Sunday and found the two girls in one of the barracks. A doctor declared one of the girls dead on the scene, and the second girl was transported to Madigan Army Hospital, where she was in stable condition Monday. The Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner is conducting an autopsy, Piek said, and it will be at least a week before results are complete. Both girls are from the nearby South Puget Sound area but were not related to anyone living on base, Piek said. Both girls' families had been notified, he said. Although Fort Lewis is not open to civilians, they can be escorted in by a soldier living there if they have identification and a reason for coming onto the facility. The circumstances of how the girls came unto the base are under investigation, Piek said, but there was no evidence that security had been compromised. About 30,000 military personnel are based at Fort Lewis. Barracks where soldiers live are usually split into rooms for one to three soldiers, Piek said. Details about the barracks where the girls where found were not released.","Second girl found unconscious in barracks at Fort Lewis, Washington .

"(CNN) -- Five days of gunbattles between the Indian army and separatist militants in Indian-administered Kashmir have left at least 25 dead -- eight Indian army troopers, including one officer, and 17 militants, the Indian military said Tuesday. An Indian army soldier lays a wreath during the funeral of a slain soldier, northeast of Srinagar on Tuesday. Defense Minister A.K. Antony, meeting with India's military chiefs in Delhi, reviewed the situation in the Himalayan region and told the Army to deal with the situation in the Himalayan region with ""utmost firmness."" Kashmir has been in the throes of a violent separatist campaign for nearly two decades during which authorities say 43,000 people have been killed. However, various NGOs and rights groups put the number of dead at twice the official count. In Srinigar, Kashmir, Army spokesman Lt. Col. J.S. Brar told CNN the Army was moving against the militants ""based on sound intelligence inputs as well as human intelligence provided by our own sources."" The battles in the Shamsbhari forests of north Kashmir Kupwara district have caused ""minimum collateral damage to property,"" Brar said. The spokesman denied media reports that helicopter gunships and heavy weapons had been used by the army during these operations against the militants. This month's encounter between the Indian Army and the militants is the second longest in Kashmir this year. In January, a fierce encounter raged for seven days in the Poonch district of Jammu region of Indian-administered Kashmir. Two soldiers, a policeman and four militants were killed in that encounter. Kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between India and neighboring Pakistan. Both control parts of the region which is predominantly Muslim.","NEW: 25 dead in Kashmir gunfights between Indian troops, separatist militants .

"BARCELONA, Spain (CNN) -- Google launched the latest salvo in the cellphone wars Tuesday with the unveiling of the newest handset to carry its Android platform. Google's Android platform goes head to head with Apple's iPhone. Unveiled at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Vodafone's HTC Magic smartphone will make its European bow in the UK, Spain, France and Germany in the coming months. In Italy it will be available under a non-exclusive contract. The Google-run handsets are regarded as the chief rivals to Apple's iPhones in the battle for the next generation of mobile devices. Google's latest foray into the cell phone market is seen by many as the beginnings of the Internet giant's attempts to dominate the industry. Some have expressed concerns that cell phone manufacturers, network operators and users will have little control over what data Google will be able to utilise from its software. Among critics is the LiMo Foundation, representing Linux-based operating system LiMo, which has launched its own cell phone platform, according to Congress organizer Groupe Speciale Mobile Association's daily newsletter. ""A lot of operators still harbor some questions over whether they will have the control over services and how much of the data that is going out and coming from a Google device goes to Google and how much to you [the operator],"" LiMo's Andrew Shikiar told Mobile Business Briefing. Users of both the Apple and Google models can download applications developed by third-parties from open-source software, potentially giving them the capability of small handheld computers. The first Android-capable handset, the G1, was launched last year. It partnered with T-Mobile for its UK launch, its first foray into the European market. The HTC Magic includes a 3.2-inch QVGA touch screen display, navigational buttons and a trackball. It also comes with several Google applications including Google Mail, Google Maps and Google Search as well as YouTube, which is owned by Google. Andy Rubin, Senior Director of Mobile Platforms at Google, said that the launch of the HTC Magic was an important step for Android. ""With it, Vodafone is opening up the mobile web for consumers across Europe and giving more third-party developers a platform on which they can build the next wave of killer applications,"" Rubin said. CNN's Adrian Finighan, who is at the congress, said that as an iPhone user he had spent much of his time at this year's event looking for something to rival his device. ""The Magic is, well, magic! I think I've found it. It really is the first device that I could consider swapping my beloved Apple device for.""","Vodafone's HTC Magic handset will launch in western Europe in the next few months .

"LAKE WALES, Florida (CNN) -- Does jumping out of a plane show love? For one family in Florida it does. Trevor Muir (left), 23; Darcy Shepard, 18; Harriett Shepard, 94; and Dave Shepard, 74, are ready to jump. Last Saturday, four generations of Darcy Shepard's family went skydiving for her 18th birthday. The oldest jumper was Shepard's 94-year-old great-grandmother, Harriett Shepard. Skydiving is becoming a Shepard family rite of passage. Two members of the family had jumped before -- including family matriarch Harriett. Harriett Shepard jumped three years ago, at age 91, because she wanted to know what it felt like. She is an inspiration to her great-granddaughter. ""If she can do it at 91, then I could, too,"" Darcy says, explaining that she wasn't allowed to jump three years ago because she hadn't reached age 18. As Darcy planned the adventure, her brother, cousins, father and grandfather decided to join her in skydiving. At first, the family invited 94-year-old Harriett to watch everyone skydive in central Florida. But Harriett, known to the family as ""Honeynun,"" didn't want to watch. She wanted to jump.  Watch Harriett and kin soar across the sky » . Adventure isn't new to this bunch. In the past the family has gone scuba diving and hang gliding together. Jumping out of the plane were Harriett; Darcy; Harriett's 74-year-old son Dave; Dave's 45-year-old son Dallas, who is Darcy's dad; two cousins; a girlfriend; and a future father-in-law. As she suited up, Harriett said she found it ""exciting to be doing this with the family."" The eight uncertified skydivers were trained and paired with tandem instructors at Florida Skydiving Center at the Lake Wales Airport. The center required Harriett to be cleared by a doctor prior to jumping. Florida Skydiving says Harriett Shepard is the oldest person to jump at the center. As jump time nears, Harriett is fearless. ""I'm never scared up there,"" she says. ""My husband and I had a plane. I'm never afraid.""  See photos of the family's skydiving day » . Great-grandson Trevor Muir, another of the jumpers, says he has water-skied, jumped on a trampoline and climbed giant tree forts with his great-grandmother. ""So what's skydiving? Just another notch in the pole,"" says the 23-year-old Trevor. ""We've done a lot of crazy things."" The plane, a DeHavilland Twin Otter, takes the group to an altitude of 14,000 feet. The rear door opens. Pilot Eric Weaver announces over the radio: ""Attention any traffic in the Lake Wales area. There will be skydiving over the Lake Wales Airport."" First to jump is 94-year-old Harriett, with her instructor David ""Pip"" Perry. The skydivers free-fall at speeds between 120 and 150 mph before deploying their parachute. ""Honeynun"" slowly floats to the ground, wearing her cozy buckle-up sandals that she feels are more comfortable than closed-toe shoes. After landing, Harriett -- who has battled skin cancer -- is more fearful of the sun than jumping from the plane. One skydiver after the other lands safely to fanfare from anxious family members on the ground. Eighteen-year-old Darcy is greeted with a chorus of ""Happy Birthday."" There are lots of high-fives, family photos and exclamations of ""awesome."" Darcy hugs her great-grandmom: ""Yay, Honeynun."" Darcy's father, Dallas Shepard, deems it ""an incredible jump that was a lot of fun."" Dallas says that skydiving with his grandmother was ""kind of neat, just being able to do it with her -- but she is living life, and that's the best part."" His father, Dave Shepard, calls it an experience he will remember for a long time. ""It was something special, where we had four generations."" Harriett Shepard confesses that her late husband would not be happy. ""He would have never let me do this,"" she says. ""He took care of me -- that's why I'm this old."" Yet Harriett, who has lived a long and full life as an author, photographer and architect, is concerned about the publicity. ""She's worried,"" Dave Shepard says of his mom, ""that the only thing people will remember her for is jumping out of an airplane.""","Four generations, in age from 18 to 94, jump out of plane at 14,000 feet .

"(CNN) -- Nicole Nagy had gone back to school hoping that a new career would lead to a better job. When she was turned down for financial aid, Nagy was told she could, as a song goes, ""sing for the money."" She was directed to a contest called Careereoki. Nicole Nagy enlisted the help of her children and her husband to make her videotape. Anyone brave enough to videotape themselves singing -- and sometimes dancing -- about their dream career karaoke-style was qualified to enter the competition. More than 60 videos were submitted, from which five finalists were chosen to compete for online votes that will determine the winner. Most contestants were from Central Florida, likely because the grand prize includes tuition for a certificate program at an Orange County technical school. Nagy, a mother of three, was laid off in 2007. When she couldn't find a job, her husband supported her decision to enroll in nursing school. But tuition and books are costly, and the Nagys are a month behind on the mortgage payment. So risking embarrassment, Nagy decided a better future might lie in her music video. ""I can't sing to save my life, but I will go ahead and try this because I am willing to do anything to get school paid for,"" Nagy said. Her husband, obviously a good sport, appears in the video along with her children.  Watch the contestants' videos » . Dressed in a bathrobe, she sits on the couch with her kids as her husband starts the video with the bad news, ""OK guys, I have to go to work. Sorry we can't send you to nursing school, Mom. We just don't have the money."" Nagy replies, ""Ahh man."" Addressing her children, she says, ""know what we can do instead, we can sing about it."" Nagy takes off the robe, revealing a nursing uniform and the stethoscope which acts as her microphone. Nagy then dances around her living room, belting out her tune, ""Doctor, doctor give me the news; I got a bad case of nursing blues."" She sings her original lyrics to Robert Palmer's ""Bad Case of Loving You"" as her young, obedient children wait for the song to end. Nagy's video was good enough to gain her a spot as a Careereoki finalist. But winning the contest won't be as easy as making it to the finals. The Careereoki competition is stiff. American Idol judging it was not for this first-time contest. To choose the final five videos, judges considered three categories. Points were awarded based 50 percent on the contestant's originality, 25 percent on creativity and 25 percent on the video's humor. Whether Nagy's performance will be good enough to win will depend on how many people vote for her on local radio station WPYO's Web site where the videos are posted. Fans of the musical Grease may feel inclined to vote for Julia Langston of Lake Mary, Florida. Langston does a nice job singing what is supposed to be a duet, ""Summer Nights."" She creatively sings, ""Unemployment happened so fast, never thought this recession would last."" Langston was laid off a few months ago after working for 15 years as an office manager. As with her fellow contestants, the grand prize would be a huge help for her. She is living off the money she had set aside to remodel her kitchen. Finalist Jennifer Faulk of Deltona, Florida, sums up the recurring theme of the five still standing: ""The day does not go by that I don't go online and look for something and there's just nothing out there."" The Careereoki contest was sponsored by the Orange County School Board; Workforce Central Florida, an Orlando-area job placement organization; and a local advertising agency. Workforce Vice President Kimberly Cornett said her organization's participation in the singing contest helped spread the word on their ""no-cost services"" to the community. ""It was a way to connect to job seekers, and also for job seekers to take a little break from the stress of unemployment,"" Cornett said. She said she sees that stress first hand; the Orlando organization she works for offers job placement. Unemployment in Central Florida is the highest it has been in 16 years, according to Cornett. The grand prize is worth $8,000 and includes a career training scholarship, personal and resume makeovers and a $100 gas card. Two first-place winners will also get tuition help, resume makeovers and $50 gas cards. The finalists are keeping their fingers crossed that the song in their heart doesn't end up a song sung blue. The winner will be announced on Monday.","People invited to sing for job help in ""Careereoki"" contest .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British TV channels could advertise abortion services for the first time under new advertising rules proposed Thursday by an ad industry group. The new proposals will also allow condoms to be advertised more widely on television. The Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice, the industry body responsible for writing and enforcing advertising rules in Britain, said the commercials would be for pregnancy advisory services that give information about a range of options to pregnant women, including abortion. If an organization does not offer information about abortion, it would have to make that clear in the ad, BCAP spokeswoman Lynsay Taffe said. Abortion clinics, which require referrals from doctors or hospitals, would not be allowed to advertise under the proposed rules, Taffe said. There would be no restrictions on when such ads could air on British television, she said, but programmers would have to keep the sensitive topic in mind and not schedule the ads around religious programs, for example. ""It's a sensitive product, so it would have to be scheduled sensitively,"" Taffe told CNN. The proposal is among a number of updates to current advertising standards that the Committee for Advertising Practice and BCAP, its broadcasting arm, published Thursday after an 18-month review. ""Each year the British public (sees) millions of advertisements, many of which are memorable,"" the committee said. ""The advertising codes aim to make sure that they are memorable for the right reasons."" The public now has until June 19 to comment on the proposals before they come into force, likely in 2010, the committee said. The new proposals also contain a change on advertising condoms on television. Under current rules, condoms generally cannot be advertised on TV before 9 p.m. in order to protect younger viewers, the committee said. New rules would relax the restrictions on advertising condoms, with the only requirement that they not be shown around programs intended for children younger than 10. The change came after Joyce Gould, a member of the House of Lords, requested the change and noted that Britain had the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Europe along with spiraling rates of sexually transmitted diseases, the committee said. Gould reported a survey that showed young people believed TV was one of the most effective ways of encouraging them to use condoms. ""The presence of condom advertisements on television continues to be a subject of complaint to the (Advertising Standards Authority), but numbers are very low,"" the committee said. ""Nevertheless, BCAP has to balance public sensitivities against a public health problem that is clearly urgent.""","British TV channels could advertise abortion services under new proposals .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- France is sending four state police units to its overseas department of Guadeloupe after a month of sometimes violent demonstrations, Interior Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said Thursday. French gendarmes face-off against Guadeloupe protesters. ""The pillaging ... the violence against people, are not tolerable and will not be tolerated,"" Alliot-Marie told the French radio station RTL. ""It's no longer simply a question of containing the protests. ... This mission of honor will continue to be undertaken, but we also have to fight against the violence."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy planned to meet with elected officials from overseas departments, including Guadeloupe, Thursday afternoon, his office announced. A general strike over low wages and living conditions in the Caribbean island has included demonstrations and clashes with police. At least one civilian has been killed in the riots, officials said. Hospitals and emergency services continue to function and the main international airport is open, but petrol stations, schools, and most businesses -- including supermarkets and car rental offices -- are closed, the British Foreign Office said in a travel advisory. Hotels are open, but the strike is causing daily cuts to electricity and water supplies, the Foreign Office said. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said Thursday he is ready to approve a compromise that would give nearly a €200 ($254) monthly supplement to workers in Guadeloupe with low-paying jobs. ""This crisis is serious, and profound, but it's not new,"" Fillon said, adding that it's linked to ""the lifelessness of the economy in the Antilles, aggravated by the global economic crisis."" Sending supplementary police forces is justified, Fillon said, because ""we cannot accept what has happened"" in the department. He was referring to the attacks on businesses, the roadblocks in the streets and above all, the death of the civilian, who he said was a union leader. Agence France-Presse identified the victim as union representative Jacques Bino. He was shot dead Tuesday night when he drove past a roadblock manned by armed youths in the city of Pointe-a-Pitre. His car was hit three times by shotgun fire, prosecutors told AFP. Three police who accompanied emergency services trying to help the dying man were lightly wounded, officials said, according to AFP. Speaking with RTL on Wednesday, one demonstrator denied he was fanning the flames of unrest. ""We have always called for calm,"" Elie Domota, leader of the Coalition against Exploitation, said. ""We have told the young people to go to their homes and continue to protest peacefully, but the police yesterday beat protesters and called them racist names, so the situation escalated.""

"(CNN) -- What he lacks in technique, Steve Wozniak makes up for in geeks. Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak and his partner show off their moves on ""Dancing With the Stars."" The Apple Inc. co-founder has managed to transform his less-than-graceful moves on ABC's ""Dancing With the Stars"" into enough votes to keep hope alive on the competitive ballroom-dance show. ""Woz,"" as he is known by friends and fans alike, and partner Katarina Smirnoff have had some of the lowest scores from the trio of judges since the show premiered on March 9. But the judges, who are experts in the field of competitive dance, aren't the only deciding factor. Viewers can vote online, via phone calls or by text messaging, and those votes comprise 50 percent of each couple's score. The dance team with the lowest combined score is then voted off the show -- a fate that may await Wozniak on Tuesday night. Wozniak and Smirnoff are up against a bevy of entertainers, including an Olympian, an NFL Hall of Famer, the most successful female rapper in hip-hop history and an actor whose claim to fame is appearing naked in the film ""Sex and the City."" But all that star power has so far been matched by the power of computer geeks who are using what they know best to keep the rhythmically challenged Silicon Valley icon in the game. Chris Harrington, technology director for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based advertising, public relations and new media firm Luquire George Andrews, set up VoteWoz.com and a similarly named Twitter account, which so far has more than 55,000 followers. Harrington -- who began rallying the techie troops almost as soon as ABC announced that Wozniak would be competing -- said he is rooting for the philanthropist because ""he puts more heart and more passion in what he's doing than some of the other dancers."" ""When you have beautiful athletes, movie stars and TV personalities, and then you mix in a geek, there's something a little strange and entertaining,"" Harrington said. ""Being a fellow geek myself, I thought now is the time to work with the technologies that we know and start pushing for the vote."" That means lots and lots of social networking to spread the love -- and the word of Woz. Joe Patane is a longtime friend of Wozniak's and one of the officers for the official ""Vote for Woz on ABC's 'Dancing With the Stars' "" Facebook group. Patane shares his friend's passion for philanthropy and runs his own foundation and the site joesworld.org. He also knows a bit about reality television. A former cast member of MTV's ""The Real World: Miami,"" Patane was instrumental in convincing his bud to sign on to the show and said the lovable (though some might argue lumbering) Wozniak has garnered fans both young and old. ""He loves his fans, and he's completely flattered by the fan response,"" Patane said. ""He's a shy guy, and he's doing a crazy, unique and different thing in his life that he wants to share with the world."" Patane, who is also executive producer of the documentary ""Camp Woz: The Admirable Lunacy of Philanthropy,"" said he enjoys watching his friend dance each week. ""He's the most uniquely giving, loving, happy man,"" Patane said. ""With so many people watching this show, it's a good, infectious way to spread love, joy and hope."" Aaron Petrey of Stanford, Kentucky, is one viewer who has fully embraced the Wozniak mania. He won an autographed copy of the book ""iWoz"" for submitting a video of himself imitating Wozniak's dance moves to VoteWoz.com. Petrey said it's only natural that fans of Woz would turn to the Internet to support him. ""Without [Wozniak] there probably wouldn't be a YouTube, Twitter or Facebook,"" Petrey said. ""He's the reason why we even have a computer. I like seeing him on the show."" Unfortunately, the ""Dancing With the Stars"" judges don't seem to feel the same way. Despite dancing through injuries -- including a pulled hamstring that sent him to the hospital in an ambulance last week -- Wozniak failed to impress the experts Monday night. While he did manage to score a perfect 10, it was a collective 10 out of a possible 30. At one point during Wozniak's and Smirnoff's samba, judge Bruno Tonioli put his face in his hands. Wozniak capped their routine by doing his version of the break-dance move known as ""the worm,"" but even that failed to save his lackluster performance. ""At some point the novelty wears off,"" said judge Carrie Ann Inaba, often cited as the kindest of the three. Wozniak, who beat out former Go-Go's lead singer Belinda Carlisle after a dance-off in an earlier round, kept his smile throughout the storm of criticism. ""I enjoy it,"" he said on the show afterward. ""I'm going to try to bring my form of entertainment to the world.""","Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak scores this season on ""Dancing With the Stars""

"(CNN) -- Despite the steady drum-beat of economic news, therapists say money is still one of the most taboo subjects for American families. Keli Lauric, 30, and her grandmother, Evelyn Gloer, 79, view money based on life experience. ""It's easier to talk about sex than it is to talk about money in our societies,"" says Dr. Nancy Molitor, a psychologist in Illinois. And that's too bad, because all of us have something to learn from each other, says Molitor. Often, generations seem like they're speaking different languages when it comes to saving and spending money. Older people tend to save, while younger generations wrestle with the fallout from overspending.   Experts say people's spending habits often reflect the environment in which they grew up. To find out how families view money during the economic recession, CNN.com sat down with two multigenerational families. The four-generation Merriweather family worries its younger members may have been spoiled by the economic high tide of the 1990s and early 2000s. Marvin Merriweather, 65, says a person's spending habits are derived from life experience. If your life was hard, you save; if you've got it made, you tend to spend, he says.  Watch the Merriweather family talk about money » . ""I think a lot of the fault falls to us as the older generation by not teaching [financial skills], because we try so hard to make it better for our children."" The three-generation Gloer family says families need to remember to lean on each other during the hard times. ""Life's what you make it. I still say that,"" says Evelyn Gloer, 79. ""I mean, you don't have to be rich to have a happy home."" Olivia Mellon, a money coach who organizes multigenerational family retreats to talk about spending, says older generations are more inclined to hoard money because they've lived through difficult times. Now, ""we have a culture of addictive overspenders,"" she says. But, with the recession, there are signs spending habits are trending back toward the Depression era, she says. ""Some people are getting much more frugal and much more risk-averse,"" Mellon says. Keli Lauric, Gloer's 30-year-old granddaughter, says she spent her money freely in her 20s, living in New York. Now in Atlanta, Georgia, she owns two houses because she can't find a way to sell or rent one of them. Like many people, she's had to cut back. The recession has ""made everyone realize you have to live on a budget all the time, even when times are good,"" she said. Dr. April Benson, a psychologist and author of books on compulsive spending, said this is a good time for families to bond over experiences instead of purchases. Molitor, the family therapist, said many Baby Boomers grew up with a sense of entitlement about money. Now, many of them are terrified because they may have to put off retirement because their savings accounts dwindled as markets fell. Older generations tend to save more, she said. Many avoid credit because they remember hard times after the Great Depression. iReport.com: What have you learned from past generations? Families can use the economic recession as a chance to band together and learn from each other, she says. ""This is an opportunity. As much as this is very painful, many people are actually using this as a challenge and they're actually rising above this,"" she says. Molitor said children should be involved in financial planning from an early age. At about age 8, they should be able to understand if the family is under financial stress, so it's best to see what they can contribute. Dr. Barbara Lips, on the other hand, says children should be involved in financial planning, but should not be made aware of family money problems at a young age. ""If [children] have a sense that mom and dad are OK then they are OK,"" says Lips, a psychologist in Iowa. ""Mom and dad being OK really is their sense of security."" Molitor says she's seen a wave of families come to her to talk about money and the stress it's causing them. Often, what they need is to talk to each other, says Molitor. The Gloer family agrees. Melanie Burns, Evelyn's 53-year-old daughter, says families should band together in hard times.   ""That's what family's for ... We're here to support each other if we need it."" ""Right, when somebody falls down we pick them up,"" Evelyn Gloer responded.","Therapists say money is still more taboo in American families than sex .

"(CNN) -- The moment I saw that guinea pig's corpse, I made up my mind. I would not tell my son Checkers was dead ... at least not that night. Drew had five tests within the next two days. I wasn't going to let grief jeopardize his grades. Checkers, on the left, enjoys a bit of kale with Andrea. I realize instantly the challenges of my decision. How could I keep this secret in a 10-by-12 room in which the guinea pig chalet was almost as big as the twin bed? I'd already goofed by yelping, ""Oh, my!"" when I saw the body. Drew heard me from his bathroom. ""What's wrong, Mommy? Are you OK?"" ""I'm fine,"" I reply. But he recognizes that I haven't answered both questions. ""But what's wrong?"" ""Nothing."" ""Well, why did you say that? Is it the guinea pigs?"" I feel panicked. No sloshing! He's drying off! Pajamas are next! I realize I'm holding my breath, and in my head, I'm yelling, ""Move, Christy! Move!"" I exhale as I lie. ""Everything's OK."" In what seemed like one move, I reach in the closet, dump shoes out of a box, grab Checkers, plunk the stiff in the box, run downstairs, stuff the cardboard casket into a plastic bag, dash to the garage trash can, finish rapid hand-washing and make it upstairs as my third-grader steps into the hall. ""We're having storytime in my bed tonight!"" I say breathlessly. My bed is off-limits except for nightmares, illness or Saturday morning. Drew's so excited about the treat, he runs for the king-sized sanctum without asking questions. We read and pray, and then I give him a piggyback ride into his dark bedroom. It's Wednesday, 7:45 p.m., and for now, I'm in the clear. By the time Drew wakes the next morning, I have a plan: darkness and distraction. We're always 30 minutes into our commute before the sun rises. Between a disabled circuit breaker to prevent lights in his room from working, piggyback rides up and down the stairs, dressing in mom's room (where the lights work) while we review potential bonus words, multiplication drills, Scripture recitation for the Bible test, questions science and reading lessons, there are enough morning distractions to safeguard my secret. Thursday evening is a challenge. In our house, TV is for weekends only. It's cold and drizzly outside; Andrew has beaten me in chess -- twice. I pull out the biggest distraction of all. ""I'm going to let you see a video tonight. You need to relax a bit from those tests today,"" I say. His eyebrows make a big V on his forehead. ""But it's a school night, Mommy."" I assure him it's OK. He's suspicious, but TV is as awesome as getting in Mom's bed, so no more questions. My co-workers split into camps. The Grief Gurus ream me for concealing the death. Andrew loves Checkers. He deserves timely notice of death. I care more about grades than his emotional health. Bad things will happen to Drew at inopportune times in his life, and he has to learn to juggle difficulties. I'm delaying his development. Whatever. The Practical Posse has opinions, too. That guinea pig still will be dead Friday. Andrew will be just as sad after his tests with fewer consequences than if he's sad before the tests. Make sure you're honest about why you delayed telling him. After school Friday, I break the news. There's a shriek and then loads of tears. I'll never forget the long drawn-out wail, ""I loved her like a daughter!"" I'm convinced that boy's been reading William Faulkner, because there is way too much drama that follows. We must wear black for three days. The only song we can listen to on the ""High School Musical 2"" CD is the duet after Gabriella and Troy break up. It's the saddest one. He cancels Happy Meal Friday, because there is nothing happy about this day. I answer the questions. She was on her side at the end of the ramp. Her mouth was open with her two big teeth protruding. No, it didn't look like she suffered. Maybe a lung problem killed her. I think Andrea (the cage mate) will be fine. No, it wasn't your care that killed her. And then finally, ""She died Wednesday."" Tears stop. Voice strengthens. ""Wednesday?!"" ""Honey, you had a science test. You needed to know your binominal nomenclature. You had a math unit test, a reading test. You had to do your scripture recitation and a Bible test. You see how upset you are now? I couldn't let you go to school and take tests feeling like this."" There's a long pause. And then he says the words that make giving piggyback rides on a spine with bad discs and disabling circuit breakers worth it. He stares deeply and says, ""Thank you, Mommy."" Maybe the Grief Gurus are right. Maybe Drew deserved to know sooner. But he seems fine. I'm certain he'll develop into a man who can handle more than one problem at a time. And Checkers, rest in peace.","Mom discovers young boy's guinea pig has died suddenly .

"(CNN) -- A roadside bomb attack Thursday in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, injured the nation's interior minister and killed one of his secretaries, according to a source close to the minister. The Bakaraha market in Somalia's capital is one of the most dangerous areas of the city. The mid-day attack on Abdukadir Ali Omar, a member of the transitional government, left him with shrapnel wounds to his leg. The extent of his injuries was unclear, said the source, who requested anonymity because he is not allowed to speak to the media. The explosion occurred about noon at the Bakaraha market, in one of the most dangerous areas of the city. The interior minister is a popular moderate who led assaults against Ethiopian forces during their invasion of Somalia. Ethiopian troops invaded the country at its request in December 2006. The Ethiopian invasion ousted the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamic movement that had claimed control of Mogadishu earlier that year. Thursday's attack on Ali Omar fueled concerns that moderate Islamists would strike out against the hardline Al-Shabab, which is suspected in the explosion. Al-Shabab -- which the United States has designated a terror organization -- warmly welcomed a recent call for the overthrow of Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, Somalia's new president. The call, delivered via an audio recording, purportedly came from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. -- Journalist Mohamed Amin Adow contributed to this report.","Attack on Abdukadir Ali Omar left him with shrapnel wounds to his leg .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The Israeli military's firing of white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas during the Gaza offensive ""was indiscriminate and is evidence of war crimes,"" Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report on Wednesday. Human Rights Watch says Israel used white phosphorus shells over populated areas in Gaza. ""In Gaza, the Israeli military didn't just use white phosphorus in open areas as a screen for its troops,"" said Fred Abrahams, a HRW senior emergencies researcher. ""It fired white phosphorus repeatedly over densely populated areas, even when its troops weren't in the area and safer smoke shells were available. As a result, civilians needlessly suffered and died."" Entitled ""Rain of Fire: Israel's Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza,"" the 71-page report provides ""witness accounts"" and ""presents ballistics evidence, photographs, and satellite imagery, as well as documents from the Israeli military and government."" HRW is an independent international organization dedicated to defending and protecting human rights. The group urged Israel and the United States to investigate the attacks. Israel should prosecute those who carried them out and the U.S. government, which supplied Israel, should look into the issue. HRW said white phosphorous was a chemical substance dispersed in artillery shells, bombs and rockets, used primarily to obscure military operations. ""(While) it is not considered a chemical weapon and is not banned per se, it ignites and burns on contact with oxygen and creates a smokescreen at night or during the day to mask the visual movement of troops. ""It also interferes with infra-red optics and weapon-tracking systems, thus protecting military forces from guided weapons such as anti-tank missiles. When WP comes into contact with people or objects, though, it creates an intense and persistent burn. It can also be used as a weapon against military targets,"" the group said. In response, the Israeli military said ""smoke shells are not an incendiary weapon"" and defended its actions. The Israel Defense Forces said it was close to completing its probe into ""the use of ammunition containing elements of phosphorous."" ""(The invesitgation) is dealing with the use of ammunition containing elements of phosphorous, including, among others, the 155mm smoke shells which were referred to in the HRW report. This type of ammunition disperses in the atmosphere and creates an effective smoke screen. It is used by many Western armies. ""It is already possible to conclude that the IDF's use of smoke shells was in accordance with international law. These shells were used for specific operational needs only and in accord with international humanitarian law. The claim that smoke shells were used indiscriminately, or to threaten the civilian population, is baseless,"" the IDF said. It said  ""that weapons intended for screening are not classed as incendiary weapons."" But Abrahams said past IDF investigations into allegations of wrongdoing suggest their inquiry would be neither thorough nor impartial. ""That's why an international investigation is required into serious laws of war violations by all parties. ""For the needless civilian deaths caused by white phosphorus, senior commanders should be held to account,"" Abrahams said. The report said white phosphorus munitions weren't illegal when deployed properly in open areas, but it determined that the IDF repeatedly used them ""unlawfully over populated neighborhoods, killing and wounding civilians and damaging civilian structures, including a school, a market, a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital. "" ""First, the repeated use of air-burst white phosphorus in populated areas until the last days of the operation reveals a pattern or policy of conduct rather than incidental or accidental usage. Second, the IDF was well aware of the effects of white phosphorus and the dangers it poses to civilians. Third, the IDF failed to use safer available alternatives for smokescreens,"" the report said. A medical report prepared during the recent hostilities by the Israeli Health Ministry said that white phosphorus ""can cause serious injury and death when it comes into contact with the skin, is inhaled or is swallowed."" The report said that the IDF could have used a non-lethal smoke shells produced by an Israeli company if it wanted to provide a ""smokescreen"" for its troops. Israel launched the offensive in late December to take on militants from Hamas, who had been shelling southern Israeli communities for months from Gaza. The offensive, called Operation Cast Lead, was launched December 27 and ended January 17 with a cease-fire. Of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict, 1,440 were Palestinian, including 431 children and 114 women, a U.N. report recently said. The 13 Israelis killed included three civilians and six soldiers killed by Hamas, and four soldiers killed by friendly fire, it said. HRW also said it found no evidence that the Hamas militants Israel was targeting in Gaza were using human shields ""in the vicinity at the time of the attacks."" Israel has said Hamas militants used civilians as human shields and fought from civilian locations, HRW points out. ""In some areas Palestinian fighters appear to have been present, but this does not justify the indiscriminate use of white phosphorus in a populated area.""","Israel's use of phosphorus shells over during Gaza offensive ""indiscriminate""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Protesters draped themselves in the colorful flag of Tibet and shouted slogans at the Chinese embassy in London on Saturday at the start of a demonstration to mark the 50th anniversary since the Tibetan uprising against China. Protesters have gathered in London to mark the 50th anniversary of the Tibet uprising. ""Tibetans in Tibet -- we are with you!"" they shouted. ""China, China, China -- out, out, out!"" The small but fervent group marched from the embassy through west London to Trafalgar Square, where they were due to hear a speech by Thomas Shao Jiang, a Chinese dissident who was one of the student organizers of the Tiananmen Square protest in Beijing in 1989. ""I think it's important that Tibet is kept in the world's eye,"" protester Chris Last told CNN amid placards declaring ""50 years too long"" and ""We are Tibetans, not Chinese."" While Tibet is technically autonomous from the central Chinese government, its current government is directed from Beijing. The Dalai Lama, traditionally the spiritual and political leader of the Tibetan Buddhists, lives in exile in India. Tuesday marks the 50th anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against Beijing's rule that sent the Dalai Lama into exile. Protest organizers said the march was meant to draw public attention to what they say is a deepening crisis a year after China cracked down on protests across Tibet. ""(British Prime Minister) Gordon Brown and other world leaders must respond urgently and publicly to the Tibet crisis by taking immediate action,"" said Stephanie Brigden, director of Free Tibet. ""They should demand that China calls off its security stranglehold in Tibet as an essential first step towards backing the Dalai Lama's initiative in finding a long-term and negotiated settlement to China's occupation."" Tibetan Buddhists say they resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in China. That resentment spilled over last March, when Buddhist monks initiated peaceful anti-Chinese protests in the regional capital, Lhasa, on the 49th anniversary of the uprising. The protests soon turned violent, with demonstrators burning vehicles and shops. Some protesters advocated independence from China, while others demonstrated against the growing influence of the Han Chinese in the area and other regions of China with ethnic Tibetan populations. The subsequent crackdown left 18 civilians and one police officer dead, according to the Chinese government. Tibet's self-proclaimed government-in-exile put the death toll from the protests at 140. China accuses the Dalai Lama of fomenting the discord in his homeland -- a charge he denies. ""The Dalai Lama demanded the establishment of the so-called 'Greater Tibetan area' on a quarter of the Chinese territory, to drive away Chinese army stationed there guarding the Chinese territory, and to drive away Chinese people of other ethnic groups who lived there for generations. Is such a person a religious figure?"" Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said Saturday. ""The conflict between him and us is not religious conflict, human rights conflict, ethnic conflict, nor cultural conflict,"" Yang said. ""The conflict is whether or not to maintain China's unification, and whether or not to permit Tibet to be separated from the Chinese territory."" The Dalai Lama has said he does not advocate violence or a separate and independent Tibet. He has said he wants a genuine autonomy that preserves the cultural heritage of the region. ""I'm just disgusted with the way the Chinese behave towards the Tibetans. Even if you accept that Tibet has been swallowed up by China, why can't they give to them autonomy, respect their religion, their culture?"" protester Bob Hunt said Saturday. ""These are peaceable people, one of the most peaceable people in the world."" Protester Shobha Trivedi said she hoped the protest march would make people more aware of the situation inside Tibet. ""I feel as a human being, what (the) Chinese are doing for 50 years, nobody's bothering with it,"" she said. ""And it's a real shame on everyone.""","London protesters marking 50th anniversary of Tibetan uprising against China .

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- More than 200 people have died of meningitis in the past week alone in Niger and Nigeria, according to the World Health Organization. A health care worker vaccinates a child during an earlier outbreak of meningitis in Niger. The disease is an epidemic in 76 areas of the two countries, the health agency reported Wednesday. A spokesman for W.H.O. in Nigeria, Dr. Olaokun Soyinka, said Saturday that the outbreak is bigger than usual and stretches across the African meningitis belt from east- to west-sub-Saharan Africa. The outbreak began around the start of the year, Soyinka told CNN. It usually peaks in the dry season because of dust, winds and cold nights, before dipping around May when the rains come, he said. A shortage of vaccines means officials are relying on ""effective prevention,"" in which they watch for outbreaks and then vaccinate people in the epicenter and surrounding areas, Soyinka told CNN. There have been nearly 25,000 suspected cases and more than 1,500 deaths in the meningitis belt in the first 11 weeks of the year, W.H.O. reported. More than 85 percent of those cases happened in northern Nigeria and Niger. Nigeria's Ministry of Health has reported 17,462 suspected cases of meningococcal disease, including 960 deaths, the world health agency said. In the past week, it reported 4,164 suspected cases with 171 deaths. Sixty-six local government areas in Nigeria have crossed the epidemic threshold. Epidemic thresholds are a way the W.H.O. confirms the emergence of an epidemic so it can step up vaccinations and other management measures. Niger's Ministry of Health has reported 4,513 suspected cases of meningococcal disease, including 169 deaths, since the start of the year. In the past week, 1,071 suspected cases and 30 deaths have been reported, the W.H.O. said. Ten of Niger's 42 districts have crossed the epidemic threshold. By comparison, other countries are reporting fewer than 50 cases a week. Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord. Several different bacteria can cause meningitis but Neisseria meningitidis -- which is to blame for this outbreak -- is one of the most significant because of its potential to cause epidemics. Health authorities have released 2.3 million doses of vaccine to Nigeria and 1.9 million doses to Niger, the W.H.O. said. CNN's Christian Purefoy in Lagos, Nigeria, contributed to this report.","W.H.O.: Meningitis killed more than 200 people in the past week in Niger and Nigeria .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The numbers were good for ""Knowing."" In ""Knowing,"" a physics professor (Nicolas Cage) ponders patterns in a list of numbers. The film, about a physics professor who sees clues for disastrous events in a time capsule's list of digits, overcame some pretty long odds at the box office -- going against the Paul Rudd-Jason Segel comedy ""I Love You, Man,"" the Julia Roberts-Clive Owen romantic thriller ""Duplicity"" and some fairly scathing reviews -- to emerge as the weekend's No. 1 film. Though star Nicolas Cage wouldn't have predicted the outcome, in an interview before the film's release, he did talk about the power of positive thinking. ""I'm a huge believer of the human spirit,"" he told CNN. ""I think people are amazing. I think what we have accomplished is incredible. ... If you think positive and you apply the guts and ingenuity that mankind has been doing forever, at least in our existence, I believe we get through anything."" Cage's character, John Koestler, is a science professor whom Cage describes as ""someone who is reawakening to his faith."" He begins the film believing that everything is random, but as the film continues -- and he seeks to alert the world of a coming catastrophe -- ""he believes there is cause and effect and perhaps even a divine mind,"" Cage said. The film begins in 1959, with students burying items in a time capsule at an elementary school. One of the children, however, creates an image of seemingly random numbers. Fifty years later, when the capsule is opened, Koestler's son receives the page of numbers, and his father realizes that they correspond to major disasters of the past half-century. Koestler determines that three events have yet to occur and sets out to meet the clairvoyant child's now grown daughter. The final event threatens life on Earth itself, and the group begins a race against time, with unusual consequences. Critics were not impressed. The film earned a 25 percent rating on the review aggregator RottenTomatoes.com, with some reviewers in full-on mockery mode.  Watch Mr. Moviefone review ""Knowing"" and other films » . ""It's increasingly hard to believe that Cage won an Oscar in 1996 (for 'Leaving Las Vegas'),"" wrote USA Today's Claudia Puig in a 1½-star review. ""In the past decade, he has made some awful choices, and his range has seemed to grow more limited."" ""It's so inept that you may wish you were watching an M. Night Shyamalan version of the very same premise,"" wrote Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman, referring to the director whose last two films, ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening,"" were two of the most detested films of recent years. But the film's apocalyptic theme obviously strikes a chord, something director Alex Proyas (""Dark City"") saw early on. Proyas told CNN in a pre-release interview that ""you can read [the film] as biblical if you choose to,"" but he prefers to see it as ""spiritual."" ""I try to leave it very open-ended,"" he said. ""I try to think of it as more a spiritual place than a biblical one."" Cage's character, he said, is on a spiritual quest in the midst of what could be global destruction. Rose Byrne, who plays the clairvoyant child's daughter, Diana, called the film ""kind of a theological discussion."" ""That's always an exciting topic,"" she said. ""It's bridging the gap between science and spirituality. That always makes things thought-provoking, and I like that with any piece of art."" Byrne said that ""Knowing"" taps into some of the end-times anxiety that's been in the air in recent years, which perhaps could help find an audience. (As she was talking before the film's release, she didn't realize how much of an audience.) ""I think it's a common thing in life,"" she said of end-of-the-world fears, referencing one of the latest making the rounds -- the Mayan calendar's Long Count end in 2012 -- in making her point. Proyas observes that given such worries, the film can be a wake-up call for such concerns as global climate change. ""There is a symbolic aspect to what is happening and what the story is about, and to get people to pay attention to what could happen,"" he said. But, he adds, it's also just a movie. ""I believe in the entertainment value of movies -- very much so,"" he said. ""I ... want to make it good for the audience. I really want people to be there and experience something powerful and resident, both in terms of ideas and emotions ... and also with this film trying to do something different. It's a challenging film, and it takes some unexpected turns.""","""Knowing"" was weekend's No. 1 film .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Islamic parties in Indonesia will not get enough votes in the coming election to nominate a presidential candidate, according to polls, analysts and an Islamic party official. Supporters of Indonesia's Democratic Party of Struggle take part in a campaign event in Jakarta on March 24. Nevertheless, the influence of Islam on politics in Indonesia -- the world's most populous Muslim country -- has many nationalist parties changing their strategy. The April 9 national elections will determine the makeup of Indonesia's 550-seat parliament, as well as its regional representation council, provincial, county and city assemblies. More than 38 parties are vying for these seats, but very few are expected to get the 20 percent of parliamentary seats needed to nominate a presidential candidate in the July election. In fact, the only party expected to meet the 20 percent threshold is President Susilo Bambang Yudyohono's Democratic Party. Other parties will have to join alliances to nominate a president. Yudyohono's ""charming"" personality, and his government's ability to weather the current worldwide financial downturn, have kept him on top of the polls, according to James Castle, who analyzes Indonesian politics and economy. Castle said despite the influence of Islam on Indonesian politics, voters are more concerned about economic issues. ""Like everywhere in the world, economics is the key factor,"" he said. ""It's quite clear from all these surveys, when inflation was high, the president's popularity is low. Now that inflation has come down, the president's popularity is high, and he and his party are doing very well in the polls coming into the election."" So far, Indonesia has not felt the impact of the global recession, partly because its economy is more isolated than other countries'. But the government has taken steps to protect the currency and the economy from the downturn, Castle said. ""This will probably just be a speed bump for Indonesia,"" he said. Although financial issues are the main concern for voters in Indonesia -- where poverty is rampant -- Yudyohono's Democratic Party has recently had to bow to pressure from Islamic groups. Andi Mallarangang, a spokesman for the president, acknowledged that the party's support for an anti-pornography bill -- which was passed in October -- was a ""symbolic gesture"" to the Islamic groups that had called for the measure. ""During the process of legislation, (the government) made sure we do not support pornography,"" Mallarangang said. ""But there should be no limitation on freedom of arts and expression"" He noted that the final law was not as strong as the initially proposed bill. Another issue that has made headlines in the Indonesian media is the government's position on Ahmadiyah, a Muslim sect that does not believe Mohammad is the last prophet. The government recently restricted the freedoms of the group, but has so far refused to ban the group. ""In Indonesia, one group of Islamic radicals would like the government to ban Ahmadiyah ... so the government's using the middle approach in which we will not ban Ahmadiyah because they have a right,"" Mallarangang said. ""But there are certain things that are sensitive to (their) operation that are regulated by government."" One of those groups that has been outspoken in its rejection of Ahmadiyah is Indonesia's Ulama Council. The chairman of the council, Amidhan, disputed media reports that the council has given Yudyohono's government a deadline to ban the sect or it will issue an edict against voting for Yudyohono. Amidhan -- who goes by one name -- said the council's fatwa against Ahmadiyah was first issued in 1980, but it had to reissue the edict last year because of complaints that the sect was trying to convert other Muslims. ""We agree Ahmadiyah must be a new religion, not part of Islam,"" Amidhan said. The council is an independent organization, but remains very influential. In January, it issued several new fatwas -- including bans on smoking for children and pregnant women, and chanting during yoga. A fatwa is a legal pronouncement for Muslims, but the council said it has no authority to enforce them. Indonesia's Islamic parties are also adopting more moderate positions to attract more voters, which has caused internal divisions -- particularly for PKS, translated as the Prosperous Justice Party. PKS legislator Zulkieflimansyah, known as Bang Zul, said the party ""is between a rock and a hard place."" ""We have to behave like a political party and also an Islamic movement,"" he said. That has led to a split between the hard-liners and the moderates in the PKS. ""We are using the elections as a test,"" Bang Zul said. ""Hopefully, if we are able to convince the public, PKS will continue to be a significant player in politics."" Another Islamic party, the National Awakening Party, or PKB, said it intends to use the 2009 election to position itself for the next election in five years. ""All parties want to reach the 20 percent threshold (to nominate a presidential candidate), PKB included,"" said the party's vice secretary-general, Helmy Faishal Zaini. ""But realistically almost no party will be able to nominate on its own."" That does not mean that a small party like PKB cannot succeed, he said. Zaini said PKB hopes it can put forward a vice presidential candidate who could possibly run for the top spot in the 2014 election. ""We need to build a foundation now,"" he said. ""So one way to do this is to join one of the senior people (politicians) with a junior person this time. ... ""2009 could be the beginning of the new generation"" of politicians.","April 9 elections will determine the makeup of Indonesia's 550-seat parliament .

"(CNN) -- As Iraqi officials speak loftily of ethnic and political reconciliation, Abu Wissam seethes. In April 2006, two Iraqis mourn a relative slain in sectarian violence in the city of Falluja. He wants cold, hard justice for the killers of his son, Raed, a 25-year-old business school graduate, ""cut to pieces"" by Mehdi Army militia members in their Baghdad neighborhood. The Wissams are among the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis caught in the maelstrom of the militia violence that rippled across Iraq after the 2006 bombing in Samarra of the Askariya Mosque, a Shiite shrine. The kind of trauma and pain endured by the Wissam family is kindling an interest in a social healing process adopted by countries around the world -- truth commissions. They are bodies across the globe that have provided a forum for victims and perpetrators to give cathartic public testimony on human rights abuses and come up with policy recommendations to correct the root cause of the abuses. ""Iraq, like many Arab cultures, is an intensely rich narrative culture,"" said Miranda Sissons, Iraq director of the International Center for Transitional Justice, which helps countries pursuing accountability for past mass atrocities and human rights abuses. ""The idea of standing up and witnessing is tremendously appealing, the kind of act and mechanism they can understand.""  Watch how the ""business of death"" continues to thrive » . The U.S. Institute of Peace -- one of the independent agencies behind the all-important Iraq Study Group report in 2006 -- is backing an initiative in Iraq to generate understanding and ""spark public dialogue on the usefulness of the truth commission process."" The institute is teaming up with Iraq's Ministry of Human Rights to screen a USIP film across Iraq about the work of four different commissions. Called ""Confronting The Truth: Truth Commissions and Societies in Transition,"" the film -- produced by York Zimmerman and Peter Ackerman -- explores the workings of such commissions in South Africa, Peru, Morocco and East Timor. The film is getting some good reviews among Iraqis. ""The truth commission process is one in which you encourage folks to directly confront that past and how to get behind it,"" said Sermid Al-Sarraf, the executive director of the International Institute for the Rule of Law, a group that manages USIP's rule of law programs in Iraq. Truth commissions and other conflict-resolution strategies have been on Iraq's radar for years. Oral history projects have emerged, one being the Iraq History Project -- which ""gathers and analyzes personal narratives from victims, their families, witnesses, perpetrators and others"" about the ""torture, massacres, assassinations, rape, chemical weapons attacks, disappearances, and other acts of systematic repression"" during the Saddam Hussein regime. That project is managed by the International Human Rights Law Institute of DePaul University College of Law in Chicago and is run by an all-Iraqi in-country staff. Last year, Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari's Crisis Management Initiative and a conflict-resolution initiative at the University of Massachusetts Boston were behind an effort to forge the so-called Helsinki agreement -- a statement of reconciliation principles among a wide range of Iraqi politicians. That process was notable because former antagonists in Northern Ireland and South Africa worked with the Iraqis. Padraig O'Malley, a UMass conflict-resolution professor involved in the Helsinki process, is planning a three-day forum in April for ""divided cities,"" where officials from ethnically tense Kirkuk in Iraq will discuss common problems with officials from Derry/Londonderry and Belfast in Northern Ireland, Nicosia in Cyprus, and Mitrovica in Kosovo. The International Center for Transitional Justice says Coalition Provisional Authority officials initially proposed a ""truth-seeking commission"" for Iraq in 2003 but eventually decided to ""delay the process"" in order for Iraqis to rigorously study other truth-telling efforts, as advocated by the center. In 2005, the center also discussed the establishment of a center for the missing and disappeared. As for truth commissions today, some observers say there hasn't been the political will on the part of the national government to pursue one. So says Joost Hilterman, International Crisis Group deputy program director for the Middle East and North Africa. He has argued in the past for the establishment of a truth commission process and believes such a process, for example, would have been the proper way to deal with the challenge of de-Baathification. ""I'm not against floating the idea,"" Hilterman said, but there's ""no chance in hell"" it would happen anytime soon. Eduardo Gonzalez, the Americas deputy director of the transitional justice center, had been a staffer on the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, where he was responsible for public hearings and victims and witnesses protection. He was interviewed in the USIP video, which featured touching testimony from victims of the warfare between government troops and Shining Path guerrillas between 1980 and 2000. Gonzalez stressed the need to produce an accurate account of abuses, provide explanations for what happened, provide the proper opportunity for victims to be recognized, and help the society steer a new course for the future. Truth commissions don't function as courts, and there are only rare occasions, such as in East Timor, where punishment would be meted out. ""Truth commissions, done right, could created a public dialogue,"" he said. He thinks a national Iraqi truth commission would probably be a few years down the road. But he thinks it's more likely that a particular city, province or region could pursue them. One particular truth commission, in Morocco, has been cited as one that Iraq could study. That's because it was the first one in the Arab world and it detailed human rights abuses from 1956 to 1999 under King Hassan II. Gonzalez said Iraq can benefit from studying all models, but he notes they share one thing -- a commitment to objectivity. The ICTJ's Sissons notes that the British explored the idea of a truth commission as well, but experts told them Iraqis and not outsiders are the ones who need to pursue such an idea. She also said ""the scale of violence"" in Iraq and the ""nature and complexity"" of it ""is so vast"" that the German war crimes tribunals after World War II and the reparations to Holocaust victims come to mind. But if a truth initiative is to be effective, it would have to be rigorously designed and properly framed, with a ""distinct focus"" and an ""achievable mandate,"" she said. There must be commitment, goals, dedication and governmental support in areas such as subpoenaing records. ""You don't just tell the truth, hold hands and sing 'Kumbaya,' "" she said. But they can be very useful in Iraq, an ""evidence-rich environment."" She said truth-telling commissions there could lead to many improvements in society, such as better detention registration policies, higher forensic standards, a freedom of information law, and a far-reaching reparations strategy. As for the man on the street, people who gather at Abu Wissam's house to talk about the violence they've endured don't talk of forgiveness. They want the killers of their kin to be put to death. Al-Sarraf and others all agree justice must be served in cases of heinous crime. But he seized on the concept of forgiveness. It's an Islamic virtue, and it could play a powerful role in a truth-telling initiative. ""Even though there is the principle of 'eye for an eye,' there is also the higher ideal of mercy,"" he said. CNN's Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","Relatives of slain Iraqis struggle with feelings of grief, revenge .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An Air Force F-22A fighter jet crashed Wednesday near Edwards Air Force Base in California, killing the test pilot, the Air Force said. An F-22A fighter jet similar to this one crashed Wednesday during a test mission in California. The single-seater crashed about 10:30 a.m. (1:30 p.m. ET) for unknown reasons, Air Force officials said. Lockheed Martin said the test pilot, David Cooley, 49, of Palmdale, California, joined the company in 2003 and was a 21-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force. The fighter was on a test mission when it crashed about 35 miles northeast of  Edwards AFB, where it was stationed, the Air Force said in a news release. At $150 million apiece, the F-22A is the most expensive Air Force fighter. In 2004, an F-22 Raptor crashed on a training mission in the Nevada desert. The pilot ejected and was not hurt, though the jet was destroyed. The plane was designed in the 1980s to provide a stealthy method to enter Soviet air space and strike Soviet bombers if the USSR attempted a nuclear strike. Once the Cold War ended, the Air Force found a new mission for the F-22 as a long-range fighter with a sophisticated stealth design and state-of-the-art equipment that no other plane could rival. However, the rising cost of the plane and numerous design and software problems threatened the program, which was almost eliminated by Congress. In the end, the aircraft survived, and most of the problems were fixed -- except for the price tag, which forced the Air Force to buy fewer aircraft.","NEW: Test pilot David Cooley, 49, of Palmdale, California, dies in crash .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- An elderly British couple who died together at an assisted suicide clinic in Switzerland died ""peacefully"" after receiving ""wonderful and humbling care"" from their doctors, the couple's family said. Peter and Penelope Duff from Bath, England, died in Zurich on February 27, according to a statement released Thursday by their family and reported by Britain's Press Association. Both had terminal cancer, the statement said. ""Penny had fought a rare cancer, GIST, since 1992 and Peter's colon cancer had spread to his liver,"" the statement said. ""Their decision in no way reflected on the wonderful and humbling care they have received from their consultant, doctors and nurses, for which the family, and they, were so appreciative."" Peter Duff, who was reported to be 80, was the executive chairman of Alcohol in Moderation, a nonprofit group that advocates a ""sensible drinking ethos."" His daughter, Helena Conibear, is executive director of AIM Digest, a monthly publication. Conibear and AIM could not be reached for comment Friday. The Press Association said Penelope Duff was 70. Her condition, GIST, stands for gastrointestinal stromal tumor, a rare type of cancer found in the digestive system. Dignity in Dying, a British charity that advocates the choice of assisted death for terminally ill patients, said it was ""extremely sad"" that the Duffs had to travel abroad to die. ""Had they had the option of an assisted death in this country they may still be alive, as their physical ability to travel would not have been a factor,"" said Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying. Wootton called on Parliament to modernize laws on suicide to allow for assisted dying. Phyllis Bowman, executive director of Right to Life, which opposes euthanasia, also said the Duffs' case was sad. ""I think it's very sad, particularly as they could have gone together into a hospice. A hospice with cancer -- there is not uncontrollable pain,"" Bowman told CNN. ""I think that with the euthanasia lobby, they feed on despair and they encourage despair rather than hope.""","Peter and Penelope Duff from Bath, England, died in Zurich on February 27 .

"FARGO, North Dakota (CNN) -- Fifteen helicopters from the U.S. Northern Command along with active-duty military personnel are being sent to Fargo, North Dakota, to assist the state as it prepares for record flooding, a U.S. military official told CNN. Valley Water Rescue volunteers patrol the Fargo area in search of people who need help evacuating Friday. The military personnel being sent to Fargo are from a ""contingency response force"" made up of active-duty troops, the official said. Above-freezing temperatures, followed by heavy rains this week, caused the Red River to swell and surpass its 1897 record of 40.1 feet early Friday morning. The swollen river threatened to rise further as the city's mayor vowed to ""go down swinging. ""Right now, we think the river is beginning to crest,"" said Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker. ""As long as we stay under 42 feet, I think we got a chance; if we go over 42, there's going to be some more evacuations."" As of 8:15 p.m., the river churned at 40.78 feet, nearly 22 feet above flood stage and almost a foot above the previous record of 40.1 feet, set in 1897.  Watch Fargo's mayor explain why disaster could be averted » . Sandbagging operations, which have churned furiously throughout the week, continued Friday, drawing praise from local and state officials, including North Dakota Gov. John Hoeven. ""North Dakotans have come together in a big, big way. Our volunteers are doing a magnificent job building this flood protection and we want to say thank you to them,"" he said. ""There's a sense of perseverance and resolve and determination."" Buses and evacuation staging areas have been staged west of Fargo, Hoeven said, and hundreds of people already have evacuated Fargo neighborhoods, hospitals and a nursing home.  Watch how volunteers are battling the rising water » . Fargo Deputy Mayor Tim Mahoney said authorities were evacuating the city's ""vulnerable populations"" and were asking for voluntary evacuations in sites near retaining dikes. The National Weather Service predicted the river would reach 42 feet Saturday, and forecasts indicated it would remain there into next week. But the weather service warned the river might reach 43 feet -- the height to which most of the city's dikes have been raised -- if warmer temperatures expected in the middle of next week melt the record snowfall.  Watch Fargo residents fight back » . ""What's going on here really is an inspiration for the country,"" said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota. ""The eyes of America are on Fargo, North Dakota, and they're getting a very good impression of what the people of North Dakota are like."" Authorities would not try to raise the city's dikes above 43 feet, Walaker said. Sandbags are used to bolster dikes in residential areas around the city, while the city dikes are reinforced with clay. ""We have most of the south side of Fargo, and along the river, good to 43, so we're not going to proceed with trying to get it to 44,"" he said at a news conference Friday morning. ""Now is that a gamble? We don't think so.""  See map of affected area » . National Weather Service spokesman Patrick Slattery in Kansas City, Missouri, said the river's level means uncertainty for officials and volunteers who are scrambling to mitigate the flooding in the area. Emergency responders can extrapolate the effects of the rising river, he said, but they cannot know for sure how accurate the predictions are because they have never seen the river so high. ""At some point, especially when you're dealing with record levels, you reach a point when there's nothing else you can do,"" Slattery said. ""Start alerting people to be ready to get out of there."" Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who led the military response to hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2007, warned that sandbags can only buy time. ""You cannot depend on a sandbag dike to save your life; you put it up to try to save your property,"" he said. ""Once you put it up, you need to leave, because that sandbag dike could break at any given time."" Sandbags also are less effective against cold water, Honore said. Read the full interview with Honore . Water began seeping Friday under a dike that runs across a partially submerged athletic field, prompting officials to ask volunteer sandbaggers to come help. About 150 people showed up as the water on the other side of the dike continued to rise. ""We're going to be OK. We're going to be fine,"" Melanie Engel Unger said as she passed 40-pound sandbags from her left to her right. Daryl Braham said he was confident the volunteers would be able to maintain the dike's integrity. He was hopeful the cold weather -- temperatures were well below freezing Friday -- remained. ""It's kind of a blessing in disguise because it's slowing things down,"" he said. Fargo officials early Friday evacuated a neighborhood of about 150 homes after they found cracks in a levee, according to a city news release. Capt. Tod Dahle said the residents were evacuated because the neighborhood lies between a primary and contingency levee. About 100 people were evacuated Thursday from a nursing home, as were 40 others from a nearby neighborhood. No one was in immediate danger, officials said.  See photos of flooding » . ""We were disappointed yesterday and early this morning about the two areas that we had to evacuate,"" Walaker said. ""Is that going to be it [for evacuations]? We don't know. We don't have any real crystal ball to look into."" MeritCare Hospital and MeritCare South University had evacuated 177 patients as of Friday, MeritCare Health System spokeswoman Carrie Haug said. Some were taken to hospitals elsewhere in North Dakota; others were taken across the river to Minnesota, she said. Monday, the health system canceled elective procedures to reduce its patient numbers ahead of the evacuations, Haug said. Across the Red River from Fargo, a U.S. senator said some homes had been lost in Moorhead, Minnesota. Emphasizing that there are two states dealing with the river's rise, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, said, ""This is a time at which the forces of nature, of the Red River, will meet the forces of the human spirit."" Clay County emergency center spokesman Dan Olson said some residents in Moorhead were being asked to evacuate. He called it a ""directed evacuation,"" rather than a mandatory one. It also applied to large parts of nearby Oakport Township, he said. The emergency center is setting up a call center where evacuees can register to be tracked. A spokeswoman at the city's emergency call center said she would put the number of evacuees in the ""high hundreds."" ""We know our highways are pretty congested"" with people leaving, Kasey Cummings said. Minnesota State University at Moorhead and Concordia College had voluntarily closed, she said. To the west, about 1,500 people who evacuated North Dakota's capital, Bismarck, on Wednesday were able to return home Thursday, after the Missouri River dropped more than 3 feet, the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services said.

"(CNN) -- With a chance of winning an Oscar on Sunday, the director of ""The Final Inch"" says she hopes her documentary will shed light on the often over-looked issue of polio eradication. The more doses of the vaccination a child receives, the better protected the child is from contracting polio. ""I felt like I was looking at something that no one in the world talks about,"" Irene Taylor Brodsky, who also helped produce the film, said in a recent interview. Filming the short documentary was an ""eye-opening experience,"" she said, particularly for one of her co-producers who had to wear a bulletproof vest during filming in Afghanistan. ""The Final Inch"" is a testament of the health workers around the world laboring to make polio the second globally eliminated disease behind small pox, Brodsky said. The 37-minute film, which is scheduled to air on HBO on April 1, has been nominated for an Academy Award in the best documentary short subject category. The awards ceremony is Sunday night. The film focuses on ""the final stages of a 20 year initiative"" to eradicate polio around the world, Brodsky said. Polio is a highly infectious disease which lingers in the poor water systems of India, Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. The more doses of the vaccination a child receives, the better protected the child is from contracting polio. ""The Final Inch"" focuses on the polio vaccine efforts in India and Pakistan. Brodsky said she hoped to include Afghanistan, but that became impossible because of the threat of violence and social barriers. Producer Tom Grant had to wear a bulletproof vest while filming in the war-torn country. He was unable to capture compelling footage because of familial protocol that forbids a man from entering a home full of women while no husband is present. Thus, Grant was often denied access, Brodsky said. In many countries, people are hesitant to vaccinate their children against polio because of a distrust of the government. Some civilians believe the vaccination to be ""something more sinister like a sterilizing drug"" produced to curtail their population, Brodsky explained. She said she often ran into ""the skepticism that some communities have against our government in cooperation with their own government."" ""It never occurred to me that U.S. foreign policies could affect young children living in the most densely populated areas,"" she said. Although it has been 50 years since the United States developed a vaccination for polio, millions of children abroad remain unprotected. ""Ordinary American people have forgotten polio,"" Brodsky said. And, although the number of polio cases have been reduced by 99 percent, the highly infectious disease is still very real. ""It really limits the opportunities a child might have as an adult,"" said Oliver Rosenbauer, a spokesman for the World Health Organization's Global Polio Eradication Initiative. As part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, 20 million volunteers deliver vaccinations to schools, bus stops and rail stations across the world on a daily basis. Only four countries had recorded cases of polio in 2008, down from 125 countries 10 years ago, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. This year, there have been 26 recorded cases of polio around the world, compared with 46 people who were infected with polio last year. ""But we're only in mid-February. That doesn't say much,"" Rosenbauer said. He said that he is most concerned that a child suffering from polio will have a difficult time integrating into society, building friendships and finding a job. ""So it's much more than just the fact that this child will be physically disabled for the rest of his or her life,"" he added. ""It is the opportunity that is lost from the life they might have led."" CNN and HBO are both part of Time Warner.","'The Final Inch' focuses on the polio vaccine efforts in India and Pakistan .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Watching Iain Softley's motley, jewel-toned adaptation of ""Inkheart,"" the best-selling 2003 young-adult novel by Cornelia Funke, I had the distinct sensation of being a young bookworm again, falling into a world as vividly real as it is impossible. Brendan Fraser stars as Mo, a literature lover who brings characters to life when he reads aloud. In Funke's universe -- given voice in a screenplay by fantasy-friendly playwright David Lindsay-Abaire -- a literature lover named Mo (Brendan Fraser) possesses a dangerous talent for bringing characters from books to life when he reads aloud. The downside? When a fictional figure comes alive, a real person must disappear into the book's pages. That explains the extended absence of Mo's wife, Resa (Sienna Guillory). Mo has not yet told the truth about Resa's disappearance to their intrepid young daughter, Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett), just as many a movie adult before him annoyingly withheld information from their children for dramatic effect. (Maybe Fraser's Mo, a pleasantly square-framed American among a population of Brits, just can't bring himself to utter the word ''Mummy.'') It also explains the presence of a rambunctious crowd of fictional interlopers. These include a soulful fire juggler (Paul Bettany) who yearns for home (and why not, when real-life wife Jennifer Connelly appears briefly as the juggler's fairy-tale missus), and an acquisitive villain named Capricorn (Andy Serkis, always welcome even without his Gollum suit). A unicorn and ""The Wizard of Oz's"" flying monkeys also make appearances -- as does, briefly, Toto too. The story is a whirl, a jumble, an effusion -- sometimes flowing smoothly, other times jerking along as if the filmmaker (""Backbeat,"" ""The Wings of the Dove"") has been given advice he resents regarding pacing and the balance of sweetness and danger. There are close calls, weird whispers, amusing throwaway lines, the ditherings of a distractible author (Jim Broadbent), and cartoon violence undertaken by misshapen scary-comic evil henchmen. But most deliciously madcap of all, there are the grand gestures and imperious pronouncements of Helen Mirren as Meggie's flesh-and-blood great-aunt Elinor, a creature of pencil-thin eyebrows and luscious costumery who caws and squawks with very unqueenly abandon. Mirren's all-out display in this distinctly British absurdo-literary extravaganza had me wishing Elinor were my own fabulous auntie and that she'd lend me some magic items from her closet.

"(CNN)  -- President-elect Barack Obama, President Bush and all of the surviving past presidents got together Wednesday for a historic meeting at the White House. Barack Obama meets with President Bush and past presidents in the Oval Office on Wednesday. ""One message that I have, and I think we all share, is that we want you to succeed. Whether we're Democrat or Republican, we care deeply about this country,"" Bush told Obama before lunch with the former presidents. Bush and Obama were joined by Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Obama thanked the president for hosting them and said he was grateful for the opportunity to get ""advice, good counsel and fellowship"" from the group.  Watch what Obama says about the meeting » . Obama's press secretary said the presidents had a ""very constructive conversation"" and Obama appreciated ""the spirit of bipartisanship they showed"" in wishing him success. ""The president and the former presidents had helpful advice on managing the office, as well as thoughts on the critical issues facing the country right now. The president-elect is anxious to stay in touch with all of them in the coming years,""  Robert Gibbs said. Presidential historian Doug Brinkley said it's ""very smart politics for Obama to keep a channel open"" with the former presidents. ""If he has a policy initiative that he wants to lead the country behind ... if he could get the signatures, the green light from all of the ex-presidents to say, 'Not only am I for this, but I have all of the ex-presidents backing me' -- that's powerful,"" he said. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the last time all of the living presidents got together at the White House was in 1981, and she called Wednesday's meeting a ""historic moment."" She said the president was ""delighted"" to host the luncheon. ""Each of them expressed their desire for President-elect Obama to have a very successful presidency. During the lunch, they had a wide-ranging discussion on many different issues facing the United States, and they all look forward to remaining in contact in the future,""  Perino said. The meeting marked the second time Bush has hosted Obama since the election. Obama suggested the meeting with all of the former presidents when he and Bush first met in November. Perino said earlier she didn't know what they would talk about, but she said she'd love to be able to hear it. ""I'm sure all of us would love to be flies on the wall and listening to that conversation,"" Perino said during Tuesday's daily news briefing. Perino speculated that they would discuss what it's like to raise children in the White House and how to protect them. Brinkley predicted that first and foremost, the presidents would recall what it was like to be president. ""All of them will have little anecdotes. They'll see something in the White House that will bring back a memory. They'll try to bring some levity to this -- make it a very special and engaging and actually a fun afternoon for Barack Obama,"" he said. Secondly, Brinkley said, the conversation would probably turn to what's going on in the Middle East. Brinkley said that all of the men will be on their ""best behavior,"" but, given the personalities at the luncheon, there could be some tension. ""The friction, if there is any, is between Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, who are known to not like each other at all,"" he said, pointing out that the Clinton team did not like Carter ""parachuting for peace into Bosnia, North Korea and Haiti"" during Clinton's administration. ""That's the relationship that is not warm, it's not good, and if you are a body language expert, you might home in on that,"" he said. President Bush may find himself the odd man out at the meeting, at least in terms of popularity. Bush registered only a 27 percent approval rating in a December CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey. In contrast, Obama had an 82 percent approval rating. A new poll out Wednesday indicates that 69 percent of adult Americans approved of how Clinton handled his job as president, while 64 percent of adult Americans gave a thumbs up to Carter and 60 percent approved of George H.W. Bush. CNN's Lauren Kornreich contributed to this report .","Historian calls meeting ""smart politics,"" says it'll be light, but could be tense .

"(CNN) -- Antarctica is warming in line with the rest of the world, according to a new study on climate change in Antarctica. Temperatures across Antarctica have traditionally varied between east and west, scientists say. Rather than being the last bastion to resist global warming, U.S. research has found that for the past 50 years much of the continent of Antarctica has been getting warmer. For years common belief among scientists studying climate change was that a large part of Antarctica, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, has been getting colder while the rest of the world has warmed. However the new research from the University of Washington has found that warming in West Antarctica exceeded one-tenth of a degree Celsius per decade for the past 50 years, which more than offsets the cooling in East Antarctica. ""West Antarctica is a very different place than East Antarctica, and there is a physical barrier, the Transantarctic Mountains, that separates the two,"" said Professor Eric Steig, lead author of the research paper. The study's findings appeared in Thursday's issue of the scientific journal Nature. At 6,000 feet (1,829 meters) above sea level the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is around 4,000 feet lower than East Antarctica and subject to warm, moist storms and more snowfall. In gathering the data Steig and fellow researchers used information from satellites, which was crucial in providing new insight into patterns of temperature change across the continent. Previous research on climate in Antarctica that relied solely on Antarctic weather stations, in place since 1957, could not get as much information about conditions on the interior of the continent as most are placed within a short distance of the coast. ""Simple explanations don't capture the complexity of climate,"" Steig said. ""The thing you hear all the time is that Antarctica is cooling and that's not the case. If anything it's the reverse, but it's more complex than that. Antarctica isn't warming at the same rate everywhere, and while some areas have been cooling for a long time the evidence shows the continent as a whole is getting warmer."" A major reason most of Antarctica was thought to be cooling was because of a hole in the ozone layer that appears during the spring months in the Southern Hemisphere's polar region. Steig noted that it is well established that the ozone hole has contributed to cooling in East Antarctica. ""However, it seems to have been assumed that the ozone hole was affecting the entire continent when there wasn't any evidence to support that idea, or even any theory to support it,"" he said. ""In any case, efforts to repair the ozone layer eventually will begin taking effect and the hole could be eliminated by the middle of this century. If that happens, all of Antarctica could begin warming on a par with the rest of the world.""","Common belief that Antarctica is getting colder debunked by new report .

"In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. CNN's Jay Kernis reports on what it was like inside the Kodak Theatre at the Academy Awards. Hugh Jackman, the host of the 81st Academy Awards, speaks to the audience at the Kodak Theatre on Sunday. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When you're at home, you can sit back and be critical. When you're inside the theater, the whole show seems to work, especially the big production numbers. Maybe it was a particularly well-produced show this year, but when you're in the audience, you feel part of it -- even way up in the second mezzanine. I've been at the Oscars to cover them, but this is the first time I've ever been inside the ceremonies. I was there with my 17-year-old son, Noah. When you arrive on the red carpet, you enter a security tent and show your ticket and driver's license. You notice that the tent is bisected by red velvet ropes and, with a friendly and practiced technique, celebrities are moved to the left of the rope and others to the right. This way, celebs leave the tent closer to the cameras and the fantasy that you might have that everybody in a gown or tux are somehow equals on one night sort of disappears.  View scenes from the Oscars » . If you ever were curious about what happens during the commercial breaks: Stagehands with really powerful flashlights guide the changing of the sets and curtains; they make sure empty orchestra seats are filled; host Hugh Jackman introduces his parents; they show a short film about the power of the movies that got cut from the show in progress; Jackman hands his wife a plate of cookies, thinking she probably was hungry; and he later points out that the guy playing the cello on stage in the Academy Award Orchestra was actor Dermot Mulroney. Who knew?  Watch a report on the night's big winners » . The show was best when it demonstrated that Hollywood can still do what it has always done well: getting your attention and holding it -- seeing five Best Actors presenting Oscars on the same stage was pretty amazing. So is Best Actor Sean Penn's self-awareness. The Oscars can still astonish: They still know how to put on the big musical number, with a hundred dancing performers in top hats, moving with Busby Berkeley precision. They still know how to break your heart: Heath Ledger's parents and sister received his Academy Award and said that they did so in celebration. But I bet they'd rather have had him accept it. And for all of the breathtaking special effects that Hollywood can muster, for all the star power in the theater last night, there was something remarkable about seeing Philippe Petit in person -- the wire walker who, in 1974, hovered between the World Trade Center towers for 45 minutes. There was something joyous about watching him balance an Oscar statue on his chin.","When you're inside the theater, the whole show seems to work, and you feel part of it .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lankan soldiers seized a key rebel stronghold over the weekend, as humanitarian agencies feared for the safety of civilians. Sri Lankan troops at Elephant Pass, the isthmus that connects north Jaffna peninsula to rest of the country. ""It's an incredibly serious situation,"" James Elder, a U.N. spokesman, said Monday. ""We have a very large number of people, including tens of thousands of children, trapped in a fast-shrinking conflict zone."" Government forces took the area in a surprise attack early Sunday, the head of Sri Lanka's army announced. Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency. ""Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track,"" Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address Sunday. ""This is the long-awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years,"" he said. There has been no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead. The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government. In recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds. Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula. It had been in rebel hands for more than nine years. The recapture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea. ""The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally,"" Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. ""They lost ... about 90 percent of what they had."" Despite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict. ""This is a critical moment in the conflict when the space for these people has shrunk,"" Elder said. The United Nations is ""calling on the ... Tamil Tigers to meet their international responsibilities and guarantee that these very large civilian populations to move freely and then can move away from the conflict and to areas where they can receive appropriate assistance,"" Elder said. ""Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there,"" he said in a Sunday interview. ""Convoys are going to the area, delivering emergency supplies, but these are not sufficient for the number of people in need."" Sri Lankan authorities are barring journalists and humanitarian aid workers from areas where heavy fighting is taking place. Amnesty International spokesman Shuransu Mishra estimated that ""over a quarter of a million of the population, mostly Tamils, are trapped between the two sides."" The organization says greater access and protection for aid workers and journalists are needed as news agencies struggle to report an accurate picture of the conflict. ""The Sri Lankan authorities are doing little to ensure the safety of the country's media, or to prosecute those responsible for murdering or attacking them,"" Amnesty International spokeswoman Yolanda Foster said in a written statement on Friday. The Sri Lankan authorities ""are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation,"" she said. At least 14 journalists have been killed since the start of 2006, according to the statement. Others have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.","Government forces took the area in a surprise attack early Sunday .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lanka President Mahinda Rajapaksa claimed Friday there was ""a conspiracy with certain international forces"" to belittle his government's military victories against Tamil Tiger rebels. Sri Lankan army troops have had there most decisive victories against the Tamil Tigers in recent weeks. The aim of these conspirators, he said in an address to the nation, ""is to level unfounded charges against the army commander who works with greatest dedication to achieve these victories."" He also used the address to formally announce the recapture of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula. It had remained in rebel hands for over nine years. The recapture enable the government to use the A-9 highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Until now it was done either by air or by sea. Rajapaksa's remarks came amid mounting attacks on the media. On Tuesday a group armed with rifles, pistols and grenades attacked the country's most popular privately owned television channel MTV. The main control room equipment costing more than $ 1.7 million was damaged. On Thursday, Lasantha Wickrematunga, chief editor of The Sunday Leader, a newspaper which had exposed corruption and criticized aspects of ongoing military operations, was shot dead. Earlier Friday, the leader of the main opposition United National Party (UNP), Ranil Wickremasinghe, accused military and security officials of the attacks, saying the government could not control them. ""Armed forces members are shocked about these incidents. The armed forces says due to the activities of few intelligence sections, the reputation of the country is being ruined. That is the team which the government has no control of,"" he told parliament. Rajapaksa said there were efforts to belittle military victories ""to turn the attention of the people to other directions."" He said such ""conspiracies arise when a country moves ahead without giving in to external pressures."" He added ""one must not mistake these conspiracies as being against me or my government. This is a conspiracy against the entire country by those who have been driven to fear due to the successes of our security forces."" Meanwhile, fighting in northern Sri Lanka between government and rebel forces escalated on several fronts Friday, while Tamil Tiger rebels killed seven people in a roadside bombing. Three members of the Sri Lankan air force and four civilians died when rebels exploded a claymore landmine in the village of Morawewa, near the northeastern port city of Trincomalee, police said. The strategic port town is located about 240km (150 miles) north of the capital, Colombo. Friday's incident came as troops pursued their military campaign in the northern Wanni region to recapture remaining rebel strongholds, military sources said. Government troops were said to be meeting fierce resistance as they advanced on the Tamil stronghold of Mullaitivu and a naval blockade remained in the northeastern seas. The 25-year long civil war has left more than 65,000 people dead. The U.S. State Department has designated the Tamil Tigers a terrorist organization.","Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa makes conspiracy claims .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian star Kaka is leading the campaign for David Beckham to stay at Italian giants AC Milan beyond his agreed loan spell. Former England captain David Beckham has made an immediate impact with his contribution at AC Milan. The England midfielder is due to return to the Los Angeles Galaxy in March but  playmaker Kaka said Beckham had already shown his star qualities. The 33-year-old played 89 minutes of the 2-2 draw with Roma on Sunday following a friendly outing against Hamburg. ""David has shown that he is a player ready to run the extra mile,"" Kaka told a news conference in Zurich ahead of FIFA's world player of the year gala. ""The first matches showed quite clearly what his qualities are and his passing ability and his capacity to play well. ""Perhaps these first two months will lead to six months or to one year, to more contracts. I certainly would like to play more with him."" Beckham's advisers have stressed that there are no plans for him to stay at AC Milan beyond March 9. However, former Galaxy general manager Alexi Lalas last week expressed fears that Beckham could be tempted to bring an early end to his time in the U.S. AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti revealed Beckham's attitude and intelligence had won him a place in the starting side in Rome where he had been expected to start on the bench. ""He did well,"" said Ancelotti. ""I chose Beckham to start because he proved in recent days to be a very intelligent player and serious. ""The appearance against Roma is a small reward for him because he worked very hard and has adapted well to the team. ""This was only his second game with us and he will improve. I believe everyone is happy to have Beckham here."" Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf said: ""We have to compliment him. He has done a good job and he grew in the game. He still needs to improve but I think he can be very satisfied with what he has done after two months of not playing."" Roma stand-in captain Daniele De Rossi suggested Milan had made a shrewd move in capturing the 33-year-old. ""From a media standpoint Beckham is impressive,"" De Rossi said. ""He is a nice guy, has a beautiful wife, has won so many trophies in his career and perhaps this penalises him as a player although I believe he has the feet and the determination."" Beckham, meanwhile, forecast that Sunday's double goalscorer Alexandre Pato of Brazil is destined for greatness. ""I have seen him in training and on the pitch. He is only 19 years of age and I think he can become one of the greatest players in the world,"" said Beckham. Milan are nine points behind Serie A leaders Inter going into Saturday's home game against Fiorentina with Beckham seemingly set to retain his starting slot.","Brazilian star Kaka wants David Beckham to extend his loan at AC Milan .

"(CNN) -- Every time her cell phone rings, Christy Harness thinks of her husband. More consumers download ringtones to their cell phones than  full-length songs. The 34-year-old native of Jackson County, Georgia, set her ringtone to Sugarland's ""All I Wanna Do,"" a song that, she says, perfectly expresses the way she feels about him. ""I kind of put myself in [the singer's] place because ... she's in love with this guy. If he's not around, she misses him. Basically, I think the song relates to me and [my husband] and our relationship,"" Harness said. These days, ringtones do much more than alert mobile phone users of a call. Ringtones seem to have become vital fashion statements, a way for people to showcase their personalities and even their feelings about who is calling. According to a 2008 study by Ipsos MediaCT, a marketing research company, approximately one-third of mobile phone users download ringtones, and about 40 percent of users change their ringtones frequently. Ipsos research shows that ringtones are the most common type of mobile music content downloaded by users, compared to full-length songs and ringback tones, tones that replace the typical ringing signal heard by the caller. ""I find regular ringtones kind of dull, so I wanted something exciting,"" said Gordy King, a 51-year-old from Salt Lake City, Utah. King said he gets a kick out of annoying his mostly Republican co-workers with his Barack Obama ringtones, even playing them over the intercom at the electrical supply warehouse where he works. ""It's fake news people saying 'Barack Obama has won the election,' "" he said. ""I really like Barack Obama. I think [my ringtone] probably says that I'm nonconventional and it says I lean a little more liberal. I don't know anyone else who has that ringtone."" Using a ringtone creator application on Facebook, King said he also makes his own ringtones by downloading sound files onto his computer and editing them to be shorter and louder or softer. Donald Kaplan found a perfect fit with his ringtone choice. Kaplan, of New York, changed his ringtones often before finally settling on the theme song from ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly."" ""I'm thinking of sticking with it. I notice that when people hear my phone ring they get amused ... I think that people really connect with that movie,"" Kaplan said. But that's not always the case. Kaplan said one of his co-workers wasn't exactly pleased with the ringtone. The co-worker sent a mass e-mail to the office, telling everyone to keep their cell phones on silent. ""The ringtone drove him crazy and he tried to be tactful but I knew that [the e-mail] was directed specifically to me,"" Kaplan said. ""I could tell that this particular ringtone just drove him up the wall ... just the repetition of the sound."" For some, one ringtone simply isn't enough. Many mobile phone users set specific tones to specific people so that the tones act as audible caller IDs. ""I group people,"" said Natasha Khan, a 26-year-old from McLean, Virginia. ""I group all my best girlfriends together, the people I don't want to talk to together, work contacts together, and family together."" Khan said when her best friends call she hears ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,"" by Cyndi Lauper, and when she gets a call from people she doesn't particularly like, her phone rings ""Bugaboo"" by Destiny's Child. ""Bugaboo,"" about a woman irritated by a male caller, contains such lines as, ""It's not hot that you be callin' me."" ""The 'Bugaboo' ringtone has gotten me in trouble,"" Khan said with a laugh. ""This guy -- I forgot that he was on that list and I told him I needed his number and he said, 'Oh, I'll call you' and he realized he was on the list."" Customizing a phone with multiple ringtones can be expensive. Depending on the wireless carrier or the service plan, ringtones cost anywhere from $0.99 to $2.99. That may not deter cell phone users. Analysts at Screen Digest, a UK-based firm covering global media markets, predicted that mobile music sales will double from $1.6 billion in 2008 to $3.2 billion in 2012. But there are also free ways to get ringtones, like the ringtone creator application on Facebook -- one of several ringtone applications on the social-networking Web site -- that make setting ringtones all the more appealing. ""The ringtone creator was fun,"" said King. ""No matter how big or little the song or sound effect ... you could select a snippet and edit it."" Many mobile phone users like to be creative and have fun with their ringtones, and their ringtone choice can reveal much about their personalities. Khan's default ringtone, she said, is typically an upbeat dance song like her current one, ""Forever"" by Chris Brown. ""I think the day can be so mundane and work can bog you down, so I like any chance I can get to get some joy,"" Khan said. ""It's just a break in the day to feel good randomly.""","Ringtones are one way for people to showcase their personalities and feelings .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British reality TV star Jade Goody married Sunday after being told by doctors last week that her cancer is terminal. Jade Goody, pictured with fiance Jack Tweed Saturday,  before Sunday's wedding . Goody, 27 tied the knot with boyfriend Jack Tweed, 21, in Hatfield Heath, Essex, east of London, UK media reported. After the ceremony Max Clifford, the couple's publicist, told waiting reporters that there had been ""lots of tears and smiles and laughter"" and that the congregation gave the newlyweds a standing ovation after the signing of the register. Goody sprung to fame in ""Big Brother"" in 2002, going on to launch a range of her own products and host TV shows. But her return to the celebrity edition of the show in 2007 ended in international ignominy, after her taunting of Indian Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty. Goody's behavior resulted in more than 40,000 complaints and sparked protests in India.  Shetty said last week that she was unable to attend the wedding due to filming commitments but was praying for Goody. Read blog about how media covered wedding . In August 2008 Goody appeared on the Indian version of ""Big Brother,"" only to fly home after she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. News of Goody's condition has sparked massive interest in the UK, both from the media -- which bid for rights to her story -- and among the public, who have contacted charities for information about cervical cancer. Critics have attacked Goody's decision to sell rights to what may be her final weeks, although the star has told British media that she wants to leave her children by a previous relationship -- sons, Bobby, five, and Freddie, four -- financially secure. Watch Jade Goody's wedding preparations » . But Clifford told ITN: ""Ironically, a big part of what she's doing now is to fund her children's education. To give them the education she never had."" Charity Cancer Research UK said in a statement earlier this month that daily visits to its Web site had increased two- to three-fold since news of Goody's illness was announced. ""The publicity around Jade's diagnosis has led many more people to ask questions and seek information about cervical cancer,"" spokeswoman Emma Gilgunn-Jones said. Shetty, writing on her blog earlier this week, said that Goody had invited her to the wedding but had been unable to attend due to filming commitments in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ""Read an article on Jade Goody's deteriorating condition,"" wrote Shetty. ""It disturbed me 'cause the last time I spoke to her, she seemed very positive and we were all expecting that the doctors would be able to curb the cancer from spreading. This piece of news came as a shock - so I called her hoping it was only a rumor but she confirmed it. Shetty added that she was praying for Goody and that she hoped God ""gives her the strength to cope with this pain."" ""She wants the best for her kids,"" Shetty wrote. ""I hope Jack makes a good father to them. I also hope for a miracle to happen for her children's sake."" On Friday the UK's Ministry of Justice said it would allow Tweed, who was jailed in September 2008 for assault, to spend his wedding night with his bride, the Press Association reported. ""We are absolutely thrilled,"" the agency reported Clifford as saying. ""It will be the dream finish to her dream day, and it makes so much difference. Tweed, who was released early from jail in January, has to wear a tag and is subject to a 1900 GMT curfew. ""We'll get married if I have to drag her wheelchair down the aisle,"" he told ITN last week. The wedding dress, which media reports say included a pouch to hold Goody's medication, was donated by Harrods owner Mohamed al Fayed.  Goody's bridesmaids were seen with the TV star Saturday, wearing plastic bald caps in a show of solidarity at the impact of her chemotherapy treatment.","Publicist: Couple receive standing ovation, lots of tears, laughter, smiles .

"(CNN) -- Venus Williams is most often seen wiping perspiration from her brow as she thunders around the court contesting championship tennis matches. Venus Williams steps off the tennis court and into the pool in a series of photos to be featured in Italian Marie Claire. These photos show the world number six in a more reflective mood, posing for a 16-page fashion spread in the Italian edition of Marie Claire. They were taken in Miami, Florida in December last year by her friend and photographer Koto Bolofo. ""I love working with Koto,"" Venus told CNN in an interview for ""Revealed."" ""I think he's my biggest fan and he believes in me, I'm not sure why, but he does so I've got to accept that,"" she laughed. They planned to shoot 20 outfits in one day, a hectic schedule that included one photo that had been two years in the making.  See video of the photo shoot » . ""I've got it pictured in my mind that she's going to be playing tennis underwater,"" Bolofo told CNN. When the sun finally emerged from behind a cloud, Bolofo ordered Venus into her bathers. ""I'm excited it's my first underwater tennis venture, so I feel a little nervous, but I think I'll come through,"" Venus said. ""I want her smiling and making it look as if it's natural and it's not an effort,"" Bolofo explained. ""It's going to be whimsical and fun. That's the fun part of the shoot."" Fashion is an important part of Venus Williams' life. She has her own clothing company, EleVen, which produces tennis outfits and casual clothing. She sketches ideas, but says she's not the chief designer, by any stretch. ""There are other people designing stuff. I couldn't do it on my own,"" she said, adding, ""I don't do technical drawing, I hated it in school. I refuse to do this on the computer. I'd rather just do it by hand."" Venus' status in the ranks of the world's top tennis players gives her a unique position to be able to market her products and she often wears them on court. Then there's her interior design company; Venus launched V Starr Interiors while still in her early twenties. Despite her public business interests, Venus told CNN she's not interested in seizing the spotlight for any reason other than as one of the world's best tennis players. ""Fame has never been important to me. My goals have always been to excel in tennis, and to win championships. Fame has never been my focus and I don't really try to grow it at all,"" she said. Venus' relaxed attitude has earned her respect beyond the world of tennis. Hip hop star Wyclef Jean released a song in her honor last year called ""I'm Ready.""  Listen to the song » . ""[It's like] when a painter is inspired,"" Jean told CNN. ""When I'm inspired by an individual I just write a song about them ... I said her name is Venus, ruler of the universe."" Venus was thrilled. ""I've got it on my computer, all the different instrumentals, the different versions, the different cuts. I love it,"" she told CNN. Venus Williams is back on court this week at the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships. Naturally, she's hoping to win after a disappointing early exit from the Australian Open in January. While tennis remains her prime obsession, Venus told CNN it's not the most important thing in her life. ""I would say definitely the most important thing in my life is growing spiritually. And doing what God requires of me -- that's always a learning experience day in and day out,"" she said. Watch Venus Williams on Revealed this week at the times below: .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Polish authorities in Pakistan say they are monitoring local reports that Taliban militants have executed a kidnapped Polish engineer. Pakistani Taliban militants offer prayers in Mamouzai area of . Orakzai Agency in November. Piotr Stancza was kidnapped September 28 from the city of Attock in Punjab province. Stancza had been based there for a Polish survey company searching for natural gas. Local reports and TV station Dawn News reported Stancza's execution Saturday. Polish Embassy spokesman Peter Adams said his offices were aware of local media reports but were waiting to hear officially from Pakistani authorities. He said all efforts had been made by Polish authorities to pressure the Pakistani government to do whatever it could to secure Stancza's release. ""From the Polish side, we did whatever we could, pressuring the Pakistani government on the presidential and prime minister level,"" Adams said. ""Problem was, this was solely Pakistan's responsibility. Demands were only towards [the] Pakistan government."" Adams said there had been no demands for ransom. The Taliban had demanded the release of Taliban prisoners being held by the government and a pullout of government security forces from the tribal areas. Although there were assurances that the Pakistani government was doing everything it could and that Stancza would be freed soon, Adams said it was never clear what the government was actually doing to secure his release. ""We are waiting for confirmation and waiting for any answer [about] how this happened and why did this happen,"" Adams said. A spokesman for Pakistan's interior ministry said that the reports of Stancza's death have yet to be confirmed and that the case of his kidnapping was a high priority for the government. Shahid Ullah Baig said the government had been working hard to retrieve Stancza unharmed but did not give details. ""The Pakistan government is doing its level best to secure his release,"" he said, adding, ""Human life is more important to us than anything else."" Kidnappings and attacks against foreigners have risen sharply in recent months throughout the country. Most recently, an American working for the United Nations was kidnapped in Quetta, and Peshawar has been the scene of various attacks against foreign diplomats and journalists.","Piotr Stancza kidnapped September 28 from Attock in Punjab province .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's accident prone ""Octopus UFO"" is just one of hundreds of unexplained sightings in the same area where a wind turbine was wrecked over the weekend, according to the latest reports. The Sun tabloid newspaper's UFO splash. Britain's tabloid Sun newspaper Thursday proclaimed from its front page that a wind turbine was ruined after a UFO hit one of its 20 meter-long blades in Conisholme, Lincolnshire. It quoted residents who saw strange balls of lights in the sky and heard a loud bang. However, another British national newspaper said the lights were just fireworks from a staff member's dad's birthday celebration. Turbine experts suggested it was a simple mechanical failure. The plot thickened further Friday, with The Sun saying it had been ""bombarded"" with reports of UFO sightings from hundreds of witnesses in the area where the turbine was destroyed. Watch video on the UFO incident . ""There have been reports of flying saucers for more than six months,"" the newspaper said. Local John Harrison, 32, told The Sun he looked out of his window and saw ""a massive ball of light with tentacles going right down to the ground."" The newspaper said ""other respected witnesses, such as local council chairman Robert Palmer and GP Jenny Watson, described seeing 'streaking white lights'."" Quoting unnamed Ministry of Defence ""insiders,"" The Sun said the UFO sightings may be an unmanned stealth bomber on test flights. It said the Taranis ""black delta-wing craft"" was being developed nearby to deliver bombs undetected in war zones; back to the testing board then? However, initial reports when the Taranis contract was let last year said it would take at least four years to develop with flight testing due 2010... in Australia. CNN has also been ""bombarded"" with messages, but mainly from people less than convinced. J. Kale believed there was a very simple explanation. ""The octopus thing obviously thought the wind turbine was a female doing a mating dance and tried to mate with it."" Trevor Brown was worried the aliens did not ""know how to drive a flying octopus."" Mono was worried what the aliens might think about the fuss. ""Well, let's hope there is intelligent life watching us. It would at least prove there is intelligence somewhere."" Maxim, who lives near the turbines, had a simple explanation for the lights. ""On Sunday there was a very spectacular meteor shower, like fireworks on the horizontal."" Lilia was unimpressed with some of the explanations -- and your writer. ""Listen, just report the story and follow through. Think you can do that? Without screwing up? The plausible explanations are absurd. You are going to tell me that the residents of the area are not going to recognize fireworks? This is a ridiculous and insulting explanation and it sounds exactly like that, offensive and ridiculous. I don't know if there was a UFO or not, but it is all rather odd. What I do know is that the arrogant tone has got to stop."" Is it life Jim but not as we know it?

"(CNN) -- Raul Gonzalez became the leading scorer in Real Madrid history after scoring twice in the 4-0 Primera Liga victory at Sporting Gijon on Sunday. Raul celebrates in familiar style after breaking Di Stefano's Real Madrid record against Sporting Gijon. The 31-year-old moved two goals ahead of the legendary Alfredo Di Stefano with his 308th and 309th strikes in the famous white shirt. Raul is also the all-time leading scorer in the Champions League and has helped the capital club claim six Primera Liga crowns during almost 15 years' service at the Bernabeu. His first goal, in the 15th minute, came when Sergio Ramos found space down the right before crossing for Raul to volley home. Dutch forward Klaas-Jan Huntelaar had not scored for Real since his 20 million euro move from Ajax, but finally broke his duck with a neat finish on 37 minutes to double Real's advantage. Brazilian Marcelo skilfully slotted home the third goal to wrap the game up early in the second half before Raul netted again to complete a comfortable victory. The win was Real's eighth consecutive Premier Liga success and ensured the defending champions closed the gap to runaway leaders Barcelona to 10 points. On Saturday, Barca had to come from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Real Betis with Samuel Eto'o scoring both goals to take his tally to 23 goals for the season.","Raul Gonzalez scores two as Real Madrid beat Sporting Gijon 4-0 on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations is urging countries to invest in green jobs working with ""sustainable forest management"" to address the growing problem of unemployment worldwide. A deforested area appears in a rain forest in Brazil's Para state  in October. At least 10 million such jobs could be created, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization will say in a report to be released this week. The report does not mention any countries but is aimed at ""mainly regions with substantial rural unemployment and degraded land areas,"" said C.T.S. Nair, chief economist in the U.N. Forestry Department and one of the authors of the report. While all countries could benefit from investing in these green jobs, Nair said, Asia and Africa -- and to some extent Latin America -- could benefit the most. India, China and almost all countries in Africa stand to benefit, he added. The United Nations said it already is seeing indications that some countries -- such as the United States, India and South Korea -- are interested and taking action to invest in sustainable forest management by making it part of their economic stimulus plans. Sustainable forestry aims to prevent depletion of forests by managing them and making sure their use does not interfere with natural benefits or the local environment. For example, in forests where wood is being removed, the United Nations is suggesting that people be hired to monitor and manage how much wood is taken out to ensure the forest does not become depleted and can grow back fully. Managers also would make sure the wood harvest wouldn't affect biodiversity and the water supply. The report will be discussed and analyzed next week at the U.N. Committee on Forestry meeting in Rome, Italy. The Food and Agriculture Organization has designated next week as World Forest Week.","U.N. says countries should invest in green jobs for ""sustainable forest management""

"COMO, Mississippi (CNN) -- Mary Dowden smiles when she thinks about this moment in history. At 80 years old, she's the granddaughter of a slave who was born in a cotton field outside of Como, Mississippi. Mary Dowden, 80, is the granddaughter of a slave. Barack Obama is bringing white and blacks together, she says. It's difficult to put into words how she feels about Barack Obama, the issues so complex for a black country girl who lost both her parents by the age of 18 and then had to work a hard-scrabble life as a sharecropper. ""I was really afraid for him, because I didn't want nobody to kill him,"" she says when asked about casting her ballot for Obama. But she pauses and smiles. ""I'm awfully proud of him, as a black person.""  Watch ""white and black is coming together"" » . Did she ever think she would see this moment? ""No, I didn't,"" she says. ""I always thought that, you know, the white was over the black, that they was the leading folks, that one nation is gonna be over another one, and that would be the white over the black. I never thought it would be a black president."" With Obama's election, CNN.com traveled to the town of Como to talk with African-Americans about their experience growing up black in Mississippi and what this moment in history means to them. Como is a town of 1,400 people 45 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee, along Interstate 55. It is a hard-hit rural community, home to a school with the dubious distinction of being among the worst-performing schools in the nation. In 2007, the IRS froze the town's bank accounts for not paying payroll taxes. A railroad track cuts through the middle of town. Even to this day, blacks largely live on one side of the track; whites on the other side.  See the hard-scrabble life of a slave's grandson » . Dowden is a living testament to a life of struggle, sacrifice and ultimately success. When she was 10 years old, her mom cooked a dewberry pie after working the cotton fields all day. She then went to a friend's house and died. ""It was real devastating,"" Dowden says softly. ""I was 10. My sister was 12, and we didn't know how to do nothing. And we had to take care of our little brother."" She missed one year of schooling because her father, Moses Wilson, couldn't afford schoolbooks. He died four days after she turned 18. She had two photos of her parents, but they were lost over the years. She knows even less about her grandparents. ""All I know is, he said that his momma was sold. She was auctioned off,"" Dowden says. ""I don't know where she was from. I don't know anything about her."" Dowden is a mother of 12. One son died when he was 3; another died when he was 47. ""It was hard both ways."" Across town, a group of African-Americans have gathered at Cistern Hill Church to talk about the good times and the hard times -- and hope for a better future. They range in age from 74 to 18.  Watch ""I started working when I was 6 years old"" » . Aubrey ""Bill"" Turner, 26, perks up when talking about Obama. ""He's going to bring a sense of respect in Mississippi, that it's not just a white man's country. You can be young, you can be black, and you can do anything that you want to do,"" Turner says. ""You do have a chance. And he's gonna put that all on the table for us."" Turner has a tattoo across his neck that reads ""Mr. Ssippi."" His grandfather was well-known fife musician Otha Turner, whose music was featured in the movie ""Gangs of New York."" His grandfather, he said, always taught him ""to respect white people, because one day you're gonna want that respect, too."" Others nod with excitement about the prospects of a black president. They point out that they've supported white presidents over the years and always voted for them. ""It just happened to be a black man [this time] that was qualified to be president and enough people wanted him in that position and voted for him,"" says William C. Wilbourn, 59. But Wilbourn acknowledges, as a black man, it's an awesome moment in the nation's history. ""It feels real good."" Elnora Jackson, 74, says she was robbed of the privilege to vote for decades. So whenever there's an election, she votes ""every time I get a chance."" Those gathered here chuckle when they talk about the town of Como. It was, they say, always a bit different than the rest of Mississippi. The downtown strip was built in such a way that there weren't really any back doors. Blacks could walk in the front doors of businesses in the old days. That's not to say it was a honeymoon, either. There was a white water fountain in town that was guarded; blacks could cook at a burger stand, but they couldn't buy food there. School buses with white kids would pass black children walking to and from school. They'd hurl bricks and insults at them. ""When I was growing up, it was painful,"" says Arilla Kerney, 63. ""I prayed and asked the Lord to forgive them."" There's one day that all the elders remember well. It was in June 1966. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. swung through Como on a march through Mississippi to motivate black people to register to vote. Black children had been told to stay away for fear of any reprisals. But Lucy Thomas, a 4-foot, 8-inch woman with a ""small frame and big voice,"" gathered about 20 black children. They walked hand-in-hand, barefoot and dirty, down the road to the intersection of Highways 51 and 310, where King and the Freedom Marchers were huddled. Descendant of slave owners crosses the tracks . One by one, the children shook King's hand. ""It was just amazing to see Dr. King come through Como, Mississippi!"" says Dorothy Kerney-Wilbourn, who was among the children that day. She says that about 20 miles down the road, there was a peach orchard where white men were up in trees with guns. ""We were walking down the highway, marching and singing freedom songs, and they were up in trees with guns. That was a frightening moment,"" Kerney-Wilbourn says with a laugh. ""Their concept of the blacks was just so different. But we showed them that we were there for peace."" Mary Dowden remembers that day, too. She said a white man said to her, ""They should send all the black boys back to Africa."" Dowden got in the man's face. ""I told him, 'You can't send me back to Africa, because I didn't come from Africa! I was born and raised here. Where you gonna send me back to?' "" She smiles. ""He didn't like that. ... He didn't say nothing. He shut his mouth up."" Obama has helped change the conversation in these parts like few others. Dowden, the granddaughter of a slave, holds her chin high. Referring to Obama, she says, ""It's his time."" He hasn't taken office yet, but he's already brought change. ""Right now, I think the white and black is coming together.""","Mary Dowden, 80, is the granddaughter of a slave .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Strange lights in the sky, mysterious flashes, dozens of witnesses, a missing wind turbine blade and a tabloid splash featuring the pun: E.T. farm harm. The Sun tabloid newspaper's UFO splash. Let's hope there isn't intelligent life out there watching us. Britain's tabloid Sun newspaper Thursday proclaimed from its front page that a wind turbine was ruined after a UFO hit one of its 20 meter-long blades in Conisholme, Lincolnshire. Dorothy Willows, who lives near the damaged turbine, told The Sun she was in her car when she saw strange lights in the sky. ""The lights were moving across the sky towards the wind farm. Then I saw a low flying object. It was skimming across the sky towards the turbines."" Apparently, hours later, she and her husband were woken by a big bang; one of the turbine's three blades had gone. It, was, however, on the ground below. Other locals told the newspaper that the lights looked like ""balls of flames."" Russ Kellett, a UFO expert, told the newspaper: ""Balls of light were seen in the sky and the MoD [Ministry of Defence] has no explanation. It must have taken a pretty massive object. We are very, very, very excited."" However, The Guardian newspaper's Web site content director Emily Bell had a simple explanation for all those ""balls of light"" in the sky. She told The Guardian the lights were fireworks her brother Tim had bought at the local garden center for the 80th birthday party of dad Peter Bell. ""It was a medium-sized fireworks display with absolutely no ballistics, and the fireworks were mostly dropping over my parents' house. But we were laughing that we could have broken the wind turbine,"" Emily said. ""There we are in the middle of a scoop and we're beaten to it by a red-top tabloid,"" Emily's mother Bridget, 74, told The Guardian. Later Thursday, the British Press Association reported the blade may have come off after a mechanical failure. Fraser McLachlan, chief executive of GCube, which insures more than 25,000 wind turbines worldwide, told PA that although it was unusual, this kind of incident happened up to six times a year. ""It does happen that a blade will sometimes just come off a machine for one reason or another,"" he said. ""The main reason is the blade may shear. ""We don't normally see things like aircraft -- or UFOs -- hitting them. It's usually a mechanical failure that causes the blade to separate from the main hub."" He said the cold weather was another possible cause. Dr Peter Schubel, an expert in the design and manufacture of wind turbine blades at the University of Nottingham, agreed. He told the BBC that if the turbine blade was still, it would take a 10-tonne load to remove a blade, but if it was rotating the force could be a lot less. ""It's definitely not a bird. It could be ice thrown from a neighbouring turbine that struck it."" Aliens out of control or simple mechanical failure? A case for Mulder and Scully? What do you think?","British tabloid blames UFO for destroying wind turbine blade .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The first photos of Tiger Woods cradling his new baby boy have been released amid speculation the injured world number one could announce a return to competitive golf ""any day now."" Tiger Woods poses with his family including new son Charlie and dogs Yogi and Taz. Charlie Axel Woods was born on Sunday, February 8, and is the second child for Woods and his wife Elin. He is pictured here with his 20-month-old sister Sam their dogs Yogi and Taz, who is seen planting a well-timed lick on Tiger's face. Woods had been waiting for the birth of his second child before making public any decision about a return to the Tour in 2009. His long-time caddie Steve Williams told Television New Zealand an announcement could come ""any day now,"" and that Woods could return to competitive golf ""in the next few weeks."" ""He's probably 95 percent of the way there. He was waiting for the birth of his second child which came about last week so he's ready to go, just needs a little bit more walking,"" Williams told TVNZ. ""He hasn't been able to walk too well. But anytime in the next few weeks he's going to tee it up."" Williams said Woods ""definitely"" wants to play a couple of tournaments before the U.S. Masters at Augusta in early April. The world number one has been out of the game since winning his 14th major title at the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines last June. He underwent reconstructive surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and a week later ruled himself out for the rest of the 2008 season. Williams told TVNZ that Tiger had been practicing six hours a day, and that the only concession he has made to his injury was to adjust his swing. ""He's had to modify his swing a little bit to accommodate his knee but the guy always finds a way,"" Williams said. He added: ""Nine months out of the game after a major operation is a long time. But he's a hell of a competitor and one of the best we've ever seen in this game so I would suspect that he'll carry right on, but time will tell that."" Last month, Woods issued a statement saying that he was practicing and making progress towards at a return to the PGA tour. He said after January 1, he started hitting longer irons and his driver, although was not swinging as hard as he could, adding ""I'm working towards that goal."" Earlier this month he predicted the new addition to the family would make it a ""hectic Spring"" and said that he'd be taking it ""tournament-to-tournament.""","Golfing legend Tiger Woods poses with his family, including new son Charlie .

"(CNN)  -- At least 23 people died Saturday when a protest rally turned violent outside Madagascar's Presidential Palace, a fire official at the main hospital said. People duck to avoid gunfire Saturday in Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. The official said 83 people were injured during the demonstration in the capital city of Antananarivo, according to journalist Dregoire Pourtier, who passed the information to CNN. The International Committee of the Red Cross helped at least 18 injured people, press officer Mbola Ramamanana said. Brittany Martin, an American who is a Harvard Fellow and lives near the palace, said she could hear the crowd cheering amid intermittent gunshots and noises that may have been tear gas canisters. iReport.com: Are you there? ""From the window I can see military cars and ambulances driving by,"" Martin said. ""Nothing is up in smoke. We know there have been people killed from French and Malagasy news reports. ""We can see the back of the president's palace. This morning was totally peaceful. We knew that Andry [Rajoelina] was unveiling his new government at the May 13th Plaza, which was peaceful,"" she said, citing a friend who was there. Madagascar's government is in flux. President Marc Ravalomanana fired Rajoelina as mayor of Antananarivo and put someone else in the job, but Rajoelina is still technically mayor and claims to head a transitional national government. Martin said she heard gunshots starting about 2 p.m., after the protesters marched from the plaza to the palace. She said it was unclear where the shots were coming from. Some media reports blamed foreign mercenaries for the shootings; others said army guards were responsible or that the army was firing at the mercenaries to protect the crowd. Violence in Madagascar began January 26, when protesters stormed state-run television and radio stations in Antananarivo. Hours earlier, the government had shut down a radio station owned by Rajoelina and, weeks before, had similarly shut down Rajoelina's television station after it aired an interview with ex-President Didier Ratsiraka. Ravalomanana took power in 2001 after ousting Ratsiraka in a tense, hotly contested election. Ratsiraka fled to France afterward. Loyalists blame Ratsiraka's family members for inciting the recent trouble. There is also anger in Madagascar -- where the World Bank says the average person earns about $320 a year -- over reports that Ravalomanana recently bought a $60 million airplane. Last Saturday, Rajoelina took to the streets, declaring himself the nation's leader after a week of violence and looting that killed at least 80 people and wounded more than 300. Rajoelina urged supporters to demand the resignation of Ravalomanana and said he planned to take charge until a transition government can be established in the island nation off Africa's southeastern coast.  Map » . ""What we've been pushing for is dialogue the whole time,"" said Rodney Ford, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy. He said he received reports that palace guards used tear gas and shot into the air to try to disperse the crowd. ""I don't think anyone wanted violence."" According to the U.S. State Department, Madagascar has about 20 million people with ethnic origins in Africa and Asia. It was administered by the British Empire during much of the 19th century until it came under the control of France, from which it gained independence in 1960.","Gunfire heard near presidential palace, site of anti-government rally .

"(CNN) -- An Indiana judge Monday froze the assets of Marcus Schrenker, a suburban Indianapolis financial manager who authorities say tried to fake his own death by crashing his private plane into a Florida swamp. Marcus Schrenker exited his small plane before it crashed, and investigators are looking for him, police say. Investigators looking into his business dealings for possible securities violations requested the temporary restraining order in Hamilton County Superior Court, said Jim Gavin, spokesman for the Indiana Secretary of State. He said the order, which also applies to Schrenker's wife, Michelle, and to his three companies, is aimed at protecting investors, and is related to a receivership filing. He didn't elaborate. Heritage Wealth Management, Heritage Insurance Services and Icon Wealth Management are ""the subjects of an active investigation by the Indiana Securities Division,"" Gavin said. Public documents list Schrenker as president of Heritage Wealth Management in Fishers, Indiana. A search warrant related to the inquiry was served December 31, Gavin said. According to The Herald Bulletin in Anderson, Indiana, Michelle Schrenker filed for divorce in Hamilton Superior Court on December 30. A hearing was set for February 5. Schrenker, 38, took off alone Sunday night in a corporate plane, a Piper PA-46, from Anderson, Indiana, en route to Destin, Florida. Authorities said the Fisher, Indiana, businessman parachuted to the ground before letting the plane crash in the Florida panhandle. The craft came down near the Blackwater River, only 50 to 75 yards from homes, said Sgt. Scott Haines of the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office.  Watch more about the mysterious flight » . ""It is a neighborhood -- some very nice waterfront property,"" he said. Military aircraft from Whiting Field, which were dispatched to intercept the plane after Schrenker reported an emergency, witnessed the crash about 9:15 p.m. CT. The crews fired flares and noticed the plane's door was open and the cockpit was dark, Haines said in a news release. They got no response. Haines said the plane appeared to have been put on autopilot at around 2,000 feet, over the Birmingham, Alabama, area, before the pilot parachuted to the ground. Schrenker had contacted air traffic controllers, saying that the windshield imploded. ""The pilot stated that he was bleeding profusely,"" the news release said. ""Radio contact with the plane was not able to be established after that point. When deputies located the plane at the crash site, no blood was present and the door to the plane was open."" The Childersburg, Alabama, Police Department reported that Schrenker approached one of its officers shortly before 2:30 a.m., ""and said that he had been in a canoeing accident with some friends,"" a news release said. Childersburg is about 35 miles southeast of Birmingham. Childersburg officers, unaware of the plane crash, took Schrenker to a hotel in nearby Harpersville. After hearing about the crash, they went back to the hotel, where they found that Schrenker had checked into the hotel under a fictitious name. ""When authorities entered Schrenker's room, he was not there,"" the release said. Authorities said Schrenker checked in under a fake name, put on a black cap and fled into a wooded area. Hotel manager Yogi Patel, who identified Schrenker on surveillance video, told CNN that Schrenker was the only guest overnight. He signed in as Jason Galouzs of Bolingbrook, Illinois, Patel said. A hotel employee said Schrenker went up to his room, but didn't enter before leaving the building. iReport.com: Are you near the crash site? Tell us about it . Steve Darlington, manager of Anderson Municipal Airport, told CNN the plane was in fine condition at takeoff, and said Schrenker is ""an accomplished pilot"" who owns ""a couple of airplanes"" and flies regularly. No agency has come forward to lead the probe. ""The FBI is looking into the matter, along with other agencies,"" said Paul Draymond, of the Birmingham FBI office. Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said several factors indicated the pilot likely left the plane before the crash: a ""detailed review of radar data,"" the fact that the plane was switched to autopilot before it crashed, the sighting by military jet crews and the fact that the cockpit was found mostly intact with no one inside. After the pilot alerted air traffic controllers about the alleged problems with his plane, authorities tried to persuade him to land in Pell City, Alabama, east of Birmingham, Haines said. Schrenker also flew an acrobatic plane, and made a video featured on a YouTube site. A message preceding the video warns, ""No pilot should attempt this stunt. You will get yourself killed. Pilot specially trained to fly unlimited acrobatics and shows."" CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","Authorities say pilot tried to fake his own death by crashing his private plane .

"(CNN) -- Lights went off across the world Saturday as millions of homes and businesses went dark for one hour in a symbolic gesture highlighting concerns over climate change. The lights go off Saturday at the Houses of Parliament and the Big Ben clock tower in central London. More than 2,800 cities and towns worldwide dimmed their lights at 8:30 p.m. local time for the third annual Earth Hour -- a day-long energy-saving marathon spanning 83 countries and 24 time zones. In New York, the Empire State Building, Central Park and the George Washington Bridge went dark at 8:30 p.m. ET. The Philippines topped this year's participation for Asia, with more than 650 communities taking part in the event, according to Earth Hour's Web site. The light illuminating the face of the landmark Big Ben clock tower in London, England, went out at 8:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET). In Dubai, iReporter Sharad Agarwal turned out the lights and sat down to a candlelit dinner with his family. ""I personally believe in going green and everything that goes with it,"" Agarwal told CNN. In Australia, floodlights of the Sydney Opera House were extinguished as the city's iconic harbor kicked off events for Earth Hour. The event's Web site reported that hundreds of people lined the harbor for a glimpse of the dimming skyline at 8:30 pm. Sydney became the birthplace of the Earth Hour campaign in 2007 when 2.2 million turned off their lights, igniting a grass-roots movement that has become a global phenomenon. In China, illuminations at major buildings including the ""Bird's Nest"" Olympic Stadium and the Water Cube were extinguished as 20 cities joined in, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Other landmarks around the world expected to join the World Wildlife Fund-sponsored event were the Egyptian pyramids, Vatican, Niagara Falls, the Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building, the Acropolis in Athens and the Las Vegas casino strip. CNN iReporter Marie Sager of Los Angeles, California, said she planned to hike up to the Griffith Observatory to experience the massive lights-out event. ""A good portion of the city is participating. We'll see the Capital Records sign go out. A lot of these places haven't turned out their lights in awhile,"" Sager said. Event sponsors hoped participating U.S. cities would set an example for the rest of the world.  Watch actor Edward Norton and Carter Roberts of the World Wildlife Fund discuss event » . ""We think we are going to have 100 million people around the world sending a message that climate change is real, and we need to take action now,"" World Wildlife Fund CEO Carter Roberts told CNN. ""The world is watching to see what America is going to do,"" he said, ""because if America acts on climate change, the world will follow."" Earth Hour events got off to an unofficial start in the remote Chatham Islands in the southern Pacific Ocean where locals switched off their diesel generators, organizers said. Shortly afterward, 44 New Zealand cities and town joined in the event. Organizers say they hope this year's event will send a message to world leaders meeting Copenhagen, Denmark, in December for a major summit on climate change. ""We are asking one billion people to take part in what is essentially the first global vote for action on climate change by turning off their lights for one hour and casting a vote for earth,"" said executive director Andy Ridley.","Lights go out over Sydney Harbor as city launches Earth Hour .

"(CNN)  -- Mount Redoubt volcano in southern Alaska erupted four times on Friday, shooting ash as high as 51,000 feet, scientists said. A series of eruptions has been rattling Alaska's Mount Redoubt volcano since Sunday. The latest eruption took place at 8:30 p.m. (12:30 a.m. Saturday ET), according to the National Weather Service. That eruption followed three other ones earlier Friday. The eruptions are the latest in a series that began Sunday. The Alaska Volcano Observatory said the alert level remains at its highest possible designation -- red -- indicating that an eruption is under way or imminent and that the eruption will produce a ""significant emission of volcanic ash into the atmosphere."" The weather service said the ash is drifting north and northeast. However, only ""very light"" amounts are expected to fall Friday in the Anchorage area, about 100 miles east-northeast of the volcano. Alaska Airlines limited flights to and from Anchorage on Friday, according to the airline's Web site. It canceled all its Thursday flights to and from Anchorage after an eruption earlier in the day sent an ash cloud 65,000 feet high.","NEW: Four eruptions jolt Alaska's Mount Redoubt on Friday .

"(CNN)  -- Mother Nature provided a little bit of everything in several parts of the country on Saturday. Vehicles jam a buckled road in Mobile, Alabama, on Saturday after heavy rains. Heavy winds wreaked havoc on a shopping center in central Tennessee, blowing out windows and damaging the roof, Murfreesboro police spokesman Kyle Evans told CNN Radio. Glass storefronts at the Jackson Heights Shopping Center were blown out 100 to 150 yards into the parking lot, Evans said. Evans said three people were treated for minor injuries from flying glass and metal. Residents in northwest Murfreesboro lost power Saturday night and police warned residents to stay indoors until traffic caused by the incident cleared up. Elsewhere, a blizzard dumped more than 2 feet of snow in parts of the Plains on Saturday. The blizzard cut power, stranding drivers and prompting governors in Kansas and Oklahoma to issue disaster declarations. The heaviest snow and ice accumulated in south central and southwest Kansas. In Pratt County, 28 inches of snow fell, with snowdrifts reported up to 6 feet deep. At least nine other counties reported 2 feet of snow, the Kansas Adjutant General's office said. About 17,000 customers in Kansas lost electricity, more than half of those in Sedgwick County. The storm left some travelers stranded and in need of last-minute hotel accommodations, according to the front desk manager at the Econolodge in McPherson. ""We have two honeymoon suites open, but other than that we're fully booked. We normally have 84 rooms,"" iReporter Sally Kelley said. The housekeepers who made it to work were all outside shoveling, but they struggled to keep up with the snow as it continued falling Saturday afternoon. ""We haven't had people getting mad at us. The people have been great but I think they're really frustrated."" The state Adjutant General's office said whiteout conditions and blowing snow made driving hazardous. The Kansas Department of Transportation shut down several roads in the western and south central part of the state. National Guard Humvees were used to move medical personnel and patients to a hospital in Seward County. In Oklahoma, where more than a foot of snow fell, Gov. Brad Henry declared a state of emergency in 50 counties. The state Department of Transportation had several roads blocked in the state and others remained impassable. ""The only people who can get out of their driveways have 4-wheel drive,"" said iReporter Mark Rennie of Alva, Oklahoma. Meanwhile, rain along the Gulf Coast battered areas around Mobile, Alabama, and Biloxi, Mississippi.  Watch how the rain is blocking roads in Mobile, Alabama » . Mobile County Emergency Management Director Walter Dickerson said 4 to 6 inches of rain fell on already saturated ground. Fifteen to 20 roads around Mobile were closed, and  several people had to be rescued after flash flooding trapped their cars. In Mobile, heavy rains caused a section of roadway to collapse. Three cars ended up in a large sinkhole, including one vehicle that landed on top of another. No serious injuries were reported. Dickerson said a temporary shelter may be opened for residents displaced by the high waters. In nearby Baldwin County, Alabama, an apartment complex was evacuated and some main roads were closed. The main roadway leading into Biloxi, the Interstate 10 loop, was closed for several hours early Saturday before waters receded and allowed traffic to resume. But more than a dozen other roads around Harrison County remained blocked. Roads were also impassable in some parts of the Florida Panhandle. Officials in the Atlanta, Georgia, metro area, which was under flood watches and warnings, were keeping an eye on surging rivers and creeks.","Strong winds damage Tennessee shopping center .

"MALMO, Sweden (CNN) -- The breathy vocals of Nina Persson helped launch The Cardigans onto the music scene in the 1990s. The band developed its dreamy pop sound in the Southern Swedish town of Malmo. Singer Nina Persson finds musical inspiration in love and relationships. They were catapulted to international success in 1997, when the single ""Lovefool"" appeared on the soundtrack for ""Romeo and Juliet,"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. The song's chorus (""Love me, love me, say that you love me"") became a pop anthem. In addition to fronting The Cardigans, Persson, 34, has worked on solo projects under the name A Camp. Now, after a near decade long hiatus, her second A Camp album, ""Colonia,"" is due out later this month. Persson, who splits her time between New York and Malmo, talks to CNN's ""My City, My Life"" about music, inspiration and life after ""Lovefool."" CNN: How did The Cardigans start? Nina Persson: We formed the band in this town where we are all originally from -- Jonkoping -- and that was in 1992. Magnus and Peter were the two guys who actually met and wanted to form the band. And then they recruited people and I was one of the first to be recruited, along with a friend of mine who played guitar in the first version of The Cardigans. I had not sung before that really. I was sort of hired because they knew they wanted a girl singing. And I was like 'I'm a girl' and I guess we got along well and I was willing to learn to sing. So that's how it started really.  Watch Nina take CNN on a tour of her favorite Malmo spots » . CNN: How big was music in your life before you joined the band? Nina Persson: I've loved music my whole life. But I never really listened to a record and thought that was something that I wanted to do. I was interested in becoming a painter, an architect, a designer. Those are the things I was interested in. But music, I never took instrument classes -- it was a random thing to start doing. CNN: Sometime a career finds you? Nina Persson: Yeah and I was a person who was really helped by it. I was looking for something but I didn't know what it was and it proved to fulfill what I needed at the time. CNN: How is A Camp different from The Cardigans? Nina Persson: It's hard to say what makes it different because I'm still doing the same thing -- I'm still writing songs and singing them -- but it feels like it's a bigger freedom because I am in charge in A Camp. I like both. Both serve good purposes. I like to be in the collective, being part of the machinery, but I also really enjoy being dictator. CNN: How do you define yourself as a musician now? Nina Persson: Well I'm not. I'm not one of these people who live and breathe music. In the beginning I was a reluctant musician -- I still haven't bothered to learn an instrument. I'm still only a singer and that's how I write my songs. I'm always superstitious that if I do learn an instrument I would pop the bubble a bit. CNN: Is there anything else you would have liked to have done if you hadn't done singing? Nina Persson: At the time when I was found, picked up by the band, I was into art. I was really good at drawing, really creative. I made stuff, I built stuff, I sewed stuff. I thought I would end up in that world somewhere. Photography was a big thing for me. In retrospect, I'm sure that could have been a good career for me. But recently I've started to wish that I could start over and dedicate my life to medicine. I would have loved to go to med school. I don't think I will because I don't want to spend seven or eight years in training, but I dream about working in a hospital. CNN: What were your inspirations over the years? Nina Persson: That's an incredibly difficult question to answer, but I think I'm a sucker for constantly going back to the subject of love and relationships. It also varies very much from project to project and month to month. I'm very emotional when it comes to the music. I want to make people cry. CNN: Tell us the story of how the band ended up in Malmo.  See photos of Nina in Malmo » . Nina Persson: We moved here because we started to record in Tambourine Studios which was here. Most studios are in Stockholm so sort of all roads wanted to drag us to Stockholm but we did persist and came here. CNN: When you came to Malmo, what was it like starting out in the early days? Nina Persson: Our parents helped us move down here which was really sweet. They sort of dropped us off and waved goodbye and we moved in. We really did hang out, the five of us, quite exclusively in the beginning. CNN: What was the area like back then? Has it changed? Nina Persson: Well actually the area where I now live hasn't changed that much. A lot of Malmo has moved away from the blue collar past it has, but not that area. It has strangely remained the same, and I like it. CNN: Do you think the gritty atmosphere of Malmo has helped you stay grounded? Nina Persson: Well it's hard to say how much has to do with the people we are or how much to do with Malmo. But there certainly is something here that does not encourage big headedness. CNN: The musical heritage of Malmo is quite rocky. How did you guys fit in? Nina Persson: People thought we were really ridiculous when we came to this totally rock place and played pop music. So we didn't fit in at all -- we were never part of the scene here. CNN: You were happy to be outsiders of the rocky heritage? Nina Persson: I think we felt sort of cool about doing our own thing. We thought we knew something that the others didn't understand. CNN: Is there something about Malmo that helps shape your music or influence you? Nina Persson: I think Malmo did have a big influence on us. Obviously we came here for the sound, and we got the sound we wanted. We were away from the industry -- that was great for us. I really did appreciate being in a place where there is not a lot whole of press and industry. Nina takes . CNN: So you also live in New York. What brings you back to Malmo? Nina Persson: For me, I love Malmo very much because of my friendships. In Malmo I get the intimacy and get to run into my friends in the street once in a while which is a lovely feeling and I get to have a great grocery store just around the corner. CNN: If Malmo was a person, what kind of person would it be? Nina Persson: It would be somebody who has been around for a while and survived a lot of hardships -- somebody you don't mess with, somebody really intelligent, stubborn, with a lot of beauty on the inside.","Cardigans' singer discusses Malmo, the group's adopted hometown .

"(CNN)  -- A fishing boat carrying two NFL players and two other men capsized last month because it was improperly anchored, a Florida agency reported Friday. Nick Schuyler clings to an overturned boat in this Coast Guard photo. One man survived; the other three are still missing. Oakland Raiders linebacker Marquis Cooper, NFL free agent Corey Smith and former University of South Florida players William Bleakley and Nick Schuyler went overboard February 28 during a fishing trip. Schuyler survived the accident, which happened 35 miles west of St. Petersburg, Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said the men were unable to pull up the anchor of their boat to head back to port. Cooper tried to rev the boat forward to free the anchor, but the 21-foot single engine craft then capsized. The report said that the ""improper anchoring"" to a portside bracket, the attempt to throttle the boat forward to release the anchor,and the ""failure to leave enough slack anchor line to compensate for top-water Gulf conditions"" caused the accident. Schuyler told his rescuers that the boat was anchored in the evening when it was overturned by waves during a storm. He told them that all four men were clinging to the boat for a time, but became separated. The four men embarked in a 21-foot single-engine boat from the Seminole Boat Ramp near Clearwater Pass about 6:30 a.m. February 28, the Coast Guard said.","Florida agency rules bad anchoring, revving engine made boat capsize .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Twenty-six year old Brazilian footballer Kaka is at the subject of negotiations about a salary that could see him earn nearly 95 times more than what Barack Obama will be paid when he enters the White House. Pay rise: Kaka could soon be earning $726,000 per week . Reports circulated Wednesday that the AC Milan midfielder is being offered a £500,000 ($726,000) per WEEK salary by English Premier League club Manchester City. A statement on Italy's Mediaset Web site appeared to suggest he will turn down the offer, however Manchester City officials insist the talks are ongoing. Even if he declines the move, the offer is far beyond the pay for many other high-profile jobs. For example, the U.S. President receives about $7690 per week, while British Prime Minister Gordon Brown receives around $5233. What do you think of these salaries?

The Brazilian, also with Manchester City, earns approximately $232,580 per week. Manchester City is owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, a man believed to be worth about $22 billion -- so funding the salary shouldn't be a problem.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The BBC is refusing to broadcast a plea from leading British charities for aid to Gaza, saying the ad would compromise the public broadcaster's appearance of impartiality. Demonstrators protest at the BBC's central London offices Saturday against the broadcaster's decision. The decision prompted weekend protests in England and Scotland, with one group saying Sunday that 100 people had occupied the foyer of the BBC building in Glasgow, Scotland and would not leave until the BBC runs the ad. The Disasters Emergency Committee, which includes the British Red Cross, Oxfam, Save the Children and 10 other charities, plans to launch the ad on Monday. British broadcasters, led by the BBC, originally declined to air the appeal -- but in the face of criticism from government ministers and others, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 changed their minds. CNN was not approached to broadcast the ad, a DEC spokesman said. About 5,000 people demonstrated in front of the BBC's Broadcasting House in central London on Saturday over the broadcaster's stance. Seven people were arrested.  Watch protest against BBC decision » . In Glasgow, the London-based Stop the War Coalition said Sunday its supporters had moved into the foyer of the BBC building in what the group described as a peaceful protest. The group did not plan to move beyond the foyer but intended to stay there until the BBC changes its decision, said Keith Boyd, a coalition member who called CNN on Sunday. ""Primarily we are asking that the ad be shown,"" Boyd said. The BBC press office would not confirm whether its Glasgow office was being occupied or if protesters were even there. ""We don't comment on individual demonstrations,"" a statement from the BBC press office said. The BBC is standing by its decision to not air the ad, director general Mark Thompson wrote in a blog post on the corporation's Web site. ""We concluded that we could not broadcast a free-standing appeal, no matter how carefully constructed, without running the risk of reducing public confidence in the BBC's impartiality in its wider coverage of the story,"" he wrote Saturday. ""Inevitably an appeal would use pictures which are the same or similar to those we would be using in our news programs but would do so with the objective of encouraging public donations. The danger for the BBC is that this could be interpreted as taking a political stance on an ongoing story,"" Thompson said. ""Gaza remains a major ongoing news story, in which humanitarian issues -- the suffering and distress of civilians and combatants on both sides of the conflict, the debate about who is responsible for causing it and what should be done about it -- are both at the heart of the story and contentious,"" he added. The BBC, which is funded by an obligatory license fee paid by every British household with a television, is required by its charter to be impartial. It does not carry commercial advertising but does broadcast charity appeals. The DEC is ""disappointed that the BBC declined to support the Gaza appeal,"" the spokesman told CNN. ""It might limit the reach of our key message to the general public."" The spokesman, who asked not to be named, said the BBC had to make its own decision about impartiality. ""That is a decision they must make. We have no view on that subject,"" he said. Many readers of Thompson's blog post did have a view, however. The statement got hundreds of comments, most of them critical of the BBC. A commenter who signed in as ""bully--baiter"" said the BBC was taking a side, no matter what it did. ""Sorry Mr. Thompson but you cannot have it both ways. If deciding to accede to the DEC request would be seen as political then deciding not to accede to it is also political. Don't insult me with your disingenuous attempts to suggest it is otherwise,"" the commenter wrote. Other commenters simply rejected Thompson's position out of hand. ""I think the reasons for blocking help for a grave humanitarian disaster are simply astounding,"" ""brit--proud"" wrote. ""How can simply bringing food, medicines and homes to hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians be seen as political impartiality? How stupid do the BBC think the British public are?"" But the corporation had its defenders as well. ""The last thing I want to do, is fund the BBC to broadcast propaganda,"" ""SternG"" wrote: ""There's no way I will pay the BBC to air the DEC's politically-motivated 'appeal' for Gaza. Gaza is run by a government which is internationally recognized as a terrorist group, including by the EU. There is no doubt that some aid/fund will be 'procured' by Hamas. ... Good decision BBC."" British broadcasters have refused to air some previous DEC appeals, the umbrella organization's spokesman said. A planned 2006 appeal for aid to victims of the war in Lebanon was scrapped because ""there were genuine concerns, shared by the aid agencies, about the deliverability of aid."" Thompson cited doubts about whether DEC members could get aid to Gaza as a secondary reason for declining to take the ad.","NEW: Protesters occupy part of BBC building in Scotland, group says .

"Men who are circumcised are less likely to get sexually transmitted infections such as genital herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), but not syphilis, according to a study of adult African men published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine. Circumcision rates have traditionally been higher in the U.S. than in Europe, but they've been on the decline. The finding adds to the evidence that there are health benefits to circumcision. It was already known that circumcision can reduce the risk of penile cancer, a relatively rare disease. In a previous study, the same research team found that adult circumcision could reduce the risk of HIV infection. Efforts to increase the practice of male circumcision in areas with high rates of sexually transmitted infections, including Africa, could have a tremendous benefit, say the study's authors. Genital herpes has been associated with an increased risk of HIV, and HPV can cause genital warts as well as a higher risk of anal, cervical (in women), and penile cancers. Health.com: Is your partner cheating? How to protect yourself . In the United States, infant circumcision is declining. About 64 percent of American male infants were circumcised in 1995, down from more than 90 percent in the 1970s. Rates tend to be higher in whites (81percent) than in blacks (65 percent) or Hispanics (54 percent). Some opponents say the removal of the foreskin is an unnecessary surgical procedure that may reduce sexual sensitivity in adulthood. In Jewish and Muslim cultures, young or infant boys are routinely circumcised for religious reasons. Circumcision rates have traditionally been higher in the U.S. than in Europe, but the American Academy of Pediatrics currently says that the medical benefits are insufficient to recommend circumcision for all baby boys. In the new study, a research team at the Rakai Health Sciences Program in Uganda -- in collaboration with researchers from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, and Makerere University in Uganda -- conducted two clinical trials involving 3,393 uncircumcised men ages 15 to 49. All the men were negative for HIV and genital herpes (also known as herpes simplex virus type 2); a subgroup of men also tested negative for HPV. Roughly half of the men underwent medically supervised circumcision at the start of the trial, while the other half were circumcised two years later. Overall, circumcision reduced the men's risk of genital herpes by 28 percent (10.3 percent of uncircumcised men developed genital herpes compared with 7.8 percent of circumcised men) and HPV infection by 35 percent (27.8 percent of uncircumcised men were infected with HPV compared with 18 percent of circumcised men). Circumcision did not, however, protect against syphilis. (About 2 percent of men in both groups contracted syphilis.) Health.com: A sexual risk taker comes to terms with drinking, depression, and STDs . Study coauthor Thomas C. Quinn, M.D., professor of global health at Johns Hopkins University, says that choosing circumcision, whether it's the parents of an infant or an adult male for himself, is and should remain an individual decision. ""But the critics need to really look at the benefits versus the risks,"" he adds. ""By now a large body of evidence has shown that the health benefits clearly outweigh the minor risk associated with the surgery. In our study, we didn't see any adverse effects or mutilation. We're recommending supervised, safe, sterile environments -- not circumcision out in an open field with rusty instruments."" Increasing circumcision rates in Africa may not only help men, but would likely protect women too, possibly lowering the rates of female cervical cancer, the authors say. Ronald H. Gray, M.D., professor of public health at Johns Hopkins University and study coauthor, says that the researchers plan to look at whether male circumcision reduces the transmission of HPV to female sexual partners. Health.com: 10 questions to ask a new partner before having sex . Even in the United States, this study has relevance, says Anthony Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which funded one of the trials). ""In this country, circumcision for infant boys remains a personal decision for the parents,"" he says. ""This makes us rethink whether doctors should be more aggressive in recommending that it at least be considered. If parents say no just because generations before them have said no, they should learn more about the significant health benefits before making that choice."" Roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults have had at least one HPV infection, according to an editorial by Matthew R. Golden, M.D., and Judith N. Wasserheit, M.D., both of the University of Washington. Although vaccines against some of the most dangerous HPV strains have been approved for girls ages 13 to 26, the vaccines are expensive and routine Pap tests are still necessary to pick up cervical cancers. Health.com: How to tell your ex you have an STD . Golden and Wasserheit note that ""rates of circumcision are declining and are lowest among black and Hispanic patients, groups in whom rates of HIV, herpes, and cervical cancer are disproportionately high."" Medicaid, which insures many low-income patients in these populations, does not pay for routine infant circumcision in 16 states. The study authors hope that this growing evidence in favor of circumcision will persuade policy-making bodies, both in the United States and in other countries, to officially recommend the procedure -- which could make patient education and insurance coverage more likely. It's not clear why circumcision may affect infection rates. But the study authors suggest that penile foreskin may provide a moist, favorable environment for herpes and HPV to survive and enter cells on the skin's surface.

"(CNN) -- Two leading Jewish watchdog groups are denouncing a prominent cartoonist's illustration about Israel's offensive in Gaza, saying it uses anti-Semitic imagery. The cartoon was published Wednesday in newspapers and on the Internet. The Anti-Defamation League, which has been fighting anti-Semitism since it was founded in 1913, called the syndicated cartoon by Pulitzer Prize-winning Pat Oliphant ""hideously anti-Semitic."" The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which, among other things, fights anti-Semitism and educates people about the Holocaust, said ""the cartoon mimics the venomous anti-Semitic propaganda of the Nazi and Soviet eras."" Published Wednesday in newspapers and on the Internet, the cartoon shows the small figure of a woman, labeled Gaza, carrying a child. She is being pursued by a headless, jackbooted figure wielding a sword, marching in an apparent goose-step and pushing a fanged Jewish star on a wheel. The Anti-Defamation League said the cartoon used ""Nazi-like imagery"" and a ""hateful evocation of the Star of David."" Abraham H. Foxman, the ADL's national director, said the cartoon's ""outlandish and offensive use of the Star of David in combination with Nazi-like imagery is hideously anti-Semitic."" ""It employs Nazi imagery by portraying Israel as a jack-booted, goose-stepping headless apparition,"" Foxman said. ""The implication is of an Israeli policy without a head or a heart. Israel's defensive military operation to protect the lives of its men, women and children who are being continuously bombarded by Hamas rocket attacks has been turned on its head to show the victims as heartless, headless aggressors."" The Wiesenthal Center, which also issued its statement Wednesday, said it urged The New York Times Web site and other Web sites to remove the cartoon. ""There is nothing about Oliphant's cartoon not meant to denigrate and demonize the Jewish state, from the headless goose-stepping soldier to the horrific depiction of the Star of David about to devour a cowering innocent Gazan woman holding a baby,"" Rabbi Marvin Hier, the group's dean, and Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the group's associate dean, said in a joint statement. ""The imagery in this cartoon mimics the venomous anti-Semitic propaganda of the Nazi and Soviet eras. It is cartoons like this that inspired millions of people to hate in the 1930's and help set the stage for the Nazi genocide,"" the statement said. A spokeswoman for Universal Press Syndicate, which distributes Oliphant's work, issued a statement defending him, saying he, ""like all editorial cartoonists, uses his art to comment on important issues of the day widely reported in the worldwide media -- in this case, the conflict over Gaza. That his cartoons sometimes spark intense debate is a testament to his talent."" Universal said no media outlet had informed the syndicate that it removed the cartoon, but ""Oliphant's clients are not contractually bound to inform us."" A New York Times spokeswoman said, ""We did not run the cartoon in the newspaper, nor do we plan to do so."" She said NYTimes.com has, by contract with uclick.com, an ""Oliphant"" button on the cartoons page. ""Yesterday, those who clicked on it saw the cartoon you mentioned, which is now relegated to the Oliphant archive,"" she said. Imagery and rhetoric comparing Israel to Nazis have been deployed by Israel's persistent critics, who decry the Jewish state's treatment of Palestinians as oppressive and brutal. Israel and its supporters defend the state as humane and say it has properly defended itself against attacks. There has been sharp criticism of Israel's offensive against Hamas militants in Gaza who launched rockets into southern Israeli towns. Human Rights Watch said Wednesday the Israeli military's firing of white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas during the offensive ""was indiscriminate and is evidence of war crimes,"" a claim denied by Israel. Israel has said that Hamas militants situated themselves among civilians during the offensive. Oliphant, who won the Pulitzer in 1967, has been a dominant figure in the editorial cartoon world. His work has been distributed since 1980 by Universal Press Syndicate, which calls the Australian native one of the ""sharpest, most daring practitioners"" among editorial cartoonists. He has received many honors, and his cartoons have been exhibited across the world. ""In 1998, the Library of Congress commemorated the acquisition of 60 of his works with a special exhibition at the Library's Great Hall,"" according to an Oliphant biography on the Universal Web site. This isn't the first time Oliphant's cartoons have drawn criticism. The American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in 2005 ""wrote to the San Francisco Chronicle and Universal Press Syndicate to communicate concern over racist depictions of Arabs,"" according to the group's Web site, and the Asian American Journalists Association criticized offensive stereotypes in cartoons in 1999, 2001 and 2007. Debates over offensive editorial cartoons are not uncommon. Keith Woods, dean of faculty at the Poynter Institute, a journalism school in St. Petersburg, Florida, was asked to comment on the reaction to the cartoon, whether the cartoon was improper, and at what point in the editorial process an editor can say a product has gone too far. He said he understands the positions the Jewish groups and Israeli policy critics bring to the table. He said he believes Oliphant is saying that ""Israel is behaving toward the Palestinians the way the Nazis behaved toward the Jews"" and that he is stating an opinion shared by many in the Middle East and the world. ""I believe that like the caricatures they are, editorial cartoons by their nature exaggerate their messages, so I don't think Oliphant is suggesting a one-to-one comparison. So I get the message, instead, that Israel is acting brutally toward the Palestinians."" He also believes the ADL and the Wiesenthal Center ""are saying that the cartoon is at least doing unintentional harm (if not more calculated harm)."" ""I see their point. There are symbols -- and the Nazi extermination of the Jews is surely one of them -- that can only truly be analogized to their equals. Unadulterated evil compared with unadulterated evil. Israel's ongoing battles with its Arab neighbors may be many things, but it is not The Final Solution."" As for the question of how news organizations should handle and discuss such a cartoon, Woods said that ""Oliphant clearly has the right to provoke or offend. The question for him is: Do you truly wish to conflate a complex, historic conflict with one of the most evil acts in history? And for the newspapers that carry the cartoon -- and their behavior here is equally open to critique -- do you wish to perpetuate such a comparison?""","NEW: Cartoon's distributor defends cartoonist, cites his talent to stir debate .

"(CNN) -- Prominent Chicago defense lawyer Ed Genson said Friday he intends to resign as attorney for embattled Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in the criminal case against the governor. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich's impeachment trial is scheduled to start on Monday. ""I never require a client to do what I say but I do require them to at least listen to what I say. ... I wish the governor good luck and godspeed,"" Genson said in brief remarks to reporters. Genson would not elaborate on his reasons for withdrawing from the case or any conversations he had with Blagojevich about his leaving the case. Genson had headed Blagojevich's defense team since soon after the governor was arrested on December 9 on federal corruption charges. Among other allegations, federal prosecutors said the governor tried to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by President Obama. Genson represented Blagojevich during proceedings in the Illinois state House in which legislators voted to impeach the governor. But on January 16, the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Illinois said Genson would not represent Blagojevich in his state Senate impeachment trial. No explanation was given. Blagojevich has denied any wrongdoing and said the House impeachment vote was politically motivated.  Watch Blagojevich ask for fair trial » . On Thursday, the outspoken Blagojevich called the Senate trial ""a sham"" and said the Senate is not allowing him to call witnesses in the trial, which is scheduled to begin Monday. The Chicago Tribune reported that Genson said his inability to call witnesses or to know the identities of some parties in alleged schemes made it impossible to defend Blagojevich in the impeachment trial. After Genson announced Friday he would leave Blagojevich's criminal defense effort, another of Blagojevich's attorneys, Sheldon Sorosky, said he was continuing to work on the case. ""I'm on the case, absolutely,"" Sorosky, whose law firm is separate from Genson's firm, said at an impromptu sidewalk news conference as he was leaving an office building. ""I was aware of Mr. Genson's position, and he's a good friend,"" said Sorosky.

"TROUTVILLE, Virginia (CNN) -- For the past year, Donna Chamberlain has worked at a fuel center here in Virginia's Roanoke Valley. It pays roughly half of what her old job did, but after being out of work for 14 months, she feels lucky to have it. Wachovia, which distributes the debit cards, would not comment on how much it receives for their use. Adding to her concerns, she and her husband, Steve, are now the custodial parents of their 7-year-old special-needs grandson, Cayden. The family needs every penny it can collect. So when state officials replaced the roughly $40-a-week child support check with a debit card, Donna read the fine print -- and left it on the table. ""It was automatically generated, and had my name on it,"" she told CNN. ""This thing had 10 fees."" Watch Chamberlain discuss the hidden fees . Virginia is one of two dozen states that use debit cards as one means of distributing child support payments, a move that allows them to reduce the amount of money spent issuing and mailing checks. But the fees attached to the debit cards can accumulate quickly: 50 cents to make a telephone balance inquiry; 65 cents to make an ATM withdrawal after two free withdrawals are taken; and $2.75 if the card is used at an out-of-network bank. Chamberlain found one charge particularly galling. North Carolina-based banking giant Wachovia, which distributes the funds on Virginia's behalf, said it would deduct $2.50 from her account for more than one face-to-face visit at one of its banks. ""If you should go to the bank teller window, you get to go once a month,"" she said. ""But if you want to talk to anybody about your money more than once a month, it's going to cost us $2.50 to walk in the door of the bank."" Wachovia would not comment on how much it receives from the program, and referred CNN to Virginia state officials. But with an increasing number of states turning to debit cards to distribute money for programs such as child support, the fees attached to those cards are drawing criticism from consumer advocates. ""These cards can come with hidden fees, subject to identify theft and unauthorized charges,"" said Lauren Saunders, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center in Washington. ""And, unlike a credit card, you don't get a regular statement, so you can't check on these charges. Some of them have gotchas like overdraft fees that are added on. So, there's dangers, and if these cards are structured unfairly, they can be a problem."" Many recipients aren't aware of the fees, even though they are usually sent a list of the charges along with a new debit card, Saunders said. Virginia allows child support recipients to receive payment via debit card, direct deposit or check. But it has been pushing the use of debit cards since 2006, said Nick Young, the head of Virginia's Department of Social Services. In 2008, approximately $279 million in child support payments were distributed via the Wachovia debit cards. Young told CNN that he had no idea how much money Wachovia made from debit card fees, but said most of them could be avoided with ""wise"" use of the cards. ""I will admit that if somebody takes their $300 out, $10 at a time, they will in essence defeat the purpose of the card,"" he told CNN. ""And they will suffer."" In 2008, about 52 percent of child support recipients used direct deposit, Young said. A little more than 41 percent chose debit cards. Only 1,877 people chose to get money by check last year in the state, he said. Virginia also uses debit cards to distribute state retiree payments, and it is one of 30 states to use them to pay unemployment benefits, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. In a CNN report on the practice earlier this month, the Labor Department said debit cards are safer and more secure than checks, allow the unemployed to avoid check-cashing fees and frees them from keeping excess cash around. In Pennsylvania, divorce attorney Susan E. Murray advises clients in her state to turn down the debit cards for child support. ""They will nickel-and-dime you to death,"" she said. ""If someone is getting $200 a month in child support, the fees really start cutting into their money."" The program is ""horrible"" for families, she said. ""It's a win for the state, it's a win for the bank, but the kids lose. Children are the losers under this program. It's unconscionable."" Back in Virginia, Chamberlain's debit card is still stuck to the letter the state sent to her home. She'll stick with a check, thank you.","Virginia is one of two dozen states that use debit cards to distribute child support .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The U.S. military says a recent raid uncovered a detailed letter from an al Qaeda in Iraq militant to the group's leader about how the insurgent network should continue to generate economic chaos and ""psychological conflict"" and must bear down against American-backed Sunni militias. An Iraqi mother and daughter are helped Tuesday after a car bombing in Baquba blamed on al Qaeda in Iraq. Maj. Gen. Kevin Bergner told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday about a letter to Abu Ayyub al-Masri, the head of al Qaeda in Iraq, from a militant named Abu Safyan. The document was posted on the Multi-National Forces-Iraq Web site. The sentiments reflect the tenacity of and continuing challenges posed by the predominantly Sunni militant network believed to be responsible for bombings that erupted across Iraq on Tuesday. Bergner said it ""provides further evidence about the strategy and tactics of violence"" the group is pursuing. Bergner said a March 5 raid northwest of Baghdad resulted in three insurgents killed, including Abu Safyan, and three others captured. Troops seized a suicide vest, computer material and a stack of documents, including the document from Abu Safyan -- who was believed to be from Diyala province. Abu Safyan lays out a variety of tactics that militants should pursue. ""We must always leave the enemy in psychological conflict"" so that ""they can never have stability,"" according to the document. With such instability, they ""will not all unite against us,"" it adds. Bergner said that while authorities are investigating Tuesday's bombings in Baghdad, Ramadi, Mosul, and Baquba that killed 60 people and wounded more than 100 others, the strikes have the ""hallmark"" of being perpetuated by al Qaeda in Iraq. The group has been considered the coalition's top foe in Iraq, even though troops have been distracted in recent weeks by fighting rogue Shiite militias. Al Qaeda in Iraq has been described by military officials as having a largely foreign leadership but made up of Iraqis. It is distinct from al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but it is not clear how closely both the Iraqi and the South Asian al Qaeda groups cooperate. The letter details the need for fostering ""security chaos"" among the anti-al Qaeda in Iraq and mostly Sunni awakening groups, Shiites and Kurds, the coalition forces, and the government. ""This will lead to weaken them, particularly the Maliki Shia government, by wisely, intelligently and cautiously spreading sedition among them,"" the letter said, referring to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. In the letter, Abu Safyan considers awakening groups a top threat to al Qaeda in Iraq and proposes a media campaign that would discredit the awakening forces by passing along false information about them. The jihadi says al Qaeda in Iraq militants should consider infiltrating the government and security forces to foster trust. That atmosphere would enable militants to conduct attacks, including strikes against Shiites. ""We will work against them and attack them as they fight among themselves,"" Abu Safyan is quoted as saying. Abu Safyan also calls for the disrupting the economy by attacking gas and oil fields, pipelines, tankers, electric stations and power lines. He suggests contaminating water lines and lakes. Such sabotage would serve to ""halt payment of the military and police salaries and the awakening movement associated with the occupier and Maliki's malignant government. Even the American Army will weaken since it depends on the Iraqi oil and gas wealth. The enemy will gradually drown step by step."" Abu Safyan talks about the need to ""bring many brothers who have sharia knowledge and abide by the teachings of Islam from the outside of Iraq."" ""They will explain to the people why we are fighting and whom we are fighting with, we must explain to them whom the mujahideen are and who are the people we're fighting."" The militant also called for good protection of communities under their control. ""We must dig trenches around the villages and cities to prevent the enemy from entering our areas,"" the document said. Abu Safyan also called for organizing fighting groups by having an emir as commander with sniper, assassination and martyrs' groups. It also cautions vigilance against allowing the ""enemy"" to infiltrate its apparatus and exhorts its fighters to keep silent about operations. Sometimes, ""they speak of our operations and area's secrets among their families and their wives in their houses, which unfortunately lead to the spread of our secrets.""

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Some of Zimbabwe's children are ""wasting away"" as political turmoil and economic crisis have caused a severe food shortage, according to a report from Save the Children. Children sleep in rough conditions on the border between Zimbabwe and South Africa. The number of acute child malnutrition cases has risen by almost two-thirds in the past year, the report from the UK-based agency said in its appeal to world donors for help. ""There is no excuse for failing to provide this food,"" program director Lynn Walker said. ""The innocent people of Zimbabwe should not be made to suffer for a political situation that is out of their control."" Five million Zimbabweans -- out of a population of about 12 million -- are in need of food aid now, the report said. The group is appealing for 18,000 tons of food for next month. ""We have already been forced to reduce the rations of emergency food we are delivering because there isn't enough to go around,"" the report said. ""If, as we fear, the food aid pipeline into Zimbabwe begins to fail in the new year the millions of people who rely on emergency food aid will suffer."" Zimbabwe is facing its worst economic and humanitarian crisis since its independence from Great Britain 28 years ago. There is an acute shortage of all essentials such as cash, fuel, medical drugs, electricity and food. President Robert Mugabe blames the crisis on the sanctions imposed on him and his cronies by the West for allegedly disregarding human rights. But Mugabe's critics attribute the crisis to his economic policies. As the economy has faltered for almost a decade now, a cholera epidemic is raging, fueled by the collapse of health, sanitation and water services in Zimbabwe. The epidemic has claimed more than 1,100 lives and infected more than 20,000 people since its outbreak in August. Health experts have warned that the water-borne disease could infect more than 60,000 unless its spread is halted. The political crisis rose to a boil in this year when the opposition party claimed that it won the presidential election, but Mugabe's government refused to recognize the result. Instead, the race was thrown to a runoff, which was boycotted by the opposition. Mugabe signed an agreement with the opposition in September to form a unity government, but a bitter dispute over the division of cabinet seats has prevented its formation. Inflation is so severe that the government was forced to print $10 billion currency notes last week, with each expected to buy just 20 loaves of bread.","Some Zimbabwean children ""wasting away"" amid food shortage, aid group says .

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Be forewarned, Ireland is seductive. Traditions are strong and stress is a foreign word. I fell in love with the friendliest land this side of Sicily. It all happened in a Gaeltacht. As you explore the lush Dingle Peninsula, you'll see how the Emerald Isle got its name. Gaeltachts are national parks for the traditional culture, where the government protects the old Irish ways. Shaded green on many maps, these regions brighten the west coast of the Emerald Isle. Gaeltacht means a place where Gaelic (or Irish) is spoken. But the Irish culture is more than just the language. You'll find it tilling the rocky fields, singing in the pubs, and lingering in the pride of the small-town preschool that brags ""All Gaelic."" The Dingle Peninsula -- green, rugged, and untouched -- is my favorite Gaeltacht. While the big tour buses clog the neighboring Ring of Kerry before heading east to kiss the Blarney Stone, in Dingle it still feels like the fish and the farm actually matter. Fishing boats still sail from Dingle, and a nostalgic whiff of peat scents its nighttime air, offering visitors an escape into pure Ireland. For 30 years my Irish dreams have been set here, on this sparse but lush peninsula where locals are fond of saying, ""The next parish is Boston."" Of the peninsula's 10,000 residents, 1,500 live in Dingle Town. Its few streets, lined with ramshackle but gaily painted shops and pubs, run up from a rain-stung harbor, home to a friendly dolphin. You'll see teenagers -- already working on ruddy beer-glow cheeks -- roll kegs up the streets and into the pubs in preparation for another night of music and craic (fun conversation and atmosphere). The Dingle Peninsula is worth exploring by bike or car. It's 10 miles wide and runs 40 miles from Tralee to Slea Head. The top of its mountainous spine is Mount Brandon, at 3,130 feet, the second-tallest mountain in Ireland. While only tiny villages lie west of Dingle Town, the peninsula is home to 500,000 sheep. The weather on this distant tip of Ireland is often misty, foggy, and rainy. But don't complain -- as locals will explain, there is no bad weather ... only inappropriate clothing. Leaving Dingle Town by car or bike, it becomes clear that the peninsula is an open-air museum. It's littered with monuments reminding visitors that the town has been the choice of Bronze Age settlers, Dark Age monks, English landlords, and Hollywood directors (""Ryan's Daughter,"" and ""Far and Away""). The Milestone B&B decorates its front yard not with a pink flamingo, but with an ancient pillar stone -- one of more than 2,000 stony pieces in the puzzle of prehistoric life here. Near the red, two-room schoolhouse, a street sign warns Taisteal go Mall -- Slow Down. Near the playground, students hide out in circular remains of a late Stone Age ring fort. In 500 B.C. it was a petty Celtic chieftain's headquarters, a stone-and-earth stockade filled with little stone houses. Many of these ring forts survived the centuries because of superstitious beliefs that they were ""fairy forts."" The wet sod of Dingle is soaked with medieval history. In the darkest depths of the Dark Ages, when literate life almost died in Europe, peace-loving, bookwormish monks fled the chaos of barbarian raids on the continent. They sailed to this drizzly fringe of the known world and lived their monastic lives in lonely stone igloos or ""beehive huts,"" which you'll see dotting the landscape. Several groups of these mysterious huts, called clochans, line the road. Built without mortar by seventh-century monks, these huts take you back. Climb into one. You're all alone, surrounded by dank mist and the realization that it was these monks who kept literacy alive in Europe. To give you an idea of their importance, Charlemagne, who ruled much of Europe in the year 800, imported Irish monks to be his scribes. Rounding Slea Head, the point in Europe closest to America, the rugged coastline offers smashing views of deadly black-rock cliffs and the distant Blasket Islands. The crashing surf races in like white horses, while longhaired sheep graze peacefully on the green hillside. Study the highest fields, untouched since the planting of 1845, when the potatoes never matured and rotted in the ground. The great famine of that year, through starvation or emigration, nearly halved Ireland's population. Because its endearing people have endured so much, Ireland is called ""The Terrible Beauty."" Take your time at the Gallaras Oratory, circa A.D. 800, the sightseeing highlight of your peninsula tour. One of Ireland's best-preserved early Christian churches, its shape is reminiscent of an upturned boat. Its watertight dry-stone walls have sheltered travelers and pilgrims for 1,200 years. From the Oratory, continue up the rugged one-lane road to the crest of the hill and then coast back to Dingle Town -- hungry, thirsty, and ready for a pint.

"ATLANTA, Georgia -- Going back to work after my wife had our first child was an emotional roller coaster. The author says that being ""Mr. Mom"" is appealing, but putting the idea into practice is harder than it looks. I forced myself out of bed, shaved my beard and got dressed on the morning of my return. I performed these work week rituals while cursing the fact that I matched only one number on my last lottery ticket, so I had to show up that day. After being out of the office for a little more than two weeks on paternity leave, I knew the transition back to work would be tough. I coped with this fact, like any rational new parent would, by increasing the number of lottery tickets that I purchased. Saying goodbye took a while. I made several trips up and down the stairs to get one more glimpse of my daughter before succumbing to the inevitable: my commute, fighting traffic and reintegrating to cubicle culture. I arrived at the office still thinking of my family at home without me. I found myself misty-eyed at the water cooler while I waited for Outlook to load several hundred unread e-mails. At that moment, I wanted nothing more than to be at home with my daughter. The idea of being a stay-at-home dad, like Michael Keaton in ""Mr. Mom,"" always appealed to me. For the uninitiated, the 1983 comedy is about an out-of-work father faced with domestic challenges while his wife gets a job. A memorable scene has the title character, Jack Butler, trying to sound like he knows what he's talking about to his wife's new boss. He tells him that he plans to wire a new wing of his house in ""220, 221, whatever it takes."" I identify with the latter part of his character's claim. It's not like me to pretend to know anything about home improvement, but when it comes to caring for my family while balancing my responsibilities at work, I plan on doing whatever it takes. In 2007, 37 percent of working dads admitted that they would leave their jobs if their family could afford it, according to CareerBuilder.com. The ""if"" in that statistic is a big one. Unlike the characters in ""Mr. Mom,"" my wife and I both need to work. A good sequel to this film may have explored the hijinks that ensued from an overwhelmed parent caring for a newborn while working from home. Nowadays, there's support for all of the Jack Butlers out there. Web sites such as AtHomeDad.org and Rebeldad.com have established online communities dedicated to providing tips and resources for fatherhood. These forums represent a growing fellowship where those with experience can help new dads. Personally, I haven't utilized them much yet because of that old Groucho Marx joke about not wanting to be a member of a club that would have a person like me as a member. Available resources and social acceptance for stay-at-home dads have come a long way since ""Mr. Mom's"" portrayal of them. In fact, Salary.com calculated that a stay-at-home dad was worth $125,340 a year for the dad portion of his work in 2006. This analysis took into account tasks that range from cooking and cleaning to teaching and serving as a child psychologist. Since I can't convince anyone to pay me my estimated worth as an at-home dad -- and living on one salary isn't an option for my family -- I've considered working from home a couple of hours a week when necessary. Flexible work schedules make sense because they benefit a company by allowing employees to be more productive on their terms. Nevertheless, working from home may not be for everyone. I work for a news Web site, facilitating advertisement opportunities. A lot of my job's communication occurs via e-mail, which is something I can do at home. I'd worked from home before, but not with a newborn in the house. My first test was only for a couple of hours when the baby was about 3 weeks old. My wife had an early appointment, and I was going to watch the baby sleep, hopefully, and then go into the office after she got home. I had e-mail to check and two conference calls scheduled back-to-back during that time. I didn't expect this to be too difficult. I caught up on the e-mail much earlier than if I had gone into the office that morning. Unfettered from the restriction of the morning rituals, my productivity was already soaring and I was ahead of schedule. Then disaster struck. As I called into my first meeting, the baby started to stir, squirm and make her signature sounds (a primal series of grunts, snorts and whimpers). She was telling me that her diaper needed to be changed and that she was probably hungry, too. So I did what any multi-tasker would do: I put the phone under my ear, stuck her bottle under the tap, muted the phone, ran up the stairs with her in a tucked football position, unmuted the phone, answered a question, muted again, changed her diaper and ran down the stairs to get the bottle. My wife called while I was juggling the baby, diaper, bottle and meeting to let me know that she was running late. I screamed to myself, ""I need help NOW!"" Allowing the nervous breakdown to run its course, I continued to pace across my living room floor -- regretting that I hadn't chosen decaf that morning. A few minutes later, I jumped out of the first meeting to call into the second. I said, ""Hello, this is Josh, I'm here on mute, OK, thanks."" As I listened in on mute, I shushed my baby to calm her -- to no avail. Her cries became increasingly louder. My boss asked, ""Josh, are you there?"" I unmuted my phone and right on cue, my daughter screamed at the top of her little lungs. The conference room on the other end of the phone erupted with laughter, and I told them that I'd have to get back to them. My wife arrived home shortly after the conference-call debacle. I told her that I didn't think it would be a good idea for me to work from home anymore. I realize that the ability to work and be a nanny simultaneously is a skill requiring practice. One trial run as a telecommuter with a newborn has caused me to question the feasibility of being able to do it on a regular basis. Perhaps it's time for me to forget about that old Groucho Marx joke and accept some help. Wait, the baby's crying, sorry, gotta go.","Poll: 37 percent of working dads would quit jobs if their families could afford it .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN)  -- Murder and justice have always been hallmarks of the ""Law & Order"" stable of TV shows, but never before have the fictional New York City crimes guided the show's detectives and attorneys to the United Nations -- until now. ""Law & Order: SVU"" co-star Christopher Meloni says the show's intent is to ""shine light in the dark places."" The U.N. recently opened the gates of its New York headquarters to the NBC Universal show ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" for the filming of an episode scheduled to air Tuesday. The taping marked the first time in its nearly 60-year history that the United Nations has allowed its iconic location to be used as a setting in a major network television production. Previously, the United Nations granted permission for the 2005 motion picture ""The Interpreter"" to film on location, making it the first feature film to shoot on the grounds of the U.N. Series stars Stephanie March, who plays Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cabot, and Christopher Meloni, along with nearly 200 other cast and crew members, came to the U.N. on March 7 to film an episode revolving around child soldiers, refugees, warlords and the International Criminal Court. ""Law & Order: SVU"" traditionally involves difficult subject matter such as kidnapping, rape and homicide. Emmy-nominated actor Meloni, who plays Detective Elliot Stabler on the show, explained that the intent behind the issues raised on the program has always been to ""shine light in the dark places that no one wants to go or talk about because there's usually a lot of shame and denial about it."" Meloni described how the U.N. episode ""really does kind of revolve around child soldiers, how they've been brainwashed, the horrible journeys that they've had to endure and how they can be assimilated back and be productive. And I think in this particular episode, we're trying to carry on with whatever clout we may possess. We have the medium to shine the light out there and tell this story."" Considering the ""ripped-from-the-headlines"" and complicated themes regarding conflict in Africa and the ICC, ""Special Victims Unit"" writers and actors relied on Enough Project co-founder John Prendergast as a consultant throughout the filming. The Enough Project is an advocacy group committed to preventing genocide, crimes against humanity and other atrocities in six historically tumultuous African nations. Prendergast explained that he perceived the episode as ""one where reality dovetailed quite neatly with fiction, and hopefully more people will understand now what is happening in real life with President Bashir and Sudan, and then the accountability for war crimes because they saw it on 'Law & Order.' "" On March 4, the International Criminal Court indicted Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, with war crimes and crimes against humanity. This was the first time such charges have been leveled against a sitting head of state. The ""Special Victims Unit"" filming was the first official project within Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's newly formed Creative Community Outreach Initiative. The intent of the program is to establish a relationship with international film and television industries to enhance the image of the United Nations and to ""raise the profile of critical global issues,"" according to a U.N. representative. Eric Falt, director of the U.N.'s outreach initiative, elaborated: ""We're starting a program where we're going to say to filmmakers, people who produce television series, that we are essentially open for business. You want to come to the U.N.? Talk to us. We'll make it happen."" In addition to the ""Law & Order"" film shoot, the United Nations has hosted two other high-profile events in March through the initiative. Celebrities and recording artists including Akon, Phylicia Rashad, Peter Buffet and Whoopi Goldberg commemorated victims of the of the trans-Atlantic slave trade March 25 with a concert in the U.N. General Assembly Hall. The show was directed by celebrated musician Nile Rodgers and was the first such event held at the United Nations. Goldberg also moderated a discussion March 17 at U.N. headquarters stemming from the complex topics presented in the popular television show ""Battlestar Galactica."" The panel featured series stars Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell, along with the series creators and assorted U.N. personnel speaking about a variety of subjects prevalent both in the show and in today's world. Topics included abortion, suicide bombings and post-conflict resolution. Goldberg summed up the purpose of the occasion, saying, ""much like the fictional ships and planets in the 'BSG' universe, the U.N. is an imperfect place, but the fight for justice, equality and understanding remains fundamental to both."" Despite the imperfections of the United Nations, ""SVU's"" March could not have been more thrilled with her experience filming at the U.N. When asked what she would like to be doing if she weren't putting away fictional bad guys as assistant DA Cabot, March said, ""I would love to work for the United Nations. I have a great job, but really all I want to do is actually work in the U.N. I'm pretty excited to be here. It's been a lifelong dream to be a part of it in some way."" The ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" episode is slated to air at 10 p.m. ET on Tuesday on NBC.","TV show is the first to film at U.N.'s New York headquarters .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to the Academy Awards, Hollywood has some biases. The late Heath Ledger won a Golden Globe for his performance as The Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" Summer blockbusters get short shrift. Comedies aren't taken seriously. And animated features? They almost never get drawn. Which, on the surface, doesn't bode well for three of the biggest movie stories of the year: ""The Dark Knight,"" Robert Downey Jr.'s performance in ""Tropic Thunder,"" and Pixar's latest marvel, ""WALL-E."" Each earned critical plaudits and box office success. And each faces an uphill struggle nabbing major-category Oscar nominations when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announces its shortlists Thursday morning. Awards expert Tom O'Neil, who follows the Oscars for the Los Angeles Times' TheEnvelope.com, says the best-picture front-runners are ""Frost/Nixon,"" ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" ""Milk"" and Golden Globe best drama winner ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Barring a completely out-of-the-box surprise, that leaves ""Dark Knight,"" ""The Reader,"" Clint Eastwood's fast-gaining ""Gran Torino"" and possibly ""Doubt"" or ""Revolutionary Road"" to battle for the final slot.  Watch who took home the Globes » . O'Neil believes ""Dark Knight,"" the year's top box office draw, has ""an excellent shot"" of making the best-picture list. ""We know that because Oscar voters belong to guilds that have their own awards, 'Dark Knight' has a strong chance,"" he says, noting that the Directors Guild, Producers Guild and Writers Guild have all nominated ""Dark Knight"" for their top awards. Read what EW's Dave Karger has to say about that . ""WALL-E,"" however, is almost certainly out of the best-picture race, he says. Animated features, no matter how successful, have fared poorly in general categories. Indeed, only one animated feature -- 1991's ""Beauty and the Beast"" -- has ever been nominated for best picture. With the addition of the best animated feature category in 2001, it's doubtful that even the best Pixar has to offer will cross over to best picture, particularly since the Academy ignored classics including ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Fantasia"" and ""Toy Story."" ""Oscar voters like reality,"" says O'Neil. Either way, the Oscars could probably use the ratings help a box office success can bring to its broadcast. In recent years, the Academy has nominated several independent or low-budget films for top awards, many of which didn't crack the $100 million mark at the box office. Oscar ratings have tumbled; last year's numbers for ""the Super Bowl for women"" -- as the Oscar broadcast is known by advertisers -- were the lowest on record and a far cry from 1998, when more than 55 million people watched all-time box office king ""Titanic"" take home the top prize. That's not to downgrade the expected front-runners, especially since the Oscars' intention is to honor some of the year's best films and performances (though critics have carped they've often not done so). Still, it might behoove the Academy to pay attention to box office as well as prestige, particularly when several films have garnered both. Almost three-quarters of the respondents to an unscientific USA Today Internet survey have said they'd be more likely to watch the Oscar ceremony February 22 if ""The Dark Knight"" is nominated for best picture. ""If a film is very successful, it shouldn't be automatically relegated to the minor leagues,"" producer Peter Guber told The Associated Press. (Ironically, Guber co-produced the 1989 ""Batman,"" which, despite big box office and Jack Nicholson's Joker, was nominated for just one Oscar -- for Anton Furst's set design. It won.) Historically, summer blockbusters haven't always been ignored. ""Jaws,"" considered the first of the modern summer blockbusters, was nominated for best picture, as were ""Star Wars,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Fugitive."" And there's something to be said for giving visibility to smaller films, says John Martin, president and CEO of Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas, an upscale theater chain based in Austin, Texas. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Oscar nominations . ""As an exhibitor, we would love to see those [smaller niche] films make it as well,"" he says. ""They would have legs [box office longevity] if nominated."" Martin, a former film executive, was pleased that ""Slumdog"" and ""The Wrestler"" -- two films his chain got behind -- fared so well at the Golden Globes, and he has high hopes for both films at the Oscars. ""The Wrestler's"" lead, Mickey Rourke, earned a Globe for best dramatic actor, and is now a leading candidate to win best actor at the Oscars. O'Neil sees Rourke as the front-runner in the category, which should be ""a real slugfest,"" he says. ""Milk's"" Sean Penn was considered the early leader, with his main competition ""Frost/Nixon's"" Frank Langella. But now Rourke is in the picture, which could mean trouble for Brad Pitt (""Benjamin Button""), Leonardo DiCaprio (""Revolutionary Road""), Clint Eastwood (""Gran Torino"") and Richard Jenkins (""The Visitor"").  Watch Eastwood talk about ""Gran Torino"" » . And Kate Winslet, a double winner at the Globes, could fall between the cracks in the Oscar balloting, O'Neil adds. Other awards let the performers or studios designate whether roles are leading or supporting; the Academy decides on its own, which means that Winslet's performances in ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""The Reader"" could split her support, whether for lead or supporting actress. Heath Ledger should have no such problems. The late actor, whose performance as The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" has been considered Oscar material since the film came out in July, is believed to be a shoo-in for best supporting actor. Ironically, he could be competing against Downey -- 2008's big comeback story -- for a performance as an actor who takes his Method a little too seriously in ""Tropic Thunder."" Though comedies haven't received much nomination recognition, comedic performers have received some recognition, including ""Blazing Saddles' "" Madeline Kahn, ""Heaven Can Wait's"" Dyan Cannon and ""A Fish Called Wanda's"" Kevin Kline, which can't hurt Downey. There's also his personal story, says O'Neil: After drug abuse nearly killed his career, he starred in ""Thunder"" and ""Iron Man,"" two of 2008's biggest hits. ""He's a hopeful spin on the Ledger story,"" O'Neil says. Martin believes Ledger is a lock. ""I wouldn't be surprised if he wins [outright],"" he says. But ""Dark Knight""? Hollywood will have to get past its disdain for ""comic-book movies."" Which, O'Neil says, it should. ""This isn't just a superhero movie,"" says O'Neil. ""It's come to the rescue of Hollywood during a dark time.""","""The Dark Knight"" was year's top box office film, also critically praised .
Oscar nominations tend to go to ""prestige"" works .
One observer believes ""Knight's"" prospects for best picture nod are ""excellent""

"Editor's note: This is the first story in an ongoing series of reports CNN is doing about economic survival in this time of financial crisis. Sean, Brooke and Courtney with their parents, Donna and Robert LeBlanc, in a 2008 Christmas photo. (CNN) -- Donna LeBlanc gave her husband, a former restaurant manager, the stark ultimatum: become a pizza delivery man or their family ""wouldn't make it."" The Lafayette, Louisiana, family of six was struggling with $45,000 of mounting medical debt from Donna LeBlanc's unexpected case of pneumonia and tonsillitis a year earlier. The family savings account had dwindled to $100. ""It's embarrassing for my husband to take a job he is overqualified for, and I know he feels ashamed at times,"" says Donna LeBlanc, a 35-year-old mother with four children. ""But this is what we have to do and we're going to make the best out of it."" She watched her husband, Rob LeBlanc, 35, load Domino's pizza boxes into their family car and deliver orders until near dawn for $10 an hour. The family first told their story of falling on hard times on iReport.com. Share your economic survivor story with CNN. Until last summer, Rob LeBlanc had worked as a manager at a truck stop restaurant, making $55,000 a year. He lost that job to the falling economy. Rob LeBlanc says he noticed business at the truck stop getting sluggish a year ago. Then the spike in gas prices last summer exacerbated the restaurant's dire circumstances. Many penny-pinching truck drivers avoided his restaurant altogether, he says. Rob LeBlanc filed for unemployment compensation immediately after he lost his job. More than 4.6 million Americans were collecting unemployment benefits as of early January, according to the Labor Department. In Lafayette, a quiet city of about 114,000 tucked away in southern Louisiana, many of the jobs center around servicing the oil and gas industry, but Rob LeBlanc was unwilling to work offshore and away from his family. When he applied for other jobs, he was told he was either under-qualified or had too much experience. After several weeks of searching, he took the only job he could get -- a Domino's pizza delivery man, a job that would cover the family's expenses. ""I had to swallow my pride and take whatever I could get,"" Rob LeBlanc says. ""I kept telling myself one of these days something better will come along."" He spent nearly five months delivering pizzas at Domino's. He admits he fell into depression during that time. But the family received good news Friday, when a private security company hired Rob LeBlanc to be a security officer. He says the company offers many opportunities to move up to a managerial position. ""My first thought was to tell my wife right away,"" he says. ""I could hear the relief in her voice."" Taking a job as a pizza man wasn't the only sacrifice he's made for his family -- he's also selling his beloved 2003 Kawasaki motorcycle. Donna LeBlanc earns a few hundred dollars a week exterminating mosquitoes for a bug control company. Before her husband lost his job, she had talked of going back to school to pursue a biology degree at Louisiana State University. The LeBlanc family lives lean in their five-bedroom, three-bathroom house with its $440 a month mortgage. The couple is teaching their children about budgeting and bargaining while relying on coupons and sales. They no longer eat out and no longer have cable TV. For entertainment, they attend free movies at a church. Donna LeBlanc takes pride that they have no credit card debt. Their children Brooke, 9, Christopher, 14, and Courtney, 13, no longer receive allowances. Soon after her father's job loss, Courtney started cleaning houses and baby-sitting and earned enough money to buy a dress for her first school dance -- off the clearance rack. The LeBlancs' oldest child, Sean, 16, who attends high school, still hasn't found a job. He says the competition has gotten stiff, with many older workers in the area out of jobs. ""I'm trying,"" said Sean, who has been looking for a job since October. ""There are just no openings."" The LeBlancs have found some unexpected happiness. Donna LeBlanc says her husband now spends more time at home. Not being able to leave the house for entertainment has brought the children closer together over books, games and conversation. ""This experience has given us time to reconnect with each other,"" Donna LeBlanc says. ""And it's taught us to just keep trying and believe that things will get better.""","Rob LeBlanc lost his $55,000 manager job because of the troubled economy .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- A bomb inside a van exploded in northeastern Madrid Monday, after a warning call by the Basque separatist group ETA. The blast caused damage but there were no immediate reports of injury. Policemen inspect the area after a van loaded with a bomb exploded in northeast Madrid. The Red Cross received a call at 7:37 a.m. (1:37 a.m. ET), in the name of ETA, warning of the bomb. The Red Cross immediately contacted police, who cordoned off the area, a Red Cross spokeswoman told CNN. The blast occurred shortly after 9 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) outside the building of a construction company, CNN partner network CNN+ reported. The company, Ferrovial Agroman, is involved in building a high-speed train line in the Basque region, which ETA opposes. The attack came just hours after Spain's Supreme Court declined to allow two new leftist Basque parties to compete in the March 1 Basque regional elections in northern Spain. Authorities allege the new parties are simply new names for other leftist Basque parties already outlawed for their links to ETA. ""What ETA did this morning ratifies the Supreme Court decision last night,"" Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told reporters, at the scene of the explosion. At least 30 vehicles parked in the street were damaged, as well as the construction company offices, the Spanish police said in a statement. The bomb, it added, was placed in a van stolen last night in the Madrid area. Exactly four years ago, on Feb. 9, 2005, ETA placed a bomb in the same Madrid neighborhood that was hit on Monday. That attack caused dozens of injuries, and damaged a different glass-façade office building. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence. It is listed as a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States.","Bomb inside van explodes in northeastern Madrid after ETA warning .

"CNN -- Years ago, a frustrated boy with a violent temper attacked his own mother with a hammer (his older brother restrained him). He stabbed a schoolmate over a dispute about which radio station to listen to; the knife blade luckily hit a belt buckle. Carson wants to continue educational efforts and find ways to reform the health care system when he retires. That brash teen today is a world-renowned neurosurgeon and the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Children's Center. Dr. Benjamin S. Carson made medical history in 1987 by performing the first successful surgery that separated twins conjoined at the back of the head. He also became known for his expertise in pediatric brain tumors and methods of controlling seizures. In 2008, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, this country's highest civilian honor. Having come up from the streets of Detroit, Michigan, to receiving an award at the White House, Carson, 56, works to spread his gospel of education and hard work to motivate others. He and his wife, Candy, started a scholarship foundation to help children with strong academics and humanitarian qualities to pay for college. ""I have at least 100,000 letters from kids and adults from around the world ... telling me how it changed their lives,"" Carson said. Their tales of transformations and redemption inspire him to keep talking about educational empowerment and overcoming adversity, he said. An obstacle is a hurdle, and ""you jump over it,"" Carson said.  ""Every time you see a hurdle, you jump over it, and it strengthens you for the next one. And if that's the case, you lead a victorious life, because whatever comes before you, you know you're going to get around it."" Carson was raised in Detroit, majored in psychology at Yale University and attended medical school at the University of Michigan, where he studied neurosurgery. Carson's life has been told through plays, books and movies, including a TNT made-for-TV movie called ""Gifted Hands,"" which airs Saturday. (TNT is part of Turner Broadcasting, which also owns CNN.) The biopic stars Academy Award winner Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carson. ""I think he's an angel, a gift from God,""  Gooding said. ""He has touched a lot of people's lives."" Carson holds more than 50 honorary doctorates and hundreds of other awards. He's fortunate, he acknowledges, but this doctor does not believe in luck. ""I always say you make your own luck by being prepared,"" he said. His mom pushed him hard. Sonya Carson ""would not accept the victim mentality. She wouldn't let us accept the victim mentality. No excuses. She didn't make excuses, and she didn't accept excuses,"" Carson said. She turned off the TV, sent Carson and his brother to the library and made them write weekly book reports. Meanwhile, she worked several jobs to support her two sons. She is now 80 and lives with Carson in Baltimore, Maryland. When Carson was young, he was influenced by stories about Booker T. Washington, a former slave who taught himself to read and later advised presidents, and the biblical character Joseph, who persevered though his brothers sold him into slavery. ""Those kinds of stories had an impact on me and helped me to believe it's not where you started, it's where you end that counts. And you have a whole lot to do with that,"" he said. ""Everybody has problems. They just come in different forms. If that problem for you becomes a containing fence, then you become a victim. Once you think you're a victim, you are one, and you're not going anywhere."" In the same way, Carson's biography has resonated with people like 22-year-old Douglas Nivens II of Baltimore, Maryland. Nivens' mother was killed when he was 4 years old, and his father was imprisoned for her murder. His aunt raised him, and he endured relentless teasing for his interest in academics while attending public schools in Baltimore City. During middle school, Nivens picked up Carson's autobiography, ""Gifted Hands,"" and immediately identified with it. ""It was a relief to see someone grew up in the city and didn't have a luxurious life but overcame it all,"" he said. ""I love stories about underdogs, those who overcome adversity and do something."" When he was in middle school, Nivens won two $1,000 scholarships from the Carson Scholars Fund, which helps children with strong academics pay for college. ""When it came to times of doubt during high school, when I talked to my adviser, they would say, 'You got this award. Not everyone gets it. You're not dumb. You have the tools to be successful in life,' "" Nivens said. ""That's what really helped me in terms of self-esteem and management in high school."" He graduated with honors from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in May. ""I probably should not be where I am,"" said Nivens, a budget analyst for the U.S. Social Security Administration. ""I went to Baltimore public schools. My father's in jail; my mother is dead. Statistically, I should not be here. I should be on parole somewhere or even dead. I never looked at it that way. I made it through."" Carson said he's heartened by stories pf people who've been inspired by his biography. ""My message is that the person who has the most to do with what happens to you is you,"" Carson said. ""Not somebody else, and not the environment. If you have a normal brain, you're capable of incredible things.""","Doctor overcame troubled youth to head pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins .

"(CNN) -- Just west of Seville in Spain, a sea of giant mirrors is reflecting the sun's energy to provide ""concentrated solar power"" (CSP) while illuminating the path to a new wave of green energy projects. Shining beacon: The concentrated solar power plant in Sanlucar, Spain is the first of its kind. The 624 carefully positioned mirrors reflect the sun's heat towards a 50 meter-tall central tower where it is concentrated and used to boil water into steam. The superheated steam is then used to turn a turbine that can produce up to 11 megawatts of electricity -- enough power for 6,000 homes -- according Solucar, the Spanish company that has built the power plant. While traditional solar panels, photovoltaic cells, convert the sun's power directly into electricity, CSP focuses power from a wide area and uses the vast heat generated to make electricity in a similar way to that produced from coal or oil. The Spanish tower, known as PS10, is the first phase of an ambitious development. By 2013 it is hoped that additional towers will create a ""solar farm"" with an output of 300 megawatts, which would be enough power for 180,000 homes, or equivalent to the entire population of nearby Seville. This $1.5 billion project is the largest commercial CSP station in the world -- so far. But many believe the technology will soon take off in areas of continuous hot sun and clear skies, offering a cheaper and more efficient alternative to photovoltaic cells, and bringing jobs and money to arid, often depressed areas. CSP also produces no greenhouses gasses and the only pollution is visual. The European Union has invested over $31 million in CSP research over the last ten years. At least 50 CSP projects have been given permission to begin construction across Spain. By 2015 the country may be producing two gigawatts of electricity from CSP, and employing thousands in the industry. One of the strengths of CSP is that it allows the construction of power stations on a scale that can match many fossil fuel based plants, and for an investment far less than that required to install the equivalent wattage of photovoltaic cells. There is also the possibility that production can keep going around the clock -- even when the sun has gone down. Solucar is currently testing technology at a plant near Granada that will pump 50 percent of the electricity generated in the day into the Spanish national grid, and use the other 50 percent to melt salt, which will then act as a kind of battery, storing the sun's power. When dusk falls, the heat stored in the molten salt can be used to generate power through the night. ""These technologies excite me,"" says Dr Jeff Hardy, Network Manager at the UK Energy Research Council. ""One of the real advantages is that you can get a decent sized power plant. ""The main challenge with the technology is working with extreme heat, but then a lot of the back-end is very similar to a traditional fossil-fuel generation; you are after all just dealing with water heated to make steam and drive a turbine."" Concentrating on promoting CSP worldwide . As America looks to increase the contribution of renewables to its overall energy mix -- a key part of the Obama plan before the recession turbocharged Government funding for such ""green"" infrastructure projects -- the potential of CSP technology is obvious. The Spanish company responsible for the Sanlucar la Mayor plant has seen the potential and created Solucar Power, Inc., a subsidiary aiming to develop the market in the USA. There is already a huge Solar Energy Generating Systems' CSP station in the Mojave Desert, California; Spanish firm Acciona has built a plant near Las Vegas. Many more are surely on their way. One bold projection estimates that a single plant 100 miles by 100 miles located in the American South West could generate enough electricity for the whole country. It would obviously be a huge undertaking -- politically, financially and scientifically -- but it's not hard to imagine such a scheme finding a home in the nation's vast, empty quarter. Other equally arid areas may also find themselves transformed, and CSP may be able to offer valuable foreign earnings for drought-stricken Africa -- while giving Europe the green energy it needs. According to Dr Hardy the technology has a ready application, given the right political, environmental and economic context. ""Concentrated Solar Power is proven to do well in countries like Spain with a favorable government policies and the right climate,"" he says. ""I can certainly see the potential for extended networks linking together, and the idea of a North African grid linking renewable resources is a real possibility."" Providing power, jobs and money . The Sahara, the world's largest desert, is fringed by some of the poorest countries in the world and the harsh environment has always been seen as a problem, with it's vast, waterless interior regularly reaching temperatures of over 45 degrees Celsius. But with large-scale CSP projects, suddenly all that empty space, with its year-round clear skies and hot sun, has a value that could transform local economies. It could potentially turn Africa into a net exporter of energy to power-hungry Europe, and perhaps even do for countries in North Africa what oil did for Saudi Arabia. The sums are dizzying. Estimates vary, but one projection from the German Aerospace Agency puts the amount of solar energy stored in just one per cent of the Sahara -- 35,000 square miles, or a piece of land slightly smaller than Portugal -- as having the potential to yield more power than all the world's existing power plants combined. Already Spanish firms are exporting CSP technology to Morocco and Algeria, and a British consortium, the Sahara Forest Project, is testing the technology in the deserts of Oman. Costs and benefits . However, there is a problem: at the moment costs are still very high. But they are falling as plants get bigger, the technology is perfected and economies of scale kick in. Even so, any plans to power Europe from the Sahara would require a vast infrastructure of CSP plants and cables laid across the Mediterranean -- requiring billions upon billions of dollars in investment. Such sums will only be possible through international co-operation on a huge scale. But on a smaller, more local scale a simple change in the way electricity generators are paid has been hugely effective in boosting renewable power. In Spain and other European countries investment has been encouraged by Governments creating what's known as a ""feed in tariff,"" which pays companies a premium for power sold to the national grid generated by renewable means for a fixed period of time. This enables investors to pay back up front costs more quickly. Where they have been introduced they have brought about a huge increase in renewable power: Germany has 200 times as much solar energy as Britain, generates 12 percent of its electricity from renewables, and has created a quarter of a million jobs in the sector. We're a long way from a future where the Sahara becomes the world's largest source of renewable electricity, and the American South West is covered in mirrors lighting and powering cities across the continent. There are many huge issues yet to resolve, but with small steps, we may be moving towards it.","Concentrated solar power projects in Spain leading field in that form of green energy .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Fifteen crew members of a South African Airways flight spent the night in jail after customs officials found marijuana and cocaine worth nearly half a million dollars hidden aboard a long-distance flight to London, British customs officials said Wednesday. South African Airways said it has a zero-tolerance approach towards any criminal activity. The 10 women and five men -- who include three pilots -- were detained on arrival from Johannesburg, South Africa, after customs officials found 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of marijuana and 4 kilograms (8.8 pounds) of cocaine in three pieces of baggage, HM Revenue and Customs said. The drugs are estimated to be worth a total of £310,000 ($428,000), customs officials added. Border agents arrested the crew at London's Heathrow Airport on suspicion of involvement in smuggling prohibited drugs into the United Kingdom, customs spokesman Bob Gaiger said. He said he was not able to disclose what led investigators to believe the suitcases belonged to the crew members.

"(CNN) -- A Seattle man has been charged with insurance fraud for allegedly sinking his own yacht because of ""financial pressure and frustration with the maintenance"" of the vessel, authorities said. The Jubilee sank in Puget Sound Bay last year. On March 22, 2008, Brian Lewis, 50, scuttled the Jubilee in the Puget Sound Bay, then rowed a borrowed dinghy back to shore, according to court documents filed in February by prosecutors in King County, Washington. Later that day, Lewis boarded a flight to take him to his job in Kodiak, Alaska, as a petty officer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, according to court documents. Three days later, Lewis filed an insurance claim with USAA Insurance reporting the Jubilee sank accidentally ""due to unknown causes."" However, due to environmental concerns, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources salvaged the vessel at a cost to the state of $2,866. An inspection found a hole was drilled into the bottom of the Jubilee, and that two main engine sea strainers appeared to have been broken with a hammer. ""The vessel appeared to have been deliberately sunk,"" authorities said in their probable cause affidavit. Confronted by investigators, Lewis admitted he intentionally sank his vessel, saying the financial strain ""caused him extreme anxiety and frustration."" Lewis told investigators ""the engine trouble he experienced caused him to lose his temper. In his rage, he smashed the sea strainers with a hammer and drilled the hole to sink the vessel,"" the affidavit said. ""[He] wanted to clarify that his motive for sinking the vessel was anger and frustration, not greed,"" it added. Prior to its sinking, the Jubilee had been listed for sale with Mahina Yachts for $28,500. Jack Bateman, a broker with Mahina, remembers the Jubilee as a ""beautiful"" 1967 Chris Craft Cavalier. He said the Mahina has only seen this type of case one other time in its 30 years of operation. ""This is a very rare, not common occurrence"" he says. Bateman added that Mahina has yet to see any real distress sales due to the bad economy. The King County Prosecutor's Office has charged Lewis with making a fraudulent insurance claim. Lewis filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2004. Messages left for him were not returned.","Insurance fraud charges were filed against Seattle man accused of scuttling yacht .

"(CNN) -- When Barack Obama is sworn in as the 44th president of the United States, the wish list that has been building abroad may have grown longer than he or anyone else can deliver. The world's newspapers marked Barack Obama's election win. Now, world governments want him to act. There are the apparently eternal conflicts of the Middle East and Kashmir, between India and Pakistan, that have already reared their ugly heads almost as a warning even before Obama took office. Between them, they engulf most of the grievances and violence that shape the Islamic world and its relations with the United States. Intense U.S. involvement will be needed to help resolve both of the conflicts. This will require imagination, creative out-of-the-box diplomacy, and the courage to see it through both from the United States and leaders on the ground. Going back even to the status-quo ante will no longer be sufficient. The 30-year-old rupture in relations between the United States and Iran is also expected to be addressed as a key priority by the new administration. Both the president-elect and his secretary of state-designate have said they want to abandon the silent treatment and isolation of previous administrations and try engaging Iran, as a way of resolving difficult issues such as its nuclear program and its influence in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Watch Amanpour talk about world views of Obama » . The United States remains bogged down in hot wars in both of those countries. While the Obama administration plans to increase troops and nation-building in Afghanistan, it is also signaling it will not give President Hamid Karzai's government the ""free ride"" he is thought to have received from the Bush administration. Karzai will be expected to root out corruption and better address the needs of the Afghan people. The new administration will also try to revive nuclear arms agreements that have been abandoned over the last eight years and try to forge a more constructive relationship with Russia, while persuading that country to meet its international obligations too. While many allies -- and adversaries -- welcome the new U.S. administration's declaration to use diplomacy and soft power, the question remains: Will Washington's allies also pull their weight in helping set their common agenda? Many nations and governments say they welcome America's vital global leadership, and the question at the start of the Obama administration is: Will they rise robustly to the occasion, and not just carp from the sidelines? While much is expected from Obama, much, too, will be expected from his allies.","World has long wish list for Barack Obama when he becomes president .

"(CNN) -- Passengers on the US Airways flight that crash-landed into the Hudson River Thursday afternoon praised the actions and courage of the pilot, a safety consultant with 40 years of experience in the aviation industry. Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger, a former Air Force fighter pilot, has been with US Airways since 1980. Sources tell CNN that Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger was piloting US Airways flight 1549 from New York's LaGuardia airport to Charlotte, North Carolina, when at least one of the plane's engines failed. Passenger Jeff Kolodjay offered ""kudos"" to Sullenberger for a landing that minimized damage to the aircraft and its 155 passengers and crew. ""All of a sudden the captain came on and he told us to brace ourselves and probably brace ourselves pretty hard. But he did an amazing job -- kudos to him on that landing,"" said Kolodjay, who was sitting in seat 22A. Sullenberger's wife told CNN that she was stunned to hear the news from her husband after it was all over. ""I hadn't been watching the news. I've heard Sully say to people, 'It's rare for an airline pilot to have an incident in their career,' "" said Lori Sullenberger of Danville, California. ""When he called me he said, 'There's been an accident.' At first I thought it was something minor, but then he told me the circumstances and my body started shaking and I rushed to get our daughters out of school."" US Airways said all 155 passengers and crew are alive and safely off the plane. The crash-landing has also earned the former fighter pilot and private safety consultant accolades from state and government officials. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg commended the pilot for not leaving the plane without checking to make sure every passenger had been evacuated. ""It would appear that the pilot did a masterful job of landing the plane in the river and then making sure that everybody got out,"" Bloomberg said at a press conference Thursday. ""I had a long conversation with the pilot. He walked the plane twice after everybody else was off and tried to verify that there was nobody else on board -- and assures us there was not."" Sullenberger apparently was forced to make an emergency landing after geese were sucked into one or both of the jet's engines. An eyewitness working on the west side of Manhattan said the belly of the plane touched the water first. An official who heard tape recordings of the radio traffic from Flight 1549 reported the pilot was extraordinarily calm during the event. ""There was no panic, no hysterics,"" the official said. ""It was professional, it was calm, it was methodical. It was everything you hoped it could be."" The pilot and air traffic controller discussed options, including landing at Teterboro airport in New Jersey, the official said. Then there was a ""period of time where there was no communications back, and I'm assuming he was concentrating on more important things."" Sullenberger's background in aviation appeared to have prepared him for such a situation. He has been a pilot with US Airways since 1980, following seven years in the U.S. Air Force. His resume -- posted on the Web site for his safety consulting firm, Safety Reliability Methods, Inc. -- lists piloting procedures, technical safety strategies, emergency management and operations improvement, as areas of industry expertise. He served as an instructor and Air Line Pilots Association safety chairman, accident investigator and national technical committee member, according to a biography on the site. He participated in several USAF and National Transportation Safety Board accident investigations, and worked with NASA scientists on a paper on error and aviation, his site says. For the passengers on flight 1549, Sullenberger's skill and expertise were apparent. iReport.com: Did you see the crash-landing? Send images . ""I've flown in a lot of planes and that was a phenomenal landing,"" said passenger Fred Berretta said. Berretta was sitting in seat 16A right over one of the engines when it failed and the pilot turned the plane to align it with the Hudson River. He described silence in the plane as the passengers waited to hear from the crew. A few moments later, the direction to brace for landing came.

"(CNN) -- A NASA satellite crashed back to Earth about three minutes after launch early Tuesday, officials said. NASA launches a rocket from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base on Tuesday. ""We could not make orbit,"" NASA program manager John Brunschwyler said. ""Initial indications are the vehicle did not have enough [force] to reach orbit and landed just short of Antarctica in the ocean."" ""Certainly for the science community, it's a huge disappointment."" The satellite, which would have monitored greenhouse gases to study how they affect the Earth's climate, was launched on a Taurus XL rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 1:55 a.m. PT (4:55 a.m. ET). But the payload fairing -- a clamshell-shaped structure that allows the satellite to travel through space -- failed to separate from the rocket, NASA officials said.  See video of launch » . The weight of the fairing caused the rocket and the satellite to come crashing down to Earth about three minutes later. A team of investigators will look into what caused the payload fairing to fail to separate. ""We'll get back to flying at a pace that allows us to do so successfully,"" said Chuck Dovale, NASA Launch Director, at a press briefing after the failed launch. The $273 million satellite, called the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, would have collected global measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere to help better forecast changes in carbon-dioxide levels and their effect on the Earth's climate. Carbon dioxide is considered a greenhouse gas because it traps heat, which scientists believe contributes to the warming of the planet. Carbon dioxide also absorbs wavelengths of light, and the NASA observatory would have measured levels of the gas partly by using instruments to analyze light reflected off the Earth. The OCO also would have provided information about CO2 ""sinks"" -- areas, like oceans or landfills, that absorb and store carbon dioxide. NASA officials said all measurements would be combined with the findings of ground observation stations, providing a more complete account of the human and natural sources of CO2. The OCO project took eight years to develop, said Michael Frelich, director of the NASA Earth Science Division. Its failure is a great loss for the science community, he said.","NEW: Satellite crashed into ocean near Antarctica minutes after launch, NASA says .

"Editor's note: A nationally syndicated columnist, Roland S. Martin is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says Sasha Obama is from a generation raised in a diverse world and open to possibility. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There are so many things that we could take away and remember forever regarding the inauguration of the first African-American president in the history of the United States, but I'll always remember the laughter of a little girl. Shortly after President-elect Barack Obama finished the oath and became President Barack Obama, he joined hands with his family and waved to the cheering voices of 1.8 million people packed from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial. People cried, others hugged, celebrities and everyday folks snapped photos to capture the moment. There really was an amazing energy that permeated the crowd as we all witnessed a barrier come tumbling down before our eyes. But what stood out for me was a moment when President Obama looked down at his 7-year-old daughter, Sasha, and she said something to him, and then let out this huge laugh. I don't know whether it was her statement or his response, but the bubbly child was having the time of her life. The sheer joy that was on her face as she grinned from ear to ear caused me to just start laughing as I watched her reaction. I was shooting photos from the CNN platform just across from where he spoke, and one of the many images was of a beaming Sasha alongside her mom and 10-year-old sister, Malia. Can you imagine what was going through this young girl's mind, to see her father stand there and take the oath of office? As I saw her that day, and later bouncing along a sidewalk as she walked with her father, my niece Anastacia came to mind. Their smiles and bouncy walk are so much alike, and both are the same age. These young girls, and countless other black children, among others, will grow up in an America where what they can imagine is backed up by what they see. Despite the reality that racism hasn't left us, these children have the advantage of not being burdened with being separated by race. So much has been written about today's generation living in a world where hip-hop music brought them all together in one room, coupled with the diverse images on television and movies. Their reality is not the reality of their parents, and we will see that play out a lot in the future. What also is most compelling about this age of Obama is how he has been received thus far internationally. Many political experts are simply stunned that a man who has only been on the national stage for five years would have so much good will across the pond. Of course, a lot of that has to do with the fact that President George W. Bush and his team were seen as running roughshod over their international partners, praising them when they needed something, and savaging them when they disagreed with the U.S. position. Yet what we also can't ignore is that Obama's skin tone also plays a central role. Americans may be shocked to find out that people of color make up two-thirds of the world population. They know all too well about America's pathetic and violent history of enslaving and later oppressing African-Americans, and it was always seen as ridiculous for U.S. officials to condemn human rights abuses abroad while racial and other forms of discrimination existed in their own backyard. Obama's election sends a powerful signal to the world that Americans are backing up their rhetoric and ideals with action, and Obama serves as that powerful symbol. Barack Hussein Obama now has the opportunity to show those who voted for him -- and those who didn't -- that the change he often spoke about can come to pass. If he is able to fulfill many of the promises he made during the campaign, he will go down as one of America's most successful presidents, looked at fondly by the American people. And if he does, maybe we'll end up having the same smile he received courtesy of Sasha. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: Sasha Obama laughed joyously after her father took the oath .

"(CNN) -- An Ohio man who was suspended as the drum major of a band for giving President Obama a nod during last week's inaugural parade is calling it quits. John Coleman quit his band after it suspended him for nodding to President Obama last week. John Coleman resigned from the Cleveland Firefighters Memorial Pipes & Drums a week after the parade in Washington. Publicity about his suspension had gotten to be too much, he told CNN affiliate WEWS. ""It's come to a point where I don't want embarrassment anymore between the pipe band and myself,"" Coleman, who is a firefighter, told WEWS on Tuesday. Coleman was seen during the nationally televised January 20 parade nodding toward the new president while marching with the band. A few steps later, he appeared to wave briefly. He told WEWS that as the band was marching past the grandstand where Obama was sitting, he made eye contact with the president. ""Contact was made with our eyes both together and he smiled and waved at the band,"" he told the station. ""And just as a gesture, I nodded my head. I gave him a slight wave and went on.""  Watch parade and explanation » . Representatives from the group did not return calls from CNN. But bandleader Mike Engle told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that Coleman was suspended because he ignored military protocol. ""We had gone over and over time and again with everyone in the band that this was a military parade,"" Engle told the newspaper. ""Protocol and proper decorum had to be followed at all times. Unfortunately, John chose to ignore that."" Coleman had been suspended from the band for six months. In a written statement, band manager Ken Rybka said Coleman's resignation from the group ""comes as a shock and surprise."" The band has been inundated with phone calls, e-mails and messages on its Internet pages -- almost all of them critical -- since the story first broke on Monday, Rybka said. iReport.com: 'Pretty cool thing that he acknowledged the president' ""It is unfortunate that an internal band issue has raised so much discussion and ire from the general public,"" Rybka said in the statement. ""It has disheartened me more than you can imagine."" Rybka said that he will be taking a leave of absence from the band because of the furor.

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Friday expressing its intent to, eventually, send U.N. peacekeeping forces back to the fractured, unstable nation of Somalia. Islamist insurgents display their weaponry Friday in Mogadishu during a parade. The resolution was sponsored by the U.S., in one of the final Bush Administration initiatives at the United Nations. The passage of the resolution follows the exit of a U.N.-backed, Ethiopian peacekeeping force that completed a two-year deployment in Somalia Thursday. There is wide-spread concern among diplomats and regional leaders in the Horn of Africa that, with the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces, a power vacuum will be filled in Somalia by regional Islamic extremist groups, some with links to al-Qaeda. The U.N. resolution sets forth a process that aims to bring stability and sovereignty to Somalia, which has been racked by violence and lawlessness since the government was overthrown in 1991. First, the resolution expresses renewed support that an African Union force currently deployed in Somalia -- known as AMISOM -- remains on the ground. The A.U. contingent is currently comprised of 2,600 troops. The U.N. resolution calls on the African Union to strengthen those levels to 8,000. The resolution then requests that U.N. Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, submit a report by April 15, 2009 updating the situation in Somalia, and it asks that he develop the mandate for a U.N. peacekeeping force. Finally, a decision on U.N. peacekeeping is requested by June 1, 2009. However, the process is off to a rocky start. Last month, Ban said that requests to U.N. member nations for peacekeeping forces for Somalia were received negatively. Also, throughout, one of the key players in the Somalia decisions will likely be Susan Rice, President-Elect Obama's nominee for new U.S.- U.N. Ambassador, and a specialist on African issues. At her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Washington on Thursday, Rice told senators that she is ""skeptical about the wisdom of a United Nations peacekeeping force in Somalia at this time.""","Resolution expresses intent to send U.N. peacekeeping forces to Somalia .

"(CNN) -- Forests in the Pacific Northwest are dying twice as fast as they were 17 years ago, and scientists blame warming temperatures for the trend, according to a new study. This photo of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado shows dying pines and firs among healthy trees. The study, to be released Friday in the journal Science, is the first large-scale analysis of environmental changes as contributing factors in the mortality of coniferous forests. The data for this research was gathered by generations of scientists over a 50-year period at multiple sites in Oregon, Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and southwestern British Columbia. Seventy-six forest plots, all more than 200 years old, were monitored by scientists doing some of the most rudimentary research -- counting trees. ""It's not a happy story, but, an important one,"" said Phillip van Mantgem, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and the lead author of the study. ""These are beautiful places. They do change and respond to their environment, sometimes quickly."" ""If in your hometown where you live, the death rates of your friends and neighbors doubled and there are no compensating birth rates, wouldn't you want to figure out what's going on?"" said Nathan Stephenson, research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and one of the authors of the report. The study primarily focused on three types of coniferous trees: pines, firs and hemlocks. Older-growth forests -- some up to 500 years old -- have trees of all ages, and researchers found that mortality rates have increased for all age groups. Since mortality rates went up across the board, scientists ruled out a number of other possible causes, including ozone-related air pollution, long-term effects of fire suppression and normal forest dynamics. In the end, California had the highest tree death rate. Of the three types of coniferous trees studied, pines were found to be dying at the fastest rate. Ultimately, higher tree mortality may lead to significant shifts in forest structure and function, the report states. ""Much of the world's population in North America, Europe, most of China and large portions of Russia live near temperate forests, so what happens in these forests has global importance,"" said Jerry Franklin, a professor of forest resources at the University of Washington whose work was instrumental in maintaining the research plots. ""My guess is that forest loss has the potential to greatly exceed forest establishment,"" he added. The new findings concern scientists who see the study as further confirmation of the harmful effects of climate change on ecosystems. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scientific intergovernmental body, concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are now at their highest levels for at least 650,000 years. Scientists on the panel say the increase began with the birth of the Industrial Revolution 250 years ago. The new research also suggests that as trees die, they actually emit more carbon than they absorb. Trees are key players in regulating climate because they convert carbon dioxide, which they store in their trunks and roots, to oxygen. Changes in climatic conditions or various diseases can cause the gradual dying of plant shoots. ""The concern here is that these might be early warning signs of dieback,"" said Stephenson. Some scientists say that tree species unable to tolerate warmer conditions might just re-establish themselves in cooler areas. Given the speed at which warming appears to be occurring, it's not clear whether tree species will be able to migrate fast enough to survive, said van Mantgem of the U.S. Geological Survey. ""Warmer temperatures cause earlier summer droughts, less snow pack, and cause ideal breeding grounds for invasive species and pathogens,"" he added. ""One hypothesis is that warmer climates can make it easier for invasive species to reproduce and grow in these temperate forests. If the trees are already under a lot of environmental stress, they are more prone to serious insect attack,"" he said. Scientists say forests in the Western U.S. have been increasingly damaged in recent years by invasive insect species such as the bark beetle -- a sign that rising temperatures are having an adverse effect. Bark beetles are known to attack trees already weakened by other environmental factors. ""Many of these beetles cannot survive in cold temperatures, and it's getting warmer,"" said Tim Barnett, a ­research marine physicist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. Barnett authored a research paper linking drought conditions in the American West to increased human activity. ""It is perfectly reasonable to assume that this problem is going to get worse, not better,"" he said.","Forests in the Pacific Northwest are dying twice as fast as they were 17 years ago .
