"(CNN) -- A former hospital worker systematically shot and killed four people in upstate New York on Saturday, authorities in two counties said. Former hospital worker Frank Garcia, 34, has been accused in the shooting rampage. Frank Garcia, 34, was arrested Saturday afternoon. Garcia knew all four victims, police said, but they didn't reveal details about the relationships. ""The individuals who were shot were known to the suspect. It was not necessarily a random act,"" Monroe County Sheriff Patrick O'Flynn said. The first two victims -- Mary Sillman, 23, and Randall Norman, 41 -- were fatally shot before 5 a.m. at Lakeside Memorial Hospital in Brockport, where Garcia was once employed, O'Flynn said. Another woman was wounded and is undergoing treatment at a nearby hospital, he said. The second shooting happened at a house in nearby Ontario County on Saturday afternoon. Christopher Glatz, 45, and his wife, Kim, 38, were killed ""execution-style"" while their two teenagers were in the suburban Rochester home, Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero said. The teens were not wounded, but it is unclear whether they witnessed the event. Povero said neighbors reported Garcia went door-to-door looking for the Glatzes' home. ""He was in fact looking for the residence,"" Povero said. ""He was saying different things to different people, but he was clearly looking for that home."" Ballistic evidence has connected the two crime scenes, Povero said. Investigators found the matching brass cartridges from a pistol found on Garcia when he was arrested, he said. Garcia was arrested at a restaurant Saturday afternoon, CNN affiliate R-News in Rochester reported. Garcia was to be arraigned Saturday night in Monroe County, where the first shootings occurred, on two counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder in the second degree, O'Flynn said. Sillman was a certified nursing assistant at Lakeside's long-term care center, hospital officials said. ""During Mary's brief time within the system, those who worked closest with Mary described her as warm, kind and compassionate toward the residents of Lakeside Beikirch Care Center,"" Lakeside interim CEO Michael Stapleton said in a statement. Garcia likely will face similar charges in Ontario County, Povero said. ""This certainly speaks to a tragedy that is enormous, not only the taking of the lives that were taken, but the people that were left behind, the person in Brockport and the two teenage children who were present when their mother was systematically murdered,"" Povero said.","Suspect went door-to-door in search of victims' residence, authorities say .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- One of the main stumbling blocks to talk with Iran has been the condition that Iran suspends its uranium enrichment. Now, the Obama administration may take that option off the table, at least for now. This is from an Iranian nuclear plant in the central province of Isfahan on April 9. The United States and its European allies, which have just invited Iran to a fresh round of nuclear talks, are coming to the realization that if Iran's nuclear program isn't quite at the point of no return, it will be soon. With 5,500 centrifuges, roughly enough for about two weapons worth of uranium a year, Iran isn't going to just shut down its enrichment facility as a goodwill gesture. For years, Iran has been willing to endure sanctions and economic isolation. What it hasn't been willing to do is suspend enrichment. Iran maintains enriching uranium for nuclear energy is its right. Now the West seems to have come around to Iran's way of thinking. Last week during a speech on proliferation in Prague, Czech Republic, President Obama admitted as much when he said, ""We will support Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy with rigorous inspections."" The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, has long argued to allow Iran to maintain a small face-saving nuclear enrichment program under the guise of ""research and development."" Allowing such a program under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, at least while negotiations continue, would involve strict IAEA inspections -- something which may give the international community the kind of insight into Iran's nuclear program which it has long sought. It would also give Iran the cover to come back to the table without claiming it never gave in to the West. Rather, Tehran can boast the international community came around to its point of view. Preventing Iranian enrichment may be an ultimate pipe dream, but officials hope the right package of incentives, coupled with the threat of tougher sanctions, which could cripple its stumbling economy, could deter Tehran from developing a nuclear bomb. If adopted, the new strategy will undoubtedly be condemned by Israel, which has warned the U.S. that it has until the end of the year to put an end to Iran's uranium production before it takes matters into its own hands. However, moving beyond the issue of enrichment helps Obama inch closer toward engagement with Iran, something he promised during the campaign and has begun to undertake with small, albeit significant, steps, most noticeably his New Year's message to the Iranian people. Those who watch Iran closely say Obama's outreach is being warmly received in the region. While the response from spiritual leader Ayatollah Khamanei and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad seems vague at first glance, experts argue the regime is being quite conciliatory, even flirting with the U.S. overtures and opening the door for talks. Now the administration is taking another leap, inviting Iran to several meetings on Afghanistan as a way to engage on issues of mutual interest. The U.S. is also seriously considering allowing U.S. diplomats around the world to interact with their Iranian counterparts and setting up a U.S. interests section in Iran. Officials say not to expect any dramatic breakthroughs before the Iranians head to the polls to elect a new president in June. But Obama's conservative critics, including several Republican lawmakers, worry Obama is making it too easy for Iran to come back to the table and is giving credibility to Iran's defiant Ahmadinejad in his bid for re-election. The goal of stopping Iran from building a nuclear weapon remains, but the tactics are shifting and the rules of the game have changed. Obama and his advisers are betting that by finally giving Iran what it thinks it wants, the U.S. and its allies will get what they need -- a way to bring Iran to the table and start meaningful negotiations, which have eluded them for the past four years.","White House may drop key condition that Iran suspend its nuclear program .

"MORRISTOWN, New Jersey (CNN) -- Since the beginning of the year the family clinic at the Children's Hospital of New Jersey has seen an influx of young children coming in for flu shots. New Jersey requires children from 6 months to 5 years old to get the flu vaccine to attend daycare or pre-school. The rush for vaccinations is prompted by a new law that makes New Jersey the only state requiring children between 6 months and 5 years old to get the flu vaccine to attend a licensed daycare or pre-school. The deadline for the flu shot requirement was December 31. Some parents are upset about the requirement. John General and Alnisa Bernabela brought their 4-year-old twins Jahmein and Jameir to the clinic last week for the flu shots. ""I'm really not okay with it because I think it should have been my choice,"" said Bernabela. ""By them forcing this, I feel like our rights have been violated,"" said General, holding his crying son Jameir being vaccinated. Last fall, hundreds of parents with the New Jersey Coalition for Vaccination Choice challenged the flu shot requirement at a rally in Trenton, New Jersey. The NJCVC and parents interviewed by CNN, expressed concern about the safety of influenza vaccines and possible long-term effects on young children. But the New Jersey Department of Health says the new law is for the public good citing Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention numbers showing an average of 20,000 children under age 5 are hospitalized nationwide each year because of influenza complications. ""Parents are certainly concerned about the health and safety of their children,"" says Dr. Christina Tan, state epidemiologist for the New Jersey Department of Health. ""But it's equally important to understand that the flu vaccine is safe and effective in preventing illness, not only in children, but also among the community as a whole."" Many doctors support the decision, saying it helps protect a higher risk population.  Some parents object to mandatory vaccines » . ""Kids under the age of 5 are targeted by this recommendation because when they get the disease they get sicker than adults do. They also are the ones who are more likely to transmit the flu because they are in closed quarters,"" said Dr. Nwando Anyaoku, who heads the clinic at the Children's Hospital of New Jersey. She says influenza tends to peak in New Jersey towards the end of January through early February. Jennifer Frank says she's committed to the public health goal but not on the state's schedule. Her 2-year-old son Caleb was hospitalized twice for extreme eczema as an infant. At one point, he was on a feeding tube, and she says he couldn't get vaccinated. ""There was literally no clear space to put a needle,"" says Jennifer Frank. Caleb's doctors were stumped and couldn't make a diagnosis for his condition. Since then, the Franks with their pediatrician's approval, have Caleb on a delayed vaccination schedule. As a result, they didn't meet the state's December 31 flu shot deadline and now their local board of health has banned Caleb from pre-school. ""When he gets his shots, that same rash flares up,"" says Joshua Frank, the father of Caleb. ""You know, it's frightening. It's very real. And for them to say, 'Well, we don't care, even though your doctors agree with you,' is outrageous."" The Franks have appealed the local board of health's decision all the way to the state level, but officials have not wavered. While New Jersey does offer medical exemptions for some children, the rules are specific, and eczema is not considered a valid medical reason for delaying the flu vaccine. ""By allowing broader exemptions this could potentially erode the very core of protection,"" says Tan. But the Franks believe the new law should include an appeal procedure, especially for families like theirs that are willing to vaccinate their children. New Jersey Republican Assemblywoman Charlotte Vandervalk has been working on legislation to allow parents to decide which vaccines they want their child to receive. ""The bill gives conscientious objection so that people can opt out of certain vaccines. Maybe they want some vaccines and not others and this would give them the right to do that,"" said Vandervalk. For now, though, Caleb must remain out of school. He's confused as to why he can't return. ""He doesn't understand what's going on,"" says Jennifer Frank. ""It's been hard to explain it to him."" The New Jersey Department of Health says it won't immediately know what kind of effect the new flu shot requirement will have on the state's population. ""As far as trying to identify whether there's actually a drop in disease incidence in the community, that's going to be a longer term type of evaluation that we're starting to look at,"" says Tan.

"SAMSON, Alabama (CNN)  -- ""Get home now."" Sheriff's Deputy Josh Myers' wife and toddler daughter were killed; his son and baby daughter survived. Geneva County Sheriff's Deputy Josh Myers quickly hung up the phone after he got his friend's message on Tuesday and started for the town of Samson, having no idea what had happened to his wife or his three children. Then, another urgent message: . ""We got notified on the radio that a trooper was chasing a suspect that had fired shots,"" Myers told reporters on Wednesday. Instead of heading home, the deputy drove to Reliable Metal Products plant in the nearby town of Geneva, where he engaged in a shoot-out with the suspect, who then entered the building and shot and killed himself. Myers had no idea that 30 minutes earlier, the suspect had shot and killed his wife and 1½-year-old daughter, Corinne Gracy, and shot and wounded his 3-month-old baby girl, Ella Kay. They were victims of the bloodiest rampage in Alabama's history, carried out by Michael McLendon, who killed 10 people before turning one of his guns on himself. A family friend found the couple's 4-year-old son hiding in the Myers' home after the shooting. Watch Josh Myers tell his story: ""I need help"" » . ""He was present when it happened,"" Myers said. ""He knows something's wrong. He asked where mama was, and I had to tell him she was with Jesus. This is going to take a long time to work through it."" Andrea Myers, 31, was holding Ella Kay and talking with her neighbors on their porch across the street when the gunman -- identified by police as Michael McLendon -- opened fire. The neighbors turned out to be McLendon's relatives, although it was unclear why he targeted them. He said his neighbor Alina Knowles saved his wounded daughter's life. iReport.com: Officials investigate . ""She ran up on the porch and got my baby girl and took her to safety,"" Myers said. Knowles said she scooped up Myers' crying 3-month-old daughter and ducked behind a minivan as McLendon cruised down an adjacent street, still firing at people. Read Knowles' full account . The 10 people McLendon killed before he shot himself to death included his mother, grandmother, other relatives and strangers. Ella Kay, who was shot in the leg, will have surgery on Wednesday at a hospital in Pensacola, Florida, to remove the bullet or shrapnel that is near her femoral artery, Myers said. A day after Tuesday's shootings, Myers stood in front of his home, across the street from the house where his family was killed, and spoke to reporters.   Watch report on Alabama rampage » . ""It's supposed to be me out here getting shot, not my family,"" Myers said, speaking barely above a whisper. ""I'd step out on the street any day and take a bullet for anybody in this community.

"(CNN) -- For years after his NFL career ended, Ted Johnson could barely muster the energy to leave his house. In healthy brain tissue, virtually no protein tangles, which show up as brown spots, are visible. ""I'd [leave to] go see my kids for maybe 15 minutes,"" said Johnson. ""Then I would go back home and close the curtains, turn the lights off and I'd stay in bed. That was my routine for two years. ""Those were bad days."" These days, the former linebacker is less likely to recount the hundreds of tackles, scores of quarterback sacks or the three Super Bowl rings he earned as a linebacker for the New England Patriots. He is more likely to talk about suffering more than 100 concussions. ""I can definitely point to 2002 when I got back-to-back concussions. That's where the problems started,"" said Johnson, who retired after those two concussions. ""The depression, the sleep disorders and the mental fatigue."" Until recently, the best medical definition for concussion was a jarring blow to the head that temporarily stunned the senses, occasionally leading to unconsciousness. It has been considered an invisible injury, impossible to test -- no MRI, no CT scan can detect it.  Watch more on what goes on in athlete's brains » . But today, using tissue from retired NFL athletes culled posthumously, the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (CSTE), at the Boston University School of Medicine, is shedding light on what concussions look like in the brain. The findings are stunning. Far from innocuous, invisible injuries, concussions confer tremendous brain damage. That damage has a name: chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). On Tuesday afternoon, researchers at the CSTE released a study about the sixth documented case of CTE in former NFL player Tom McHale, who died in 2008 at the age of 45, and the youngest case to date, an 18-year-old multi-sport athlete who suffered multiple concussions. While CTE in an ex-NFL player's brain may have been expected, the beginnings of brain damage in an 18-year-old brain was a ""shocking"" finding, according to Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts, and co-director of the CSTE. ""We think this is how chronic traumatic encephalopathy starts,"" said McKee. ""This is speculation, but I think we can assume that this would have continued to expand."" CTE has thus far been found in the brains of six out of six former NFL players. ""What's been surprising is that it's so extensive,"" said McKee. ""It's throughout the brain, not just on the superficial aspects of the brain, but it's deep inside."" CSTE studies reveal brown tangles flecked throughout the brain tissue of former NFL players who died young -- some as early as their 30s or 40s. McKee, who also studies Alzheimer's disease, says the tangles closely resemble what might be found in the brain of an 80-year-old with dementia. ""I knew what traumatic brain disease looked like in the very end stages, in the most severe cases,"" said McKee. ""To see the kind of changes we're seeing in 45-year-olds is basically unheard of."" The damage affects the parts of the brain that control emotion, rage, hypersexuality, even breathing, and recent studies find that CTE is a progressive disease that eventually kills brain cells. Chris Nowinski knows well the impact of concussions. He was a football star at Harvard before wrestling professionally with World Wrestling Entertainment. In one moment, his dreams of a long career wrestling were dashed by a kick to his chin. That kick, which caused Nowinski to black out and effectively ended his career, capped a career riddled with concussions. ""My world changed,"" said Nowinski. ""I had depression. I had memory problems. My head hurt for five years."" Nowinski began searching for studies, and what he found startled him. ""I realized when I was visiting a lot of doctors, they weren't giving me very good answers about what was wrong with my head,"" said Nowinski. ""I read [every study I could find] and I realized there was a ton of evidence showing concussions lead to depression, and multiple concussion can lead to Alzheimer's."" Nowinski decided further study was needed, so he founded the Sports Legacy Institute along with Dr. Robert Cantu, a neurosurgeon and the co-director of the CSTE. The project solicits for study the brains of ex-athletes who suffered multiple concussions. Once a family agrees to donate the brain, it is delivered to scientists at the CSTE to look for signs of damage. So far, the evidence of CTE is compelling. The Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, along with other research institutions, has now identified traumatic encephalopathy in the brains of late NFL football players John Grimsley, Mike Webster, Andre Waters, Justin Strzelczyk and Terry Long, in addition to McHale. Grimsley died of an accidental gunshot wound to the chest. Webster, Long and Strzelczyk all died after long bouts of depression, while Waters committed suicide in 2006 at age 44. McHale was found dead last year of an apparent drug overdose. ""Guys were dying,"" said Nowinski. ""The fact of the matter was guys were dying because they played sports 10 or 20 years before."" So far, around 100 athletes have consented to have their brains studied after they die. Ted Johnson was one of the first to sign up. He said he believes that concussions he suffered while playing football explain the anger, depression and throbbing headaches that occasionally still plague him. Johnson said he played through concussions because he, like many other NFL athletes, did not understand the consequences. He has publicly criticized the NFL for not protecting players like him. ""They don't want you to know,"" said Johnson. ""It's not like when you get into the NFL there's a handout that says 'These are the effects of multiple concussions so beware.' "" In a statement, the NFL indicated that their staffs take a cautious, conservative approach to managing concussions. While they support research into the impact of concussions, they maintain that, ""Hundreds of thousands of people have played football and other sports without experiencing any problem of this type and there continues to be considerable debate within the medical community on the precise long-term effects of concussions and how they relate to other risk factors."" The NFL is planning its own independent medical study of retired NFL players on the long-term effects of concussion. ""Really my main reason even for talking about this is to help the guys who are already retired,"" said Johnson. ""[They] are getting divorced, going bankrupt, can't work, are depressed, and don't know what's wrong with them. [It is] to give them a name for it so they can go get help."" ""The idea that you can whack your head hundreds of times in your life and knock yourself out and get up and be fine is gone,"" said Nowinski. ""We know we can't do that anymore. This causes long-term damage.""","NEW: Researchers find start of brain damage in 18-year old athlete who died .

"MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- The lawyer for the main suspect in last year's deadly terrorist attack in Mumbai was removed Wednesday, delaying the high-profile trial that was set to begin. Soldiers patrol in Mumbai on the eve of the trial of a key suspect in last year's attacks in the Indian city. The trial start for Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, 21, is expected to be moved to Thursday as officials scramble to settle the lawyer issue. Kasab is thought to be the only one of 10 gunmen to survive the three-day siege, which killed more than 160 people in November. As the trial was to begin, the judge removed attorney Anjali Waghmare because she also was representing a witness in the case. Waghmare argued that she had no idea that the person was a witness in the terror case, and she was representing this person in a different case. But the judge declared that it was a conflict of interest. An Indian court appointed Waghmare two weeks ago to represent Kasab, and it was unclear who would replace her. Kasab demanded that his attorney be replaced with a Pakistani lawyer. But the judge denied that request and said that a Pakistani lawyer may be able to be brought in as a consultant from outside the courtroom. Kasab, a Pakistani national, faces more than a dozen charges, including murder, conspiracy to wage a war against the nation and terrorism. During the proceedings Wednesday Kasab seemed relaxed and smiled many time at the large crowd of journalists in the courtroom. Kasab also requested newspapers to be brought in so that he could see what the media was writing about him. Prosecutors last month accused him of trying to delay the trial by insisting that the 11,000-page document detailing the charges against him -- which was written in English and the local Marathi language -- be translated into Urdu, the official language of Pakistan. The court rejected his request. Wednesday's trial was to take place in a makeshift court set up in a jail where Kasab -- who has been communicating with the judge via videolink -- is being held. Indian authorities have long blamed the Mumbai attacks on Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based militant outfit, but the group has denied responsibility. The violence initially heightened tensions between the two nuclear states. India has urged Pakistan to destroy what it calls terrorist infrastructure in that country. The two nations are longtime rivals that have fought three wars since their independence from the British, and conducted countering nuclear weapons tests in 1998. CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report.","Main suspect's lawyer removed as she represents a witness in the case .

"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose forthcoming book is ""Late Edition: A Love Story."" Bob Greene says Navy SEALs demonstrate an extraordinary devotion to duty. (CNN) -- There is a beach in Coronado, California, just across the bridge from San Diego. It offers a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean, which is why it attracts tourists who are drawn to the sun. I thought about that beach yesterday, when the news from the Indian Ocean near the Horn of Africa was flashed around the world -- the news that the captain of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama had been rescued from Somali pirates by U.S. forces operating off the USS Bainbridge. That beach in California seems quite placid, even sedate. The historic, red-gabled Hotel del Coronado sits upon it -- the place where the Marilyn Monroe-Jack Lemmon-Tony Curtis movie ""Some Like It Hot"" was filmed. The feeling of the place is one of genteel manners, of delicate tradition. You almost expect to see guests carrying parasols and making reservations to play croquet. But down the beach there is another kind of tradition. That's what I was thinking about on Sunday. When I have stayed on Coronado, I walk down that beach toward the Naval Amphibious Base. I remember a makeshift fence separating the beach from the far reaches of the base. But it was easy to walk around, and no one appeared to take it especially seriously. I haven't been back since September 11, 2001; I would be very surprised if the barriers aren't more formidable now. On that part of the beach, on the outskirts of Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, I saw Navy SEALs in training. Here, the Navy winnows the men who would be SEALs from the ones who fall short. It was a humbling thing to witness. As the Navy itself puts it, SEAL training is like few other competitions: . ""Prospective SEALs go through what is considered by many military experts to be the toughest training in the world. ... The most important trait that distinguishes Navy SEALs from all other military forces is that SEALs are Maritime Special Forces, as they strike from and return to the sea. SEALs (Sea, Air, Land) take their name from the elements in and from which they operate. Their stealth and clandestine methods of operation allow them to conduct multiple missions against targets that larger forces cannot approach undetected."" They looked so young, those prospective SEALs on Coronado beach. The maximum age to apply to be a SEAL is 28. They all know what they're getting into when they sign up, but to see their faces -- including the faces of the ones who were falling behind, who probably weren't going to make the cut, who were gasping for air on the arduous runs along the beach and having trouble during the maneuvers in the ocean -- was to see a devotion to the concept of duty on a level few of the rest of us will ever know. Maybe you, during the recent days when Capt. Richard Phillips was held captive on that lifeboat off the coast of Africa, were asking yourself who in the world could come to his rescue. Who had the training, and the courage, to carry out such a mission. We probably don't ask ourselves that kind of question often enough. Usually, military operations are talked about in the abstract, as if they're lines on a chalkboard, or brightly glowing diagrams on a computer screen. But once in a while, like now, we stop to focus on what we ask of the people who serve in our stead when the task seems all but impossible. Ronald Reagan would sometimes quote a line that summed up our wonder at those who make the choice to serve our country in this way: ""Where do we find such men?"" We find them among us, although we usually don't know it when we see it. On Coronado, on Orange Avenue, there was a bar called McP's, owned by an ex-SEAL named Greg McPartlin. Whenever I would stop in there, groups of guys from the naval base would be having a cheeseburger, maybe listening to a local acoustic band play a guitars-only version of The Beatles' ""We Can Work It Out."" You'd sit among them, and it was easy to forget what brought them to this strip of sand. It wasn't for vacation, or relaxation. Where do we find such men? Sometimes at the next table over, listening to the music. From the Navy SEALs' creed: . ""My loyalty to country and team is beyond reproach. I humbly serve as a guardian to my fellow Americans, always ready to defend those who are unable to defend themselves. I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions. I voluntarily accept the inherent hazards of my profession, placing the welfare and security of others before my own. I serve with honor on and off the battlefield. The ability to control my emotions and my actions, regardless of circumstance, sets me apart from other men. ... In the absence of orders I will take charge, lead my teammates and accomplish the mission. ... I will never quit. I persevere and thrive on adversity. My nation expects me to be physically harder and mentally stronger than my enemies. If knocked down, I will get back up, every time. I will draw on every remaining ounce of strength to protect my teammates and to accomplish our mission. I am never out of the fight."" Where do we find such men? Over the weekend, we learned the answer anew. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Navy SEALs go through training in San Diego .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Piracy off the coast of Somalia can't be stopped until there is some authority to bring pirates to justice, according to the commander of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain. U.S. Vice Admiral William Gortney: Need to hold pirates off Africa's east coast accountable. Because there is no working government in Somalia and no country is willing to take captured pirates, bring them to trial and detain them, there is no deterrent for pirates to stop attacking ships, Vice Admiral William Gortney said at a Pentagon briefing Thursday. ""The problem is there's not a way to -- until we have a mechanism [to hold them] accountable and try them for their actions, there's no way to -- to finish the problem,"" Gortney said. The United States is making a deal with a country in the eastern Africa region to hold and try pirates captured by the U.S.-led Combined Task Force 151, a new maritime anti-piracy mission started earlier this month. He said an official announcement would be made after the deal with the country is official. In the past three months, piracy attacks have averaged about 12 to 14 a month off the east coast of Africa. As of mid-January, the attack numbers are already at the average of the past three months, according to Gortney. ""That [number] should tell you that we're not -- we're not being 100 percent successful on the deterrence of the attempt. And that's where we have to go after,"" Gortney said. The United States is expecting other nations to join the anti-piracy task force, but at the moment, the United States is the only country in the task force with just three ships off of the waters of Somalia. There are ships from some European and Asian countries patrolling the waters independently as well, primarily guarding cargo ships from their own countries. Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.  See how pirate attacks peaked in 2008 » . Pirating off of Somalia has increased during the past four to five years as fishermen from Somalia realize that pirating is more lucrative than fishing. Additionally, pirates are able to get away with the crimes because of the lack of government and overall lawlessness in the country. Gortney said statistically the chances of ships being pirated off of Somalia less than one percent, but it won't be stopped until piracy is ""disincentivized.""","Gortney: No working Somali government, country willing to detain, try accused pirates .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British military officials on Sunday said Prince William had not breached any rules when he used a Royal Air Force helicopter to drop in at his girlfriend's house. Chinhook helicopters are normally used for transporting troops and equipment in war zones. The prince, second in line to the throne, landed a Chinook helicopter -- normally used for transporting troops -- in a field next to the home of Kate Middleton, according to the News of the World tabloid. The paper said the trip had caused fury among some in the military who saw it as a waste of time and money at a time when British forces are thinly-stretched, fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Ministry of Defense said the maneuver was part of a planned training exercise designed to help the prince learn to fly in combat situations. ""Battlefield helicopter crews routinely practice landing in fields and confined spaces away from their airfields as a vital part of their training for operations,"" a statement said. ""These highly honed skills are used daily in conflict zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan."" The Ministry said that due to a shortage of landing fields available for practice, an offer to land near the Middleton house on April 3 was readily accepted. It said no one got on or off the aircraft, which spent 20 seconds on the ground. Britain's air forces have already come under  criticism for allowing William, 25, to fly a Chinook to attend a bachelor party, accompanied by his brother, Prince Harry. William, a second lieutenant in the British Army, graduated as a pilot earlier this month following a detachment to the Royal Air Force.

Asma Firfirey of suburban Cape Town, South Africa, told the Afrikaans newspaper Die Burger that she was on the phone with her sister, Aasiya Zubair Hassan, last week when she heard Hassan tell her husband to calm down. She said she heard Hassan say the two could talk about their impending divorce the following day. Then she heard something that sounded like her sister struggling to breathe, she said. ""I can only imagine how scared and emotional she must have been before she died,"" Firfirey said in the interview, reported in English by South Africa's News 24. Police have charged Hassan's husband, Muzzammil Hassan, with second-degree, or intentional, murder in the death of his wife, according to the Erie County District Attorney's Office. Her decapitated body was found at the offices of Bridges TV, the television network where Muzzammil Hassan was chief executive officer and Aasiya Hassan was general manager. Hassan told Orchard Park police his wife was dead, led officers to her body and was arrested Thursday, said Erie County District Attorney Frank Sedita III. He is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. Orchard Park Police Chief Andrew Benz on Tuesday contradicted a CNN report that quoted him as saying Hassan confessed to the crime. A Buffalo attorney told CNN on Tuesday that he expects to represent Hassan but declined further comment, saying details had not yet been worked out. Hassan came to America from Pakistan 25 years ago and became a successful banker, but he and his wife were troubled by the negative perception of Muslims, Voice of America reported in 2004. Speaking in December 2004, Hassan said his wife, then pregnant, was worried about that perception and ""felt there should be an American Muslim media where her kids could grow up feeling really strong about their identity as an American Muslim."" ""So she came up with the idea and turned to me and said, 'Why don't you do it?' "" he said. ""And I was like, I have no clue about television. I'm a banker. ... And her comment was, 'You have an MBA. Why don't you write a business plan?' "" Bridges TV began as a television network for Muslim-Americans, aimed at overcoming the negative stereotypes associated with the religion. ""There should be a Muslim media,"" Muzzammil Hassan told VOA, ""so that Muslim children growing up in America grow up with the self-confidence and high self-esteem about their identity both as Americans and as Muslims."" In the past few years, according to a former employee who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, Bridges TV transformed itself into more of a cross-cultural network seeking to bridge the gap between all cultures. Most of their employees were not Muslim, the former employee said, and Muzzammil Hassan himself was not devout. Aasiya Hassan filed for divorce February 6, police said, and Muzzammil Hassan was served with divorce papers at the station. That night, he showed up at the couple's home, she notified authorities and he was served with a restraining order. Police are not commenting on details of the crime, except to say the woman's body did not appear to have been moved. They also would not divulge what Muzzammil Hassan told police or the suspected motive. The law firm representing Aasiya Hassan refused to comment, only confirming that she had filed for divorce. Benz told CNN on Tuesday that police had responded to several domestic violence calls at the couple's address, but no one was arrested. Firfirey, as well as a Pakistani woman identifying herself as another of Aasiya Hassan's sisters, characterized her as living in fear. Firfirey said the last time she saw her sister was in May 2008, when she visited South Africa. When she arrived, she was badly injured, and Firfirey's family paid the equivalent of about $3,000 for her to be treated, she said. Aasiya Hassan returned to America, she said, because she wanted to complete her MBA degree and ""didn't want to leave her children with that monster."" She said she calls Muzzammil Hassan ""the fat man with evil eyes."" Aasiya Hassan would have graduated March 6, Firfirey said. A woman in Pakistan using the name Salma Zubair posted on a blog that she is the sister of ""this brutally murdered woman."" ""She lived her 8 years of married life with fear in heart,"" Zubair wrote. ""He had already frightened her enough that she couldn't muster up her guts and leave him, and when she finally did gather that much strength he killed her so brutally. She lived to protect her children from this man and his family and she died doing so."" She said Aasiya Hassan ""had always been a very loving person, not even one person in this world can say a small wrong word about her ... she had always dreamed a life of a happily married family, which she did her best to achieve."" Both women said they were worried about the couple's children, ages 4 and 6. Firfirey said they were being cared for by a colleague of the couple. Muzzammil Hassan also has two older children from a previous marriage. Members of Muzzammil Hassan's family did not return calls from CNN on Monday. The former employee told CNN that Aasiya Hassan was popular at the station and was very kind. Muzzammil Hassan was known among employees for having a temper -- he sometimes would yell at and demean his wife, but at other times appeared to be a loving husband and father, the former employee said. Bridges TV released a statement Monday saying its staff was ""deeply shocked and saddened by the murder of Aasiya Hassan and the subsequent arrest of Muzzammil Hassan. Our deepest condolences and prayers go out to the families of the victim."" Imam Mohamed Hagmagid Ali, vice president of the Islamic Society of North America, said Aasiya Hassan's death serves ""as a wake-up call to call of us, that violence against women is real and cannot be ignored ... the Muslim community is not exempt from this issue. We, the Muslim community, need to take a strong stand against domestic violence."" CNN's Mary Snow contributed to this report.","New York man charged with second-degree murder after wife found beheaded .

"(CNN) -- The sole survivor of Sunday's shooting rampage in Wisconsin ""played dead"" after a sheriff's deputy shot him three times, Wisconsin's attorney general said Tuesday. Tyler Peterson, a sheriff's deputy, shot and killed six people, police said. After Tyler Peterson shot him once, Charlie Neitzel, 21, begged him to stop. But Peterson fired again. Neitzel fell to the floor, was shot a third time, and didn't move. ""Playing dead until Peterson left, Neitzel survived,"" Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen said. Neitzel underwent surgery Tuesday and was in stable condition Tuesday night, a hospital employee told CNN. The families of the six slain young people -- all current or former graduates of Crandon High School in Crandon, Wisconsin, asked that media leave them alone in their grief, Van Hollen told reporters. But the families of the victims also wanted it known that they had met with Peterson's family. ""They hold no animosity toward them,"" Van Hollen said, conveying the families' wishes that the Peterson family be allowed space and time to heal. On Sunday around 2 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) Peterson, a full-time Forest County Sheriff's deputy, went to a party at a home in the small town of Crandon apparently to make amends with an ex-girlfriend, a friend of Peterson's told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Peterson argued with Jordanne Murray, accusing her of dating someone else, said Van Hollen. Peterson lost control after people called him a ""worthless pig,"" Peterson's friend Mike Kegley told the paper. Peterson left the party and got a police-style AR-15 rifle from his truck, forced his way back into the apartment and fired about 30 rounds at about 2:45 a.m. (3:45 a.m. ET). Six people were killed. According to The Associated Press, investigators found three bodies on or next to a couch -- Lindsey Stahl, 14; Aaron Smith, 20; and Bradley Schultz, 20. Murray, 18, was found in the kitchen. Lianna Thomas, 18, was found in a closet, and Katrina McCorkle, 18, was just outside it. Both had apparently been trying to hide, Van Hollen said, according to AP. Neitzel was the last person shot, Van Hollen said. Less than 20 minutes later, a patrolling Crandon police officer, reported hearing gunfire and approached the apartment building to investigate, Van Hollen said. The officer, Greg Carter, 21, said he saw Peterson exit the building with a rifle, and momentarily lost sight of him. Then, Carter ""heard multiple rounds of gunfire"" and Carter's windshield burst, Van Hollen said. Van Hollen said Peterson drove ""aimlessly"" through three Wisconsin counties and made false calls to authorities to ""throw police off his tail."" He eventually stopped in Argonne, Wisconsin, where he spoke to friends and confessed, Van Hollen said. Peterson was killed in a shootout with law officers Sunday after negotiations for his surrender failed. The details of the negotiations are not being released at this time pending an ongoing investigation, Van Hollen said Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- The first guests checked back into the Taj Mahal Palace and the Oberoi-Trident hotels Sunday, marking the reopening of the two luxury venues damaged by terrorist attacks in Mumbai last month. Guests arrive Sunday at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai. Along with new guests, the hotels' five restaurants were booked with diners, representatives of the Taj Mahal said. ""Today has been an incredibly moving day. The Taj has been reopened, after a massive concerted effort, in dedication to all of those who lost their lives in the attacks on Mumbai,"" said Ratan Tata, the chairman of the company that owns the the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. Representatives at the Oberoi-Trident marked the reopening of that hotel with a multi-religion prayer meeting. Watch as the Taj Mahal hotel reopens . ""All the 550 guest rooms, including the executive floors, of the hotel are ready to receive guests,"" a hotel spokesman said, adding the business was reopening with ""heightened security,"" There were still portions of both hotels that could not reopened because of damage, including the Heritage wing of the Taj Mahal and the Oberoi wing of the Oberoi-Trident. The scene Sunday is a far cry from November 26 when the hotel and many other locations in Mumbai were paralyzed by a mass of coordinated attacks. Terrorists using bombs, gunfire and fire caused the deaths of more than 160 people over three days of sieges throughout the city that is India's commercial capital. They took hostages at the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels. The assaults also targeted a historic train station, a Jewish cultural center and other landmarks.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A medical ailment that has worried male members of string sections across the music world for over 30 years has been exposed as a hoax. Male cellists of the world can breathe easy again. A senior British lawmaker confessed to making up the condition known as ""cello scrotum"" -- which relates to chafing from the instrument -- after reading about another musically-related ailment called ""guitarist's nipple"" in the British Medical Journal in 1974. Elaine Murphy, who is a member of The House of Lords and a trained doctor, came clean about the prank she devised with husband John in a letter to the BMJ published on Wednesday. She said: ""Perhaps after 34 years it's time for us to confess that we invented cello scrotum. ""Reading (Dr) Curtis's 1974 letter to the BMJ on guitar nipple, we thought it highly likely to be a spoof and decided to go one further by submitting a letter pretending to have noted a similar phenomenon in cellists, signed by the non-doctor one of us. ""Anyone who has ever watched a cello being played would realize the physical impossibility of our claim."" Murphy's confession may have been hastened by the fact that cello scrotum was referenced by a medical researcher in the BMJ late last year. The article, entitled ""A symphony of maladies,"" focused on health problems among musicians and contained references to such ailments as fiddler's neck, flautist's chin and cellist's chest. Fiona Godlee, editor of the BMJ, told Britain's Independent newspaper: ""It seems the BMJ has been deliciously hoaxed. It is wonderful it has been going all these years and no one realized. ""We frown on misconduct and medical fraud is taken very seriously. But in this case I hope I am right in saying that no harm has been done."" Murphy was made a life peer in 2004 and is active on mental health and ageing issues in the House of Lords.","Elaine Murphy is a member of The House of Lords and a trained doctor .

"MOSCOW, Russia -- Russia declared an end Thursday to its 10-year anti-terror ""operation"" in the autonomous republic of Chechnya. Russian forces have been operating in Chechnya since Boris Yeltsin's order in 1999. The end to the offensive could see the withdrawal of thousands of troops from the Muslim-majority region, where Russia has fought two wars since the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991. The head of the Federal Security Service ""canceled the decree declaring a counterterrorist operation in the territory of the republic as of midnight of April 16,"" Russia's anti-terror committee said. It said it did so to create ""the conditions for the future normalization of the situation in the republic, its reconstruction and development of its socio-economic sphere,"" it said in a statement. The late president Boris Yeltsin ordered the counter-terrorist operation in 1999. Since then, the region has been relatively stable.","Russia declares end to 10-year anti-terror ""operation"" in Chechnya .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- After all the anticipation and hubbub, the weekend is coming to an end and the box office results are here: ""Watchmen"" (No. 1) grossed $55.7 million during its first frame, according to early estimates from Media by Numbers. ""Watchmen"" led the weekend box office, grossing $55.7 million during its first weekend. That's a solid sum, to be sure, although it's certainly on the low end of most projections. ""Watchmen"" premiered in more theaters (3,611) than any other R-rated movie in history, and it averaged an impressive $15,413 per venue, despite a potentially problematic long running time. It also scored the biggest debut of 2009 so far. Nonetheless, the movie's $55.7 million take (including $5.5 million from 124 IMAX screens) is substantially smaller than the $70.9 million that 300, the last R-rated graphic-novel movie from director Zack Snyder, earned on its opening weekend two years ago. And aside from that theater-count statistic (which almost any film could break at any time, really), there will be no major records to report on this weekend (for example, ""Watchmen's"" debut was just the fifth-best opening ever for an R-rated movie). I'd argue, in fact, that this opening is a bit soft, considering the great expectations that came with Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore's landmark comic book -- not to mention ""Watchmen's"" hefty grosses from screenings at midnight on Friday and throughout its first day. After attracting some major initial interest, banking $25.1 million on Friday, the film's audience dropped off dramatically during the weekend: It grossed $19 million on Saturday and is expected to bring in just $11.5 million on Sunday. These are all big numbers, don't get me wrong, but, when combined with the fact that the film got a lukewarm CinemaScore grade of B from an audience that was largely comprised of older men, it all points to a rapid downward trend that may be difficult to reverse in the weeks to come. Elsewhere -- yes, there were other movies playing at the multiplex this weekend! -- a number of films continued to do what ""Watchmen"" must now aspire to, perhaps in vain: They stayed strong deep into their long runs. Tyler Perry's ""Madea Goes to Jail"" (No. 2) grossed $8.8 million on its third weekend; the film, Perry's biggest yet at the box office, has banked $76.5 million to date. ""Taken"" (No. 3) also moved along like the unstoppable force it has been for more than a month now, earning $7.5 million and bringing its six-week sum to $118 million. Best Picture winner ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (No. 4) was next with $6.9 million, which boosted its domestic haul to $125.4 million. And ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" (No. 5) took its eight-week total to $133.6 million thanks to another $4.2 million gross. iReport.com: What did you think of 'Watchmen'? Meanwhile, ""Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience"" (No. 9) completely fell off the map, dropping a staggering 78 percent to gross just $2.8 million. According to Box Office Mojo, that's the 15th biggest second-weekend decline of all time. Overall, the cumulative box office was up nearly 8 percent over the same frame a year ago, when 10,000 B.C. opened big, making this the fifth consecutive ""up"" weekend at the multiplex.

"(CNN) -- Just as ""Y2K"" and its batch of predictions about the year 2000 have become a distant memory, here comes ""Twenty-twelve."" The sun shines through the door of the Seven Dolls Temple, in the Maya ruins of Dzibilchaltun in Mexico. Fueled by a crop of books, Web sites with countdown clocks, and claims about ancient timekeepers, interest is growing in what some see as the dawn of a new era, and others as an expiration date for Earth: December 21, 2012. The date marks the end of a 5,126-year cycle on the Long Count calendar developed by the Maya, the ancient civilization known for its advanced understanding of astronomy and for the great cities it left behind in Mexico and Central America. (Some scholars believe the cycle ends a bit later -- on December 23, 2012.) Speculation in some circles about whether the Maya chose this particular time because they thought something ominous would happen has sparked a number of doomsday theories. The hype also has mainstream Maya scholars shaking their heads. ""There's going to be a whole generation of people who, when they think of the Maya, think of 2012, and to me that's just criminal,"" said David Stuart, director of the Mesoamerica Center at the University of Texas at Austin. ""There is no serious scholar who puts any stock in the idea that the Maya said anything meaningful about 2012.""  Find out more about the history and culture of the Maya » . But take the fact that December 21, 2012, coincides with the winter solstice, add claims the Maya picked the time period because it also marks an alignment of the sun with the center of the Milky Way galaxy, and you have the makings of an online sensation. Type ""2012"" into an Internet search engine and you'll find survival guides, survival schools, predictions and ""official stuff"" to wear, including T-shirts with slogans such as ""2012 The End"" and ""Doomsday 2012."" Theories about what might happen range from solar storms triggering volcano eruptions to a polar reversal that will make the Earth spin in the opposite direction. If you think all of this would make a great sci-fi disaster movie, Hollywood is already one step ahead. ""2012,"" a special-effects flick starring John Cusack and directed by Roland Emmerich, of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" fame, is scheduled to be released this fall. The trailer shows a monk running to a bell tower on a mountaintop to sound the alarm as a huge wall of water washes over what appear to be the peaks of the Himalayas. 'Promoting a hoax' One barometer of the interest in 2012 may be the ""Ask an Astrobiologist"" section of NASA's Web site, where senior scientist David Morrison answers questions from the public. On a recent visit, more than half of the inquiries on the most popular list were related to 2012. ""The purveyors of doom are promoting a hoax,"" Morrison wrote earlier this month in response to a question from a person who expressed fear about the date. A scholar who has studied the Maya for 35 years said there is nothing ominous about 2012, despite the hype surrounding claims to the contrary. ""I think that the popular books... about what the Maya say is going to happen are really fabricated on the basis of very little evidence,"" said Anthony Aveni, a professor of astronomy, anthropology and Native American studies at Colgate University. Aveni and Stuart are both writing their own books explaining the Mayan calendar and 2012, but Stuart said he's pessimistic that people will be interested in the real story when so many other books are making sensational claims. Dozens of titles about 2012 have been published and more are scheduled to go on sale in the coming months. Current offerings include ""Apocalypse 2012,"" in which author Lawrence Joseph outlines ""terrible possibilities,"" such as the potential for natural disaster. But Joseph admits he doesn't think the world is going to end. ""I do, however, believe that 2012 will prove to be... a very dramatic and probably transformative year,"" Joseph said. The author acknowledged he's worried his book's title might scare people, but said he wanted to alert the public about possible dangers ahead. He added that his publisher controls the book's title, though he had no issue with the final choice. ""If it had been called 'Serious Threats 2012' or 'Profound Considerations for 2012,' it would have never gotten published,"" Joseph said. Growing interest . Another author said the doom and gloom approach is a great misunderstanding of 2012. ""The trendy doomsday people... should be treated for what they are: under-informed opportunists and alarmists who will move onto other things in 2013,"" said John Major Jenkins, whose books include ""Galactic Alignment"" and who describes himself as a self-taught independent Maya scholar. Jenkins said that cycle endings were all about transformation and renewal -- not catastrophe -- for the Maya. He also makes the case that the period they chose coincides with an alignment of the December solstice sun with the center of the Milky Way, as viewed from Earth. ""Two thousand years ago the Maya believed that the world would be going through a great transformation when this alignment happened,"" Jenkins said. But Aveni said there is no evidence that the Maya cared about this concept of the Milky Way, adding that the galactic center was not defined until the 1950s. ""What you have here is a modern age influence [and] modern concepts trying to garb the ancient Maya in modern clothing, and it just doesn't wash for me,"" Aveni said. Meanwhile, he and other scholars are bracing for growing interest as the date approaches. ""The whole year leading up to it is going to be just crazy, I'm sorry to say,"" Stuart said. ""I just think it's sad, it really just frustrates me. People are really misunderstanding this really cool culture by focusing on this 2012 thing. It means more about us than it does about the Maya.""","December 21, 2012, marks the end of a 5,126-year cycle on a Mayan calendar .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- U.S. envoy George Mitchell was in Israel on Thursday for his first visit since right-wing politician Benjamin Netanyahu became prime minister. U.S. envoy George Mitchell, right, meets Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman on Thursday in Jerusalem. It is Mitchell's third visit to the region since President Obama appointed him as special envoy for Middle East peace. Mitchell plans to meet with Netanyahu and other Israeli politicians Thursday, as well as Palestinian leaders -- including President Mahmoud Abbas -- in the West Bank and Jerusalem on Friday. The former senator and seasoned diplomat has not been shy in articulating the U.S. desire to see a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has led to speculation that the new Israeli government and the Obama administration may find themselves on a collision course. Netanyahu has indicated he wants serious negotiations with the Palestinians to continue, but he has not explicitly stated his support for Palestinian statehood. Questions about the new Israeli government's commitment to a negotiated peace process came up when the new foreign minister, nationalist politician Avigdor Lieberman, declared the Annapolis process ""null and void."" The Annapolis process, launched by the Bush administration in 2007, paved the way for the resumption of Israeli and Palestinian talks after they stopped earlier in the decade. After meeting Lieberman on Thursday morning, Mitchell said he had reiterated the U.S. stance. ""U.S. policy favors, with respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a two-state solution which would have a Palestinian state living in peace alongside the Jewish state of Israel,"" Mitchell said. ""We look forward also to efforts to achieve a comprehensive peace throughout the region."" Lieberman said the two men had a ""great opportunity to exchange some ideas"" and spoke about close cooperation. ""We spoke to coordinate our position regarding the Palestinian issue, regarding the area problems,"" he said. ""We are looking forward to the next meeting for some really deep dialogue about security, about economy, about all problems in the entire region."" The Israeli foreign minister said Israel will do everything necessary to improve the Palestinians' economic situation. But in a statement after his meeting with Mitchell, he emphasized that Israel expects an ""unequivocal commitment"" from the international community to Israel's security and to the Jewish state. Mitchell met Wednesday night with Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who told the U.S. envoy that the countries' bilateral relationship is ""deep and close."" ""It is possible to reach cooperation and understanding on all issues that are on the table,"" said Barak. The issue of Iran and its nuclear program was also a topic Thursday. After Mitchell met with Israeli President Shimon Peres, the president said he emphasized dialogue on the issue. ""It is our common interest that dialogue with Iran will expose if there is an opportunity with Iran or is it all a hoax,"" Peres said. ""We all want a world that is clean of nuclear bombs, but the problem is that those holding the bombs are religious fanatics, extremists, that do not cringe from all methods of killing. ""We need to create a wide international cooperation regarding the matter of Iran,"" he said. ""All this talk about a possible attack by Israel in Iran are not true. The solution to Iran is not a military solution."" Lieberman said the subject of Iran is a ""major problem"" for Israel and the whole region. ""If you are looking for a stable solution to the Palestinian problem, before everything else you have [to] stop the intensification and the spreading of the Iranian threat,"" Lieberman said in his statement. CNN Jerusalem Bureau Chief Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","George Mitchell to meet with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .

"(CNN) -- The two young women were as different as could be when they met in a small farming village outside Uganda's capital in 2004. Orphans perform at the opening ceremony for their new home in Mutungo, Uganda. Brittany Merrill was a 19-year-old Southern Methodist University broadcast journalism student from an affluent family in suburban Atlanta, Georgia. She was teaching literature in Uganda for the summer when she decided to visit Mutungo, a crowded shantytown of mud huts and wooden shacks, where children in torn clothes ran around in bare feet, and people lingered in the noisy streets to avoid the oppressive heat inside their homes. At 22 years old, Sarah Kamara felt God had called on her to take in homeless children begging on Mutungo's streets. In addition to her own daughter, Kamara was caring for 23 children in her one-room home. Some were AIDS orphans, others had been abandoned by families who had too many children. But Kamara took them in, alienating herself from neighbors, relatives and her husband, who briefly separated from her in protest. Despite Kamara's broken English and Merrill's culture shock, the two found common ground in their compassion for the children, whose zeal for life was unmitigated by the poverty, disease and death that had brought them to Kamara's home. ""They taught me about what is meaningful in this world and gave me purpose,"" Merrill said of the children. ""Their love and faith has challenged my heart. They shook me out of my complacency."" Merrill left Uganda determined to help Kamara realize her dream of opening a full-fledged orphan home, where sets of ""mamas"" and ""uncles"" would care for children in separate living spaces, nurturing their emotional, physical and spiritual needs. Four years and roughly $800,000 later, the two brought their vision to life with the opening of the Ranch on Jesus Orphanage in March. The home, which will accommodate 180 orphans at capacity, is named after the nonprofit ministry that Kamara and her husband, Theophilius, started after they met Merrill in 2004. Local dignitaries and the orphans' relatives, who couldn't afford to care for them, attended the opening. It was a rousing celebration of song and dance, ceremonial ribbon-cuttings and speeches that highlighted how cultural barriers crumbled before the wills of the two women.  See images from the opening ceremony » . ""Here in Africa, ladies don't do such big, big things,"" Kamara said after the ceremony. ""I'm a young lady, and Brittany is also a young lady, but the Lord has used us in a great, great way."" After Merrill's first trip to Uganda, she knew her life's path had been irrevocably altered. She started using her free time to take classes in nonprofit management at SMU and read up on fundraising before securing a loan from her father to buy property for the orphanage. She expanded upon her vision in her senior year, forgoing a social life so she could draw up facility plans and file paperwork for a nonprofit. ""My friends thought I had fallen off the face of the Earth,"" she said. She also began fundraising in earnest, sharing her vision with family and friends at fundraising dinners in Atlanta and Dallas, Texas, and relying on word of mouth to expand her pool of donors. By the end of 2005, she had put her vision on paper with the creation of the Ugandan Children's Orphanage Fund. After graduation, her dream of becoming a journalist was replaced by new goals. As her friends started marrying and taking jobs stateside, Merrill was visiting Uganda with greater frequency, bringing along more recent graduates from the United States each time. ""I'd never been involved in community service, never planned on being in Africa, this wasn't my plan for my life, so to watch my own heart change to learn to love people who are different from me in every possible way, that's something that has really changed me and the way I see the world, and my role in the world in the context of others,"" she said. Merrill's dedication to Uganda grew as the Mutungo Orphanage Project made headway, first with the construction of a temporary orphanage, and then with the groundbreaking in 2007 of a facility consisting of family-style apartments for the children and caregivers. Meanwhile, the Kamaras founded Ranch on Jesus Ministries, a nonprofit that runs the orphanage and a nearby school serving children from the orphanage and others from Mutungo. As Merrill's relationship with the community grew, so did her ambitions for development projects in the region. By the time she moved to Uganda in 2007, the Ugandan Children's Orphanage Fund had become the Ugandan American Partnership Organization, and the foundation had started two more projects with the help of Ugandan entrepreneurs and community leaders and more fundraising on the part of Merrill and board members in Dallas, Atlanta and Birmingham, Alabama. ""When our relationships are bad, the projects suffer. When our relationships are strong, our projects thrive, they don't feel forced,"" Merrill said. ""To me, it's really amazing to see how some of the most beautiful and bountiful relationships come out of transcending race, culture and economic status."" So far, the Amaazi Project has successfully drilled six water wells in rural villages in Eastern and Northern Uganda, providing more than 3,000 villagers with clean water.

"(CNN)  -- Donald Trump visited ""Larry King Live"" on Wednesday night to tout his new book, ""Think Like a Champion."" In a wide-ranging interview, Trump shared his thoughts on how to prosper in this economy, Bernie Madoff, how President Obama is doing, taxes and his daughter's love life. On CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Wednesday night, Donald Trump said it's a great time for entrepreneurs. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: Why this book? Donald Trump: A lot of people wanted me to do a book right now about these troubled times that we're all in. And it's been sort of interesting. They're great times, as an entrepreneur. I don't think I've ever seen better times as an entrepreneur. But the world is a mess, and the country is a mess. King: Why [is it a] good time for an entrepreneur and not necessarily for others? Trump: Well, this is a time for smart people. This is a time for entrepreneurial people. This is a great time for people like me -- and maybe people like you, Larry, because I know you're a great investor. ... Weren't you involved with [Bernie] Madoff? King: A little bit, yes. You weren't, huh? How did you resist him? Trump: Honestly, I got lucky. He might have duped me like he did a lot of other people. He is a disaster. But now he's where he belongs. King: With troubled times like this for the average guy, is this the time to think like a champion?  Watch Larry King's entire interview with Donald Trump » . Trump:  This is the best time to think like a champion. As an example, the house is being foreclosed. You go see your bank -- maybe you can make a deal, maybe you can't. But you can make a deal with a bank on another house, and much better than the one you're living in. ... They'll do any deal to get rid of their product. They have houses by the thousands. And you go see that bank and you make a deal. King: How do you assess [Barack Obama]? Trump: Well, I really like him. I think that he's working very hard. He's trying to rebuild our reputation throughout the world. The previous administration was a total disaster, a total catastrophe. And, you know, the world looks at us differently than they used to. ... He was handed a pretty bad deck of cards. And I'm not saying I agree with everything he's doing. ... I do agree with what they're doing with the banks. Whether they fund them or nationalize them, it doesn't matter, but you have to keep the banks going. King: Do you assess him as a champion? Trump: Oh, yes, he's a champion. I mean, he won against all odds. When he first announced, people were giving him virtually no chance. And he's just done something that's amazing. King: Is fear harmful in this [economic] situation, Donald, or is it realistic? Trump: Well, I think it's realistic. People are afraid. They're scared. They're losing their jobs. They're losing their homes. And certainly there is a word known as fear, and there's nothing wrong with being fearful. But you have to do something about it. And that's what I write about in the book. You go out. You go to the right place, where there's better employment. You get a trade where they really need people. King: Have you had to lay off people? Because it seems everyone has had to do that. Trump: It's a sad thing, but whether it's ""The Apprentice"" or not,  the fact is you have to say to some people: ""You're fired."" The world is different. King: You said that this is a good time to buy real estate. What about financing? What if you want to buy and you can't get the mortgage? Trump: Larry, this is a great time to buy real estate. And as far as financing is concerned, the only financing you should be thinking about is seller financing. If the seller won't give you financing, don't do it, because the banks are not doing their job. They're not providing financing for deals. King: New York state is planning a so-called millionaire's tax. It would affect those with incomes starting at $300,000. Yea or nay? Trump: Well, it's a ridiculous thing. Albany is going to destroy  ... this state. And they are raising taxes on rich people. The rich people have lots of options, Larry. One option is Palm Beach, Florida. You move down to Palm Beach; it's not the worst thing in the world. I don't have to live on Fifth Avenue. I don't have to live on Park Avenue. It's hard, psychologically, for me to leave, but very easy physically. King: Why don't patriots want to pay taxes? Trump: Well, I don't know that that's necessarily unpatriotic. I think they want to pay taxes. Obviously, you have to pay taxes. But they want to pay a reasonable tax, and they don't want to see the money squandered. Money in this country is being squandered. King: OK. But then we would debate reasonable. Trump: Well, you always debate reasonable. I think unreasonable is the war in Iraq. I mean, there's $1 trillion right there. And, more importantly, thousands of people -- both on our side and the other side -- hundreds of thousands of people killed and maimed and so badly hurt, I think it's just a shame. Now, to me, that's unreasonable. And, by the way, ... Saddam Hussein did not knock down the World Trade Center. King: Has the economy at all cramped your lifestyle? Anything you had to change? Trump: No, because I think I understand life. I think I understand how to live. I'm enjoying my life. I don't really live in an as extravagant a way as people think. As an entrepreneur, this is the best time I think I've ever seen in business. King: There's buzz that your beautiful daughter Ivanka is engaged or getting engaged. What's up? Trump: She has a beautiful boyfriend. He's a great guy, but they are not engaged. King: Would you like them to? Is he the kind of guy you would except as a son-in-law? Trump: He certainly is a wonderful guy. But it's all up to her. If she's happy, I'm happy.","Trump advises to take advantage of low prices, get seller to do the financing .

"(CNN) -- President Obama visits Mexico with many issues on the table, but reinstating the ban on assault weapons in the U.S. isn't likely to be one on which the two countries can reach agreement. Mexican federal police officers this week display an arsenal seized near the U.S. border. Mexican officials say criminals use assault weapons from the U.S. in the violent border region. Mexican President Felipe Calderon and Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., say reinstating the ban would stop the deadly flow of weapons across the border. Under the Clinton administration in 1994, Congress banned possession of 19 military-style assault weapons. The ban was allowed to expire 10 years later during the Bush administration. Earlier this year, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said that Obama would like to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons, noting, ""I think that will have a positive impact in Mexico at a minimum."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last month that as a senator, she supported a measure to reinstate it. And the urban policy section of the White House Web site says Obama and Vice President Joe Biden ""support making the expired federal Assault Weapons Ban permanent."" Obama still supports reinstating the ban, as he did during the presidential campaign, but there are no plans to reintroduce it anytime soon, according to an administration official. Obama thinks more can be done to stop the illegal flow of weapons to Mexico within existing laws, the official said, noting that the president has taken steps to deploy more law enforcement to curb the illegal flows of drugs, weapons and cash in both directions across the border. The administration is unaware of any broad-based efforts in Congress to reinstate the ban, the official said. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told CBS on Thursday that reinstating the ban ""simply is not part of the plan that we're talking about here.""  Watch what Napolitano says about drug violence » . The Obama administration says the U.S. shares responsibility for the situation in Mexico, but as far as the ban goes, ""there's a lot on our plate,"" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said.  Watch what's on the table for Obama's trip to Mexico » . Gun rights advocates stress that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to own firearms without restriction. Gun control supporters interpret the amendment to mean that states shall keep militias but that an individual's right to own firearms may be restricted. Those who support the assault weapons ban as a way to curb violence cite figures from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that say American gun sellers supply the Mexican drug cartels with 95 percent to 100 percent of their guns. But others say that claim cannot be substantiated -- and argue that less that 20 percent of weapons used in crimes in Mexico are traced to the U.S. Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president and chief executive officer of the National Rifle Association of America, says U.S. rights are not the cause of Mexico's wrongs. In a commentary on CNN.com, LaPierre wrote that to believe U.S. freedoms are fueling the violence ""you have to believe these butchers and beheaders break every Mexican law they want except Mexican gun laws, which they honor -- while they break American gun laws."" ""Everything Mexico's murderous thugs are doing is already illegal. At issue is not the absence of law, but the absence of political will to enforce the laws that both nations already possess,"" he wrote. On the other side, however, there are those who say loopholes in America's gun laws fuel violence in both Mexico and the United States. ""We need to realize that the Mexican drug cartels are arming themselves here because our gun laws have loopholes so large that criminals and gun traffickers can easily drive gun-laden trucks through them,"" former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter of the late U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, wrote in a commentary for CNN.com. ""We need to prevent Mexican criminals and the traffickers who supply them from buying guns by changing our gun laws and strengthening U.S. law enforcement's ability to crack down on corrupt gun dealers."" On the eve of Obama's arrival, Calderon told ABC he thought the weapons ban was ""very good legislation."" ""During that period, we didn't suffer a lot, like we suffered in the four or five years,"" he said. And Sarukhan told CBS this weekend, ""There's a direct correlation between the expiration of the assault weapons ban and our seizures of assault weapons."" He said, ""We cannot determine how Congress and the administration will move on this. What we will say is that this is one of the instruments by reinstating the ban that could have a profound impact on the number and the caliber of weapons going down to Mexico."" Obama was to meet Thursday with Calderon in Mexico City ahead of his trip to Trinidad and Tobago for the Summit of the Americas. But Mexico isn't the only consideration when it comes to gun control. In the United States, gun control is a wedge issue -- and one that can carry serious political ramifications. Democrats tend to shy away from remarks that could be interpreted as anti-gun, especially in swing states and districts. (Remember the frenzy that ensued after then-candidate Obama said people in small towns get bitter and ""cling to guns or religion""?) Democrats are usually thought of as the party more likely to enforce ownership restrictions, while Republicans are associated with ownership rights. As a candidate, Obama promised, ""I'm not going to take away your guns.'' Any other message would have been unpopular in the traditionally Republican states he won such as North Carolina and Virginia. Other Democrats, such as Sens. Mark Warner and Jim Webb of Virginia, also are getting elected with the help of NRA supporters. Even so, with a Democrat in the White House and a Democrat-controlled Congress, there's been a surge in requests for background checks of potential gun buyers, according to the FBI, and some gun owners say they think restrictions are somewhere on Obama's to-do list. Asked Thursday if it's just too politically difficult now to reinstate the ban, Gibbs said, ""I think the president believes that we can have a greater outcome in the short term working to enforce the laws that are on our books.""","Mexico: U.S. ban on assault weapons would curtail flow of weapons into country .

"Editor's note: Journalist Karl Penhaul spent several weeks tracking the gangs of the Mexican underworld, the corrupt officials who support them and the cops trying to halt the violence. This is the second of three exclusive reports. Part one looked at the violent rules gangs live by. The faithful leave this ""Holy Death"" statue offerings including cigarettes and cocaine, visible in the nose. CULIACAN, Mexico (CNN) -- A baseball cap dangles from a cement cross. The slogan on the hat reads ""power, money, respect."" On the brim there's the logo of the classic gangster movie ""Scarface."" Etched on the gravestone, the words: ""Jesus Guadalupe Parra. 12 December 1986 to 25 August 2008."" ""Lupito,"" as friends and family knew him, went down in a hail of bullets before he reached 22. Authorities said he died alongside three others in a gunfight with a rival drug gang high in the Sierra Madre mountain  range that is the backbone of Mexico's Pacific coast state of Sinaloa. A printed banner draped over his tomb offers a deeper insight. It shows a photo of him alongside a marijuana plantation and an AK-47 assault rifle fitted with a 100-round ammunition drum. The drab grave of this cartel triggerman, at the Jardines de Humaya cemetery in state capital Culiacan, stands in stark contrast to the mausoleums of dead capos, or drug bosses. Those are elaborate two- and three-story constructions, some perhaps 25 feet high, made of bullet-proof glass, Italian marble and spiral iron staircases. A bricklayer at work in the cemetery told me the fanciest cost between $75,000 and $150,000. He said grateful drug barons often pay for loyal hitmen to be buried here, the city's toniest graveyard. Like so many other people we've met over the last few weeks, he declined to give his name or speak on camera. ""I can't. El patron [the boss] would kill me,"" he said. Days later I track down Lupito's cousin, Giovanni Garcia, on the phone. He's an undertaker and by coincidence he took the call that Lupito had been shot. ""My cousin loved that way of life,"" Garcia said briefly before turning down a recorded interview. ""We can't talk. You must understand how things are around here these days. It's not a good time."" That Sunday, I linger at Lupito's graveside. Three young men show up. They look about the same age as the dead gunman, the same cropped-hair, one heavily scarred around his eye. In the breeze they struggle to light a dozen foot-high candles. I introduce myself. A few grunts later and I can see this conversation is going nowhere fast. ""We couldn't make it to the burial. This is the first time we've come to pay our respects,"" one of them explained. He never offered his name. Drug rivalries have been known to spill over at funerals so many mourners opt to stay away leaving only the closest relatives to bury their dead quietly and without public complaints. I stick around hoping to meet more talkative mourners. My wait is cut short. A fourth man appears between the tombstones some 20 yards away, apparently having seen me. As he talks into a phone I hear him say: ""Hey, take your chance. Go grab f**king baldy."" I look around. No other bald men in sight -- just me. Time to leave. At Jardines de Humaya and across town at the 21 de Marzo cemetery, rows of recently dug graves are filled with the young foot soldiers of Mexico's drug war. A crosscheck of their names in the obituary columns of the local newspaper reveal tales of men in their late teens and early 20s, gunned down in firefights, shot in cold blood on their doorsteps or killed in prison clashes. Jesus Gaston earns around $40 for every three graves he digs. But he can see the lure of easy money in the drug trade is little more than a mirage. ""The easy money lasts for just a few days because it's all about time before they kill you too. You kill somebody and somebody will come back for you,"" he said. ""Some how, some way they will find you."" When the reality boils down to kill or be killed, it's unsurprising the hitmen and the narco-traffickers want to improve their odds of survival. Most days, you can hear a brass band or a cowboy trio thumping out tunes in a small building on a Culiacan side street. It's a shrine to a highway robber called Jesus Malverde. In the century since he died he's become known as the patron saint of the drug trade.  Watch men pay respects to their narco-saint » . Men in cowboy hats and ostrich-skin boots duck in and out of view. Some try to conceal their faces behind a musician's trombone or tuba. The day I dropped in, one man was paying around $600 for a band to play for three hours. Off camera he told me it was his way of repaying a favor to Malverde. I asked him about that favor and he said he was celebrating a bumper harvest -- of beans and corn. He said he was shy about appearing on camera. I told another man, who gave his name as ""Rosario,"" that he looked like a stereotypical narco. He had the ostrich-skin cowboy boots and shaved head. Besides that he seemed to be spending a small fortune, by Mexican standards, on live music, foot-high candles and fresh flowers to place at Malverde's altar. Rosario laughed off my suggestion and laughed again in my face as he told me he was paying tribute to Malverde after a good few months working as a carpet fitter in Arizona. It was refreshing to find a straight-talking trombone player at the shrine, Jaime Laveaga. He makes his living playing music and he's clear about who his main clients are. ""It sounds bad to say it but Culiacan is a city with a big drug mafia. They like brass band music and they love to celebrate -- 15th birthdays, weddings, family birthdays. They even celebrate their dogs' birthdays,"" he explained. Needless to say, the Catholic Church takes a dim view of those who worship Malverde and another growing cult known as the ""Holy Death,"" which critics say is also popular among thieves and narcos. ""People are looking for easy solutions where they don't have to make any sacrifices. If they don't find any support for their killings or their drug trafficking from the Catholic Church then they look for other options,"" Father Esteban Robles, spokesman for the Culiacan diocese told me. ""They're looking for something that will justify their actions."" Tomorrow, Penhaul examines how the gangs dispose of their victims and what officials are doing to stem the violence.","Graveyards in Mexican town show tributes to gang leaders and hitmen .

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- David and Christina Macfarlane always dreamed of opening a restaurant. And with David's background as a White House chef, they certainly have the in-house culinary ability. David and Christina Macfarlane in their Minneapolis restaurant, L'Ecosse. But they never imagined they'd be doing it in one of the toughest economic times ever, and they wondered if it would even be possible. ""The banks were like, 'You're opening a restaurant now?' "" Christina says. "" 'Yeah, we're opening a restaurant now.' "" David was born in Glasgow, Scotland, but moved to the United States with his family in his early teens and soon found his passion for the palate. Soon after high school, he joined the U.S. Navy, where he ultimately spent years cooking -- two of which were spent in the kitchen at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as a chef for President Clinton at the beginning of his first term in 1992. Looking at a picture of himself and the former president, David describes a favorite memory. ""He said that was the best meal he ever ate. I was pretty geeked about that.""  See more about that favorite meal » . But the Macfarlanes wanted more time as a family -- something not suited to David's high-profile job. They moved a number of times before settling down in the Minneapolis, Minnesota, suburbs where, most recently, David worked for Fusion Culinary -- until his position was eliminated, that is. Christina says that as dismayed as David was over the job loss, she saw it as ""a blessing."" ""I thought, 'Thank you, Lord! Thank you, Lord!' "" she says, adding that she saw it as the perfect opportunity to follow through with their dream. Now, despite the battered economy, the two stand behind the bar in their new restaurant, L'Ecosse, which, incidentally, is French for ""Scotland."" However, they have a slightly different take on the menu than perhaps they would have had if times were perkier. ""We went to over a dozen restaurants looking at menus, pricepoints, [and] realizing the struggles in the economy,"" Christina recalls. The two concluded that while people are still eating out, they aren't seeking ""fancy"" food -- in other words, they weren't seeking the type of fare one might typically associate with state dinners at the White House. David says that's all a misconception anyway. ""Comfort food,"" he says. ""That's what the president wanted most."" Some of the president's favorite foods, David says were nachos and salsa, tuna sandwiches, or just warm milk and cookies. ""[President Clinton] wasn't looking for any of the fancy frou-frou stuff. We did that for state dinners or we did that for dignitaries that would come in, but ... at lunchtime when the president would be in the Oval Office by himself, [he'd say] 'Lemme have a tuna sandwich.' "" At L'Ecosse, tuna and warm cookies are on the menu. Keeping with his Scottish upbringing, David's menu also is largely UK-centric: meat pies and fish and chips are two of the specialties. He does it all with fresh, local ingredients and says he can keep prices down because he does a lot of the work himself and with the help of a very minimal staff.  Watch the chef talk about keeping it simple » . Everything on the breakfast and lunch menus is priced under $10, and the two say that when they expand to a full dinner menu once their liquor license is approved, they want to keep prices similarly low. ""The reason we did that was so nobody had sticker shock,"" David says. ""They're very good items, but they're also inexpensive items and you're not going to break the bank."" ""If you want to come in and get Bill Clinton's favorite, it doesn't have to be $15 during the day. And that's what we want people to understand -- we understand where you're at."" As Christina puts it, ""You are going to get great food that your mother used to make for you."" And, ideally, the bill won't send you into debt.","Former White House chef opens restaurant to serve ""comfort food""

"(CNN) -- Thousands of mourners filled a Tracy, California, high school gym Thursday to remember slain 8-year-old Sandra Renee Cantu. Sandra Cantu, 8, had been missing almost two weeks before her body was found. The little girl made national headlines after she went missing March 27 from a mobile home park in Tracy where she lived with her family. She was on her way to a friend's home and her playful skipping down an alley was caught by a surveillance camera. Police later found her body stuffed into a suitcase and submerged in a pond at a nearby dairy farm. Photos of Sandra, flowers and stuffed animals covered the front of the stage. Family members, friends and state dignitaries memorialized the child during a ceremony that lasted just over an hour. The printed program called the memorial service ""A Celebration of Life,"" and organizers said they hoped the service would help ease the pain the community has suffered since Sandra's disappearance. ""We are left with the haunting image of her skipping on the streets of Tracy. But today she is skipping on the streets of gold, into the arms of a loving God"", said Brent Ives, mayor of Tracy. Cindy Sasser, principal at Jacobsen Elementary School told mourners, ""We should all strive to be like Sandra -- always smiling, wanting to help, to look out for others and to be caring."" The service included a video that showcased some of the family's favorite photos. People from across California attended, filling the gymnasium, cafeteria and the football stadium at West High School. Melissa Huckaby, 28, a Sunday school teacher who lived in the same mobile home park as Sandra's family, has been charged with murder, kidnapping, the performance of a lewd and lascivious act on a child under 14, and rape by instrument. If convicted, she would face the death penalty or life in prison without parole, San Joaquin County District Attorney James Willett said this week. A private memorial service for Sandra was held Wednesday. Her casket, signed by classmates, was taken to a nearby burial site by a horse-drawn carriage.","NEW: Photo montage shown at service for Sandra at a high school in Tracy .

"HONOLULU, Hawaii (CNN) -- It's been more than a year since a racial slur threatened to end the television career of Duane ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" Chapman. But the incident still weighs heavily on his mind. Duane ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" Chapman watches his son's baseball game this month in Honolulu, Hawaii. A&E briefly suspended his top-rated reality show in late 2007, and his reputation was on the line. Now, with his show back on the air and at the top of the network's ratings list, Chapman insists that he does not want the controversy to be forgotten. ""They said, 'It'll pass,' and I said to the guy, 'You know what? I won't let it.' "" Chapman, 56, spoke candidly about accusations of racism on a recent windy Saturday afternoon on the sidelines of 8-year-old son Garry's baseball game. It was his other son, Tucker, who recorded a profanity-laced conversation with his father and reportedly sold the recording -- which included Chapman repeatedly using the ""n-word"" -- to the National Enquirer in 2007. Some African-American leaders called for the cancellation of his show. Chapman said he was advised to lay low for several weeks, but he refused. ""All the spin doctors ... all those guys told me, 'Dog, say that you were this, say you were that, [but] if you go out there, you're done.' I said, 'I'm going out in a hail of glory. You may call me a convict ... but you ain't gonna call me something I'm not. I'm going out swinging.'"" Chapman said his meetings with leaders of the black community were more than an attempt to redeem himself in the public eye and get his show back on the air. In a February 8, 2008, foreword to his book, ""You Can Run But You Can't Hide,"" he writes that ""giving up cussing is just the first step toward my evolution as a human."" He said he was referring to his use of the racial slur, which he admits -- even on the recording -- knowing that it would spark public outrage. But as a former prison inmate of mixed ethnicity -- he is part Native American -- Chapman said he felt he could use the word without it defining him as a racist. ""I was with 38,000 black men at the age of 22 in the '70s, the [prison] guards -- whether they're black or white -- called them that [the slur] every day,"" he said. ""Once I said it and met with leaders of the black community and realized what that word meant, that's when I said, 'I will never again utter that word. Ever.' "" He said, ""I don't give a damn that [it] was a private call they burglarized; I knew not to do that. I didn't know not to say the word because what it would do, but I do now. Now if you catch me [saying it], you won't have to stop my show, I'll resign."" Controversy is something that Chapman draws on; it defines his character both publicly and privately. He ran with motorcycle gangs before he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to a five-year prison term in 1977. He maintains his innocence and served a fraction of the sentence. His determination to prove he was the world's best bounty hunter led him to Mexico in 2003, where he and his team captured the heir to the Max Factor cosmetics fortune, Andrew Luster, who was convicted in absentia on charges of rape. The Mexican government charged Chapman and his team with kidnapping and demanded their extradition, but the charges later were dropped. His life story of an ex-con-turned-vigilante is the hallmark of his celebrity and leads many people to tune in to his show, which began in 2004. Chapman said his fans perceived the racial slur incident differently. ""Not one black person to this day has walked up to me and said anything bad; it's all been the whites,"" he said. ""[Others said], 'You know here's a bounty hunter, was convicted, went to prison, 30 years later he's arrested 7,000 people. You think he might say a couple bad words.' That's the good things that were said to me."" His 10-year-old daughter, Bonnie Jo, heard about what happened on the radio. ""And she goes, 'Dad, you know you can't use that [word], you're not a rapper. OK, love you, Dad, see you.' And I'm like, 'And is that what your friends are saying?' 'Yep, they know you're not a rapper. They know you're Dog the Bounty Hunter. And it was over, just like that."" While some of his viewers have forgotten the controversy, Chapman does not want it to go away -- particularly the accusations that were leveled against him in the media. ""You better not forget the s*** you put me through over that. I ain't lettin' 'em forget it. Ever. You think black guys forget it? It hurts my feelings to hear it [the slur]. So, yeah, there's such a thing as passing, but I never heard of that. It ain't passing."" He added, ""I understand the saying now, 'Lest ye forget.' Don't ever forget that. Please don't forget that, that I went through that. That I learned.""","Use of slur threatened to end TV career of Duane ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" Chapman .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A 47-year-old charity worker who says she has never been kissed is now a YouTube sensation after a singing performance that wowed the notoriously harsh talent judge Simon Cowell. The YouTube video of Susan Boyle's performance has had more than 5 million hits. Susan Boyle, from West Lothian in Scotland, appeared on the television show ""Britain's Got Talent"" last weekend with an inauspicious start. Slightly plump and with short brown curly hair, Boyle stood somewhat uncomfortably in the middle of the stage wearing a gold lace sheath. She told the judges and the audience of the show that she was single, she lived with her cat, Pebbles, and she had never been kissed. ""I'm trying to be a professional singer,"" Boyle asserted, as the audience laughed. ""I'm going to make that audience rock."" When she added that she wanted to be as famous as Elaine Paige, who's been called the ""first lady of British musical theater,"" some members of the audience snickered and rolled their eyes. But after Boyle sang the first few notes of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" from the musical ""Les Miserables,"" the audience erupted in wild cheers and applause, and two of the three judges' jaws dropped. The applause lasted the length of her performance, which ended with the crowd on its feet. Cowell, who also serves as a judge on ""American Idol"" and who's known for his stinging criticism of those he deems to have no talent, said Boyle's performance was fantastic. ""I knew the minute you walked out on that stage that we were going to hear something extraordinary,"" he proclaimed.

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- Basketball great Charles Barkley began serving a three-day sentence in Arizona's infamous Tent City on Saturday, jailed by the same sheriff whose autobiography he endorsed 12 years ago. Charles Barkley bristled at the implication he should be wearing stripes instead of a red-and-bue sweatsuit. ""You come here when you screw up,"" Barkley said at a news conference hours after he reported at the Maricopa County jail. ""I don't blame anybody for this situation but myself."" Barkley, 45, pleaded guilty last month to misdemeanor drunken-driving charges stemming from a New Year's Eve arrest after he left a Scottsdale, Arizona, nightclub. A judge sentenced him to 10 days in jail, but his sentence was reduced in exchange for Barkley's attending an alcohol-awareness course. At the news conference, Barkley sat next to Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed ""Toughest Sheriff in America."" Arpaio is known for giving inmates old-fashioned, black-and-white-striped uniforms, making some of them live in tents and reinstituting chain gangs, even for women. ""I'm an equal incarcerator,"" Arpaio said of Barkley, who will be sleeping in one of the tents. ""We don't discriminate."" He said Barkley has been ""a gentleman, cordial."" ""He's taking his medicine,"" Arpaio said. ""I hope that something comes out of this."" In a free-wheeling news conference, Barkley spoke out against drunken driving, made some observations about President Obama (""Rush Limbaugh and a lot of jackasses are giving him a hard time right now"") and commented on felony charges singer Chris Brown faces for allegedly beating his girlfriend, singer Rhianna.  Watch Barkley speak at news conference » . ""I wish both of them the best, but it's never acceptable to hit a woman. Period,"" Barkley said. Barkley wore a red-and-blue sweatsuit, not the black-and-white stripes that other inmates -- who watched the news conference through a chain-link fence --were wearing. Barkley said it's because he's on the jail's work-release program, and bristled at questions about it. ""None of the work-release people do that,"" he said. ""But if y'all really, really want to put me as low as I can go, I can do that and make you feel better. ""I know when [someone is] famous, you like to see people humiliated."" Arpaio, who joked with Barkley over the pink underwear he routinely issues inmates, held up a copy of his 1996 book, ""America's Toughest Sheriff."" On its back cover, alongside endorsements by Limbaugh, Arizona Sen. John McCain and others, is one from Barkley. ""This man, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, is a role model for all Americans,"" Barkley wrote in the blurb. Barkley is a basketball commentator for TNT, which like CNN is a Time Warner company. A star for the Philadelphia 76ers and Phoenix Suns, Barkley was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player in 1993 and inducted into its Hall of Fame in 2006.","Charles Barkley begins serving 3-day jail sentence in Maricopa County, Arizona .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President George W. Bush granted pardons Tuesday to 19 citizens charged with a variety of crimes, but none was prominent. President Bush walks down the White House Collonade on Tuesday as he departs for Camp David. Presidential pardon lists are being closely monitored in the final weeks of the Bush administration, particularly to see whether former vice presidential aide Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby will be granted the presidential favor. One of the men pardoned is Charles Winters, who died almost 25 years ago. His son had worked on winning a presidential pardon for his dad, who had helped smuggle weapons to Jews fighting in what was then Palestine in the late 1940s. A Protestant from Boston, Massachusetts, Winters spent 18 months behind bars. He was the only U.S. citizen to serve time for helping fly weapons to Jews struggling to create Israel. A 20th person received a commutation of a life sentence for possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute. That individual, Reed Raymond Prior, was ordered released from prison in February 2009. He will have served more than 12 years. ""We commend President Bush's decision to grant a commutation to Reed Prior, who is deserving of a second chance,"" Julie Stewart, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, said in a written statement. ""Of course, clemencies only underscore the larger problem -- the systemic injustice caused by mandatory minimum sentences that fill the prisons with low-level drug offenders in the first place."" Bush has granted 191 pardons and nine commutations, far fewer than Presidents Clinton and Reagan in their two-term administrations. Read the full list of pardons . Among the more notable who have applied for some form of clemency are: . • Former Rep. Randall ""Duke"" Cunningham, Republican from California, who was convicted of receiving bribes. • Publishing executive Conrad Black, who was found guilty of fraud. • Former junk bold salesman Michael Milken. • Former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers, convicted of accounting fraud. The parents of John Walker Lindh, who was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty to supporting terrorists in Afghanistan, held a news conference last week urging Bush to commute their son's sentence. It is unclear how many more requests Bush may grant before leaving office, although administration officials have said they do not expect any last-minute announcements, as was seen when President Bill Clinton pardoned fugitive financier Marc Rich, setting off a firestorm of controversy. A commutation reduces a convict's prison term, but the conviction remains on the person's record. A pardon, however, wipes the slate clean by erasing the record of the conviction. A president has the sole authority to grant clemency and to whom, although a Justice Department office usually reviews applications and makes recommendations after considering standards such as a person's degree of remorse and ability to lead a responsible and productive life after release. Those applying for a pardon through the Justice Department are required to wait at least five years after their conviction or release from confinement. Roughly 1,300 requests for commutation and 860 pardon applications are still pending. There is a long tradition of presidents issuing pardons and commutations during the holiday season.","President Bush continues a Christmas tradition by issuing pardons .

"(CNN) -- While there may be a fascination with Nadya Suleman and her brood, she is hardly the first. ""Jon & Kate Plus 8"" is one of the more popular shows featuring a large family with multiples. The mother of 14, dubbed ""Octomom"" after the birth of her octuplets in January, is the target of much speculation these days as to whether she and her multitude will become the subjects of a reality show. But programming centered on large families and those containing multiples has long been popular. With so many struggling to keep up with the homework and extracurricular activities -- as well as the financial responsibilities -- of one or two children, American viewers seem fascinated with watching parents juggle life with so many kids. ""People tell me all the time, 'But for the grace of God it could be me,' "" said Bill Hayes, founder of Figure 8 Films, the production company behind the popular shows ""Jon & Kate Plus Eight"" and ""18 and Counting,"" the latter of which features the Duggar family. ""People relate that it's a challenge to have any children, much less so many."" ""Jon & Kate Plus Eight"" has been a ratings juggernaut and follows the lives of Jon and Kate Gosselin and their eight children, including fraternal twin girls and a mixed-sex set of fraternal sextuplets (three girls and three boys).  Watch Kate Gosselin discuss the challenges of parenting » . Hayes' company brought the family's story to television, as well as that of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, who are the parents of 18 children (all conceived without the use of fertility drugs). The Duggars recently announced they're soon to be first-time grandparents. Viewers enjoy watching wholesome, family programming, especially when the subjects are as relatable as the Gosselins, Hayes said. The couple is often shown dealing with the stress that comes with having eight children under the age of 9. ""Family is very important for many people,"" he said. ""Most of us struggle with our family lives. It's not easy typically in most families. We're fortunate that Jon and Kate are very emotionally honest and they come clean."" Fame comes with a cost, however, and the couple has become tabloid fodder with stories of interfamily squabbles and marital discord. Cable networks like TLC, Discovery Health (which are both a part of Discovery Communications) and WE: Women's Entertainment have found success with programming about super-sized families. Imitation is the sincerest form of television, comedian Fred Allen once said, and TLC in particular has made the most of its large families. In addition to the Gosselins and the Duggars, the network recently debuted ""Table for 12,"" which chronicles the daily experiences of Eric and Betty Hayes and their three sets of multiples. All told, the Hayeses have 10 children, including a special-needs child. Eileen O'Neill, president and general manger for TLC, said viewers tune in to see how it all works. ""There's that innate kind of curiosity about a family on a scale of the Duggars or 'Jon & Kate,' whether it's multiples or sheer number,"" O'Neill said. (She should know: She's a twin herself.) ""Those logistics are fascinating as well as entertaining and ultimately inspiring. So many of us are part of families or run a family and I think seeing it on a super-sized level is inherently appealing."" As more women turn to fertility medication to help them conceive, the odds of multiple births increase. Maureen Doolan Boyle is executive director of MOST (Mothers of SuperTwins) a Long Island, New York-based organization that has worked with more than 20,000 families since its founding in 1987. Attitudes about multiple births vary around the world, Doolan Boyle said. In some cultures a large brood is welcomed; in others, it's viewed as a ""freak show"" or a curse. Canada's Dionne quintuplets, a group of five girls born to an Ontario farming family in 1934, became such a sideshow. When the girls were 5 months old, the provincial government declared the parents unfit and put the sisters under the care of a doctor and other guardians. The Dionnes were put on display in a nursery across the road from their family's farmhouse, becoming a huge tourist attraction. They even appeared in a handful of films before their parents regained custody in 1943. That ""freak show factor"" is one of the reasons there has been so much buzz surrounding Suleman and her family of 14 children, said Michael Levine of LCO, a Los Angeles-based public relations firm.  Watch whether Suleman is close to signing a deal » . As reality shows push boundaries to gain viewers, Levine said he understands the interest in a series on the octuplet mom and her family, but adds that he has doubts a deal can be struck because of the liability issues surrounding putting the children on television. ""What was novel three years ago is no longer novel, and I predict craziness to be the order of the day when it comes to reality television,"" he said. Still, he sees the attraction: ""Big families provide a very wonderful context for a lot of conflict and complexity that most people can relate to,"" he said. TLC's O'Neill said there are no plans at this time to have a Suleman show on her network. ""We are watching that story develop at a distance and hoping for the best for that family,"" O'Neill said.","Reality shows about large families bring big ratings for cable networks .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- In the movies, ""the suburbs"" are never just a place. They're a state of mind, a mythology we all know in our bones. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio share a happy moment in ""Revolutionary Road."" The myth goes something like this: The suburbs are comfortable, maybe even beautiful, but their serenity is rooted in a friendly American conformity, so that the people who live there have to repress their true selves, which will emerge when they drink too much and have affairs, or rage at each other for their dishonesty, which was all caused in the first place by ... the suburbs. The best thing about ""Revolutionary Road,"" a cool-blooded and disquieting adaptation of Richard Yates' 1961 novel about a powerfully unhappy Connecticut couple, is that it doesn't end with that rote vision of bourgeois anomie. It only begins there. Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) are about 30, with two kids, and both believe they can evade the traps of the existence they've chosen. The year is 1955, and Frank has a New York job that bores him, marketing business machines. He takes solace in feeling superior to his work, and also in his midday martinis and occasional dip into the secretarial pool. April, meanwhile, wanted to be an actress, and still feels she's meant for higher things.  Watch DiCaprio and Winslet talk about their reunion » . Moved to reach for something more, April comes up with a plan: She and Frank will sell their home and move to Paris, where she'll work as a government secretary and he will ... find himself. (It's like a '60s fantasy a decade ahead of time.) ""Revolutionary Road"" was directed by Sam Mendes, who made the glibly scathing ""American Beauty,"" only here he wants us to share not just Frank and April's misery but the frail reveries that hold them together. The escape-to-Paris idea is naive, impractical -- a pipe dream. Yet it's fueled by something Mendes captures about the '50s, an era when people often had deep imaginative sparks that exceeded their ability to voice them. Winslet has the tricky job of making us see the glimmer of wisdom in April's cockeyed plan, and she pulls it off, even as DiCaprio's Frank -- chipper, forthright, wholesome even in betrayal -- tugs the couple back to reality. ""Revolutionary Road"" has deception, adultery, operatic shouting, the then-forbidden specter of abortion, and a few scenes that spotlight the remarkable performance of Michael Shannon as John Givings, a mathematician who's been hospitalized for insanity, and who proves how unfit for society he is by making every acid comment cut to the truths that no one else will speak. The film is lavishly dark -- some might say too dark -- yet I'd suggest it has a different limitation: For all its shattering domestic discord, there's something remote and aestheticized about it. April brings a private well of conflict to her middle-class prison, but Winslet is so meticulous in her telegraphed despair that she intrigues us, moves us, yet never quite touches our unguarded nerves.

"(CNN) -- India is trying to reclaim the famous metal-rimmed glasses and some other artifacts from freedom leader Mahatma Gandhi that are up for auction next week in New York, a top official said Saturday. Mahatma Gandhi was known for his peaceful opposition to tyranny, which led to India's independence.

"Editor's note: Nathaniel Frank is author of ""Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America"" and is senior research fellow at the Palm Center, a think tank at the University of California, Santa Barbara, that has focused on gender, sexuality and the military. He also teaches on the adjunct faculty at New York University. Nathaniel Frank says there's no evidence that letting gays serve openly would harm the military. (CNN) --   This week, four senior retired officers wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post predicting ""grave harm"" to the military if President Obama moves forward with his vow to let gays serve openly. ""Our experience,"" they wrote, ""and that of more than 1,000 retired flag and general officers,"" suggest that lifting the ban would harm unit cohesion, recruitment and retention, and would ultimately ""break the All-Volunteer Force."" The argument is an old one, and was an effective canard in defeating President Clinton's move to lift the ban in 1993. But it has never been rooted in fact or evidence, and the effort of these officers to defeat equal treatment this time around will face mountains of opposing data and a dramatically changed cultural landscape. The officers who oppose openly gay service do not base their arguments on any new information. In addition to their own experience -- an impressive credential that's nevertheless too vague to hang an argument on -- the officers rely on a single poll. They cite an unscientific survey -- it does not draw from a representative sampling but from newspaper subscribers -- indicating that 58 percent of the military oppose lifting the ban and that, if it's lifted, 24 percent claim they will leave or consider leaving after their tour ends. But it's naïve at best, and disingenuous at worst, to confuse this opinion survey with a sound prediction of actual behavior. When both Britain and Canada proposed lifting their gay bans in the 1990s, similar opinion surveys found much higher numbers -- about two-thirds in both cases -- claiming they, too, would leave. In each case, no more than three departures were attributed to the policy change. Three. In fact, the evidence showing that openly gay service works is overwhelming. Since 1957, when the U.S. military began doing its own studies on gays in the military, every last bit of research has shown that openly gay service works. Studies of foreign militaries include a 1993 Government Accountability Office study of allied nations that found that ""the presence of homosexuals in the military is not an issue and has not created problems in the functioning of military units""; a 1994 assessment by the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences finding that predicted negative consequences of ending gay exclusion in the Canadian Forces never materialized; the 2000 assessment of the British Ministry of Defense, calling its new policy of equal treatment ""a solid achievement"" with ""no discernible impact"" on recruitment or other critical variables; and four academic studies conducted by the Palm Center, where I work, finding that lifting bans in Britain, Israel, Canada and Australia had no negative impact on military readiness, including on recruitment and retention. The officers writing in The Washington Post question the relevance of foreign militaries to this debate, mocking the idea that the U.S. military ""must emulate Denmark, the Netherlands and Canada."" But they failed to note that 24 of our closest allies let gays serve openly, including Britain, whose combat-tested soldiers and sailors serve shoulder to shoulder with U.S. forces. While our military and culture are unique in the world, it's an astonishing vote of no-confidence in American troops to say that they are not capable of doing what 24 other militaries have done successfully. Ours is a professional, disciplined fighting force, and the assertion that a diverse military would lack order and discipline is, as Rep. Patrick Murphy, an Iraq War veteran, has said, ""an insult"" to him and the entire U.S. military. But it's not just foreign militaries that provide real evidence on gay service. A majority of U.S. troops know of, or suspect, gays in their units, giving the lie to the most basic assumption underlying the gay ban: that openly gay service could never work. After all, gays are already serving, and serving openly, without causing problems. Yet despite the law's failure to keep many open gays out, the ban's persistence means that gay troops are subject to random dismissals and are often unable to access military support services for fear of being found out and fired. Even extensive research by our own military has concluded the gay ban is unnecessary, including a large 1993 study by the RAND Corporation -- a think tank created by the military itself -- and two official military studies -- a 1989 study by the Defense Personnel Security Research Center and the Navy's 1957 Crittenden report -- which all found sexual orientation is irrelevant to military performance. Indeed, neither the military nor anyone else has ever turned up a shred of evidence tying openly gay service to impairment of the military. When the officers' claims are pitted against the wealth of actual facts and research on this issue, they are shown for what they really are: fear and intolerance, rooted in a world that's largely disappeared. Indeed, the vast majority of these retired officers, including the authors of this week's op-ed, retired before the current ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy even began in 1994. Their military is not the same as today's, where three-quarters of troops are ""personally comfortable"" with gays and lesbians, and ""don't ask, don't tell"" is considered ""a joke."" These officers attribute current efforts to lift the ban to ""gay rights activists,"" when in fact, according to consistent polling, four-fifths of the American public favors repeal, including majorities of Republicans, conservatives and even churchgoers. It also includes many retired officers who did serve under, and used to support, the current policy, such as Gen. John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who sees the ban as a threat to military readiness. The officers say there is ""no compelling national security reason"" to accept the ""risks"" of lifting the ban, which they say include the likely loss of ""experienced personnel who are not easily replaced."" But under current policy, more than 800 ""mission-critical specialists"" have been fired just because they're gay, including more than 60 Arabic linguists. Due to the military's overall struggle to meet its recruiting goals, it has had to lower standards and admit convicted felons. Kicking out capable troops while replacing them with ex-convicts is not a recipe for good order and discipline. Forcing soldiers to lie to each other is not good for morale or cohesion. Drumming out Arabic linguists at a time when we don't have enough to translate what our enemies are saying is bad, not good, for national security. If these officers care more about our nation than about preserving an embalmed military culture, they'll cease and desist. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Nathaniel Frank .","Nathaniel Frank: Some retired military officers oppose letting gay troops serve .

"SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (CNN) -- The official count of confirmed deaths grew to 15 Friday afternoon, one day after a 6.1-magnitude earthquake shook north central Costa Rica, a government emergency official said. iReporter Leonardo Diaz photographed the damage in Plaza Mayor Shopping Center in San Jose. Reinaldo Carballo, a spokesman for the federal Commission for National Emergencies, said the updated death toll came from information given to the agency by Costa Rica Vice President Rodrigo Arias. In addition, Carballo said, rescuers were trying to reach 300 tourists stranded in a hotel in Varablanca. Carballo said he did not know the tourists' nationalities or the name of the hotel. There were conflicting reports on the number of dead from Thursday's earthquake. The Commission for National Emergencies had issued a news release earlier Friday saying the quake had killed four people. Also earlier Friday, Red Cross official Milton Chaverri told CNN there were 14 dead and 22 missing. Red Cross spokeswoman Fiorella Vilca said Friday afternoon there were nine dead and 42 missing. The discrepancy may result from the fact that the Commission for National Emergencies reports only deaths it has confirmed, Carballo said. About 32 people were injured, he said. On Friday, the U.S. government dispatched a team of 34 U.S. military personnel and four helicopters from Honduras-based Joint Task Force-Bravo to Costa Rica to assist. Survivors described the suddenness and brutality of the quake. Landslides, tumbling rocks and collapsed buildings caused widespread devastation and death. ""I saw how the earth moved and how it took my family -- my aunt, my cousin and her babies,"" Miguel Angel Marin told CNN affiliate Teletica TV. ""It was very hard because I wanted to save them, but I couldn't."" A sobbing Vilma Cambronero was asked what happened to her family. ""Some are well,"" she said. ""Others are buried."" An unidentified woman told Teletica, ""Everything started to move and everything fell on top of us. It was a miracle we got out."" More than 1,200 people were stranded, without a way to get out of towns or homes, Chaverri said. Another 1,000 people were living in shelters, he said. iReport.com: Are you there? Send photos, video . ""Many people were injured, many buildings were damaged and landslides blocked roads in the area,"" the U.S. Geological Survey said. The dead included three young girls, officials said Friday. Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez was scheduled to tour the affected area Friday. On Thursday, he appealed for calm. The remote area near Alajuela, where the quake hit strongest, is difficult to reach, and officials said they were having to rely on helicopters for medical evacuations and to airlift supplies. Randall Picado, a government rescue official, said many residents were without water and other necessities. About 400 volunteers and Red Cross personnel were giving aid in 15 communities, Chaverri said. The temblor was felt throughout Costa Rica and in southern and central Nicaragua, the U.S. Geological Survey reported on its Web site. ""I felt the earthquake,"" Costa Rican office worker Erick Solorzano told CNN in an iReport message. ""I work in a sixth floor, and it was very strong. We felt the building was going to collapse."" About 2,000 aftershocks have been felt in San Jose, the capital, and other cities throughout the nation, Red Cross spokeswoman Vilca said. The Geological Survey placed the earthquake's epicenter at 20 miles (32 kilometers) north-northwest of San Jose at a depth of 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers).","NEW: Rescuers trying to reach 300 tourists stranded in hotel .

"(CNN) -- Everyone aboard US Airways Flight 1549 survived when the plane crash-landed into the Hudson River, and that may be due as much to diligent rescue training as luck. Passengers and crew line up outside the plane as boats move in to rescue them. The Coast Guard rescuers who quickly got to the scene and many of the ferries and boats that first responded train for water rescues. ""We, the Coast Guard, we do train for these type of events and these type of situations, scenarios, and one thing we do try to do is try to coordinate with our other maritime agency partners [so] that incidents like this go off without a hitch or as safely as possible,"" said Coast Guard Lt. C.K. Moore, who helped coordinate the response. Within minutes of the plane crash-landing into the water, the aircraft was surrounded by ferry boats that had been making their regularly scheduled trips across the Hudson and other boats coordinated by, and including, the Coast Guard. The passengers had begun exiting the plane -- getting into rafts or standing on the wings. But as more people began to exit, the plane started to become submerged and passengers' feet started getting cold. See photos of the crash and rescue . The quick response may have helped save the lives of passengers, who if not for the rescuers may have been subjected to the frigid Hudson water. It's one of the things Moore said the Coast Guard focuses on during water rescues, especially in the winter. After only three minutes in cold water, people can lose the use of their arms and legs, according to the Oregon State Marine Board. At the time of the crash it was 21 degrees outside, the water temperature in the Hudson was 32.5 degrees and winds were blowing at 15 mph. Oregon State Marine Board: Surviving cold water immersion .

""And when something comes, you already know how to take effect and how to put everything together, so it just went very smoothly."" Catanzaro immediately told her crew to get life jackets on, take extras to throw in the water, and prepare a cradle to help bring passengers onto the boat. The boat was the second on the scene. ""When I got there, my crew went to work and started pulling out people,""  she said. ""Some people were sighing with relief, some people were crying. It was nerve-wracking."" In all, Catanzaro's crew helped bring 24 people aboard. ""I was telling my crew, even if we pulled out one person, that was one more person we saved,"" she said. ""And to pull out 24 people, that's 24 people."" The Coast Guard was able to pluck at least 35 people from the water and wing of the plane. Catanzaro's crew and the Coast Guard were able to take nearly half the plane's passengers out of the Hudson. That's a credit to their training, Moore said, which is done exactly for this scenario. ""We do train with each other from time to time to understand what each other can bring to the table when it comes to -- to search and rescue,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A man suspected in the slayings of his girlfriend and her four children admitted choking the Oklahoma woman to death, but said the children were not present at the time, according to an affidavit filed in the case. Joshua Steven Durcho was arrested Tuesday after a car chase with police. Joshua Steven Durcho, 25, was arrested Tuesday night in Hamilton County, Texas, officials said. He is suspected of killing Summer Rust, 25; her son Teagin, 4; and daughters Evynn, 3, and Autumn and Kirsten, both 7. All five bodies were found in Rust's apartment in El Reno, Oklahoma, about 30 miles west of Oklahoma City, on Monday. Durcho's first cousin notified authorities he found the body of Rust, who is identified in the affidavit as Summer Dawn Garas. Police also found the children's bodies in the apartment, according to the affidavit, written by a special agent with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation and filed Tuesday in Canadian County, Oklahoma, District Court. ""The Medical Examiner's Office has reported to our agents that the preliminary assessment of the cause and manner of death for all five individuals was asphyxiation, suffocation and strangulation,"" the affidavit said. ""It was also reported that each body had ligature marks around the neck. The ligature marks were also observed by OSBI crime scene investigators."" A spokeswoman for the state medical examiner's office told CNN on Wednesday that the cause of death for Summer Rust and Teagin was strangulation, and that a ligature -- which could include a string, cord or wire -- was used to strangle them. Autopsies on the three girls were being conducted Wednesday, the spokeswoman said. A woman told police Durcho came to her apartment Monday afternoon and told her he had ""choked"" Summer Rust to death and that he was leaving Oklahoma, according to the affidavit. The woman asked Durcho about Rust's children, the affidavit said, and ""Durcho told her that the children were at their grandmother's residence ... while he and Summer worked out their relationship problems."" The woman called Durcho's mother and told her what he had said about killing Rust, the affidavit said. Durcho's mother drove to the apartment to check on the woman, but no one answered her knocks. She then called her nephew, Durcho's cousin, to accompany her, leading to the discovery of Rust's body, according to the document. About 6:30 p.m. Monday, the affidavit said, Durcho went to the home of another cousin, a female, and told her ""he was in trouble and that he was headed out of state."" Durcho was driving Rust's 1989 white Ford Thunderbird, the document said, and asked his cousin to swap cars with him, but she declined. A surveillance video showed Durcho at a truck stop on Interstate 40 about three hours later, driving the Thunderbird, the affidavit said. Early Tuesday morning, a text message was sent from a cell phone in Durcho's possession to his mother's cell phone, according to the affidavit. Tracking and cell phone records showed Durcho's phone was located in Wichita Falls, Texas, at the time. Later that morning, Durcho called his mother, with the call shown to be from the Abilene, Texas, area, the affidavit said. Durcho's mother said ""Durcho told her he loved her and had to go,"" according to the document. Police said Durcho was arrested after a car chase Tuesday night. A Texas state trooper attempted to stop the car Durcho was driving because the trooper suspected the driver was drunk, according to Erin Mangrum of the Canadian County sheriff's office. When the trooper ran the license plate on the car, it matched the tag number of a vehicle sought by Oklahoma police. The car sped off, Mangrum said, and during the ensuing chase the car crashed. Durcho suffered only minor injuries and was taken into custody, Mangrum said. A court hearing was to be held for Durcho on Wednesday in Hamilton County, according to CNN affiliates. The Hamilton County district attorney's office did not immediately return a call from CNN. Durcho was being held in the county jail Tuesday night, Mangrum said. Rust's mother, Susan Rust of Carson City, Nevada, said Durcho was unemployed and had been living with Rust and her children.","NEW: Affidavit describes suspect's actions after slayings .

"Editor's note: Republican Leslie Sanchez was director of the White House Initiative on Hispanic Education from 2001 to 2003 and author of ""Los Republicanos: Why Hispanics and Republicans Need Each Other."" She is CEO of the Impacto Group, which specializes in market research about women and Hispanics. Leslie Sanchez says Republicans should treat Hispanics as part of the mainstream of America. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As the members of the Republican National Committee prepare to choose a party chairman to serve for the next two years, the calls for new ""Hispanic outreach"" initiatives are flying -- in my view, unnecessarily. It is probably true that President Obama's election marks the beginning of a post-partisan, post-racial America, or at least a time when these issues are less divisive than in years past. But will the two political parties be as able to look beyond the stereotypes of Latinos and what the Latino experience is in this country, as they have for other ethnic and racial groups? As Republicans, we need to win at least 35 percent of the Hispanic vote to win the presidency. In 2008, John McCain got 31 percent, slightly exceeding the average for the past eight presidential elections. We've had our high points (George W. Bush 2004, 44 percent) and low points (Bob Dole 1996, 21 percent). Ten years ago, as an RNC press aide, I was given the responsibility for developing a team that would design a multimillion-dollar ad strategy to appeal to the nation's emerging Latino electorate. We conducted seminal research on Hispanic voting patterns that is still of value today. For example, we identified a ""GOP Upside"" of another 25 percent of Hispanics who were voting Democrat on the generic presidential ballot question but would be interested in voting for a Republican who offered a campaign agenda focused on family, education and job-creation issues. So it is mystifying to me to hear the ongoing references to the party's need to find ""a new way"" to speak to the nation's largest minority bloc. It's like being asked to reinvent the wheel. This isn't just a Republican problem. Democrats do this too, relating to Latinos as if we're primarily poor, immigrant or both. It doesn't work anymore, if it ever did. And although the anti-immigrant rhetoric spouted by Tom Tancredo and others was offensive to Hispanics and projected a ""We don't want you here"" image for the GOP, the fact is that it was offensive to a lot of other people, too. In the age of Obama, that kind of exclusive message is just not marketable. If Republicans truly want to develop a winning strategy for appealing to Hispanics, they need look no further than Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. They appealed to them not as Hispanics or immigrants but as Americans with an equal stake in the future of the country. What Hispanics want, and what we as Republicans want them to want, is to be included in the American experience. During the period in which Hispanics constituted a small minority of the overall nation, efforts like Richard Nixon's to ensure that they were counted in the national census were important because it meant inclusion. When people believe that they are already part of a community, such patently obvious efforts come across as patronizing. Hispanics, especially young professionals like me who were born and raised here in the United States, believe that we deserve more than a couple of high-profile meetings and a few Spanish-language ads. That was certainly true during the 2008 presidential campaign, which had little to interest Hispanics at all. McCain trumpeted his record as a champion of comprehensive immigration reform to Hispanics, while his campaign tried to make him more palatable to Republican conservatives by de-emphasizing his record as a champion of comprehensive immigration reform. McCain was hurt among Latinos by the perception that he caved in on immigration enforcement and abandoned his own bill. Obama's campaign message to Hispanics, though delivered largely in Spanish through his campaign Web site, was patronizing. In the summary of issues for his Latino Blueprint for Change, Obama talked about a narrow group of issues that, in my view, are important to only a small percentage of Latinos. For example, on education, his message focused largely on English as a second language and in-state tuition for undocumented students. On immigration, he tried to counter the Republicans. On jobs and the economy, he highlighted the minimum wage. These issues, which may have been important to a majority of Hispanics when Cesar Chavez was leading striking farm workers, are not at the top of the list for Hispanics today. To remain largely focused on them is to patronize millions of upwardly mobile Hispanics who are not immigrants and who don't think of themselves as hyphenated Americans. Which is probably why Obama's echoing of Chavez's ""Sí, Se Puede!"" during his concession speech after the Texas primary was met with silence and blank stares. Hispanic political sophistication is increasing alongside Hispanic economic progress. A new HispanTelligence Research report suggests that the number of Hispanic-owned businesses in the United States will increase to 4.3 million over the next six years. We need to appreciate that it is not the message as much as it is the audience. Speaking past Hispanics or down to Hispanics is not the way to invite them into a long-term relationship. We no longer see ourselves as hyphens or as members of the Hispanic community only; we see ourselves as Americans, with a broad array of interests. Before the development of the virtual world, communities were defined by geography, ethnicity, religion, income, race and other elements that were as apparent to those inside a community as outside it. Now, through social networking tools like Facebook and Twitter, which the Obama campaign exploited to new degrees of success, people are developing their own communities of common interest. Hispanics want to see the political parties realize that they do, in fact, belong to the larger community called ""America"" as well as myriad interest groups. We may choose to define ourselves as part of certain ""ethnic"" or ""interest"" groups. It's not the job of a political party to define us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leslie Sanchez.","Leslie Sanchez: Republicans are talking about a new outreach to Hispanics .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Jon Hamm has a confession to make: He hates his hair. Jon Hamm poses with his partner, Jennifer Westfeldt, at the premiere of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" That may come as a surprise to fans of the actor, whose slick-backed hair is part of his signature look on ""Mad Men"" -- the show that just earned him another Golden Globe nomination for best actor in a TV drama. In the new movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" Hamm sports a slightly different 'do, with his bangs combed rakishly over one eye. It was in the context of promoting the sci-fi remake that Hamm revealed his tonsorial frustration. ""It's the bane of my existence. Goofy hair,"" he said in a self-deprecating interview with CNN. ""It never looks good ... It's a pain."" Hamm says he's always worn his hair long, but had to cut it for AMC's TV series, in which he plays a 1960s Madison Avenue ad executive. He says stylists on the show, armed with hair spray and blow dryers, mold his coiffure into a hard shell. Helmet hair has come in handy at work. ""I've had a piece of the set fall on my head and my hair didn't move,"" he said. ""I had seven stitches in my head and my hair didn't move. That's impressive."" Whether it's his hair, good looks, acting chops or a combination thereof, Hamm's star is on the rise in Hollywood. Apart from his co-starring role in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" Hamm recently completed work on the murder mystery ""The Boy in the Box."" He hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" this fall, he's due to play Tina Fey's love interest on ""30 Rock"" and he continues to receive accolades for his work on ""Mad Men"" (nominations for an Emmy and a Golden Globe so far). How does that make Hamm feel? ""Exciting is the right way to say it. It's been a good year. It's very exciting,"" he said. ""I get to read a lot more scripts. I get to meet interesting people. I get to work with interesting people ... It's fun to be sort of invited to the party.""","""Mad Men"" star Jon Hamm earned another Golden Globe nomination .

"(CNN) -- Ricky Gervais says he's not sure if the lead in ""Ghost Town"" -- an anti-social, cynical dentist named Bertram Pincus -- was written for him. Ricky Gervais has established a career playing characters with an abrasive edge. And he's not sure if he wants to know. ""I'm scared to ask,"" he says in a phone interview from Los Angeles, California. ""[Writer-director David Koepp] says that when they first had the idea, that it should be played by me, [and] they never looked back. Now I don't know whether that was as they were coming up with it, or whether it was because they found out no one else was available. Steve Carell had said no, Will Ferrell had said no, Jack Black had said no, Ben Stiller had said no ... everyone had said no, and they went, 'Oh, is there no one ... I wonder if HE'S available.' ""I don't know which is closer. I'd like to think the first one's closer."" But, he adds, he was more than happy to take the role. ""When I read it, I thought, 'This is me,' "" he says. ""It was my voice; it's something I could have written. Even the lines sounded like that grumpy misanthrope I often play. And then they made it even more me.""  Watch a clip from ""Ghost Town"" with Mr. Moviefone » . Indeed, Gervais, 47, has risen to fame playing characters who are, let us say, less than friendly. On the original UK version of ""The Office,"" which he created with longtime writing partner Stephen Merchant, he played David Brent, the socially tone-deaf general manager of a paper company branch office who continually shocked co-workers with his immature jokes and patronizing attitude. He followed that as Andy Millman in ""Extras,"" a borderline performer always angling for the main chance. And in ""Ghost Town,"" which came out on DVD Sunday, Gervais' Dr. Pincus can't stand to communicate with the ghosts he starts meeting after a near-death experience. He does have a bit of redemption.  He strikes up a romance with Gwen (Tea Leoni), an antiquities expert, and ends up helping out a few of his late comrades. But in Gervais' portrayal, Pincus retains his abrasive edge. The movie earned generally good reviews and a decent box office upon its late-summer release, with the Boston Globe's Ty Burr comparing Gervais to a Hollywood legend. ""Someone once said about W.C. Fields that he had the rare ability to despise amusingly. I can imagine no greater compliment than to say that Ricky Gervais seems, at his best, like a young Fields,"" Burr wrote. That kind of misanthrope is the furthest thing from the Gervais of the phone interview, an engaging man who answers questions with patience and thoughtfulness. Asked why British actors play socially unpleasant roles so well, he ponders the question, makes asides to how often British actors play villains and ""bumbling fops"" and soon offers a disquisition on the differences between British and American culture.  Watch more insight on interviewing Ricky Gervais » . ""I think we play the loser well because England's full of them,"" he says. ""We celebrate our losers, we celebrate our underdogs, we celebrate those people -- [and then] we build them up and then we don't like them anymore. Whereas Americans celebrate success. Americans are brought up to believe they can be the next president of the United States. British people are told it won't happen to you. It sounds like a generalization, but it's true."" He adds that he just finished writing a film with Merchant called ""The Man from the Pru,"" set in early-'70s England. ""It's about class, and it's about can you escape being born living, growing up and dying in the same street,"" he says. ""I know that's the same the world over ... but it's because Britain is so small and so diverse. ""You really couldn't get out of your class before celebrity came along. The American class system always seemed a bit fairer to me, because it was built on achievement as opposed to blood."" Since Gervais likes to write his own material, he's careful about the roles he takes, even with Hollywood beckoning. ""Ghost Town"" was a good fit, he says, because he and Koepp hit it off so well. ""The whole thing was really collaborative,"" he says. ""I'm not usually an actor for hire, but this was great."" Indeed, it's the collaboration that made it, he says. He welcomes that kind of bouncing ideas back and forth, and says he'd love to do something with Steve Carell, who plays the American version of Brent, Michael Scott, on the U.S. version of ""Office."" The two had a memorably hilarious exchange at this year's often unfunny Emmy show. ""I would love to host anything with Steve Carell,"" he says. ""I would do a cat show with Steve Carell. I would do Computer Nerds' Mr. Universe with Steve Carell. So if anyone asks me if I will host a show with Steve Carell, the answer's yes."" Perhaps that could happen soon: Gervais' name is often bandied about in rumors about awards show hosting duties. However, he adds, he remains in the dark about it all. ""I'm on a list,"" he says. ""But I don't know what that means.""","Ricky Gervais plays misanthropic dentist in ""Ghost Town,"" now out on DVD .

"(CNN) -- Just days before he was sworn in, President Obama was giving his daughters a tour of the Lincoln Memorial when one of them pointed to a copy of Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address carved into the wall. President Obama strides into history as the nation's first black president. Obama's 7-year-old daughter, Sasha, told her father that Lincoln's speech was really long. Would he have to give a speech as long? Obama's answer was completed by his older daughter, 10-year-old Malia. ""I said, 'Actually, that one is pretty short. Mine may even be a little longer,' "" Obama told CNN recently. ""At which point, Malia turns to me and says, 'First African-American president, better be good.' "" The story is light-hearted, but it touches on a delicate question: Will people hold Obama to a different standard because he is the first African-American president? Americans appear split by race on that answer. According to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, 53 percent of blacks say the American public will hold Obama to a higher standard than past presidents because he is black. Most whites -- 61 percent -- say Obama's race will not matter in how he will be judged. The question divided several people who were racial pioneers themselves. Alexander Jefferson was one of the first blacks allowed to become a fighter pilot. He was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of black pilots who escorted bombers in World War II. ""We had to be twice as good to be average,"" he says. Obama won't face the same pressures he did because his presidential predecessor was so inept, Jefferson says. ""No, the world is ready for him,"" he says. ""The [George W.] Bush debacle was so depressing."" Jefferson was shot down by ground fire on his 19th mission and spent a year in German prison camps. He wrote about his POW experiences in ""Red Tail Captured, Red Tail Free: Memoirs of a Tuskegee Airman and POW."" Jefferson says he dealt with the pressures of being a racial pioneer by drawing on the strength of black leaders who opened doors for him. ""I sit on the backs of everyone who came before me,"" says Jefferson, who attended Obama's inauguration with other Tuskegee Airmen. Jefferson says he would have emotionally imploded if he'd thought too much about the pressures of representing all blacks and dealing with the racism he encountered when he returned home to a segregated America after the war. ""I did what I had to do so I didn't go stark-raving mad,"" he says. ""There wasn't all this self-analysis and back and forth. I was too damn busy with a wife, a child and a mortgage."" Michele Andrea Bowen couldn't avoid a bout of constant self-analysis. She was one of the first African-American students admitted to a doctorate program in history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""I know Obama is going to be held to a different standard,"" says Bowen, author of ""Up at the College"" and books such as ""Holy Ghost Corner,"" which celebrate black faith and culture. Bowen says she faced relentless scrutiny, and so will Obama. ""You know that it was hard for you to get in it, and you know they're watching you,"" Bowen says. ""And you know that they're judging you by a critical standard that's sometimes not fair."" Bowen says a white classmate, her partner in dissertation, once confided to her that he received the same grades as she did, even though he knew his work was inferior. ""It toughened me up,"" Bowen says. ""It can give you headaches and stomachaches. I learned you have to be thankful that God blessed you with that opportunity. At some point, you stop worrying, and you trust God."" 'Would Bush have been president if he were black?' Perhaps Obama will avoid those stomachaches because of the massive good will his election has generated. But that could change quickly if Obama makes a controversial decision or a mistake, says Andrew Rojecki, co-author of ""The Black Image in the White Mind: Media and Race in America."" Rojecki says people who say Obama isn't going to be held to a different standard because of his skin color didn't pay attention to his campaign. He says Obama had to deal with challenges that other candidates didn't have to face. Obama's run for office was almost ended by his association with his minister, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, whose incendiary sermons shocked many. But Republican presidential nominee John McCain's relationship with the Rev. John Hagee, who was accused of anti-Semitism, never threatened to end his campaign, Rojecki says. ""Obama was held responsible for what his minister said, and McCain was associated with Hagee, but somehow that didn't stick,"" says Rojecki, a communication professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Even people who regard themselves as the most progressive, open-minded supporters may subconsciously hold Obama to a different standard, Rojecki says. He says several academic studies show that it often takes people longer to associate good qualities to blacks when different faces are flashed across a screen. ""They have these stereotypes buried in their subconscious,"" he says. ""That's why people cross the street when they see a young black man. They'd rather not take a chance."" Obama virtually had to be perfect to overcome those stereotypes, Rojecki says. He was the first black editor of the Harvard Law Review, he has an Ivy League-educated wife and adorable daughters, and he ran a great campaign. ""He's the perfect symbol of achievement,"" Rojecki says. White candidates for office don't have to have an uninterrupted life of achievement to be considered for the Oval Office, Rojecki says. ""If George W. Bush were black, do you think he would be president?"" Rojecki says. Jefferson, the Tuskegee Airman, says Obama should have at least one consolation. The problems he confronts now are so immense that anyone, even someone who was considered by many to be perfect, would not be able to escape withering judgment. ""If the president was Jesus Christ, '' Jefferson says, ""they would still debate if he's qualified.""","Racial pioneers say they felt pressure to be extraordinary .

"DECATUR, Georgia (CNN) -- One falling tree saved John Kiefer from another. Windstorms in Atlanta, Georgia, uprooted several trees, including this one that fell through John Kiefer's home. Kiefer was sitting on his sofa Monday morning while a brief but intense windstorm blew through the Atlanta, Georgia, area, including Decatur. He heard a tree crash in his backyard and got up to investigate. That tree knocked down a chain-link fence, and Kiefer was getting worried about several other large backyard trees that were swaying in the wind. ""And as I'm watching those move and sway, this crashed down,"" he said. ""This"" was a 50-foot red oak in the front yard that fell onto his living room, splitting his house in half and coming to rest a few inches above where he had been sitting on the couch. ""Yeah, it's a mess,"" he said as he surveyed the tangle of broken wood beams, plaster, bricks and gray insulation. Curiously, Kiefer's electricity was still on, and cable TV was still playing less then 10 feet away from the massive tree trunk in his living room. An ancient upright piano and various collectibles on it were unharmed. Kiefer had been away over the weekend, visiting a son in Cincinnati, Ohio, and his three dogs were still at the kennel where he boarded them. They'll be staying there a bit longer. Three years of drought in Georgia have weakened trees' root systems, and recent heavy rains loosened the soil around them, said Kiefer, who works at a plastics recycling company in nearby Stone Mountain. The windstorm brought down hundreds of trees in the area, including one that crushed a car, killing the person inside, and one that fell on a nursing home, where no one was hurt, CNN affiliate WGCL reported. Service was disrupted on Atlanta's MARTA rail transit system, according to WGCL. Power and traffic signals were out in many areas.  Watch CNN report about dangerous storms » . Despite having a tree lying across his living room, Kiefer seemed remarkably calm, but that was a new development. ""Couple of hours ago my knees where shaking pretty good,"" he admitted. But, he said, God was looking out for him. ""Actually, he saved my life,"" Kiefer said. ""When I came outside to investigate that noise, that was my warning to get up off that couch.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Porn icon Marilyn Chambers was found dead in her Los Angeles home Sunday night, but investigators do not suspect foul play, according to a Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman. Marilyn Chambers rose to fame as an adult-film actress in the 1970s. Chambers began her career in 1970 as a model for Ivory Snow soap, and starred two years later in the porn classic ""Behind the Green Door."" ""She was a really nice girl,"" said actor Ron Jeremy, who co-starred with Chambers in adult films starting in the 1970s. Chambers' death was a ""total shock,"" Jeremy said, because they had been scheduled to sign a contract Monday to perform together in an off-Broadway ""tongue-in-cheek"" re-enactment of the porn classic ""Deep Throat."" ""What's strange is that she was at a stage where she was totally happy and totally content with her life,"" Jeremy said. ""Her life was falling together, and she was doing really well."" A family member found Chambers, 56, in the mobile home where she lived in the Canyon Country area and called police Sunday evening, sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitemore said. The death appeared to be from natural causes, although toxicology tests have not been completed, Whitemore said. The coroner's investigation has not been completed, and no cause of death has been determined, according to a spokesman with the Los Angeles Medical Examiner's office. Although her career was mostly in X-rated films, Chambers' fame was boosted by the irony that her face had graced the Ivory Snow box, a soap advertised as ""99 and 44/100 percent pure."" Chambers eventually co-starred with all of the best-known porn actors of the 1970s and 1980s, Jeremy said.","NEW: She had been set to sign contract for off-Broadway show with Ron Jeremy .

The former reserve player for Punahou High School's 1979 state championship team brings an enthusiasm for pickup basketball games to a place where golf, baseball and football have been the most-discussed sports. Reggie Miller says he'd pick Barack Obama for his squad because he likes the president-elect's team approach. And if he puts hoops in the White House, Reggie Miller, the retired basketball star and sports broadcaster, wants in. ""I would love to be the first to go there and play,"" said Miller, whose record-breaking 2,560 three-pointers with the Indiana Pacers electrified basketball fans. Today Miller, 43, is an NBA analyst for TNT, which is owned by Turner Broadcasting, parent company of CNN. Miller and others have said Obama's playing style yields clues to the type of president he will be. Miller, who said he backed Obama in the election, spoke Monday to CNN.com. iReport.com: What would you like to ask Obama? CNN: Do you know Barack Obama? Reggie Miller: I have never met him personally, but from afar, obviously I admire the man and the courage and the strength, the wisdom. I respect how much of a family man he is. CNN: Where does basketball fit in your view of Barack Obama? Miller: It seems like he has a regular pickup game, which I like because as a ballplayer, you like to do the same routine. ... He plays with the same guys, he likes to get a good sweat in. ... When you get a good workout in, you feel good for the rest of the day. It helps clear the mind. CNN: He's a left-hander; he likes to fake right and go to the left? Miller: I've seen clips of his Punahou [high school] days, when he played in Hawaii, and I saw that HBO special with Bryant Gumbel when they had that informal game. ... He is a point guard, and most point guards are right-handed, so it would be definitely be difficult to guard a point guard that was left-handed. And in that [HBO] clip, I loved his decision-making, because it looked like he tried to get everyone involved, until it was game point and it was tied up. Obviously, the commander in chief decides the game [Obama made the winning shot], and I like it. I think that trickles down into, you let your colonels, your generals do all the little work, but when it's time to make the big decision and win the game -- then it's the commander in chief, top dog, numero uno. But I will say this, if I was playing against him in a pickup game, I would definitely force him right because it looks like he loves to go left. CNN: Does he remind you of anyone you played against? Miller: Well, it's funny because you don't play against a lot of left-handed point guards. Greg Anthony of the Knicks, a left-handed point guard from UNLV. ... [Nate] ""Tiny"" Archibald, I believe he was left-handed as well. CNN: From what you've seen, how good a player is Obama? Miller: I would not mind picking him up on my squad; if there were 10 guys and we had to pick, he could definitely be in my squad. Because he knows what his strength is -- making sure that everyone gets involved, and that's the kind of point guard I want. Those are guys like Magic Johnson, Mark Jackson, John Stockton, it's not all about them; it's about let's make sure our team is good. He's going to get the ball to everyone. CNN: Speaking of being commander in chief, what are the lessons that you take away from Obama's basketball that you think would be useful? Miller: If you look at his demeanor, he's very cool; you have to be cool under pressure. You can't make hasty decisions. You've got to look at the full picture as a whole and then you assess it. And I think from a strategic and a political standpoint, I think that very much sums up Mr. Obama. You look at him during the debate and during the campaign, he pretty much never got too high and never got too low; he just kind of stayed right in the middle. When you're making the decisions that he's going to be making, for our economy, for Iraq, Afghanistan, you want someone who's levelheaded who's going to look at the big picture, who's going to rely on his Cabinet, which would be the other players. You want them to all be on same page, which you want your starting five to be, and then you go out there and execute it. CNN: You think he's going to have an impact on the sport of basketball by example? Miller: It's not just basketball, I think sports in general. You know he's already said yes, ""I think we should have a BCS"" [playoff system for deciding the nation's college football championship], and I think everyone agrees with him. I think his love of basketball is only going to help the high school, collegiate and professional ranks. ... For sports in general, it's good to have a person in the White House who's physically fit, who loves sports but also understands and knows how to run a country. CNN: In that order? Miller: I don't know about that order. I think I would probably start with running the country first. I think what we do is more entertainment and letting people escape. I think running the country is a little more important than worrying about the BCS title game. I think getting jobs is probably first and foremost and getting our economy straight and getting our troops home, I think those are the most important things for the president-elect. But if he does find time to get a BCS playoff, that would be nice.","Reggie Miller: Barack Obama's basketball style offers clues to his leadership .

"(CNN)  -- The Liberty Sun, a U.S.-flagged cargo ship bound for Mombasa, Kenya, was attacked Tuesday by Somali pirates, according to a NATO source with direct knowledge of the matter. Pirates attacked The Liberty Sun, a U.S.-flagged  cargo ship, but were unable to board. ""The pirates fired rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons at the vessel, which sustained damage,"" said a statement from New York-based Liberty Maritime Corporation, which owns the vessel. The ship was carrying U.S. food aid for African nations, the statement said. The pirates never made it onto the ship and the vessel is now being escorted by a coalition ship, still bound for Mombasa, officials said. Two senior defense officials said the Liberty Sun was being escorted by the guided missile destroyer USS Bainbridge. It is the ship carrying Richard Phillips, the captain of the container ship Maersk Alabama, which was hijacked last week. Phillips spent days as a hostage of the pirates before being rescued Sunday. Katy Urbik of Wheaton, Illinois, said her son, Thomas, was aboard the Liberty Sun at the time of the attack. She shared the e-mails he sent as the ship came under fire. ""We are under attack by pirates, we are being hit by rockets. Also bullets,"" said one e-mail sent Tuesday afternoon. ""We are barricaded in the engine room and so far no one is hurt. [A] rocket penetrated the bulkhead but the hole is small. Small fire, too, but put out. ""Navy is on the way and helos and ships are coming. I'll try to send you another message soon. [G]ot to go now. I love you mom and dad and all my brothers and family."" ""My heart stopped after I realized there wasn't going to be a 'just kidding' after his comment,"" Katy Urbik said. About 1½ hours later, Thomas Urbik sent another e-mail to his mother, which said, ""The navy has showed up in full force and we are now under military escort ... all is well. I love you all and thank you for the prayers."" In an e-mail only hours before the attack, Urbik's son tried to assure his mother that his crew was safe and taking precautions. ""Don't worry too much. I am fine and we are being well monitored by the U.S. Navy, who is demanding we send them a report every six hours on our position and status,"" Thomas Ubrik's e-mail said. He added, ""We in fact are going to be the second American ship to arrive into Mombasa after the Maersk Alabama. It should be interesting to say the least. ... We have had several drills to prepare ourselves to secure ourselves in the engine room. [W]e can do it pretty quick by now."" The company said the ship had dropped off food aid last week at a Sudanese port and the ship was going around the Horn of Africa to reach Kenya when it came under attack. However, the exact location of the attack remained unclear. Earlier Tuesday, pirates off the coast of Somalia seized two freighters, proving they remain a force to contend with just days after the U.S. Navy dramatically rescued an American captain held by other pirates. First, pirates in the Gulf of Aden on Tuesday hijacked the MV Irene EM, a 35,000-ton Greek-owned bulk carrier, according to a NATO spokesman and the European Union's Maritime Security Center. The crew of the Greek carrier was thought to be unhurt and ships have been warned to stay clear of the area for fear of further attack, the Security Center said. Later Tuesday, pirates on four skiffs seized the 5,000-ton MV Sea Horse, a Lebanese-owned and Togo-flagged vessel, said Cmdr. Chris Davies of NATO's Maritime Component Command Headquarters in Northwood, England. Details about the ship and its crew weren't immediately available. NATO has an ongoing anti-piracy mission off Somalia called Operation Allied Protector. The mission involves four ships covering more than a million square miles, Davies said. A U.S.-led international naval task force, Combined Task Force-151, is also patrolling in the region. Tuesday's hijackings came two days after sharpshooters from the U.S. Navy SEALs killed three pirates who had been holding Phillips hostage on the water for days. Phillips had offered himself as a hostage when pirates attacked the Alabama on Wednesday, officials said. The ship had been on its way to deliver aid to Mombasa, Kenya. A fourth pirate had been aboard Bainbridge when the shootings occurred and was taken into custody.  Watch the tough tactics the Navy uses » . The incident follows four freighters being seized over the past two days by pirates off the Somalian coast, proving they remain a force to contend with. Pirates on Monday hijacked two Egyptian fishing boats carrying a total of between 18 and 24 people, the Egyptian Information Ministry told CNN. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry is working to end the hijacking, the ministry said. Egyptian boats are known to use Somali waters illegally for fishing, taking advantage of the lawless state of the country and the lack of enforcement of its maritime boundaries. Those who have tracked pirate activity in Somalia say it started in the 1980s, when the pirates claimed they were trying to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast. Piracy accelerated after the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms. Those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions. Some experts say companies are simply making the problem worse by paying the pirates. CNN's Mike Mount, Barbara Starr and David McKenzie contributed to this report.","Crewman e-mailed hours before attack that Navy was monitoring the ship .

"(CNN) -- Seydou Keita wrecked any chance of a Bayern Munich comeback in their Champions League quarterfinal return with a second half equaliser as Barcelona drew 1-1 for an emphatic 5-1 aggregate win. Bayern scorer Franck Ribery embraces Barcelona's Lionel Messi after Bayern's European exit. Primera Liga leaders Barcelona arrived in Germany with a comfortable first leg cushion and will now host Chelsea in their semifinal first leg at the Nou Camp on April 28. No side in the tournament's history had overturned a four goal deficit and Bayern were always up against it. ""We were much better in the personal duels, things were a bit more normal, and we played the way you need to against such a good team,"" said Germany defender Philipp Lahm. ""But unfortunately we have still lost the tie."" And Bayern Munich president Franz Beckenbauer -- who was scathing after the first-leg debacle -- said the Germans had gone some way to redemption. ""I think the team has rehabilitated itself, although Barcelona's equalising goal was needlessly conceded"", said Beckenbauer. After going close in the first-half, Franck Ribery finally unpicked the Barcelona defense on 47 minutes before Keita equalised for the Spanish with less than 20 minutes left. No Spanish side has ever won the treble of league, Kings Cup and Champions League, but Barcelona are on course to take all three titles as coach Josep Guardiola hopes to lead the Spaniards to a third European title after 1992 and 2006. France striker Thierry Henry succumbed to a high temperature for Barca, while Bayern's Germany strikers Lukas Podolski and Miroslav Klose were ruled out with calf and ankle injuries respectively. That left Italian World Cup winner Luca Toni as the lone forward with Ribery playing just behind him. Bayern coach Jurgen Klinsmann was booed by his own fans before kick-off, but this result on the back of the weekend's 4-0 win over Frankfurt in the German league will have taken some of the pressure off the ex-Germany coach.","Seydou Keita wrecks Bayern Munich comeback bid as Barcelona progress .

"Editor's note: Tom Wilkerson is chief executive officer of the United States Naval Institute, a nonprofit professional association which describes itself as an independent forum for examining issues related to the Navy, Marines and Coast Guard. He spent 31 years in the military, rising to major general of Marines and, in his last assignment, serving as commander, Marine Forces Reserve. Retired Major General Tom Wilkerson says the U.S. should attack the pirates at their bases. (CNN) -- It is well past time to take a serious look at piracy off the coast of Africa. Initially, the U.S. ignored the threat, and when public outcry about our seeming indifference became louder, we formed a combined task force of international navies in the Gulf of Aden under command of a U.S. Navy rear admiral to ""deter, disrupt and thwart"" the pirates. Today, it is clear that initiative has failed. In fact, this bit of muscle-flexing did so little to intimidate pirates operating out of Somalia that they have actually increased the number of attacks in the last month. Significant among those attacks, pirates on Wednesday boarded and temporarily held a U.S.-flagged vessel, the container ship Maersk Alabama. The U.S. crew and its captain retook the vessel, but at the price of the captain becoming a hostage to the four pirates in one of the Maersk Alabama's lifeboats. Several hours later a U.S. warship, the Aegis destroyer USS Bainbridge, arrived on scene and, as I write, the standoff with the pirates continues. What an embarrassing and frustrating event! A bunch of maritime thugs brazenly seized a vessel flying the flag of the nation with the most powerful navy the world has ever known. The fault does not lie with the ships and sailors of Combined Task Force-151. They have been given the proverbial mission impossible -- stop pirate attacks in an area four times the size of Texas with only three U.S. Navy ships and a total of 12 to 15 allied/friendly warships. Not gonna happen! But embarrassment aside, there is real potential for loss of life and for continued attacks on vessels plying these waters. The issue is simple but difficult -- how do we eliminate the pirate threat? Strangely, we seem unable to learn from our own history. In 1804 President Thomas Jefferson said ""Enough"" to paying 20 percent of the U.S. national budget as tribute to Barbary pirates. His response was clear and successful -- build a strong naval task force, equip it with a sizeable contingent of Marines, and send it to attack and defeat the pirates in their lair. The sailors and Marines sent on that mission did just that -- and in the process wrote a stirring page in our nation's early history. The problem today is that we have refused to take the Jefferson model. We've confined our anti-piracy efforts to the open seas and left the pirates' home bases on land as a sanctuary. Thus, the pirates continue to operate with relative freedom and stealth. We and our allies only respond, never seizing the initiative. The Jefferson model is a better answer: Take on the pirates where they are, rather than guessing where they will be. In short, attack them at their home bases. There they are vulnerable. There is where they plan and prepare for raids on vessels. There is where they arrange ransom for held ships and crew members. From these bases, pirates are free to conduct raids without fear of reprisal, let alone interference from organized justice. They are free to venture out to prey upon one of the 33,000 ships that pass near their coast each year, knowing that they can return to the absolute security of their land bases and enjoy their spoils. It is time to change strategy and take the fight to the pirates, as our military predecessors did with great success more than 200 years ago. In the 21st century, anti-piracy measures should ideally be the responsibility of local and regional law enforcement. Unfortunately, the non-functioning government of Somalia is unable to bring police or military forces to bear against criminal piracy launched from its own territory. The predicament has done much to foster piracy, greatly growing the number of pirates and further encouraging their lawless behavior. They are well aware that the rewards of their activities far exceed the risks. With the potential to make millions of dollars through extortion, the Somalia-based pirates take comfort in having no fear of being arrested in their homes for their crimes, and obviously have little fear of being caught on the high seas despite the presence of the combined task force. Of course, attacking pirate land bases in Somalia as the U.S. did against the Barbary pirates in Tripoli two centuries ago is not a simple proposition. Even without a functioning government present in Somalia, the U.S. and other countries whose ships are threatened are not free to conduct military operations on Somali soil at will. There are many complicated legal issues concerning sovereignty and laws of armed conflict that need to be thought through before any real action can be initiated. However, these issues must be explored so that the option of a more forceful policy can be duly considered. iReport.com: How should the U.S. respond? Some may argue that the destruction of the ships and bases of pirates is merely attacking the symptom without curing the disease. They believe that piracy cannot be defeated until its causes are sufficiently addressed. These causes are usually identified as abysmal economic conditions and the lack of a strong national infrastructure. Previous attempts to undertake larger scale law-and-order projects in Somalia, however, have resulted in a tragedy now memorialized in the national psyche simply as Black Hawk Down. Hence my argument for consideration of smaller-scale actions targeted specifically against the criminal pirates. Retaliatory and preemptive strikes on known bases are certainly not the only options in dealing with the Somalia pirates, but current policy has already proven to be fairly futile in dissuading attacks. iReport.com: 'Stop the pirates, Obama!' Those who desire to combat piracy by bringing stability to Somalia must accept that the noble effort will take several years, potentially leaving thousands of ships vulnerable to attack in the meantime. One thing is for certain: Allowing the pirates to have sanctuary while also giving them a clear advantage in the rules of engagement is not going to stop their activities any time soon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Wilkerson.","Tom Wilkerson: Pirates based in Somalia represent threat to crews and cargo .

"(CNN) -- Retired Gen. Colin Powell has a choice blend of political and military experience, and many thought he'd make a great president, but Powell said Wednesday that he just didn't have it in him. Colin Powell, left, embraces Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel at the inauguration Tuesday. His wife, Alma, had feared that such an endeavor would change their family life. She also had concerns about Powell's safety, he said Wednesday on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""But I was a soldier. That wasn't my concern,"" he said. ""I never found inside of me the internal passion that you've got to have to run for elected office."" Many GOP pundits had hoped Powell, who served as secretary of state under President George W. Bush and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Bush's father and President Clinton, would make a run at the Oval Office. The former four-star general and Vietnam War veteran's military credentials are staunch, rivaled only by his accomplishments as a statesman.  Watch Powell explain why the White House wasn't for him » . In addition to chairing the Joint Chiefs, the lifelong Republican served as national security adviser under President Reagan and oversaw the 1989 invasion of Panama that toppled Gen. Manuel Noriega as well as Operation Desert Storm during the 1991 Gulf War. He has two Presidential Medals of Freedom to his name. As Bush's secretary of state, he spearheaded efforts to increase U.S. foreign assistance throughout the world, and he helped develop Bush's HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment program, which is credited with being the largest such endeavor ever. However, Powell drew heavy criticism over his remarks before the United Nations that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Powell made the assertion while attempting to convince the world body that the U.S. should go to war with Iraq. Powell abruptly retired from Bush's Cabinet in 2005, but he did not cite his time a secretary of state Wednesday when explaining why he never sought the presidency. ""I never woke up a single morning to go think about this, to talk to people about it and find in my heart and soul the passion that a Barack Obama or a John McCain or a George Bush or a Bill Clinton had,"" he said. ""It just wasn't me, and you've got to be true to yourself, and I've tried to be true to myself."" The stance is not new for Powell, who held a news conference in November 1995 to announce that he would not run for president. ""To offer myself as a candidate for president requires a commitment and a passion to run the race and to succeed in the quest,"" he said then, ""a passion and commitment that, despite my every effort, I do not yet have for political life, because such a life requires a calling that I do not yet hear."" No stranger to advising presidents, Powell told CNN that Obama has a great deal of work ahead. Not only does he have to deal with the crisis du jour -- like righting the economy at home -- he needs to keep his eyes on crises abroad while never foregoing long-range planning.  Watch what Powell says Obama must do » . ""You can never avoid it,"" he said. ""Once you're the president, every crisis comes to your desk, and you have to deal with it. ... But that doesn't mean that you can't stand back and look farther out."" Repairing America's broken image and poverty alleviation -- both at home and abroad -- will pose major challenges, he said, and both have wide-ranging implications. Poverty incubates terror, and it is incumbent upon the U.S. to stamp out the hunger, unemployment and illiteracy that breed suicide bombers and other insurgents, Powell said. He called poverty alleviation ""one of the most important challenges facing the world."" ""For those of us who are wealthy, we should reach out not only to our own citizens who need help, but the rest of the world,"" he said. ""If you want to get rid of sources of terrorism, if you want to get people moving in the right direction, you've got to help them get jobs, clean water, health care for their kids, educate their kids -- and America has a great responsibility to do this."" Obama also needs to consider what other nations think of the U.S. and help repair the American reputation. The challenge is daunting, but Powell said America's good standing is ""recoverable."" The sea of diverse faces in attendance at Obama's inauguration ceremony speaks to the reverence that America still enjoys in the world, said the son of Jamaican immigrants and father of three. If Obama can turn the economy around and rectify situations in Iraq and other parts of the Middle East, he will begin repairing the nation's image, ""because there's still a solid, residual level of affection and respect for the United States of America."" But Powell acknowledges that his former boss and Obama's predecessor made things difficult. ""Iraq and the Guantanamo situation -- which I have been preaching for years should have been closed years ago -- Abu Ghraib and a lack of progress in the Middle East and a certain way in which we deal with the world on international issues, I think damaged our reputation with the world,"" he said. Obama is off to a good start, he said, and is doing the right thing by reaching across the aisle for help. It was gracious of Obama to hold a dinner in Sen. John McCain's honor after a testy campaign and gracious of McCain to accept, and Powell said he hopes that spirit will permeate Obama's presidency. Powell conceded, though, that bipartisanship won't always be the answer to Obama's problems and said the 44th president will need to rely on the wisdom of those who forged the country more than two centuries ago. ""We're supposed to be a partisan country. That's the way the founding fathers intended for us to move forward,"" he said. ""People have strong views on both sides of an issue. Argue it out. Fight it out, just like they did in that summer of 1787 when they were writing the Constitution -- and then ultimately both sides make compromises in order to achieve consensus, and then you move the country forward.""

"(CNN)  -- For Sherrie Muldoon, the credit card debt was $46,244. But the relief she felt after paying it off was priceless. So much so that the Colorado resident and her husband threw a party Saturday for friends and family after mailing off the final check. The event at a community center featured a cake decorated with the debt amount in green icing, CNN television affiliate KUSA reported. The couple had been paying the debt for three years and seven months, Muldoon told CNN, adding that the last payment they made recently was for $1,500. ""When we mailed that last check ... I sat down in the car, I looked over to my husband and I just burst out into tears,"" she said. iReport.com: Have you paid off a huge debt lately? The typical American household with at least one credit card has nearly $10,700 in credit card debt, according to CardWeb.com. The average interest rate runs in the mid- to high teens, according to the Web site. Muldoon said the soaring costs of their nine credit cards left them with two options: Either file for bankruptcy or make a drastic lifestyle change. They opted for the latter, she told KUSA. ""We changed everything ... to bare-bones minimum,"" Muldoon told CNN. ""Basically, if it wasn't essential to support life, we didn't do it."" The Muldoons are part of a national trend in easing off credit card use. Total consumer borrowing fell 3.5 percent in February, from the month before, according to the Federal Reserve. A government report shows the tumble in consumer credit was caused by a sharp decline in credit card use. The ailing economy and controlled spending caused by unemployment have contributed. Muldoon said she found a way to make money by doing extra jobs, including teaching fitness classes at night and cleaning office buildings on the weekends.  Watch Muldoon describe how she whittled away at debt » . ""Dan says I'm obsessed. I prefer the term 'focus-driven,' "" Muldoon told KUSA. ""There were times last winter when dinner was white rice and gravy. That was what there was. We weren't starving to death, but I can't tell you the last time I had a steak."" Muldoon said the quest to save money extended to the party, which she hosted using items that were either on sale or had been purchased with coupons. No steak was served there, either: She used ham from ""a couple of pigs"" she raised last year. Despite the merriment, she had one regret: She had paid full price for the black balloons that adorned the party room. ""I had some anguish over that,"" she said.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- They left home with hope in their hearts, thousands of fans true to the Liverpool anthem, dreaming of reaching another Wembley FA Cup Final. The disaster at Hillsborough football stadium in 1989 resulted in the deaths of 96 football supporters. But what began as a day out in the spring sunshine 20 years ago ended as the darkest hour in the history of British football. I had settled into Row B Seat 2 of the press box in the south stand at Hillsborough, home to Sheffield Wednesday and neutral venue for the game. From there I would have had an uninterrupted view of the semifinal showdown between Liverpool and Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. Clough, one of the legends of the British game, had been denied an FA Cup Final with Forest a year earlier, when his side lost to Liverpool at the same stage of the competition and at the same venue. The atmosphere in the ground for the 1989 semifinal exploded as the teams emerged onto the pitch. But none of us was prepared for what was to follow. The match action lasted less than six minutes. I can't remember a single kick. What I do recall quite vividly are the scenes of distress, desperation and death at the Liverpool end that destroyed so many families and shocked the world. Looking to my left and behind Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar's goal, I was drawn to a huge mushroom-like effect among the crowd in the central standing enclosures around kick-off time.  See Liverpool players and fans paying tribute to victims of Hillsborough disaster » . The match had not long started when the first signs of a major problem surfaced. Fans began frantically attempting to climb over the perimeter fence to escape the crush at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. I didn't know it at the time, but the swell was the exit point of a tunnel that ran under the stand. Through it hundreds of Liverpool fans had attempted to make their way without realizing the two caged pens it led to were already overcrowded. Many had the life squeezed out of them in that tunnel. Others were trampled or crushed to death on the terraces. The lucky ones clambered to safety, many collapsing on the pitch. Some fans were hoisted up into the stand above by fellow supporters, but the main escape route was over the high perimeter fence and later through a small gate that was forced open as police -- who initially thought they were dealing with a pitch invasion -- recognized the true scale of the problem. Advertising boards were used as makeshift stretchers and some of those being carried away had their heads covered by coats. The Sheffield Wednesday gymnasium became a mortuary. The Liverpool end of the pitch resembled a casualty station with frantic efforts being made to treat the injured and save lives while others wandered aimlessly around the pitch in a daze. I will always remember the bid to revive one young fan in front of the main stand. Those efforts seemed to go on forever before finally hundreds of spectators let out a huge cheer as the lad at last showed some sign of life. I still wonder to this day whether or not he made it. Meanwhile I had an open phoneline to a copytaker at The Press Association and described those shocking events unfolding in front of me, including news of the first fatalities. For the second time in four years I had gone to cover a football match and ended up filing a disaster report. In 1985 I had been in Brussels with Liverpool to cover their European Cup final against Juventus, when 39 fans, mainly Italian, were killed at the Heysel stadium as a wall collapsed after trouble on the terraces. That match eventually went ahead after a delay of 85 minutes. Within hhours of returning from Belgium, I was among a small group of football writers summoned to No. 10 Downing Street for a meeting with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Mrs Thatcher planned draconian measures to combat what became known as the English disease, but it was the appalling events at Sheffield that finally became the catalyst for change. The Hillsborough tragedy was played out in full view of 53,000 spectators and TV cameras. People who came to watch a football match went home haunted by scenes of carnage and chaos that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Later, in an area beneath the empty south stand, FA chief executive Graham Kelly faced media at an impromptu press conference and expressed his shock, sadness and sorrow. Understandably, he didn't have all the answers as questions were fired his way. What led to the disaster is well documented. Lord Justice Taylor, a High Court judge commissioned by the government to produce a report, concluded that police operational errors were largely to blame for allowing the gates to be opened to relieve congestion outside the ground. Many questioned why the kickoff to the game had not been delayed. English football was quick to react with perimeter fences pulled, followed by the phased-in arrival of all-seater stadia. In the aftermath grieving fans turned Liverpool's Kop stand and the Anfield pitch into a shrine draped with thousands of scarves, flags and flowers. A permanent memorial to the victims was later erected adjacent to the Shankly Gates -- named after the club's most famous manager -- and which bear the title of the Reds' anthem: You'll Never Walk Alone. The oldest victim at Hillsborough was 67, the youngest 10-year-old Jon-Paul Gilhooley, a cousin of current Liverpool captain and England international Steven Gerrard. Gerrard was six weeks away from his ninth birthday at the time of tragedy. There is nothing Liverpool would want more than to mark the 20th anniversary season with at least one gleaming trophy. They did it in 1989, beating Forest when the semifinal was later replayed, then going on to defeat city rivals Everton after extra time at Wembley. On that occasion they returned home with hope in their hearts.","96 Liverpool fans died as a result of the Hillsborough disaster on April 15, 1989 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Promising ""a new era of openness in our country,"" President Obama signed executive orders Wednesday relating to ethics guidelines for staff members of his administration. Members of the National Economic Council brief President Obama on the economy Wednesday. ""Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency,"" Obama said. In his first full day in office, Obama touched upon many of the major issues facing his administration, and even carved out time to retake the oath of office. The move was aimed at dispelling any confusion that might arise from Tuesday's oath, which Chief Justice John Roberts flubbed by mixing up the order of the words. The do-over was also intended to erase any questions regarding the legitimacy of Obama's presidency, although per the Constitution, Obama became president at noon Tuesday without taking the oath. Earlier in the day, Obama said he would issue a pay freeze for his senior staff members. The new president has also promised swift action on the beleaguered economy. House Democrats, at Obama's urging, have signed an $825 billion economic recovery package that the president says will save or create up to 4 million jobs and invest in health care, energy and education.  Watch Obama address his staff » . House Republican leaders, however, asked to meet with Obama on Thursday to offer major changes to the recovery proposal. ""The challenge as we see it is to create a plan that helps middle-class taxpayers and small businesses without wasting money or exploding our national deficit,"" the leaders wrote in a letter to the new president. Rep. Paul Ryan, the top Republican on the House Budget committee, argued that the main tax provision in the Democrats' plan -- cutting payroll taxes -- was not an effective way to jump-start the economy. House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence declined to say whether the Democrats' package would get any Republican support if it didn't change significantly. Obama also moved fast to address a campaign promise to close the controversial Guantanamo Bay detention facility. The administration is drafting executive orders calling for the closure of the detention facility, according to two administration officials. Obama began the day with a moment of solitude in the Oval Office. When he arrived, he spent 10 minutes alone there, reading a note left for him on a desk by outgoing President George W. Bush. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel met with the president 10 minutes later to discuss the daily schedule, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said. Obama called Middle East leaders, including King Abdullah of Jordan, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Gibbs said. On Sunday, Israel and Palestinian militants declared a cease-fire after 22 days of fighting in Gaza. First lady Michelle Obama joined her husband in the Oval Office at 9:10 a.m., shortly before the first couple departed for the National Prayer Service at Washington National Cathedral. Later in the day, Obama and the first lady greeted those who came to the White House for a formal open house. Obama joked, ""Don't break anything."" Obama also met with his economic team and top brass from the Pentagon. iReport.com: What do you think Obama should do first? Later in the afternoon, he met with the Ambassador to Iraq, the commander in Iraq, and the ""theater commander"" in the region for an update on the situation in Iraq. ""The meeting was productive and I very much appreciated receiving assessments from these experienced and dedicated individuals. During the discussion, I asked the military leadership to engage in additional planning necessary to execute a responsible military drawdown from Iraq,"" he said in a statement. ""In the coming days and weeks, I will also visit the Department of Defense to consult with the Joint Chiefs on these issues, and we will undertake a full review of the situation in Afghanistan in order to develop a comprehensive policy for the entire region,"" he said. He plans to tell the top U.S. officers that he wants them to plan to have combat forces out of Iraq in 16 months, as he promised during his election campaign, an adviser said.","NEW: Obama retakes oath of office Wednesday night .

"(CNN) -- The possibility of engine fires has prompted General Motors to recall nearly 1.5 million passenger sedans manufactured between 1997 and 2003, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Monday. The recall involves certain GM vehicles in which oil apparently can leak and ignite. The recall covers certain mid- and full-size passenger sedans under GM's Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac brands. The affected vehicles have naturally aspirated 3.8 liter V6 engines -- that is, engines that use atmospheric pressure rather than a mechanical blower to bring in air for combustion -- according to documents that GM filed with federal regulators last week. On Friday, the federal government acknowledged the filing and agreed to the plan. The problem involves a potential for oil to leak on the exhaust manifold during hard braking. When a car operates under normal conditions, the manifold can get very hot. Oil that runs below the manifold's heat shield could ignite and spread to plastic channels that hold spark plug wires. As a solution, the company recommends a change in the bracket that holds spark plug wires, which will be done free of charge. Owners and dealers affected by the recall will be notified by letter next month with details. The vehicles involved are: • 1997-2003 Buick Regals. • 1998-2003 Chevrolet Luminas, Monte Carlos and Impalas. • 1998-1999 Oldsmobile Intrigues. • 1997-2003 Pontiac Grand Prix. GM issued a recall on a similar engine in 2008, according to the company's filing with the government. That problem was traced to a faulty gasket on the engine rocker cover.","Recall involves certain Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac sedans .

"(CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has urged the leaders of Madagascar to resolve their differences after an anti-government rally a day earlier turned violent and left more than two dozen people dead. Protesters rally Saturday before violence broke out near the Presidential Palace. In a statement issued by his spokesperson, Ban deplored the violence and called Sunday on authorities ""to urgently initiate a fair process by which those responsible will be brought to justice."" Ban also blamed the ""tragedy"" on a ""lack of restraint on all sides."" ""The Secretary-General calls upon all concerned parties to resolve their differences through peaceful and democratic means and through the exercise of responsible leadership,"" according to the statement. A police official said the death toll from Saturday's violence outside the Presidential Palace in the capital city of Antananarivo had risen to 26. More than 80 were injured during the demonstration, officials said. The capital city was quiet as mourners attended a public ceremony for the dead. The violence stemmed from an ongoing dispute over who is in charge of the government. Andry Rajoelina, the mayor of Antananarivo, took to the streets one week ago, declaring himself the Indian Ocean island nation's leader after a week of violence and looting that killed at least 80 people and wounded more than 300.  Watch an iReport on the Madagascar violence » . But President Marc Ravalomanana has fired him and put someone else in the mayoral job. Rajoelina had called the rally to unveil his new government at the May 13th Plaza, according to Brittany Martin, an American citizen who is a Harvard Fellow and lives in Antananarivo. Martin said the rally was peaceful in the morning hours of Saturday, until gunshots rang out in the afternoon after the protesters marched from the plaza to the palace. She said it was unclear where the shots were coming from. Some media reports blamed foreign mercenaries for the shootings; others said army guards were responsible or that the army was firing at the mercenaries to protect the crowd. Violence in Madagascar began January 26, when protesters stormed state-run television and radio stations in Antananarivo. Hours earlier, the government had shut down a radio station owned by Rajoelina and, weeks ago, had similarly shut down Rajoelina's television station after it aired an interview with ex-President Didier Ratsiraka.  See pictures from last week's upheaval » . Ravalomanana took power in 2001 after ousting Ratsiraka in a tense, hotly contested election. Ratsiraka fled to France afterward. Loyalists blame Ratsiraka's family members for inciting the recent trouble. Anger has risen in Madagascar, where the World Bank says the average person earns about $320 a year, over reports that Ravalomanana recently bought a $60 million airplane. Rajoelina has urged supporters to demand the resignation of Ravalomanana and said he planned to take charge until a transition government could be established in the nation off Africa's southeastern coast.

He said he had received reports that palace guards used tear gas and shot into the air to try and disperse the crowd.

"(CNN) -- President Obama stepped into office with big approval ratings met with high expectations as he faces a deteriorating economic situation, an unpopular war in Iraq and the Middle East conflict. The economy has been the main focus of the first week of President Obama's presidency. In his first week, Obama has focused on the economy, but he's also addressed other campaign promises. Bill Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst, describes Obama's first week as a ""neat balancing act."" As Obama signs executive orders signaling a clear change of direction, he's also working hard to get bipartisan support for his economic stimulus, Schneider said. ""Mr. Obama doesn't have to do that. He could get a stimulus bill passed almost entirely with Democratic votes. But Obama doesn't want to be yet another president who divides the country,"" he said. The president has been working the phones with his party and made an unusual trip to Capitol Hill to meet with the opposing party to rally support for his $825 billion economic aid package. Following a meeting Tuesday with GOP congressman, Obama said he respects the ""legitimate philosophical differences"" between Democrats and Republicans on how to stimulate the economy. ""I don't expect 100 percent agreement,"" he said. ""But I hope we can put politics aside.""  Watch more on Obama's economic push » . Throughout the election season, Obama campaigned on his plan to restore economic equilibrium, and in his first public remarks after winning the election, he vowed to ""confront this economic crisis head-on."" Obama faces his first test with Congress on Wednesday when the House of Representatives votes on his economic recovery plan. The president has said he hopes to have the plan passed by Congress and on his desk for signing by mid-February. Obama also has wasted no time in putting his military and diplomatic agendas into action. In his first week, he already promised to send as many as 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan to boost the U.S. presence on the ground and increase development and reconstruction assistance. Seeking to demonstrate the Obama administration's early commitment to the country, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met last week with Afghan women legal professionals who were in Washington on a State Department training program on justice reform in Afghanistan. Obama also has pledged to crack down on militants in neighboring Pakistan. During the campaign season, Obama received a lot of criticism for saying that if it were necessary to root out terrorists, he would send U.S. forces into Pakistan without the country's approval. The president has called Afghanistan and Pakistan the ""central front in our enduring struggle against terrorism and extremism,"" and Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Tuesday that missile strikes in Pakistan will continue to root out al Qaeda members. ""Let me just say, both President Bush and President Obama have made clear that we will go after al Qaeda wherever al Qaeda is. And we will continue to pursue this,"" Gates said. As Obama seeks to stabilize the region, his administration has been advocating multilateralism and stressing ""smart power"" diplomacy by using all the tools of foreign policy available. Obama dispatched newly appointed Middle East envoy George Mitchell to the region and tapped diplomatic heavyweight Richard Holbrooke as his special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Obama also gave his first formal interview as president to Al-Arabiya, an Arab news channel, sending a message to the region that he wants a dialogue. ""My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy,"" Obama told the Dubai-based satellite television network. ""We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect.""  Watch how Obama is reaching out to Muslims » . During his run for the White House, Obama pledged to improve ties with the Muslim world, draw down U.S. troops in Iraq and close the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Two days after his inauguration, Obama issued an executive order to close the camp within a year. Another order formally bans torture by requiring that the Army Field Manual be used as the guide for terrorism interrogations, essentially ending the Bush administration's CIA program of ""enhanced interrogation"" methods. Guantanamo Bay and reports of torture there were huge points of contention for the Bush administration and were widely considered to have damaged the reputation of the United States. In another reversal of his predecessor, Obama struck down a rule that prohibited U.S. money from funding international family-planning clinics that promote abortion or provide counseling or referrals about abortion services. In a statement, Obama said that family planning aid has been used as a ""political wedge issue,"" adding that he had ""no desire to continue this stale and fruitless debate."" As Obama moves into the second week of his presidency, polls show that most Americans approve of the way he is handling his job so far. Former President Carter said he thinks Obama is ""doing just great."" ""I was particularly gratified that he carried out his promise, which didn't surprise me, that he would start working on the Middle East peace process the first time he was in office and not wait until the last year he was in office,"" Carter said on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Carter said he has confidence in Obama on economic issues, but he cautioned that the expectations for the new president are too high. ""I think a lot of the expenditures that will come as rapidly as possible might not occur until maybe 18 months from now -- some earlier. So we're going to have to be patient,"" he said. President Bush also won praise during the first week of his first term for staying on message. He built his first week around education and received positive reviews in the media during his honeymoon period. Bush's predecessor, however, was not met with such a warm welcome. President Clinton's showdown with Congress over the question of gays in the military and the withdrawal of his attorney general nominee overshadowed early efforts to move ahead with his agenda.","President Obama faces first test with vote on $825 billion economic stimulus plan .

"(CNN)  -- A roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan killed a female Canadian soldier and wounded four other troops, the Canadian military said Tuesday. Trooper Karine Blais, 21, is the second Canadian female soldier to die in Afghanistan. Trooper Karine Blais was killed Monday when the troops' armored vehicle struck the bomb. The attack occurred north of Kandahar in the Shah Wali Kowt District of Kandahar province. Blais' death was the 117th Canadian troop fatality in the Afghan war, and she is the second Canadian female soldier killed in Afghanistan. The first, Capt. Nichola Goddard, was killed in a May 2006 firefight with insurgents in Kandahar province, where Canadian troops have been based during the conflict. Brig. Gen. Jonathan Vance, commander of Canadian troops in Afghanistan, called the 21-year-old Blais ""an energetic soldier who gave 100 percent to every challenge she faced using a unique sense of humor based on her honesty and frankness."" Vance said Blais ""demonstrated the qualities of a future leader"" and was ""respected by all members of her squadron."" ""Our thoughts are with the friends and family of our fallen comrade during this difficult time,"" the Canadian Forces said in a news release. ""All members of Task Force Kandahar are thinking of the family and friends of our fallen comrades during this sad time. We will not forget their sacrifice as we continue to bring security and hope to the people of Kandahar province."" Blais, from the 12th Canadian Armored Regiment at Valcartier, Quebec, near Quebec City, was serving with the 2nd Battalion, Royal 22th Regiment Battle Group. A chopper evacuated the four other troops to a medical facility at Kandahar airfield.

"(CNN)  -- Pro wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, embroiled in a bitter divorce with his wife, Linda, told Rolling Stone magazine he can ""totally understand"" O.J. Simpson, the former football great found liable for the deaths of his wife and another man. Linda and Hulk Hogan enjoy happier times at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards in New York in 2006. ""I could have turned everything into a crime scene like O.J., cutting everybody's throat,"" Hogan said in the interview for a feature that will run in Friday's edition of the magazine. ""You live half a mile from the 20,000-square-foot home you can't go to anymore, you're driving through downtown Clearwater [Florida] and see a 19-year-old boy driving your Escalade, and you know that a 19-year-old boy is sleeping in your bed, with your wife ... ""I totally understand O.J. I get it,"" Hogan said. A spokeswoman for Rolling Stone magazine confirmed the quote to CNN.  Watch report on Hogan's statements » . It has been widely reported that Linda Hogan, 49, is dating a younger man. She filed for divorce in 2007 after nearly 25 years of marriage. Simpson was found not guilty of murder in the 1994 stabbing deaths of his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman, but was found liable for their deaths by a civil court jury. Simpson later was found guilty in a Las Vegas, Nevada, armed robbery case and sentenced in December to up to 33 years in prison. A spokesman for Linda Hogan said Wednesday that the statement amounts to a death threat and that her attorney is ""weighing all options necessary to protect his client."" ""Sadly, his recent comments remind us that his definition of fair is much different than what the law dictates,"" Linda Hogan said in a written statement. Her spokesman, Gary Smith, linked the comments to the 55-year-old Hogan's three-decade career, during which he held multiple championship titles and, during his heyday in the 1980s, was easily the most popular wrestler in the world. ""We have always maintained that the fear that Linda has had to live with comes from the rage and instability much too often associated with pro wrestlers,"" Smith said in the statement. CNN was unable to reach Hulk Hogan's publicist for comment on Wednesday. In comments to Access Hollywood, a spokesman said the comments were not intended as a threat and that Hogan ""in no way condones"" Simpson's actions. ""As part of a larger conversation, he referred to it to exemplify his frustration with his own situation,"" the spokesman said. Hulk Hogan's real name is Terry Bollea.

"(CNN) -- The Mojave boneyard in the California desert is where old airplanes go to die -- a wasteland of decrepit planes, titanic heaps of titanium and aluminum waiting to be scrapped for metal in India or China. Plane boneyards are a rich source of spare parts for MotoArt to create their functional furniture. But for Dave Hall and Donovan Fell, the boneyard is only the beginning. They own MotoArt, a company based in California that turns old aircraft parts into high-end furniture and functional art. From beds and desks to light fixtures and wall partitions, Hall and Fell say they are doing more than reinventing cast-offs from retired planes, they're creating pieces of aviation history. ""Once they are gone we can never get them back again,"" said Hall of the abandoned planes at Mojave. ""So what we like to do is actually take these aircraft parts and preserve them and give them a second life in some really fun, functional art."" MotoArt began in 2000 when Hall and Fell, former co-workers at an architectural sign company in Los Angeles, collaborated on an art exhibition that showcased Fell's polished B-17 bomber propeller sculptures.  See before and after photos of recycled plane parts » . ""We sold out the entire show, and the gearheads all loved it,"" said Fell. It was then that the duo realized their unique art project could have a much wider audience. Encouraged by the success of the exhibit, the duo began exploring the nearby Mojave boneyard for more than just propellers -- B-25 rudders for desks, 747 jet engine cowlings for beds, F-4 ejection seats for, well, ejection seats. ""Who's never wanted an ejection chair?"" laughs Fell, sitting in the company's studio in Los Angeles, where the MotoArt team bring back the treasures they find in the Mojave Desert.  Watch Dave Hall at work at the Mojave boneyard » . The duo's most popular pieces of 'functional art' are their desks, ranging from the sleek 8-foot DC-9 tail stabilizer desk, which retail at around $15,000, to the imposing 14-foot DC-4 conference table, which costs a whopping $60,000. According to Hall, hundreds of hours are sometimes spent cutting, sanding, polishing and surfacing a single piece. It took the MotoArt team 220 hours to turn a single 747 cowling, the large shiny aluminum strip covering a jumbo jet engine, into a spectacular 8.5-foot diameter chrome receptionist's desk. Hall said it takes hundreds of hours to produce a fuselage partition, from using a chainsaw to slice 10-foot sheets out of the main section of a plane, to polishing and readying it for the showroom floor of the Dutch carmaker Spyker, which has commissioned MotoArt to create exhibitions for the company around the world. Hall and Fell began the company out of their garage, and now have 15 employees and a 12,000 square-foot studio with a showroom that could double as an aviation museum. ""It's like a larger version of my room when I was 10 years old,"" says Fell of the MotoArt headquarters. But MotoArt is anything but child's play -- in just nine years the company has carved out a niche in the high-end furniture market, creating a multi-million dollar business thanks to a wide range of corporate clients. The company counts Boeing, Microsoft, Red Bull and the United States government as happy MotoArt customers, as well as a number of airplane enthusiasts and celebrities. But for Hall and Fell, it is the preservation of the planes that gives them the greatest satisfaction. ""It's heartbreaking to see these planes that have serviced our country for decades being crunched up and destroyed, and it gives us a little piece of heart that we are able to recycle this and give it a second life,"" he said.","Men at MotoArt search boneyards for old plane parts to recycle into furniture .

"(Mental Floss) -- President-Elect Obama's mother-in-law will be moving to Washington with the first family, at least temporarily, his transition team has confirmed. Marian Robinson will be the latest in a line of presidential in-laws who, for good or ill, lived under the same roof as the president. President Dwight Eisenhower and his mother-in-law, Elivera  Doud, pose for pictures with some of the grandchildren. Here are four stories that confirm the old truism: While America can choose its president, the president can't choose his in-laws. 1. Ulysses S. Grant and 'The Colonel' You would think that the Civil War was settled at Appomattox, and no question of its outcome would have been raised in the White House of Ulysses S. Grant, who, after all, was the general who won the war. But you would be wrong, because living with Ulysses and Julia Grant was the president's father-in-law. Colonel Frederick Dent (his rank seems to have been self-selected) was an unreconstructed Confederate, a St. Louis businessman and slaveholder who, when his daughter Julia went to the Executive Mansion early in 1869, decided to relocate there as well. The Colonel didn't hesitate to make himself at home. When his daughter received guests, he sat in a chair just behind her, offering anyone within earshot unsolicited advice. Political and business figures alike got a dose of the Colonel's mind as they waited to meet with President Grant. When the president's father, Jesse Grant, came from Kentucky on one of his regular visits to Washington, the White House turned into a Civil War reenactment. According to ""First Families: The Impact of the White House on Their Lives"", by Bonnie Angelo, Jesse Grant preferred to stay in a hotel rather than sleep under the same roof as the Colonel. And when the two old partisans found themselves unavoidably sitting around the same table in the White House, they avoided direct negotiations by using Julia and her young son, named for the president's father, as intermediaries, Betty Boyd Caroli writes in ""First Ladies"": ""In the presence of the elder Grant, Frederick Dent would instruct Julia to 'take better care of that old gentleman [Jesse Grant]. He is feeble and deaf as a post and yet you permit him to wander all over Washington alone.' And Grant replied [to his grandson and namesake], 'Did you hear him? I hope I shall not live to become as old and infirm as your Grandfather Dent.'"" Mental Floss: 5 feisty first daughters . The Colonel remained in the White House -- irascible and unrepentant -- until his death, at age 88, in 1873. 2. Harry S Truman and the Mother-in-Law from Heck . Harry Truman and Bess Wallace met as children. He was a farm boy; she was the well-heeled granddaughter of Independence, Missouri's Flour King. When they married in 1919, Truman was a struggling haberdasher, and Bess's mother, Madge Wallace, thought Bess had made a colossal social faux pas. Until she died in 1952, Madge Wallace never changed her mind about Harry Truman. Her Bess had married way below her station. Madge had plenty of opportunities to let her son-in-law know it. The newlyweds moved into the Wallace mansion in Independence, and the three lived together under the same roof until the end of Madge's life. When Harry Truman was elected senator, ""Mother Wallace,"" as Truman judiciously called her, moved with her daughter and son-in-law to Washington. In the family's apartment, she shared a bedroom with the Trumans' daughter, Margaret. And when Truman became president, she moved with them into the White House, where she cast her cold eye on the new commander-in-chief. ""Why would Harry run against that nice Mr. Dewey?"" she wondered aloud, as Truman was fighting for his political life in the 1948 presidential race, according to ""First Mothers"" by Bonnie Angelo. And when Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur for insubordination, Mother Wallace was scandalized. ""Imagine a captain from the National Guard [Truman] telling off a West Point general!"" In December 1952, shortly before Truman's term ended, Madge Wallace died, at age 90. For the 33 years they lived together, she never called her son-in-law anything but ""Mr. Truman"" to his face. Mental Floss: Presidential siblings and the headaches they caused . 3. Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Mother-in-Law of the Year . If Truman's story sounds like the set-up for a film noir, his successor's relationship with his mother-in-law might have been a Technicolor musical. Elivera Mathilda Carlson Doud, Mamie Eisenhower's mother, was ""a witty woman with a tart tongue,"" Time magazine wrote, and Dwight Eisenhower thought she was a hoot. ""She refuted every mother-in-law joke ever made,"" Time wrote. There was no question that she would join her daughter and son-in-law in the White House. Ike called her ""Min,"" the name of a character in the Andy Gump comic strip. Ike and Min ""constituted a mutual admiration society, and each took the other's part whenever a family disagreement would arise,"" said Eisenhower's son, John. The New York Times observed, ""The president frequently looks around him sharply, and inquires, 'Where's Min?'"" Widowed shortly before Eisenhower became president, Min spent the winters in the White House and summers at her home in Denver. It was while visiting his mother-in-law's home that Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in 1955. Two years later, in failing health, Min returned permanently to Denver. She died in 1960, at age 82. 4. Benjamin Harrison and the Reverend Doctor . Benjamin Harrison's father-in-law, John Witherspoon Scott, bore a double title: ""reverend doctor."" Scott was born in Pennsylvania in 1800, did post-graduate work at Yale and took a professorship in mathematics and science at Miami University, in Ohio. He was also a Presbyterian minister and an outspoken abolitionist. The reverend doctor was rumored to have shielded runaway slaves in his home as a stop on the Underground Railroad. Whatever the truth, Miami University dismissed him for his anti-slavery beliefs. He accepted a post at Farmer's College, a prep school in Cincinnati, where he became a mentor of a student named Benjamin Harrison. During his visits to the Scott home, Harrison became friendly with the reverend doctor's daughter, Caroline. Young Harrison spent so many evenings at the Scotts' home that he got the nickname ""the pious moonlight dude,"" according to ""The Complete Book of the Presidents"" by William A. DeGregorio. He and Caroline were married in 1853 at the bride's house. The reverend doctor officiated. John Witherspoon Scott later became a clerk in the pension office of the interior department. He gave up the position when Harrison was elected president in 1888. A widower since 1876, Scott moved into the White House with his daughter and their family. It was the president's custom to lead the family in a half-hour of Bible reading and prayer after breakfast, Anne Chieko Moore and Hester Anne Hale wrote in ""Benjamin Harrison: Centennial President."" When the president was absent, his father-in-law took his place. Caroline Harrison died in October 1892, two weeks before her husband lost the presidential election. Her father died the next month, at age 92. An obituary described John Witherspoon Scott as ""a man of wonderful physical vigor, tall, broad chested and well preserved mentally.""

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- One could say she has the determination ... but lacks the drive. Driving agency estimates woman has spent more than $2,888 in exam fees. A 68-year-old South Korean woman this week signed up to take her driving test once again -- after failing to earn a license the first 771 times. The woman, identified only as Cha, first took the written portion of the exam in April 2005, said Choi Young-cheol of the Driver's License Agency in the southwestern city of Jeonju. At the time, she made her living selling goods door-to-door and figured she would need a car to help her get around, Choi told CNN. She failed the test. She retook the test the next day and failed again. And again. And again.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- She's been called the ""mother of the believers,"" a middle-aged woman possibly responsible for recruiting more than 80 female suicide bombers in Iraq and involvement in at least 28 terrorist operations. Television picture reportedly showing Samira Ahmed Jassim during her alleged confession. Now she's in jail, arrested on January 21 in what an Iraqi commander called ""heroic"" security force operations that unfolded without ""any losses."" Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, spokesman for the Baghdad command, identified the suspect as Samira Ahmed Jassim, also known as Umm-al-Moumineen, or ""the mother of the believers."" The arrest is considered a major stride in confronting the challenge of female suicide bombers, more than 30 of whom detonated themselves last year. Atta couldn't say where she was detained for intelligence reasons. That's because the authorities are after more targets. The bombers were recruited in Baghdad and Diyala province for the Ansar al-Sunna militant group, said Atta, who added police were aware of the identities of the women, including their fake names on fake IDs, and were on the hunt for them. They said they were also trying to verify Jassim's confessions. Atta played a DVD for reporters with excerpts of the confessions of Jassim, who is in her 40s or 50s. Wearing a black robe and veil, she said she was asked by a man named ""Shaker"" to recruit women for an Ansar al-Sunna operative named Hareth, also known as Abu Rami. She spoke about a number of the women she recruited, spending days talking to prospective operatives and persuading them to carry out attacks. Jassim said she would deliver a recruit to Shaker. Later, she returned and picked up the recruit, dropping them at locations like the Muqdadiya police station, a Sons of Iraq office and a Baghdad car park. One woman she recruited didn't even look at Jassim when she was picked up for a job. She just whispered Quranic verses en route to a bombing. Another woman -- described as psychologically challenged -- came from a financially hard-up family. In November, 18 would-be female suicide bombers turned themselves in to coalition forces in northern Iraq. The women, whose ages and names were not released by the military, gave themselves up after being persuaded by religious leaders and family members to ""cease their training in suicide operations and reconcile,"" the U.S. military said. The women were connected to al Qaeda in Iraq suicide bombing cells, but it was not clear where they had been training or operating. The statement also did not say where the women turned themselves in, though the northern city of Mosul and surrounding parts of northern Iraq are still a hotbed for insurgent activity and considered the last stronghold for al Qaeda in Iraq. Troops have launched operations targeting members of families of suspected female bombers trying to break up the rings that are recruiting the women and girls. Intelligence gathered from detainees indicates that al Qaeda in Iraq is looking for women with three main characteristics: those who are illiterate, are deeply religious or have financial struggles, most likely because they've lost the male head of the household. Females always have played a role in the insurgency in Iraq, helping feed militants, hiding them in their homes and helping to sneak weapons around the country. They have proven to be highly effective in their operations, because of the cultural convention that women are not to be searched by men for cultural and religious reasons. The U.S. military has created a program called the Daughters of Iraq, analogous to U.S. backed Sons of Iraq, to conduct searches of women.","Jassim also known as Umm-al-Moumineen, or mother of the believers .

"(CNN) -- Mike Myers' ""Love Guru"" may speak of ""yin and yang,"" but the Hollywood version of bad balanced by good might be the Razzies and the Oscars. Mike Myers' ""The Love Guru"" was one of the year's biggest bombs. The day before the Motion Picture Academy releases the Oscar nominations -- honoring the movie industry's best -- the Golden Raspberry Award foundation reveals nominations for the Razzies, which recognize the worst films of 2008. And in 2008, Razzie founder and self-styled ""Head Raspberry"" John Wilson said, the bad seemed to outweigh the good among the 578 movies released. ""We are saying that it wasn't just the economy that tanked,"" Wilson said. ""So did the quality of the movies being offered to those of us who don't have as much money to buy tickets."" ""All of the voting was very close this year,"" he said. ""There just was too much stuff to choose from."" The bumper crop of ""putrid motion pictures"" may be partly a result of last spring's writers' strike ""when nobody was rewriting, polishing or improving anything and it was still getting filmed,"" Wilson said. Bombs also happen when studios hedge their bets with high-priced stars by having them ""do what worked before, coming back to same well."" Which brings us back to Myers' ""Love Guru,"" which followed his hugely profitable ""Austin Powers"" franchise. Myers' portrayal of ""a platitude-spouting mystic"" leads the Razzie list for worst picture, Wilson said. It may also have been the biggest box office bomb: the film, expected to be a summer hit, lost $30 million, he said. Other worst picture nominees include ""Disaster Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans"" -- both featuring the same writer-directors and essentially the same cast. The latter film ""somehow managed to work references to Britney Spears into an ancient Spartan 'plot,' "" Wilson said. Also competing for the top dishonor is ""The Happening,"" which Wilson described as ""an eco-disaster tale whose 'villain' drew more guffaws than gasps,"" and Paris Hilton's ""The Hottie and the Nottie,"" which earned three Razzie nominations overall. ""She really is neither a movie star or an actress,"" Wilson said of Hilton. The movie -- for which Hilton was listed as executive producer -- sold only $27,000 in tickets but cost about $2 million to make. Other Razzie nominees include actor-comedian Eddie Murphy, who received two nominations for ""Meet Dave""; Oscar winner Al Pacino, who earned a Razzie nod for making ""two rotten movies this year,"" in Wilson's words (he's referring to ""88 Minutes"" and ""Righteous Kill""); and ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" which was singled out as ""Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel."" Despite the opinions of Wilson and the Razzie voters, it was the year's third-highest-grossing movie. And a rare Razzie for ""Worst Career Achievement"" will go to ""Bad Movie Uber-Meister"" Uwe Boll for ""In the Name of the King,"" Wilson said. The film, based on a video game, had a $60 million budget, yet brought in under $5 million at the box office, he said. Wilson said he began the Razzies in 1981 as a counterpoint to the Oscars. It takes guts to show up in person to accept a Razzie, but some notable actors have embraced the infamy, Wilson said. Tom Green, who made ""a horrible little thing called 'Freddy Got Fingered' "" several years ago, ""insisted that he made the film with the intent of sweeping the Razzie Awards,"" Wilson said. Green showed up to accept his three awards with great enthusiasm, he said. ""At the end of the ceremony, he launched into a harmonica solo and we had to pry his hands off the podium and physically remove him from the stage,"" Wilson said. The classiest and most memorable acceptance speech came in 2005 when Halle Berry showed up to get her worst actress Razzie for her ""Catwoman"" performance. Berry, who won a best actress Oscar for ""Monster's Ball"" in 2001, was given a one-minute standing ovation, Wilson said. ""She had her Oscar in one hand and her Razzie in the other,"" Wilson said. Berry's speech was a parody of her Academy Award acceptance and ""she was quite funny,"" he said. ""She said that her mother had taught her that if you cannot accept valid criticism, you also, by the same token, are not entitled to bask in the glory when you get the good reviews,"" he said. The appearance and her sense of humor earned Berry a lot of respect, he said. The awards show -- a ""shorter parody"" of the Oscars -- can be seen only by members and journalists in person at the Barnsdall Gallery Theatre in Hollywood on February 21. It cannot be televised or streamed online because studios would likely withhold permission for clips used in the presentation to be shown, Wilson said. Unlike the Oscars and other honors, Golden Raspberry Awards are not meant as recommendations for people to rent the DVDs, Wilson said. ""If you were going to do that, I would suggest you put away all sharp implements before putting the DVDs in your machine,"" he said.","Razzie Awards, honoring Hollywood's worst, are a counterpoint to Oscars .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office asked police to do more investigative work before a decision is made on whether charges will be filed in the domestic violence case against singer Chris Brown, according to a spokeswoman for the DA. Chris Brown attends a party saluting music producer Clive Davis in Beverly Hills, California, on Saturday. The LAPD's chief investigator in case, Detective Deshon Andrews, told CNN he hand-carried his findings to the district attorney Tuesday afternoon. Prosecutors looked at the files and then asked Andrews for ""an additional investigation,"" DA spokeswoman Jane Robinson said. Andrews said that to keep photos and documents from leaking to the media, he has kept the case file closely guarded and allowed no copies of the material to be made.  Watch the latest about the case » . Police have refused media requests to hear the 911 call that led to their investigation early Sunday, but Andrews said it mostly recorded the sound of ""a screaming woman."" Brown, 19, turned himself in Sunday night after police said they were looking for him. He was arrested on suspicion of making criminal threats. Brown was later released on a $50,000 bond. He is expected to appear in court on March 5. Police said Brown and a woman were in a vehicle near Hollywood's Hancock Park early Sunday when they became involved in an argument. The woman ""suffered visible injuries and identified Brown as her attacker,"" police said. Police did not identify the woman, but sources close to the couple told CNN the alleged victim was his girlfriend, singer Rihanna, 20.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As a career military officer, Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry is familiar with sacrifice for his country and long stretches away from home. Karl Eikenberry testifies before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee March 26. But he apparently doesn't want any more separation from his wife, Ching Eikenberry. If he is approved as the next U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan he wants her to come with him. That could collide with State Department rules. Afghanistan is designated ""an unaccompanied post"" by the department because of the dangers of the war and terror attacks. That means family members are not allowed. Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, who as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee was running Eikenberry's confirmation hearing last week, was in favor of the idea. ""I know you are hoping to take your wife there with you, and I think I certainly, and I think the committee is entirely supportive,"" Kerry said. ""I think it would be a terrific message and a strong boost of morale for the Embassy, and obviously wherever possible we should try to encourage that. So I hope that will be facilitated.""

"(AOL Autos) -- With the explosive growth of the light truck segment as well as the impending onslaught of winter, I thought it would be fitting to write about four-wheel drive systems. There are a few different types available; and there are special maintenance practices that might cause some confusion. So let's get enlightened! Four-wheel drive systems can make driving safer on wet road conditions. 4WD systems can be classified as Part Time 4WD, Full Time 4WD, and Permanent 4WD. Part Time 4WD is the most basic of all 4WD systems. It gives the driver the choice of driving in two-wheel drive or 4WD. That sounds pretty good! However, the downside is that you shouldn't engage the 4WD on pavement unless it's very slippery. That's because, with this system, when you engage 4WD you lock the front and rear wheels together through the transmission and transfer gearbox. This is great for straight-ahead traction and very slippery surfaces. However, on dry pavement it makes for odd cornering, and handling characteristics. Also you can harm the drive train components by driving in 4WD for extended periods of time on dry pavement. Consequently, you may find yourself having to stop the vehicle to engage or disengage, depending on the road conditions. AOL Autos: Top 5 SUVs . So why choose this type of system? Two good reasons: . • It's less costly to build and therefore to buy . • It's very durable under heavy stress (generally more durable than the other 4WD systems, since it has fewer components) Full Time 4WD is the most commonly used system on the market. Full Time 4WD offers both two-wheel drive mode and 4WD, depending on road conditions (driver must engage and disengage the 4WD). In addition, the 4WD mode offers both a high and low mode for when the going really gets tough (driver shifts to high or low). AOL Autos: Top 5 crossover vehicles . Besides a transmission and transfer gearbox, a center differential couples the front and rear wheels. This differential allows the front and rear wheels to turn at different speeds as needed (unlike Part-Time 4WD system) for better handling. When the wheels start to spin due to slippery road conditions, the system reacts to wheel spin by progressively locking the front and rear wheels together to optimize traction. Although Full-Time 4WD requires the driver to engage it, once engaged it offers more ""control"" through the high and low mode selection (based on road conditions) and better cornering and handling on varying road conditions due to the differential. AOL Autos: Best luxury wagons . Permanent 4WD is similar to Full-Time 4WD but it has no two-wheel drive mode. The vehicle is always in 4WD, so you don't have to determine whether conditions are right to engage it. AOL Autos: Cars with best Blue Book values . We still have transmission, transfer gearbox and center differential coupling the front and rear wheels. The only difference is that torque (or power) is constantly being applied to all the wheels, giving maximum traction in all weather and road conditions. Current systems have high and low modes for when the going gets tough; however, most importantly, the system does the thinking for you ... it automatically applies as much lock up (to all the wheels) as necessary for maximum traction. AOL Autos: Best-selling trucks and SUVs . Next, a few definitions of common 4WD-drive terms that you may have heard of: . Locking Differential - locks both wheels on the axle, forcing them to turn together to allow maximum traction . Limited-Slip Differential - detects slippage in one wheel and sends torque to the other wheel that is not spinning. It operates is automatically. On-The-Fly-Shifting - allows the 4WD to be engaged while driving the vehicle (many systems require that you stop the vehicle in order to engage the 4WD). Manual Hubs - In order for 4WD to work, you must have a means of engaging the front wheel drive mechanism. This is done through the front hubs. On vehicles equipped with manual hubs, the operator must manually ""lock in"" the front wheels by turning a mechanical switch. Automatic Hubs - Instead of manually ""locking in"" the front wheels in order to drive in 4WD, automatic hubs ""lock in"" the front wheels by a simple flip of an electrical switch in the comfort of your warm, cushy, SUV or pickup. Transfer Gearbox - an auxiliary gearbox attached to the transmission, which allows you to shift into a high and low range of 4WD for serious pulling or hauling. 4WD Maintenance Tips . 4X4s have a transfer case, locking hubs, and front and rear differentials (some have an additional center-coupling differential). The maintenance of the transfer case is the same as on a standard transmission. Therefore, when checking the fluid, you are checking for (1) proper level, (2) the presence of moisture, (3) the presence of wear particles... either in the form of metal or friction material. A small amount of wear material is acceptable. However, excessive wear material can be an indication of a problem. One of three types of lubricants is used, depending on the carmaker. These lubricants are: ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid), 30W motor oil, or 90W-gear oil. The maintenance interval (which involves changing the lubricant) for transfer cases that use ATF and 30W motor oil is every 50,000 miles. For 90W gear oil the recommended interval is 80,000 miles. In regards to the locking hubs, maintenance is extremely critical. Locking hubs come in two forms: automatic and manual. Regardless of which one you have, they must be disassembled, cleaned and lubricated every two years or 24,000 miles. Snow, ice, water, salt, and mud usually find their way into these mechanized units, rendering them useless and costing the owner big bucks! By keeping up the maintenance on them you minimize expense and downtime. With respect to differential maintenance, there's not a whole lot to do except check the fluid level every oil change and visually inspect for any leakage. The technician should check the gear lubricant for proper level, color, and consistency. Low lubricant level indicates a leak; a milky color indicates moisture in the lubricant; and the presence of metal in the lubricant indicates mechanical wear. Check your owner's manual for the recommended fluid change intervals. And check your owner's manual for specific operating instructions of your 4X4 system because the various systems function differently. There you have it, four wheeling made easy. Now go out and climb a mountain!

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- ""Che"" the movie met Che the myth in Cuba this weekend, and the lengthy biopic of the Argentinean revolutionary won acclaim from among those who know his story best. Actor Benicio Del Toro stars in ""Che,"" which details Che Guevara's role in the 1950s Cuban revolution. The movie was screened Saturday in the Yara movie theater in central Havana as part of the 30th International Festival of the New Latin American Cinema. ""Che"" also played Sunday at Havana's Karl Marx Theater. ""Che"" stars Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro in the title role, for which he won a best actor award at this year's Cannes Film Festival. But it's one thing to make a movie about Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara and the Cuban revolution and show it in France, quite another to screen it in Cuba. Speaking to CNN outside the Karl Marx Theater, the bilingual Puerto Rican actor admitted some anxiety. ""This is Cuban history, so there's an audience in there that probably, that could be the biggest critics and the most knowledgeable critics of the historical accuracy of the film,"" Del Toro said.  Watch Del Toro talk about the movie in Cuba » . It appears he needn't have worried. Audiences gave the movie hearty ovations. And Granma, the official mouthpiece of the Cuban government, gave Del Toro a glowing review. ""Del Toro personifies Che in a spectacular manner, not only his physical appearance but also his masterly interpretation,"" the state newspaper said. After the showing, Del Toro characterized the public reaction as ""sensational, a shot of adrenaline,"" Granma said. ""The dream was to make this movie and to bring it here, where it all began."" The movie has two parts: ""El argentino,"" which portrays Guevara's role in the 1950s Cuban revolution, and ""Guerrilla,"" which shows Guevara's efforts in Africa and Bolivia, where he was killed in 1967. It was directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also directed Del Toro in the 2000 film ""Traffic,"" for which Del Toro won an Oscar. At 4 hours and 17 minutes, ""Che"" can test viewers' stamina. But that wasn't a problem in Havana. It's a story Cubans know by heart. But this time, it's told by outsiders. Catalina, a history professor who would give only her first name, was a tough critic. ""The movie is well-done. It has good intentions,"" she said. ""But in my opinion, in the first part, the scenes in the jungle seemed a bit like a caricature."" Though some debated the details of this story they know so well, most -- like a young Guevara lookalike who identified himself only as Daniel -- were pleased. ""It has captured history to perfection,"" he said. ""It has been well thought out and well-created."" Others, like student Susel Paraza, were torn about seeing their history told by others. ""What hurt me a little,"" she said, ""is that it wasn't us, the Cubans, who thought to make a movie like this but instead a foreign director with foreign actors who have recreated this story very well."" Other foreign actors have played Guevara, most notably Egyptian-born Omar Sharif in a 1969 U.S. production titled ""Che!"" Soderbergh's ""Che"" has been shown at six film festivals worldwide and will have a limited opening in the United States on December 12. It is scheduled for widespread U.S. distribution starting January 24. Although many may not know Guevara's history, his image is recognized worldwide from a photograph taken by Alberto Korda at a Havana memorial service in March 1960. Titled ""Guerrillero Heroico"" (Heroic Guerrilla), the image of a somber, long-haired and bearded Guevara wearing a beret with a lone star became what the Maryland Institute College of Art called ""the most famous photograph in the world and a symbol of the 20th century."" The image has been emblazoned on everything from T-shirts to posters and even tattoos. ""There is no other image like it. What other image has been sustained in this way?"" Trisha Ziff, the curator of an exhibition on the iconography of Guevara, asked in a 2007 interview with the BBC. ""Che Guevara has become a brand. And the brand's logo is the image, which represents change. It has becomes the icon of the outside thinker, at whatever level -- whether it is anti-war, pro-green or anti-globalization."" Guevara was 31 years old when the photo was taken. He has been dead for 41 years, longer than he was alive. Jonathan Green, former longtime director of the UCR/California Museum of Photography, has been quoted as saying, ""Korda's image has worked its way into languages around the world. It has become an alpha-numeric symbol, a hieroglyph, an instant symbol. It mysteriously reappears whenever there's a conflict. There isn't anything else in history that serves in this way.""

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- Antiviolence protesters stretched out 16,000 coconuts on Brazil's world-famous Copacabana beach Saturday, each one representing a victim of urban violence. Protesters used dummies to represent victims of violence on Brazil's Copacabana beach this week. Activists from ONG Rio de Paz led a protest march Saturday morning that included residents and tourists who usually can be found on the beach on weekends. The protesters strung up a sign on the sand that said ""Shame"" in Spanish, Portuguese, English and French. They finished with a minute of silence for the victims of violence. Rio de Paz said the coconuts represent victims of violence, homicides, dead police officers and those who have been shot in gunfights between authorities and gangs of narcotics traffickers. The figure itself was obtained from official information from the Rio de Janeiro governmental Institute of Public Security. It was the second protest staged this week on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach by the group Rio de Paz. On Tuesday, the group created a mock cemetery in the sand with mannequins representing 9,000 people who Rio de Paz says have been slain and secretly buried since January 2007. Rio de Paz President Antonio Carlos Costa said he believes that about 6,000 of the missing people were killed, many by drug traffickers fighting for territory in Rio's slums and poor neighborhoods. Others, he said, were killed by hit squads and police acting on their own. ""In general, they are assassinated by police -- police acting outside of their regular work hours,"" Costa said Tuesday. ""They are also assassinated by narcotraffickers. The bodies are disposed of in secret cemeteries in the metropolitan Rio de Janeiro area or incinerated alive by narcotraffickers in what they call 'microwaves.' "" To illustrate the point, demonstrators also constructed facsimiles of the ""microwaves"" that narcotics traffickers and death squads reportedly use to cremate remains of those they have abducted.

"PARIS, France -- Argentina ended their magnificent World Cup campaign as they started it, stunning hosts France in their own back yard with a sensational performance to claim the tournament's bronze medal with a 34-10 victory. Argentina players celebrate another try on their way to a stunning 34-10 victory over France. The result, secured thanks to Pumas tries by Felipe Contepomi and Omar Hasan in the first half and Federico Martin Aramburu, Ignacio Corleto and Contepomi again in the second, brought back memories of the shock 17-12 win earned by the South Americans on the tournament's opening night. That Stade de France triumph was built around sturdy defense and although they showed the same resolve here at the Parc des Princes, their attacking edge came to the fore this time. The tries by Aramburu and Corleto were especially memorable, and helped earn the Argentinians a record success over the French. Contepomi added three conversions and a penalty to give himself a 19-point personal haul for the night, while Les Bleus could only manage a try from Clement Poitrenaud -- converted by Lionel Beauxis -- and a Jean-Baptiste Elissalde penalty. It was a disappointing way for their head coach Bernard Laporte to depart -- he takes up a post in the French government now -- but departing Pumas coach Marcelo Loffreda, who is off to Leicester Tigers, was all smiles at the final whistle. With the pressure off, the shackles were well and truly removed from the hosts, who were the more fired-up of the two sides throughout. Indeed, they bossed the majority of a fiery opening 40 minutes, but somehow found themselves 17-3 behind going into the break. Les Bleus, throwing the ball around like the country's teams of old, had a try disallowed in the 10th minute when Imanol Harinordoquy was adjudged to have passed forward prior to Elissalde touching down. The likes of Yannick Nyanga and Christophe Dominici were finding gaps in the Pumas defence but all they had to show from a dominant opening 20 minutes was an Elissalde penalty, for Patricio Albacete's hands in the ruck. Their lack of cutting edge was ruthlessly punished by Argentina, who scored two tries in four minutes around the half-hour mark. Contepomi, who had levelled matters with a 22nd-minute penalty, was the first player to go over, running onto a delayed Agustin Pichot pass to force himself over in the left corner. Then, after Juan Martin Hernandez had crashed a drop goal against the post, the Pumas retook possession and prop Hasan was there at the bottom of a pile of bodies to ground. The try needed the say-so of the video referee and Contepomi -- like he had after his own try -- added the extras for 17-3. It was a bizarre scoreline, given France's dominance of the early possession. Even when they were encamped on Argentina's line in the last five minutes of the first half, the hosts still could not break through their opponents' obdurate rearguard. Nyanga came closest to scoring in the second minute of injury time, but dropped the ball as he was attempting to ground. The half ended with Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe and Raphael Ibanez receiving yellow cards after another heated exchange, but the start of the second period was engagingly open. France needed to score first to make a game of it but they were hit by Aramburu's sucker punch in the 53rd minute. And what a try it was. Aurelien Rougerie's chip-and-chase was fielded by Felipe Contepomi before Corleto set off on a magnificent 50-yard winding run. The ball was fired out to the right -- through the hands of Manuel Contepomi and Hernandez -- to Aramburu, who jinked inside Dominici to ground. Contepomi missed the conversion but the France supporters were already whistling with their team 22-3 down. Sebastien Chabal was brought on for the final 20 minutes, and almost immediately he was floored by a late hit by Juan Manuel Leguizamon. It earned the London Irish flanker a yellow card, but Argentina made light of their numerical deficit by running in a sensational fourth try. Off turnover ball, Horacio Agulla was set clear down the left. His inside pass was taken by Corleto and just as he did in the opening game of the tournament, he scorched past the covering defense to dive over in the corner. The try France deserved came in the 69th minute, the recalled Poitrenaud easing over in the left corner following an initial Harinordoquy break. The night belonged to the Pumas, though, and Contepomi rounded things off with his second try of the night with three minutes left to add insult to injury for the French.

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's central bank introduced a $10 billion note worth less than 20 U.S. dollars, as the once-prosperous southern African nation battles against spiraling hyperinflation. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe at Zanu-PF National Political Commissar Elliot Manyika's burial last week . The new note, expected to buy just 20 loaves of bread, comes just a week after Zimbabwe issued a $500 million note to ease a cash shortage. Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor Gideon Gono said the $10 billion note was being introduced for the ""convenience of the public ahead of the festive season."" On Thursday, the U.S. dollar traded for about 600 million Zimbabwe dollars, and the hyperinflation was expected to continue. People slept overnight at the bank doors, hoping to get money for the next day. President Robert Mugabe apologized to his ZANU-PF party supporters Thursday for the problems Zimbabweans were facing but insisted his nation has turned a corner in its fight against its worst humanitarian crisis, the state-owned Herald newspaper reported. Shortages of most essentials such as electricity, fuel, medicine and food have become a common feature in Zimbabwe, forcing people to flee the country. Zimbabwe has slashed zeros from the amount of its worthless currency during the past two years -- the latest being 10 zeros in August. Once one of Africa's most promising economies, Zimbabwe is reeling under its worst humanitarian and economic crisis. A cholera outbreak has killed more than 1,000 Zimbabweans since August, forcing hundreds to cross the border into South Africa and Botswana to seek treatment. Five million people are in need of food aid in a nation that once exported food to its neighbors, the United Nations says. But Mugabe -- blamed for the crisis by his critics -- said the worst was over. He said he was optimistic about resuscitating the power-sharing deal he signed with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai in September, the Herald reported. ""We will be inviting the two leaders -- Mr. Morgan Tsvangirai and Professor Arthur Mutambara -- to come and discuss the way forward,"" Mugabe said. The deal has yet to take effect, as Tsvangirai blamed Mugabe for grabbing all key ministries such as home affairs, local government, finance, home affairs, information and defense. Mugabe said Western nations and neighboring Botswana were against the formation of an inclusive government in Zimbabwe. ""I was reading recent utterances by Condoleezza Rice that African leaders are not prepared to topple President Mugabe and bring about regime change,"" he said. ""She condemned this inability on the part of African leaders. How could African leaders ever topple Robert Mugabe, organize an army to come? It is not easy. I do not know of any African country that is brave enough to do that. ""Botswana is making some stupid noises. They are just hollow noises to assure the MDC that the Botswana government supports it and also in response to Britain and America that Botswana is a good mouthpiece of the white men."" The MDC is Tsvangirai's opposition party -- Movement for Democratic Change. On cholera, Mugabe said the country was failing to import adequate water treating chemicals because of the sanctions imposed by the west.","The new $10 billion notes comes a week after a $500 million note was issued .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The woman allegedly assaulted by singer Chris Brown in Hollywood early Sunday was his girlfriend, singer Rihanna, according to sources close to the couple. Chris Brown attends a party saluting music producer Clive Davis in Beverly Hills, California, on Saturday. While Los Angeles Police have a policy against identifying alleged domestic violence victims, two people who know both Brown and Rihanna confirmed she was the woman police said had ""suffered visible injuries and identified Brown as her attacker."" Brown, 19, turned himself in to police Sunday night after police said they were looking for him. He was arrested on suspicion of making criminal threats. Brown was later released on a $50,000 bond and given a March 5 court date. ""Detectives investigating the alleged domestic violence felony battery booked him for criminal threats,"" a statement from the Los Angeles Police Department said. ""At the time the case is presented to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, additional charges may be filed."" Brown, nominated for two Grammy Awards, was scheduled to perform at the show.  His girlfriend, singer Rihanna, abruptly canceled her planned Grammys performance, but neither her spokesman nor the show organizers gave a reason. ""Rihanna is well,"" her spokesman said in a written statement. ""Thank you for concern and support."" Watch the latest developments in the case » . Brown, 19, and Rihanna, 20, were seen together Saturday night at a pre-Grammys dinner at the Beverly Hills Hilton, about five miles from where police said the alleged incident happened at 12:30 a.m. Sunday. The police statement said Brown and a woman were in a vehicle near Hollywood's Hancock Park when ""they became involved in an argument."" ""After stopping his car, Brown and the woman got out and the argument escalated,"" police said. After receiving a 911 call at about 12:30 a.m. Sunday, officers found the woman at the scene of the alleged fight, but Brown had left, the department said. Investigators were treating the incident as a possible felony battery case, police said. Executives with Brown's record label at the Grammy Awards told CNN they knew nothing about the incident and declined further comment. Brown was nominated for two Grammys this year, including in the best male R&B vocal performance category for his song ""Take You Down."" He also shares a best pop collaboration with vocals nomination with Jordin Sparks for ""No Air."" The introduction to the CBS broadcast of the Grammys, apparently pretaped, listed both Brown and Rihanna as performers.","Brown has been arrested in connection with a domestic violence incident .

"(CNN)  -- Over 28,000 Liverpool fans marked the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in a special memorial service at Anfield on Wednesday. Liverpool supporters at the Kop end paid their respects in an emotional afternoon at Anfield. A total of 96 supporters died on April 15, 1989 before the FA Cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium, the worst-ever tragedy in English sporting history. To commemorate the anniversary, the city of Liverpool came to a standstill at 3.06 pm (1406 GMT) with the bells of the two cathedrals and its civic buildings ringing out in memory of those fans who lost their lives. On Anfield's famous Kop, 96 candles were lit while commemorations took place at Hillsborough and also in Nottingham. Members of the current Liverpool team stood somberly as hymns were played before a roll call of the dead was read out. Club legend Kenny Dalglish, who was Liverpool manager at the time of the disaster, then read a short prayer. The mayor of Liverpool, Steve Rotherham, who was at the game 20 years ago, helped organize the emotional memorial. ""Hillsborough affected so many lives, not just on Merseyside but across the whole of the UK,"" he said. ""I attended the match 20 years ago and the passing years do not diminish the importance and the poignancy of this occasion."" Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, whose 10-year-old cousin Jon-Paul Gilhooley was the youngest victim of the tragedy, spoke of his feelings this week. ""Time has gone by, but the scars will never ever be healed and the fans will never ever forget. So you can always rely on our supporters to be there for you when you need them."" The Liverpool fans died in a crush which started just before the kick-off as the gate at the Leppings Lane End was opened with terrible consequences. The match started but when the scale of the tragedy became clear, it was swiftly abandoned at 3.06 pm. In the immediate aftermath, the British government commissioned Lord Justice Taylor to conduct an inquiry which would have a far-reaching impact on football. Taylor was deeply critical of the police operation at Hillsborough, but his most significant recommendations were the removal of perimeter fencing and the creation of all-seater stadia. His report also cleared Liverpool fans of blame for the tragedy after lurid tabloid headlines provoked revulsion on Merseyside. Prime minister Gordon Brown paid reference to the controversy in an interview released on Liverpool's official television channel. ""It was wrong for people to blame, as some did, Liverpool fans on that day,"" he said. ""That's probably what matters most -- that people understood that the behavior of Liverpool fans in helping each other was magnificent. ""Let's never forget the fans who cruelly lost their lives on a day when we know the people of Liverpool were trying to help each other,"" he added. However, the people of Liverpool are still angry and bitter at the lack of justice for those who died -- and that frustration surfaced when Andy Burnham, the   Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport took to the stand to address the crowd. As Burnham spoke, the crowd rose as one to sing ""Justice for the 96"". The Kop chant boomed around the stadium and Burnham, an Everton fan, was left in no doubt about the strength of feeling over the lack of accountability from officialdom over the tragedy. Fittingly, the ceremony was concluded with Gerry Marsden leading the fans in singing Liverpool anthem 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.","A special memorial has marked the 20th anniversary of Hillsborough tragedy .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- There is an increasing threat of homegrown terror stemming from segments of a deeply isolated and alienated Somali-American community, a U.S. Senate committee hearing concluded Wednesday. Sen. Joseph Lieberman says a number of Somali-Americans support terrorist groups. The hearing, conducted by the Senate Homeland and Governmental Affairs Committee, focused on the attempted recruitment of young Somali-American men by al-Shabaab, ""a violent and brutal extremist (Somali) group"" with significant ties to al Qaeda, according to the U.S. State Department. ""Over the last two years, individuals from the Somali community in the United States, including American citizens, have left for Somalia to support and in some cases fight on behalf of al-Shabaab,"" noted the committee's chairman, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Connecticut. Al-Shabaab -- also known as the Mujahedeen Youth Movement -- was officially designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008. The hearing highlighted the case of Shirwa Ahmed, a 27-year-old Somali-American who had been radicalized by al-Shabaab in his adopted home state of Minnesota before traveling to Somalia and blowing up himself and 29 others in October. The idea that Ahmed was radicalized in the United States raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community. The incident -- the first suicide bombing by a naturalized U.S. citizen -- was the ""most significant case of homegrown American terrorism recruiting based on violent Islamist ideology,"" Lieberman said. ""The dangers brought to light by these revelations is clear: radicalized individuals trained in terrorist tactics and in possession of American passports can clearly pose a threat to the security of our country,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. Segments of the Somali-American community have been made vulnerable to recruitment by al-Shabaab because of a particularly tumultuous adjustment to American life, noted Andrew Liepman, deputy director for intelligence at the National Counterterrorism Center. ""Despite significant efforts to facilitate their settlement into American communities, many Somali immigrants face isolation,"" Liepman said. ""The (tough) adjustment to American society has reinforced their greater insularity compared to other more integrated recent immigrant communities and has aggravated the challenges of assimilation for their children,"" he said. Somalis began arriving in the United States in significant numbers following the U.S. intervention in Somalia's humanitarian crisis in 1992, Liepman said. The Somali-American population is now concentrated in clusters primarily in Minneapolis, Minnesota; Columbus, Ohio; Seattle, Washington; and San Diego, California. The potential recruitment of young Somali-American men has been made possible by ""a number of factors that come together when a dynamic, influential and extremist leader gains access to a despondent and disenfranchised group of young men,"" Liepman said. Many refugees, he said, ""lack structure and definition in their lives"" and are ""torn between their parents' traditional tribal and clan identities and the new cultures and traditions offered by American society."" Liepman pointed out that there was no evidence of a radicalization of the entire Somali-American community, now believed to number between 70,000 and 200,000 people. In fact, he said, the Somali-American community has been victimized by a ""small group of extremists who are essentially terrorizing their own community, who are recruiting and radicalizing young people within that community."" ""We don't have radicalized communities. We have radicalized clusters of (young) people,"" emphasized Philip Mudd, a director of the FBI's national security branch. The potential terrorist indoctrination and recruitment was a consequence of these clusters, Liepman said, and is the product of ""the refugee experience of fleeing a war-torn country combined with isolation, perceived discrimination, marginalization and frustrated expectations. ""Local criminal familial and clan dynamics make some members of this community more susceptible to (this) sort of extremist influence"" of groups such as al-Shabaab, he said. Liepman said there is a serious concern about individuals being indoctrinated by al Qaeda and al-Shabaab while in Somalia and then returning to the United States ""with the intention to conduct attacks.""","Committee focused on recruitment of Somali-Americans by group with al Qaeda ties .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new sleeper virus that could allow hackers to steal financial and personal information has now spread to more than eight million computers in what industry analysts say is one of the most serious infections they have ever seen. Experts say a single infected laptop could expose an entire network to the worm. The Downadup or Conficker worm exploits a bug in Microsoft Windows to infect mainly corporate networks, where -- although it has yet to cause any harm -- it potentially exposes infected PCs to hijack. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at anti-virus firm F-Secure, says while the purpose of the worm is unclear, its unique ""phone home"" design, linking back to its point of origin, means it can receive further orders to wreak havoc. He said his company had reverse-engineered its program, which they suspected of originating in Ukraine, and is using the call-back mechanism to monitor an exponential infection rate, despite Microsoft's issuing of a patch to fix the bug. ""On Tuesday there were 2.5 million, on Wednesday 3.5 million and today [Friday], eight million,"" he told CNN. ""It's getting worse, not better."" Hypponen explained to CNN the dangers that Downadup poses, who is most at risk and what can be done to stop its spread. How serious is it? It is the most serious large scale worm outbreak we have seen in recent years because of how widespread it is, but it is not very serious in terms of what it does. So far it doesn't try to steal personal information or credit card details. Who is affected? We have large infections in Europe, the United States and in Asia. It is a Windows worm and almost all the cases are corporate networks. There are very few reports of independent home computers affected. What does it do? It is a complicated worm most likely engineered by a group of people who have spent time making it very complicated to analyze and remove. The real reason why they have created it is hard to say right now, but we do know how it replicates. How does it spread? The worm does not spread over email or the Web. However if an infected laptop is connected to your corporate network, it will immediately scan the network looking for machines to infect. These will be machines that have not installed a patch from Microsoft known as MS08-067. The worm will also scan company networks trying to guess your password, trying hundreds and hundreds of common words. If it gets in, even if you are not at your machine, it will infect and begin spreading to other servers. A third method of spreading is via USB data sticks. How can I prevent it infecting my machine? The best way is to get the patch and install it company-wide. The second way is password security. Use long, difficult passwords -- particularly for administrators who cannot afford to be locked out of the machines they will have to fix. What can I do if it has already infected? Machines can be disinfected. The problem is for companies with thousands of infected machines, which can become re-infected from just one computer even as they are being cleared.","A new sleeper virus has now spread to more than eight million computers .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Three professors and a former professor at Columbia University's Teachers College received hate mail this week, the New York Police Department said. It's the campus that was shaken by several bias crimes directed at black and Jewish professors in 2007. Columbia University's Teachers College is once again the target of a hate campaign. Three professors received manila envelopes Tuesday with images of swastikas in them. The fourth, a former professor who is an African-American, was sent a manila envelope containing an image of a noose, according to NYPD deputy commissioner Paul Browne. Among those receiving a swastika image was Elizabeth Midlarsky, a Jewish psychologist who has studied psychological principles in the context of the Holocaust, police said. In 2007, her office door was spray-painted with a swastika. (A swastika is the right-angles cross symbol used on Nazi Germany flags). The NYPD Hate Crimes Unit is leading the investigation into the incident. No arrests have been made. ""The TC community deplores these hateful acts, which violate every Teachers College and societal norm,"" said an e-mail Wednesday to faculty and students from the college's president, Susan Fuhrman; and dean, Tom James. No arrests were been made in the 2007 incidents. Police declined to say if they believe there is a connection between those cases and the mailings this week.","Three professors, one former one at Columbia University receive hate mail this week .

"(CNN) -- Conservationists have found a new population of orangutans in a steep, mountainous corner of Indonesia -- a discovery that significantly adds to the number of the endangered red-haired primates. The orangutans were discovered in a mountainous corner of Indonesia. About 65,000 orangutans are thought to remain in the wild, limited to rain forests on two islands in Malaysia and Indonesia: Borneo and Sumatra. The latest population was found in the eastern edge of Borneo, with conservationists counting 219 nests. Even by conservative estimates, that raises the total number of the orangutan population by at least a couple of hundred, maybe thousands. ""We rarely have something positive to report in the conservation world. Most of the stories are about declining population or animals dying. It's all pretty negative,"" said Erik Meijaard, a senior ecologist with the U.S.-based Nature Conservancy. ""So to find a substantial population of potentially several hundred to several thousand animals is very exciting."" Locals in the area had long spoken of an orangutan population in the hard-to-access limestone mountains of the Kalimantan province. A group of conservationists reached the area in December after driving for a day, taking a boat for another, and then hiking across steep mountainous terrain for two, Meijaard said. The remoteness of the area has meant that the animals have been undisturbed by development. Elsewhere, the orangutan's forest habitat has been cut down for timber extraction and palm oil, used in food and cosmetics. Orangutans, a species of great apes, with hair that is usually reddish-brown instead of the black or brown. The name is derived from the Malay and Indonesian words for ""orang"" (person) and ""hutan"" (forest). They spend most of their time on trees, subsisting on fruit and leading a solitary existence except to mate. The expedition in December found the nests crammed into just a few miles in the 2 million-acre forest. ""The immediate steps include going back to the area to see how far the population ranges and to put better protection in place,"" Meijaard said.","Conservationists have found a new population of orangutans in Indonesia .

"A woman was jailed for eight years by a British court Friday for her part in the kidnap of her own daughter. Karen Matthews and Michael Donovan were both involved in the plot to kidnap Shannon. Nine-year-old Shannon Matthews was locked in an apartment for 24 days after going missing from her home in February last year. After a massive police investigation, Karen Matthews, 33, was found guilty last month of kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice. She was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court in West Yorkshire, northern England, the British Press Association reported. Her former partner's uncle, Michael Donovan, 40, was also convicted of the same offences and received an eight-year jail term, PA said. Prosecutors say Donovan abducted Shannon as she was on her way home from school in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. They claim he gave her Temazepam -- a type of sleeping tablet -- and travel sickness pills and kept her tethered to an elasticated strap attached to a roof beam through a loft hatch when he went out. Meanwhile Matthews kept up a ""wicked and dishonest lie"" as her daughter became the subject of a massive police search operation and a reward fund offered by a local newspaper grew to $50,000, jurors were told. Donovan planned to release Shannon and then ""discover"" her, prosecutors said. According to PA, Matthews told five versions of what happened to Shannon, ranging from being a distraught mother whose daughter had gone missing to blaming the crime on her former partner Craig Meehan and other members of his family. It also emerged in court that Donovan abducted one of his own daughters after he became involved in a custody battle with his former wife, PA said.","Girl, 9, drugged, tethered, as part of kidnap plot staged by mother and uncle .

Craig Rutman poses poolside with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir before a 1997 show in Reno, Nevada. ""I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls,"" muses Mark Goldfarb of Woodstock, New York, quoting the Grateful Dead song, ""Scarlet Begonias."" On a fateful day 28 years ago, Goldfarb began a shaggy odyssey of love at a Grateful Dead concert when he literally bumped into his future wife, Diane. Over the years, he has been to more than 125 Grateful Dead concerts. The band literally changed his life. Goldfarb, who now makes moccasins for a living, is excited about the Grateful Dead's new tour. The surviving members of the band will be reuniting for 19 shows this year. He went to see them during their last organized tour five years ago. ""What was special about the Dead is you had a group of highly talented musicians who were able to get a sense of the audience,"" Goldfarb said. ""When the audience was off, the band would be off. There was a lot of back-and-forth energy."" Back in the late '70s and well into the '80s, Goldfarb traveled the West Coast in a Volkswagen van playing music for a belly-dancing troupe at Renaissance festivals. Along the way, he went to Grateful Dead concerts whenever he could. He sent a photo of his now short-haired self to show the ""then and now"" contrast. Though he lives now in Woodstock, New York, he missed the two large music festivals in his town. A businessman now, Goldfarb says he feels he's grown up in a lot of ways.

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN)  -- Daniel Rendon Herrera, Colombia's most-wanted drug kingpin suspect, was arrested early Wednesday, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe announced at a news conference. Police escort suspected drug kingpin Daniel Rendon Herrera, left, on Wednesday in Bogota, Colombia. The government had offered $2.1 million, or 5 billion pesos, for information that would lead to the arrest of Rendon, also known as Don Mario. Officials said Wednesday that they will determine how that reward will be paid. Rendon, who was captured in the Uraba region of northwestern Colombia, was transferred to the capital, Bogota, on Wednesday afternoon. A live TV broadcast of his arrival at the Military Airport of Catam, on the outskirts of Bogota, showed a somber-looking Rendon being led off an airplane to a police van. Rendon was wearing a two-toned, gray and blue shirt and gray pants, and his hands were bound in front of him with white plastic cuffs. The arrival was broadcast on CNN affiliate Caracol TV. Uribe, whose news conference also was televised, said he learned of the arrest while meeting in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The Colombian president called Rendon ""one of the most feared narcotraffickers and criminals in the world."" The president's Web site also carried news of the arrest. The United States had issued an extradition order for Rendon, whom 300 members of an elite police unit captured. Thirty members of Rendon's gang were arrested with him, El Tiempo newspaper said on its Web site. Authorities had been concentrating on Rendon's capture for the past nine months and moved undercover operatives into the area where he was hiding on April 6, Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos said. Authorities nearly captured Rendon twice in the past few months, but he escaped, Santos said at the military airport. The suspect was found in the jungle, where he had been hiding for two days. ""He was virtually like a dog,"" Santos said. Telephone intercepts, human intelligence and cooperation from the United States were crucial in Rendon's capture, El Tiempo newspaper said. Santos also issued a message Wednesday to a cartel suspect he identified only as ""El Cuchillo,"" the Knife. ""My message is that he give up, because he is next,"" Santos said. ""We are getting close."" Rendon is the brother of the imprisoned Freddy Rendon Herrera, known as ""El Aleman"" (the German) for the efficiency with which he ran his drug operation.","NEW: Suspect had been hiding in jungle for two days, defense chief says .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A grand jury Tuesday indicted three New York police officers on charges related to the alleged sodomy of a man on a Brooklyn subway platform in October. Michael Mineo says New York Police officers sodomized him inside a Brooklyn subway station. The indictments came after two other officers told the grand jury they saw Officer Richard Kern assault 24-year-old Michael Mineo with a police baton in October, authorities said. ""I think that both officers who stepped forward acted in a responsible, if not a heroic, way,"" Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said Tuesday. ""I think both of them deserve a great deal of praise for doing that."" Kern, 25, faces charges including aggravated sexual abuse, a felony that could put him in prison for up to 25 years if convicted. Officers Andrew Morales and Alex Cruz, both 26, face charges including hindering prosecution. Both are accused of trying to cover up the incident by falsifying records. All three pleaded not guilty Tuesday at their arraignment before Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge John Walsh. Authorities say Kern and Morales approached Mineo, a Brooklyn tattoo artist, on October 15 after seeing him walking down a street smoking what they believed to be marijuana. As the uniformed officers approached Mineo, he fled. The officers chased him into a Brooklyn subway station, where they apprehended him on the platform, authorities said. Cruz and a transit policeman, Kevin Maloney, joined the other officers and helped to subdue Mineo, who was then handcuffed with his hands behind his back, according to authorities. Mineo claims Kern used his retractable police baton to sexually assault him on the subway platform. Witnesses said they heard Mineo's cries. Mineo's lawyers said he showed officers he was bleeding, but they provided no medical attention and didn't call a supervisor as Mineo requested. Kern gave Mineo a summons for disorderly conduct, and Mineo was released, authorities said. Mineo sought treatment at an area hospital, and hospital staff notified police that they treated a patient who claimed to be a victim of police brutality. Hynes said that based on forensic information gathered by a medical examiner and the police lab, there was enough evidence to move the case to a grand jury. The grand jury started hearing testimony October 28. Maloney and another officer testified that they had seen Kern assault Mineo with his baton. After Tuesday's arraignment, Kern was released on $15,000 bail; the other two officers were released on their own recognizance. Cruz's defense attorney called the case ""paper thin."" Kern's attorney said Mineo's accusations were motivated by money, saying Mineo is planning to file a civil suit. Mineo's attorneys would not explain why their client ran from police. The attorneys said they plan to file a civil suit, but they did not give information on the damages they plan to seek. Mineo said he still suffers the effects of the attack.

"(CNN) -- My eyes stung, I was coughing, my nose was running. Along with cameraman David Hawley and freelance producer Kareem Khadder, I had just been tear-gassed -- not for the first time last Friday -- during a day-long clash between Palestinian kids and Israeli soldiers in the West Bank town of Na'alin, on the West Bank. An Israeli soldier confronts Palestinian protesters during a demonstration Friday in the West Bank village of Jayyus. We had gone there to gauge the Palestinian view of Tuesday's Israeli elections. Na'alin, and many other towns and villages like it in the West Bank, are in the forefront of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Here, it all comes down to the most basic element in the century-old conflict: control of the land. Na'alin is an old town, with factories and workshops, surrounded by olive groves. But in recent years neighboring Israeli settlements, built since the June 1967 war, have increasingly encroached on Na'alin's farmland, and Israel, on grounds of security, has built its security barrier around the town. As a result, Na'alin residents say they have lost access to much of their land, their water sources, in short their livelihood. Beginning two years ago, every Friday they hold protests against Israel's settlement expansion and barrier building. Most Na'alin residents are not ideological hotheads; before the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, in September 2000, many worked in Israel. Most are still fluent in Hebrew and do business with Israelis looking for a good deal on car repairs and other services. For that reason I thought Na'alin would be a good place to see what Palestinians were thinking. What I heard was universal pessimism. No one I spoke with expressed the slightest hope that any of the leading candidates --Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu, Kadima's Tzipi Livni, Israel Beitenu's Avigdor Lieberman and Labour's Ehud Barak -- would do anything to remove the settlements that are slowly closing in on Na'alin. As we sheltered from the tear gas behind a house, Na'alin resident Hani Khawaja told me, ""I don't expect anything to come out of the elections that will please the Palestinians. Just killings, expulsions and land confiscations."" Another man, Ayub Srour, had a slightly different approach. He prefers Israeli leaders to be honest about their intentions, and not raise hopes only to dash them later. He wants Likud leader and long-time hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu to win. ""At least he's honest. He says he'll expel us, and he will expel us. He says he's slaughter us, and he will slaughter us."" I've covered almost every Israeli election since 1996. With each election, the Palestinian feeling of despair and hopelessness only deepens. Since the last election in the spring of 2006, Palestinians have seen Israel and Hezbollah go to war, West Bank settlements continue to expand, Hamas and Fatah fight it out in Gaza with Hamas taking control in June 2007. They've also seen a series of Israeli incursions into Gaza, culminating recently in the 22-day Israeli offensive that left large parts of the strip in ruins. Meanwhile many Palestinians say their leadership -- often described as moderate and pro-western -- in Ramallah is incapable of reversing the trend of settlement expansion. The same leadership has been unable to convince Israel to remove few of the hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints that make travelling around the West Bank a test of patience and endurance. In short, when Palestinians look back over the last 15 years since the Oslo Accords were signed, they've seen their lot only go from bad to worse. As a result, more and more Palestinians are convinced the only way to beat the Israelis is to join them, to discard failed attempts at creating a Palestinian state in an ever smaller, ever more economically unviable territory, and go for what is known as the one-state solution. That would mean Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza relinquishing their dream of an independent Palestinian state, and instead insisting on equal rights in the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean, an area that is, for all intents and purposes, under Israel's control anyway. The one-state solution is an anathema to many Israelis, who are well aware that, with their higher birth-rate, Palestinians (those living within Israel proper, plus Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza) could well become a majority within a generation. Israelis increasingly worry the national struggle between Israel and the Palestinians will be transformed into an internal struggle, for equal rights for all those living within historic Palestine. Those fears prompted Israel's current caretaker prime minister, Ehud Olmert, to warn as far back as November 2007 that if Israel doesn't move quickly to achieve a two-state solution, it will be in a position not unlike South Africa during the apartheid area, whereby a minority -- in this case Israeli Jews -- rules over a restive majority -- the Palestinians -- by means of force, repression and discriminatory laws. Many Palestinians argue that is already the case, citing Israeli restrictions on movement, residence, and work. The bedrock of Israeli antipathy toward the Palestinians is part of the reason for the growing strength of the Israel Beiteinu (Israel is Our Home) Party, led by Avigdor Leiberman. He argues that Israel's Palestinian minority (they make up about 20 percent of the population) as a potential fifth column working against the aims of the Jewish majority. Leiberman has focused much of his fire on Palestinian Knesset members such as Ahmed Tibi, accusing him and others of sympathising with Israel's enemies, Hamas and Hizballah. His solution is to compel all of Knesset members -- and possibly all Israeli citizens -- to take an oath of loyalty to the state. Another of Leiberman's proposals is to redraw Israel's boundaries to exclude as many of its Palestinians as possible. Tibi responds that Leiberman's growing clout is symptomatic of ""an obvious fascist phenomena invading Israeli society. During the last years, racism became mainstream."" Back in the town of Na'alin, the kids throwing stones at Israeli troops do have some odd companions. Young Israelis, some of them self-described anarchists, also take part in the protests. They don't throw stones, but they do offer useful advice. ""Laththam! Laththam!"" one Israeli with black tattoos on his arms tells a young boy, no older than 12, hurling rocks with a home-made sling. ""Laththam"" is Arabic for ""cover your face,"" the advice imparted because if Israeli troops can identify stone throwers, they arrest them. There still is cooperation of sorts between Palestinians and Israelis, but it's an increasingly rare commodity. And this election probably won't do anything to bridge the growing gap between the two -- the curious friendship in Na'alin notwithstanding.","CNN correspondent finds moods of universal pessimism in West Bank town .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former CIA station chief in Algeria is under investigation by the State and Justice departments after being accused of raping at least two women while he held the post, a source confirmed to CNN on Wednesday. Two Algerian women allege that the CIA's former Algeria station chief raped them at his home, a source says. The women told investigators that they think date-rape drugs were used in the assaults, which are said to have occurred at the officer's official residence, according to the source. The story was first reported by ABC News. The allegations were made in the fall, when the unidentified officer was still serving as station chief. In October, soon after the allegations were made, the man returned to the United States for a previously scheduled trip and was ordered not to return to his post, the source said. A senior U.S. official confirmed that the case is under investigation but refused to comment on the details. State Department spokesman Robert Wood issued a brief statement in response to a CNN inquiry, saying that ""the individual in question has returned to Washington and the U.S. government is looking into the matter,"" and referring reporters to the Justice Department. The women, who are Algerian citizens, brought their allegations to a U.S. government official, and federal authorities then launched an investigation. A search of the station chief's residence in Algeria was approved by a U.S. District Court judge after a request from the Justice Department. The search found pills believed to be of a type commonly used in date rape, the source said. In that search, authorities also found about a dozen tapes that are thought to show the officer engaged in sexual acts, the source said, including some in which women are believed to be in a semiconscious state. CNN's source had not seen the tapes but had been briefed on their content. Some of the tapes include date stamps indicating that the recordings happened when he would have been serving in Cairo, Egypt, before his tenure in Algeria. The investigation includes his time in both posts as well as other locations where he traveled. The identity of the officer could not be learned, and CNN was unable to reach a representative of the officer. It is against the law to reveal identities of covert officers. When the allegations surfaced in the fall, they were viewed as ""tremendously explosive, no doubt about that,"" the source said, especially because Algeria is a Muslim country. The Justice Department and the CIA would not comment on the allegations or any investigation. ""I can assure you that the agency would take seriously and follow up any allegations of impropriety,"" CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said. The officer has not been charged, the source said. The source would not speak for attribution because the investigation is ongoing and the source was not authorized to speak publicly. One federal law enforcement source said that no developments or activities relating to the case are ""imminent."" A station chief heads the CIA's office in a foreign country, establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities in the country. CNN producers Jim Barnett, Pam Benson, Carol Cratty and Elise Labott contributed to this story.","Source: Two Algerian woman say CIA officer raped them in Algeria .

"(CNN) -- Key structural changes have been identified in the brain images of some patients with mild cognitive impairment which could help determine who's at greatest risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, studied MRI scans of 84 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 175 patients with mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, and 139 images of healthy brains. ""Our initial goal was to locate similarities in the patients with Alzheimer's disease to those with MCI, in the hopes of finding a method to predict [MCI patients'] likelihood of developing the disease,"" said lead study author Linda McEvoy, assistant project scientist at UCSD's department of radiology. Neuroimaging results for the patients with Alzheimer's disease were as expected, according to the study, which was published online in the journal Radiology. Atrophy, which is loss of brain tissue, was visible throughout the brain. The temporal and parietal lobes, which affect cognitive function, saw the most damage. What surprised researchers were the differences in images from the MCI patients. More than 50 percent of the brains in the MCI group showed atrophy similar to the Alzheimer's disease patients. The other half of the MCI patients showed only small amounts of tissue damage.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain the findings » . ""Although the symptoms for the entire MCI group were primarily memory problems, other parts of the brain were impacted in over half the group,"" McEvoy said. ""And even though these patients [with Alzheimer's-like atrophy] don't have problems with their cognitive function now, their MCI will likely develop to that in the future."" Researchers also evaluated the brains of the MCI group one year after initial testing. They found that patients who earlier had mild cognitive impairment plus signs of atrophy were getting worse. Twenty-nine percent of the group had since been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the others had begun to show signs of more serious cognitive decline. The condition of patients in the MCI group whose scans showed minimal signs of atrophy the previous year remained about the same. ""Only 8 percent of this group had developed Alzheimer's disease. The rest of the patients were stable and their symptoms had not increased,"" McEvoy said. Bill Thies, chief medical and scientific officer for the Alzheimer's Association, underscored the significance of these findings. ""What this study really shows is how different people with MCI can be, despite having similar symptoms. We can now use this information to create new treatments,"" he said. There are several drugs on the market that treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, but none that prevent its progression. Clinical trials may be able to use this data to select a better pool of candidates when testing new drugs. ""If they use a MCI patient with loss of brain tissue, someone who we now know is progressing fast towards Alzheimer's disease, we'd be able to quickly figure out if drug 'X' is slowing things down or not helping at all,"" Thies added. In addition, researchers hope that within the next few years patients could regularly be tested by their physicians to determine their risk of developing  Alzheimer's. ""If nothing else it would be good information for their family members to have early on, to be better prepared for the future."" McEvoy said. Over 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease and an estimated three and a half million have mild cognitive impairment.","Key structural changes seen in brain scans of some patients with memory loss .

"Editor's note: Clark Howard, the Atlanta, Georgia-based host of a nationally syndicated radio show, is host of a television show designed to help viewers save more, spend less and avoid getting ripped off during these tough economic times. The show airs at noon and 4 p.m. ET Saturdays and Sundays on HLN. Clark Howard says use the Internet to hook up with powerful networking groups. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Many years ago, I had the opportunity to start an Atlanta-based civic program called Career Action. The program's goal was to provide free resources to help the jobless and underemployed find steady work. That was 1979. Today, it's 2009 and the need for job assistance is greater than ever as unemployment continues to rise. The conventional wisdom about education and employment -- that as your level of education rises, the less likely you are to be impacted by layoffs -- has been completely flipped on its head. This recession knows no boundaries in terms of education, skill level, training or years on the job. So, what do you do if you're laid off or have your hours cut at work? First, don't panic! You're going to need to apply for unemployment insurance. I'm hearing a lot of people badmouthing unemployment compensation. There's nothing shameful about it. Employers pay premiums over time during the good years to provide for those who get laid off in lean times. It's not beneath you to accept this insurance money. Next, you need to triage your finances so you know which debts to prioritize and which to neglect if your money runs out. Paying your car note is central to finding employment for most people. It's practically higher than paying your mortgage or rent. In fact, you may need to live with friends or relatives until you can get back on your feet. What shouldn't you prioritize paying? Your credit cards. People say, ""But that will hurt my credit..."" Look, if you're in a situation where there's no money coming in and you have to decide between paying the mortgage and putting food on the table, chances are your credit is already damaged. Once you get organized financially, it's time to job hunt. Looking for work is a full-time job and you need an action plan. Start by reviewing your list of contacts, but understand that people don't like to be called and asked if there's a job. But they do love to give advice that may lead to a job opportunity. Visit in person with your contacts if possible. I'm also a big believer in networking groups and unemployment support groups. Networking for jobs has become something of a lost art in our country because people think the Internet replaces everything else. It doesn't. However, there are ways to use the Internet to hook up with powerful networking groups. There's even a new organization called LaidOffCamp that is like a free day camp for the underemployed. According to the movement's Web site, it's ""an ad-hoc gathering of unemployed and nontraditionally employed people (including freelancers, entrepreneurs and startups) who want to share ideas and learn from each other."" You never know whom you might meet. When you are job hunting on the Internet, be sure to check out screen-scraper sites like SimplyHired and Indeed.com. They're both ""one-stop shops"" that collect content from all the traditional job sites such as Monster and Yahoo! HotJobs, plus the career pages of individual company sites. In addition, The Boston Globe recently recommended several specialty sites when you're looking for work in a specific field. BioSpace.com is geared toward the science and biotechnology fields; Idealist.org focuses on the nonprofit charity world; and for those who are 50 years or older, there's a site called WorkForce50.com. In the course of your job search, you may find that you need money immediately and can't sit around waiting for a job offer to materialize. In that case, certain skill sets -- Web design, programming, marketing and videography, to name a few -- lend themselves to consulting work or freelancing on a project. The Internet also offers a variety of sites that match freelancers up with employers. A recent article in The San Francisco Chronicle suggested ELance.com, oDesk.com, Guru.com and crowdSPRING.com as starting points. And if you can afford it after all of your necessities, it's always a great idea to keep your mind sharp by taking classes to improve your skills or learn new ones. You can never be too smart.","Clark says you're going to need to apply for unemployment insurance .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The pilot who landed a crippled US Airways jetliner on the Hudson River thought there would have been ""catastrophic consequences"" if he tried to make it to a nearby airport, a National Transportation Safety Board official said Saturday night. US Airways Flight 1549 remained in the icy Hudson River on Saturday. Instead, pilot Pilot C.B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger decided to ditch the plane in the Hudson River close to vessels moving about the water ""to improve chances of recovery,"" NTSB board member Kitty Higgins said. It was the first time the public heard comments from Sullenberger and first officer Jeffrey B. Skiles describing Thursday's emergency landing. Skiles was flying US Airways Flight 1549, bound for Charlotte, North Carolina, when he noticed a flock of birds less than 90 seconds after the plane had taken off from New York's LaGuardia International Airport, Higgins said. In an instant, the plane was rocked by loud thuds and both engines went out, Higgins said.  Watch the plane hit the water » . ""He commented on the formation, and he said the next thing he knew, the windscreen was filled with birds. There was no time to take evasive action,"" Higgins said. Sullenberger took control of the aircraft while Skiles began complicated procedures to try to restart the engines, Higgins said. Sullenberger thought the plane was moving ""too low, too slow"" to risk returning to LaGuardia through the maze of buildings. Nor did Sullenberger think the powerless aircraft could make it over the densely populated New Jersey area to Teterboro, Higgins said. ""There could be catastrophic consequences if we didn't make it,"" she quoted Sullenberger as saying.  Watch CNN's Lisa Sylvester report on the pilots » . City officials, passengers and aviation experts have lauded Sullenberger and the flight crew for their handling of the landing and also praised first responders who acted quickly to minimize passengers' injuries in below-freezing temperatures. All 155 people on board the plane survived. ""These are both very experienced pilots. They knew what they had to do,"" Higgins said. Neither Sullenberger nor Skiles attended the news conference. Earlier in the day, the NTSB revealed the content of communications between the cockpit and controllers at LaGuardia in the brief period during which the incident unfolded. ""This is cactus 1549, hit birds, we lost thrust in both engines,"" Sullenberger told controllers at approximately 3:27 p.m. Thursday. ""We're turning back towards LaGuardia."" Controllers immediately began preparations to clear a runway for an emergency landing, but less than a minute later, Sullenberger reported that the aircraft wouldn't make it, Higgins said. The last communication from the plane to controllers, Higgins said, was the pilot saying, ""We're gonna be in the Hudson.""  Watch a former pilot tell how to water-land a plane » . Higgins also quoted two of the flight's attendants, who were in jump seats at the front of the aircraft when they heard a loud thud shortly after takeoff. ""It was a sound that neither one of them had ever heard before,"" Higgins said. ""They said all the engine noise ceased. They described it as complete silence, like a library."" Efforts to raise the jetliner from the river proved successful late Saturday, as cranes lifted it clear of the water about 11:30 p.m. ET following several hours of work by crews in frigid conditions. Video from the scene showed the right side of the aircraft with the engine intact but its covering mangled. It was not clear visually whether the damage was from an in-flight incident or from the landing impact. Investigators planned to tow the plane on a barge to an undisclosed location for their examination.  Watch water wash over the plane » . Searchers using sonar think they have found the left engine on the river bottom. Divers will try to confirm the finding, Higgins said.  Watch workers begin the retrieval process » . The flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- both crucial to determining exactly what happened Thursday -- remained on the aircraft, which was still largely submerged in the Hudson River but was secured to moorings. Strong currents and cold water thwarted divers' efforts to retrieve the recorders from the tail section of the jetliner, Higgins said. Also Saturday, authorities released audio and transcripts of two 911 calls from people who said they saw that the plane was in trouble.  Listen to callers report plane in the river » . One caller said he saw the plane descend and reported hearing a loud noise shortly after the aircraft took off. ""Oh, my God! It was a big plane, I heard a big boom just now. We looked up, and the plane came straight over us, and it was turning. Oh, my God!"" a man calling from the Bronx told a 911 operator at 3:29 p.m., three minutes after the plane left LaGuardia. Minutes later, at 3:33 p.m., a woman called 911 and reported seeing the plane in the water. ""A plane has just crashed into the Hudson River,"" she told an operator. ""A US Air big DC-9 or -10 has crashed into the Hudson River. ... Oh, my gosh!""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Singer Chris Brown, sought by Los Angeles police after an alleged domestic violence incident, turned himself in Sunday, police said. Chris Brown attends a party saluting music producer Clive Davis in Beverly Hills, California, on Saturday. Brown, nominated for two Grammy Awards, was a no-show Sunday night at the nationally televised awards show. He was scheduled to perform at the show.  His girlfriend, singer Rihanna, abruptly canceled her planned Grammys performance, but neither her spokesman nor the show organizers gave a reason. ""Rihanna is well,"" her spokesman said in a written statement. ""Thank you for concern and support."" Police have not identified the alleged victim, who they said ""suffered visible injuries and identified Brown as her attacker."" Brown, 19, and Rihanna, 20, were seen together Saturday night at a pre-Grammys dinner at the Beverly Hills Hilton, about five miles from where police said the alleged incident happened at 12:30 a.m. Sunday. The police statement said Brown and a woman were in a vehicle near Hollywood's Hancock Park when ""they became involved in an argument."" ""After stopping his car, Brown and the woman got out and the argument escalated,"" police said. After receiving a 911 call at about 12:30 a.m. Sunday, officers found the woman at the scene of the alleged fight, but Brown had left, the department said. Investigators were treating the incident as a possible felony battery case, police said. Executives with Brown's record label at the Grammy Awards told CNN they knew nothing about the incident and declined further comment. Brown was nominated for two Grammys this year, including in the best male R&B vocal performance category for his song ""Take You Down.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ariel Binns is cute, smart, outgoing and looks remarkably like first daughter Sasha Obama. Young model Ariel Binns, right, resembles Sasha Obama. The similarity has not gone unnoticed by the fashion industry. Harper's Bazaar magazine cast the 6-year-old Brooklyn, New York, first-grader with model Tyra Banks in a photo spread showing an African-American family in the White House. Binns, a child model, was peering out from under a big wooden desk in an image reminiscent of John F. Kennedy's time in office. When it comes to fashion there's nothing like a powerful brand to boost sales, especially if that brand is a dynamic first family. ""Marketers are finally waking up to it -- you know -- black is beautiful,"" says global branding expert David Rogers who predicts African-American models will play a more prominent role in fashion photography as a direct result of the Obamas. ""It's just going to become part of the fabric of the fashion imagery of pop culture, which is a great thing,"" says Rogers.  Watch young first daughter look-alike model » . At Wilhelmina Kids, a modeling agency in New York for kids and teens, agents say there is increased demand for first daughter look-alikes. ""It's a trend because, what little girl doesn't want to emulate the first kids?"" said Marlene Wallach, president of Wilhelmina, which represents Binns. Unlike the Bush twins or Chelsea Clinton, global branding experts say the appeal of the Obama girls is unique -- and infinitely marketable. After the first kids appeared in their J.Crew outfits on Inauguration Day, the company's Web site got so many hits, it crashed. ""The most visible, most exciting family in America is this beautiful black family and so people are ready and looking for those kinds of images,"" says branding expert David Rogers, adding that a lot of Americans want to identify and, ""find some sort of connection with this family."" There is a downside. The Obamas were not happy when toy manufacturer Ty Inc. came out with African-American dolls named Sweet Sasha and Marvelous Malia even though the company said the dolls did not look like the Obama girls. First lady Michelle Obama's office said it was ""inappropriate to use young private citizens for marketing purposes."" New York  clinical psychologist Judy Kuriansky says many famous families face similar problems. ""I can certainly understand Michelle Obama being protective of her children. Many celebrities in Hollywood feel that way too. They don't want their children exposed to the public, because once the child is exposed to the public image, not only are they owned, but they could be used in many different ways and it takes away from the child growing up as a normal, average child."" Still, some say the celebrity of Sasha and Malia has a positive effect by presenting a positive and prominent image of young African-American girls. Asked whether she believes the Obama girls will open up possibilities for her own child, Ariel Binns' mom Dawn Crooks says, ""I think it will. I hope it does."" As for the overall effect, branding expert Rogers says he believes using look-alikes will take diversity to a whole new level.","One young model is getting jobs because she looks like an Obama daughter .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Pope Benedict XVI will not visit Israel's Holocaust museum when he makes his first trip to the region as pope in May, though he will visit a memorial that is part of the site, his ambassador to Israel said Tuesday. Pope Benedict XVI, shown at the Vatican during a prayer Sunday, has spoken out forcefully against the Holocaust. He will also become the first pontiff to visit the Dome of the Rock, one of the holiest sites in Islam, said the envoy, papal nuncio Antonio Franco. Foreign heads of state normally visit the Holocaust museum, which is part of the Yad Vashem complex in Jerusalem. But it includes controversial wording describing the role of Pope Pius XII during World War II, which is why Pope Benedict balked, an Israeli official said. Critics have accused Pope Pius of doing too little to prevent the mass murder of European Jews by the Nazis under Adolf Hitler. A caption in the museum says he maintained a neutral position during the years of mass extermination of Europe's Jews. The Vatican defends him and is gradually opening its archives in an effort to show that he acted behind the scenes. Franco gave the news of Pope Benedict's visit to Yad Vashem at a news conference in Jerusalem. Pope John Paul II also did not visit the museum section on his historic pilgrimage to Israel in 2000, Father Federico Lombardi, a papal spokesman, said as he confirmed that Pope Benedict will not do so. An official with Israel's Foreign Ministry said the decision was made jointly because of the sensitivity of the matter. Yigal Palmor conceded that there is an argument over the wartime pope's actions during the Holocaust and noted that the museum has a sign stating that the facts are in dispute. He said that Pope Benedict may visit other parts of the Yad Vashem complex, which is divided into several compounds, and that the pontiff will lay a wreath at the site's Hall of Remembrance, which is part of the protocol for visiting heads of state. The announcement that Pope Benedict will visit only part of Yad Vashem also follows international outrage over his rehabilitation of a rebel bishop who denied the Nazis systematically murdered 6 million Jews in the Holocaust. The Vatican ordered the bishop, Richard Williamson, to recant, and said the pope was not aware of Williamson's views on the Holocaust when he lifted the excommunication of the bishop. Pope Benedict, who was born in Germany and forced to join the Hitler Youth as a teenager, has spoken out forcefully against the Holocaust on a number of occasions, including on a visit to the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Pope Benedict will make his pilgrimage to the Holy Land May 8-15 with stops in Amman, Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth, according to the itinerary released by the Vatican. He will be celebrating Mass in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth, the city where Christians believe Jesus preached and lived. Some 50,000 pilgrims are expected to attend that event, the bishop of Nazareth said. In Jerusalem, a city holy to all three of the major monotheistic faiths, Pope Benedict will visit the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest prayer site, and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which Catholics believe is the site of the crucifixion, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The pope will also meet Israel's chief rabbis and enter the Dome of the Rock with the chief Muslim cleric in the Holy Land, the grand mufti of Jerusalem. He will also meet Jordan's King Abdullah and Israeli President Shimon Peres, as well as Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, Franco said. CNN's Guy Azriel in Jerusalem and Alessandro Gentile in Rome contributed to this report.","NEW: Benedict XVI to be first pontiff to visit the Dome of the Rock .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Five people got the lavish ride of a lifetime as the only passengers on a transatlantic flight, causing environmental groups to criticize the major carrier for leaving a wasteful carbon footprint. American Airlines has faced criticism for a transatlantic flight carrying only five passengers. Using about 68,000 liters (15,000 imperial gallons) -- or 13,000 liters per passenger -- of jet fuel for the nine-hour trip from Chicago to London, American Airlines is being accused of unnecessary waste. Each passenger left a footprint of 35.77 tons of carbon dioxide, enough to drive an average car 160,000 kilometers (100,000 miles). ""Flying virtually empty planes is an obscene waste of fuel. Through no fault of their own, each passenger's carbon footprint for this flight is about 45 times what it would have been if the plane had been full,"" Friends of the Earth's transport campaigner Richard Dyer said. Because of a mechanical malfunction, AA flight 90 was 14 hours late leaving Chicago's O'Hare airport on February 8. Though most passengers made other arrangements to London, five lucky passengers unable to be rebooked made the 6,400 kilometer (4,000 mile) flight in business class, with two crew members per passenger. American Airlines said it chose to continue with the flight because of the full load of passengers waiting at London's Heathrow airport to return to the United States. ""With such a small passenger load we did consider whether we could cancel the flight and re-accommodate the five remaining passengers on other flights,"" says American Airlines' European spokesperson Anneliese Morris. ""However, this would have left a plane load of west-bound passengers stranded in London Heathrow who were due to fly to the U.S. on the same aircraft."" Morris was quick to point out that despite the staggeringly low passenger count, the flight did carry a full cargo load. ""We sought alternative flights for the west-bound passengers but heavy loads out of London meant that this was not possible. The only option was to operate the flight,"" Morris said. ""This put the aircraft in London Heathrow for the following day, enabling us to operate a full schedule and avoid further inconvenience to our passengers and cargo customers."" Environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth say that international governments should hold the aviation industry accountable for the amount of CO2 they produce each year, and point to instances like this to show that airlines should pay a fuel tax to rein them in. ""Governments must stop granting the aviation industry the unfair privileges that allow this to happen by taxing aviation fuel and including emissions from aviation in international agreements to tackle climate change,"" Dyer said. But despite these accusations, Kieran Daly, air transport intelligence editor for Flight International magazine, said the amount passengers carried was irrelevant. ""Airlines are still a business. The cargo had to be flown and perhaps some of it was time-sensitive,"" Daly said. ""It's just not practical for an airline to tell its customers that it won't fly until it has a full passenger load. Customers won't be happy and the airline will quickly be out of business."" E-mail to a friend .","Environmental groups angry with American Airlines after five-passenger flight .

"(CNN)  -- An apparent natural gas explosion in downtown Bozeman, Montana, leveled three businesses Thursday morning, according to city and state officials. An explosion rocks downtown Bozeman, Montana, on Thursday in a photo from iReporter Sean Gallik. ""When we say gone, we mean gone. These three businesses are gone,"" said Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, who added that the state is providing help for clean up, and to businesses and residents who are affected. One person remained unaccounted for Thursday evening, Bozeman Assistant City Manager Chuck Winn said. ""The situation remains unsafe for anyone to enter,"" Winn said. ""So in terms of a search -- we are unable to do so at this time."" Winn said city crews are making progress cleaning up the area, but the damage is great. He said a meeting was planned Friday morning to give business owners and residents information about when they can return. ""It literally looks like a bomb went off in downtown Bozeman,"" he said. iReport.com: Photos from the scene . ""Roofing material, construction material is scattered for three or four blocks,"" he said. ""It was a very violent explosion."" Schweitzer added that the situation would ""not be over in 24 hours."" The blast occurred about 8:15 a.m. on the town's Main Street, Fire Chief Jason Shrauger told CNN. The city government declared a local emergency after the blast. Initially, 11 people were reported missing, but 10 were later accounted for, Winn said. It was not clear what triggered the blast.

"(CNN) -- Evander Holyfield failed in his bid to become the oldest heavyweight champion when he lost on points to giant Russian Nikolai Valuev in Zurich, Switzerland on Saturday. Holyfield struggles to escape the reach of seven-foot Russian world champion Valuez in Zurich. One judge scored the bout a draw while the others had Valuev winning 115-114 and 116-112 thus denying 46-year-old Holyfield the heavyweight title for the fifth time. American Holyfield will take time to consider whether to return to the ring after his defeat. ""I will go home and think about the future,"" he said. ""But I knew I could still do it. ""I fought very well and won the fight but I did not get the decision. I think I showed tonight that I still can box and that age does not matter."" Valuev said it was an honor to fight a legend like Holyfield. ""I am proud to have been in the same ring with him,"" he said. ""He was very fast and hard to hit. I can only advise people not to get hit by him. I expected a tough fight and that is what it was. Holyfield is a great fighter and he proved it tonight."" With Valuev controlling the centre of the ring in the opening rounds, Holyfield danced around his opponent, hitting with occasional single shots. He did well to stay away from Valuev´s long left jab and hit him with a big left in the fourth, but the Russian answered with a strong right uppercut. Much to the delight of the crowd, the fifth was a good round for Holyfield who first landed a right-left combination to the body and later connected with a big left hook to the head. Both men were on target during a mid-round exchange in the sixth, but Valuev´s left jab looked more effective. In the seventh, the crowd raised the roof when Holyfield fired in a combination to the head. Valuev´s corner urged him to be more aggressive and he eventually landed a strong right in the eighth when Holyfield seemed to tire a little. The seven foot Russian remained on the front foot as there was a big exchange during the ninth, and in the 10th Holyfield landed a strong right-left combination. Valuev finished better and pushed his opponent in the corner in the 12th . After the final bell, both men hugged each other, with either fighter claiming the win. When the scorecards were read, boos rang out as the crowd favorite's narrow defeat was confirmed.","Evander Holyfield failed in bid to become oldest heavyweight champion .

"(CNN)  -- Wimbledon have confirmed plans to hold an exhibition event on Centre Court to test conditions under the new roof ahead of next year's tennis championships. Wimbledon first unveiled plans for a retractable roof over Centre Court in 2004 with capacity increased to 15,000. The special one-off event has been scheduled for Sunday, May 17, just over a month ahead of next year's Championships where Rafael Nadal defends the title for the first time. Former British number one Tim Henman, four times a semifinalist at the grass-court grand slam and a member of the All England Club, has been lined up to play. The club's chief executive, Ian Ritchie, explained the need for a pre-tournament event: . ""The key thing for the new roof is the atmospherics and humidity conditions, "" he told BBC Radio Four on Tuesday. ""We need to get 15,000 people inside to test the humidity. It's a roof over a grass court and it's not like a football or rugby pitch, we need it to be absolutely bone dry. ""We have to test the air conditioning and playing surface as well."" Former champion John McEnroe is also being lined up to make a sentimental return to Centre Court. ""We are looking to put together a good raft of people to come and play. ""We will probably put several matches on as we want to put on a day of entertainment and enjoyment to try to get a maximum crowd to come and see it,"" said Ritchie. Wimbledon first announced plans for a retractable roof over Centre Court in 2004, with the redevelopment increasing the capacity to 15,000. It will mean an end, on Centre Court at least, to the famous Wimbledon rain delays, which have frustrated spectators and players alike over the years, arguably costing Henman his best chance of Wimbledon glory in 2001 when he lost a protracted semifinal to eventual winner Goran Ivanisevic.","Wimbledon to test new roof over Centre Court with special event in May .

"LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- His job was to drive the bus. But Meher Mohammad Khalil is now being hailed as a lifesaver. On Wednesday Meher Mohammad Khalil went back to the place where gunmen attacked his bus. When gunmen jumped out of bushes and began spraying bullets at the bus carrying the Sri Lankan cricket team Tuesday, Khalil quickly sized up his options and got everyone to safety. ""First I thought there were some firecrackers going off. Then, when I saw the elite force cars in front of me taking fire, I immediately lost my voice,"" Khalil told CNN on Wednesday. ""At that time, the other elite car that was with us gave me cover, and then, when I saw he was giving me cover, my courage and my patience returned.  Watch CNN's interview with Khalil » . ""I decided to take the vehicle from there, and one way or another, even if I had to drive over someone, I would take this bus and escape.""  Watch the gunmen attack » . Khalil returned to the scene of the attack in the Pakistani city of Lahore on Wednesday to honor those who were killed and to place flowers in their memory. One of the dead was Zafar Khan, a friend and fellow bus driver who had been in a vehicle behind Khalil. ""My eyes filled with tears that these were people that I was eating with and who died in doing their duty."" Khalil had been part of a convoy heading to Gaddafi Stadium, where the Sri Lankan cricket team was to continue a match against Pakistan. Six police officers were killed, in addition to Khalil's friend Khan who was driving a bus with the match umpires.  See where the attack happened » . The Sri Lankan cricketers praised Khalil's quick thinking and action, saying he saved their lives. Six team members were injured by broken glass and shrapnel. Team captain Mahela Jayawardene wrote on his Web site of Khalil: ""He probably saved our lives, showing remarkable bravery in the face of direct gunfire to keep the bus moving."" Crowds mobbed Khalil as he paid his respects at the place where his life changed in an instant. ""He is a hero, a real hero, a real man of the people,"" a man in the crowd said. Private donors in Lahore have rewarded Khalil with 300,000 rupees (more than $3,000) -- a small fortune for a Pakistani bus driver. Today, Khalil says all he can feel is pain of the loss of life. And he called on the attackers to recognize that their victims are humans just like them, with mothers and sisters. ""For God's sake, please stop this terrorism and let this nation breathe a sigh of relief,"" he said.

"ATHENS, Greece (CNN) -- Thousands of youths demonstrated in central Athens Friday as anger flared in the Greek capital following the shooting of another teenager. High school students protest in front of their school in the western Athens suburb of Peristeri. A group of youths targeted the French Institute, a language and cultural institute, and police scrambled to the scene to contain the incident. The situation began heating up during a protest rally Thursday that followed the bizarre shooting of a high school student in an Athens suburb earlier this week. The 17-year-old was hit in the hand by an unknown assailant as he was talking to a group of schoolmates in the western suburb of Peristeri. Initial police reports showed the student -- the son of a leading trade unionist -- was hit with a .38-caliber handgun. Police said no officers were patrolling the region at the time of the incident. The mysterious shooting has enflamed widespread student anger over the fatal police shooting of a 15-year-old boy December 6, which sparked Greece's worst riots in decades.  Watch more about the flare-up of protests » . Students rallied Friday in response to the shooting of the 17-year-old. One of the rallies was planned for central Athens; the other in the suburb where the student was shot. Later in the day, scores of artists are scheduled to gather in central Athens to stage a protest concert in response to the initial shooting of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos. Daily protests since the December 6 shooting, including riots, have thrown Greece into turmoil and have become a simmering anger about the conservative government's handling of the economy, education, and jobs. A string of labor unions called on workers to march on Parliament Friday to protest the voting of the 2009 state budget, which calls for additional belt-tightening measures in response to the global financial crisis. Student unions were also gathering to across the country to determine their course of action for the next few weeks. At least 800 high schools and 200 universities remain shut as thousands of youths have seized the grounds and campuses in protest. The unrest is threatening the government's hold on power, with some opposition groups calling for fresh elections. Stores and international businesses have been attacked, and at least 280 people have been detained by police. Of that total, 176 were arrested, 130 of them for looting. Of the two officers involved in the death of the 15-year-old, one is charged with premeditated manslaughter and the other with acting as an accomplice.","17-year-old shot by unknown assailant in Athens suburb of Peristeri .

"TAIJI, Japan (CNN) -- Mention a dolphin to someone in the United States and they'll think about a trip to Sea World or the 1960s-era TV program ""Flipper."" Residents in Taiji, Japan, have been hunting dolphins for hundreds of years. Talk about a dolphin in rural Japan and some people think of dinner. Fishermen hunt dolphins about every day in Taiji, a town of about 3,000 in southwestern Japan that juts into the Pacific Ocean. Locals know they offend Western sensibilities by eating dolphins, but they say it's a tradition hundreds of years old. And they say outsiders have no more right to tell them to stop eating dolphins than they would have to demand that Westerners stop slaughtering, say, chickens or cows.  Watch fishermen catch dolphins » . ""I know there are many different ways of thinking in different societies, but for us who've been eating this for a long time ... it's an awkward thing to be criticized for,"" says Kayoko Tanaka, a retired middle school teacher. ""I either fry dolphin meat or turn it into a stew."" That disgusts Ric O'Barry, a 68-year-old retired dolphin trainer from Miami who makes a second home in Taiji, where he goes to unusual lengths to fight against the tide of local tradition. O'Barry sometimes dresses as a woman or wears a large surgical mask to disguise his Western identity on trips to spots overlooking the ocean. He prowls the cliffs with a video camera, hoping to catch fishermen in the act with footage that could stir emotions and raise awareness in the West. ""This here is ground zero for the largest slaughter of dolphins on planet Earth,"" says O'Barry, who trained five dolphins to play ""Flipper"" on the TV series of that name. ""It's absolutely barbaric and it needs to stop."" He says the dolphins face a cruel fate. ""It takes a very long time to die. They bleed to death. And some of them are dragged in the boats with hooks while they're still alive,"" he says. ""Many of them are gutted while they're still alive."" Looming beyond questions of whether the slaughter is humane, however, are larger and more complex questions of culture and perspective. To some puzzled people in rural Japan, the question comes down to this: What's the difference between killing and eating a dolphin and killing and eating a fish? Or a chicken? Or a cow? Most Japanese do not eat dolphins -- it's common in a few small fishing villages -- but the government respects the rights of people in towns like Taiji, says Joji Morishita, the international negotiator for Japan's Fisheries Agency. Many Japanese consider the deer a sacred messenger from the gods, he says, but they would never suggest that people in other parts of the world stop venturing into the woods on a quest for venison, Morishita says. ""We don't like to play God to say this animal is just for food and this is not,"" he says. ""Because we know nation to nation we have totally different ideas."" That's obvious in the growing clash between Australia and Japan over whale hunting. Japanese ships crisscross the Antarctic Ocean each winter to capture and kill up to 1,000 whales. Whaling is allowed under international law when done for scientific reasons, which Japan cites as the legal basis for its hunts. Legal justifications aside, however, the whale hunts offend many people in Australia, where new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has turned up the political pressure on Japan. His government has dispatched a customs ship to monitor and videotape the whalers. And Rudd says Australia could even file charges against Japan in an international court to try to stop the whaling. Back in Taiji, the fishermen are well aware of the Western sentiment that motivates whaling opponents. They realize the danger to their way of life that can come with prying cameras from other countries. When CNN trained its cameras on fishermen gutting some freshly killed dolphins, the fishermen erected some tarps to obstruct the view. Representatives of the Taiji Fishermen's Union declined CNN requests for an on-camera interview. So did the town's mayor and several others. And O'Barry says he's gotten into a few shouting matches with fishermen, who resent him and his camera. So what does O'Barry say to their claim that he has no right to tell them to abandon a tradition that has flourished in their small corner of the world for more than 400 years? ""If someone came to my hometown and told me what to do, what to eat, I'd be outraged,"" he says. ""But that's not going to stop me from doing it. I mean, tradition? It used to be traditional for women not to vote. So do we keep that going because it's traditional and cultural? Of course not."" Complicating the debate are findings suggesting that eating dolphins may not be good for one's health. The Japanese government said in 2005 that bottlenose dolphin meat contains 12 times more mercury than blue fin tuna -- high levels of mercury in fish can cause health problems in pregnant women and young children. A city councilman in Taiji, Junichiro Yamashita, grew so concerned about mercury levels that he persuaded locals schools to stop serving dolphin meat at lunch. He even plucked some of his hair, sent it off for testing and discovered that it contained seven times as much mercury as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers safe. The mercury findings have not swayed Masaru Matsushita, a Taiji fish dealer. He says that dolphin activists like O'Barry only see their needs without understanding the culture in his town. ""I understand that they think the dolphin in a cute animal, and I agree they're cute doing performances,"" he says, ""but it is our culture to eat dolphins.""

"(CNN) -- Italian newspapers, an archbishop and civil liberties campaigners expressed shock and revulsion on Monday after photographs were published of sunbathers apparently enjoying a day at the beach just meters from where the bodies of two drowned Roma girls were laid out on the sand. Photographs of the dead Roma girls on a beach caused outrage in Italy. Italian news agency ANSA reported that the incident had occurred on Saturday at the beach of Torregaveta, west of Naples, southern Italy, where the two girls had earlier been swimming in the sea with two other Roma girls. Reports said they had gone to the beach to beg and sell trinkets. Local news reports said the four girls found themselves in trouble amid fierce waves and strong currents. Emergency services responded 10 minutes after a distress call was made from the beach and two lifeguards attended the girls upon hearing their screams. Two of them were pulled to safety but rescuers failed to reach the other two in time to save them.  Watch why the photos have generated anger » . The Web site of the Archbishop of Naples said the girls were cousins named Violetta and Cristina, aged 12 and 13. Their bodies were eventually laid out on the sand under beach towels to await collection by police. Photographs show sunbathers in bikinis and swimming trunks sitting close to where the girls' feet can be seen poking out from under the towels concealing their bodies. A photographer who took photos at the scene told CNN the mood among sunbathers had been one of indifference. Other photos show police officers lifting the bodies into coffins and carrying them away past bathers reclined on sun loungers. ""While the lifeless bodies of the girls were still on the sand, there were those who carried on sunbathing or having lunch just a few meters away,"" Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported. Corriere della Sera said that a crowd of curious onlookers that had formed around the bodies quickly dispersed. ""Few left the beach or abandoned their sunbathing. When the police from the mortuary arrived an hour later with coffins, the two girls were carried away between bathers stretched out in the sun."" The incident also attracted condemnation from the Archbishop of Naples, Cardinal Crecenzio Seppe. ""Indifference is not an emotion for human beings,"" Seppe wrote in his parish blog. ""To turn the other way or to mind your own business can sometimes be more devastating than the events that occur."" Recent weeks have seen heightened tensions between Italian authorities and the country's Roma minority amid a crackdown by Silvo Berlusconi's government targeting illegal immigrants and talk by government officials of a ""Roma emergency"" that has seen the 150,000-strong migrant group blamed for rising street crime. That has provided justification for police raids on Roma camps and controversial government plans to fingerprint all Roma -- an act condemned by the European Parliament and United Nations officials as a clear act of racial discrimination. Popular resentment against Romanies has also seen Roma camps near Naples attacked and set on fire with petrol bombs by local residents. In a statement published on its Web site, the Italian civil liberties group EveryOne said Saturday's drowning had occurred in an atmosphere of ""racism and horror"" and cast doubt on the reported version of events, suggesting that it appeared unusual for the four girls to wade into the sea, apparently casting modesty aside and despite being unable to swim. ""The most shocking aspect of all this is the attitude of the people on the beach,"" the statement said. ""No one appears the slightest upset at the sight and presence of the children's dead bodies on the beach: they carry on swimming, sunbathing, sipping soft drinks and chatting."" CNN's Jennifer Eccleston contributed to this report.","Italian outrage over photos of sunbathers at a beach where two Roma girls drowned .

"(CNN) -- A Florida company is suspending launch of its ""Caylee Sunshine"" doll following a public outcry that included members of slain toddler Caylee Anthony's family. The ""Caylee Sunshine"" doll would have cost $29.99 but sales of the doll have been suspended. Jaime Salcedo, president of Showbiz Promotions, told CNN that the Jacksonville-based company intended for the dolls to honor children who die young and raise money for charity. But on Tuesday the company announced on its Web site that it is suspending the promotion. The dolls were scheduled to go on sale at noon Tuesday for $29.99, according to the company's Web site. The dolls have blond hair, rather than Caylee's brown hair, and wear jeans and a T-shirt that says ""Caylee Sunshine."" According to the Web site, each doll plays the song ""You are My Sunshine."" ""However, after reviewing the response to our media introduction of the Sunshine Caylee Doll and listening to the advice of the general public, we feel that it is best to suspend the launch,"" said a statement on the Web site -- called the ""Caylee Anthony Tribute Site"" -- signed by Salcedo. ""While we still feel it is important to raise awareness and raise money to help stop this type of crime from being committed, we feel we can be more effective using traditional methods,"" the statement said.  Watch Nancy Grace grill Salcedo » . Caylee was 2 when she was last seen in June. Her skeletal remains were found last month in woods about a half-mile from her grandparents' home. Her mother, Casey Anthony, 22, faces charges including first-degree murder in her death. ""Holding a Caylee Sunshine Doll can help us remember that all the children taken from this world prematurely are dancing, playing and singing their sunshine song forever,"" the Web site says. Brad Conway, attorney for the girl's grandparents, George and Cindy Anthony, told the Orlando Sentinel on Monday, ""This is an example of another person trying to profit from the tragedy of Caylee's death. ""He has never met my clients, spoken to my clients and has not gotten authority of any type to do this,"" Conway said. ""And after I have a chance to research it, I will likely take whatever legal action I can."" Salcedo appeared Monday night on ""Nancy Grace"" on CNN's sister network HLN to defend the doll. The criticism, he said, was ""not something that we did not expect. We actually have been over it several times ... and for that exact purpose, we did not create the Caylee Sunshine Doll in the likeness of Caylee Anthony. We thought that that would be way off base in this,"" he said. ""The fact that you gave the little doll blond hair, how does that somehow remove the sleaze from this whole thing?"" Grace asked. Showbiz Promotions said on the site  http://www.cayleedoll.com/ that 100 percent of its profits would be given to charity. Salcedo told Grace that ""a portion of the sales are going to charity."" He would not be more specific, however, saying he did not know how much would be donated because none have been sold. Salcedo also refused to name the charity that would receive the money. ""We contacted a few of the biggest organizations in the world, and especially in the United States,"" he told Grace. ""They don't want to partner up because it's -- it's a policy that they have to follow. They cannot get themselves involved with a case that they're handling."" Pressed on the issue, he said he had contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, but ""their answer was real simple. They don't speak about Caylee Anthony on their Web site. It's not that it's good or bad. They can't do it. They don't raise funds using the name of any children or any situation that they're following. So it was difficult for us. That is the organization that we want to give to."" A disclaimer on the site says, ""The Inspirational Caylee Doll is being used to bring awareness to missing and exploited children around the world. Any similarities or likeness to Caylee Anthony are false ... CayleeDoll.com is not affiliated with Caylee Anthony, her relatives or the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, nor do we make any claim thereof."" The ""comments"" portion of the Web site mainly contains posts from people saying they are disappointed the doll was suspended. ""Thank you for making this doll and bringing awareness to the situation because Caylee is not the only child that has fallen victim to this type of crime, and it's heartbreaking that people ignore it and just turn away,"" one post said. But another post said, ""I want to thank you for not proceeding with the making of this doll. I understand your point and what you were trying to do. I just think that making a doll based on a child's death is too painful for the public."" ""This is just one more atrocity,"" said a posting on the Orlando Sentinel Web site. ""I have no doubt there have been so many people other than myself who literally began to cry when they ran the video of Caylee singing that song just days before she was killed. Thank goodness the public spoke out loudly enough to stop this."" Caylee Sunshine T-shirts ($12.99) and bracelets and stickers ($3 each) are still offered for sale on at www.cayleedoll.com. Showbiz Promotions' Internet sales are the subject of an investigation by the Florida attorney general's office, according to the office's Web site. Consumers allege they ordered and paid for merchandise from the company's Web sites, including www.vickdogchewtoy.com and www.wheresmyplea.com, but did not receive the items, the office said. The first Web site offers a dog chew toy in the likeness of Michael Vick, the former Atlanta Falcons quarterback who is imprisoned on charges related to dog fighting, for $7.77.

"(CNN) -- Paul O'Neill, who was appointed treasury secretary in 2001 by President Bush, says the federal government is not doing enough to fix the U.S. financial system. Former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill says he's hoping for a ""V-shaped"" recession. O'Neill appeared on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" on Sunday to talk about his outlook on the recession and what the Treasury Department should demand of major financial institutions in order to get the U.S. economy back on track. Following is an edited transcript of their conversation. Fareed Zakaria: Looking at the current economic crisis, do you think there is any prospect of what people call a ""V-shaped recession,"" that is, a quick recovery? Or are we in for a long, perhaps years of sluggish growth, what economists call an ""L-shaped recession""? Paul O'Neill: You know, I've got to tell you, I'm praying for a V- shape. But I'm one who doesn't believe we're going to start moving back up until there is a credible fix for our financial system. And I think, in spite of all of the things that have been done now by the federal government, we're not quite there. If I were secretary, I would do this. I would order the 19 major financial institutions to put on the Internet the classifications of their assets by investment grade rating, beginning with AAAs down through BBB-minuses, which is the final level of investment grade ratings. And for those parts of their asset holdings that can't be rated investment grade -- or, in fact, as they say, can't be valued or can't be fairly valued -- I would create a new device which I call a ""quarantine account."" One could make a judgment about the value of these institutions, and the institutions could make a self-judgment, about how much more lending capacity they had, if the quarantined assets are set aside.  Watch O'Neill offer his advice to Obama administration » . Zakaria: The basic idea -- the basic proposal you're making is transparency. Let everyone understand what's on the banks' books. O'Neill: Right. Zakaria: Isn't that a lot like Tim Geithner's stress test? O'Neill: Well, I don't think so. Let me ask you a question. How do you think it's possible to do a so-called ""stress test,"" if 30 or 40 percent of the assets in the institution can't be valued? Here's another plea I have: If you can't value the assets, please don't buy them with my money. Zakaria: You mean the government shouldn't be buying these toxic -- these assets. So you think the Treasury Department's proposals so far are all wrong. I mean, it sounds like you think they're doing all of the wrong things. O'Neill: Well, you know, excuse me, but I'm not one who cares much for the notion of separating the idea of the government as some disembodied entity that has a life independent of me. The money that they're committing and spending is at least in part mine. I'm a substantial taxpayer, and I don't want my representative to buy assets with my money that I wouldn't buy. Why would I want to do that, Fareed? Why should we want them to do that? Zakaria: But this is a pretty frontal assault then on the Treasury's bank plan so far. O'Neill: Well, you know, I don't mean to be offensive to this administration or the last one, but it seems to me, if you're an intelligent investor, you invest in things where there is truth and transparency. And you have a shot, if you're a good leader, at earning the cost of capital and maybe even something more. And I think that basic principle ought to apply to how our government thinks about what it's doing in the name of ""we, the people."" You know, I really don't like this idea that somehow the government can do things that intelligent people wouldn't do, and we don't notice. Zakaria: One of the other things the government is doing is running up large deficits. There's this large fiscal expansion. Now, you were opposed to the Bush tax cuts, because of your concern about what they would do to the deficit. At that time, the deficit projection was $500 billion, and to you that seemed just too much. The deficit projections now are going to be in the $1.75 trillion range. There are many people who say, you know what, this is that once-in-a-75-year moment where the government has to spend money because nobody else is spending money. Do you buy that? O'Neill: I think, honestly, I'm not so much worried about the stimulus and its components as I am about what I consider to be an essential job -- to get a floor under the financial system, so that we can go back to economic growth in this country and around the world, because there is no hope until we do that. There's not enough ink in the printing presses at the Federal Reserve to print enough money to fill the void created by the absence of real economic growth in our society and around the world. Zakaria: When you were treasury secretary, you were famously suspicious of the financial sector. I mean, you thought there was a little too much attention being paid to it. You looked around at all those Bloomberg screens in the Treasury Department and said, you know, what do these guys make? In a way, reflecting your background in Alcoa. Do you look at this unraveling and feel like the financial sector and the financial system got overweight and fat? I mean, what happened here? O'Neill: We had a whole lot of people who were the public face of all of this financial activity that got ever more exotic. And I think, in truth, very few of them understood the detailed business activity that was going on underneath them. They were all kind of floating up here in the ether. And I think it's true, if you listen to the commentary, even today, what some of these people are saying, they had no idea what was going on. It just felt really good, and it seemed like they were making a lot of money. Zakaria: And do you think that, on the bank issue, are you hopeful that Geithner may, when he unveils the plan, have some of the components that you're suggesting? Or is it your sense they're just headed in the wrong direction? O'Neill: You know, show us the money. Let us see for ourselves. If I was buying a company, I would not put up with someone else giving me a certification that the assets were worth something. I'd go and look in the boiler room and find out if there's rust on the valves. You know, we're talking about providing the wherewithal for intelligent investors to make decisions that they can rely on the facts. And I think the administration hasn't gotten to the point yet of insisting that the big 19 financial institutions put their facts on the table, and for that matter, a place like General Electric put all of its facts on the table, so investors can make an informed decision. I've said this to some people, and they've said -- some of them have said, ""We'd be happy to do that, and we would be OK with that."" Some other major financial institutions have said, ""Oh, my God, if we did that, people would see how bad it really is."" I think knowing how bad it really is, is the only way we're going to create a foundation for going forward, Fareed.","U.S. should demand major financial institutions come clean, ex-Treasury chief says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Bucking tradition, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will bypass Europe and travel to Asia on her maiden voyage overseas, diplomats familiar with the planning said Tuesday. Bill Clinton looks at his wife Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as she is sworn in on February 2. Clinton is expected to visit China, Japan and South Korea on her first trip overseas. The diplomats said she may also add other stops, including one in Southeast Asia. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because Clinton's schedule was still being finalized. The State Department has not commented on her travel plans. Making Asia Clinton's first overseas destination illustrates the Obama administration's desire for a broader partnership with China and its commitment to resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, as well as strengthening ties with Tokyo and Seoul, the diplomats said. The White House said President Barack Obama told Chinese President Hu Jintao in a Friday phone call that he looked forward to ""to early contacts and exchanges between senior officials of our two countries."" Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month she hoped to make an early trip to Southeast Asia, in particular Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation where Obama spent part of his childhood. Clinton said she wanted to restart Peace Corps programs there, which were suspended in the 1960s. Traditionally U.S. secretaries of state make Europe or the Middle East their first official trip overseas. But given that Vice President Joseph Biden is headed to Europe this week for a security conference in Germany, and special envoy George Mitchell is currently in the Middle East, Clinton is free to break with tradition. However British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and German Foreign Secretary Walter Steinmeier will be Clinton's first foreign guests to the State Department on Tuesday. Clinton was sworn in as America's 67th secretary of state on Monday -- for a second time.  Watch Clinton being sworn in » . Biden administered the oath to Clinton in a ceremonial star-studded gathering at the State Department, with actor Chevy Chase and designer Oscar de la Renta among those on hand.

"(CNN) -- You may have noticed: Clint Eastwood has become respectable in his old age. ""Gran Torino,"" says Tom Charity, is all about Clint Eastwood. And that's a great thing. To judge by the release pattern and some of the more reverent reviews, you would think the 78-year-old director's second movie of the season (after ""Changeling"") was another prestige picture with Oscar firmly in its sights, along the lines of ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Letters from Iwo Jima."" Nominations may be forthcoming, or they may not (we'll find out January 22), but trust me, ""Gran Torino"" is not that kind of animal. It's a crude but pungent stab at popular filmmaking, blue-collar and bare-knuckle. Which is not to say it's disappointing. On the contrary, it's an entertaining star vehicle that does its job well. Other films around right now tackle ""important"" themes -- the Holocaust, justice, alienation -- but ""Gran Torino"" is all about Clint: the suspicious squint, granite composure and bad-ass attitude. Is Eastwood important? If you have grown up with this enduring American icon, there's no question about it. Apparently Nick Schenk's screenplay wasn't written specifically for him, but after seeing the film it's impossible to imagine it with anyone else. Eastwood's Walt Kowalski is a Korean War veteran and retired auto worker, a grumpy old man and the last white guy holding on to his property in an inner-city neighborhood that's been taken over by Asian-Americans. The movie opens at his wife's funeral. (How many times have we seen Eastwood with a wife on screen? Not too often.) Walt's not happy, of course, but more than anything, he seems pissed off. His kids are a sore disappointment. The grandkids merit nothing more than a growl. At the wake, even the priest, Father Janovich (freckle-faced Christopher Carley), is quickly shown the door. Walt is alone now, and he means to keep it that way. He sits on a deck chair out on his front porch, a cooler of beer beside him, the American flag hanging limp over his square patch of lawn. It's a portrait of implacable American isolationism -- until the teenage son of his Hmong next-door neighbor encroaches on Walt's turf. Thao (Bee Vang) nearly gets his head blown off trying to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino. To apologize, and to thank the white guy for stepping in to save him from the gangbangers who put him up to the stunt, Thao reluctantly reports for a week of whatever chores Walt might ask of him. The grudging mutual respect that develops between them is entirely predictable, but in Eastwood's clean, unfussy but discreetly patient direction, even a banal task -- like wrestling an old fridge out of the basement -- assumes the bonding power Alan Ladd and Van Heflin found in digging out a stubborn tree stump in ""Shane."" Like other Eastwood heroes before him, Walt sacrifices his independence by accepting that others depend on him. The relationship is also laced with plenty of gruff humor. If you're feeling indulgent, the film has almost as many laughs as a comedy. The older man introduces Thao to his barber (John Carroll Lynch) for a lesson in guy talk -- which turns out to be the art of barking invective with impunity. (PC, it's not.) Meanwhile, Walt's own racist (Archie) Bunker mentality thaws when Thao's self-assured sister Sue (Ahney Her) introduces him to the pleasures of Thai food. All the while, the neighborhood punks hover in the background, waiting for the right moment to test whether Dirty Old Harry is firing anything more than blanks these days. Schenk's screenplay isn't subtle, and some of the young cast struggle to camouflage its crudeness, but Eastwood revels in the pragmatic design and roughneck humor of the piece. Walt may be a dinosaur, but he carries a big footprint. In a similar way, ""Gran Torino"" is no classic, but at least it's a star vehicle worthy of a true legend. ""Gran Torino"" is rated R and runs 116 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.","""Gran Torino"" is vintage Eastwood, right down to the attitude .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- More than 100 people were killed and several dozen wounded when an overturned petrol tanker exploded in Kenya early Sunday, authorities said. The blast is the second multi-fatality incident in the east African country in four days. A supermarket fire in Nairobi on Wednesday killed at least 27 people, with another 57 still missing. The tanker explosion occurred near Molo, a small town in the Rift Valley Province -- about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the capital, a spokesman for the Kenyan police said. The tanker overturned along a highway spilling gallons of gas which hundreds of residents rushed to scoop up, said Titus Mung'ou of the Kenyan Red Cross. ""People were lining up trying to get the fuel,"" he said. ""They were siphoning off petrol for over an hour. Some people had drilled holes in the tanker and were charging a fee for the assembled crowd."" The vehicle exploded about an hour later, apparently after one of the residents lit a cigarette or started a fire at the crash site, Mung'ou said. Four policemen, who were trying to control the crowd, were believed to be among the victims, Mung'ou said. Another 117 people were wounded in the blast, police said. The figures are expected to rise, officials said. The Red Cross sent more than 80 people to help with rescue efforts. Those who were seriously wounded were flown to a hospital in Nairobi. Meanwhile, the death toll from last week's Nairobi supermarket fire rose to 27 on Sunday, the Red Cross said. Rescue workers found the latest victims as they searched through the rubble of the scorched structure in downtown Nairobi. The fire ignited Wednesday afternoon during a somewhat busy hour in the 24-hour Nakumatt supermarket. Police launched a criminal investigation to look into allegations that security guards locked people into the burning building. Employees of the supermarket refused to comment on the allegations. The fire angered Kenyans for what they perceived as a lack of disaster preparedness. Emergency numbers failed to work and water ran out during attempts to put out the fire, said Mung'ou of the Kenyan Red Cross. ""There is the need to strengthen the capacity in handling fires,"" Mung'ou said.","Tanker explosion occurred near Molo, a small town in the Rift Valley Province .

"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- A 13-year-old Chinese girl tried to commit suicide because she wanted her family to donate her liver to her cancer-stricken father, state media reported Thursday. The girl, Chen Jin, swallowed more than 200 sleeping pills after she discovered a medical note in her mother's purse that said her father was dying of liver cancer and had three months left to live, the news agency Xinhua said. Jin's mother returned home after visiting her husband in the hospital to find the front door locked. The mother climbed in through a back window and found two empty bottles of sleeping pills. ""Mom, I'm sorry I couldn't stay with you any longer,"" read a note that the teen had left next to her. ""Please give my liver to dad and save him after my death."" The incident occurred January 24 in Jiangsu province in east China. The teen was taken to the same hospital as her father, where she remains in intensive care, drifting in and out of consciousness, Xinhua said. Doctors say that even if she pulls through, she will need surgery for burns she suffered from an electric blanket on her bed when she lost consciousness, the China Daily newspaper said. According to Chinese media reports, the family -- whose monthly income is about 1,000 yuan ($146) -- has already spent nearly 100,000 yuan ($14,600) in medical expenses since the father was diagnosed with cancer more than a month ago. The mother, who is also in poor health, retired early more than eight years ago. The woman told China Daily she is now trying to keep her husband from learning of their daughter's desperate act of love.","A 13-year-old Chinese girl tried to commit suicide to save her cancer-stricken father .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Barack Obama's inauguration marks a profound manifestation of the Rev. Martin Luther King's dream, civil rights leaders say, but the movement would be foolish to drop its guard now. Christine King Farris sits next to a photo of her brother as she reads to kids to commemorate his birthday Thursday. King did not fight tirelessly and ultimately give his life so African-Americans could take office; he fought for the disenfranchised and downtrodden, no matter their color, said Charles Steele, president and CEO of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King and Steele's father helped found. ""President-elect Barack Obama is just a piece of the puzzle,"" he said. ""This tells us that we are at a station, but it's not our destination. We've got to get back on the train."" Steele said he worries that those who espouse King's dream may grow lackadaisical because an African-American has taken the reins of the free world. But it is imperative, he said, that they ""march now more than ever before."" Steele points to 1963, when tens of thousands of protesters converged on Washington to demand equal rights. It was there King delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech from the Lincoln Memorial steps. President Kennedy's administration was considered the most receptive ever to the concerns of the civil rights movement, Steele said. But rather than sit back and hope Kennedy did the right thing, King and thousands stormed Washington to lay out demands that later would yield the Civil Rights Act and National Voting Rights Act. Those down for the cause today must do the same with Obama, Steele said. ""Back in the '60s we were fighting for President-elect Barack Obama; we just didn't know it was him,"" Steele said. ""It was civil rights, not politics, that got us to this position, and we can't forget that."" Andrew Young remembers pickets outside City Hall the day he took office as Atlanta's second black mayor in 1982. Young, a former King lieutenant, said he was initially confused when he noticed some of the protesters were his supporters. ""I said, 'I haven't changed.' They said, 'Yes, you have. You're in charge,' "" recalled Young, who also has been a U.S. congressman and U.N. ambassador. ""They were there reminding me I was the man."" Obama, too, needs to be reminded of the concerns of the African-American community, Young said, warning civil rights supporters not to assume Obama owes them something. ""He is one of the fruits of our labors,"" Young said, ""and all he has to do is plant more seeds and grow more trees that bear more fruit."" Young's words rang true with Kee-Shawn Smith, 19, a sophomore at the historically black Clark Atlanta University. She said King and Obama have ""set the way"" for African-Americans and it's time to concentrate on race, the human one. ""America gives you that one thing -- opportunity,"" she said. ""A lot of African-Americans have to realize we have the same opportunities as any other race, any other culture. ... People should take strides to do better than [Obama]."" Neither Obama's election nor the King holiday represent that ""we just want African-Americans to have this. It's more a global perspective,"" said Jeffrey Harrell, 20, a junior at Morehouse College, another historically black school. ""It's about everybody."" Today, there are still immigrants and women fighting for rights, there are people who are hungry and others without homes, Harrell said. ""Until everyone is able to take part in what's called the American dream, the struggle's not done,"" he said. Harrell also said he was struck by the timing of the inauguration, which falls the day after the King holiday, and he wasn't alone in his belief that it was more than coincidental. ""It shows it's supposed to be this way,"" he said. His words struck a theme, as poet and author Maya Angelou called the timing ""amazing"" and said it was as if ""someone in the outer sphere"" planned it. The Rev. Joseph Lowery, a close friend of King's who will deliver the benediction at Obama's inauguration, said the timing of the two events ""reflects the mysticism of the movement.""  Details: Is it coincidence or ""divine order""? » . Young chuckled upon hearing Lowery's words relayed and added, ""I always say that coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous. ... I can't think of a nicer birthday present for Martin Luther King."" King's only living sibling, Christine King Farris, told CNN that she, too, felt the timing was ""in divine order.""  Watch Christine King Farris talk about her brother, Obama » . King Farris spent part of Thursday morning, her brother's birthday, reading to children at the national park bearing his namesake. She read tales about the shenanigans of a mischievous young King and his brother, Alfred Daniel -- M.L. and A.D. -- who once conspired to get out of music practice by loosening a leg on the piano stool. The prank sent the piano instructor crashing to the floor, King Farris recounted, to the giggles of elementary and preschool students. But she also spoke of her brother's prophecy when he once told their mother, ""One day, I'm going to turn this world upside down."" Farris said afterward it's important that children understand that though King is portrayed as larger than life, he was once a child like them. It's a necessary lesson in a nation that has struggled with the concept of ""equitable opportunity."" ""It's going to take some time because it deals with attitudes and, really, the upbringing of children and young people to understand that although we are different in color, in hue and so forth, we are still together. We should be like brothers and sisters,"" she said. Setting aside race and working together is paramount to the success of Obama's presidency, Angelou said, and with each day it grows more vital. ""We needed President-elect Obama desperately, and he needs us,"" she said. ""We need to be up and doing. ... What he needs are a lot of foot soldiers. He needs a lot of us going out trying to help, to allow him to become the president he's come here to be."" CNN's John Blake contributed to this report.","SCLC president says King supporters must ""march now more than ever before""

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pro-Taliban cleric Sufi Mohammad has announced he has pulled out of a peace deal in the violence-plagued Swat Valley, saying the government is not serious about implementing Islamic law, or sharia, in the region. Supporters of cleric Sufi Mohammad gather as they march during a peace rally in the Swat Valley. Mohammad brokered the cease-fire in late February between the Pakistani government and his son-in-law, Maulana Fazlullah, who commands the Taliban in Swat Valley. With the deal, the area would come under sharia law, which -- under the Taliban's strict interpretation -- would prevent women from even being seen in public without their husbands or fathers. Mohammad has set up a protest camp at the headquarters of his son-in-law's Taliban-aligned group, Tehreek Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi (TNSM), according to a police official. The headquarters are located in Batkhelah in the Malakand agency of North West Frontier Province. Speaking to reporters Thursday, Mohammad expressed frustration that President Asif Ali Zardari had not signed off on the peace deal. He blamed the Pakistani government for any bloodshed that might follow.  Watch how peace talks have hit a hurdle » . Mohammad's pullout does not automatically mean the deal is over. The Taliban, itself, has not announced whether or not it too is pulling out. A lawmaker with the Awami National Party (ANP) of the North West Frontier Province -- where Swat is located -- said he did not expect fighting to resume. ""God willing, there won't be anything that happens to take this [peace] out of our hands,"" said Hashem Baber of the ANP. The province's government will send a contingent to meet with Mohammed and hear his complaints. ""We'll meet and talk and if they have an complaints, we'll try to push those away and solve the situation to get back to the peace deal,"" Baber said. Critics of the cease-fire have called it a major concession by the Pakistani government in an attempt to hold off Taliban attacks. Indeed, after the deal went into effect, Fazlullah proclaimed himself the Emir of Swat. Swat Valley was once one of Pakistan's biggest tourist destinations. It is near the Afghanistan border and is 186 miles (300 kilometers) from the capital, Islamabad. The central government has long exerted little control in the area, but it launched an intense military offensive in late July to flush out militants from areas of the North West Frontier Province . As retaliation for the military presence, the Taliban carried out a series of deadly attacks, beheadings and destruction of girls' schools. They also continued to gain ground, setting up checkpoints throughout the area. Sufi Mohammad was released from jail last year by Pakistani authorities after he agreed to cooperate with the government. He was detained in 2002 after recruiting thousands of fighters to battle U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Fazlullah took over TNSM during Sufi Mohammed's jail stint and vowed to continue his fight to impose fundamentalist Islamic law in the region. Last May, Pakistan's government announced it reached a peace deal with militants in Swat Valley. In the months that followed, the Taliban seized control of the region and carried out a violent campaign against government officials, including local politicians. The head of the secular Awami National Party -- which represents the region -- was forced to flee to Islamabad amid death threats from the Taliban. Pakistan is under enormous pressure to control the militants within its borders, blamed for launching attacks in neighboring Afghanistan where U.S. and NATO forces are fighting militants. The United States -- using unmanned drones -- has carried out several airstrikes inside Pakistan on suspected militant targets, including one on Wednesday that killed three suspected Taliban militants in the tribal region. Such incursions have infuriated many Pakistanis and their leaders. Pakistan's military operation in the region is unpopular among Pakistanis, but efforts to deal diplomatically with militants have not worked in the past. Pakistan's previous leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, reached a cease-fire deal with militants in South Waziristan in 2006 which was widely blamed for giving al Qaeda and the Taliban a stronger foothold in the region.

"(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain on Tuesday proposed lifting the ban on offshore drilling as part of his plan to reduce dependence on foreign oil and help combat rising gas prices. Sen. John McCain says it's time for the federal government ""to put our own reserves to use."" ""The stakes are high for our citizens and for our economy,"" McCain, the presumed Republican nominee for president, said at a press conference Tuesday in Houston, Texas. Hours later, White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said President Bush on Wednesday will ask Congress to lift the ban on offshore drilling. Bush has long called for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil exploration, but Perino said he now wants to go further. ""For years, the president has pushed Congress to expand our domestic oil supply, but Democrats in Congress have consistently blocked such action,"" she said. Earlier in the day, McCain, describing the high price of fuel, confused the cost of gallons versus barrels, which drew laughs from the crowd and the candidate himself. He quickly corrected himself. ""And with gasoline running at more than $4 a barrel ... a gallon ... I wish ... $4 a gallon, many do not have the luxury of waiting on the far-off plans of futurists and politicians,"" he said. ""We have proven oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the United States. But a broad federal moratorium stands in the way of energy exploration and production. And I believe it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions and to put our own reserves to use."" McCain's plan would let individual states decide whether to explore drilling possibilities.  Watch a McCain adviser describe the proposal » . The proposal could put McCain at odds with environmentalists who say it is incongruous with his plans to combat global warning. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a McCain ally, opposes offshore drilling. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist had expressed opposition to exploring coastal waters, but he said this week he supports McCain's plan to lift the moratorium and would not rule out letting his state choose to drill offshore. ""It's the last thing in the world I'd like to do, but I also understand what people are paying at the pump, and I understand the drag it is on our economy,"" Crist told the St. Petersburg Times. ""Something has to be done in a responsible, pragmatic way."" The current law, which has been in effect since 1981, covers most of the country's coastal waters. Many officials from coastal states oppose offshore drilling because of the risk of oil spills. Environmentalists want offshore drilling to stop to protect oceans and beaches from further pollution. ""The next president must be willing to break with the energy policies, not just of the current administration, but the administrations that preceded it, and lead a great national campaign to achieve energy security for America,"" McCain said Tuesday. McCain on Monday said incentives could possibly be provided for states that choose to permit exploration off their coasts, adding that ""exploration is a step toward the longer-term goal."" Tuesday's discussion marks the first in a series of talks about America's energy security that McCain will hold during the next two weeks as he lays out his plan to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil. McCain opposes drilling in some parts of the wilderness and says those areas must be left undisturbed. ""When America set aside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we called it a 'refuge' for a reason,"" he said. McCain also criticized the energy policy of Democratic rival Sen. Barack Obama. ""He says that high oil prices are not the problem, but only that they rose too quickly. He doesn't support new domestic production. He doesn't support new nuclear plants. He doesn't support more traditional use of coal, either,"" McCain said. ""So what does Sen. Obama support in energy policy? Well, for starters, he supported the energy bill of 2005 -- a grab bag of corporate favors that I opposed. And now he supports new taxes on energy producers. He wants a windfall profits tax on oil, to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas. If the plan sounds familiar, it's because that was President Jimmy Carter's big idea too -- and a lot of good it did us."" McCain argues that a windfall profits tax will only increase the country's dependence on foreign oil and be an obstacle to domestic exploration. ""I'm all for recycling -- but it's better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970s,"" he said. Obama on Tuesday blasted McCain for changing his stance on offshore drilling. ""John McCain's support of the moratorium on offshore drilling during his first presidential campaign was certainly laudable, but his decision to completely change his position and tell a group of Houston oil executives exactly what they wanted to hear today was the same Washington politics that has prevented us from achieving energy independence for decades,"" he said. ""It's another example of short-term political posturing from Washington, not the long-term leadership we need to solve our dependence on oil,"" he said. Democratic Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also criticized McCain's plan, saying it would ruin his state's tourism industry and would not solve the problem. ""I thought John McCain was serious when he said he wanted to make America less dependent on oil. I didn't think he was a flip-flopper. He knows that more drilling isn't the solution to high gas prices,"" Nelson said Tuesday. Obama said a windfall profits tax would ease the burden of energy costs on working families. He also wants to invest in affordable, renewable energy sources. Controversy over offshore drilling surfaced in the United States in 1969, after a crack in the seafloor led to a huge oil spill off Santa Barbara, California. During the 1970s, when many Arab nations launched an oil embargo, many U.S. officials pushed for the exploration of offshore drilling of the coastal United States. Environmentalists responded with loud protests. CNN White House Correspondent  Ed Henry contributed to this report .","President Bush plans to ask Congress to lift offshore drilling ban Wednesday .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's foremost aviation showcase celebrates its 60th anniversary this year. The Spitfire is one of the aircraft from Farnborough's inaugural show getting airborne once again to celebrate the airshow's 60th year. The 46th Farnborough International Airshow will commemorate the first show ever held in 1948 at this year's event in Hampshire which runs from July 14 to 20. ""As we look back on the past 60 years, we also are excited to continue looking forward to the next 60 years,"" said John Cairns, Head of Services at Farnborough International Limited (FIL) which runs the biennial airshow. To mark the occasion, Farnborough's world-renowned flying display will include aircraft which flew at the first show like the Swordfish, Spitfire, Sea Hawk and Sea Fury. Adding a modern twist to the mix will be the debut of The Blades, the world's only globally accredited aerobatic airline. The airshow was first established as a way for the British public to see and learn about the best of aviation. Staying true to its original purpose, on both Saturday 19 and Sunday 20 July -- Farnborough's ""public weekend"" -- there will be a four-and-a-half-hour flying display. Highlights include perennial favourites the Red Arrows, the Royal Air Force aerobatic team who will close the show with their aerial gymnastics, as well as the debut of the Aero Sekur Shooting Stars, an Italian ladies' parachute team who will be providing daily skydiving displays. ""Farnborough, in essence, has always been about innovation, and I am delighted that to a long line of distinguished 'Farnborough Firsts' I am able to add some very worthy new firsts, including the first ever women's parachute team to appear at the Airshow; the world's first aerobatic airline and the first business aviation jet to have been developed at Farnborough,"" continued Cairns. As well as displaying aircraft for the public, Farnborough has also established itself as one of the world's premier showcases for the aviation business world. This year, 1,500 companies from 35 countries as diverse as Colombia and Bahrain will be exhibiting planes and other technologies in a show that is predicted to be Farnborough's biggest to date. On the trade days which run from Monday 14 to Friday 18 July, business attendees will be able to see the world's latest aerospace innovations in the air. A full range of civil, business and defence aircraft will take part in flying displays. These include the Airbus AB380; HAL helicopters; the Kestrel JP10 (originally conceived at Farnborough airfield); the MiG 29; the EADS Eurofighter; the F 16 and F18; the MB 346; the AB 609; MB 311. In 2006, Farnborough trade week accumulated $42 billion worth of orders including $550 million in business aviation orders. The Airbus A380 also made its UK debut at Farnborough that year. ""Our intention has always been to build on the success of the 2006 event, and to ensure that this year's show delivers an incomparable business service for our exhibitors and their customers, ensuring that they can gain maximum benefit and opportunity from attending Farnborough Airshow -- whether that is taking orders, making sales or developing new business,"" said Amanda Stainer, the Airshow's Exhibition and Events Director.

"(CNN) -- The Czech Republic's practice of surgically castrating convicted sex offenders is ""invasive, irreversible and mutilating"" and should stop immediately, the Council of Europe's Anti-Torture Committee said in a report made public Thursday. The central European country castrated at least 94 prisoners in the 10 years up to April 2008, when investigators from the Council of Europe, a human-rights forum, visited the Czech Republic. The Council of Europe condemned the practice as ""degrading."" The procedure is being performed even on first-time, non-violent offenders, such as exhibitionists, its investigation revealed. Prisoners have to request castration under Czech law, but many fear they will be jailed for life if they do not, the investigation found. ""In practically all the cases, these patients indicated that their application was at least partially instigated by fear of long-term detention,"" the report said. ""Some patients claimed that the treating sexologist had explicitly told them that surgical castration was the only available option to them and that refusal would mean lifelong detention."" And it warned that some ""significantly"" mentally retarded people had been castrated. ""In at least five cases, legally incapacitated offenders were surgically castrated,"" the report said. ""In all of these instances, the court-appointed guardian had signed the consent form; in two cases, the guardians were mayors."" The investigators found only two convicts who had spontaneously volunteered for castration, while others they interviewed said mental health staff specializing in sexuality had recommended it. ""The other patients interviewed indicated that the treating sexologist had suggested surgical castration, in several cases within a week of the patient's admission to hospital,"" the report said. ""Some of the sexologists interviewed by the delegation themselves affirmed that for certain patients there was no alternative treatment to surgical castration."" The Czech Republic defends the practice as voluntary, saying castration aims permanently to reduce testosterone levels in order to diminish the offender's sexual urges. The process, officially called ""therapeutic testicular pulpectomies ... are performed upon a written request of an adult man,"" the Czech government responded. It said the operation had to be approved by a committee of experts. ""Prior to the performance of such intervention, the patient must express his consent with its performance. Castration is considered with respect to men who cannot manage their sexual instincts and are sexually aggressive,"" the Czech government said, saying the Council of Europe had not proven its case sufficiently for the country to abandon castration. It argues the procedure is effective in reducing repeat offenses. But the Council of Europe questioned the statistics on repeat offenses and said even if they were correct, castration was not an appropriate way to reduce recidivism. ""The committee's delegation came across three cases in which sex offenders had committed serious sex-related crimes, including serial rape and attempted murder, after they had been surgically castrated,"" the human-rights group said. ""Surgical castration is no longer a generally accepted medical intervention in the treatment of sex-offenders,"" the report said. It said candidates for castration often received information about the procedure which was too technical to understand -- or no information at all. ""Several patients who had undergone surgical castration told the delegation that they would never have applied for surgical castration had they been properly informed,"" the report warned. It condemned the practice as ""an irreversible intervention that always leads to infertility and, in the long run, a significantly increased risk of osteoporosis,"" also warning of possible depression and changes in appearance. It said it was impossible to determine how many people had been castrated in keeping with a 1966 law. The Council of Europe delegation visited the Czech Republic from March 25 to April 2, 2008. It issued its report and the Czech response on July 23, 2008. It made them public on Thursday at the request of the Czech government, it said.","Council of Europe says Czechs should abolish it castration law for sex offenders .

"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (CNN -- Relations between Arab nations and the United States hinge on American leaders living up to their rhetoric about commitment to lasting peace in the Mideast,  Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal told CNN Saturday. Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal talks with CNN's Nic Robertson about U.S. relations with Arab nations. ""President Obama, in his statement yesterday, said that he's genuinely making the effort to accomplish a peaceful resolution,"" al-Faisal, who served as Saudi ambassador to the United States from 2005 to 2007, told CNN's Nic Robertson in an interview Friday. ""We've heard this before,"" al-Faisal said. ""We need to see implementation. We need to see facts on the ground change. We need to see rhetoric change. We need to see presence on the ground."" He said he was encouraged by Obama's appointment of George Mitchell as Mideast envoy, saying, ""Mitchell comes with a track record of success."" But he suggested Mitchell spend some time in the region to make real progress. ""American envoys, when they've dealt with the Middle East, have always come and gone,"" he said. ""I think it would be wise for Sen. Mitchell ... to pitch his tent in Ramallah or in Jerusalem, let's say, and spend a year, two, perhaps three years on the ground dealing with the daily aspects of making peace there.""  Watch as al-Faisal talks about how the U.S. and the Mideast could build trust » . The United States' backing of Israel, in light of the latest Israeli military operations in Gaza, does not improve its standing in the Arab world, he said. ""What happened in Gaza, people have called it a tragedy,"" al-Faisal said. ""I'd go further and say it was a catastrophe in all aspects of that word. The killing and the destruction was so barbaric by Israel, and unprecedented in a such a small area like Gaza. They [Israelis] claim that they were very careful about collateral damage and they targeted only Hamas, as they call them, militants and operatives. Well, look at the figures. ""More than 400 children killed out of 1,300 [total deaths]. That doesn't show any precision of targeting. Israel claims that these are mishaps of war. If they are mishaps of war, well, why should you have a war? ""I think this is one of the issues that makes the relationship between the Arab world in general and Saudi Arabia in particular threatened when it comes to dealing with the United States,"" al-Faisal said. ""...  And President Bush, I think callously and unforgivably, gave Israel a green light to do everything that they wanted to do in Gaza without restraint."" U.S. and Israeli officials should recognize that operations like the recent one only serve to strengthen Hamas, as ""Israel is a radioactive element in the area. Anyone it touches becomes heroic and legitimate ... because he or she is a victim."" Al-Faisal said he believes the United States and Israel should negotiate with Hamas. Reminded that the two nations consider Hamas a terrorist organization, he said, ""I think this is another of the things that has to be reviewed by President Obama."" He believes that negotiations with Hamas should not undermine the Palestinian Authority, saying the authority's President Mahmoud Abbas ""in my view, is the most tailor-made Palestinian leader for making peace and bringing stability and security to the Palestinian people."" Israel's operation in Gaza came after what it said was a barrage of rockets fired by Hamas militants into southern Israel. Asked how to stop the rockets, al-Faisal said he thinks the key is to bring Hamas into the political fold. ""Put it the other way,"" he said. ""How can we convince Israel itself not to provoke Hamas into firing rockets?"" Israel claims that Hamas fired first, and al-Faisal said these claims underscore the importance of having someone on the ground like Mitchell. ""To see who is telling the truth in a case like that is needed, and a necessity today, more than at any other time,"" he said. The United States has called for nations like Saudi Arabia to accept Israel and normalize relations with the nation, he said, but Israel must make the first move. ""Israel has to normalize relations with Palestine before Saudi Arabia will normalize relations with Israel. Everybody asks us to recognize Israel and to normalize ... nobody asks Israel to recognize Palestine and normalize relations with Palestine. I think that's unfair."" Arab nations stand ready to make peace with Israel, he said, but Israel has not demonstrated an equal willingness. ""That's the pity of it."" He said Obama should ask Israel to accept the Arab peace plan. ""And when the Israelis accept the Arab peace plan, the Arab world has already set up a mechanism to deal with that issue. They've chosen Egypt and Jordan to sit down with the Israelis and deal with the Arab peace initiative."" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN the nation does not publicly discuss contacts with Arab nations with which it has no official diplomatic relations. Israel welcomed the Saudi peace initiative, he said, and is willing to negotiate with all Arab countries, including the Palestinians. Asked about his confidence in Obama, al-Faisal said, ""I'll have confidence when I see things done on the ground, and President Obama can do something and gain the confidence and support of the Arab and Muslim nations by showing that he has done things on the ground and not simply expressed a wish for that."" If not, he said the Arab world's relationship with the United States is at stake. ""Popular sentiment, already America is at its lowest level in the history of its engagement with the Arab and Muslim world,"" he said. ""In terms of government relations, that is something that will have to be decided by the leaderships in the Arab world and America, but it's not a pretty picture.""","Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal says U.S.-Arab relations hinge on U.S. role in peace .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A Zimbabwe High Court judge is trying to take the country's first lady to court, accusing her of using political muscle to wrest from him a farm he was given during the land seizures. Judge says Grace Mugabe, pictured with her husband, effectively took his farm by force. The matter has not been given a date, however, amid reports that other judges have been refusing to hear it. High Court Judge Ben Hlatshwayo is suing a company owned by Grace Mugabe, wife of President Robert Mugabe, for grabbing Gwina Farm in Banket, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) northwest of Harare. The farm is near Mugabe's rural home. The judge said he acquired the farm in December 2002 as part of President Mugabe's controversial land grabs, in which Mugabe took land from white commercial farmers and distributed it to black Zimbabweans. In an affidavit, filed at the High Court in Harare, the judge said the ""unlawful conduct"" by Grace Mugabe's company, Gushungo Holdings, amounted to spoilation -- or taking of the farm by force. He said emissaries of the first lady have been visiting the farm frequently and issuing instructions to workers, according to court documents. ""There is clearly no lawful basis for such interference, which conduct, by its very nature, amounts to spoliation,"" Hlatshwayo wrote in the papers. Lands and Resettlement Minister Didymus Mutasa said the judge had been given alternative land as compensation for the farm that Grace Mugabe wants to have. Mutasa opposes the judge's affidavit. Hlatshwayo said he had been operating his farm in ""quiet, undisturbed, peaceful possession, occupation and production"" since it was allocated to him. Since the land grabs, Zimbabwe has been facing acute shortages of food that critics say is a result of Mugabe giving the land to inexperienced peasant farmers. But Mugabe blames the West for the shortages, saying Western countries are sabotaging him after he took the land for his people. Mugabe says the land reform was meant to reverse colonial imbalances remaining after British rule. The legal wrangle comes after Grace Mugabe was accused of assaulting a journalist in Hong Kong who wanted to take photos of her while she was on a shopping spree. Lawmakers were supposed to debate a bill next week for a constitutional amendment that would create the new posts called for under the deal, including the post of prime minister for opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. The delay could prolong the country's political and economic crisis. The delay comes a day after the MDC accused Mugabe's ZANU-PF of backtracking on the implementation of a power-sharing deal the party signed with Tsvangirai in September. Tsvangirai agreed last week to join the unity government if ""outstanding issues"" were addressed. While government officials could not be reached for comment, Zimbabwean Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa was quoted by the state media as saying the delay in debate on the constitutional-amendment bill would push back next week's deadline. A coalition government is seen by many as a panacea to halt the meltdown of Zimbabwe's economy. The country is also facing its worst humanitarian crisis, with acute shortages of all essentials such as fuel, food, electricity and public-health delivery system. A ravaging cholera outbreak has affected 65,000 people and claimed close to 3,500 lives since its outbreak in August.","Zimbabwe High Court judge sues country's first lady over seized farm .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- For more than a year, the criminal justice students jotted details of Chandra Levy's final movements onto a huge timeline taped to a classroom wall, culled the Internet and public records for scraps of information, and pored over the model skeleton laid out on a table in their lab at Bauder College in Atlanta, Georgia. Antonio Wilson, from left clockwise, Lashaun Bates, Jennifer Gosdin and Charna-Marie Dixon. They spent hours with the slain intern's mother, Susan Levy, who flew from her home in California to Atlanta just to talk to them. Chandra Levy had studied criminal justice in college, too. They began with a list of five suspects, then narrowed it down to one. On December 28, they mailed their findings to the police chief in Washington, D.C. They never heard back. But on Saturday, the text and phone messages began to fly. There's a suspect, they told each other with excitement. An arrest is imminent. ""It completely validates 15 months of work,"" their teacher, Sheryl McCollum, said that Saturday morning. ""We knew this case was solvable. There was no reason for it not to be solved.""  Meet the members of the campus crime club » . A week ago, the police chief in Washington, D.C., called Levy's parents and told them a suspect in the 2001 slaying soon would be arrested. ""I got a call from the Washington police department, just to give me a heads up that there's a warrant out for the arrest,"" said Susan Levy, the victim's mother. She added that police did not provide a name, but sources later identified him to CNN as Ingmar Guandique. Guandique is serving a 10-year prison sentence for two assaults in Washington's Rock Creek Park that occurred around the time of Levy's disappearance. Levy's remains were found in the park. For the Bauder College students, the break in the case was no cause for self-congratulations. They can't disclose their findings to the public. It's part of the deal they make at the start of each investigation. Even though they couldn't name their suspect, or even discuss details of what they found, they didn't carry themselves like people who had missed the mark when they met with CNN on Monday. There were big smiles and, in more reflective moments, small tears. Antonio Wilson and Jennifer Gosdin, two students who last year shared logs of their progress with CNN, said they hoped Levy's mother, father and brother can now find some comfort and peace. If they were able to help the Levys in some way, they are glad. Wilson, who hopes to be a probation officer, said he got more out of the experience than he ever expected. ""It's not my area, but I loved it,"" he said. ""Once you get involved in it, it becomes personal,"" Gosdin agreed. For Naomi Barkley and La-Shawn Bates, the case got personal when they met Susan Levy. ""You could see the hurt in her face,"" Bates recalled. ""You can't help but want to make it right for her. McCollum was in Florida with her family when the news of a suspect broke. She was on the phone with Susan Levy before the sun came up in California. Yes, Levy said, it's true, adding that she was grateful to the students for keeping people focused on her daughter's case, McCollum recalled. McCollum worked as a victims' advocate in the criminal justice system in Fulton County, Georgia, for 25 years before taking a teaching job at Bauder College. In 2005, she launched the Cold Case Investigations Research Institute. It's a fancy name for a campus crime club. The students aren't graded, and they don't receive class credits. But the payoff for the hours they invest includes hands-on experience working real cases and access to experts and criminal justice professionals. Using real-life cases is the best way to groom the next generation of crime-solvers, McCollum believes. Many of the 850 students at Bauder College juggle full-time jobs and families with their course work. About 80 of them are members of the crime club. They are joined by students at two other campuses: Auburn University-Montgomery and Faulkner University in Alabama. Auburn students examined crime scene and geographic details, while Faulkner students delved into the victim's profile. The Bauder students focused on the suspects. Past cases include Tupac Shakur, the hip-hop artist gunned down in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Wayne Williams, the man convicted in the Atlanta child murders case. Students found the Williams case solvable, but Shakur's slaying was ruled ""undetermined."" The Levy investigation was deemed ""solvable."" It seemed to carry special meaning for the students. ""With Chandra, she was a criminal justice major at one time, and she had aspirations of going into the federal government; a lot of our students do as well,"" McCollum said at the outset of the project. ""The students became completely dedicated once they met the family members of the victims,"" McCollum said. ""The victims are real people, the cases are real cases, and the research is real investigative work.""","Group can't divulge whom it named as a suspect in Chandra Levy case .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Natasha Richardson, the Tony Award-winning stage actress and member of the famed Redgrave acting clan, died Wednesday from injuries suffered in a ski accident. She was 45. Comedian Joan Rivers says actress Natasha Richardson had ""such a family."" On Wednesday night's ""Larry King Live,"" comedian Joan Rivers remembered Richardson for her marriage to actor Liam Neeson and used her sharp wit to recall her own skiing experience. The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: You knew Natasha Richardson. What was your reaction? Joan Rivers: Oh, [it] shouldn't have happened. We were more acquaintances than friends. But we spent one amazing day on a boat with my whole family and she and Liam and the boys. And they were such a family. King: What was the occasion? Rivers: We were all in the Caribbean, and we all kind of knew each other from dinner parties and so forth. And we met at the airport, and we said, ""Oh, let's get together, with the kids."" And it was one of those wonderful days. We laughed and talked and had lunch, and the kids were jumping off the boat and we were drinking wine. She was just amazing and darling. King: Have you seen her work on Broadway? Rivers: I've seen her work. I love actresses who go back and forth. I always have such great respect for someone who goes to Broadway and then film and goes back again. I saw her in ""The Philadelphia Story"" years ago in London when she won an award. She was very young in a musical version of that. King: What was your read on them as a couple that day? Rivers: Totally happy, totally devoted to each other. That's what kills me. I mean [it] just shouldn't have happened. ... And they made such a good-looking couple, too. He doted on what she said, she doted on -- it was just perfect. King: How did you learn of this yesterday? Rivers: One of our mutual friends called me and said, do you know about -- I just saw them recently in the thing that Prince Charles gave in England, and a mutual friend said, did you heard about what happened to Natasha? I said, what are you talking about? And he said, she's brain-dead.  Watch King talk to celebrities about Richardson » . King: So you knew yesterday? Rivers: I knew yesterday. And I knew yesterday that she was brain-dead. And I was told, which is, again, so dear, that they kept her alive purposely to bring her back to New York, so that the boys could say goodbye to her before -- . King: Really? Rivers: Yes. King: That's both beautiful and sad. Rivers: Look at this, it gets me crazy. It's sad. King: Do you ski? Rivers: I had a terrible fall about 12 years ago. And I lay there in the snow and I said to myself, ""If I get up, I'm not coming back and I got up."" King: You're like, ""Goodbye."" Rivers: Goodbye. And I swear to you, I laid on the ground and I go, ""If everything works, that's it. That's it."" King: You've heard the doctor. What do you make of this? There must have been something previously. It was a slight fall? Rivers: You don't know; you hit your head wrong. You walk out of your house and it's over. We all know that, especially at this age. You understand that it's over, it's gone. It's just not that [Richardson's] age, not with a good marriage, not with two young boys. It shouldn't be. King: John Kennedy said life isn't fair. Rivers: It isn't. It isn't.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The collective cry throughout India of ""Jai ho"" (May you win) received a resounding answer when composer A.R. Rahman took home two Oscars for the movie ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Composer A. R. Rahman, ""The Mozart of Madras,"" celebrates his double Oscar win -- for Best Score and one for the song ""Jai Ho"" from the film. Rahman's wins -- one for the song ""Jai Ho"" and the other for Best Score -- were just two reasons for Indians to erupt in boisterous celebrations Monday morning. ""Slumdog,"" which was shot in the streets and slums of Mumbai bagged eight golden statuettes in total, including one for Best Sound Mixing. Indian Resul Pookutty shared it with fellow sound editors who worked on the film. ""This is the finest hour of Indian cinema in the global scenario,"" said Anand Sharma, the country's junior external affairs minister. Indians crowded around television sets in dorm rooms, restaurants and homes, exhaling in relief as Rahman's name was announced as the winner. They high-fived each other, hugged, shrieked and wept. ""I cannot describe this feeling,"" said Nikhil Jyonti, a Mumbai resident. ""I'm bursting with pride for India."" In the Mumbai slum of Dharavi, where many of the scenes in ""Slumdog"" were shot, a television  was set out for the street children to watch the ceremony. Few in the teeming slum of one million people had heard of the Oscars, but they knew Rahman's win was a source of pride for the country. Danny Boyle's rags-to-riches film tells the story of a tea-boy at a Mumbai call center who earns a spot in the Indian version of the quiz show ""Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?"" He raises the suspicion of the show's host when, despite the lack of a formal education, he begins to answer the increasingly difficult questions with ease. The movie also won four Golden Globes and a host of honors at other award shows. While the overwhelming sentiment was one of pride Monday, the movie has faced backlash from many Indian movie critics who took exception to its depiction of Mumbai's underworld without highlighting any of the city's achievements. Among the most notable criticisms was one offered by Amitabh Bachchan, considered the most successful movie star in Bollywood history, and a former real-life host of the Indian ""Millionaire."" The film,"" he said, ""projects India as the third world's dirty underbelly ... and causes pain and disgust among nationalists and patriots."" But most Mumabikers, still reeling from a terrorist attack in their city in November, embraced the movie while looking for something positive to root for. They found that in Rahman, a composer who has consistently broken barriers in his musical scores for dozens of Bollywood hits and is known as the ""Mozart of Madras."" Rahman has sold more than 200 million albums worldwide -- more than the Beatles -- but has remained relatively unknown in Europe and the United States. Director Spike Lee used one of his songs in his 2006 heist film, ""Inside Man."" Many hope the Oscar win will bring Rahman greater exposure. Rahman and Pookutty, however, aren't the first Indians with Academy Awards to their names. In 1992, legendary Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray received an honorary award for his contribution to world cinema. And in 1982, Bhanu Athaiya shared an Oscar for costume design for the movie ""Gandhi."" CNN's Saeed Ahmed and Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report .","India celebrated composer A.R.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration is looking into a report that Louisiana Sen. David Vitter had an angry altercation with an airline worker at Washington Dulles International Airport last week. Louisiana Sen. David Vitter reportedly went into a ""tirade"" with a Washington Dulles International Airport worker. The agency is not doing a formal investigation, TSA spokesman Sterling Payne told CNN, but it is gathering information to determine if one is needed. ""We are looking into the reported incident,"" Payne said. An aide to Vitter said Friday morning the Republican senator had not been contacted by the TSA and maintains the media account of the incident is overblown. Roll Call had a report in its gossip column earlier this week, based on an unnamed eyewitness, that Vitter arrived at the airport 20 minutes before his United Airlines flight was scheduled to depart. The door to the boarding bridge was already closed, but Vitter opened it anyway, triggering an alarm. The paper said an airline worker warned him not to enter the walkway, which led to a ""tirade"" by Vitter who ""remained defiant."" The source told Roll Call the senator left the area before airport police arrived. Vitter has refused to answer reporters' questions about the incident, but in a statement Wednesday described his actions more innocently and the Roll Call report ""silly."" ""After being delayed on the Senate floor ensuring a vote on my anti-pay raise amendment and in a rush to make my flight home for town hall meetings the next day, I accidentally went through the wrong door at the gate,"" he said. ""I did have a conversation with an airline employee, but it was certainly not like this silly gossip column made it out to be."" Vitter has been the subject of unwelcome headlines before. In 2007, he was linked to a Washington, D.C., prostitution ring. He denied allegations he had relationships with prostitutes, but apologized for ""a very serious sin."" Joel DiGrado, Vitter's spokesman, said the congressman would not comment further on the issue. CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","TSA gathers information about alleged incident involving Louisiana Sen. David Vitter .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Hundreds of thousands of visitors to the National Mall crowded Metro stations around Washington on Tuesday, slowing movement to a crawl after the inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States. A security tower stands over the crowd that came to watch Barack Obama's inauguration. ""All of our stations are overcrowded,"" said Lisa Farbstein, spokeswoman for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. ""It's taking hours for people to get back into the stations."" Police were holding people outside some Metro stations until there was room for them to get in, Farbstein said. But as evening fell and celebrations moved indoors, observers said crowd flow on the Metro system was smoother, if still an effort in patience. As of 7 p.m. Tuesday, the Metro had counted 973,285 passenger trips, setting a record with several hours and many miles yet to go. ""Throughout the weekend, we've effectively dealt with record-breaking crowds,"" said Metro General Manager John Catoe. ""By 5 p.m., people had taken nearly 874,000 trips, breaking yesterday's ridership record with nine more hours of service to go."" Monday's 866,681 passenger trips had been the Metro record. The Metro numbers were just one record-setting tally in a day that lived up to expectations in sheer crowd size alone. Crowds on the National Mall were so large that the National Park Service began closing portions of it by 9 a.m., three hours before Obama took his oath of office. A crowd of 1.5 million people packed the Mall for the inauguration, according to an analysis of satellite imagery provided to CNN by IHS Jane's, a leading information provider on defense, international risk and national security. Officials said the massive security for the event was running smoothly, although there had been what they described as minor miscommunications, such as a Metro station entrance being closed when it was not supposed to be. The crowd was orderly, and there had been no reports of major incidents or concerns. FBI spokesman Jason Pack said there had been no arrests related to the inauguration so far. FBI and partner agencies investigated about a dozen reports of suspicious incidents or people, but none was anything serious. About 957 people visited the medical tents on the mall for various first-aid needs. Some security screening lines ran slowly, officials said, but there had not been any major systemic problems. Earlier in the day, federal officials were reviewing an unspecified threat to disrupt the inauguration, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The FBI was investigating two ""streams of intelligence"" suggesting that Somalia-based terrorist organization Al Shabaab may have been plotting an attack timed to coincide with the event, the FBI and Homeland Security said in a joint threat advisory obtained by CNN. Security officials made some readjustments to inauguration security as a precaution and did not change the threat level, an administration official said. The ceremony went off without incident. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice designated al-Shabaab, also known as the Mujahedeen Youth Movement, a ""Foreign Terrorist Organization"" in February. The State Department calls it ""a violent and brutal extremist group with a number of individuals affiliated with al Qaeda. Many of its senior leaders are believed to have trained and fought with al Qaeda in Afghanistan."" Also Tuesday, a false alarm prompted police to temporarily close a 25-mile stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike, authorities said. Investigators had received a tip that a man headed to Washington was threatening the inaugural, but they eventually determined ""there is no danger to the public,"" FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver said. Two law enforcement sources said the man's mother phoned in a tip to authorities saying her son was traveling in a vehicle containing a bomb. New Jersey State Police stopped a man in a vehicle on the highway Tuesday afternoon, questioned him and searched his vehicle, several law enforcement sources said. Officials said he never posed a threat. It's unclear what, if any, action might be taken against the mother. Tuesday in Washington, tens of thousands of police officers, federal agents and National Guardsmen were deployed on land, water and in the air in an unprecedented effort to make sure the inauguration was secure. The security effort involved Secret Service agents; 8,000 police officers from the District of Columbia and other jurisdictions; 10,000 National Guardsmen; about 1,000 FBI personnel; and hundreds of others from the Department of Homeland Security, the National Park Service and U.S. Capitol Police. Another 20,000 members of the National Guard were ready to respond if there was an emergency, said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. Security planners drew up procedures to deal with improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers and the use of a weapon of mass destruction. A recent intelligence assessment, however, said a lone wolf would pose the greatest potential threat. Chertoff said an individual or small group planning to do harm is difficult to detect. ""Whether the motivation is racism or some psychological disorder ... in an open society, it is impossible to keep a single individual from doing some damage,"" he said.  Watch the anti-sniper detail prepare » . Federal officials acknowledged that the inauguration of the first African-American president could make an attractive target. Since Obama's election, the number of threats against him has increased, according to a recent federal intelligence assessment. The FBI has been especially aggressive in examining white supremacist groups. They have ramped up their anti-Obama comments, officials said, but it appears to be more talk than action. Because inaugural events are spread over four days, security is especially challenging. Organizers say they started their security planning the day after the last inauguration and ramped up their efforts in July. CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Pam Benson, Kevin Bohn, Carol Cratty and Rob Frehse contributed to this report.","Metro stations packed; some wait hours to get home .

"Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a nationally syndicated columnist and a member of the editorial board of the San Diego Union-Tribune. Read his column here . Ruben Navarrette says Mexico isn't a failed state, but the fate of its drug war is important for US. SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- You may have heard the rumor that, as a result of a bloody drug war that has claimed more than 7,000 lives since January 2007, Mexico is on the verge of being declared a ""failed state."" Drawing a lot of its oxygen from cable demagogues and talk radio, the chatter intensified several weeks ago when the Pentagon issued a report warning that our neighbor -- along with Pakistan, no less -- could face a ""rapid and sudden"" collapse because ""the government, its politicians, police and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels."" How's this for pressure? The police chief in Ciudad Juarez resigned last week after drug traffickers began to make good on their promise to kill police officers in that city until the chief stepped down. The Mexican drug war is the real deal, and so is the threat to both Mexico and the United States. The casualties are mounting. The killings are becoming more brutal, and now include the beheading of soldiers. The cartels are essentially terrorizing the Mexican people in the hopes of convincing them to put pressure on the government to relent in its efforts to put the bad guys out of business. Take it from someone who has known Mexican President Felipe Calderon since before he took the job -- back when we were in graduate school together nearly a decade ago -- that's not going to happen. Calderon was brave enough to take on the drug cartels by arresting their leaders, confiscating their product, and -- most importantly -- seizing the large shipments of cash that they need to operate. And he's smart enough to know that letting up on the pressure before the task is done would only make matters worse and basically hand Mexico over to the drug lords . Meanwhile, there is no question that Americans will pay a price if the drug violence spills over the border. Just a few days ago, the U.S. State Department issued a blunt travel advisory warning Americans with plans to travel in Mexico to be extra careful. ""Recent Mexican army and police confrontations with drug cartels have resembled small-unit combat, with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades,"" the advisory reads. ""Large firefights have taken place in towns and cities ... and during some of these incidents, U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area."" Firefights will put a crimp in the tourist industry. But, Mexicans are quick to point out the irony. Here Americans are worried about their safety in Mexico when one of the reasons the Mexican government is having such a difficult time fighting the drug cartels is because the enemy has plenty of money and guns. And both are coming from the north. According to most estimates, about 90 percent of all the cocaine flowing into the United States comes from Mexico and about 90 percent of the guns seized in drug-related violence come from the United States. Former President George W. Bush and Congress deserve credit for pushing through $400 million in emergency aid in the Merida Initiative to help the Mexican government fight the cartels. And even though Mexico is still waiting for delivery of most of those funds, there were signals this week that the Obama administration understands the stakes involved. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced new measures to prevent the violence from spreading to this side of the border and told Congress that the issue demands the ""utmost attention."" Attorney General Eric Holder called the drug cartels a ""national security threat"" to the United States and said Americans ""simply can't afford to let down our guard."" Even so, this business about Mexico on its way to being a ""failed state"" is just a lot of hot air. The rumors of our neighbor's demise have been greatly exaggerated. A country of 110 million people, Mexico is still a functioning democracy with press freedoms and bold leaders, like Calderon, who are tackling the issue of drug violence head on. There is plenty of reason for optimism. Frankly, one reason the doomsday talk about Mexico catches on is because it distracts Americans from our own problems. I learned a long time ago that, for many of my countrymen, Mexico serves a purpose in tough times by providing something to which we can feel superior. Even with the banking bailouts, mortgage crisis, a plummeting stock market and rising unemployment, the thinking goes, we can at least be grateful that we're not Mexico. For Mexican-Americans like me, that's cold comfort. I expect a lot more of my country -- the United States -- than I do the country that my grandfather left behind a hundred years ago when he legally immigrated north. And right now, what I expect is for all Americans to realize -- and for the Obama administration to never forget -- that it's impossible to feel safe when there is a wildfire in the neighborhood. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Mexico's drug war is serious, but it's not a ""failed state""

"(CNN)  -- An e-mail from one of the crewmen aboard the Maersk Alabama tells a gripping tale of sailors fighting back against pirates who had taken over their ship. Crewman Matt Fisher hopes other ships can learn lessons from the Maersk Alabama takeover and recapture. It also contains some of the lessons they learned and hope to pass on to others who could face the same danger. Crewman Matt Fisher sent the e-mail to a fellow sailor aboard another Maersk ship. The U.S.-flagged Alabama was already heading to Kenya when he sent it, but it was before the U.S. Navy rescued the cargo ship's captain, who was held hostage on a lifeboat by the four pirates. ""The pirates got up to the bridge very quickly once they were onboard,"" Fisher wrote. ""We had a locked cage door over the ladder well from main deck, but it only took a second for them to shoot it off. They then got to the bridge up the outside ladders."" Fisher said that Capt. Richard Phillips and three other sailors were on the bridge when the pirates arrived, adding that he didn't know why they stayed. The rest of the crew, Fisher said, headed below and took positions in the engine and steering areas. One sailor kept watch in the engine control room, he said, while another ""was out on deck tracking the pirates' movement."" ""We kept swinging the rudder side to side,"" Fisher wrote. ""The pirates' boat capsized, though I'm not sure exactly when or what caused it. After about 20 minutes, the engine was killed, I don't know by whom."" After the engine was killed, the sailors shut off the power to the ship as well as the fuel line to the ship's emergency diesel generator. ""I think this was critical,"" Fisher wrote. ""The pirates were very reluctant to go into the dark."" Fisher said the sailors were safe where they were, since the pirates had no grenades and would never have been able break through with only firearms. The only problem, he said, was the heat and a shortage of water. ""In the future, we will store food and water in various spots for emergency usage,"" he said. ""I think we will also run a fresh water line into the steering gear."" Fisher said the sailors were able to sneak up to the engine room water fountain and filled some bottles, and the sailor who'd been on deck tracking the pirates dropped fruit and sodas from the ship's galley through a standpipe to the hidden sailors. At one point, Fisher wrote, the pirates sent one of the four sailors who had remained on the bridge to hunt for the other crew members -- unescorted. He escaped and joined his comrades. Later, one of the pirates escorted another sailor into the engine room, again searching for the missing crew members, but one of the sailors ""was able to jump him in the dark and we took him prisoner."" ""No one else came down into the E/R (engine room),"" he said. ""As the day went on, the pirates became desperate to get out of there."" Phillips finally talked the pirates into taking a small boat used for rescuing a sailor who falls overboard. The three remaining pirates and the captain went down into the boat, and the sailors, now in control of their ship again, dropped food, water and fuel to them. But the small boat wouldn't start. The sailors on board the ship dropped the lifeboat into the water and took it -- and their prisoner -- to the stranded boat with the pirates and the captain, intending to trade boats and prisoners. ""We were supposed to exchange their guy for the Captain, but they ended up keeping him,"" Fisher wrote. ""They motored off in the lifeboat. They had no way of getting back aboard, so we followed them."" A few hours later, the USS Bainbridge arrived on the scene.  Watch crew arrive in the United States » . ""We stayed close by for some time, but then the Navy asked us to head out,"" Fisher said. ""I heard that several other pirate vessels were heading our way and the Navy wanted us out of the way. That's about it."" Eventually, Navy SEALs shot and killed three of the pirates aboard the lifeboat. Phillips was freed, and the remaining pirate was taken prisoner. But the Maersk Alabama, with U.S. Navy protection aboard, was nearing Mombasa, Kenya, by that time. At the end of his e-mail, Fisher went over the what the Alabama's crew had learned. ""Have a well-fortified location with food and water supply. Kill all the lights. Leave the alarms going, the noise helped cover our movements through the house. Flashlights and radios are very handy, as well as the sound-powered phone."" ""It was a pretty stressful situation,"" Fisher wrote. ""I have to say I am impressed with how the entire crew responded. We didn't have anybody who wanted to give up."" Fisher also said he was ""pretty confident"" that his captain would come out of the ordeal ""OK.""  Watch Capt. Phillips arrive in Kenya » . ""They have to know that if they kill him they'll be done,"" he said.","Matt Fisher, crewman on Alabama, sent e-mail to sailor on another Maersk ship .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Interrogation tactics such as waterboarding, sleep deprivation and slapping did not violate laws against torture when there was no intent to cause severe pain, according to a Bush-era memo on the tactics released Thursday. Attorney General Eric Holder says government workers who followed protocol won't be prosecuted. ""To violate the statute, an individual must have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering,"" said an August 2002 memo from then-Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee to John Rizzo, who was acting general counsel for the CIA. ""Because specific intent is an element of the offense, the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture. ... We have further found that if a defendant acts with the good faith belief that his actions will not cause such suffering, he has not acted with specific intent,"" Bybee wrote. The Bybee opinion was sought on 10 interrogation tactics in the case of suspected al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah. The memo authorized keeping Zubaydah in a dark, confined space small enough to restrict the individual's movement for no more than two hours at a time. In addition, putting a harmless insect into the box with Zubaydah, who ""appears to have a fear of insects,"" and telling him it is a stinging insect would be allowed, as long as Zubaydah was informed the insect's sting would not be fatal or cause severe pain. ""If, however, you were to place the insect in the box without informing him that you are doing so ... you should not affirmatively lead him to believe that any insect is present which has a sting that could produce severe pain or suffering or even cause his death,"" the memo said. Other memos allowed the use of such tactics as keeping a detainee naked and in some cases in a diaper, and putting detainees on a liquid diet. On waterboarding, in which a person gets the sensation of drowning, the memo said, ""although the waterboard constitutes a threat of imminent death, prolonged mental harm must nonetheless result"" to violate the law. Authorities also were allowed to slap a detainee's face ""to induce shock, surprise or humiliation"" and strike his abdomen with the back of the hand in order to disabuse a detainee's notion that he will not be touched, the memos said. Bybee noted in the memo that the CIA agreed all tactics should be used under expert supervision. Other memos said waterboarding can be used only if the CIA has ""credible intelligence that a terrorist attack is imminent"" and if a detainee is believed to have information that could prevent, disrupt or delay an attack, and other methods fail to elicit the information. Another memo to Rizzo, from Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury on May 10, 2005, noted that nudity could be used as an interrogation technique. ""Detainees subject to sleep deprivation who are also subject to nudity as a separate interrogation technique will at times be nude and wearing a diaper,"" it said, noting that the diaper is ""for sanitary and health purposes of the detainee; it is not used for the purpose of humiliating the detainee and it is not considered to be an interrogation technique."" ""The detainee's skin condition is monitored, and diapers are changed as needed so that the detainee does not remain in a soiled diaper,"" the memo said. Another Bradbury memo laid out techniques and when they should be used in a ""prototypical interrogation."" ""Several of the techniques used by the CIA may involve a degree of physical pain, as we have previously noted, including facial and abdominal slaps, walling, stress positions and water dousing,"" it said. ""Nevertheless, none of these techniques would cause anything approaching severe physical pain."" All of the CIA techniques were adapted from military ""survival evasion resistance escape"" training, according to a May 30, 2005, memo from Bradbury to Rizzo. ""Although there are obvious differences between training exercises and actual interrogations, the fact that the United States uses similar techniques on its own troops for training purposes strongly suggests that these techniques are not categorically beyond the pale,"" the memo said. The memo said waterboarding and other techniques were used on Zubaydah; Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and identified as ""KSM"" in the memo; and another suspected al Qaeda leader, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. ""The CIA believes that it would have been unable to obtain critical information from numerous detainees, including KSM and Abu Zubaydah, without these enhanced techniques,"" the memo said. ""These legal legal memoranda demonstrate in alarming detail exactly what the Bush administration authorized for 'high value detainees' in U.S. custody,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in a statement. ""The techniques are chilling. This was not an 'abstract legal theory,' as some former Bush administration officials have characterized it. These were specific techniques authorized to be used on real people."" In releasing the memos in response to a public records request from the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups, the Obama administration informed CIA officials they will not be prosecuted for past waterboarding and other harsh interrogation tactics. Attorney General Eric Holder promised in a separate statement that officials who used the controversial interrogation tactics were in the clear if their actions were consistent with the legal advice from the Justice Department under which they were operating at the time. ""My judgment on the content of these memos is a matter of record,"" President Obama said in a statement released from the White House. Obama prohibited the use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" such as waterboarding shortly after taking office in January. Such techniques ""undermine our moral authority and do not make us safer,"" he said Thursday. The president said that while United States must sometimes ""protect information that is classified for purposes of national security,"" he decided to release the memos because he believes ""strongly in transparency and accountability"" and ""exceptional circumstances surround these memos and require their release."" Obama argued that ""withholding these memos would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time."" ""This could contribute to an inaccurate accounting of the past, and fuel erroneous and inflammatory assumptions about actions taken by the United States,"" he said. He added that the officials involved in the questionable interrogations would not be subject to prosecution because the intelligence community must be provided ""with the confidence"" it needs to do its job. The president pledged to work to ensure the actions described in the memos ""never take place again."" CNN's Kate Bolduan and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","Memo: To violate torture law, must have intent to inflict severe suffering .

"CAIRO, Egypt (CNN)  -- Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met Thursday in Cairo amid escalating cross-border violence between Israel and Hamas. Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni meets Thursday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo. The session follows the end of a tenuous 6-month-long cease-fire between the Israeli military and Hamas militants in Gaza. Egypt mediated the first truce and is trying to negotiate an extension despite what Israel says are dozens of rockets fired by Hamas into the Jewish state this week. Livni criticized Hamas after her meeting with Mubarak. ""Hamas needs to understand that Israel's basic desire to live in a tranquil region doesn't mean that Israel is willing to accept ongoing shooting at its population,"" she said, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. ""Enough is enough. We cannot accept this situation, and the situation will change."" Egypt expressed concern about a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, an Israeli Foreign Ministry statement said. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said this week that it would help countries and organizations deliver aid through Egyptian territory to Palestinians in Gaza. Livni also met with the head of Egyptian intelligence Thursday and is scheduled to talk with the Egyptian foreign minister. Israeli military officials said Hamas militants fired more than 65 rockets into southern Israel on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Israeli air force said it killed a Hamas militant who was part of a group launching the rockets into Israel. An Israeli police spokesman said no one had been injured in the latest barrage of rocket attacks. But emergency workers with Magen David Adom, Israel's Red Cross agency, treated 57 people suffering from shock, half of them children, an agency official said, adding that 200 ambulances were standing by in the area. ""I think the circumstances are extremely tragic, that Muslim zealots of Hamas have decided to shatter and ruin the Christmas celebrations of the Christian brothers in the Holy Land, both in the West Bank and of course in Gaza itself,"" Israeli Welfare Minister Isaac Herzog said. ""If things deteriorate further, then of course we'll have to take necessary action, which will be very painful,"" Herzog said, adding that civilians had gathered in shelters in southern Israel to try to stay safe amid the rocket attacks. Asked about the possibility of Israel coming up with a new strategy, Herzog responded, ""The new strategy could be, of course, an all-out conflict against Hamas, which is a possibility that voices in Israel are calling for. We are trying to show restraint."" Hamas is a Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist organization whose military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, has admitted responsibility for terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians as well as attacks against the Israeli military. Israel and the U.S. State Department consider Hamas a terrorist organization, though it also operates an extensive social services network in the territories. Mark Regev, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, said, ""Our position is clear: We will answer quiet with quiet, and we will answer attacks with measures designed to protect our people."" Olmert has threatened to respond to the ongoing attacks. The truce between the Hamas government in Gaza and Israel expired Friday. Under the Egyptian-brokered deal, Hamas agreed to end militant attacks on Israel from Gaza, and Israel agreed to halt raids inside the territory and ease its blockade on humanitarian goods. In reality, the truce had started breaking down two months ago. Rocket attacks by militants became more frequent, and Israel resumed airstrikes inside Gaza. ""We really appreciate the Egyptian efforts. ...,"" Herzog said. ""The Egyptians have tried endlessly and tirelessly in the past few weeks to bring Hamas back to cease-fire mode."" Olmert said Sunday that Israel will ""take the necessary measures"" to respond to the rocket attacks and ""will know when to respond correctly and with the necessary responsibility."" ""A responsible government is neither eager for battle, nor does it shy away from it,"" he said.","Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak hold talks .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- George Harrison's closest friends and family gathered in Hollywood on Tuesday to dedicate the late Beatle's star on the Walk of Fame. From left, musicians Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and Paul McCartney join Harrison's relatives for dedication of his star. ""There's someone here from every important stage of George's life and career,"" Harrison's widow, Olivia, said. Harrison, who was 58 when he died of cancer in 2001, becomes the second Beatle with a Hollywood star. John Lennon was the first. The new star is next to the iconic Hollywood headquarters of Capitol Records, the distributor of much of Harrison's music for the past five decades. Tuesday's ceremony coincided with the Capitol/EMI announcement that it will release Harrison's first solo greatest hits collection -- ""Let it Roll: Songs by George Harrison"" -- on June 16. Actor Tom Hanks said the world changed for him in January 1964 when he heard his first Beatles song. ""That's when we escaped the doldrums and moved on to a brighter, better, more joyful future,"" Hanks said. Superstar musicians Paul McCartney, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh and Jeff Lynne attended the star's dedication, but they did not address the crowd. Scores of Harrison fans showed up for the event, with some traveling from as far as Liverpool, England. ""We all have deep feelings for George, because he was such a deep-feeling person,"" Olivia Harrison said. ""He was a beautiful, mystical man, living in a material world,"" she said. ""He was funny as the day is long and just as perplexing."" His son, Dhani, 30, joked about his father's star. ""It's good, it's lovely and it's nice and shiny and I'm glad it's not outside of Frederick's of Hollywood,"" he said. Harrison was just 15 when schoolmate Paul McCartney asked him to join his and John Lennon's band, the Quarrymen. The band evolved into the Beatles and the rest is history. Harrison played lead guitar and sang for the Beatles. Songs penned by Harrison included ""Taxman,"" ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" ""Something"" and ""Here Comes the Sun."" Harrison was a pioneer of what has since become a tradition of rock stars supporting charitable causes with their music. In 1971, he helped organize the star-studded ""Concert for Bangladesh"" at New York's Madison Square Garden. In addition to his post-Beatles solo career, Harrison played with several groups -- most notably the Traveling Wilburys, alongside Petty, Lynne, Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan.

"(CNN) -- NASA scientists say new data provided by twin spacecraft analyzing the sun will help them more accurately predict how so-called solar tsunamis wreak havoc on our planet. NASA says new data on so-called solar tsunamis will help predict how they will affect our planet. The tsunamis -- powerful explosions known as coronal mass ejections, or CMEs -- produce solar cosmic rays that can interfere with technology, causing power blackouts and disrupting air traffic communications and cell phone networks. NASA says images captured by its twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or STEREO, spacecraft have enabled scientists to map the tsunamis in 3D to examine their structure, velocity, mass and direction. The solar ejections, its says, can release billions of tons of high-velocity plasma into space, producing a shockwave that generates cosmic rays which then plow into our atmosphere. These can create the brightly-colored auroras, more commonly known as the Northern or Southern lights, but also have more damaging effects, posing particular threats to spacecraft and astronauts. Solar physicist Angelos Vourlidas of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington said the new data from the STEREO craft -- launched into orbit in October 2006 -- will revolutionize the study of cosmic weather patterns. ""Before this unique mission, measurements and the subsequent data of a CME observed near the sun had to wait until the ejections arrived at Earth three to seven days later,"" he said in statement. ""Now we can see a CME from the time it leaves the solar surface until it reaches Earth and we can reconstruct the event in 3D directly from the images.""","NASA says new data will enable scientists to map solar tsunamis in 3D .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Roy Bennett, the former Zimbabwean opposition activist who was arrested Friday shortly before he was due to become a Cabinet minister, has been charged with conspiracy to commit banditry, sabotage and terrorism, his lawyer told CNN. Roy Bennett, left, pictured with MDC leader Morgan Tzvangirai, is also the party's treasurer. The Movement for Democratic Change nominated Bennett to be deputy minister of agriculture in a national unity government with President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party, which has ruled the country since independence in 1980. Bennett was arrested on Friday while on his way to South Africa, where he has been living for three years. Bennett, who is also the party's treasurer, was pulled from an aircraft at the airport in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, the MDC said. Police accuse him of funding the acquisition of weapons to commit the crimes he is charged with. Bennett will appear in the Mutare magistrate's court on Monday, his lawyer Trust Maanda told CNN. Bennett, a white coffee grower, is an old foe of Mugabe's government. His farms were seized during the country's controversial land reform program. He has previously being jailed for assaulting Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa in parliament. Hundreds of party members and supporters Friday surrounded the Mutare police station where Bennett was being held, the party said. The incident happened the same day that other MDC ministers in the new unity government took their oaths of office. The swearing-in eventually took place but was delayed, the MDC said, because Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party wanted to appoint more ministers than they were allowed in the new government. Under the power-sharing deal signed in September, the ruling ZANU-PF party gets 17 cabinet posts and the MDC gets 13. Mugabe brought a ""bloated"" list of 22 Cabinet ministers to the swearing-in ceremony, but the MDC leadership insisted Mugabe stick to the 17 agreed Cabinet posts. The stalemate lasted for more than an hour, until Mugabe's party agreed that only 17 of their proposed ministers take office.

"(CNN) -- Rapid-fire TV news bulletins or getting updates via social-networking tools such as Twitter could numb our sense of morality and make us indifferent to human suffering, scientists say. Scientists say updates on networking tools such as Twitter are often too quick for the brain to fully digest. New findings show that the streams of information provided by social networking sites are too fast for the brain's ""moral compass"" to process and could harm young people's emotional development. Before the brain can fully digest the anguish and suffering of a story, it is being bombarded by the next news bulletin or the latest Twitter update, according to a University of Southern California study. ""If things are happening too fast, you may not ever fully experience emotions about other people's psychological states and that would have implications for your morality,"" said researcher Mary Helen Immordino-Yang. The report, published next week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Online Early Edition, studied how volunteers responded to real-life stories chosen to stimulate admiration for virtue or skill, or compassion for physical or social pain. iReport.com: Growing pains for Twitter, Facebook? Brain scans showed humans can process and respond very quickly to signs of physical pain in others, but took longer to show admiration or compassion. ""For some kinds of thought, especially moral decision-making about other people's social and psychological situations, we need to allow for adequate time and refection,"" said Immordio-Yang. She said the study raises questions about the emotional cost, particularly for young people, of heavy reliance on a torrent of news snippets delivered via TV and online feeds such as Twitter. She said: ""We need to understand how social experience shapes interactions between the body and mind, to produce citizens with a strong moral compass."" USC sociologist Manuel Castells said the study raised more concerns over fast-moving TV than the online environment. ""In a media culture in which violence and suffering becomes an endless show, be it in fiction or in infotainment, indifference to the vision of human suffering gradually sets in."" Research leader Antonio Damasio, director of USC's Brain and Creativity Institute, said the findings stressed the need for slower delivery of the news, and highlighted the importance of slow-burn emotions like admiration. Damasio cited the example of U.S. President Barack Obama, who says he was inspired by his father, to show how admiration can be key to cultural success. ""We actually separate the good from the bad in great part thanks to the feeling of admiration. It's a deep physiological reaction that's very important to define our humanity."" Twitter, which allows users to swap messages and links of 140-characters or less, says on its Web site that it sees itself as a solution to information overload, rather than a cause of it. This function, It says, ""means you can step in and out of the flow of information as it suits you and it never queues up with increasing demand of your attention.""","USC study says rapid-fire Twitter and news updates are too fast for brain .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It was inevitable that a tragedy on the scale of Hillsborough, when 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death during an FA Cup semifinal with Nottingham Forest, would have a transformative effect on English football. A Liverpool supporter Wednesday, outside Anfield. Ninety-six fans died from the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. But there was little reason to believe 20 years ago that, rather than being pushed even further towards the margins of society, the sport was on the brink of a revolution that would give birth to a global sporting phenomenon. Even before Hillsborough, it had seemed as if there was something irredeemably rotten at the heart of English football. Hooliganism, a scourge synonymous with the English game, had receded from its peak in the 1970s but English clubs were outlawed from European competition after rampaging Liverpool fans caused a wall to collapse at Brussels' Heysel Stadium before the 1985 European Cup final, causing the deaths of 39 people, mostly supporters of the Italian side Juventus. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, showing little understanding or patience for the traditions of the sport, had virtually ghettoized fans, promoting a scheme to have each supporter issued with an identity card. On the field, sides such as Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Nottingham Forest were renowned for their attractive play but elsewhere a corrosive cult of long ball football pervaded the game. That trend seemed to find vindication when arch-exponents Wimbledon, who in the course of a decade had bullied and scrapped their way through four divisions to reach the top flight, defeated Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup final, prompting match commentator John Motson to declare that ""the Crazy Gang have beaten the Culture Club.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It was inevitable that a tragedy on the scale of Hillsborough, when 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death during an FA Cup semifinal with Nottingham Forest, would have a transformative effect on English football. A Liverpool supporter Wednesday, outside Anfield. Ninety-six fans died from the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. But there was little reason to believe 20 years ago that, rather than being pushed even further towards the margins of society, the sport was on the brink of a revolution that would give birth to a global sporting phenomenon. Even before Hillsborough, it had seemed as if there was something irredeemably rotten at the heart of English football. Hooliganism, a scourge synonymous with the English game, had receded from its peak in the 1970s but English clubs were outlawed from European competition after rampaging Liverpool fans caused a wall to collapse at Brussels' Heysel Stadium before the 1985 European Cup final, causing the deaths of 39 people, mostly supporters of the Italian side Juventus. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, showing little understanding or patience for the traditions of the sport, had virtually ghettoized fans, promoting a scheme to have each supporter issued with an identity card. On the field, sides such as Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Nottingham Forest were renowned for their attractive play but elsewhere a corrosive cult of long ball football pervaded the game. That trend seemed to find vindication when arch-exponents Wimbledon, who in the course of a decade had bullied and scrapped their way through four divisions to reach the top flight, defeated Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup final, prompting match commentator John Motson to declare that ""the Crazy Gang have beaten the Culture Club.""

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN)  -- South Africa has refused the Dalai Lama a visa to attend an international peace conference in Johannesburg this week, a presidential spokesman said. The Dalai Lama fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. The Tibetan spiritual leader and Nobel Laureate did not receive a visa because it was not in South Africa's interest for him to attend, said Thabo Masebe. South Africa thinks that, if the Dalai Lama attended the conference, the focus would shift away from the 2010 World Cup -- the global soccer championship it will host next year. ""We cannot allow focus to shift to China and Tibet,"" Masebe said, adding that South Africa has gained much from its trading relationship with China. The Dalai Lama's fellow laureate, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said he would boycott the event.  Watch the controversy surrounding South Africa's decision » . Former president F.W. De Klerk, another laureate, backed Tutu, saying in a statement that he would also not participate in the conference if the Dalai Lama remained excluded. De Klerk said that the decision to refuse the visa made a ""mockery"" of the peace conference. ""The decision to exclude the Dalai Lama is irreconcilable with key principles on which our society is based including the principles of accountability, openness and responsiveness and the rights to freedom of expression and free political activity,"" he said. ""South Africa is a sovereign constitutional democracy and should not allow other countries to dictate to it regarding who it should, and should not admit to its territory - regardless of the power and influence of the country."" A representative of the Dalai Lama said he was not surprised by the decision. The Tibetan government in exile thinks that China has pressured many countries to refuse a visit by the Dalai Lama, according to Chhime Chhoekyapa, an aide in Dharamsala, India. The Dalai Lama fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. The peace conference was billed as an opportunity to showcase South Africa's role as a human-rights champion ahead of its hosting of soccer's World Cup next year. It was to bring together Noble Laureates and top soccer officials. In addition to Tutu and De Klerk, laureates Nelson Mandela and Martti Ahtisaari, Sepp Blatter, president of soccer's international governing body, and actress Charlize Theron were invited to attend. The event had the blessing of the Nobel Committee.","Spokesman: ""Not in South Africa's interest for him (Dalai Lama) to attend""

"(CNN) -- More than 2,100 registered North Carolina sex offenders were found on the social networking site MySpace, the state attorney general's office said Tuesday. North Carolina bans sex offenders within the state from social networking sites where children are members. In response to a subpoena from state Attorney General Roy Cooper, ""MySpace turned over the names, IP and e-mail addresses of 2,116 convicted North Carolina sex offenders found on its social networking Web site,"" Cooper's office said in a written statement. Cooper has requested similar information from Facebook, another popular social networking site, the statement said. MySpace has told North Carolina authorities that the sex offenders it identified have been removed from the site. North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation is sharing the sex offenders' information with all 100 sheriffs in the state, Cooper's office said. ""It's no secret that child predators are on these Web sites,"" Cooper said in the statement. ""Turning over information about these predators to law enforcement helps, but MySpace, Facebook and other social networks need to do much more to protect kids online."" North Carolina passed a law last year banning sex offenders within the state from social networking sites where children are members, making it a felony offense. Sex offenders on social networking sites is not a new issue. Last month, Newsweek magazine reported that Facebook said it had removed 5,585 convicted sex offenders from its site between May 2008 and January 2009. MySpace also announced it had removed 90,000 sex offenders in a two-year period, the magazine said. Last June, the Texas attorney general's office said it had arrested seven convicted sex offenders who violated their parole conditions by creating MySpace profiles, according to an article on the TechNewsWorld Web site. Cooper and Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's attorney general, for more than three years have led a group of attorneys general in working to make social networking safer, Cooper's office said. The group is pushing social networks to use technology such as age and identity verification to better protect users who may be children. After discussions with the group, MySpace became the first social networking site to develop technology aimed at finding and removing sex offenders, the North Carolina statement said. Cooper is pushing Facebook to take similar steps. But, Cooper's office said, ""the information provided by MySpace does not include sex offenders who have not been convicted, are not registered or may be using aliases on the site. Cooper remains concerned about other sex offenders on the site who may be lying about who they are, and is continuing to ask MySpace to do more to protect children on the site.""","Site provided names, IP and e-mail addresses of offenders it found, AG says .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- They could probably smell him coming for miles. Circus performers Andrea and Daniel Raffo with their son, Davian. ""Breakfast, boys,"" Daniel Raffo proclaimed as his cats jumped with excitement in their cages. Raffo set down his wheelbarrow, filled with Grade A beef. Using a pitchfork, he fed his Bengal tigers. It's the morning ritual at Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Raffo is the show's tiger trainer. He's a fifth-generation circus performer from Argentina. On this morning, the show awakes in Miami, Florida. ""You get up in the morning; you wash the animal, clean it up; you feed them, then you play with them a bit,"" Raffo said. ""And then during the day, you spend some time with your family."" He lives in a trailer with his family so he can stay close to the tigers. He, wife Andrea and son Davian are all on a two-year tour with Ringling Bros. But why would anyone live on the road like this, with a 4-year-old? Andrea is also part of the circus, performing an aerial ballet, hanging by her hair high above the crowds, just like her mother and grandmother, who taught her the act. ""I can finish my act and then go up and see my son, so it's good, 'cause we're always together,"" Andrea Ayala Raffo said. The Raffos keep a home in Florida but are rarely there. ""Home is actually my trailer, when we travel, and have dinner every night and watch TV. That's really my home,"" Andrea Raffo said. And these lives on wheels come with real family needs. Just outside Section 405 at Miami's American Airlines arena, across from the Mexi-go Taqueria and Nacho Time food stands, school is in session. Jonathan Leiss is a licensed teacher with the circus. He uses a nationally recognized home-schooling curriculum. He pitches a one-room schoolhouse in every city where the show pitches its tent, for all of the school-age children of the circus. School is open five days a week. He teaches all the subjects, and every one of his students gets personal attention. ""I would describe it as a rigorous curriculum,"" he said. ""We don't want to allow anything to slip through the cracks because we're traveling. This is a real school."" Leiss added, ""If I was teaching in a public high school, I could have 120 students. That's a lot less opportunity to really address what each student needs."" Katherine Stuart is one of the students. The 8-year-old is growing up quickly, surrounded by circus people from 32 countries. One of the performers is teaching her Spanish. She says she likes to wash the elephants, and she loves the travel. ""You can see all these different places and what it looks like, and I also wanted to know what each state looked like, so I get to do it,"" she said. Katherine's dad is Mike Stuart, the general manager. With his wife, Mary, and son Tylar, 3, he hits about 36 cities a year. When CNN arrived at his temporary office at the Miami arena, Katherine was reading with Mike. Tylar was with Mom, playing a ""Blues Clues"" game on the computer. ""This is a 24/7 job, so I make time pretty much every day to sit with my kids, go out with my kids,"" Mike Stuart said. The Stuarts, like most of the 350 circus members, live on a train, with all of a home's amenities. But finding a park or a playground is a must for them. ""I have a house in Massachusetts. I probably see it once a year, maybe for a week or two,"" Stuart said. ""But, more or less, we travel on the train. It's year-round, basically. ... So really, home is wherever the circus takes me."" One disadvantage is that the kids do not have a lot of friends to play with. But the family is always together. ""I think there's a lot of people who travel for their jobs, that are not fortunate enough to travel with family, where this job allows us to be able to do that,"" Mary Stuart said. The Stuarts believe that their lives and the lives of their children have been enhanced by the real-world learning experiences. ""Instead of just reading it in books, they're going to see these things, and to me, that's more fulfilling,"" Mike Stuart explained. Citing privacy reasons, the circus did not allow CNN to see the train. With any traveling family, there will inevitably be spiritual needs. Sister Dorothy Fabritze is a full-time circus worker and Catholic nun who holds religion classes, working across cultures, sharing the circus lifestyle. ""I saw that these people needed to find that they too were a parish, that they too were a community,"" she explained. ""We can support and walk with each other in this journey that we call life."" Fabritze arranges for clergy to visit the circus weekly. She's a former missionary who spent 16 years in Papua New Guinea. Here, she says, she hopes to be a biblical presence amid the glitzy backdrop and colorful characters, from acrobats to clowns to animal trainers. ""Some come asking for Bible study. We'll do that. Some come forward and say, 'My child needs the sacrament, with confession and communion. Can you help me?' Of course I can,"" she explained. For about two years, Fabritze also worked backstage, opening and closing the curtain between acts, for 800 shows in two years. She remembers those times as ""God moments."" ""They knew that I'd be there, and they would just come over and in the darkened area just talk to me about whatever they wanted to talk, and wonderful things happened. Wonderful spiritual things happened, just because I was there,"" she said. And although things may sometimes seem, quite literally, a bit upside down here, it's just life under the big top at the greatest show on Earth.","Dad is a tiger tamer, Mom hangs by her hair, and they travel with son .

"(CNN) -- The operation on Ronaldo's injured left knee ""went well"" but the Brazilian striker faces a lengthy rehabilitation as he bids to save his football career. Ronaldo leaves the field in agony after suffering his latest injury blow against Livorno. Ronaldo had surgery in Paris on Thursday, the two-hour operation perfomed by Dr. Eric Rolland with Dr. Gerard Saillant, who carried out a similar repair to his right knee in 2000, in attendance. ""The operation went well,"" said Saillant. ""The intervention was of the same type as the one in 2000. The healing period should last nine months,"" he said in sports paper L'Equipe. Ronaldo was injured playing for AC Milan in a 1-1 draw with Liverno on Wednesday night and teammate Clarence Seedorf gave CNN a graphic description of the incident. ""It was like a film I already saw,"" said the Dutch star who was on the pitch when Ronaldo suffered his previous serious injury. ""I saw his reaction, I was frozen by the reality, a bad, bad thing. My heart went out to him because it was his second injury. I hope he has the will to come back,"" added Seedorf. Ater the two-hour operation at Pitie-Salpetriere hospital, the three-time FIFA World Player of the Year is likely to need about 10 days of physical therapy, L'Equipe said. Ronaldo, 31, has battled serious injuries throughout his career, and has played sparingly since joining Milan from Real Madrid in January 2007. Wednesday's match was only his fifth in Serie A this season after injuring his thigh during preseason training on July 31. He returned in November, but has been in and out of the team due to a series of recurring problems.

"(Parenting) -- How to weigh whether to have another child -- and what to know about raising an ""only"" Couples feel more pressure to have second child than first, says one expert. My husband and I decided to be a one-child family long before our son Oliver was born. With several years of reproductive-health scares behind me, conceiving a child felt like a Powerball win; I didn't need another chance at the jackpot. Scott thought we could avoid the inevitable slings and arrows of sibling warfare. We both hail from large families, in which continuation of the family name is assured through siblings and cousins. We were content with our decision, and our families took it well, too. A few months after Oliver was born, I bagged up my maternity clothes for a tag sale, and Scott started researching permanent birth-control options. But one afternoon while absentmindedly sorting through blue and green baby clothes, the thought hit me like a punch: ""I'll never sort through pink clothes."" For years I'd imagined myself the mom of a daughter. After all, it had been a popular refrain throughout my adolescence (""I'll never tell my daughter what I think about her clothes,"" I'd intone to my mother). And I secretly hoped that my daughter would continue the tradition of attending my all-women alma mater. It wasn't that I was disappointed with a son. To be honest, I was relieved the day we found out we were having a boy because I could work the experience of being the older sister to three younger brothers to the fullest. Hearing the door clang shut on my fantasy daughter, however, made me doubt. When acquaintances asked, ""So, are you having any more?"" my voice quivered when I answered no. A woman in my local mothers' group worried aloud, ""How would you feel if something happened to Oliver and you didn't have any more children?"" Did I really need another child as an insurance policy? One night when the anxiety felt particularly overwhelming, I asked Scott, ""Is it okay if we hold off on that vasectomy for a while?"" ""It's normal to wonder if you're making the right choices and decisions, no matter how many kids you have,"" says Susan Jeffers, Ph.D., author of I'm OK, You're a Brat! Setting the Priorities Straight and Freeing You From the Guilt and Mad Myths of Parenthood. ""Even if you decided to have two or more children, you'd wonder if your life would have been easier with only one child."" Choosing to have one . Haseena Correia of Valley Stream, New York, mom to Zachary, 2, has long planned to have one child. ""Once I understood how much work it takes to have a career and raise a child at the same time, I pretty much decided one was all I could handle,"" she says. Correia says being a one-child family allows her the right balance. ""It gives me the joy of being a mother, but it's not too overwhelming to the point where I don't have any time for myself or my husband,"" she says. Financial barriers were also a factor in their decision. ""With a mortgage, skyrocketing taxes, and two cars, we have to be a two-income family. Having another child is financially just not an option for us,"" she says. At some point, parents will need to ponder: . • Can we cope emotionally and physically with another child? • How will we juggle another child with our jobs? • Where do we want to be in three years? Five? • How will another child affect our finances? What about our marriage? • If we wait any longer to decide, will our choices be limited by our age? There are social and emotional pressures to consider, too. ""If your friends are having second -- and third -- children, you can feel left out,"" says Susan Newman, Ph.D., author of Parenting an Only Child. ""Or you or your spouse may want more kids, but the other doesn't."" Sorting out our feelings on most of these things was actually easy for me and Scott. (It was the emotional pull that gave me second thoughts.) We have similar goals for the future, and we realized that with our temperaments, one child would be best for our marriage. We're happy for our friends who are having second and third children, but for us, Oliver completes our family. When you don't have a choice . Sometimes the twists and turns of life narrow your choices or eliminate them completely. Jennifer Lawler of Eudora, Kansas, always thought having four kids sounded perfect. But when her daughter Jessica was born with life-threatening health problems and Lawler's uterine fibroids compromised future pregnancies, she and her husband knew Jessica would be their only child. Lawler says, ""Raising our daughter was going to take a lot of emotional, physical, and financial resources. If I had any more children, I didn't think I could handle it."" Time made the situation easier. ""It's a process of acceptance,"" says Lawler. ""One thing that was helpful for me was not to focus on the past or the future. I put my energy toward making this the brightest moment. There were times when we thought Jessica wouldn't live, talk, or walk. She's done all those things, so I feel relief and gratitude."" Answering to everyone . As you work out what's best for your family, you'll face some tough questions all around: . • From yourself:  Laura Miller of Ottawa, Kansas, mom to Emma, 6, is undecided about having more children. ""If finances and circumstances ever allow, we might have another child,"" she says. ""But we're happy the way our family is now."" She admits she still has fears. ""My husband and I both have brothers and sisters --I can't imagine not having them to lean on. But after we're gone, Emma will be alone."" In my darkest moments, I've been known to worry about the unthinkable: With no other children, what would I do if I lost Oliver? But, of course, parents of onlies don't own the front and center on worry. ""Parents fear for all their children,"" says Newman. ""Families with a number of children are equally devastated and blown apart when a child dies -- the pain is no less just because you have others."" We need to accept that something so dramatic as death is highly unlikely and try not to live our lives in a state of anxiety. • From others:  ""The pressure to have a second child is often greater than for the first,"" says Newman. But the fact is that the friends, family, and even strangers who are exerting pressure aren't the ones who'll be caring for these future children till they reach adulthood. After Lawler's daughter was born, she answered her questioners with ""We're going to take care of Jessica."" Sometimes intrusive questions and opinions can drive us nuts, which is why it can be helpful to look within before lashing out. ""When you are affected by this pressure, it means you're looking for that person's approval,"" says Jeffers. ""Ask yourself, 'Why am I reacting this way? Am I afraid of criticism from this person?' As soon as you stop needing their approval, you can relax and appreciate the decision you made."" Once a mom is feeling calmer, she can answer the critics with, say, ""I understand you really want this, but it's not right for me"" or ""Well, thanks for passing on your ideas."" • From your child -- it happens: Many onlies will ask -- loudly, often -- for a little brother or sister, or wonder aloud why they're stuck being an only child. A straightforward answer is the best bet, says Lise Youngblade, Ph.D., associate director of the Institute for Child Health Policy at the University of Florida in Gainesville. ""The last thing parents want to do is get into a negotiation,"" she says. Instead, respond with something like ""We've decided that our family size is just right. There are lots of different kinds of families, and this is how ours is."" With an older child, you can point out that many of the advantages he enjoys as an only -- his own specially decorated bedroom, for instance, or the one-on-one time he has with Mom and Dad -- may be things he wouldn't have with a brother or sister. You can also try asking your child what he thinks would be the benefits of having a sibling. It could be as simple as having a bunk bed. If a child's demands don't abate, Jeffers points out that ""children complain, period."" Parents with two or three kids sometimes hear, ""Mommy, it's time to send the baby back to the hospital."" In my case, it took me time to say goodbye to my fantasy daughter, but when Oliver was 18 months old, I finally said to Scott, ""Let's do it,"" on the vasectomy. I'm very happy with my son and our decision, and I've looked for other ways to indulge my daughter needs. I volunteered as a Big Sister and counseled a 15-year-old on boyfriends. When I spot cute girly-girl dresses, I buy them for my friend's daughters. And I console myself that when I go through menopause, there won't be two hormonal women under this roof.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The chairman of India's UB Group, which includes Bangalore-based Kingfisher Airlines and United Breweries, made the winning $1.8 million bid on a number of Mahatma Gandhi's personal items on auction. Mahatma Gandhi was known for his peaceful opposition to tyranny, which led to India's independence. Vijay Mallya was expected to return the items to the Indian government, according to CNN-IBN, CNN's sister station in India. Controversy surrounded the sale Thursday of Gandhi's items -- among them his metal-rimmed glasses, pocket watch, sandals, bowl and plate -- prompting the seller, James Otis, to ask that the items be withdrawn from the auction. India voiced strong objections to the auction. Its Ministry of External Affairs said the bidding would ""commercialize and thereby demean the memory of the Father of the Nation and everything that he stood for in his life, beliefs and actions."" On Tuesday, a New Delhi court issued an injunction to stop the sale.  Watch the auction stoke high interest » . But the Antiquorum auction house in Manhattan went ahead with the auction as scheduled. The Indian government had rejected an offer from Otis, who had asked the Indian government to expand its spending on the poor in exchange for the items. India's government already spends a large amount of money on the country's disadvantaged sectors, India's culture minister Ambika Soni told reporters Thursday. Still, the government had hoped Otis would not allow the public to bid on the items. Soni, the culture minister, said that India's government exercised several options to stop the auction at the Antiquorum in New York. Gandhi, who waged a long struggle against British rule in India, was assassinated in New Delhi by a Hindu fanatic on January 30, 1948. He is still widely revered for his insistence on non-violent protest to achieve political and social progress. Many Indians believe selling Gandhi's items for profit is outrageous. ""I feel very sad about it because Gandhi himself never believed in private possessions,"" said Varsha Das, director of India's National Gandhi Museum, using a term of endearment for Gandhi. ""He gave away everything. He did not even have a home to live in."" CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","Mallya expected to return items to Indian government, CNN-IBN reports .

"(CNN) -- The Georgia company whose peanut products have been blamed for a nationwide salmonella outbreak shipped some products even though they had tested positive for the bacteria and no other tests indicated they were safe, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday. The FDA confirmed Friday the Peanut Corp.'s Blakely, Georgia, plant shipped tainted product without retesting. Previously, Peanut Corporation of America had said it shipped products only after subsequent tests on them came back negative. Items made with its peanut products have been linked to more than 500 cases of illness, including eight deaths. The agency said the company's management told FDA inspectors last month during an inspection of the plant that they shipped products that first had tested positive for salmonella, but only if they later had tested negative. But, it said, ""FDA determined that certain information provided by PCA management during the inspection was not consistent with the subsequent analysis of the company's records."" As a result, the agency amended its report Thursday. ""In some situations the firm received a positive salmonella test result, followed by a later negative result, and then shipped the products,"" said the FDA report, which was included in an e-mail to CNN. ""In some other situations, the firm shipped the products [which had already tested positive] before it had received the [second] positive test results.""

"(CNN)  -- The Liberty Sun, a U.S.-flagged cargo ship bound for Mombasa, Kenya, was attacked Tuesday by Somali pirates, according to a NATO source with direct knowledge of the matter. Pirates attacked The Liberty Sun, a U.S.-flagged  cargo ship, but were unable to board. ""The pirates fired rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons at the vessel, which sustained damage,"" said a statement from New York-based Liberty Maritime Corporation, which owns the vessel. The ship was carrying U.S. food aid for African nations, the statement said. The pirates never made it onto the ship and the vessel is now being escorted by a coalition ship, still bound for Mombasa, officials said. Two senior defense officials said the Liberty Sun was being escorted by the guided missile destroyer USS Bainbridge. It is the ship carrying Richard Phillips, the captain of the container ship Maersk Alabama, which was hijacked last week. Phillips spent days as a hostage of the pirates before being rescued Sunday. Katy Urbik of Wheaton, Illinois, said her son, Thomas, was aboard the Liberty Sun at the time of the attack. She shared the e-mails he sent as the ship came under fire. ""We are under attack by pirates, we are being hit by rockets. Also bullets,"" said one e-mail sent Tuesday afternoon. ""We are barricaded in the engine room and so far no one is hurt. [A] rocket penetrated the bulkhead but the hole is small. Small fire, too, but put out. ""Navy is on the way and helos and ships are coming. I'll try to send you another message soon. [G]ot to go now. I love you mom and dad and all my brothers and family."" ""My heart stopped after I realized there wasn't going to be a 'just kidding' after his comment,"" Katy Urbik said. About 1½ hours later, Thomas Urbik sent another e-mail to his mother, which said, ""The navy has showed up in full force and we are now under military escort ... all is well. I love you all and thank you for the prayers."" In an e-mail only hours before the attack, Urbik's son tried to assure his mother that his crew was safe and taking precautions. ""Don't worry too much. I am fine and we are being well monitored by the U.S. Navy, who is demanding we send them a report every six hours on our position and status,"" Thomas Ubrik's e-mail said. He added, ""We in fact are going to be the second American ship to arrive into Mombasa after the Maersk Alabama. It should be interesting to say the least. ... We have had several drills to prepare ourselves to secure ourselves in the engine room. [W]e can do it pretty quick by now."" The company said the ship had dropped off food aid last week at a Sudanese port and the ship was going around the Horn of Africa to reach Kenya when it came under attack. However, the exact location of the attack remained unclear. Earlier Tuesday, pirates off the coast of Somalia seized two freighters, proving they remain a force to contend with just days after the U.S. Navy dramatically rescued an American captain held by other pirates. First, pirates in the Gulf of Aden on Tuesday hijacked the MV Irene EM, a 35,000-ton Greek-owned bulk carrier, according to a NATO spokesman and the European Union's Maritime Security Center. The crew of the Greek carrier was thought to be unhurt and ships have been warned to stay clear of the area for fear of further attack, the Security Center said. Later Tuesday, pirates on four skiffs seized the 5,000-ton MV Sea Horse, a Lebanese-owned and Togo-flagged vessel, said Cmdr. Chris Davies of NATO's Maritime Component Command Headquarters in Northwood, England. Details about the ship and its crew weren't immediately available. NATO has an ongoing anti-piracy mission off Somalia called Operation Allied Protector. The mission involves four ships covering more than a million square miles, Davies said. A U.S.-led international naval task force, Combined Task Force-151, is also patrolling in the region. Tuesday's hijackings came two days after sharpshooters from the U.S. Navy SEALs killed three pirates who had been holding Phillips hostage on the water for days. Phillips had offered himself as a hostage when pirates attacked the Alabama on Wednesday, officials said. The ship had been on its way to deliver aid to Mombasa, Kenya. A fourth pirate had been aboard Bainbridge when the shootings occurred and was taken into custody.  Watch the tough tactics the Navy uses » . The incident follows four freighters being seized over the past two days by pirates off the Somalian coast, proving they remain a force to contend with. Pirates on Monday hijacked two Egyptian fishing boats carrying a total of between 18 and 24 people, the Egyptian Information Ministry told CNN. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry is working to end the hijacking, the ministry said. Egyptian boats are known to use Somali waters illegally for fishing, taking advantage of the lawless state of the country and the lack of enforcement of its maritime boundaries. Those who have tracked pirate activity in Somalia say it started in the 1980s, when the pirates claimed they were trying to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast. Piracy accelerated after the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms. Those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions. Some experts say companies are simply making the problem worse by paying the pirates. CNN's Mike Mount, Barbara Starr and David McKenzie contributed to this report.","Crewman e-mailed hours before attack that Navy was monitoring the ship .

"(CNN) -- The Baptist minister who was fatally shot Sunday as he led services at a church in suburban Saint Louis, Missouri, was carrying out work he believed in fervently, a church official said Monday. The Web site for First Baptist Church of Maryville includes a photo of slain Pastor Fred Winters. ""I believe that he would want us to know that he died doing exactly what he believed passionately about,"" Worship and Music Pastor Mark Jones told reporters outside First Baptist Church in Maryville, Illinois, about Pastor Fred Winters, who was killed the day before. Jones expressed gratitude for an overwhelming response from the public that has included more than 1,000 e-mails of support. They will be compiled ""into a huge book of love"" to be given to Winters' widow, he said. Investigators have charged Terry J. Sedlacek, 27, with first-degree murder in the killing. Sedlacek was further charged with two counts of aggravated battery related to the stabbing of parishioners Terry Bullard and Keith Melton. Their wounds were not life-threatening, said Illinois State Police spokesman Ralph Timmins. Sedlacek himself was seriously wounded in the melee, Timmins said Sunday. Asked what led Sedlacek to the church, Jones said, ""We're scratching our heads on that one.""  Watch response of grieving church » . Jones said another church official visited Sedlacek's family on Monday. ""We wanted them to know that we're praying for them, we're praying for the attacker,"" Jones said. Speaking of Sedlacek, Jones added, ""Maybe he, too, needs to go back to the Bible and read the book and ask the question, 'Is this really God's word? Do I need to reconsider some things?' ""  Watch aftermath of shooting in church » . Winters and the gunman exchanged words before the gunman fired four shots during Sunday morning services, hitting the minister's Bible and then hitting Winters himself, said Illinois State Police Director Larry Trent. ""The only thing we know is that the suspect said something to the pastor, and the pastor said something back to him -- we don't know what that was,"" Trent told reporters Sunday. ""It was almost as if the pastor may have recognized him, but we're not sure about that at all."" Trent said the gunman's .45-caliber pistol jammed after he shot Winters. The man then pulled out a knife before being subdued by some of the approximately 150 worshippers attending the church in southern Illinois. ""When he was tackled by two of the members, we don't know whether he fell on the knife, injuring himself at the time, or whether [his injury] was self-inflicted during the struggle,"" Trent said.  Watch police describe ""heroic action"" of parishioners » . Trent said police were trying to determine a motive in the shooting, noting that church members did not recognize the gunman. Last August, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch profiled Sedlacek in a story it did about Lyme disease. His mother, Ruth Abernathy, told the newspaper he began acting strangely during his junior year in high school; he seemed confused and stopped participating in activities that had interested him. The newspaper identified him as a resident of the Troy, Illinois, in suburban St. Louis. Abernathy told the paper her son was initially diagnosed with mental illness and then later diagnosed with Lyme disease. Lyme disease diagnosis, effects and treatment has caused disagreement in the medical community. A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that mental illness associated with Lyme disease is highly unusual, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America said Lyme disease ""is not known to cause violent behavior."" But a study published in 2002 in the American Journal of Psychiatry and carried out in the Czech Republic found that 36 percent of 900 psychiatric subjects had antibodies to the bacterium linked to Lyme disease, versus 18 percent of 900 healthy control subjects. The Illinois shooting is believed to be the nation's first in a church since July, when a 58-year-old man opened fire in a Knoxville, Tennessee, church during a children's play. Two people were killed and six wounded in the shooting  at Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church. Jim Adkisson told police he targeted the church because of its ""liberal teachings,"" according to court papers. Adkisson pleaded guilty last month in a deal that allowed him to avoid the death penalty with a sentence of life in prison without parole, court officials said. CNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this story.","NEW: Fred Winters ""died doing exactly what he believed passionately about""

"(CNN) -- The mountain gorillas in a national park in Congo appear to be hanging on well despite such dangers as civil warfare and poaching, according to an ongoing census. Park rangers conducting the census in November. Workers have identified 75 ""habituated"" gorillas in Virunga National Park, three more than there were in the last census nearly a year and a half ago, said Samantha Newport, the park communications director. Habituated gorillas are those who are accustomed to contact with humans. They are easier to spot than non-habituated gorillas, thought to number around 120. Newport said the census should be completed by around January 20 and officials hope that more habituated gorillas will be identified. She said the fact that gorillas have survived amid civil war in the region is ""nothing short of a miracle."" Laurent Nkunda's Tutsi armed force that had been fighting Congolese soldiers and their militia allies has had control of large swaths of the 8,000 square-kilometer park. The gorilla section is in a strategically important area near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. Officials have long said that the 250-square kilometer gorilla reserve in the southern part of Virunga National Park is where around 200 of the world's 700 mountain gorillas live.","Census of mountain gorillas in DR Congo doing well despite war, poaching .

"(CNN)  -- The woman and children held captive in a cellar for years by their incestuous father will take years to recover from their disturbing ordeal, doctors warned Wednesday as the family at the center of the case remained in psychiatric care. The bathroom used by Elizabeth Fritzl, who was held captive for more than two decades, and her three children. Members of the Fritzl family will also be offered the chance to adopt new identities in an effort to help them lead normal lives, officials said. Hans-Heinz Lenze, the head of local social services said the family was ""doing as well as can be expected in the circumstances"" and said any change of identity would be the family's decision. Elizabeth Fritzl -- now 42 -- spent more than two decades in the windowless basement after being drugged, handcuffed and locked up by her father, Josef Fritzl, as an 18-year-old. Repeatedly raped, she gave birth to seven children by Fritzl, one of whom died as an infant. Three of the children -- Kerstin, 19; Stefan, 18; and Felix, 5 -- remained imprisoned underground with their mother. The other three lived in an apartment upstairs with Fritzl and his wife who believed Elizabeth had abandoned them after running away from home. Elizabeth and five of the children were continuing to receive treatment at a local clinic near Amstetten after being reunited on Sunday. Kerstin, whose hospitalization at the weekend finally brought the family's plight to the attention of authorities, remained in a coma at a nearby hospital. ""It is astonishing how easy it worked that the children came together, and also it was astonishing how easy it happened that the grandmother and the mother came together,"" clinic director Berthold Kepplinger said. But Kepplinger warned that the family would require extensive counseling. ""We're talking of 20 years of darkness, incest and its effects and other illnesses they might have suffered from."" Kepplinger said the two sets of children were tentatively getting to know one another, adding that the two boys who had lived underground had an unusual way of communicating with each other. A policeman who had accompanied the boys to hospital after their discovery on Sunday said the pair had ""screamed with excitement"" during the car journey as they experienced the outside world for the first time. ""The two boys appeared overawed by the daylight they had never experienced before,"" said Chief Inspector Leopold Etz. ""The real world was completely alien to them... We had to drive very slowly with them because they cringed at every car light and every bump. It was as if we had just landed on the moon."" In an interview with the Austrian newspaper, Oesterreich, psychiatrist Max Friedrich, who treated the abducted teenager Natascha Kampusch, estimated it would take ""between five and eight years"" for the children to recover from their experiences. Another psychologist, Bernd Prosser, told Austrian television that it would be impossible for the four held prisoner underground to lead normal lives. ""I am afraid it is too late for that."" Kampusch, the Austrian girl abducted as a 10-year-old and held captive in a basement for more than eight years until she escaped in 2007, also offered her help to the family on Tuesday, but questioned the decision to move them from the cellar into psychiatric care. ""Pulling them abruptly out of this situation, without transition, to hold them and isolating them to some extent, it can't be good for them,"" said Kampusch, now 20, in an interview with Austrian TV station Puls 4. ""I believe it might have been even better to leave them where they were, but that was probably impossible. This case is not like mine, where that was not my environment. They were born there and I can imagine that there is a strong attachment to that place."" E-mail to a friend .","Austrian family held captive in a cellar will take years to recover, doctors say .

"(CNN) -- More timely now than when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2008, ""Sunshine Cleaning,"" an agreeable, midrange independent film, makes light work of heavy burdens. Amy Adams gets to work cleaning up as Rose in the indie comedy ""Sunshine Cleaning."" Sisters Rose (Amy Adams) and Norah (Emily Blunt) struggle with menial jobs and periods of unemployment. Together, they're also coping with the nasty emotional residue of their mom's long-ago suicide -- a trauma that is likely responsible for their current troubles. Self-esteem isn't a strong suit for either of them. As ""Sunshine Cleaning"" dawns, they're both scraping by. If Norah is out of work before we've settled into our popcorn, she's not overly concerned by her situation. Rose, on the other hand, is desperate to graduate from cleaning other people's middle-class homes. It's not just that the humiliation of laundering for her old cheerleader team is getting her down; she needs the money to put her ""difficult"" kid (Jason Spevack) into the kind of school that will give him a chance. It's Rose's married boyfriend -- and old high school sweetheart -- Mac (Steve Zahn) who spies a new niche for the sisters. A homicide detective, he's watching the cleaning crew bag the blown brains of a shotgun enthusiast when he overhears the proprietor of the building grousing about the ""three grand"" it's costing him. Granted, blood and intestinal juices aren't everybody's cup of tea, but that kind of return sure beats washing Mrs. Johansson's drapes for $30 an hour. ""CSM: Crime Scene Maid"" isn't a job you're likely to find down at the employment office, but somebody must be doing the dirty work. Rose and Norah -- incorporated -- find that the stench takes some getting used to, and there's a whole new arsenal of cleaning fluids to master, but they get to work with a positive attitude and like to think they're doing their bit to put the world right. From this unusual setup, the movie might have skewed in any number of ways. The sisters might have uncovered evidence of corruption and murder, for instance, perhaps implicating Mac? ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is nowhere near so abrasive or generic as such a scenario. Written by Megan Holley and directed by Christine Jeffs (""Sylvia""), it instead puts a sympathetic, gentle comic gloss on the characters' fundamentally forgivable foibles and imperfections. Norah tracks down the daughter of one suicide (Mary Lynn Rajskub) to present her with mementos that should have been destined for the junkyard. Blunt's edgy performance keeps us guessing. Norah's a bit of a flake, but she's animated by her anger and her rebellious streak. If she's hard to read, it's because she's still young and doesn't know herself yet. Rose is easier to understand. She's determined to seize this chance to dig herself out of the hole and recapture the promise she used to see in herself. Adams has a knack for putting a brave face on things -- something about the way she tilts her chin up while her mouth goes in three directions at once. She keeps our rooting interest in Rose alive even when her choices seem misguided or naive. A subplot concerning Rose's son bonding with Joe (Alan Arkin), the sisters' lovable but infuriating father (you know the kind: He buys bulk orders of shrimp off the back of a truck) tips us too far into the realm of indie quirk. The character is a useful sounding board, and an amusing grouch, but it's just about impossible to imagine this man bringing up these girls. Ironically, for a movie that's marketed with the one-liner ""Life's a messy business,"" Holley's script has been polished to within an inch of its life. Emotions are experienced most vividly when they're raw, but in ""Sunshine Cleaning,"" feelings come filtered through neat-and-tidy grace notes. The film flirts with dangerous material, but it's too intent on putting the sunny side up to get its hands dirty. The way director Jeffs tells it, not only is suicide painless it can be positively feel-good. That's not to say there isn't a lot to enjoy in this well-acted and humanistic comedy. Buoyed by its up-and-coming stars and its optimistic message, it should do very nicely with discriminating audiences. ... It might even clean up.","Tom Charity: Up-and-coming stars, optimistic message buoy ""Sunshine Cleaning""

"(CNN) -- If a bed and 14 other antiques up for sale in New York next week look familiar, it might be that you saw them in a movie. An American Renaissance gilt, carved, inlaid and ebonized bed is expected to go for $500,000. Pieces of furniture owned by two very rich 19th-century Americans were destined for a trash pile before they were rescued for the silver screen. They will find new life on the auction block next week. Made by the Herter Brothers in the 1870s, the furniture sat in Warner Brothers' Hollywood props department since 1942, when the studio bought it at an estate auction for a fraction of the original cost. Warner Brothers, owned by CNN parent Time Warner Inc., could get $2 million from the auction, and it means valuable space will be cleared out in the props department storage. One studio source said using such expensive -- although authentic -- props on movie sets doesn't make business sense. Jon King, director of Bonham's, the New York auction house that will put the furniture on sale next Thursday, said he did not have the studio's permission to reveal in which movies the furniture might have been used. You can watch post-1942 Warner Brothers period films to find them. ""You have to go slow-motion and stop and start an awful lot,"" King said. ""I would imagine that if any of these were in movies they might steal the scene away from the actors,"" said King, an expert in 19th-century furniture. A New York Times article about the furniture, published in 1995, said it appeared in Warner Brother's ""Saratoga Trunk,"" a 1945 movie starring Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman. Few records were kept over the decades to track the pieces' appearances, a studio source said. King said he saw Herter Brothers furniture from the same estate in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" filmed in 1960 on Universal's lots. Universal bought its furniture at the same 1942 estate auction that Warner Brothers attended. The studio sold its collection years ago, King said. The furniture -- in American Renaissance and American Aesthetic styles -- was made with ""very exotic and very expensive materials"" for two very rich California men -- Gov. Milton Slocum Latham and railroad magnate Mark Harper, King said. The most dramatic piece is an ornate bed commissioned for the master bedroom at Latham's Menlo Park, California, home. It could sell for $500,000, King said. ""A lot of people in the field regard that as the finest bed ever made in the 19th century in America,"" King said. ""Basically, the quality of carving and the number of things going on in there in the bed, it's just amazing."" Changing times and tastes made the furniture obsolete for anything but a period movie by 1942. Movie studios were scouring the country for cheap furniture for their props departments, King said. But recent decades have see a steep rise in values for Herter Brothers craftwork, he said. King said next week's sale is significant for collectors because ""this is the last studio collection."" The Herter Brothers -- German immigrants who set up their furniture-making shop in New York City after the Civil War -- also made furniture for the White House, where some pieces remain.","The furniture was owned by two wealthy 19th-century Americans .

"LONDON, England (CNN)   -- Liverpool and England midfielder Steven Gerrard has denied assaulting a man during a nightclub brawl last month, a court in Southport, northern England, heard on Friday. Gerrard leaves court on Friday after pleading not guilty to actual bodily harm and affray. Gerrard, 28, issued a not guilty plea to affray and assaulting company director Marcus McGee, 34, at the Lounge Inn, Southport, after Gerrard scored twice in Liverpool's 5-1 win at Newcastle, reported the UK's Press Association. The Liverpool captain was charged with occasioning actual bodily harm and affray along with co-defendants John Doran, 29, and Ian Smith, 19. Dozens of photographers were kept back from the magistrates' court entrance in a penned area as Gerrard arrived in a dark blue suit. Nick Evans, prosecuting, asked for the case to be heard next on April 3 after a 10-week break to prepare it. But after submissions from the defense solicitors including Gerrard's, Richard Green, the magistrates adjourned the case back to the court at Southport on March 20. Gerrard, a father of two young daughters, spoke only to confirm his name and address and say he intended to plead not guilty along with the other defendants.","Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard denies assault charges in court on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Australian Tim Cahill dealt Liverpool a desperate and potentially damaging blow with the goal that salvaged a 1-1 draw for bitter rivals Everton and stopped the Reds returning to the top of the Premier League. Tim Cahill earned Everton the point they deserved with a header three minutes from the end to deny Liverpool. Liverpool had grabbed the lead when Steven Gerrard, captaining the Anfield club for the 250th time, swept home a low drive midway through the second half for his 14th goal of the season. But Cahill earned Everton the draw their contribution deserved when he met Mikel Arteta's 87th minute free-kick with a powerful header from inside the six-yard box. Spain striker Fernando Torres returned to Liverpool's starting line-up for the first time since November following hamstring problems, for the 209th Merseyside derby. And Torres should have broken the deadlock in the first half when he surged between Joleon Lescott and Phil Jagielka only to prod his shot against a post from a few meters. Referee Howard Webb was kept busy as the tackles flew in and he lectured Phil Neville, Joleon Lescott and Arteta after a series of fouls on Gerrard. Webb later refused Liverpool a penalty two minutes after the interval when Torres went down theatrically after being nudged by Jagielka. Everton believed they were entitled to a spot kick when Martin Skrtel looked to send Victor Anichebe tumbling. The referee again waved away the appeals, and the complaints were still raging on the pitch -- and the touchline -- as Liverpool surged away for Gerrard to crash home a 30-yard drive to put the hosts ahead after 68 minutes. It had been more than 10 hours since Everton had conceded a goal and it looked as though it would be enough to send Liverpool back to the top ahead of Manchester United. Cahill had other ideas -- and the sides will go through it all again on Sunday when Liverpool host Everton in an FA Cup fourth round clash.","Australian Tim Cahill denies Liverpool win with late goal as Everton draw 1-1 .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Police evacuated a major department store in central Paris Tuesday after finding five sticks of dynamite inside, French police told CNN. Paris's Printemps department store, which has been hit by a security alert, pictured last month. CNN affiliate BFM-TV reported the dynamite was not rigged to explode, but police did not immediately confirm the report. French news agency AFP said it received a letter in the mail Tuesday morning, claiming to be from an Afghan revolutionary group and saying that a bomb was at the renowned Printemps department store. The news agency alerted the police, who evacuated the store, AFP told CNN. The letter specified three locations where explosives had been placed, and urged the news agency to contact the police ""quickly or you will have blood on your hands,"" according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN which AFP confirmed was accurate. ""I assure you that this is not a prank,"" the letter said. The bomb squad found the dynamite around 11 a.m. (5 a.m. ET), police said. It is not clear if the explosives were found where the letter said they would be.  See where Printemps is located in Paris » . AFP said the letter was signed by a group called ""Front Revolutionaires Afghan,"" or Afghan Revolutionary Front. BFM-TV reported the group is calling for the withdrawal of French troops from Afghanistan by the end of February 2009. ""Make sure the message is relayed to your president of the republic that he withdraw his troops from our country (Afghanistan) before the end of February 2009 or we will strike again your capitalist department stores but without warning,"" the letter said. It is the second time in a week that AFP has received a warning about the store. The agency said it received a phone call from a similar Afghan group a few days ago regarding the store, but at the time, police chose not to evacuate. Printemps, one of France's most renowned stores, is popular with tourists and locals alike and located on the Boulevard Haussman. Most of the store reopened later in the day, although the area where the dynamite was found remained closed. Jim Bittermann, CNN's senior European correspondent based in Paris, said: ""These kind of stores at this time of year are absolutely packed with shoppers."" He added that France has a considerable number of troops in Afghanistan. In  August, 10 French soldiers were killed in fighting near the Afghan capital Kabul. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said earlier this year that his government was willing to commit more troops to the war in Afghanistan. ""We cannot afford to see the Taliban and al Qaeda returning to Kabul,"" Sarkozy said during a state visit to the UK in March. ""Whatever the cost, however difficult the victory, we cannot afford it. We must win."" Paula Newton, CNN's international security correspondent, said that the group involved was previously unheard of. ""This may be termed a hoax attack but it will cause real anxiety on the ground.""

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- William Potts picks up his daughters from school every day. People consider him a generous neighbor and a good father. William Potts smuggled a firearm aboard a flight, hijacked the plane and forced the crew to fly to Cuba. But few know how this eccentric American ended up in Cuba. ""I came to Cuba 25 years ago. I hijacked an airplane,"" said Potts, who was convicted of air piracy. Potts says he was enthused by Fidel Castro and his revolution. He imagined a racial and social utopia that could be replicated in his own country. In 1984, he smuggled a firearm aboard a commercial flight and forced the crew to fly to Havana, Cuba. No one was injured. ""In my revolutionary naivete, I came looking for military training,"" he says. Instead, he ended up in jail. He spent 13 years behind bars in Cuba. In 1971, the United States and Cuba signed an agreement in which each government agreed to prosecute hijackers or return them to the other country. Potts, who married after being released from prison, is now divorced and lives on the outskirts of Havana with his two daughters, ages 4 and 7. He makes some money letting his neighbors use his prized Internet connection. But the New Yorker is homesick and says his elderly parents need help. ""I committed a crime and paid for it,"" he says. ""Now what I want is to return home because I have to attend to my family.""  Watch Potts explain why he thinks he deserves a pardon » . He says the time is right. Potts wrote a letter to President Obama asking for a pardon that would let him return to the United States without fear of being jailed. There are thought to be 700 American fugitives hiding in Cuba. Members of the Black Panthers, Puerto Rican independence movement members and common criminals have sought sanctuary on the island. For the most part, they try to go unnoticed. Perhaps the most famous is black activist Assata Shakur, who was convicted for killing a police officer in New Jersey in 1973 but escaped from prison in 1979 and ended up in Cuba. Potts says he wants to leave behind his radical days and expects that Obama will finally allow him to do that.","William Potts hijacked a plane 25 years ago and forced crew to fly to Cuba .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations humanitarian chief Wednesday criticized a two-day pause in the fighting between the Sri Lankan army and Tamil Tiger rebels as ""inadequate."" U.N. Nations humanitarian chief John Holmes said he would have liked a ""proper humanitarian pause."" John Holmes, the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told reporters that the 48-hour break in hostilities was not sufficient, even as fighting resumed in the northeast of the country. The brief cessation of hostilities was announced by the Sri Lankan government on April 12 and allowed the U.N. and its partners to bring in necessary aid, said Holmes. He said he would have liked a ""proper humanitarian pause"" that lasted longer than two days, but hoped the break allowed for some progress to occur. Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon had originally welcomed the announcement by the Sri Lankan government. However, Ban also expressed his concern that, ""This is less than the full humanitarian pause of several days I had pressed for."" But Ban added that the pause ""is nevertheless a useful first step and an opportunity to move towards the peaceful and orderly end to the fighting now so badly needed."" The government of Sri Lanka has been battling the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) rebels in a civil conflict that has lasted nearly 25 years. The LTTE has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries, including the United States and the nations of the European Union. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the conflict officially began in 1983. The most pressing concern now, according to Holmes, is the fact that over 100,000 people are currently crowded in a ""very small pocket of land"" that is about five square miles, or about twice the size of New York's Central Park. ""It is a very small area indeed for what we believe is very large number of people"" Holmes explained. The crowded population, primarily comprised of Tamil civilians, is subject to the continuing Sri Lankan government assaults. The British and French foreign ministers released a joint statement as well on Wednesday, claiming that the LTTE is also using Tamil civilians as human shields. Holmes also called attention to the fact that the press has been barred from covering the civil strife in Sri Lanka. Ultimately, Holmes and the United Nations would like to see a peaceful end to the hostilities, but ""its pretty clear, frankly, that a ceasefire as such is not something available at present circumstances.""","U.N. humanitarian chief criticizes a two-day pause in fighting as ""inadequate""

"OXON HILL, Maryland (CNN) -- Crew members of the Maersk Alabama, safely back in the United States after being attacked by pirates last week off Somalia, recounted their ordeal Thursday. Navy personnel recover the lifeboat from which Maersk Alabama Capt. Richard Phillips was rescued Sunday. ""They start firing before they climb, with AK-47,"" crew member Zahid Reza said. ""I was scared for my life. I was almost close to that. And they tried to shoot me many times,"" he said, pointing to his head. ""Pointing gun all over. Here, there, in the back."" Pirates tried three times to board the U.S.-flagged cargo ship before their fourth attempt was successful, fellow crew member William Rios said, adding that the groups of pirates were different but that he thinks they were working together. Rios said he was working on deck when he was called back to lock down the ship. Then, he said, there were gunshots, and an alarm went off to alert all crew members to wake up and get on deck. ""We went to our training,"" he said, declining to provide details: ""If I tell you all what we did, pirates, they would know.""  Watch the crew praise their captain » . The pirates intended to ask for a $3 million ransom, Reza said. He said he and the ship's chief engineer took one of the pirates hostage. Reza said he persuaded the pirate -- whom he described as a young man, maybe 18 or 19 -- to trust him, pointing out that he is Bangladeshi and the pirate was Somali. ""His name is Abdul,"" Reza said. ""I told him, 'Trust me. I am Muslim; you are Muslim.' "" He told Abdul he would take him to the engine room to find more crew members. When they got there, the room was dark, he said, and he didn't know the ship's chief engineer was in there. He said the chief engineer jumped the pirate first, then Reza stabbed him with his knife, and the two men tied the pirate's hands and feet. Reza said he intended to kill the youth, but the chief engineer told him, ""No, we need him alive.""  Watch Reza talk about wanting to kill the pirate » . ""He was fighting me and chief engineer, to get away from us. A lot of yelling, shouting and screaming."" Rios said he went to the lifeboat, where Capt. Richard Phillips was being held, to exchange Abdul for Phillips but was unsuccessful. The captain -- who offered himself as a hostage in exchange for the freedom of his crew -- was rescued by U.S. Navy SEALs on Sunday. The SEALs, on the nearby guided-missile destroyer USS Bainbridge, fatally shot three pirates and rescued Phillips. A fourth pirate was arrested. ""I feel great they got killed,"" Reza said. ""I am happy."" He said he was proud of the Navy. Phillips arrived in Mombasa, Kenya, aboard the Bainbridge on Thursday. The crew arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland overnight.  Watch crew arrive in U.S. » . Rios said Phillips is ""outstanding; he's extraordinary; he's [a] very brave man."" Another crew member, John White, said they were ""damn lucky to be alive."" Rios called for more security in the Gulf of Aden. ""Put more military to patrol the waterway for us transporting material back and forth,"" he said. ""... All the countries got to get involved with this."" Reza echoed the call. ""I think government should get involved,"" he said. ""They should think about our safety, yes. ...

"(CNN)  -- A 23-year-old Mexican beauty queen and seven men were taken into custody late Monday after being found in vehicles containing weapons and cash in central Mexico, police said Tuesday. Laura Zuniga and seven men were found in vehicles with guns and $50,000, Mexican police say. Laura Zuniga and the men were traveling in two vehicles that contained AR-15 assault rifles, handguns, cartridges and $50,000 in cash, said Luis Carlos Najera Gutierrez de Velazco, secretary of public security for the state of Jalisco. The eight were stopped in Zapopan, outside Guadalajara, and will face arms charges and an investigation by a federal organized crime team, Najera said. Police, who had received a tip that a group of armed men were in a home, ""detected"" the vehicles as they were traveling to investigate the call, Najera said. One of the men in the vehicles was 29-year-old Angel Orlando Garcia Urquiza, who is Zuniga's boyfriend and the brother of ""one of the greatest capos of narcotraffic,"" Najera said. Najera said Urquiza's brother, Ricardo Garcia Urquiza, is a member of the Juarez cartel and already was in police custody. All eight were filed before the news media Tuesday. Zuniga, wearing blue jeans and a gray sweater, raised her handcuffed wrists to cover her face in a police picture. Zuniga is from Culiacan in the state of Sinaloa, a center of drug activity. In July, she won the title Nuestra Belleza Sinaloa. That gave her the right to compete two months later in the national Nuestra Belleza Mexico in Monterrey, where she won ""The Election of the Queens,"" one of five special recognitions, and came in third overall. In October, she won the title ""Hispanoamerican Queen 2008"" in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- More than half the Christian population has fled the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in reaction to a campaign of killings and intimidation, according to the United Nations. Christian women attend a religious service Sunday at a church in Baghdad. An estimated 13,000 Christians have left because of oppression the U.S. government blames on al Qaeda in Iraq. Mosul, in Nineveh province, is one of the last Iraqi cities where al Qaeda in Iraq has a significant presence and routinely carries out attacks. An estimated 2,300 families have fled Mosul this month, but the exodus has started to ebb, Nineveh province's Deputy Gov. Khasro Goran said Tuesday. No Christian family has left the city over the past seven days, and at least 100 families returned to their homes in and around Mosul during that time, Goran said. Authorities said they believe Christian demonstrations earlier this month may have prompted the attacks. Hundreds of Christians took to the streets in Mosul and surrounding villages and towns demanding adequate representation on provincial councils, whose members will be chosen in local elections in January. The violence that followed those protests left at least 14 Iraqi Christians dead and prompted the Iraqi government to dispatch more security forces to patrol the city. Violence has declined as a result, Iraqi officials said. Last week, U.S. Defense Department spokesman Geoff Morrell said the anti-Christian attacks and threats are partly ""due to elements of al Qaeda that still enjoy some ability to operate up there."" ""This is an attempt, it appears, to try to inflame tensions and fault lines that exist between religious and sectarian groups,"" Morrell said. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is helping many of the displaced families, most of whom have fled to nearby villages in Nineveh province. About 400 others have crossed into Syria, but many have said they no longer feel safe there, according to the refugee agency. Syria already hosts more than 1 million Iraqi refugees. The U.N. agency said many of the Iraqi Christians told stories of intimidation and death threats. ""One woman said she and her mother left Mosul early last week, two days after someone called one of her colleagues at work and said that all Christians should leave the city immediately or be killed,"" according to a UNHCR news release. ""She said she was unnerved but decided to leave only after hearing reports that 11 people had been killed at a checkpoint by militiamen dressed as police officers. She and her mother escaped with a couple of bags and all the money that they had in the house -- they did not dare go to the bank to remove their savings."" A nurse told UNHCR that the threats against Christians in Mosul began months ago ""with phone calls, letters and messages left on doors."" In other violence Tuesday in Mosul, four police officers were killed and four wounded when gunmen opened fire on their vehicle, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. Gunmen in cars ambushed police as they were on their way to start work in west Mosul's al-Amil neighborhood, the official said. Also Tuesday in Baghdad, six civilians died and 23 were hurt in four bombings, the official said. In eastern Baghdad, in the Shiite al-Baladiyat neighborhood, a roadside bomb exploded Tuesday afternoon, killing one civilian and wounding five others, the official said. Earlier, a parked car exploded near a busy outdoor market in the western al-Jihad neighborhood, killing at least five people and wounding 11 others, the Interior Ministry official said. No other details were available about the blast. Two roadside bombs exploded in central Baghdad's al-Nahdha commercial area, wounding seven people, the official said. The first blast hurt four civilians, while the second wounded three, the official said. Also Tuesday, the Iraqi army and police discovered 20 decomposed bodies in the basement of an abandoned house in Tal Afar, a town about 43 miles (70 kilometers) west of Mosul. There was no indication of how the victims -- who could not immediately be identified -- were killed, the official said. Authorities discovered the bodies after receiving tips from local residents. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities find 20 decomposed bodies in basement of Tal Afar house .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- After a week when he could not be traced, Egyptian striker Amir Zaki is back at his Premier League club side Wigan Athletic in northern England. Wigan and Egypt striker Amir Zaki has mended relations with his club manager. According to Wigan manager Steve Bruce the two have patched up their differences after he launched a verbal tirade against the 26-year-old striker. Zaki told Al-Hayat TV that the pair ""ended up laughing"" about his absence -- when he failed to return from international duty and had a hamstring strain which no one knew the seriousness of. But, it wasn't all laughs a week ago. On Wigan's club Web site, Bruce had said of Zaki: ""I just feel it's time that we went public on just what a nightmare he has been to deal with. I can honestly say that in all my time in football I have never worked with someone as unprofessional. ""I have already fined him the maximum allowed but this just seems to have no effect,"" Bruce said. After giving Zaki a fine for his misdemeanor the Wigan manager also revealed it was the fourth time he had gone AWOL after international duty. Are players selling their fans and clubs short when they go AWOL? How do you think should they be punished by clubs? Zaki's case certainly isn't the first high profile instance of a player going missing. Inter Milan striker Adriano sparked kidnap fears after failing to return earlier this month, following a World Cup qualifier in South America. It was not the first time the Brazilian had failed to report back to his club following international duty. After a two-week absence, Adriano later announced he was taking a break from professional football at a news conference in Brazil. He told reporters: ""I've lost the happiness of playing. I wouldn't like to go back to Italy, I want to live in peace here in Brazil. ""I don't know if I'm going to stay for one, two or three months without playing. I'm going to rethink my career."" Other notable cases include Nigerian forward Ayegbeni Yakubu, who failed to return to club duty at Premier League side Everton after the African Cup of Nations last year. When he returned to Everton,Yakubu was hit with a maximum £80,000 fine. Manager David Moyes said at a news conference at the time: 'Yakubu's back in it now. That episode has ended. He let us down by not coming back. But it's over and we've moved on."" German club Schalke fined defender Rafinha a record $1million for making an unauthorized trip to the Beijing Olympic Games and spending a total of 35 days away. One of the most bizarre examples was that of Moroccan defender Youssef Rossi, who surprised everyone when he returned to training at Dunfermline Athletic a year after having his wages stopped by the Scottish club. Rossi had previously gone AWOL from the club and returned to training with Raja Casablanca back in his homeland.","Egyptian striker Amir Zaki was AWOL after failing to return to Wigan .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A day before embarking on a trip to Latin America, President Obama described his planned talks with Latin American leaders as discussions among equals. President Obama refuses to criticize Latin American leaders. ""Times have changed,"" Obama told CNN en Español Wednesday. Referring to his planned meeting later this week with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, he said, ""My relationship with President Lula is one of two leaders who both have big countries, that we are trying to solve problems and create opportunities for our people and we should be partners. ""There's no senior partner or junior partner."" Obama and Lula da Silva are among leaders scheduled to attend the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago. Obama refused to criticize the leaders of Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador, who have taken measures to change their constitutions to extend their holds on power. ""I think it's important for the United States not to tell other countries how to structure their democratic practices and what should be contained in their constitutions,"" he said. ""It's up to the people of those countries to make a decision about how they want to structure their affairs."" Asked how he plans to interact with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a fierce critic of the United States who once described former President George Bush as the devil, Obama offered no criticism. ""Look, he's the leader of his country and he'll be one of many people that I will have an opportunity to meet."" Though he said he believes the United States has a leadership role to play in the region, Obama qualified that role, saying, ""We also recognize that other countries have important contributions and insights. We want to listen and learn as well as talk, and that approach, I think, of mutual respect and finding common interests, is one that ultimately will serve everybody."" Asked about Cuba, Obama, who recently eased restrictions on travel and sending money to the island, offered a prod and a carrot to Havana. ""What we're looking for is some signal that there are going to be changes in how Cuba operates that assures that political prisoners are released, that people can speak their minds freely, that they can travel, that they can write and attend church and do the things that people throughout the hemisphere can do and take for granted,"" he said. ""And if there is some sense of movement on those fronts in Cuba, then I think we can see a further thawing of relations and further changes."" Obama sought to distance his administration from that of his predecessor, noting that he plans to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where ""some of the practices of enhanced interrogation techniques, I think ran counter to American values and American traditions."" He said his team has spoken with the Spanish government about a Spanish judge's call for an investigation into the role of Bush administration officials in the detention of five Spaniards at Guantanamo. But he did not dwell on his predecessor's legacy. ""I'm a strong believer that it is important to look forward and not backward and to remind ourselves that we do have very real security threats out there."" Though the U.S. image abroad may have suffered in recent years, ""there's a reason why there are consistently so many immigrants to our country from Latin America,"" he said. Obama lauded Mexican President Felipe Calderon, with whom he is to meet Thursday in Mexico City, as having done ""an outstanding and heroic job in dealing with what is a big problem right now along the borders with the drug cartels."" He vowed that the United States can be counted on to help. ""We are going to be dealing not only with drug interdiction coming north, but also working on helping to curb the flow of cash and guns going south,"" Obama said. Obama described himself as ""a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform,"" and said he has met with the congressional Hispanic Caucus ""to try to shape an agenda that can move through Congress.""","Obama heading to Summit of Americas this week in Trinidad and Tobago .

"(CNN)  -- Archaeologists believe they have unearthed only a small fraction of Egypt's ancient ruins, but they're making new discoveries with help from high-tech allies -- satellites that peer into the past from the distance of space. The enclosure wall of the Great Aten temple in Egypt, as seen from the QuickBird satellite. ""Everyone's becoming more aware of this technology and what it can do,"" said Sarah Parcak, an archaeologist who heads the Laboratory for Global Health at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. ""There is so much to learn."" Images from space have been around for decades. Yet only in the past decade or so has the resolution of images from commercial satellites sharpened enough to be of much use to archaeologists. Today, scientists can use them to locate ruins -- some no bigger than a small living room -- in some of the most remote and forbidding places on the planet. In this field, Parcak is a pioneer. Her work in Egypt has yielded hundreds of finds in regions of the Middle Egypt and the eastern Nile River Delta. Parcak conducted surveys and expeditions in the eastern Nile Delta and Middle Egypt in 2003 and 2004 that confirmed 132 sites that were initially suggested by satellite images. Eighty-three of those sites had never been visited or recorded. In the past two years, she has found hundreds more, she said, leading her to amend an earlier conclusion that Egyptologists have found only the tip of the iceberg. ""My estimate of 1/100th of 1 percent of all sites found is on the high side,"" Parcak said. These discoveries are of no small significance to the Egyptian government, which has devoted itself anew to protecting archaeological sites from plunder and encroachment. The Supreme Council of Antiquities has restricted excavation in the most sensitive areas along the Nile -- from the Great Pyramids at Giza on the outskirts of Cairo to the carvings of Ramses II in the remote south. Antiquities officials hope the move will encourage more surveys in the eastern Nile Delta in northern Egypt, Parcak said, where encroaching development in the burgeoning nation of 82 million poses the greatest threat to the sites. Old and modern methods . Parcak's process weds modern tools with old-fashioned grunt work. The archaeologist studies satellite images stored on a NASA database and plugs in global positioning coordinates for suspected sites, then tramps out to see them. Telltale signs such as raised elevations and pot shards can confirm the images. As a result, the big picture comes into view. ""We can see patterns in settlements that correspond to the [historical] texts,"" Parcak said, ""such as if foreign invasions affected the occupation of ancient sites. ""We can see where the Romans built over what the Egyptians had built, and where the Coptic Christians built over what the Romans had built. ""It's an incredible continuity of occupation and reuse."" The flooding and meanders of the Nile over the millennia dictated where and how ancient Egyptians lived, and the profusion of new data has built a more precise picture of how that worked. ""Surveys give us information about broader ancient settlement patterns, such as patterns of city growth and collapse over time, that excavations do not,"" said Parcak, author of a forthcoming book titled ""Satellite Remote Sensing and Archaeology."" The vagaries of climate in the region make satellite technology advantageous, too. ""Certain plants that may indicate sites grow during certain times of the year,"" Parcak said, ""while sites may only appear during a wet or dry season. This is different everywhere in the world."" Archaeologists working in much more verdant climates, such as Cambodia and Guatemala, also have used the technology to divine locations of undiscovered ruins. They have been able to see similarities between the vegetation at known sites and suspected sites that showed up in fine infrared and ultraviolet images covering wide areas of forbidding terrain. ""For the work I do [in Egypt], I need wet season images as wet soil does a better job at detecting sites with the satellite imagery data I use,"" Parcak said. ""I can pick the exact months I need with the NASA satellite datasets."" Benefits of a bird's-eye view . Remote subsurface sensing has been used in archaeology in one form or another for years, though the term ""remote"" doesn't necessarily imply great distance. Typically, a surveyor has wheeled a sensing device over a marked-out area to determine what lies below. The sensing devices employ any of an array of technologies, such as Ground Penetrating Radar. They bounce signals off objects below the surface and translate the data into images that a scientist's trained eye can decipher. Multispectral imaging encompasses technologies that ""see"" what the human eye can't, such as infrared and ultraviolet radiation. Scientists have used it for years to study the Earth's surface for a variety of purposes. Until resolution of these images improved, though, the only way to produce a sharp image was to be relatively close to the ground. For those lugging unwieldy gear across jungle and desert, an effective bird's-eye view can change the world. It lets them leave behind the days and days of meticulous ""prospecting"" and get results from airplane-mounted sensors or, later on, a flyover by an advanced satellite. One of the most advanced is called QuickBird, which has been in orbit since 2001 and can provide high-resolution images of 11-mile-wide swaths. The satellite can collect nearly 29 million square miles of imagery data in a year, according to DigitalGlobe, which developed and operates QuickBird. The company, based in Longmont, Colorado, is working on an upgrade. WorldView-2, to be launched in 2009, will offer sharper resolution of visual and multispectral images than QuickBird, according to the company's Web site. In the end, though, a tool is only as useful as its wielder. ""Most of the advances have come through processing on the ground by end users such as Dr. Parcak,"" said DigitalGlobe spokesman Chuck Herring.","Sharper resolutions allowing scientists to use satellites to locate ruins sites .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reached an important milestone Wednesday in her quest to pay the debt from her failed 2008 presidential bid: For the first time in eight months, her campaign committee reported having more money in the bank than it owes. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's campaign committee reported owing $2.3 million in debt at the end of March. On a day most Americans were preoccupied with filing their federal income taxes, Clinton's campaign committee filed finance documents with the Federal Election Commission, reporting a total of $2.3 million in debts at the end of March, compared with $2.6 million in the bank. The nation's top diplomat has been steadily chipping away at unpaid campaign bills since suspending her White House bid in June 2008, when her debt peaked at $25.2 million. That amount covered $12 million owed to vendors, as well as the $13.2 million she loaned her campaign from personal funds. Clinton's campaign was unable to repay that personal loan by the time the Democratic National Convention convened in Denver, Colorado, last August, the deadline mandated by the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance law. The former New York senator was forced to forgive the entire loan amount. Her campaign owed $6.4 million to 16 creditors at the end of November; $5.9 million to five creditors at the end of December; and the current $2.3 million owed to just one creditor at the end of March. That creditor is Penn, Schoen & Berland, a political consulting and polling firm that advised Clinton during her presidential bid. The firm's president, Mark Penn, was Clinton's senior campaign strategist until he stepped down last April amid revelations that he had lobbied on behalf of Colombia for a U.S.-Colombia trade deal that Clinton opposed. Penn remained involved with the campaign. Earlier this year, Clinton and her supporters raced to pay as much of the debt as possible by the time she was confirmed and sworn in as the nation's 67th secretary of state on January 21. As of that date, Clinton became subject to a federal law known as the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from personally soliciting or accepting political contributions. The Hatch Act allows others to keep raising money on Clinton's behalf, without her direct involvement. This week, longtime Clinton ally James Carville, a CNN contributor, sent a fundraising e-mail to Democrats on behalf of Clinton's campaign, requesting contributions of as little as $5 in exchange for a chance to win one of several prizes, including spending a day with former President Bill Clinton. ""I won't spend a lot of time trying to convince you to help Hillary,"" Carville e-mailed. ""I know what she means to you, and I'm sure you know how important it is for her to have her campaign pay off all its obligations."" It's unclear whether the campaign will use the $2.6 million in the bank to clear its $2.3 million in debts in the short term. Continued fundraising indicates that it will not. Additional operating expenses and other outlays could emerge. Any extra money from the campaign could be donated to political causes or returned to donors. Clinton's campaign reported raising $938,000 in contributions in the first three months of 2009. In addition to tapping traditional fundraising, the campaign also generated money by selling or renting various campaign assets to other organizations. It received $2.6 million from Clinton's ""Friends of Hillary"" U.S. Senate campaign committee for the sale of unspecified assets and an additional $2.2 million from renting out its lists of campaign supporters. Organizations that have rented Clinton's lists include the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the inaugural committee of then-President-elect Barack Obama, and the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation. Those organizations each paid $274,297. Clinton's political action committee, HillPAC, rented the lists for $822,492. Among the Democratic candidates who have rented Clinton's campaign lists are Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln; Virginia gubernatorial candidate and former Clinton campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe; New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who was appointed to fill Clinton's seat; and New York congressional candidate Scott Murphy, who hopes to succeed Gillibrand in the U.S. House.","Hillary Clinton owes $2.3 million in campaign debt from failed 2008 presidential bid .

On this month's MainSail programme, Shirley reaches the top of the tallest aluminium mast in the world - aboard the 56 meter Perini Navi vessel, Salute. The mast reaches a remarkable 250 feet (76 meters) into the air, and even with a small swell and light breeze, the top of the mast can swing through as much as ten meters -- five meters each side -- of its center point. Going up the mast is a dangerous job, but it is also a common necessity on any large yacht -- whether it be to check the rigging or complete a repair. Shirley has to wear all of the appropriate safety equipment for the climb -- which she has to do alone.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The YouTube and Carnegie Hall generations collided Wednesday night in New York City as a nearly sold-out audience looked on in amazement. Images from musicians' videos are projected during the YouTube Symphony Orchestra concert in New York. Almost 100 musicians from around the world -- the world's first symphony orchestra comprised of members who auditioned solely online -- played their debut gig. They may have forever changed the audition process in their journey. The YouTube Symphony Orchestra bore a new era of classical performance at Carnegie Hall, and according to a YouTube employee, that's exactly what they wanted to do. ""We hope this is game changing in the sense it redefines audition space, it brings people closer together and lets them collaborate, transcending geographical and linguistic boundaries,"" said marketing manager Ed Sanders. Participants were chosen from more than 3,000 YouTube video submissions from more than 70 countries and territories spanning six continents, according to a press release.  Watch orchestra play » . Their YouTube channel has received more than 15 million page views thus far with members hailing from more than 30 countries. The symphony orchestra's members participated in the three-day Classical Music Summit at Julliard and their Carnegie Hall debut served as the finale. Michael Tilson Thomas directed the performance and also served as the artistic adviser and conductor to the orchestra. He refined and nurtured each member through their musical selections online until the entire orchestra met in the real world a few days ago. ""For us it's somewhere between a classical music summit conference and a scout jamboree with an element of speed dating thrown in,"" Thomas said. While some participants traveled from as far as South Korea, Malaysia and Lithuania, bass player Kurt Hinterbichler lives in New York City. A theoretical physicist working on his doctorate at Columbia University, Hinterbichler was enamored at being chosen to participate. ""Carnegie Hall is still sort of the unofficial pinnacle of achievement of the classical music world,"" he said. ""You know once you've made it to Carnegie Hall you've really made it."" So, how do you get to Carnegie Hall? ""Upload, upload, upload [YouTube videos],"" joked Thomas, updating the old ""practice, practice, practice"" punchline. Violin player Jennifer Lindsay, who is a systems engineer by day, said she was floored when she learned she was selected. ""YouTube gave me this opportunity to perform at Carnegie Hall. There's no other way that someone like me who is not even a professional musician would have ever made it."" World-renowned composer Tan Dun created a piece especially for the orchestra titled ""Internet Symphony No. 1, Eroica."" Dun told YouTube his inspiration for this piece came from the streets of many international cities. ""On the streets of New York, London, Paris, Beijing, Shanghai, I heard the street noise...then I thought this is the spirit beyond, this is the spirit of today."" Dun has also created music for the movie ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and the Beijing Summer Olympics. The symphony orchestra played to a Carnegie Hall audience that was almost 90 percent of capacity. Audience members seemed to love not only the performance, but the idea as a whole. Peter Newton and his wife were on vacation in New York from London and decided to attend the concert. ""The mixture between the music and democracy... it's interesting that at the end of the day, you bring them together for this performance,"" he said. Aaron Polsky attended the performance in support of his sister, who helped organize it. He was amazed at how limitless the performance seemed. ""I think it's great... there are really no boundaries other than owning a computer and an Internet connection."" Musicians Lindsay and Hinterbichler both said they had no doubts the event would be a success. ""Absolutely do not underestimate the motivational power of playing at Carnegie Hall,"" Lindsay said. Hinterbichler agreed, ""We've got world class conductors, it will come together."" In the spirit of YouTube, Travis Threlkel designed videos that accompanied all 15 musical selections. The lights in the room changed from green to red during some segments to match the mood of the selection. Dun said he thought the concert would be a hit with the Internet community. ""The whole world tonight is Googling around what's happening in Carnegie Hall,"" he said. Hinterbichler said he still did not grasp the vast reality of the situation. ""It's going to be one of those life experiences you know. I probably won't know what it means until ten years down the line when I look back at it,"" he said. So, what will the folks at YouTube come up with next? ""There should be a live Internet performance [by the orchestra],"" said Newton, the audience member. After Wednesday night, that certainly seems like a possibility.","The YouTube and Carnegie Hall generations collided Wednesday in New York City .

"(CNN) -- President Obama visits Mexico with many issues on the table, but reinstating the ban on assault weapons in the U.S. isn't likely to be one on which the two countries can reach agreement. Mexican federal police officers this week display an arsenal seized near the U.S. border. Mexican officials say criminals use assault weapons from the U.S. in the violent border region. Mexican President Felipe Calderon and Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., say reinstating the ban would stop the deadly flow of weapons across the border. Under the Clinton administration in 1994, Congress banned possession of 19 military-style assault weapons. The ban was allowed to expire 10 years later during the Bush administration. Earlier this year, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said that Obama would like to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons, noting, ""I think that will have a positive impact in Mexico at a minimum."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last month that as a senator, she supported a measure to reinstate it. And the urban policy section of the White House Web site says Obama and Vice President Joe Biden ""support making the expired federal Assault Weapons Ban permanent."" Obama still supports reinstating the ban, as he did during the presidential campaign, but there are no plans to reintroduce it anytime soon, according to an administration official. Obama thinks more can be done to stop the illegal flow of weapons to Mexico within existing laws, the official said, noting that the president has taken steps to deploy more law enforcement to curb the illegal flows of drugs, weapons and cash in both directions across the border. The administration is unaware of any broad-based efforts in Congress to reinstate the ban, the official said. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told CBS on Thursday that reinstating the ban ""simply is not part of the plan that we're talking about here.""  Watch what Napolitano says about drug violence » . The Obama administration says the U.S. shares responsibility for the situation in Mexico, but as far as the ban goes, ""there's a lot on our plate,"" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said.  Watch what's on the table for Obama's trip to Mexico » . Gun rights advocates stress that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to own firearms without restriction. Gun control supporters interpret the amendment to mean that states shall keep militias but that an individual's right to own firearms may be restricted. Those who support the assault weapons ban as a way to curb violence cite figures from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that say American gun sellers supply the Mexican drug cartels with 95 percent to 100 percent of their guns. But others say that claim cannot be substantiated -- and argue that less that 20 percent of weapons used in crimes in Mexico are traced to the U.S. Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president and chief executive officer of the National Rifle Association of America, says U.S. rights are not the cause of Mexico's wrongs. In a commentary on CNN.com, LaPierre wrote that to believe U.S. freedoms are fueling the violence ""you have to believe these butchers and beheaders break every Mexican law they want except Mexican gun laws, which they honor -- while they break American gun laws."" ""Everything Mexico's murderous thugs are doing is already illegal. At issue is not the absence of law, but the absence of political will to enforce the laws that both nations already possess,"" he wrote. On the other side, however, there are those who say loopholes in America's gun laws fuel violence in both Mexico and the United States. ""We need to realize that the Mexican drug cartels are arming themselves here because our gun laws have loopholes so large that criminals and gun traffickers can easily drive gun-laden trucks through them,"" former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter of the late U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, wrote in a commentary for CNN.com. ""We need to prevent Mexican criminals and the traffickers who supply them from buying guns by changing our gun laws and strengthening U.S. law enforcement's ability to crack down on corrupt gun dealers."" On the eve of Obama's arrival, Calderon told ABC he thought the weapons ban was ""very good legislation."" ""During that period, we didn't suffer a lot, like we suffered in the four or five years,"" he said. And Sarukhan told CBS this weekend, ""There's a direct correlation between the expiration of the assault weapons ban and our seizures of assault weapons."" He said, ""We cannot determine how Congress and the administration will move on this. What we will say is that this is one of the instruments by reinstating the ban that could have a profound impact on the number and the caliber of weapons going down to Mexico."" Obama was to meet Thursday with Calderon in Mexico City ahead of his trip to Trinidad and Tobago for the Summit of the Americas. But Mexico isn't the only consideration when it comes to gun control. In the United States, gun control is a wedge issue -- and one that can carry serious political ramifications. Democrats tend to shy away from remarks that could be interpreted as anti-gun, especially in swing states and districts. (Remember the frenzy that ensued after then-candidate Obama said people in small towns get bitter and ""cling to guns or religion""?) Democrats are usually thought of as the party more likely to enforce ownership restrictions, while Republicans are associated with ownership rights. As a candidate, Obama promised, ""I'm not going to take away your guns.'' Any other message would have been unpopular in the traditionally Republican states he won such as North Carolina and Virginia. Other Democrats, such as Sens. Mark Warner and Jim Webb of Virginia, also are getting elected with the help of NRA supporters. Even so, with a Democrat in the White House and a Democrat-controlled Congress, there's been a surge in requests for background checks of potential gun buyers, according to the FBI, and some gun owners say they think restrictions are somewhere on Obama's to-do list. Asked Thursday if it's just too politically difficult now to reinstate the ban, Gibbs said, ""I think the president believes that we can have a greater outcome in the short term working to enforce the laws that are on our books.""","Mexico: U.S. ban on assault weapons would curtail flow of weapons into country .

"(CNN) -- Police in Boston, Massachusetts, are searching for a man suspected in the murder of one woman and the armed robbery of two others, all of whom, they say, he may have met through their Craigslist ads for personal services. Julissa Brisman, 26, was described as ""a really sweet, goofy, energetic kid."" Officers discovered New York resident Julissa Brisman, 26, unconscious with multiple gunshot wounds at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel on Tuesday night. She was transferred to Boston Medical Center, where she died shortly afterward. Police said Brisman, a model, offered massages via Craigslist, a popular online classified ad service. The confrontation between Brisman and her killer seems to have begun as an attempted robbery, police said. ""It appears that there was a struggle between the victim and the suspect in the threshold of the hotel room immediately prior to the shooting,"" the Boston Police Department said in a statement on its Web site. Police speculate the man may also be responsible for the recent robberies of two other young women who offered personal services via Craigslist. Four days before Brisman's slaying, a 29-year-old woman was robbed at gunpoint at a Westin Hotel in Boston. Police spokesman Joe Zanola would not disclose the details of her Craigslist ad but said she and Brisman were ""involved in similar professions."" On Thursday night at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, according to Warwick's police chief, Col. Stephen McCartney. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, according to McCartney. He said that no conclusions could be made but allowed that the incident ""may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area."" Matthew Terhune, a photographer who met Brisman when he took pictures of her for a calendar last year, described her as ""just a really sweet, goofy, energetic kid."" He added that she was enrolled in Alcoholics Anonymous and was contemplating counseling fellow recovering addicts. He had been unaware of her side job as an Internet masseuse. Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blond man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, said the Boston Police Department, which is asking the public's help in identifying the man.

"NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Is cheese the answer for Cayuga County, New York? Larry Rosenbaum surveys the field where he hopes to build a high-end specialty cheese factory. Like small towns all across America, this agricultural community is suffering, with unemployment approaching 10 percent. Entrepreneur Larry Rosenbaum thinks he can do his part to turn things around. For a decade, the insurance man by trade has been dreaming of building a factory for high-end specialty cheese. One key selling point: His product would meet the strictest standards of the Jewish and Muslim faiths. Rosenbaum says the demand for kosher and halal cheese is high but the selection is slim. So he's been eyeing a plot of barren farmland between Aurelius and Auburn -- two Cayuga towns -- as the future home of a $40 million, 64,000-square-foot factory that would churn out feta and brie. The goal is for his company, Saratoga Cheese Corp., to produce 30 million pounds of cheese in the first year and distribute it domestically and internationally. ""It's the beginning of a trend of bringing back manufacturing industry to New York,"" said Rosenbaum. According to the Public Policy Institute of New York State, manufacturing in New York declined more than 30 percent between 1997 and 2007.  Watch Rosenbaum talk about his plans » . Rosenbaum estimates that Saratoga Cheese Corp. would bring 75 factory jobs and 150 temporary construction jobs to the region. Plans also include 50 yeshiva work-study students to be placed on participating farms. In addition, several rabbis and imams would supervise production. If Saratoga Cheese can get off the ground, it could mean a boost for local farmers like Dale Hemminger, who has agreed to supply kosher milk to Saratoga Cheese Corp. Hemminger says it could be a crucial new market for his milk. And though he was at first skeptical of Rosenbaum's plan, Hemminger says he admires Rosenbaum's vision. But that vision is still $10 million short of becoming reality. Rosenbaum has secured $30 million in government grants, loans and private funding, but needs $40 million before Saratoga Cheese Corp. can break ground. Given the recession, securing the final amount is proving no small feat. According to Bill Teator, a board member of Saratoga Cheese Corp., the best-case scenario is a combination of investment by a kosher dairy company and private lending. Teator says that though investors are confident about the business plan, the economic environment makes it tough to secure the needed cash. But support from local lawmakers is abundant. Republican state Sen. Michael Nozzolio is optimistic that Saratoga Cheese Corp. will find a home in his 54th District. And with an estimated $140 million in local revenue hanging in the balance, there's reason to hope. Recession or not, Rosenbaum is steadfast in his belief. For him, it's not a question of if the factory will get built, but when. ""We're not going to quit until we make it,"" says Rosenbaum. It's a persistence that is necessary in a recession that has proved legendary.","Entrepreneur has long dreamed of building high-end specialty cheese factory .

"MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- The lawyer for the main suspect in last year's deadly terrorist attack in Mumbai was removed Wednesday, delaying the high-profile trial that was set to begin. Soldiers patrol in Mumbai on the eve of the trial of a key suspect in last year's attacks in the Indian city. The trial start for Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, 21, is expected to be moved to Thursday as officials scramble to settle the lawyer issue. Kasab is thought to be the only one of 10 gunmen to survive the three-day siege, which killed more than 160 people in November. As the trial was to begin, the judge removed attorney Anjali Waghmare because she also was representing a witness in the case. Waghmare argued that she had no idea that the person was a witness in the terror case, and she was representing this person in a different case. But the judge declared that it was a conflict of interest. An Indian court appointed Waghmare two weeks ago to represent Kasab, and it was unclear who would replace her. Kasab demanded that his attorney be replaced with a Pakistani lawyer. But the judge denied that request and said that a Pakistani lawyer may be able to be brought in as a consultant from outside the courtroom. Kasab, a Pakistani national, faces more than a dozen charges, including murder, conspiracy to wage a war against the nation and terrorism. During the proceedings Wednesday Kasab seemed relaxed and smiled many time at the large crowd of journalists in the courtroom. Kasab also requested newspapers to be brought in so that he could see what the media was writing about him. Prosecutors last month accused him of trying to delay the trial by insisting that the 11,000-page document detailing the charges against him -- which was written in English and the local Marathi language -- be translated into Urdu, the official language of Pakistan. The court rejected his request. Wednesday's trial was to take place in a makeshift court set up in a jail where Kasab -- who has been communicating with the judge via videolink -- is being held. Indian authorities have long blamed the Mumbai attacks on Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based militant outfit, but the group has denied responsibility. The violence initially heightened tensions between the two nuclear states. India has urged Pakistan to destroy what it calls terrorist infrastructure in that country. The two nations are longtime rivals that have fought three wars since their independence from the British, and conducted countering nuclear weapons tests in 1998. CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report.","Main suspect's lawyer removed as she represents a witness in the case .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- After a week when he could not be traced, Egyptian striker Amir Zaki is back at his Premier League club side Wigan Athletic in northern England. Wigan and Egypt striker Amir Zaki has mended relations with his club manager. According to Wigan manager Steve Bruce the two have patched up their differences after he launched a verbal tirade against the 26-year-old striker. Zaki told Al-Hayat TV that the pair ""ended up laughing"" about his absence -- when he failed to return from international duty and had a hamstring strain which no one knew the seriousness of. But, it wasn't all laughs a week ago. On Wigan's club Web site, Bruce had said of Zaki: ""I just feel it's time that we went public on just what a nightmare he has been to deal with. I can honestly say that in all my time in football I have never worked with someone as unprofessional. ""I have already fined him the maximum allowed but this just seems to have no effect,"" Bruce said. After giving Zaki a fine for his misdemeanor the Wigan manager also revealed it was the fourth time he had gone AWOL after international duty. Are players selling their fans and clubs short when they go AWOL? How do you think should they be punished by clubs? Zaki's case certainly isn't the first high profile instance of a player going missing. Inter Milan striker Adriano sparked kidnap fears after failing to return earlier this month, following a World Cup qualifier in South America. It was not the first time the Brazilian had failed to report back to his club following international duty. After a two-week absence, Adriano later announced he was taking a break from professional football at a news conference in Brazil. He told reporters: ""I've lost the happiness of playing. I wouldn't like to go back to Italy, I want to live in peace here in Brazil. ""I don't know if I'm going to stay for one, two or three months without playing. I'm going to rethink my career."" Other notable cases include Nigerian forward Ayegbeni Yakubu, who failed to return to club duty at Premier League side Everton after the African Cup of Nations last year. When he returned to Everton,Yakubu was hit with a maximum £80,000 fine. Manager David Moyes said at a news conference at the time: 'Yakubu's back in it now. That episode has ended. He let us down by not coming back. But it's over and we've moved on."" German club Schalke fined defender Rafinha a record $1million for making an unauthorized trip to the Beijing Olympic Games and spending a total of 35 days away. One of the most bizarre examples was that of Moroccan defender Youssef Rossi, who surprised everyone when he returned to training at Dunfermline Athletic a year after having his wages stopped by the Scottish club. Rossi had previously gone AWOL from the club and returned to training with Raja Casablanca back in his homeland.","Egyptian striker Amir Zaki was AWOL after failing to return to Wigan .

The pirates held him aboard a lifeboat for several days in a standoff against the U.S. Navy. Navy sharpshooters shot and killed three pirates, freeing Phillips. The other pirate had been taken into custody. The captain's wife, Andrea, also spoke at his homecoming, calling it ""one of the happiest moments of our lives."" She said she was extremely proud of his bravery, but also acknowledged the captain would say he was just doing his job. ""I have always been proud to call myself an American,"" Andrea Phillips said. ""Today, I'm even prouder. To everyone who has been involved in this that made this day possible, I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Through this past week, having Richard back safe was all that my family and I ever wanted. Now our prayers have been answered, and we have a lot of people to thank."" The 53-year-old Vermont native was praised Thursday by engineer John Cronan, one of the 19 other crew members. ""He went above and beyond the call to ensure our safety,"" Cronan told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""I can't thank that man enough. He is the reason I'm here tonight.""  Watch Cronan tell King about the experience » . Asked whether she wants to see Cronan continue working as a merchant mariner, Cronan's fiancee said it was up to him. ""John and I have an agreement,"" said Heather Giardinelli, who works as a pharmaceutical marketing researcher. ""He doesn't tell me how to do my job, and I won't tell him how to do his."" Asked whether he plans to return to sea, Cronan said, ""Yes, sir. However, the Staten Island Ferry has become much more appealing.""","Capt.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Male singers regularly photographed wearing a hat are usually covering up a receding hairline. Jason Aldean has had six Top 10 country singles. His new album, ""Wide Open,"" is just out. But not Jason Aldean. He has a full head of hair, and wears a cowboy hat to signify his commitment to country music. The same is true for his well-fitting jeans and cowboy boots. It's a formula that seems to be working. The 32-year-old rising star has just notched his sixth Top 10 country single with ""She's Country,"" the lead track off his third CD, ""Wide Open"" (Broken Bow). We caught up with the Georgia native in his dressing room before a recent sold-out show at the House of Blues in Los Angeles, California. The following is an edited version of the interview. Jason Aldean: Definitely a cowboy hat in L.A. makes you stand out a little bit. CNN: It's a fashion statement in L.A. Aldean: It is! You've got to wear it with confidence, too.  Watch Aldean talk about his new album » . CNN: Are you nervous about your new album? Aldean: I wouldn't say I'm nervous. If you have an album that you're kind of on the fence about, then yeah, you would be kind of a little nervous. CNN: Have you ever had one of those -- or if you had, would you admit it? Aldean: When we went in to record the second album (2007's ""Relentless,"" which went gold), I think it was a good album, but I felt like I was under a lot of pressure recording that album -- more than the other two. You hear people talking about the sophomore slump and all that stuff, and so I think all that stuff sort of got to me after a while. Combined with being on the road 200 to 250 days [a year], I just didn't have that much fun recording it. I was exhausted. And so going into this third album, I just feel like mentally, I was back in the right place. CNN: As an artist, do you ever really think you got it right? Aldean: If at any point you're recording an album and you think it's the greatest thing that you've ever done, and you'll never be able to top it, then you should probably quit. Michael Jackson -- he made ""Thriller,"" so I can see why he might have said, ""I'm done."" But even he kept making records. CNN: Were you a Michael Jackson fan growing up? Did you moonwalk as a kid? Aldean: Of course! I had my glove and everything. Used to wet my hair so it looked like a Jheri curl. (Cracks up) CNN: Who else did you listen to as a kid? Aldean: Guns N' Roses -- the '80s rock stuff. Then I was into John Mellencamp, and Bob Seger and a lot of the Southern rock stuff -- the Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Marshall Tucker Band. I listened to a lot of different kinds of music. CNN: Are you finding that the economy has affected ticket sales? Is it harder to sell out shows these days? Aldean: I think everybody has kind of seen a little bit of a hit. We're no different. We've tried to make it more affordable for people to come to a show with lower ticket prices [most of the time in the $20-40 range]. Maybe go in and play a show for less money than we would normally go in to play a show for, just so people can afford to come out and buy a ticket. I mean, you're looking at 200 bucks if you've got a wife and two kids -- and then by the time you come there and buy a couple of T-shirts, or some drinks or whatever, you're spending three, four hundred dollars, and right now, people are a little hesitant to do that. CNN: What do you consider an expensive ticket? Aldean: If Elvis was still around, I don't know if I'd pay 80 bucks to go see him. I surely would not pay 80 bucks to go see me! CNN: From a financial standpoint, touring is more important to an artist than selling records these days. Aldean: The music industry is so different now than it was even when I hit the scene in 2005. If you go to Wal-Mart and you want a song, you've got to buy the whole album for ten bucks -- or you can go to iTunes, and if you want a song, you can pay a dollar to get it. So in return, the record label is going to make less money, which is us making less money to pay them back. The way it works is the record label basically fronts the money for us to record an album. As the money comes back in off of that, they take that and repay the debt that we owe them. So if they're not making enough to repay that debt, they're not going to keep us employed on the label for very long. CNN: As an artist, do you worry about that? Aldean: Oh, absolutely. I think every artist worries about that. As a consumer, I think iTunes is a great thing. As an entertainer, not so much. I would much rather have somebody buy an album as a whole. Bad thing about purchasing singles -- if you have an artist you like and you keep doing that, there's not going to be music enough for you to go and get, because they're not going to have a deal anymore. But who knows? Record labels may one day be out all together, and people may be making their own music and selling it on their Web sites. CNN: That seems to benefit established artists more than up-and-coming ones. Aldean: Radio's really accepted us, and proven that they're really going to play my stuff as long as I give them something good to play. Fans are coming out to the show, so I mean what more could I ask for? My original plan when I got started in this deal was just to be able to make a good living for my family and play music. I've been able to do that, which is all I've ever wanted.","Jason Aldean riding high with new hit, ""She's Country""

"Editor's note: Journalist Karl Penhaul spent several weeks tracking the gangs of the Mexican underworld, the corrupt officials who support them and the cops trying to halt the violence. This is the last of three exclusive reports. The first focused on the violent rules gangs live by and the second looked at  how gangsters are honored in death. Forensic investigators and federal police dig bodies out of mass graves in the desert near Juarez. JUAREZ, Mexico (CNN) -- Heat waves shimmer over the desert. A team of forensic experts clad in white overalls excavate three shallow graves. The sand gives up nine bodies -- seven men and two women. At least one of the victims' hands were cuffed behind their back. Others had been trussed up with duct tape. The stale stench reveals that the corpses had been dumped there several days earlier and were decomposing fast. That grisly find in mid-March came a week after thousands more soldiers had been deployed to Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. The arrival of the soldiers and more federal police agents had coincided with a short lull in the killings. Snapping photos of the scene from behind the police line was Lucio Soria, photographer for Juarez's main newspaper, El Diario de Juarez, and its sister paper, PM. PM is a perfect example of Mexico's so-called ""red press,"" newspapers that specialize in covering violence. Soria seems like a perfect ambassador. ""I've gone for a week and a half without taking pictures of dead people. I was thinking 'Hell, what am I going to do?' At this rate I'll end up taking pictures for the social pages,"" he said. Soria realizes snapping pictures of blood and gore may seem heartless. But he stays cheerful, cracking dark jokes with colleagues, all while listening to police communications on a radio scanner and searching for clues about where to find the next drug war victim. ""It might seem ugly, but that's our job,"" Soria said. He and fellow photographers have been busy in recent months. Last year, Juarez became the poster city for Mexico's narco-violence, with more than 1,600 gang killings.  Watch musicians play ""narco-ballads"" honoring hitmen » . This year, Mayor Jose Reyes is trying to turn a page on the killings and make Juarez a showcase for solutions. Military and federal police convoys patrol the streets around the clock. Cops armed with AR-15 assault rifles, identities obscured by ski masks, hang off pickup trucks that speed around in twos and threes.  Watch cops round up gang suspects » . Soldiers strike a warlike pose behind heavy machine guns mounted on American-made Humvees. Whether it's working depends on whom you ask and how hard you read between the lines. ""I think this is very effective because it closes transport routes for the movement of [cartel] personnel and weapons,"" said a state officer, assigned to guide us, at a federal police checkpoint. The officer, known only by his call sign Trojan One, seemed confident. The agent in command of the checkpoint was less convinced. ""Of course organized crime is trying to avoid us. I'm not sure what methods they use to operate. We don't know how they work,"" said the officer, identifying himself only as Aztec One. On another day we ran into a three-truck federal police operation staking out a house in a middle-class Juarez neighborhood.  See photos of police, gang life in Mexico » . The commander said his men believed they had made what he termed a ""major"" cocaine bust. When I met him they had already been waiting almost 24 hours for a judge to issue a search warrant. When they gained access they discovered some 500 half-gram bags of cocaine. In Juarez those bags sell for around $8. Now do the math, 500 half-gram bags at possibly 60 percent purity means around 150 grams of pure cocaine -- hardly a major strike in the drug war. Reyes' solution has been to hand the military all civilian police functions, even down to traffic control. Mexico's military has little experience in urban warfare, little experience in policing and has been unable to shake a decades-old reputation for human rights abuses. When I bump into Reyes at a transfer-of-command ceremony at city hall I ask him what he's doing about alleged corruption and complicity among politicians and businessmen, who permit the cartels to move their shipments and help launder the proceeds. ""My opinion in Juarez is that that kind of political corruption does not exist,"" he said adamantly. Two weeks later, in Monterrey, I caught up with outspoken lawyer Raquenel Villanueva. She knows a thing or two about politicians colluding with Mexico's mafia.  Watch how drug lords pay tribute to a highway bandit, looking for luck » . Mexican media have dubbed her the ""devil's advocate"" for her role in defending a string of senior cartel figures and their hitmen. Last year, she was detained for 90 days, accused her of being a member of the Gulf Cartel. She was freed without charge. Throughout her career, she's survived four assassination attempts and taken 10 bullets, two of them in the head. Her office is crammed with religious iconography: crosses, paintings of the Virgin of Guadalupe and a four-foot-high wooden statue of Saint Jude Thaddeus. Two bullets are encrusted in the effigy after the last attempt on her life in 2000. ""I know about official corruption and exactly who is doing what because my clients tell me,"" she said. ""To win the drug war you have to tell the Americans to take better care of their young people, tell them to stop being so cold and materialistic,"" Villanueva lectured. ""Then you have to end corruption and that means changing the government cabinets of half the countries in the world.""","Border city of Juarez last year had more than 1,600 gang killings .

"(CNN) -- An archeological team is set to break new ground in its excavation of an Egyptian temple where doomed lovers Cleopatra and Mark Antony may be buried. An excavation of an Egyptian temple my reveal where doomed lovers Cleopatra and Mark Antony are buried. A ground-penetrating, radar survey of the temple of Taposiris Magna and its surrounding area, west of Alexandria, was completed in March, following three years of digging, according to a statement from Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. Taposiris Magna is one of the ancient towns located on Lake Mariut, which is today called Abusir. According to the council, the radar revealed three possible spots of interest where a tomb might be located. Recently, the team discovered a large, previously unknown cemetery outside the temple enclosure. ""The discovery of this cemetery indicates that an important person, likely of royal status, could be buried inside the temple. It was common for officials and other high-status individuals in Egypt to construct their tombs close to those of their rulers throughout the Pharaonic period,"" according to the council. The expedition has so far turned up 27 tombs, 20 of them shaped like vaulted sarcophagi, and seven simple burial chambers that are reached by staircases. Inside these chambers, the team found 10 mummies, two of them gilded. Other discoveries include an alabaster bust of Cleopatra, and 22 coins bearing her ""beautiful"" image, according to council Secretary-General Zahi Hawass. The discovery contradicts some recent reports that describe her as unattractive, he said. ""Among the most interesting finds is a unique mask depicting a man with a cleft chin. The face bears some similarity to known portraits of Mark Antony himself,"" Hawass said. The love story of Antony and Cleopatra has been a favorite theme for writers and filmmakers. The 1963 Oscar-winning movie of the couple starred Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, who themselves became star-crossed lovers. Cleopatra ruled Egypt between 51 B.C. until her suicide in 30 B.C., following Mark Antony's naval defeat against Caesar's adopted son Octavian at Actium in the Mediterranean.

"(CNN) -- NASA scientists say new data provided by twin spacecraft analyzing the sun will help them more accurately predict how so-called solar tsunamis wreak havoc on our planet. NASA says new data on so-called solar tsunamis will help predict how they will affect our planet. The tsunamis -- powerful explosions known as coronal mass ejections, or CMEs -- produce solar cosmic rays that can interfere with technology, causing power blackouts and disrupting air traffic communications and cell phone networks. NASA says images captured by its twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or STEREO, spacecraft have enabled scientists to map the tsunamis in 3D to examine their structure, velocity, mass and direction. The solar ejections, its says, can release billions of tons of high-velocity plasma into space, producing a shockwave that generates cosmic rays which then plow into our atmosphere. These can create the brightly-colored auroras, more commonly known as the Northern or Southern lights, but also have more damaging effects, posing particular threats to spacecraft and astronauts. Solar physicist Angelos Vourlidas of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington said the new data from the STEREO craft -- launched into orbit in October 2006 -- will revolutionize the study of cosmic weather patterns. ""Before this unique mission, measurements and the subsequent data of a CME observed near the sun had to wait until the ejections arrived at Earth three to seven days later,"" he said in statement. ""Now we can see a CME from the time it leaves the solar surface until it reaches Earth and we can reconstruct the event in 3D directly from the images.""","NASA says new data will enable scientists to map solar tsunamis in 3D .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The U.S. State Department threw aside diplomatic language Tuesday, attacking Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for creating what it calls a ""catastrophe"" by throwing many international aid workers out of the country. President Omar al-Bashir ordered the expulsion of aid groups after he was indicted on war crimes charges. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a direct challenge to Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir Tuesday, warning that he and his government ""will be held responsible for every single death that occurs in"" the refugee camps of the Darfur region. Al-Bashir ordered the expulsion of 13 international aid groups from the Sudan earlier this month after he was indicted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes. While other aid groups remain in Sudan, the United Nations said the 13 expelled groups provided roughly half the assistance delivered in Darfur. Nearly 300,000 people have died in the Darfur conflict, and millions are homeless, according to the U.N. Calling the situation in Darfur ""horrendous,"" Clinton said President Obama's administration will appoint a special envoy for Sudan ""in the coming days."" On Wednesday, retired Air Force Gen. J. Scott Gration was appointed as U.S. special envoy for Sudan, the White House announced in a written statement. ""Sudan is a priority for this administration, particularly at a time when it cries out for peace and for justice. The worsening humanitarian crisis there makes our task all the more urgent,"" President Barack Obama said in the statement. ""General Gration's personal and professional background, and his service to the country as both a military leader and a humanitarian, give him the insights and experience necessary for this assignment."" Gration, a former fighter pilot, served as assistant deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for international affairs. Fluent in Swahili, he was raised partly in Africa, where his parents were missionary teachers . Clinton said the real question now is what kind of pressure can be brought to bear on al-Bashir and the government in Khartoum to make them understand ""that they will be held responsible for every single death that occurs in those camps."" State Department spokesman Robert Wood told reporters, ""It's just a catastrophe that Bashir has created. We're going to continue to make this case and we're imploring others to make this case that he needs to reverse that decision he took. Thousands, hundreds of thousands of people, could possibly be at risk and it's irresponsible, the action he took, and he needs to reverse it and reverse it immediately. People's lives are at risk."" Clinton said countries that support al-Bashir's expulsion order ""have the responsibility to persuade the government in Sudan to change its decision to let the aid workers back, or they must replace with money and personnel those who have been expelled so that innocent lives are not lost and further undermined."" Clinton said the United States is ""very concerned"" and is looking for more effective ways to convince the Sudanese government that ""they have assumed an even greater sense of responsibility and infamy in the eyes of the world by turning their backs on these refugees whom they created in the first place."" Wood said it is clear that Bashir is the sole person at fault. ""Bashir is to blame for this crisis on the ground,"" he said.  His actions have only made things a lot worse. We are trying to get him to reverse this decision. We want to call on all those who have influence with the government of Sudan, institutions like the African Union, the Arab League, to do what they can to get Bashir to reverse his decision."" Obama, during his election campaign, made the crisis in Darfur a major focus. Since then, some have criticized him for putting it on the back burner. Seeking to rebut that view, Wood listed all recent steps the administration has taken to resolve the situation. Last week, he said, Obama discussed the deteriorating situation in Sudan with U.N. Secretary General Ban ki-Moon. U.S. officials have been meeting in New York, Washington and Khartoum with delegations from what Wood called ""like-minded nations."" Last weekend, the U.S. charge d'affaires in Sudan met with UNAMID (the African Union/United Nations operation in Darfur) and visited a camp for internally displaced people. And last week in New York, U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice spoke with the president of South Sudan and the Sudanese ambassador to the U.N. Wood said the U.S. has been reaching out to the Arab League, the African Union and other countries with influence on Sudan, trying to convince them the decision to expel some aid groups ""not only costs lives but serves to further isolate the country."" Asked whether the U.S. supports a move to defer the ICC indictment of Bashir, Wood said it does not support ""any deferral.""","State Department says Sudan president throwing out aid agencies is ""catastrophe""

"LONDON, England -- Painfully hot, they make your eyes water, your heart race and can turn your face embarrassingly red. Chilies have been used for many millenia both for their medicinal benefits and exciting falvor. Once only a staple of cuisine from far flung regions of the world, chilies can now be found in almost any dish around the globe. Last week an Indian woman wolfed down 51 ""ghost chilies,"" -- the world's spiciest -- in two minutes and smeared the seeds on her eyes for an entry into the Guinness World Records. Anandita Dutta Tamuly, 28, achieved the bizarre and fiery undertaking in the Indian north-eastern state of Assam. She was cheered on by British chef Gordon Ramsay, who also attempted a bite of the hot stuff before begging for water. A single seed can cause watering eyes, as well as a burning sensation in the mouth that can last up to five hours. A chili's spiciness is measured in Scoville units; the number of times a chili extract must be diluted in water in order for it to lose its heat. The ""ghost chili"", also known as bhut jolokia, has more than 1 million Scoville units, while Tabasco sauce ranges from 2,500 to 5,000 Scoville units and jalapeno peppers from 2,500 to 8,000 units. Chilies have formed part of the diet in the Americas since approximately 7,500 BC and owe most of their fame to their sometimes unbearably spicy flavor. But they have also long been recognized for their health benefits. Scientific research --and legend--  have attributed health wonders to chilies over the years. Diego Alvarez Chanca, a physician on explorer Christopher Columbus' second voyage to the West Indies in 1493, first wrote about the pepper's medicinal effects back in 1494. Below we look at effects eating chilies has on the body. Skin . Other than for its flavor-enhancing qualities, chili is, oddly enough, used to fight the summer heat. As the chili causes extreme sweating and blood rushing to the face, it cools the body down when the sweat evaporates, making it useful for combating heat. These same heat inducing properties are said to have a cumulative effect and over time are believed to alleviate pain when used in treatments for anything from arthritis and psoriasis to shingles and severe burns. Brain . The substances that give chili peppers their intensity when eaten or applied on the skin are called capsaicinoids. When consumed, capsaicinoids connect with pain receptors in the mouth and throat that are normally responsible for sensing heat. Once activated by the capsaicinoids, these receptors send a message to the brain that the person has consumed something hot. The brain responds to the burning sensation by raising the heart rate, increasing perspiration and releasing endorphins, called the body's ""natural painkillers"" and ""happy hormones."" Stomach . Chilies have long been associated with soothing the digestive system, by acting as stomach cleansers. According to the UK Food Guide, chili helps to settle stomach upset and encourages the production of good digestive acid. Chili aficionados believe the fruits can also induce weight loss because the substance that makes them ""hot"" speed up the body's metabolism. However, one study by the American Institute of Cancer Research performed in Mexico showed in 2003 that a high consumption of chilies (approximately nine to 25 jalapeno peppers per day) is in fact associated with stomach cancer. Immune system . Red chilies contain high amounts of carotene and vitamin C. It is said that chilies contain more vitamin C than citrus fruits. Chili peppers are also a good source of vitamin B6 and are very high in potassium, magnesium and iron, giving them a reputation for naturally boosting the body's immune system. Heart and other cardiovascular effects . A 2006 study published in the British Journal of Nutrition showed that after adding chili to the diet, bad cholesterol, that can often lead to heart problems, took a longer time to develop into heart diseases.","An Indian woman last week wolfed down 51 ""ghost chilies"" in two minutes .

"(CNN) -- Every dog has his day, but Sir Lancelot -- or at least his carbon copy -- has a second one. Edgar and Nina Otto show off 10-week-old Lancey, a clone of ""the most human of any dog we've ever had."" A Boca Raton, Florida, couple paid a California firm $155,000 to clone their beloved Labrador retriever, who died from cancer a year ago. The clone, a 10-week-old puppy dubbed Lancey, was hand-delivered to them earlier this week by Lou Hawthorne, chairman of BioArts International, a biotechnology company. ""One minute with Lancey and you know he's special. He's both extremely aware and very sweet,"" Hawthorne said in a BioArts statement. Edgar and Nina Otto said they began thinking about cloning Sir Lancelot about five years ago. ""I said 'Well, you know, it wouldn't hurt to have his DNA frozen,' and that's what we did,"" Nina Otto told CNN affiliate WPBF. The Ottos were one of five families to bid and win a BioArts auction for a chance to clone their family dog, according to a BioArts statement. Lancey is the world's first commercially cloned dog, the company said; the Ottos are the first of six current clients to receive their clone. Sir Lancelot's DNA sample was sent to the Sooam Biotech Research Foundation in Seoul, South Korea, which provides cloning services to BioArts. Researchers there put the DNA into an egg, and Lancey was born November 18, according to BioArts. The Ottos said they have had many beloved dogs over the years -- and have nine others currently -- but maintain Sir Lancelot was special. ""Sir Lancelot was the most human of any dog we've ever had,"" Edgar Otto said in the BioArts statement. ""He was a prince among dogs."" In an interview with WPBF, Edgar Otto said Sir Lancelot ""was a very, very, very special dog to us. And we've given a lot more to the Humane Society than we've ever spent on this project.""  Watch the Ottos talk about Lancelot and Lancey » . For its part, the Humane Society of the United States says it's against the commercial cloning of animals. ""Given the current pet overpopulation problem, which costs millions of animals their lives and millions in public tax dollars each year, the cloning of pets has no social value and in fact may lead to increased animal suffering,"" the organization said on its Web site. ""For those looking to replace a lost pet, cloning will not create an animal identical to the one who is gone; cloning cannot replicate an animal's uniqueness. Cloning can only replicate the pet's genetics, which influence but do not determine his physical attributes or personality."" The Ottos, however, said replicating Sir Lancelot's genetics is enough for them. Edgar Otto said he realizes Lancey might not be just like their departed dog, but ""if he's different, we're not going to love him any less."" Edgar Otto is the son of the late Edwin Otto, who was part of the founding of NASCAR and a ""motorsports pioneer,"" according to www.ottomotorsports.com.","Couple won auction to clone family dog, biotech company says .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo's sixth-minute strike saw holders Manchester United become the first English team to win in Porto, reaching the semifinals of the Champions League 3-2 on aggregate in the process. Ronaldo scores in spectacular style as Manchester United reached the Champions League semis. The European Player of the Year fired a spectacular 35-yard strike into the top corner as United remained on course to become the first team to retain the Champions League -- and will now face Premier League rivals Arsenal for a place in the final in Rome. The stunning goal was Ronaldo's 20th of the season but only his second in the Champions League since scoring the opener in last year's final in Moscow. After drawing the first leg 2-2 at Old Trafford, Porto only needed a low-scoring draw to reach the last four, but in truth they never looked threatening against a United defense superbly marshalled by Nemanja Vidic and the returning Rio Ferdinand. In fact, had Vidic been able to keep his close-range effort under the crossbar after John O'Shea had got the faintest of touches to a Ryan Giggs corner just before the interval, United would surely have completed their task in the first 45 minutes. ""We were very solid at the back tonight and that stability helped us,"" United manager Sir Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports. ""The return of Rio Ferdinand alongside Vidic was a major boost and scoring an early goal helped settle us.

"(CNN) -- The Mojave boneyard in the California desert is where old airplanes go to die -- a wasteland of decrepit planes, titanic heaps of titanium and aluminum waiting to be scrapped for metal in India or China. Plane boneyards are a rich source of spare parts for MotoArt to create their functional furniture. But for Dave Hall and Donovan Fell, the boneyard is only the beginning. They own MotoArt, a company based in California that turns old aircraft parts into high-end furniture and functional art. From beds and desks to light fixtures and wall partitions, Hall and Fell say they are doing more than reinventing cast-offs from retired planes, they're creating pieces of aviation history. ""Once they are gone we can never get them back again,"" said Hall of the abandoned planes at Mojave. ""So what we like to do is actually take these aircraft parts and preserve them and give them a second life in some really fun, functional art."" MotoArt began in 2000 when Hall and Fell, former co-workers at an architectural sign company in Los Angeles, collaborated on an art exhibition that showcased Fell's polished B-17 bomber propeller sculptures.  See before and after photos of recycled plane parts » . ""We sold out the entire show, and the gearheads all loved it,"" said Fell. It was then that the duo realized their unique art project could have a much wider audience. Encouraged by the success of the exhibit, the duo began exploring the nearby Mojave boneyard for more than just propellers -- B-25 rudders for desks, 747 jet engine cowlings for beds, F-4 ejection seats for, well, ejection seats. ""Who's never wanted an ejection chair?"" laughs Fell, sitting in the company's studio in Los Angeles, where the MotoArt team bring back the treasures they find in the Mojave Desert.  Watch Dave Hall at work at the Mojave boneyard » . The duo's most popular pieces of 'functional art' are their desks, ranging from the sleek 8-foot DC-9 tail stabilizer desk, which retail at around $15,000, to the imposing 14-foot DC-4 conference table, which costs a whopping $60,000. According to Hall, hundreds of hours are sometimes spent cutting, sanding, polishing and surfacing a single piece. It took the MotoArt team 220 hours to turn a single 747 cowling, the large shiny aluminum strip covering a jumbo jet engine, into a spectacular 8.5-foot diameter chrome receptionist's desk. Hall said it takes hundreds of hours to produce a fuselage partition, from using a chainsaw to slice 10-foot sheets out of the main section of a plane, to polishing and readying it for the showroom floor of the Dutch carmaker Spyker, which has commissioned MotoArt to create exhibitions for the company around the world. Hall and Fell began the company out of their garage, and now have 15 employees and a 12,000 square-foot studio with a showroom that could double as an aviation museum. ""It's like a larger version of my room when I was 10 years old,"" says Fell of the MotoArt headquarters. But MotoArt is anything but child's play -- in just nine years the company has carved out a niche in the high-end furniture market, creating a multi-million dollar business thanks to a wide range of corporate clients. The company counts Boeing, Microsoft, Red Bull and the United States government as happy MotoArt customers, as well as a number of airplane enthusiasts and celebrities. But for Hall and Fell, it is the preservation of the planes that gives them the greatest satisfaction. ""It's heartbreaking to see these planes that have serviced our country for decades being crunched up and destroyed, and it gives us a little piece of heart that we are able to recycle this and give it a second life,"" he said.","Men at MotoArt search boneyards for old plane parts to recycle into furniture .

"(CNN) -- Nearly two centuries ago Wednesday, Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry signed an obscure redistricting law that helped his party stay in office and, more importantly, codified one of the most enduring legacies in U.S. politics: gerrymandering. The U.S. House of Represenatives, home to many beneficiaries of gerrymandering. Now a part of an American lexicon often heard in Washington's K Street bars and among ""inside-the-beltway"" crowds, the term is seen as a combination of the governor's name and the word ""salamander,"" because of the salamander-like shape one electoral district took on after the redistricting. Elected governor in 1810, Gerry signed the redistricting bill two years later, enabling greater and perhaps disproportionate Republican representation in the Massachusetts legislature. The controversial move has become a favorite across the country among incumbent parties, which pack opposition voters into districts already lost in an effort to minimize the opposition's influence over the state's broader electorate. But some political analysts cry foul. ""In the end, democracy comes out the big loser,"" former federal prosecutor Edward Lazarus wrote in a 2004 column for CNN. ""The effect of such partisan gerrymandering is to block new entrants into high political office and to make the result of almost every congressional election a foregone conclusion. This, in turn, effectively disenfranchises all those voters who don't support the preordained winner,"" he wrote. In 2006, the Supreme Court threw out part of a Texas congressional map, but found the overall redistricting plan orchestrated by House Republicans acceptable. The redistricting helped Republicans in Texas defeat four Democratic congressmen in the 2004 elections. The court ruled that the redistricting plan, promoted by then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, unfairly weakened the voting strength of Latinos in two congressional districts. ""A state may not trade off the rights of some members of a racial group against the rights of other members of that group,"" wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy. ""The question is therefore not whether line-drawing in the challenged area as a whole dilutes minority voting strength, but whether line-drawing dilutes the voting strength of the Latinos in [Texas'] District 23."" The court ordered that District 23 be redrawn. States are constitutionally required to redraw congressional districts every 10 years in line with population shifts documented by the U.S. Census Bureau, a part of the Department of Commerce. This year, controversy re-emerged when President Barack Obama announced a decision to cross party lines and nominate U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-New Hampshire, to run the Commerce Department. The move sparked criticism from leaders of minority groups concerned that the Census Bureau under Gregg, who voted to abolish the Commerce Department in 1995, might lack the resources needed to accurately count minorities. The White House promised to work directly with bureau's director to assuage those concerns, but that response drew further criticism from House Republicans concerned about greater executive influence in the Census Bureau. In a letter to the president, House Republicans Patrick McHenry and Darrell Issa described the White House as ""circumventing the secretary of commerce"" and called it ""both outrageous and unprecedented,"" suggesting the Obama administration could affect U.S. census results and congressional districting due out in 2010. The move, they say, could insulate Democratic congressional power. The White House said it recognizes the importance of an accurate census count ""free from politicization"" and added it ""has not proposed removing the census from the Department of Commerce."" ""From the first days of the transition, the census has been a priority for the president, and a process he wanted to re-evaluate,"" it said in an earlier statement. The method through which the Census Bureau collects data has long been a topic of partisan bickering. Republicans have generally favored the ""door-to-door"" approach, which actually is done primarily by self-enumeration through the U.S. mail. Democrats commonly prefer a statistical sampling method meant to fill in ""population gaps"" they say occur because some members of minority groups and homeless populations are missed by the door-to-door approach. A 1999 Supreme Court ruling said statistical sampling could not be applied to the redistribution of congressional seats, but it did not put gerrymandering of the political landscape entirely off limits. So, almost 200 years after Elbridge Gerry helped coin the term, gerrymandering remains a key part of American politics. CNN's Bill Mears and Keating Holland contributed to this report.","Term coined after Massachusetts Gov. Gerry signed redistricting law in early 1800s .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Federal safety officials want the Federal Aviation Administration to immediately ground a type of small sports aircraft, saying six of the planes have broken up in flight in the past three years, killing 10 people. The National Transportation Safety Board questions the safety of the Zodiac CH-601XL. In an urgent letter to the FAA, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board says there is ""substantial circumstantial evidence"" that aerodynamic ""flutter"" preceded some, if not all, of the fatal accidents, and that more accidents are likely to occur if action isn't taken. Flutter is a condition in which airflow around the plane causes unsafe structural vibrations. The vibrations can quickly cause the plane to break up if it is not sufficiently dampened, the safety board said. The aircraft involved is the Zodiac CH-601XL, a single-engine, two-seater that was designed by Zenair Inc. It is built by various manufacturers and also sold as a kit. In making its recommendation, the safety board said it reviewed six fatal accidents, including crashes in Spain and the Netherlands, and said flutter is the likely cause of the accidents. The board said it also considered other incidents that did not result in deaths. The NTSB said two other countries, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have grounded the aircraft. The FAA had no immediate response to the safety board's recommendation. A Zenair official did not immediately return a reporter's phone call. But the NTSB letter says Zenair contends that the flutter problem can be addressed by proper cable tension, and asserted that a November 2005 certification flight test confirmed the plane is protected from flutter. But the safety board said the type of testing used may not be adequate to uncover all susceptibility to flutter. The NTSB said the FAA certified the CH-601XL as a Special Light Sport Aircraft in 2005. This type of certification does not require that the FAA approve the airplane's design. Instead, the airplane model is issued an airworthiness certificate if the manufacturer asserts that the plane meets industry-accepted design standards and has passed a series of ground and flight tests. The safety board is asking the FAA to prohibit further flight of the Zodiac CH-601XL until the board can determine that the airplane is no longer susceptible to aerodynamic flutter. ""The NTSB does not often recommend that all airplanes of a particular type be prohibited from further flight,"" NTSB Acting Chairman Mark V. Rosenker said in writing comments. ""In this case, we believe such action will save lives. ""Unless the safety issues with this particular Zodiac model are addressed, we are likely to see more accidents in which pilots and passengers are killed in airplanes that they believed were safe to fly."" The safety board also found that the stick-force gradient -- a measure of the force applied to the control stick and the increase in lift that results -- was not uniform throughout the range of motion, particularly at high vertical accelerations or increased gravitational forces. The lessening of the gradient at high gravitational force could make the airplane susceptible to being inadvertently over-controlled by the pilot, which could create a condition in which the airplane is stressed beyond its design limits, leading to an in-flight structural failure. CNN's Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report.","National Transportation Safety Board questions safety of the Zodiac CH-601XL .

"(CNN)  -- Over 28,000 Liverpool fans marked the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in a special memorial service at Anfield on Wednesday. Liverpool supporters at the Kop end paid their respects in an emotional afternoon at Anfield. A total of 96 supporters died on April 15, 1989 before the FA Cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium, the worst-ever tragedy in English sporting history. To commemorate the anniversary, the city of Liverpool came to a standstill at 3.06 pm (1406 GMT) with the bells of the two cathedrals and its civic buildings ringing out in memory of those fans who lost their lives. On Anfield's famous Kop, 96 candles were lit while commemorations took place at Hillsborough and also in Nottingham.  Watch fans mark Hillsborough » . Members of the current Liverpool team stood somberly as hymns were played before a roll call of the dead was read out. Club legend Kenny Dalglish, who was Liverpool manager at the time of the disaster, then read a short prayer. The mayor of Liverpool, Steve Rotherham, who was at the game 20 years ago, helped organize the emotional memorial. ""Hillsborough affected so many lives, not just on Merseyside but across the whole of the UK,"" he said. ""I attended the match 20 years ago and the passing years do not diminish the importance and the poignancy of this occasion."" Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, whose 10-year-old cousin Jon-Paul Gilhooley was the youngest victim of the tragedy, spoke of his feelings this week. ""Time has gone by, but the scars will never ever be healed and the fans will never ever forget. So you can always rely on our supporters to be there for you when you need them."" The Liverpool fans died in a crush which started just before the kick-off as the gate at the Leppings Lane End was opened with terrible consequences. The match started but when the scale of the tragedy became clear, it was swiftly abandoned at 3.06 pm. In the immediate aftermath, the British government commissioned Lord Justice Taylor to conduct an inquiry which would have a far-reaching impact on football. Taylor was deeply critical of the police operation at Hillsborough, but his most significant recommendations were the removal of perimeter fencing and the creation of all-seater stadia. His report also cleared Liverpool fans of blame for the tragedy after lurid tabloid headlines provoked revulsion on Merseyside. Prime minister Gordon Brown paid reference to the controversy in an interview released on Liverpool's official television channel. ""It was wrong for people to blame, as some did, Liverpool fans on that day,"" he said. ""That's probably what matters most -- that people understood that the behavior of Liverpool fans in helping each other was magnificent. ""Let's never forget the fans who cruelly lost their lives on a day when we know the people of Liverpool were trying to help each other,"" he added. However, the people of Liverpool are still angry and bitter at the lack of justice for those who died -- and that frustration surfaced when Andy Burnham, the   Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport took to the stand to address the crowd. As Burnham spoke, the crowd rose as one to sing ""Justice for the 96"". The Kop chant boomed around the stadium and Burnham, an Everton fan, was left in no doubt about the strength of feeling over the lack of accountability from officialdom over the tragedy. Fittingly, the ceremony was concluded with Gerry Marsden leading the fans in singing Liverpool anthem 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.","A special memorial has marked the 20th anniversary of Hillsborough tragedy .

"(CNN)  -- The French navy on Wednesday captured 11 suspected pirates off the coast of Kenya, Franc'e mnistry of defense announced, while other pirates who had held a Greek vessel for nearly a month let it go. Pirates attacked The Liberty Sun, a U.S.-flagged  cargo ship, but were unable to board. The navy tracked the pirates overnight after they attacked a ship called the Safmarine Asia, then seized them at dawn Wednesday morning, the ministry said in a statement. The Greek-flagged Titan cargo ship was carrying a load of iron to South Korea when pirates seized it. Twenty-four crew members were on board -- 17 Filipinos, three Greeks, three Romanians and a Ukrainian. They are in good health, said Tilemahos Gasteratos, spokesman for the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry. The European Union, NATO and the United States have been patrolling the region since an upsurge in piracy off the coast of Somalia began last year. U.S. snipers on Sunday killed three pirates holding hostage a U.S. merchant ship captain. Richard Phillips was held in a lifeboat for five days after his ship, the Maersk Alabama, was attacked last week. The freed Maersk crew members are expected to return to the United States on Wednesday evening. Pirates in Somalia vowed revenge. Pirates said an attack Tuesday on another U.S.-flagged merchant ship, the Liberty Sun, was in response to the killing of Phillips' captors. ""It was a revenge,"" Hassan Mohamud told a Somali journalist. ""The U.S. ship escaped by a matter of chance."" ""We sent out 14 boats full of well-armed men and we are looking for vessels of U.S. and French nationals,"" said Mohamud. He is a pirate leader based Gara'ad in Puntland, a semi-autonomous Somali region with a long coastline along the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden. ""The U.S. and French governments should know this because they started the aggression on us,"" he said. Other pirates in the region have also vowed revenge. Two days before Phillips was rescued, the French military freed four hostages, including a child, who had been held by pirates for nearly a week on a yacht off Somalia's coast. In that operation, a hostage and two pirates were killed, the French Defense Ministry said. Three pirates were captured. Separately, a court in Puntland sentenced 27 Somali pirates to prison after the judge said they had been caught red-handed. Shiekh Mohamed Abdi Aware, the presiding judge, read the verdict to the media. He said that each of the pirates would face three years in prison. A crew member aboard the Liberty Sun managed to e-mail his mother while the ship was under fire. ""We are under attack by pirates, we are being hit by rockets. Also bullets."" Katy Urbik said her heart stopped as she read that in an e-mail from her son Thomas. ""We are barricaded in the engine room and so far no one is hurt. [A] rocket penetrated the bulkhead but the hole is small. Small fire too but put out,"" the message from her son continued. ""Navy is on the way and helos and ships are coming. I'll try to send you another message soon. [G]ot to go now. I love you mom and dad and all my brothers and family."" amFIX: Full interview with Katy Urbik . Ubrik, of Wheaton, Illinois, said her son e-mailed again half an hour later. ""The Navy has showed up in full force and we are now under military escort ... all is well. I love you all and thank you for the prayers,"" his message said. The ordeal followed a tense week for the family, said Ubrik, who had closely followed news of the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama and the kidnapping of its captain. She said of receiving her son's shocking e-mail: . ""My heart stopped as soon as I realized there wasn't going to be a 'just kidding' after his comment. Because I had heard from his earlier [Tuesday] morning, saying they had a plan with the Navy, they were being monitored, they had been practicing drills to get into the engine room."" ""I opened up my e-mail and it was one of those surreal moments where, am I really reading this?"" After the thwarted attack on the Liberty Sun, the vessel was being escorted by the guided missile destroyer USS Bainbridge -- the same ship carrying Phillips after his dramatic rescue Sunday.  Watch the tough tactics the Navy uses » . About 20 U.S. citizens are aboard the Liberty Sun. The ship was delivering humanitarian supplies from the U.N. World Food Programme, CARE and other groups, two senior defense officials told CNN. Pirates off the coast of Somalia seized two other freighters Tuesday. First, they hijacked the MV Irene EM, a 35,000-ton Greek-owned bulk carrier, according to a NATO spokesman and the European Union's Maritime Security Center. The crew of the Greek ship was thought to be unhurt, and ships have been warned to stay clear of the area for fear of further attack, the security center said. Later Tuesday, pirates on four skiffs seized the 5,000-ton MV Sea Horse, a Lebanese-owned and Togo-flagged vessel, Cmdr. Chris Davies said from NATO's Maritime Component Command Headquarters in Northwood, England. Further details about the ship and its crew weren't immediately available. The two freighters seized Tuesday are the third and fourth vessels to be hijacked in two days off the Somali coast. Pirates on Monday hijacked two Egyptian fishing boats carrying a total of between 18 and 24 people, the Egyptian Information Ministry told CNN. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry is working to end the hijacking, the information ministry said. Piracy accelerated after the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms. Those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions. Some experts say companies are making the problem worse by paying the pirates. About 16,000 ships a year pass through the region, according to the French Foreign Ministry. CNN's Pierre Meilhan, Christine Theodorou, Niki Cook, Mike Mount and Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","NEW: Pirates had held Greek ship and its load of iron for nearly a month .

"(CNN) -- Missouri Rep. Roy Blunt Thursday announced his intention to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate, a move that sets up what is likely to be a showdown between two prominent families in one of the country's most politically divided states. Former House Republican Whip Roy Blunt announced he will run for a Missouri Senate seat. Making the official announcement in St. Louis, Missouri, the former House Republican whip indicated he would run on a platform of keeping Democratic control of both Congress and the White House in check. ""Common sense and open debate are in danger of being suppressed by the overreaching liberal monopoly in Congress and the White House,"" he said, according to prepared remarks. ""Never has Washington been in greater need of hearing from people who work hard, pay their taxes and want solutions to urgent economic problems and the ongoing threat of terrorism."" ""My sense is Missourians and Americans are not well served by one-party rule,"" Blunt also said, citing the massive stimulus measure signed by President Obama that won little Republican support. Blunt's announcement comes two weeks after Democrat Robin Carnahan jumped into the race. Carnahan is another Missourian with prominent name recognition who enjoys widespread support. ""The Missouri Senate race is shaping up to be one of the most competitive races of the cycle,"" said Nathan Gonzalez, political editor of the Rothenberg Report. ""It has attracted two of the biggest names of the state that has a history of closest elections."" Both Blunt and Carnahan are seeking the Senate seat set to be vacated by longtime Missouri Republican Kit Bond. Blunt, a six-term congressman representing the state's conservative southwestern corner, is a longtime Missouri politician with high name recognition across the state and solid support among his party's conservative base. He has run for statewide office several times during his nascent political career, having served as secretary of state for two terms before losing the Republican primary for governor in 1992. His son Matt also served as the state's governor from 2005-2009, but ultimately decided not to seek another term because of low approval ratings. Blunt faces a state that has become increasing Democratic in the last several election cycles. The state's other Senate seat went Democratic in 2006 with Claire McCaskill's narrow win, and Democrat Jay Nixon was elected governor of the state in 2008. But Republicans still hold edges in the state's House and Senate chambers and have a majority of the state's nine congressional seats. While Blunt is likely to enjoy the support of the party's establishment, he could face a competitive primary challenge from former state Treasurer Sarah Steelman, a vocal critic of her party's leadership who narrowly lost a bruising primary bid for governor last year. Even though she is not particularly popular in her party, Steelman's message of reform could resonate if the GOP's national approval ratings remain low throughout the next two years. ""Republicans would like to avoid a primary in the Senate race, but she's not the kind of person they will be able to just shove out of a race,"" Gonzalez said. ""She relishes in being in an outsider role."" But should Blunt make it to a general election facing Carnahan, the race will likely become a hard-fought and high-profile battle of two powerful political names. Carnahan's father, Mel, served as governor of the state from 1993-2000 and died in a plane crash while running for the U.S. Senate. Carnahan still won the seat, defeating then-Republican Sen. John Ashcroft, and Carnahan's wife Jean held the post for two years. Carnahan's brother is also a U.S. congressman representing the outskirts of St. Louis. But national Democrats are eager for a match-up against Blunt, who was a protégé to former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and has been linked to disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. ""As one of the faces of the same old Republican Party, Roy Blunt enters this race with a whole lot of baggage and a whole lot of questions to answer,"" said Eric Schultz, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's communication's director. Democrats will also highlight Blunt's stalwart support of former President Bush, especially when it comes to economic policies. ""I'd hate to be him, and explaining my votes on the Bush positions,"" DSCC chairman Bob Menendez said of Blunt last week. ""They got their ideas into law. It created one of the worst economies I have ever seen.""","Ex-Republican whip wants to keep Democratic control in check .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Lillo Brancato Jr., an actor who appeared in ""The Sopranos,"" was acquitted of the 2005 killing an off-duty New York City police officer but found guilty of attempted burglary. Lillo Brancato Jr. appeared on ""The Sopranos"" and played alongside Robert De Niro in ""A Bronx Tale."" Brancato, 32, was also acquitted of two counts of burglary, but could face three to 15 years in prison on the attempted burglary charge. He has already served three years, according to his attorney, Joseph Tacopina. Police officer Daniel Enchautegui, 28, was killed trying to break up a burglary attempt at his neighbor's house in the Bronx in December 2005. During the trial, Brancato said there was not a break-in. Brancato said he knew the owner of the home, and that he and friend Steven Armento, 51, were drinking at a strip club when they decided to go hunt for valium. Brancato told the jury that the owner, a Vietnam veteran, gave him permission to come to his house and take painkillers or other pills whenever he wanted. Brancato admitted to breaking a window at the home, but said it was strictly because he was going through intense heroin withdrawal that night and he said he was trying to wake up his friend to get the drugs. When Brancato and Armento entered the home, the next door neighbor -- Enchautegui -- came outside to investigate. That's when prosecutors said Armento shot the officer through the heart with his .357 Magnum. Armento was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in November. The jury in that trial took less than six hours to convict Armento. Enchautegui was shot in the chest by Armento when he interrupted the alleged robbery, but managed to shoot both suspects multiple times before dying. ""This jury spoke loud and clear, that Lillo had nothing to do with the murder of this police officer,"" Tacopina said. Brancato appeared on six episodes of the hit HBO series ""The Sopranos"" as a wannabe mobster in 2000.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Chen Xiao had pretty much given up making her own decisions and so decided to throw open her life to the whims of China's hundreds of millions of Internet users, known in China as netizens. Beijing resident Chen Xiao decided to put her life up for sale after an unhappy 2008. ""It's your right to arrange Chen Xiao's life, and it's my obligation to serve you,"" read her online shop. Since December, Chen has been allowing others to decide what she will do each day, because, for the most part, last year was awful, she said. Her hometown was hit by blizzards, her country rocked by a devastating earthquake, friends divorced and her clothing shop went bankrupt. ""Every time I had a plan for what I wanted my life to be like, nothing would come of it. It was very disappointing. I figured if other people came up with things for me to do, I might stumble upon something new and better,"" she told CNN. What she stumbled upon was not only a new life but a new way to make a living. She charges about $3 an hour, and she's been asked to do almost everything from delivering pet food to caring for stray cats to taking a hot lunch to a homeless man. What surprised her the most was not so much the varied requests but being able to find happiness in the process. ""If somebody asks you to do something, something simple, and you do it, it can make you very happy. You can change from a gloomy person to a very bright one. It can help give you a new sense of self-esteem,"" she said. So far, the most meaningful assignment she was given was attending a child's birth -- the father was a complete stranger who just wanted someone to take pictures and share the moment. There are limits to what she will agree to do. She will not do anything illegal, immoral or violent, but she said that has not stopped some from asking. ""When I first started there was this man who would send me these really disgusting text messages. His words were over the top... nauseating,"" she said. There was also a man who wanted to meet her for a few private hours at a ski chalet. When she turned up with a friend to take photographs, he backed out and then demanded a refund, but Chen refused. In many ways she is just a glorified errand girl, but with a unique China twist. Chen is another example here of how in China the Internet is crossing over from cyberspace to the real world. Chen does not know how much longer she will keep taking cyberrequests. For now it is a good way to survive the financial crisis when many others are losing their jobs and businesses are going broke. ""When people stop needing me, I'll go back to my original life. But I don't know what will come,"" she said. China's netizens will most likely make that decision for her as well.","26-year-old Chen Xiao put her life online, asking people to fill it with tasks .

""Every couple months, it [layoffs] went through the company and a few people here and there and it got worse and worse,"" he said. ""I knew it was in the future somewhere."" Now, he is looking for a job and keeping his fingers crossed his condition doesn't worsen. Ehlers-Danlos is a group of inherited disorders that affect connective tissues. In Pegram's case, it means constant pain in his legs and some other joints. ""One type is you can have heart failure if you don't get checked out, so it's pretty serious that you actually go to the doctor,"" Pegram said. His monthly visit costs $150 -- and patients like Pegram who are without insurance are asked to pay up front. His medications run about $126 at a discount pharmacy. Pegram has old bills showing that when he was at Hanes and insured, the same medication cost the insurance company $68 because of its discount. His doctor also accepted a lower negotiated rate from the insurer. ""So everything is inflated,"" he said of his medical costs now. He could have signed up for the COBRA health coverage available to workers as they lose their jobs. It was that policy Pegram said would have cost him $550 or ""almost half of what you get every month"" in jobless benefits and leave him ""not able to pay for a place to live, and food, and all that.""  Watch President Obama's summit on health care » . In an interview at his condo, we asked Pegram: ""Should you be doing more? If you had insurance, would you be doing more, seeing more doctors?"" ""Yes, I would be."" ""And what's the risk of not doing that?"" ""I could go downhill quicker. It's a debilitating condition, so eventually I could, I don't know."" Yet he is remarkably upbeat about his health and about the prospects of finding a job before his benefits run out in a few months. ""I think I will find something before then,"" Pegram said, while conceding he might be forced soon to lower his sights and look for work that pays less than his Hanes position as long as it provides health care coverage. The jobless rate in the Winston-Salem metropolitan area was 7.6 percent in December 2008, up from 4.4 percent one year earlier. With the higher unemployment comes increases in the number of residents without health insurance. Dr. Bruce Wham has been a practicing dentist for 26 years and an amateur economist for the past year or so. ""Most people feel like it is going to get worse before it gets better,"" Wham said when we visited his practice. ""Talking to patients, talking about automobile purchases, any kind of renovations of houses, even education -- sending their kids to college, there is a lot of concern about purchasing those things or how they are going to do those things and dentistry is sometimes considered more of a luxury than a necessity and we get pushed to the back lot."" One way Wham can tell if a longtime patient is about to lose his or her job is if they suddenly schedule treatments and repairs they had been putting off. It is a sign they are about to lose their insurance coverage. ""Especially if there is something that they need to get done or have been 'treatment-planned' for and they have been told by the dentist, the hygienist, to replace this, yes, they are more likely to want to come in and get that done as soon as they can,"" Wham said. The flip side: A patient who needs major work who instead endures the pain, or asks Wham if there is a cheaper, though perhaps temporary, solution. ""If there is anything that can be delayed or pushed back, that is what they are doing. They are asking us, 'Is there any way that we can hold off? Is there anything less involved, less costly until I get my job, until I know my insurance is going to be back?' in effect. ""And so we do a lot of that, not necessarily temporary restorations, but things that might not last as long and that may not be as costly to try to tide people over for the short term."" So it maybe is not in the best interest of the patient in the long term, but maybe better on their wallet in the short term? ""Better on their wallet. That is exactly right.""","As jobless rate rises, so does the number of people without health insurance .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of mourners filled a Tracy, California, high school gym Thursday to remember slain 8-year-old Sandra Renee Cantu. Sandra Cantu, 8, had been missing almost two weeks before her body was found. The little girl made national headlines after she went missing March 27 from a mobile home park in Tracy where she lived with her family. She was on her way to a friend's home and her playful skipping down an alley was caught by a surveillance camera. Police later found her body stuffed into a suitcase and submerged in a pond at a nearby dairy farm. Photos of Sandra, flowers and stuffed animals covered the front of the stage. Family members, friends and state dignitaries memorialized the child during a ceremony that lasted just over an hour. The printed program called the memorial service ""A Celebration of Life,"" and organizers said they hoped the service would help ease the pain the community has suffered since Sandra's disappearance. ""We are left with the haunting image of her skipping on the streets of Tracy. But today she is skipping on the streets of gold, into the arms of a loving God"", said Brent Ives, mayor of Tracy. Cindy Sasser, principal at Jacobsen Elementary School told mourners, ""We should all strive to be like Sandra -- always smiling, wanting to help, to look out for others and to be caring."" The service included a video that showcased some of the family's favorite photos. People from across California attended, filling the gymnasium, cafeteria and the football stadium at West High School. Melissa Huckaby, 28, a Sunday school teacher who lived in the same mobile home park as Sandra's family, has been charged with murder, kidnapping, the performance of a lewd and lascivious act on a child under 14, and rape by instrument. If convicted, she would face the death penalty or life in prison without parole, San Joaquin County District Attorney James Willett said this week. A private memorial service for Sandra was held Wednesday. Her casket, signed by classmates, was taken to a nearby burial site by a horse-drawn carriage.","NEW: Photo montage shown at service for Sandra at a high school in Tracy .

"(InStyle.com) -- So you're finally ready to settle down and make that marriage proposal? There's no better time to do it than engagement season, which, lucky for you, is now! Get inspired by these uber-romantic celebrity proposals. Brandon Routh popped the question to Courtney Ford while on a picnic. Tia Mowry and Cory Hardrict . Although the set of a slasher movie seems an unlikely place for romance to bloom, that's just where it happened for actors Tia Mowry and Cory Hardrict. Shortly after shooting began in 1999 on their film ""Hollywood Horror,"" the co-stars started spending time together. Seven years later, on Christmas Day 2006, Hardrict, 32, told Mowry, 30, that he wanted to give her a promise ring. Then, as her entire family looked on, the ""Lincoln Heights"" actor yelled, ""Psych!"" and got down on one knee to present her with a 1.5-carat diamond engagement ring. Antonio Pierce and Jocelyn Maldonado . Antonio Pierce, an NFL linebacker, met Jocelyn Maldonado during a celebrity appearance at an ESPN Fantasy Football Draft. Maldonado, a model at the event, instantly caught his eye. Pierce and Maldonado (who now hosts Mets Weekly) were inseparable over the next six months. In February 2007, Pierce treated Maldonado to a helicopter ride above Manhattan, New York, before dining at Brooklyn's The River Café. Famous for its chocolate Brooklyn Bridge cake, Pierce conspired with the restaurant's manager to place the engagement ring atop the confection, which was covered with pink rose petals. Howie Dorough and Leigh Boniello . Backstreet Boy Howard ""Howie"" Dorough got more than he bargained for after hiring Leigh Boniello to be the band's webmaster in December 2000. Boniello went on tour with the group and quickly grew close to Dorough. Six years later, the couple attended a New Year's Eve party at the New Jersey home of Boniello's father. ""I figured, what better timing,"" says Dorough, ""because all of her family was going to be there, including her 92-year-old grandmother."" Just before the stroke of midnight, Dorough made a toast and presented Boniello with a custom-designed three-stone diamond engagement ring. Brandon Routh and Courtney Ford . Three years before actor Brandon Routh donned those famous blue tights, he tended bar at Lucky Strike Lanes in Hollywood. During a party there in 2003, actress Courtney Ford repeatedly poured out the drinks he made her as a ruse to chat him up. ""I kept asking him for another drink, telling him the one before was too strong,"" she recalls. In 2006, Routh purchased the 3-carat diamond ring that had caught Ford's eye during an earlier visit to Neil Lane. But since the two were traveling for the Superman Returns press tour, Routh asked Gilbert Adler, one of the film's producers, to hold the ring until they arrived in England. ""Poor man!"" says Routh. ""He carried it around for two and a half weeks."" Finally, while picnicking in Glastonbury, Routh popped the question. Roselyn Sanchez and Eric Winter . Roselyn Sanchez and Eric Winter became friends after meeting at a party in 2006 and Sanchez immediately pegged him as perfect husband material. She found out for certain that he felt the same way just two days before Christmas 2007, under a full moon at midnight, in a bay off the coast of the Puerto Rican island Vieques. The two were seated in a double kayak, taking in the bioluminescent organisms shimmering in the water all alone, except for a tour guide in a second kayak. The scene should have been pure bliss, except that Sachez was concerned when their guide speedily paddled away. ""The guy knew to take off so Eric could propose, but imagine how I felt floating in this huge bay in the middle of the night with nobody around,"" Sanchez explains. ""I started calling back, 'Senor, hello! Come back!' until I realized something was going on."" After an ""amazing speech,"" Winter pulled out a 4.3-carat brilliant-cut diamond ring by Michael Barin, Sanchez's favorite jeweler. But her joy was soon laced with anxiety over the fact that such a costly bauble was surrounded by acres of sea. ""I said, 'Put it away, please. I don't want it to drop in the water!'"" Anna Chlumsky and Shaun So . Actress Anna Chlumsky, 27, best known for her role in ""My Girl,"" was awaiting her seven-year anniversary with college sweetheart and army reservist Shaun So, 28, and hoping he might pop the question. While they were having breakfast at a café in her neighborhood a week before their anniversary, Chlumsky described a cocktail ring a friend was selling. So, who had been carrying an engagement ring for two weeks in anticipation of the perfect moment, pulled out the 1-carat, cathedral-mounted, radiant-cut bauble and asked, ""Does it look anything like this?"" Guiliana DePandi & Bill Rancic . It started out all business: Giuliana DePandi was interviewing Bill Rancic, first-season winner on ""The Apprentice"" and co-host of the Chicago, Illinois, TV show ""In the Loop with iVillage."" But when the cameras stopped rolling in April 2006, a whirlwind -- and adventurous -- romance began. Eight months later, when Rancic, 36, popped the question during a chopper flight over Chicago, complete with champagne, Giordano's deep-dish pizza (DePandi's favorite) and Michael Bublé tunes piped into the headset. ""Bill told me we were going to look at Christmas lights,"" says DePandi. ""It was dark in the helicopter, so I didn't really get a look at the ring until the next day, when I went into shock for the second time,"" she says of the 4-carat cushion-cut diamond in a micro pavé setting Rancic helped design. Jeri Ryan and Chistophe Eme . ""He was hot!"" Shark star Jeri Ryan, 39, recalls of first glimpsing her future husband, Christophe Emé, 38, at a food-related charity event four years ago. ""He looked good in his chef's hat, and he had this ornery little spark in his eye that I really enjoy."" After dating for two years, the couple opened Ortolan, their celebrated French restaurant in Los Angeles, California. The proposal came soon after. ""One night, Christophe covered my eyes and took me into our bedroom,"" recalls Ryan. There the die-hard romantic had placed candles, champagne and a canvas painted with the messages ""And you come with me forever"" in French and ""Grow old along with me"" in English. Emé then presented Ryan with a made-to-order cushion-cut solitaire set in pavé diamonds. Jason Priestley and Naomi Lowde . Fate has looked after Jason Priestley. On Valentine's Day 2000 the actor met Naomi Lowde, a makeup artist from Hertfordshire, England, while walking back from a play rehearsal in London. ""I was smitten,"" says Priestley, now 36. The Beverly Hills, 90210 alum and Lowde, 27, immediately began dating, and in 2002 they moved back to California together. That's when fate took another turn: On August 11, 2002, Priestley was driving his race car on a Kentucky track when he hit a wall at 180 mph. Though he sustained three skull fractures, a broken back and a bleeding artery in his neck, he pulled through. ""It was a tough time, but it was also magical because we kept each other's spirits high,"" says Lowde. ""We pushed two beds together in the hospital and put Swifty, our French bulldog, in the middle. We were together 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for three months."" In May 2004 Priestley arranged another trip to London, England -- to the very street corner where he and Naomi first met, where he presented her with an emerald-cut, three-diamond ring by Steven Pomerantz. Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O'Connell . What happens in Vegas doesn't always stay in Vegas -- and for Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O'Connell, that's not a bad thing. Nearly four years ago the two ran into each other poolside at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. ""I was working on a documentary, and Jerry offered to help,"" recalls Romijn, 35. ""He spent a week operating the microphone, but later he told me he would have done anything. I don't think he really cared about the project, if you know what I mean."" For their first date the couple went to see the Blue Man Group with friends, and O'Connell had Romijn in stitches. ""It was this whole Jerry show in my ear. That's how it is with Jerry. You get sucked into it!"" Evidently: A year and a half later, on September 18, 2005, O'Connell, 33, proposed to Romijn in New York with a diamond ring from Simon G. ""I got down on one knee, asked her to marry me and said, 'You better say yes' a couple of times -- there was a little bit of a pause on her part,"" says O'Connell. Romijn's take? ""Not true!""

"(CNN) -- Van Johnson, whose boyish looks and earnest manner made him a Hollywood heartthrob in the 1940s and '50s, died Friday in an assisted-care facility, a friend told CNN. Van Johnson and Judy Garland in ""In the Good Old Summertime,"" one of many musicals in his lengthy career. Johnson, 92, died around 11 a.m. of natural causes at the Tappan Zee Manor in Nyack, New York, where he had lived for seven years, said Wendy Bleiweiss. Johnson's career stretched over six decades and across genres, from comedies and war films, such as ""The Caine Mutiny"" and ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo,"" to Broadway musicals and television shows, including a guest spot as the Minstrel on the campy 1960s series, ""Batman,"" according to Turner Classic Movies' Web site. The red-haired, freckle-faced actor's youthful charm earned him a huge teen following in his heyday. He became known as the ""voiceless Sinatra,"" despite a singing voice that landed him roles alongside June Allyson and Judy Garland in ""Two Girls and a Sailor"" and ""In the Good Old Summertime,"" according to TCM.com. Johnson was born August 25, 1916, to a plumber and housewife in Newport, Rhode Island. He was 16 years old when he left Rhode Island for New York City so he could forge a career in acting, Bleiweiss said. A few years later, he got his break from Lucille Ball, she said. ""She saw this redhead kid and said, 'Let's give him a break. He seems like he can do some acting,' "" Bleiweiss said. Johnson made his Broadway debut in 1936 in ""New Faces of 1936"" before legendary director-playwright George Abbott hired him as a chorus member and understudy to the three male leads in Rodgers and Hart's ""Too Many Girls"" in 1939. The next year, Abbott cast him as a chorus boy and Gene Kelly's understudy in Rodgers and Hart's groundbreaking musical ""Pal Joey,"" according to TCM.com. His film debut followed in 1940 with a role in the chorus of ""Too Many Girls."" While en route to a screening in 1942, he was in a car wreck that left him with a metal plate in his head and kept him out of the military. But that didn't stop him from acting in war films. Two years later, he received top billing in ""Two Girls and a Sailor."" Other big roles included ""A Guy Named Joe,"" ""Brigadoon"" and ""The Caine Mutiny."" In 1947, Johnson married former actor Eve Lynn Johnson, who had previously been married to a close friend of Johnson's, Keenan Wynn. The two did not have children and divorced in 1968, according to TCM.com . Johnson had a daughter, Schuyler Van Johnson, by another woman, according to TCM.com. As Johnson entered middle age, his features grew heavy but he still managed to find offbeat roles in films including ""The Bottom of the Bottle,"" an unabashed melodrama in which he played an alcoholic, and ""23 Paces to Baker Street"" as a blind detective. As film roles became scarce, Johnson filled the gaps with stage work. He appeared in ""The Music Man"" in London, England, in 1961 and returned to Broadway in 1962 for ""Come on Strong."" In Woody Allen's 1985 comedy, ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" Johnson played one of the actors trapped inside the film screen in a parody of sorts of films from the 1930s. In 1987, Johnson was praised for his work in the Broadway production of ""La Cage aux Folles."" He last appeared on stage four years ago in ""Love Letters"" in a community theater in nearby Suffern, New York, but decided afterward that he would do no more, Bleiweiss said. ""He said he had seen it and done it all and now he was just going to sit back and take it easy. Those were his words,"" she said. Johnson retained much of his youthful energy as he grew older, and became a frequent interview subject on the old days of Hollywood and his lengthy career, TCM.com said. Bleiweiss said she met Johnson when he moved into the home, where she was a case manager at the time. ""He still was tall and striking,"" she said. ""He was one of the all-time old actors."" His ability to communicate was hampered by the loss of his hearing. Instead, he passed the time by painting, needlepoint and crocheting, she said. Though he didn't cook, he loved watching cooking shows and reruns of ""The Golden Girls,"" she said. Bleiweiss said Johnson was estranged from his daughter and stepchildren for most of his life, but children brightened his day. ""When he saw them, he'd smile and wave to them,"" she said. ""It always brought a smile to his face."" A private service will be held.","Johnson died Friday morning at 92 in an assisted-living facility in Nyack, New York .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- For three years, family, friends and her college sorority sisters have been looking for Jennifer Kesse, wondering what happened to her. Jennifer Kesse would be 26 now. She has been missing since January 24, 2006. Last week, on the third anniversary of Kesse's disappearance, an inmate in a Florida prison said he might have the answer. David Russ, a convicted killer being held at the Seminole County Jail, spoke last week with the missing woman's father, Drew Kesse, claiming he had information that could lead to a break in the case. Details are being withheld from the public. In a jailhouse phone call with CNN, Russ hinted he'd eavesdropped on other inmates. He also was outspoken about his skepticism toward investigators. ""The investigators have messed this case up from the beginning and cannot be trusted,"" he said. That's why he asked to speak directly with the missing woman's father, he said. Orlando police are just as skeptical of Russ. They said he provided information they already had. ""His information is not some big break in the case,"" said Sgt. Barbara Jones of the Orlando Police Department. ""We are still hoping for new tips that could lead us to finding Jennifer Kesse."" The 24-year-old financial adviser was just back from a Caribbean vacation with her boyfriend and was getting back into her routine. She went to work at her new job, came home to her new condominium and called her parents.  Watch an update on the case » . At 10 p.m., she called her boyfriend, who lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Then, her family believes, she went to bed. The next morning, she got up and showered for work. Her clothes were neatly laid out on her bed, her family says, suggesting she may have tried on a few outfits before deciding what to wear to the office. Then, she disappeared, her family said. She did not show up for work that Tuesday morning and her employer reported her missing. Police found Kesse's Chevy Malibu two days later. It was parked in a gated lot about one mile down the road from the condominium complex where she lived. Inside the vehicle, police found some of Kesse's personal items, but her purse, wallet, two cell phones and briefcase were missing. The car doors were locked and the car keys were not found. Police later released a video surveillance tape of the car being parked in the lot by someone other than Kesse. The grainy video partially shows a person walking away from the car, past a parking lot gate. Police are uncertain if this person of interest is a man or a woman, because the image is partially obscured by the gate. The person is described as 5 feet 4 inches, with a short haircut, wearing light-colored clothes and dark shoes. The video is time and date-stamped at noon on the day Kesse disappeared. Forensic tests on the vehicle came back inconclusive, Sgt. Jones said. No blood or other trace evidence was found to show that Kesse had been injured in the vehicle. Drew Kesse said that every Tuesday, landscapers worked at the condo complex near his daughter's parking space. The landscapers said they didn't see Kesse leaving her apartment and getting into her car, which she did every weekday morning between 7:30 and 7:45 a.m. ""The only theory we could come up with is that she walked out her front door and was kidnapped somewhere between her front door and the parking lot where her car was. We think since the landscapers didn't see her, she must not have even made it out of the hallways or stairwells of the condo complex,"" Drew Kesse said. He added that there weren't any surveillance cameras in the hallways or stairwells at the time his daughter was living there. Sgt. Jones said investigators have developed forensic evidence from Kesse's car that could someday match with a person of interest and identify a suspect. Police have also released a photo of a green clover tattoo on Kesse's left hip. Anyone with information leading to Jennifer Kesse or the person responsible for her disappearance is asked to call the tip line at 1-800-423-TIPS. The reward is $10,000. Kesse would be 26 years old and has blonde hair, green eyes, is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds.","Inmate calls missing woman's father, says he heard other inmates talking .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Terrorists are likely to use a weapon of mass destruction somewhere in the world in the next five years, a blue-ribbon panel assembled by Congress has concluded. Police watch over travelers at New York's Grand Central Terminal before Thanksgiving. They are more likely to use a biological weapon than a nuclear one -- and the results could be devastating, the chairman of the commission told CNN. ""The consequences of a biological attack are almost beyond comprehension. It would be 9/11 times 10 or a hundred in terms of the number of people who would be killed,"" former Sen. Bob Graham said. He cited the flu virus that killed millions of people in 1918 as an example. ""Today it is still in the laboratory, but if it should get out and into the hands of scientists who knew how to use it for a violent purpose, we could have multiple times the 40 million people who were killed 100 years ago,"" he said.  Watch how officials worry about a biological terror attack » . The U.S. government ""needs to move more aggressively to limit"" the spread of biological weapons, the commission said in its report. Graham warned that such measures would be costly, but were necessary. ""The leadership of this country and the world will have to decide how much of a priority ... they place on avoiding the worst weapons in the world getting in the hands of the worst people in the world,"" he said. ""It is not going to be cheap. It is not going to be accomplished without some sacrifices. It won't be accomplished without putting this issue ahead of some other competing national and international goals. But I think our safety and security depend upon doing so,"" he added. Graham said a biological attack was more likely than a nuclear one because it would be easier to carry out. Biological weapons ""are more available,"" he said. ""Anthrax is a natural product of dead animals. Other serious pathogens are available in equally accessible forms."" ""There are so many scientists who have the skills to convert a pathogen from benign, helpful purposes into an illicit, very harmful weapon,"" he added. But the commission warned that there is also a threat of nuclear terrorism, both because more countries are developing nuclear weapons and because some existing nuclear powers are expanding their arsenals. ""Terrorist organizations are intent on acquiring nuclear weapons,"" said the report, which was published Tuesday on the Internet and will be officially released Wednesday. CNN obtained a copy of the report Monday evening. It cited testimony before the commission from former Sen. Sam Nunn, who said that the ""risk of a nuclear weapon being used today is growing, not receding."" The report recommends a range of measures, including increased security and awareness at biological research labs and strengthening international treaties against the spread of biological and nuclear weapons. ""Many biological pathogens and nuclear materials around the world are poorly secured -- and thus vulnerable to theft by those who would put these materials to harmful use, or would sell them on the black market to potential terrorists,"" the report warned. The commission expressed particular concern about the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea, and about Pakistan, which it described as ""the intersection of nuclear weapons and terrorism."" While observing that Pakistan is a U.S. ally, the report said, ""the next terrorist attack against the United States is likely to originate from within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas"" in Pakistan. The tribal areas lie in northwest Pakistan where the government exerts little control; the United States says it is a haven for militants from both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. Congress created the commission to investigate and report on WMD and terrorism in line with a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, which compiled a report on the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. Commissioners heard testimony from more than 250 experts from around the world over the course of their six-month investigation. CNN's Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","NEW: Next terror attack on U.S. likely to originate in Pakistan tribal areas, report says .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israeli forces shelled a house where they had ordered about 100 Palestinian civilians to take shelter, killing about 30 people and wounding many more, witnesses told the U.N. Ambulance drivers wait for Israel and the Red Cross to give them the green light Thursday to leave Gaza City. Israel Defense Forces said it is looking into the allegations. ""Credible eyewitness accounts"" described the incident, which occurred in the volatile Gaza City suburb of Zeitoun, said Allegra Pacheco, deputy head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for the Palestinian territories. Pacheco spoke to CNN on Friday. Witnesses reported that ""about 100 civilians were evacuated"" to a house Sunday, and the structure was shelled Monday, she said. The witnesses told the U.N. that two of the survivors said their children died. ""There was no order given to move civilians from one building into another,"" Israeli security sources said. However, Pacheco said, ""The eyewitness accounts that we have received state that the IDF ordered them to go into this house.""  See images from the conflict (Warning: graphic images) » . Officials are simply passing along witness reports and not making ""accusations of deliberate actions or any legal conclusions on the part of the IDF,"" Pacheco said. ""There needs to be further fact-finding on what occurred in this house,"" she said, adding that U.N. officials have yet to speak to the IDF and the Israeli government. Her remarks came a day after the International Committee of the Red Cross issued a blunt press release saying ambulances obtained access to several houses in Zeitoun ""affected by Israel shelling,"" days after they asked to go into the neighborhood. The release slammed Israel -- an uncharacteristic move for the agency, which is known for its neutrality and quiet, behind-the-scenes activities. According to the release, the ICRC had wanted ""safe passage for ambulances"" to the neighborhood since Saturday, but didn't receive IDF permission until Wednesday. The ICRC and the Palestine Red Crescent Society ""found four small children next to their dead mothers in one of the houses. They were too weak to stand up on their own. One man was also found alive, too weak to stand up. In all, there were 12 corpses lying on mattresses,"" the ICRC said.  Watch how the conflict is taking a toll on children » . Rescue teams found 15 wounded people and three corpses in other houses, said the ICRC, which casts the shelling as a single incident. ""The ICRC believes that in this instance the Israeli military failed to meet its obligation under international humanitarian law to care for and evacuate the wounded. It considers the delay in allowing rescue services access unacceptable,"" the ICRC said. Pacheco said she could not say if the incident witnesses described to the U.N. was the same incident in the ICRC report. But they took place in the same area, she said. ""In the Zeitoun area, it's been a closed area, and there has been fighting and there have been injured. There are other homes and buildings where there were injured who were not evacuated,"" she said. Witnesses told the U.N. they had been calling for ambulances to collect dead and wounded people in the Zeitoun buildings, she said. ""This was very much similar to what the ICRC reported yesterday as to what the medical personnel found when they went into the neighborhood,"" Pacheco said. The Israeli army built earthen walls that made ambulance access to the neighborhood impossible, the ICRC said. ""The children and the wounded had to be taken to the ambulances on a donkey cart,"" the ICRC said. Pierre Wettach, the ICRC's head of delegation for Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, called the shelling incident ""shocking.""  See how the Gaza conflict unfolded » . ""The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded. Neither did they make it possible for us or the Palestine Red Crescent to assist the wounded,"" he said in the ICRC news release. Pacheco on Friday described ""a serious protection crisis"" in Gaza where civilians are ""very vulnerable"" to death and injury. ""There is no safe space for civilians. There are no bomb shelters, safe havens, places to flee,"" she said.","Israeli sources denied it ordered civilians moved ""from one building into another""

Syed, a junior at Harvard University majoring in government, is an editorial editor at The Harvard Crimson as well as a senior editor and columnist for the Harvard-MIT journal on Islam and society, Ascent. She is chairwoman of the Harvard Institute of Politics Policy Group on Racial Profiling. Nafees Syed says President Obama's early words and actions send a powerful, positive signal to Muslims. CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- President Obama has given the Muslim community around the world the message we have been waiting for. He reassured Muslims in America that ""We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and nonbelievers."" For those like me who were critical of his standoffish attitude toward Islam during his campaign, this signaled a welcome change. Even more important was his subsequent statement: ""To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect."" In traveling throughout Western Europe in the past two years, I heard several anti-American comments; these Europeans were challenging me, a Muslim, about American foreign policy in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan. In Muslim countries, I've heard admiring comments about how great it must be to live in a rich country like America, followed by accusations that, ""your President Bush doesn't like us Muslims."" As a Muslim-American, I have found myself in a difficult position. In America, I've had to explain Islam to other Americans, and abroad, I've had to explain America to those in the Muslim world. Obama has done all Americans a favor by extending a hand of friendship to the Muslim world. For me personally, it has alleviated the pain of witnessing the country I love engage in a foreign policy that I could not approve of as a Muslim and as an American -- a foreign policy that created mutual distrust between Americans and Muslims. And Obama has followed up on his statements with actions. In his first steps as president, Obama has initiated the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison, called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq and appointed former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, well-respected for his role in the Northern Ireland peace process, as special envoy for the Middle East. For the past few weeks, I've heard overwhelming praise from Muslims for Obama's recent actions. Obama has recognized a key fact that former President George W. Bush did not: Muslims in America and elsewhere are strongly affected by the situation of other Muslims in the world. There is a popular saying of the Prophet Mohammed's that the Muslim community is like one body: If one part hurts, the entire body feels the pain. Muslims are very aware of this message and, in the last 20 years, three conflicts have continuously dominated the Muslim consciousness: Chechnya, Kashmir and, most notably, Palestine. Obama recognized this when he chose his first interview as president to be with a reporter from Al-Arabiya, indicating he would actively engage Arab media. The Palestinian-Israeli issue dominated the interview, with Obama promising to work toward a solution involving both sides of the conflict. To understand the challenge Obama faces in changing America's role in the conflict, one must realize the situation he walked into as president. Muslims around the world were watching the suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians in a Gaza military campaign conducted with a green light from the Bush administration. Obama is essentially trying to rebuild a relationship that has been destroyed. However, Obama's tone of respect and not condescension, a clear break with the past, improves the chances that such a relationship could arise. His interview with Al-Arabiya was filled with reassuring statements that America is ""ready to initiate a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest,"" that ""the language we use has to be a language of respect."" After years of hearing rhetoric of ""a crusade"" and ""Islamofascism"" from the U.S. government, Obama's policy of listening, not dictating, has generated optimism in the Muslim world. I am sure that the Muslim world will respond with goodwill as well. Already, Obama is very well-respected there for his intelligence, eloquence and experience living in the largest Muslim country, Indonesia. Muslims abroad are just as willing as those in America to taste his message of hope and change. To win over the skeptics abroad, Obama will just have to do what he is doing in America: reach out to all sides for solutions and follow up his words with concrete action. In the meantime, the next few weeks will see Muslims around the world taking the hand America is extending after a long hiatus. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nafees Syed.","Nafees Syed: Obama is reaching out to Muslim world with words, actions .

"BAIDOA, Somalia (CNN) -- Somali president Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed Tuesday appointed a new prime minister -- but the previous prime minister is refusing to accept his dismissal. Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, in a photo from August, could face sanctions from Kenya. The Somali parliament on Monday backed Nur Hassan Hussein, who has been prime minister for about 13 months, in his power struggle with the president. Tuesday, the president named Mohamed Mohamud Guled, a close ally of the transitional federal government, as the new Somali prime minister. The move is likely to deepen the political impasse in a country already struggling with an Islamist revolt, a refugee crisis and rampant lawlessness that has fueled a wave of piracy off the Horn of Africa. Somalia has been without an effective central government since 1991. The United Nations-backed transitional government took office after Ethiopian troops ousted an Islamist government at the end of 2006, but controls little of the country outside the southwestern city of Baidoa. Yusuf said Sunday he was firing Hussein for being ineffective. Hussein said the president did not have the power to fire him. The vast majority of members of parliament backed Hussein Monday in a vote of confidence. But Tuesday Yusuf announced he had ""decided to appoint the new premier to pull the country out of the current violence and non-functioning government."" He said Guled would form a Cabinet, which the president would appoint without asking parliament to confirm it. Kenya warned it could impose sanctions against Yusuf on Tuesday, saying the power struggle between him and Hassan endangers peace efforts in Somalia. Kenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula singled out Yusuf in a sharply worded statement that called his current standoff with Hassan ""totally destructive, unhelpful to the region and to Somali society in general."" Wetangula said Yusuf and his family could face targeted sanctions over his Sunday decision to sack Hassan. ""President Abdullahi Yusuf is a party to the summit deceleration and the Djibouti peace process and should not therefore take any unilateral decisions which hinder the attainment of peace in Somalia,"" Wetangula said. ""The current peace initiatives are at a critical stage and require support of all the peace loving Somalis and the region as a whole. The deviation from this path is certainly to bound to jeopardize the peace process."" Kenya is a major player in international efforts to stabilize Somalia. The chaos in Somalia has driven sharply higher numbers of desperate people to seek passage across the Gulf of Aden, with smugglers packing as many as 150 people into boats as small as 25 feet (8 meters) for the crossing, according to a spokesman for the aid group Doctors Without Borders. ""It is a very, very dangerous journey and the smugglers are very, very cruel with the refugees,"" Andreas Koutepas, a field coordinator for the group in Yemen, told CNN's ""Inside Africa."" ""We have many incidents of stabbing or people suffocating and just being thrown in the sea."" In addition, smugglers want to avoid detection by the Yemeni coast guard -- ""So sometimes they just disembark people in deep water,"" Koutepas said. ""And since most of the people cannot swim, they just drown."" At least 24 people have drowned off Yemen in December so far, he said, and another half-dozen are unaccounted for. But since many of the refugees ""consider themselves already dead"" if they remain, ""They take their chances with this trip, no matter how dangerous the trip is. It's a quite tragic situation.""

"STOCKHOLM, Sweden (CNN) -- Four men behind a Swedish file-sharing Web site used by millions to exchange movies and music have been found guilty of collaborating to violate copyright law in a landmark court verdict in Stockholm. A Pirate Bay server, confiscated by police last year, on display in Stockholm's Technical Museum. The four defendants -- Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm Warg, Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi and Carl Lundstrom, three founders and one patron of The Pirate Bay -- were sentenced to one year in jail and also ordered to pay 30 million kronor ($3.6 million) in damages to several major media companies including Warner Brothers, Columbia, Twentieth Century Fox, Sony BMG and EMI.  The defendants are free without restrictions while they appeal the judgment. The Pirate Bay allows users to exchange files including movies, music, games and software, but does not host the files itself. It claims more than 3.5 million registered users. The court case, which involved both a criminal case and a civil claim brought by the media companies, marks a key victory for anti-piracy campaigners, who had long targeted the Web site. Should the perpetrators of Internet piracy be punished? Have your say . The year-long prison terms are for violating Swedish law, while the damages are compensation to the media giants in the civil case -- though the court ordered the men to pay just one-third of the 110 million kronor ($13 million) which the companies had asked for. Friday's verdict did not include an order to shut down The Pirate Bay site. Its owners have consistently shrugged off legal threats and police raids, posting letters from entertainment industry lawyers on their Web site with mocking responses. When Dreamworks studio demanded that the site act over file-sharing of Dreamworks' movie ""Shrek 2,"" The Pirate Bay threatened to sue for harassment and lodge a formal complaint ""for sending frivolous legal threats."" ""It is the opinion of us and our lawyers that you are ... morons,"" the response continued, suggesting that studio representatives perform a sexual act. The response closed with an obscenity. Site owners dismissed the effects of a police raid in 2006, saying the site had been down longer on other occasions due to illness or drunkenness than when ""the U.S. and Swedish government forces the police to steal our servers ... yawn."" But Magnus Eriksson, who in 2003 co-founded the ""loosely formed group of theorists, artists and programmers"" that spawned The Pirate Bay, says there are serious issues at stake. He does not think copyrighted material should be free for everyone, ""but that it already is."" ""The control over what people communicate is lost and we have to adapt to this new state of things,"" he said via e-mail. ""To monitor all communications, fight all new digital technologies and spread a culture of fear in what should be a free and open communication network is not a desirable option."" Entertainment companies claim The Pirate Bay has hurt their box office profits, part of an annual loss the Motion Picture Association of America claims to be about $6 billion a year worldwide. ""Hollywood studios are businesses. They're there to make money,"" said association lawyer Thomas Dillon. ""It costs $100 million to make a feature film, so of course they're quite keen to get some back. So I don't accept this argument that there's some benefit to culture in allowing people to make copies of commercial films and getting them for free."" Monique Wadsted, a Swedish lawyer for the MPAA, said The Pirate Bay was also harming individual artists. A victory for the entertainment companies ""will, of course, be for all authors all around the world, some kind of redress... because what is going on now is actually a plundering of the author's works,"" she said via e-mail. ""If some authors find it good to market their products using file-sharing or whatever, they are free to do that,"" she added. ""But that is not what is happening at the moment. What's happening at the moment is that authors' and rights holders' works are file-shared against their will and that is not acceptable."" She argued that The Pirate Bay ""is specifically tailored for copyright infringement."" The prosecution claims the site provides a search engine that helps people find and download copyrighted material including movies, music and games -- in effect, enabling copyright theft. The site's supporters say they're doing nothing wrong under Swedish law because the site doesn't actually put the copyrighted material on the Web site. Internet piracy and illegal downloading from peer-to-peer systems are some of the biggest piracy problems in Europe, the MPAA argues. Internet piracy is growing at a faster rate in Europe than anywhere else in the world, the MPAA says, because of increased broadband use, weak laws, and lenient public perceptions. Sweden's official efforts to battle online piracy have been weak, the MPAA says. Eriksson, the co-founder of the group that led to The Pirate Bay, says the MPAA's argument that file-sharing hurts movie studio revenues is ""nonsense."" ""Cinema is doing better than ever,"" he said by e-mail. ""They only claim this because they calculate losses by looking at the number of downloads and imagining that all of them would have been a purchase if they hadn't been downloaded first."" Eriksson said what was at stake in the Swedish courtroom was the future of the Internet itself. ""The Internet revolution meant that we created a global network where any digital entity could connect and exchange information with any other,"" he said. ""Anti-piracy efforts must be seen in the light of a counter-revolution against this that goes all the way to the very infrastructure of the net."" He suggested that even if The Pirate Bay is convicted of facilitating making works public through its indexing service, which he does not expect, Internet piracy will not stop. ""The prosecution can't understand that The Pirate Bay is just one stratification of a social and technological change that is decentralized,"" he said. ""Piracy does not have a head that you can cut off, and The Pirate Bay is just a technology allowing communication, a part of the Internet infrastructure."" CNN's Neil Curry in Stockholm, Sweden, and Mairi Mackay in London, England, contributed to this report.","Four men sentenced to a year, fined $3.6M in Sweden over file-sharing Web site .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal law enforcement authorities are discussing what to do with the lone surviving pirate captured Sunday off Somalia's coast after a successful military rescue abruptly ended a five-day hostage standoff at sea. A Kenyan police officer guards the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama at a Mombasa port Sunday. According to sources familiar with the case, U.S. government officials are weighing potential legal hurdles they may face if the young Somali captive is flown to New York or Washington to face federal criminal charges. Officially, the government is virtually mum on the discussions. ""The Justice Department continues to review the evidence and other issues to determine whether to seek prosecution of this individual in the United States,"" said Dean Boyd, spokesman for the Justice Department National Security Division. Sources who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to discuss the matter said the detained Somali youth remains in military custody, but is likely to be turned over eventually to the FBI for transport to the United States.  Watch how the Navy deals with pirates » . New York-based FBI agents are assisting Nairobi-based agents in collecting evidence and conducting interviews. Some officials say it appears most likely the captive initially would be flown to New York to stand trial. However, sources stress no decisions have been made on when or where the young pirate would face justice. Investigators face the early and potentially difficult task of determining whether the Somali suspect is at least 18 years of age. Initial reports from the Horn of Africa have indicated the young man is anywhere from 16 to 19 years old. Officials note that authoritatively establishing his identity and date of birth in a lawless country, where records are often lost or burned, if they ever existed at all, may be problematic. Even if officials determine the Somali youth is a juvenile, he could be presented to a magistrate in a U.S. District Court. Justice Department records indicate such occurrences are rare, with juveniles accounting for less than 1 percent of criminal defendants. The latest available figures show among the thousands of federal prisoners, about half of the 200-plus defendants 17 or younger are held for trial as adults, while the other half are detained as juveniles. Whether adult or juvenile, the Somali captive could be charged under an international treaty to which the United States is a signatory that carries penalties of up to life in prison.  Watch how U.S. could deal with captured pirate » . The 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation has been used to prosecute pirates in other countries. The agreement allows for pirates and hostage takers on the high seas to be prosecuted in any country which signed the treaty, without regard to which national flag a ship was flying. Former FBI official and CNN contributor Tom Fuentes, who supervised international operations for the FBI, recalls agents providing critical help in winning the conviction in a Kenyan courtroom of 10 pirates captured in 2006 with the help of the U.S. military. The USS Nassau had come to the aid of an Indian ship on which pirates were holding 16 Indian hostages. Shots were fired, prompting the pirates to surrender. ""The government of Kenya wanted to prosecute the case, so the Justice Department and State Department agreed to that. We said 'Let's teach them to fish',"" Fuentes said.  Watch report on pirates' deadly new goal » . He said FBI agents ended up spending six months working with Kenyan authorities on how to conduct interviews, handle and protect evidence, and shape a prosecution that would stand up in any courtroom in the world. The pirates were convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison. Officials familiar with the current case say the lone Somali suspect in U.S. military custody could be turned over to Kenya or another country in the region if barriers to a U.S. prosecution appear to be daunting. However, because the ship was U.S.-flagged and the seized sea captain was a U.S. citizen, federal authorities will want to prosecute the case on U.S. soil if at all possible, according to one federal law enforcement official. Another official said it was probable that if a charge against the Somali is filed in a U.S. court, the action would be filed under a court seal and kept secret from the public until the suspect suddenly appears in court to hear the charge read by a magistrate judge. Officials indicate such developments are not likely to occur soon.","Legal hurdles abound if Somali captive is flown to United States for prosecution .

"(CNN) -- President Obama's friendly interactions with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has set off a wave of controversy, but analysts said the leaders' next steps will show if relations have truly improved or if Obama was overstepping boundaries. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez presents a book to President Obama at the Summit of the Americas. Chavez and Obama were both at the Summit of the Americas, which ended Sunday in Trinidad and Tobago. On the first day, Obama reached out his hand to Chavez and was seen smiling and patting the Venezuelan leader on the shoulder as the two shook hands. ""With this same hand I greeted Bush eight years ago, I want to be your friend,"" Chavez said, his office reported. On the second day, as cameras jockeyed for position, Chavez got up and gave Obama a book, ""The Open Veins of Latin America,"" which documents centuries of American abuse in the region. After the exchange, the book skyrocketed to become one of Amazon's best-sellers. Obama joked about the move at a news conference Sunday, saying while he had meetings with all the leaders involved, ""I think it's just that President Chavez is better at positioning the cameras."" ""And in all these conversations, here's what I emphasized, that we're not going to agree on every issue, but that, as long as we are respectful of democratic processes, as long as we're respectful of principles of sovereignty for all nations, that we can find areas where we can work in common,"" he said. Relations between the United States and Venezuela grew progressively worse under the presidencies of Chavez and George W. Bush. Chavez -- whose anti-U.S. rhetoric has included calling Bush the ""devil"" -- announced Saturday he is considering naming an ambassador to the United States, signaling a potential shift in the tense relations between the two nations. Chavez expelled the American ambassador in September, prompting the United States to expel Venezuela's ambassador. Sen. John Ensign, R-Nevada, told CNN on Sunday it was ""irresponsible"" for Obama to have been seen ""laughing and joking"" with Chavez. ""This is a person who is one of the most anti-American leaders in the entire world,"" Ensign said on ""State of the Union."" ""He is a brutal dictator, and human rights violations are very, very prevalent in Venezuela. And you have to be careful.""  Watch criticism of the meeting » . Republican Newt Gingrich joined the criticism Monday, saying enemies of the United States will use Obama's friendly encounter with Chavez as propaganda. ""Everywhere in Latin America, enemies of America are going to use the picture of Chavez smiling and being with the president as proof that Chavez is now legitimate, that he is acceptable,"" the former House leader said on NBC's ""Today"" show. But Democrats such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota downplayed the moment, saying, ""All the president did was shake his hand like George Bush [did]."" Obama's senior adviser said Sunday the administration isn't worried about how the gesture is perceived. ""I'm not concerned about the message that it sends. I'm concerned about what flows from it. Words and handshakes are nice, but they're not enough,"" David Axelrod said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Stephen Hayes, a CNN contributor and writer for the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard, said it's not the handshake that irks Republicans but that Obama ""seemed to actually be enjoying it."" ""Conservatives at least were looking for something from the president who would have said, 'Hey, enough is enough, we want to go forward. We want to put the arguments of the past in the past, but you've got to own up to the arguments you've made,' "" Hayes said Monday on CNN. Jennifer McCoy, director of the Carter Center's Americas Program, said Obama was trying to send a message that he wants to start a new beginning with Latin America. ""So President Chavez is also responding to this new atmosphere, this new style and attitude that Obama is presenting and needed to respond in kind,"" she said. McCoy, who briefly spoke with Chavez at the summit, said he told her he is ready to give Obama a chance and see if they can have a more cooperative relationship. But she said, ""I don't expect it's going to be smooth sailing. President Chavez's whole foreign policy is predicated on challenging U.S. leadership."" Obama went into office arguing that relations with Latin America had turned sour and that the U.S. needed to form new partnerships. David Gergen, CNN's senior political analyst, said Obama is trying to make good on that pledge. ""I think most political advisers would tell the president, you know, it's fine to shake hands, hold the smiles,"" he said, adding that the gesture shows some inexperience on Obama's part. ""What the real test here is going to be in policies and in the actions. And I think Barack Obama has to somehow make a balance between being open, reaching out and also not surrendering or retreating on basic American principles and on showing some toughness,"" Gergen said. William Bennett, a CNN contributor and Republican strategist, agreed it's too early to tell if anything has changed. ""Image is one thing. Reality is another. Substance is another. Things that need to get accomplished is another. That will be the test,"" Bennett said. Obama said Sunday he didn't know how the images from this weekend would play politically, and he indicated he really didn't care. ""One of the benefits of my campaign and how I've been trying to operate as president, I don't worry about the politics. I try to figure out what's right in terms of American interest, and on this one I think I'm right,"" he said. CNN's Kristi Keck, Suzanne Malveaux and Alexander Mooney contributed to this report.","President Obama, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez shake hands at summit .

"(CNN) -- Shark attacks on humans were at the lowest levels in half a decade last year, and a Florida researcher says hard economic times may be to blame. Fewer people in the water means less chance for sharks to attack, ichthyologist George Burgess says. Sharks attacked 59 people in 2008, the lowest number of attacks since 57 in 2003, according to George Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File, part of the Florida Museum of Natural History on the University of Florida campus in Gainesville. There were 71 attacks in 2007. ""One can't help but think that the downturn in the economy played a part in it,"" Burgess said. Fewer people, especially outside of the United States, have the resources to go to the beach, he said. ""To have a shark attack, you have to have humans and sharks in the water at the same time,"" Burgess said. ""If you have a reduction in the number of people in the water, you're going to have a reduction in the opportunities for people and sharks to get together."" ""We noticed similar declines during the recession that followed the events of 2001, despite the fact that human populations continued to rise,"" the ichthyologist said. Sharks killed four people in 2008, Burgess said: one in California, one in Australia and two in Mexico. Forty-one of the 59 attacks worldwide came in the United States, and 32 of those occurred in Florida. Surfers accounted for 57 percent of shark attacks, swimmers and waders were the targets in 36 percent of the attacks, and divers the rest, he said. Burgess said the U.S. tends to see more attacks because of a large number of surfers, who are a favorite target of sharks. And neither the economy nor the attacks tend to keep American surfers from practicing their sport. ""All they have to do is drive to the beach with the board and get into the water, and the rest is free,"" he said. And while an attack may make them a bit more wary, he said, ""I've yet to find a surfer who says he or she won't go back into the water after a bite or a nip."" When the economy improves, shark attack numbers are likely to go up again, according to Burgess, predicting the number of attacks in the next decade will surpass those of the past 10 years. ""We're putting so many people in the water that humans are dictating the shark attack situation,"" he said.","Sharks attacked 59 people worldwide in 2008, Florida researcher reports .

"(CNN) -- The massacre of students and a teacher within the seemingly safe hallways of Columbine High School reverberated so strongly that its reflection can be found in the creations of multiple artists, writers, musicians, and filmmakers over the past decade. ""Elephant,"" musician Marilyn Manson, and the bestseller ""Nineteen Minutes"" entered the spotlight post-Columbine. ""It wasn't the first school shooting, but it became the extreme case,"" said Robert Thompson, founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. ""The word 'Columbine' became a word that represented something much, much larger than that particular high school."" Columbine, in some ways, represents the broad insecurity triggered by extreme acts of violence. Littleton, Colorado, is as picturesque as the set of a family film. And thanks in part to the 24-hour news cycle, the world witnessed scenes that appeared to be out of a movie: bloodied victims escaping through windows and frightened teens scurrying to safety as law enforcement descended. Film critic Desson Thomson said films such as Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"" do not have to reach far into the American psyche to tell a tale of horror in a post-Columbine world. ""Columbine is now a little like the way 9/11 is engrained in our cultural perspective, so that something like 'Elephant' doesn't even have to directly allude to it,"" he said. ""Because we were so immersed in Columbine...the filmmakers know that the audience has that reference point, so it doesn't take much to even poke at that for all of that dimension to come swimming through our consciousness."" ""Elephant,"" which won two awards at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003, dramatized a normal day at a high school that is about to become the scene of a planned mass slaughter by a pair of friends. Television shows such as ""Law & Order"" and ""Cold Case"" also delved into the lives of fictitious teens on murderous rampages. But music is the one medium that seemed almost primed for an interpretation of the day's events. Shock rocker Marilyn Manson weathered speculation that his songs may have influenced the pair of young murderers. He addressed the issue in a Rolling Stone magazine article in 1999. ""When it comes down to who's to blame for the high school murders in Littleton, Colorado, throw a rock and you'll hit someone who's guilty,"" Manson wrote. ""We're the people who sit back and tolerate children owning guns, and we're the ones who tune in and watch the up-to-the-minute details of what they do with them."" The spotlight on Manson didn't discourage other artists from referencing Columbine in their songs, music videos and lyrics. Genres from rock to rap reflected on the tragedy. Manson himself released an album titled ""Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)"" that contained songs alluding to the massacre. In the single ""The Nobodies,"" Manson appeared to reiterate statements from his first-person piece in Rolling Stone with the lyrics ""Some children died the other day, We fed machines and then we prayed, Puked up and down in morbid faith,You should have seen the ratings that day."" Music, TV and film were not the only media that reacted to the shootings. In 2005, an independent video game developer released ""Super Columbine Massacre RPG!,"" a role-playing game that allowed users to imagine themselves as the Columbine gunmen and act out the violence. Scott Steinberg, publisher of DigitalTrends.com, said the game is not indicative of the game market as a whole. He pointed out that that 85 percent of video games are rated ""E for everyone"" ""E10 plus"" or ""T for Teen."" Fewer violent video games are being produced today, Steinberg said, despite the perception that the industry mostly produces ""spray and slay"" entertainment. ""The industry is becoming a lot more sensitive in realizing that we have a medium that reaches more people than ever,"" Steinberg said. iReport.com: How did Columbine affect you? Littleton, Colorado, was also very much on the mind of bestselling author Jodi Picoult when she came up with the idea for her popular 2007 novel ""Nineteen Minutes."" ""I have three children and I was watching all of them, at different points in their school careers, being bullied,"" she said. ""It got me wondering why, in a post- Columbine world, we haven't figured this out yet."" Picoult's novel told the story of a bullied, alienated high school student who commits an act of violence. Records have since been released disputing that Klebold and Harris were outcasts or the targets of bullying. Picoult said it was powerful for her to speak with Columbine survivors. She received a standing ovation from families in Littleton during a book event held there. ""It was really moving,"" she said. ""You realize that the people who want to talk about it the most are the people who lived through it. The one thing I think we have learned, and the one thing I thing pop culture is good for, is the more that we see it pop up, the more we are reminded that this is a worthy subject.""","Columbine tragedy provided fodder for several creative works .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- Alice Temperley likes to camp. Which is why the British fashion designer, who escapes her London workshop to rusticate in a tepee on her Somerset country estate, was recently commissioned by One & Only Le Saint Géran to erect a similar structure on their beach in Mauritius. ""It's escapism to the nth degree,"" says designer Bill Bensley of the tents at the Four Seasons Tented Camp, in Thailand's Golden Triangle. The 17-foot-high tepee is decked out with beads, streaming ribbons, and embroidered patches -- a look Temperley likens to ""a jewelry box that glistens in the sand."" The resort offers cookouts by the tent -- marshmallows included -- served by a liveried butler. By any definition, this is an indulgent experience, but given its availability in a structure originally designed for the life nomadic, it signals a shift in our perception of both luxury and escapism. Suddenly, a heightened sense of well-being may owe less to four sheltering walls than to a temporary shedding, not just of our inhibitions but also of all the weighty paraphernalia that clutters up a sedentary life. Tents pitched in far-flung locales have always had romantic cachet -- who could forget Meryl Streep and Robert Redford in ""Out of Africa."" And now there's a trend of textile pleasure domes being adapted for use in diverse settings across the globe. ""They provide an experience that you could miss in an ordinary concrete box,"" says designer Bill Bensley of the tents at the Four Seasons Tented Camp, in Thailand's Golden Triangle. ""Guests can hear the sound of elephants munching their way through the jungle. It's escapism to the nth degree."" Travel + Leisure: See the world's best tented camps . That sentiment is evident in Bensley's design for the resort. He drew inspiration from northern Thailand's hill-tribe villages as well as camps he visited in Botswana, and he filled the 15 tents with metal craftwork from local artisans, along with explorer-themed antiques (an old compass, rifles, primitive fishing tools). Like Temperley, Nairobi-based fashion designer Anna Trzebinski is also dabbling in the world of hotels, opening the tented Lemarti's Camp near Kenya's Laikipia Plateau last year. She stitches tents of locally loomed cotton in the same workshop where she creates beaded tunics and accessories inspired by indigenous Kenyan designs. Set on platforms above a river bend, the camp's tents are furnished with tables and beds built with wood from dhow boats, and decorated with African-themed found objets d'art: crocodile skulls, elephant shoulder blades, beaded walking sticks and clubs. ""For me, a tent should be the veil between you and Mother Africa, a sheer shield to protect but not in any way disconnect you from her presence. To be under canvas on a comfortable bed, with the smell of acacia blossoms -- in the old safari days this was intoxicating enough, but now we have the ability to improve on the concept."" And that's exactly what Banyan Tree is doing with one of its latest resorts, the Banyan Tree Maldives Madivaru, on a coral atoll in the Maldives. Created by Dharmali Kusumadi, one of the group's head designers, it's by far the most cosseting tented property available today. Only 18 guests at a time can stay on the private island. Rooms come in the form of three conjoined tents facing a cobalt-blue lagoon: a king-size platform bed dominates the air-conditioned sleeping tent, while the bathing pavilion has a claw-foot tub. A butler and massage therapist are at guests' beck and call. Spas, too, are employing tents to help travelers abandon worldly cares. In Arizona's Sonoran Desert, Miraval Tucson Resort & Spa guests take treatments in one of six new tents styled by Irish-born designer Clodagh. ""For me, a tent evokes impermanence,"" she says. ""It reflects the impermanence of the spa treatment as well."" Set in a botanical garden shaded by paloverde trees, each of the tents has natural cleft-stone flooring, an acacia-wood bench, and walls made of saguaro and ocotillo cacti. Tipping the indulgence scale, Taj Hotels' Rambagh Palace, in Jaipur, has put up two new spa suite tents patterned after a 16th-century Mughal encampment. When India's royalty went camping, their tasseled tents were made of velvet and embroidered silk. Devised by husband-and-wife hotel design team Amit and Shalini Gehlot, the billowing pavilions contain handwoven carpets, royal pennants, and love swings made from salvaged shesham wood. And if that's not adequate escapism, this month Taj opens Banjaar Tola, a safari lodge with 18 tented suites in the bamboo forests of Madhya Pradesh, a four-hour drive from Jabalpur. Created by one of India's top architects, Sanjay Prakash, each tent has bamboo floors, solar-powered heated pools, and traditional artwork from nearby Chattisgarh.

"(CNN) -- In the wake of the tragic shootings at Columbine High School, some schools across the country turned themselves into near-fortresses. Kindergarden students huddle beneath desks in a lockdown drill. Such drills have become common. They installed metal detectors and security cameras, banned backpacks, required students to carry IDs and posted police in the hallways -- all in the name of keeping students safe. Now, 10 years after those highly publicized shootings in which two young men killed 13 people and themselves, school security has taken another dramatic turn. Some of the noticeable security measures remain, but experts say the country is exploring a new way to protect kids from in-school violence: administrators now want to foster school communities that essentially can protect themselves with or without the high-tech gear. ""The first and best line of defense is always a well-trained, highly alert staff and student body,"" said Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, an Ohio-based firm specializing in school security. ""The No. 1 way we find out about weapons in schools is not from a piece of equipment [such as a metal detector] but from a kid who comes forward and reports it to an adult that he or she trusts.""  See how many homicides have occurred in schools since 1992 » . The Obama administration plans to create secure schools indirectly, by improving overall education, getting kids more involved in their studies and strengthening school communities, said William Modzeleski, a high-ranking official in the U.S. Department of Education who handles school security. The trend is reflected in security funding, some of which comes from federal grants. Allocations for the Department of Education's Safe and Drug-Free Schools program were cut by a third between 1999 and 2008, to about $294.8 million last year. And a program that has put about 6,300 police officers in public schools since Columbine was scrapped by the U.S. Department of Justice after 2005, according to Corey Ray, a spokesman for the department. Ray said he's hopeful President Obama's stimulus package will put more police officers in schools. They act as law enforcement officers as well as counselors and mentors to students, he said. Meanwhile, money for a school counseling grant program has increased since Columbine, with $52 million set aside for this fiscal year, compared to $20 million in 2000, the first year the program was funded, according to budget numbers compiled for CNN by the Department of Education. So while there's more money available for counseling, there's still been a steady decline in federal spending for other aspects of school security. Some critics say a lack of available funding for high-tech security upgrades may be behind the shift toward less-costly and more indirect violence prevention measures. ""Right now, the economic situation is affecting [school security funding]. Particularly the technology components of security are going to suffer because there's just not going to be the money to do these kinds of things,"" said Dan Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators. ""We're in the process of laying off teachers and staff."" Trump, the security consultant in Ohio, said schools have lost their focus on security since Columbine. But he added that many effective security programs cost little or no money -- only the time it takes to train teachers and students how to spot potential problems and how to react if a shooting were to occur. While metal detectors may not be the best tools to prevent school shootings, they still can be useful in some crime-ridden school districts and, along with security cameras, should not be abandoned entirely, Modzeleski said. Some evidence suggests strong school communities -- where kids feel like they can come forward with problems -- can prevent violent crime. A 2008 Secret Service report found that in more than 80 percent of instances of school violence, at least one person, usually a fellow student or peer, had knowledge of the attackers' plans. If people who suspect a problem feel comfortable enough in school to tell a teacher or a principal, then attacks could be prevented, Modzeleski said. After Columbine, many states and school districts made quick moves to increase school security, experts say. Modzeleski said this was a ""kneejerk"" reaction to the tragic, but rare, event; and a decade later, policies are settling into a middle ground. ""Immediately after any of these incidents I think there's the immediate rush for more security,"" he said. ""That's what I would call the kneejerk reaction to any type of these events: 'We need more cops; we need more metal detectors; we need more cameras.' After that settles in, I think people come to their senses and say, 'Hey, if we're going to keep our kids safe in schools, we need more than that.'"" iReport.com: How did Columbine affect you? After Columbine, some states started requiring schools to prepare for school shootings with lockdown drills, much in the way they prepare for fires or other disasters. About once a month in Fort Wayne, Indiana, public and private school students pull down window shades and huddle in the back corners of dark classrooms while their schools go into lockdown mode, said John Weicker, security director at Fort Wayne Community Schools. A school administrator roams the halls to make sure all doors are locked and all students are hidden from what might be a school shooter if this scenario was not a drill. ""You're training the kids,"" Weicker said. Similar drills -- which, in some states, are attended by armed and masked SWAT teams -- are now practiced routinely in nearly three-quarters of schools, according to a recent survey of 445 administrators funded by the American Association of School Administrators. It's difficult to say whether these policies are working, but by some measures, school safety has improved in the decade since Columbine.  Watch parents remember children lost at Columbine » . On average, there have been about half as many deaths per year since Columbine as in the seven school years before the tragedy, according to a 2007 report from the National Center for Education Statistics and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In the school year immediately following the Columbine shootings, the number of in-school homicides dropped from 33 in the 1998-1999 school year to 13 in the 1999-2000 year, the report says. Several experts say the tragedy brought awareness to the issue of school security, which on the whole has been positive. They worry, however, that attention has been waning in the past few years. A 17-year-old student in Fort Wayne, Indiana, however, said that while he is reassured by tight school security, it's a good thing that the Columbine shootings rarely enter his mind. ""There's a couple times that we'll talk about it in like a history class,"" said Travis Armstrong, a high school junior. ""Because that did happen back a while ago, and therefore it is considered history.""","10 years after Columbine, schools are taking a new look at security .
Immediately after the shootings, schools added cameras and metal detectors .
Now they're trying to foster safer and better school communities .
Meanwhile, overall funding for school security has dropped by about a third ."
"(CNN) -- One evening last winter, Mike Harris was watching his local TV news when he saw a segment that caught his attention: Parents were using software to monitor their kids' cell phones. As more kids carry cell phones, some parents use software to monitor their calls and texts. Harris, an investigator for the Child Sex Internet Investigations Unit in Jefferson County, Colorado, thought the service could be a new tool for combating sexual predators. Equipping his phone with the software, Harris posed as an underage child on social-networking sites and began luring pedophiles. He immediately got results. Since then, Harris has made 83 arrests of alleged sexual predators -- 44 of them with the help of the monitoring program. ""It makes life easy for me as an investigator. It saves me hours of time, which obviously means I have more time to go out and catch offenders,"" he said. The software also documents text messages and other data that can be used in court, he said. ""Now all I have to do is go into the account and pull everything out that was done between that sex offender and me."" Programs such as My Mobile Watchdog and Mobile Spy are becoming increasingly popular with parents as more school-age children are carrying cell phones. Parents say the services help them protect their kids against predators and also reduce ""sexting,"" the growing practice of using mobile phones to share sexually explicit text messages and pictures. In 2008, Jessica Logan, a Cincinnati, Ohio, teen, hanged herself after her nude photo, meant for her boyfriend, was sent to teenagers at several high schools, exposing her to ridicule and taunts. The monitoring programs work like this: Once a child's phone is equipped with the software, the parent or law enforcement officer creates a list of contacts -- close relatives, trusted friends -- who are authorized to communicate with the minor's phone. An online file, accessed by the parent, stores all activity related to the child's phone, including text messages and shared photos. Any unauthorized number that contacts the child's phone gets flagged, and the parent or guardian receives a real-time text message alerting them to the infraction. Parents pay a monthly fee -- about $10 -- for the service, which only works on so-called ""smart phones"" with Web access. My Mobile Watchdog also will alert parents if their child has removed the software from their phone. eAgency Mobile Solutions of Newport Beach, California, is the creator of My Mobile Watchdog. Bob Lotter, the company's CEO, said he never imagined the software would become a tool for authorities cracking down on online sexual predators. ""The threat is huge,"" Lotter said. ""There are so many different ways out there for child predators [to find victims] -- through Google, Yahoo, MySpace, Facebook and a host of other sites."" A Lakewood, Colorado, woman said she outfitted her 12-year-old daughter's phone with monitoring software after the girl was sexually assaulted by a man she met on MocoSpace, a mobile chat network. ""I wasn't going to take away her cell phone, and I knew I had to do something,"" said the woman, whose first name is Wendy. CNN.com is not printing her last name in accordance with its policy of not identifying the victims of sexual assault. Wendy said the service has given her more peace of mind and her daughter a greater awareness of the responsibilities of having a cell phone. Other parents haven't been so transparent. James Green of Sulphur, Louisiana, equipped his daughter's cell phone with monitoring software but didn't tell her what it was. He told her the icon was a GPS system. ""I wasn't going to get my 15-year-old a cell phone and not know how she was using it,"" Green said. Over time, Green found the software wasn't just useful for tracking his daughter's behavior; it also helped him discover more about the nature of his child. ""It's good to know how she's treating people and how others are treating her,"" Green said. ""I think it's a caring father that wants to know what's going on in her life ... wanting to know how she feels."" When Green's daughter discovered the software on her phone, she wasn't angry, he said. ""She understood that I cared about her."" A Chandler, Arizona, mother found that monitoring her daughter's phone calls and texts gave her new insight into her daughter's life. ""We talk a lot more about what's going on in her life,"" said Trisha, who requested her last name not be published. ""It's really opened up communication between the two of us."" Some privacy advocates might object to parents digitally eavesdropping on their kids without their children's consent. But an Asheville, North Carolina, mother, who fitted her son's phone with the software without his knowledge, disagrees. ""I monitor my employees at the workplace,"" said the woman, who owns a small business and asked that her name not be disclosed. ""And this is my son. So to me it's not like I'm wiretapping him. Besides, privacy in my house is earned.""","Colorado officer uses cell-phone monitoring software to catch sexual predators .

"Editor's note: CNN contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose forthcoming book is ""Late Edition: A Love Story."" Bob Greene says kin of Columbine victims don't have the luxury of moving on after the 10th anniversary is marked. (CNN) -- The weddings that will never be held. The birthdays when there will be no one to embrace. The first jobs that will never be greeted with a parent's proud smile of congratulations. Those are the things -- the sacred things, perhaps the sole things -- that we should pause to think about Monday. Because while the rest of the world considers anew the meaning of what happened 10 years ago at the school in Littleton, Colorado, the people who matter -- the only people who truly can fathom the meaning -- are the people with the wounds in their hearts that will never quite heal: . The mothers and fathers of the children who were murdered. The brothers and sisters who were left with the empty and soundless spaces in their homes and in their lives. For the rest of us, it's all guesswork, and the anniversary provides a circumscribed time to think about it somberly. But by tomorrow we will have moved on to other concerns, while the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers -- the grandfathers and the grandmothers -- will return to that which they can never wish away: . The weddings that won't ever come. The birthdays when there is only silence. Is it possible to break that April day from 10 years ago into its incremental elements, as if by doing so we will be able to find a possible future remedy? If we think enough about the saturation of our society with violent images, from the movies we watch to the video games our children play to the stories on the evening news -- is that what can explain Columbine? If we dissect the live television coverage of that day when millions stared for hours on end -- was it those unblinking pictures that made the scenes still so hard to shake? Is there a resolution to be discovered in debates about the guns that were used, the need for security checkpoints? Those are all just details, not answers. Those are merely facts to be noted. What is worth paying attention to is that we, as a people, have developed, without really wanting to or knowing we were doing it, the thousand-yard stare that you see in the eyes of certain homicide detectives who have been doing their jobs for a very long time. It is a look of utter numbness -- a look that is the opposite of cynical, a look of sorrowful surrender. It is a look that says, of the bearer of those eyes: . My eyes are dead because I know that what they have witnessed is only prologue. My eyes show nothing because they must be prepared for what they know they will be seeing again. To encounter those eyes -- to see the thousand-yard stare -- in a police officer is one thing. But to see it in a country. ... Yet that is what the many years of nonstop killings have done to us. Columbine -- that word, that label -- is the way we sum up this kind of thing, but labels like that are at core our way of conceding our inability to process the despair. There was murderous madness that came before Columbine, and murderous madness that came after. We tell ourselves on each new occasion that what has happened is shocking, but the word has become all but meaningless. The only genuinely shocking thing would be if the cruelty and the killings were to somehow suddenly cease. We can blame all of this on our modern times veering out of control, if we wish, but it really speaks of something more elemental and dark, of factors beyond our earthly understanding. The most deadly attack upon sons and daughters at a school did not occur at Columbine 10 years ago, or at Virginia Tech two years ago. On May 18, 1927, in Bath Township, Michigan, 44 people, most of them elementary school pupils in their classrooms, were slaughtered by a man who set off a series of bombs and then killed himself to raise his toll to 45. He was a member of the local school board; he was angry about a tax assessment. The madness and the heartache do not belong to a certain era or to a certain place on the map. Nor do the heartache, and the unending echoes of days like those, belong to the rest of us, however honorable we may wish our intentions to be. We -- the rest of us -- will move on by tomorrow. The anniversary will be over. Leaving the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers. And the lesson? The lesson we never seem to learn? It can be found in words that have been quoted and paraphrased many times, in many languages, over many centuries. But still we can't seem to get it right. What is it that we seek? Something that sounds so simple, something like a prayer: . To tame the savageness of man, and make gentle the life of the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Kin of Columbine victims live with the pain every day .
Greene: Most Americans see such violence with numb eyes and can look elsewhere .

"(CNN) -- Police in Boston, Massachusetts, are searching for a man suspected in the murder of one woman and the armed robbery of two others, all of whom, they say, he may have met through their Craigslist ads for personal services. Julissa Brisman, 26, was described as ""a really sweet, goofy, energetic kid."" Officers discovered New York resident Julissa Brisman, 26, unconscious with multiple gunshot wounds at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel on Tuesday night. She was transferred to Boston Medical Center, where she died shortly afterward. Police said Brisman, a model, offered massages via Craigslist, a popular online classified ad service. The confrontation between Brisman and her killer seems to have begun as an attempted robbery, police said. ""It appears that there was a struggle between the victim and the suspect in the threshold of the hotel room immediately prior to the shooting,"" the Boston Police Department said in a statement on its Web site. Police speculate the man may also be responsible for the recent robberies of two other young women who offered personal services via Craigslist. Four days before Brisman's slaying, a 29-year-old woman was robbed at gunpoint at a Westin Hotel in Boston. Police spokesman Joe Zanola would not disclose the details of her Craigslist ad but said she and Brisman were ""involved in similar professions."" On Thursday night at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, according to Warwick's police chief, Col. Stephen McCartney. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, according to McCartney. He said that no conclusions could be made but allowed that the incident ""may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area."" Matthew Terhune, a photographer who met Brisman when he took pictures of her for a calendar last year, described her as ""just a really sweet, goofy, energetic kid."" He added that she was enrolled in Alcoholics Anonymous and was contemplating counseling fellow recovering addicts. He had been unaware of her side job as an Internet masseuse. Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blond man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, said the Boston Police Department, which is asking the public's help in identifying the man. Representatives from Craigslist did not respond to a request for comment.","26-year-old died after attack at Boston hotel on Tuesday .
