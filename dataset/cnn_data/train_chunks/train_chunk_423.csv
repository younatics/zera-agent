"(CNN) -- Is this the moment the world finally gets to know what really happened in December 2010 when FIFA decided to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar? Football's world governing body has decided to publish a redacted version of Michael Garcia's report into alleged corruption surrounding the bidding process for the tournaments after months of delay and intense criticism. The decision did not require a vote and was unanimously endorsed by FIFA's 25-person executive committee during its two-day meeting in Marrakech, Morocco. ""I have asked the FIFA ExCo to vote in favor of the publication of the 2018/2022 inquiry report by the investigatory chamber,"" said FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Blatter also insisted that there would not be a re-vote on the decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively. ""The report is about history and I am focused on the future,"" added Blatter while referring to the recommendation made by Domenico Scala, FIFA's head of compliance. ""We will not revisit the 2018 and 2022 vote and a report by independent, external legal experts commissioned by Mr. Scala supports the view that there are no legal grounds to revoke the Executive Committee's decision on the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. ""We are already in the process of incorporating recommendations made by independent experts including the ethics committee for how the FIFA World Cup selection process can be improved so that everyone can be confident that the 2026 bidding process will be fair, ethical and open."" In a press conference which followed his statement, he added: ""It would really need an earthquake, extremely important new elements to go back on this World Cup in Qatar."" FIFA says it will confirm the dates for the World Cup in Qatar at its next executive committee meeting in Switzerland in March. It is expected to be held in the winter with fears over the intense heat in the Gulf State. Meanwhile, the report will not be published until current investigations into five individuals are completed, and it's expected to be heavily redacted. Three members of the committee -- Spain's MarÃ­a Villar Llona, Wowrawi Makudi, of Thailand and Belgium's Michel D'Hooghe -- were being investigated by Garcia for either alleged code breaches during the bidding process or for failing to comply with his probe . Harold Mayne-Nicholls, who led the inspection team visiting the candidates to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments and former German World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer are also facing charges from the FIFA ethics committee which both men have denied. Blatter also confirmed that Garcia has been replaced by his deputy, Cornel BorbÃ©ly, who he describes as ""an outstanding lawyer"". ""It is important that the work of the ethics committee continues and that any instances of wrongdoing are fully investigated and their perpetrators pursued and sanctioned,"" said Blatter. ""I have been informed that various cases against individuals for alleged rule violations have been opened by the investigatory chamber and are currently under review by the adjudicatory chamber. ""The organization fully supports the rigorous pursuit of these cases. And, while FIFA as an organization does not have prosecutorial powers, we have provided information and the full report from Mr. Garcia to the Swiss General Attorney's Office and have pledged our cooperation."" Michel Platini, head of UEFA, the European governing body, also welcomed the decision to publish the report. ""It was important that the FIFA Executive Committee decided today to publish the Garcia report,"" he said on Twitter via his spokesman, Pedro Pinto. ""I have always battled for transparency and this is a step in the right direction. ""Let us hope that the report can now be published as quickly as possible. The credibility of FIFA depends on it."" The move comes just days after Garcia resigned from his role citing a ""lack of leadership"" at the top of world football's governing body. Garcia quit following FIFA's rejection of his appeal after he had launched a complaint about how his report had been summarized by Hans-Joachim Eckert -- FIFA's independent ethics judge. ""I disagree with the Appeal Committee's decision,"" said the American lawyer -- now chairman of the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee -- in a public statement. ""It now appears that, at least for the foreseeable future, the Eckert Decision will stand as the final word on the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process. ""No independent governance committee, investigator, or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organization."" Blatter said he was surprised by Garcia's resignation but that the ""work of the Ethics Committee will nonetheless continue."" ""Pending the election of a new chairman of the Ethics Committee by the FIFA Congress, the FIFA Executive Committee will appoint an acting chairman to serve as a replacement for Mr Garcia,"" added Blatter, who will be at FIFA ExCo's meeting in Marrakech on Thursday and Friday. Garcia's decision to leave his role came following months of frustration for the New York Attorney. In September, when he completed his report, he spoke out and declared that it should be made public but with redactions to ensure witness confidentiality was not compromised. FIFA rejected his request on the grounds that witness confidentiality for his work could prove difficult to sustain if the report was published and threatened to sanction him for his outburst. Then Eckert published his summary, prompting Garcia to respond by saying the German judge's 42-page report contained ""numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations."" FIFA has been under increasing pressure from the media and football fans to publish the report and embrace a period of reform. Sponsors such as Visa and Coca-Cola have both gone public with their grievances over FIFA's lack of transparency, while Sony will not be renewing its deal when it ends at the end of this year. Widespread skepticism over the way Russia and Qatar won the rights to host the next two tournaments remain, despite both countries being cleared of any wrongdoing by Eckert's summary. Both Russia and Qatar have always denied they were involved in any wrongdoing during the bidding process. The outcome of the vote is unlikely to hinder Blatter's chances of retaining the presidency when the elections are held in May. Blatter, who is 78, is poised to win a fifth term in office and faces little opposition with votes from Asia, Africa and South America already assured. UEFA has yet to publicly back a candidate, but it has distanced itself from the bid by Frenchman Jerome Champagne, the only man to have publicly announced his plan to stand against Blatter. Frenchman Platini, the UEFA president, has ruled out running against Blatter but there is now a race against time for his organization to thrown their weight behind a candidate. One option for UEFA would be Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein, the Jordanian Prince, who is also a vice-president of FIFA. Al-Hussein is one of the most forward thinking members of the ExCo and publicly backed the publishing of the report. Yet Al-Hussein could be thwarted by his own confederation by the Asian Football Confederation, which has already pledged its support to Blatter. If Al-Hussein is unable to secure the support of his own confederation it would mean his challenge would be over before it had even begun.","FIFA will publish Michael Garcia's report into world cup .

"Dutch installation artist Florentijn Hofman must be feeling cursed right about now. The man whose giant rubber duck was stabbed 42 times in Belgium, attacked by a suspected eagle in Keelung City, Taiwan, and sunk in Hong Kong has a new disaster to contend with: grilled rabbit. Hofman's giant Moon Rabbit, on exhibit at the Taoyuan Land Arts Festival since September 4, was damaged in a fire on Monday, a day after the 11-day festival concluded. ""The workers have disassembled and set aside the rabbit's ears and head before removing the limbs of the rabbit,"" according to Department of Cultural Affairs, Taoyuan County Government. About five percent of the remaining rabbit is scorched, resulting a charred torso and paws. Cause of fire unknown . The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but is believed to have been ""caused by sparks from chainsaws"" used by workers disassembling the rabbit, according to Focus Taiwan. Made from Tyvek -- a waterproof, paper-like construction material -- Hofman's enormous yet adorable Moon Rabbit spent the festival reclining on a grass-roof bunker, gazing at the moon. The Moon Rabbit was inspired by Chinese folklore associated with the Mid-Autumn Festival, which took place last week. According to legend, the rabbit lives on the moon and is the companion of the moon goddess Chang'er. ""The fortunate thing is that Moon Rabbit was especially designed for the short-term exhibition for Taoyuan Land Arts Festival, and the festival was over yesterday,"" said Hsin-yi Hu, exbihition manager for Blue Dragon Art Company, the Taiwan-based group responsible for bringing the rabbit to the festival. ""As a typhoon is coming, workers had been trying to disassemble the installation as quickly as possible,"" said Hu. ""The fire started on the lawn before spreading to the rabbit."" Hofman, after being notified, said he was relieved to hear no one was injured from the accident and ""blamed"" that on the warmess of Taiwanese people to his work, according to the statement.","Larger-than-life bunny art installation in Taiwan catches fire .

"A Georgia man became the first inmate in the United States to be put to death since the botched execution of an Oklahoma man in April. Marcus A. Wellons, 59, was declared dead at 11:56 p.m. Tuesday at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The newspaper was one of the media witnesses to the execution. Wellons' execution was one of three scheduled in less than 24 hours. John Winfield was put to death by lethal injection at 12:01 a.m. CT Wednesday, a statement from the Missouri Department of Public Safety said.  He was pronounced dead nine minutes later. In Florida, John Ruthell Henry is scheduled to be executed at 6 p.m. Wednesday. Wellons was convicted in 1993 of raping and killing India Roberts, 15, in Cobb County, just outside Atlanta. Earlier, Georgia Department of Corrections spokeswoman Lisa Rodriguez-Presley said the execution drug to be used was pentobarbital, the same as Georgia has used in the past. Georgia uses a single execution drug, while Oklahoma uses a lethal cocktail, she said. Clayton Lockett was put to death in April in Oklahoma. Execution witnesses said Lockett, a convicted murderer and rapist, convulsed and writhed on the execution gurney and struggled to speak before officials blocked the witnesses' view. Lockett died of a heart attack 43 minutes after being administered the first drug, CNN affiliate KFOR-TV in Oklahoma City reported. A team that prepared Lockett for execution in April failed to set a properly functioning I-V in his leg, according to preliminary findings of an independent autopsy released last week.

"MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (CNN) -- Uruguay became the first Latin American country to allow same-sex couples to adopt children after the Senate voted to approve a bill modifying the country's adoption statute. ""It is a right for the boys and the girls, not a right for the adults,"" Sen. Margarita Percovich said after the vote on Wednesday. ""It streamlines the adoption process and does not discriminate."" The expected Senate approval followed the lower chamber of Congress' passage of the bill last month. The law will pave the way for gays and lesbians to start a family, Daniel Alonso, a resident of the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo, told CNN. ""You have plans to form a family, to adopt. When you have a law that protects you, it makes you want to have a child,"" he said. ""You feel part of society."" The adoption measure would be the most recent of progressive laws passed with the backing of President Tabare Vazquez. Last year, lawmakers approved a measure allowing children aged 12 or older to change their names, a measure aimed at transgender or transsexual youths. Uruguay also authorized same-sex civil unions last year, setting the stage for the current adoption law. The measure was not without opponents among conservatives and the clergy. Last month, Archbishop Nicolas Cotugno of Montevideo, released a statement warning of consequences for society should the law pass, the Catholic News Agency reported. ""The adoption of children by homosexual couples is not a question of religion, philosophy or sociology. It has to do with respect for human nature itself,"" he said, according to CNA. ""To accept the adoption of children by homosexual couples is to go against human nature itself, and consequently, it is to go against the fundamental rights of the human being as a person.""

"Ray Rice took the first step toward a possible return to the football field Tuesday evening when the NFL players' union announced it had filed an appeal of his indefinite suspension by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Goodell initially had suspended the running back for two games without pay and fined him the equivalent of another game's pay. Rice was just a few days away from the end of the original suspension when the commissioner decided to increase the penalty to an indefinite suspension once he saw a video of Rice knocking out his now-wife with a punch earlier this year. Two suspensions amount to penalizing Rice twice for the same event, the National Football League Players Association said. The union said, ""Under governing labor law, an employee cannot be punished twice for the same action when all of the relevant facts were available to the employer at the time of the first punishment."" A third party should rule on the appeal, the union said. ""The NFLPA appeal is based on supporting facts that reveal a lack of a fair and impartial process, including the role of the office of the Commissioner of the NFL,"" the union said in a written statement. ""We have asked that a neutral and jointly selected arbitrator hear this case as the Commissioner and his staff will be essential witnesses in the proceeding and thus cannot serve as impartial arbitrators."" The NFL did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Whether the 27-year-old Rice suits up this season -- or ever again -- in an NFL uniform is still a large question. In the past, players appealing a suspension haven't been able to take part in games, so an immediate return is unlikely. And there is the matter of Rice being a man without a team right now. NFL's past penalties for domestic violence 'a different story' The former Baltimore Ravens star had his contract terminated by the team earlier this month in the wake of the disturbing video that shows him knocking out his Janay Rice on an elevator in a casino in Atlantic City on February 15. Rice still can apply for reinstatement next August if he doesn't win the appeal. But to get a chance to try out for a new team, he'll have to convince the commissioner that he's learned from his actions and paid a price. Then he'll have to convince a prospective club that he still has the skills that earned him three Pro Bowl selections. It is unclear how long the appeal process will take, but under the terms of an agreement between NFL owners and players a date for a hearing must be scheduled with 10 days of the appeal. ""Typically, there has to be a fair level of discovery,"" George Atallah, the assistant executive director of external affairs for the players' union, said Monday. ""There has to be a process by which we can both discover and present facts around his indefinite suspension. So there's no set timetable for that."" Atallah said the appeal would be pursued ""methodically."" In August, after outrage over Rice's initial two-game suspension, Goodell announced a new league policy for domestic violence and other assaults. First-time offenders would be suspended at least six games and a second offense would draw a lifetime ban. But he didn't alter Rice's punishment at that time. Ray Rice hasn't spoken publicly since the indefinite suspension, but he texted CNN's Rachel Nichols a message last week: ""I'm just holding strong for my wife and kid, that's all I can do right now."" Can Ray Rice ultimately be forgiven? 'Sickening' video . TMZ Sports obtained two videos from the footage taken from surveillance cameras of the altercation with Janay Rice in Atlantic City. It posted the first one, which showed Rice dragging Janay Rice -- limp and face down -- out of the elevator, shortly after the incident. The in-elevator video showing the violent punch was put online September 8. Goodell told CBS last week that he was sickened by what he saw on the newly released video and that it was the first time he had seen the full scope of the incident. Timeline of key events in the Ray Rice case . He also deflected criticism of his handling of Rice's case and his initial lenient penalty for the domestic violence incident. ""What we saw in the first videotape was troubling to us in and of itself,"" Goodell said last week. ""But what we saw yesterday was extremely clear. It was extremely graphic and it was sickening."" Later, the NFL announced that former FBI Director Robert Mueller would investigate how the league handled its investigation in the case. One thing at the top of his list likely is an Associated Press report that a law enforcement official said he sent a DVD with a copy of the punch video in a package to an unnamed NFL executive in April. A woman called from an NFL office phone to confirm receipt of the package, the AP reported, citing a voice mail played for a reporter. The league has said no one in its office had seen the video before September 8. Goodell explained in a memo to NFL team owners that the league believed it would have been illegal to obtain the video because it was part of a criminal investigation in New Jersey. TMZ executive producer Harvey Levin indicated that the website paid for the video from someone who worked at the now-shuttered casino. Rice was a three-time Pro Bowl selection in eight seasons. He played on the Baltimore Ravens' Super Bowl championship team in 2012 season. NFLPA President Eric Winston said Rice should be allowed to play again . ""I think so. I think that we're all entitled to a second chance,"" said Winston, who played last season with the Arizona Cardinals. ""Obviously he made a horrific mistake and he's paying for it.  He's already disciplined once, and actually disciplined multiple times by the commissioner.""

"The barrage of threats from North Korea has sparked talk from within South Korea of the need to develop its own nuclear weapons. A recent poll shows that two-thirds of South Korean citizens surveyed support the idea, especially in the wake of North Korea's third nuclear test in February. ""We, the Korean people, have been duped by North Korea for the last 20 to 30 years and it is now time for South Koreans to face the reality and do something that we need to do,"" said Chung Mong-joon, a lawmaker in the governing Saenuri (New Frontier) Party and a former presidential conservative candiate. ""The nuclear deterrence can be the only answer. We have to have nuclear capability."" The talk of South Korea arming with its own nuclear weapon used to be taboo in the country-- and there's no apparent official government move to do so.  But the tensions between the two Korean nations have amplified over the weeks, becoming reminiscent of the Cold War. U.S. lawmaker questions North Korean leader's 'stability' Earlier this month, South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok responded to North Korea's threat to attack the South with a pre-emptive nuclear strike saying: ""If North Korea is to attack the South with its nuclear weapons... Kim Jong Un's regime will cease to exist on the face of Earth."" After North Korea conducted its third nuclear test last month, the South unveiled a cruise missile, which it claims to be so precise that it can target ""a specific window of a North Korean military commander's office."" Some commentators in South Korean media have been calling for a nuclear weapons option, claiming that the country has the technology and economy to develop them in a short period of time. And public opinion is following in line. According to a February poll conducted by South Korea's private think tank, Asan Institute, 66% of South Koreans said they support developing a nuclear weapons program. The poll suggests that just under half of South Koreans in 2012 believed that the United States would provide South Korea with what's known as the ""nuclear umbrella"" in the case of a North Korean nuclear attack, indicating a 7% decrease from 2011. Under the nuclear umbrella, the U.S. is to provide South Korea with defensive means to ensure deterrence against a nuclear threat. In recent times, South Korea has been known for little if no reaction on North Korea's provocations and threats. Its attitude changed after the 2010 attack on its battleship That killed more than 40 sailors -- North Korea was blamed. That same year, there was also outrage after the North shelled Yeonpyeong Island. South Korea returned fire and also began responding to North Korea with its own strong words. North Korea: Nuclear program not a bargaining chip . But not all South Koreans are rallying behind the cause of developing South Korean nuclear weapons. If South Korea makes nuclear weapons, nonproliferation in the region would soon fall apart, Han Yong-sup, professor at the Korea National Defense University said.  ""Japan and Taiwan could follow the suit. Then, a domino effect of nuclear proliferation will result,"" he said. To assuage anxieties in South Korea, ""Washington needs to make an official statement in order to make U.S. extended deterrence more credible,"" Han added. Experts say that China, also a powerful economic partner with South Korea, will never agree with the idea of nuclear armed South Korea, because ""it will affect Sino-U.S. ties,"" said Yang Zhaohui, a professor of international relations at Peking University. North Korean video shows imagined attack on Washington . But so far, China hasn't been pleased with Kim's nuclear ambitions, although it is North Korea's closest ally and economic supporter. China recently signed on to tougher U.N. sanctions against the north, targeting that country's nuclear program. ""China appears to be getting impatient on North Korea,"" Yang said. ""The Chinese government does not appear to be controlling its public opinion on North Korea anymore. North Korea is not popular here."" Recently, criticism of North Korea have become rampant on Sina Weibo, the popular Chinese microblog. Kim Jong Un has even earned a nickname ""Jin Sanpang"" which means ""Fat Kim the Third,"" and has become a popular subject of satire among Chinese netizens. An editorial printed in China's state-run newspaper Global Times in January warned North Korea that if it conducted a nuclear test it would not hesitate to reduce assistance to North Korea. ""China's attitude towards North Korea appears to be changing,"" Yan said. ""But China's priority is peace and stability in the region. It wants to maintain good relationship with both South and North Korea.""

"Britain will launch the world's first spaceport outside the U.S., with first space tourists blasting off from the UK as early as 2018. The details were revealed Tuesday at the Farnborough Air Show in Hampshire, England. The UK government outlined eight possible locations of the port -- one in Wales, one in England and six in Scotland, despite the independence referendum which Scotland holds in September. ""Space is big business for the UK. It already contributes $19 billion (£11.3 bn) to the economy each year, supporting nearly 35,000 jobs,"" UK Business Secretary Vince Cable said. Until now, the UK had limited its involvements in space programs, launching rockets from Australia rather than constructing its own facility. The UK government has expressed the ambitious target of capturing 10% of the global space sector, quadrupling the value of the nation's industry to $68 billion a year. ""We have worked out the regulatory regime we need to launch spaceships in Britain and assessed what kind of aviation checks will have to be imposed when we put craft into space,"" said the UK's science minister David Willetts. ""We have now created a shortlist of locations for the first British spaceport."" He added: ""My benchmark is to ensure the UK space sector is growing faster than the Chinese economy"". The news is a reflection of growth and confidence in British space companies. One such group, Reaction Engines, recently announced a revolutionary new design for a pilotless reusable spacecraft, and intends for this to take off and land like planes, offering an indication of the consumer experience as and when plans come to fruition. Alan Bond, director of Reaction Engines and inventor of the new craft, told CNN that the spaceport marked the culmination of long term investment. ""If you look at total activity on space science, Britain could be world number one - even ahead of the Americans. Pro-rata, we have spent as much as anyone else on opening up space exploration, but the big bit missing was the enabling technology to conduct launches ourselves."" ""Now we're seeing the government say 'we want to grow these areas'. We have well-funded programs up to 2017 and beyond, it's a significant long term commitment."" In addition, international leaders in space tourism Virgin Galactic and XCOR would also be expected to make use of the new base, with Richard Branson having expressed interest in a UK site. The growing competition and infrastructure should see the price of a trip to space decline sharply from the current $204,000 quoted by Virgin Galactic, with flights to launch from New Mexico later this year. Prices could fall by as much as 80% ahead of the 2018 launch of the UK spaceport, according to the Space Innovation and Growth Strategy board. The UK's announcement could spark a competitive rush as rivals stake claims for a piece of the new sector. Consumers look set to be the winners as the one-time dream of space travel for all becomes an ever more accessible reality.","Britain is leading the space race with world's first non-American spaceport .

"This should be the day Nigeria steps into the spotlight and basks in the glow of hosting the World Economic Forum in Africa. It is the first time the West African country has hosted the VIP event since the Geneva-based WEF came to the continent nearly a quarter century ago -- but the spotlight has shifted. Focus is now on the Nigeria's list of problems in the North: kidnappings, terrorist attacks and killings. The country has been a terrific economic growth story for the past few years, humming along at around 7%. It is at the heart of what many define as an African Renaissance. After decades of loans from international lenders such as the World Bank, high debt and little development, Africa is coming alive. That is why Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and his highly regarded economic team were eager to bring global CEOs to their turf. But Nigeria does have a couple of obvious economic black-eyes, most notably an inability to close the wealth gap between the North and South, which in turn has given fuel to the Boko Haram movement and, by extension, radical Islam. These groups take issue with what they see as the negative influences of globalization. The WEF is seen as standing at the forefront of a policy discussion and networking linked to more, not less, globalization. The best indicator for the wealth gap is per capita income. Let's start in the financial capital of Lagos and work our way North. In Lagos, it is pegged at just over $2,900, according to a survey by Renaissance Capital. In the political capital of Abuja, where the economic forum is taking place, it rises to $4,000. But if one heads North to Borno -- the birthplace of Boko Haram -- per capita income is just $1,631. There is an overemphasis on farming, very little in the way of an industrial base and the financial situation is even worse in surrounding states. In Borno, alarmingly, 60% of the population lives in extreme poverty, according to the Nigeria Security Tracker. Poverty and violence often go hand-in-hand, and that is the case here. Nearly a third of all violent deaths in the country over the past two years have taken place in this region. One cannot overlook the effort by the terrorist group to ramp up the heat ahead of this high-profile business forum. But at the same time one cannot ignore the lack of progress in fighting off the violence and persistent corruption. This government's track record of unleashing pent-up demand is solid.  After re-basing its economy in early April to take in services growth, Nigeria zoomed ahead of South Africa as the continent's biggest economy. Nigeria and South Africa are both plagued with high unemployment, but the former's GDP now stands at over a half trillion dollars while the latter's is at $325 billion. South Africa also struggles with less than a third of Nigeria's growth. South Africa's President Jacob Zuma goes to the polls making the case that his country can serve as a springboard into the faster growing economies of West and East Africa, due to its lead in financial and trade services. Nigerian private sector banks and telecom providers have a different view. Nigeria has all the ingredients for growth: 170 million people, a low debt level and low budget deficit with the blessing of sizable proven oil reserves.  At 37 billion barrels, the country is ranked second on the continent behind Libya. It is a nice recipe for growth, but the rule of law and rooting out corruption rank high on the foreign investor check list. That is where Nigeria remains vulnerable.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House Wednesday said it was ""puzzled"" by a former spokesman's memoir in which he accuses the Bush administration of being mired in propaganda and political spin and at times playing loose with the truth. Former White House spokesman Scott McClellan blasts President Bush and advisers in a new book. In excerpts from a 341-page book to be released Monday, Scott McClellan writes on the war in Iraq that Bush ""and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war."" ""[I]n this regard, he was terribly ill-served by his top advisers, especially those involved directly in national security,"" McClellan wrote. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino called McClellan's description of his time at the White House ""sad.""  Read excerpts from the book » . ""Scott, we now know, is disgruntled about his experience at the White House,"" Perino said. ""For those of us who fully supported him, before, during and after he was press secretary, we are puzzled. It is sad. This is not the Scott we knew."" McClellan's former White House colleagues had harsher reactions to McClellan's book. Frances Townsend, former Homeland Security adviser to Bush, said advisers to the president should speak up when they have policy concerns. ""Scott never did that on any of these issues as best I can remember or as best as I know from any of my White House colleagues,"" said Townsend, now a CNN contributor. ""For him to do this now strikes me as self-serving, disingenuous and unprofessional."" Fox News contributor and former White House adviser Karl Rove said on that network Tuesday that the excerpts from the book he's read sound more like they were written by a ""left-wing blogger"" than his former colleague. Rove declined to comment to CNN after the Fox News interview. In a brief phone conversation with CNN Tuesday evening, McClellan made clear that he stands behind the accuracy of his book. McClellan said he cannot give on-the-record quotes yet because of an agreement with his publisher.  Watch further details emerge from McClellan's book » . Another former Bush aide-turned-critic says the reaction to McClellan's book by his former colleagues has a familiar ring to it. ""They're saying some of the exact same things about McClellan they said about me,"" Richard Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism chief, told CNN. Clarke left government in 2003. The following year, he accused President Bush of ignoring warnings about the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and of using the attacks to push for war with Iraq. But Clarke gave McClellan little credit for speaking out now. ""I think the difference with McClellan's book is he's now telling us something we all know -- that the war with Iraq was a disastrous war [and] was sold with deception. It's a little different when you say something as I did and a few other people did four or five years ago, when the war was popular and when we were unpopular for saying what we said."" Besides his criticism of how the administration handled the run-up to the Iraq war, McClellan also sharply criticizes the administration on its handling of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath in the book. ""One of the worst disasters in our nation's history became one of the biggest disasters in Bush's presidency,"" he wrote. ""Katrina and the botched federal response to it would largely come to define Bush's second term."" Early in the book, which CNN obtained late Tuesday, McClellan wrote that he believes he told untruths on Bush's behalf in the case of CIA agent Valerie Plame, whose identity was leaked to the media. Rove and fellow White House advisers Elliot Abrams and I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby were accused of leaking the name of Plame -- whose husband, former U.S. ambassador Joseph Wilson, had gone public with charges the Bush administration had ""twisted"" facts to justify the war in Iraq. Libby was convicted last year of lying to a grand jury and federal agents investigating the leak. Bush commuted his 30-month prison term, calling it excessive. At the time, McClellan called the three ""good individuals"" and said he spoke to them before telling reporters they were not involved. ""I had allowed myself to be deceived into unknowingly passing along a falsehood,"" he wrote. ""It would ultimately prove fatal to my ability to serve the president effectively."" McClellan wrote he didn't realize what he said was untrue until reporters began digging up details of the case almost two years later. A former spokesman for Bush when he was governor of Texas, McClellan was named White House press secretary in 2003, replacing Ari Fleischer. McClellan had previously been a deputy press secretary and was the traveling spokesman for the Bush campaign during the 2000 election. He announced he was resigning in April 2006 at a news conference with Bush. ""One of these days, he and I are going to be rocking in chairs in Texas talking about the good old days of his time as the press secretary,"" Bush said at that conference. ""And I can assure you, I will feel the same way then that I feel now, that I can say to Scott, job well done.""

"Transocean Deepwater Inc. will pay $1 billion in civil penalties for the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, after a federal judge in New Orleans signed off Tuesday on the company's deal with the Justice Department. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier is a formality: the Justice Department and Transocean reached the deal last month. Under the agreement, Transocean will have two years to pay out the $1 billion in fines for violations of the Clean Water Act. According to the Justice Department, the agreement also requires Transocean to take steps to improve performance and avoid a repeat of the disaster, which began after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded nearly a mile above BP's sea-floor Macanado well, killing 11 workers on board. The blast and ensuing fire damaged the rig and caused 4.9 million barrels of oil to leak out into the Gulf, according to a 2011 report by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. In addition to the civil penalties, Transocean Deepwater pleaded guilty last week to a criminal violation of the Clean Water Act. U.S. District Judge Jane Triche Milazzo ordered the company to pay a $400 million fine, the second-largest such penalty in U.S. history. The largest was the $4 billion fine imposed on BP in November after the company agreed to plead guilty to felony manslaughter, environmental crimes and obstruction of Congress related to its role in the Deepwater Horizon spill. BP contracted Transocean to do the drilling and had BP officials on the rig. At the time, prosecutors said BP had a ""culture of privileging profit over prudence."" Much of the $400 million Transocean fine will be used to restore and rebuild the Gulf coast region, officials have said. A separate civil trial over the spill is set to begin Monday. That suit, filed by a large group of states, individuals, businesses and the federal government, seeks compensation from BP, Transocean, Halliburton and other companies involved in the disaster for damages incurred from the spill. The trial seeks to determine the cause of the incident and how much each company should pay. Barbier will also preside over that trial. In a statement issued Tuesday, BP said the demands made by plaintiffs are ""excessive and not based on reality."" The company will ""vigorously defend against gross negligence allegations,"" BP general counsel Rupert Bondy said. ""This was a tragic accident, resulting from multiple causes and involving multiple parties,"" he said. ""We firmly believe we were not grossly negligent."" Transocean spokesman Lou Colasuonno said Tuesday that company is also ready for trial. ""The facts of the case are on Transocean's side and our legal team is fully prepared to start proving that New Orleans next week,""  he said.","Judge accepts agreement between Transocean and prosecutors on oil spill fines .

"(CNN) -- Authorities launched a massive sweep of the Alemao favela complex in northern Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Sunday morning. Military police told reporters they were entering the virtually impenetrable labyrinth of slums, searching for drug gang leaders and illegal drugs. CNN affiliate TV Record showed images of armored vehicles entering the slum Sunday morning, followed closely by police trucks and helicopters equipped with military rifles. Police told TV Record that they had arrested at least nine people, confiscated heavy weapons and seized four tons of marijuana. On Saturday, police spokesman Mario Sergio Duarte declared an ultimatum against drug gangs in the complex, stating that a military attack was imminent. ""We will not retreat in our decision to bring peace to Rio,"" Duarte said. ""We are in our final stages of reaching the traffickers in the Alemao complex."" Police had offered drug gang leaders the chance to surrender, but they refused, Brazilian military police Col. Lima Castro said in an interview with CNN affiliate Band News Sunday. Castro said police were asking any residents who live in the slum to stay home and take cover to avoid being hit by any stray bullets during the takeover. A police officer was hit in the arm by a bullet as authorities entered, police told TV Record. The Red Cross sent 50 volunteers to help with the injured and there are four vehicles throughout the complex capable of helping with basic nursing and first-aid needs, the agency told Band News. Police said that some criminals were threatening taxi drivers to get them out of the slums, and some neighboring favelas said that the drug traffickers simply migrated to their neighborhoods, both television stations reported. There were also reports of suspects trying to escape through sewer lines running underneath the slum. Some 2,600 police and soldiers occupied the favela Sunday, and Castro said that there is no target time to leave. Army Gen. Adriano Pereira Jr. said they will hold their positions as needed. ""We are serving a request by the department of defense with authorization by President Lula. We will stay for as long as its necessary,"" he said. At least 35 people have died, 174 arrested and 123 detained since violence broke out last Sunday as a response by drug gangs to an increased police presence in the crime-ridden slums, known as favelas, police said, according to the official Agencia Brasil. More than 96 vehicles have been burned. Brazil's Defense Minister Nelson Jobim has said that in addition to the 800 federal troops, other reinforcements in support of local police were being directed to Rio amid fears that the crisis could spill over to neighboring states.","NEW: 2,600 police and soldiers occupy Alemao favela complex, police say .

"BP is accusing Halliburton of having ""intentionally destroyed evidence"" related to the explosion aboard an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico that led to the worst oil spill in U.S. history. The accusation comes in court papers filed by BP Monday in federal court in New Orleans as part of a lawsuit aimed at having sanctions imposed on Halliburton Energy Services Inc., which was a contractor for BP on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. An explosion on the rig on April 20, 2010, killed 11 people working on the rig and injured 16 others. The explosion led to more than 200 million gallons of oil being released into the Gulf. BP alleges in its filing that Halliburton destroyed evidence on cement testing and violated court orders by not bringing forth ""inexplicably missing"" computer modeling results. ""Halliburton has steadfastly refused to provide these critical testing and modeling results in discovery. Halliburton's refusal has been unwavering, despite repeated BP discovery requests and a specific order from this Court,"" the documents state. ""BP has now learned the reason for Halliburton's intransigence -- Halliburton destroyed the results of physical slurry testing, and it has, at best, lost the computer modeling outputs that showed no channeling.  More egregious still, Halliburton intentionally destroyed the evidence related to its nonprivileged cement testing, in part because it wanted to eliminate any risk that this evidence would be used against it at trial,"" the BP papers say. When reached for comment Monday, Halliburton spokeswoman Beverly Stafford said the company was reviewing the details of the motion. ""However, we believe that the conclusions that BP is asking the court to draw is without merit and we look forward to contesting their motion in court."" The BP documents state that two Halliburton employees testified under oath about destroying notes and samples related to analyzing the stability of a similar cement mixture that was used in the failed oil well. ""[D]id you take down any notes about the slurry?"" Halliburton Global Advisor in Gulf Cementing Rickey Morgan was asked during a deposition detailed in the court motion. ""No, ma'am,"" Morgan responded. ""You didn't take any pictures?"" ""No, ma'am."" ""And then you said you dumped out the sample?"" ""Yes, ma'am."" ""And you mentioned that the reason that you didn't document the test and you threw out the sample was because you were worried about it being misinterpreted in the litigation?"" ""Yes, that's part of the reason, yes, ma'am,"" Morgan testified, according to the BP papers. BP is seeking to have a ""third-party specialist"" examine a Halliburton computer, saying ""such an examination might well recover the missing modeling results, or shed light on the circumstances of their apparent disappearance."" BP and its two contractors -- Halliburton and Transocean, which owned the Deepwater Horizon rig where the explosion occurred -- have been locked in legal battles since last year. In September, the final federal report on the spill said BP, Transocean and Halliburton all share responsibility for the deadly explosion and ensuing oil spill. The three companies ""violated a number of federal offshore safety regulations,"" according to the report, which was issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. The report concluded that a key cause of the explosion was a faulty cement drilling barrier at the well site. ""The precise reasons for the failure of the production casing cement job are not known,"" the report stated. But the disaster was ""the result of poor risk management, last minute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response, and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling"" at the site. BP was ""ultimately responsible"" for operations at the site ""in a way that ensured the safety and protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the environment,"" the report concluded. But Transocean, as owner of the rig, also was ""responsible for conducting safe operations and for protecting personnel onboard."" Meanwhile, Halliburton -- as a BP contractor -- was ""responsible for conducting the cement job, and ... had certain responsibilities for monitoring the well,"" the report said. A spokesman for BP said in September that the company agreed with report's conclusion. ""The Deepwater Horizon accident was the result of multiple causes, involving multiple parties, including Transocean and Halliburton,"" Scott Dean said. ""BP (has) acknowledged its role in the accident and has taken concrete steps to further enhance safety. ... We continue to encourage other parties to acknowledge their roles in the accident and make changes to help prevent similar accidents in the future."" But in response to the report, Halliburton continued to deny any responsibility for the tragedy. The report ""incorrectly attributes the operation decisions to Halliburton,"" said Zelma Branch, a Halliburton spokeswoman. ""Every contributing cause where Halliburton is named, the operational responsibility lies solely with BP. Halliburton remains confident that all the work we performed with respect to the ... well was completed in accordance with BP's specifications for its well construction plan and instructions."" Besides the oil, hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemical dispersant went into the water. At the peak of the crisis, in June 2010, 37% of Gulf waters -- a total of 88,522 square miles -- were closed to fishing due to contamination.","Halliburton was a contractor for BP at the ill-fated Deepwater Horizon oil drilling operation .

"Gov.  Andrew Cuomo beefed up New York's gun-control laws on Tuesday by signing into law a new package of firearm and mental health regulations that mark the nation's first since last month's massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. Cuomo, a self-described gun owner, said the December 14 tragedy spurred lawmakers to action and called it a ""common sense"" measure before enacting what are widely seen as America's toughest gun laws. ""You can overpower the extremists with intelligence and common sense,"" he said before inking the deal in Albany. The laws fortify New York's existing assault weapons ban, limit the number of bullets allowed in magazines and strengthen rules that govern the mentally ill, which includes a requirement to report potentially harmful behavior. Oregon sheriff: 'Unconstitutional' gun control laws won't be enforced . Both the GOP-controlled Senate and Democrat-dominated Assembly approved the measure by overwhelming margins just one week after Cuomo spelled out the proposals in his annual State of the State address. The first-term Democratic governor had called for a tightening of the assault weapons ban, background checks for people who purchase guns privately and more restrictions on high-capacity magazines. But the new measures drew ire from the nation's largest gun lobby over the speed with which the bill was passed in the new legislative session. The National Rifle Association accused Cuomo and other state lawmakers of orchestrating ""a secretive end-run around the legislative and democratic process."" After two days of voting in the state Legislature, Cuomo signed the deal around 5 p.m. before telling reporters that speed had been essential so as not to create a rush on the gun market. ""There has been all sorts of reports that even the contemplation of this law caused an increase in (gun) sales,"" he said. ""That would have been the exact opposite of what we were trying to achieve."" Related: Details of Obama's proposals . The new laws include a statewide gun registry and a uniform licensing standard, altering the current system in which each county or municipality sets its own standard. Residents are now restricted to purchasing ammunition magazines that carry seven bullets, rather than 10. Related: NRA's shooting video prompts outrage . It remains unclear what effect the measures will have on New York's already stringent approach to gun control. ""The changes in New York are largely cosmetic,"" said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, who described existing regulations as ""the toughest gun laws in the United States."" ""The one change that arguably will have the greatest impact is the amendment to Kendra's Law, which will permit closer monitoring of the mentally ill."" That 1999 law grants New York judges the authority to require residents to undergo psychiatric treatment if they meet certain criteria. Related: Gun control support rises but divide remains over what to do . The new measures will extend Kendra's Law through 2017, expand outpatient treatment from six months to a year and require reviews before such treatment is allowed to expire. New York's mental health professionals will be governed by a new and controversial set of rules that require them to report their patients to the state should those patients exhibit behavior suggesting that they could be harmful to themselves or others. ""We're opening up an unprecedented window into what goes on in the therapy room,"" said Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum, director of the Division of Law, Ethics, and Psychiatry at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. ""It would effect a major change in the usual presumptions of confidentiality."" The bill creates mandatory life sentences for anyone who murders certain first responders, a provision that comes after two firefighters were killed in an ambush as they battled a blaze in upstate New York. The vote coincides with a series of recommendations put together by Vice President Joe Biden meant to address the nation's gun violence. Lawmakers in at least 10 other states are reviewing some form of new gun regulations in the new year.","NRA decries speed of bill .

"Don Hartsell knows his idea could be considered crazy. ""I thought this project was so large, so ambitious, that no one would take me seriously,"" says the Texas resident and aircraft enthusiast. ""In fact, I was concerned they would think I was insane."" Hartsell is talking about his World Sky Race, which as conceived would be a grand global spectacle. If all goes according to plan, a fleet of airships will take off from London in 2014 and race each other around the world, watched by millions of spectators, before finishing six months later just outside of Paris. The event is planned as a series of 18 back-to-back races that will circumnavigate the globe. Although the route isn't finalized, the proposed path will take pilots over at least four continents and about 130 United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage sites -- among them the Egyptian pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty and the Palace of Versailles. Hartsell, founder of a group of blimp enthusiasts known as the World Air League, expects celebrations in each of the cities where the airships touch down, with wide-eyed children gathering to see the blimps float overhead. He estimates 140 million people around the world will witness the race -- a number that dwarfs the 5 million or so spectators for the London Olympic Games. The first-place prize for the speediest airship? Hartsell promises at least $5 million and the title of World Sky Champion. He plans to officially announce the race at Versailles this fall, giving interested competitors almost two years to prepare. A far-fetched dream? As you can imagine, there are still a lot of ""ifs"" surrounding the World Sky Race. Skeptics might rightly wonder if it will ever happen. Start dates have been thrown around for years -- September 2011 was one that was widely reported -- and yet Hartsell's race has yet to get off the ground. Hartsell says he is still securing sponsors and raising prize money, as well as negotiating with princes and politicians for permission to fly airships over their landmarks. The market crash of 2008 caused delays and led potential sponsors to walk away, he says. Hartsell estimates there are 30 to 35 airships in the world, and he hopes to rally at least five of them to participate in the race. Each blimp will represent a nation, region or city, which he believes will encourage fan and sponsor support. He expects the race to cost about $50 million, to be financed by donations and sponsorships. ""It's being funded purely by that good old mechanism we call capitalism,"" he said. For each of the 18 legs of the race, the blimps will have to follow a set flight path. They will fly about 2,000 feet above sea level, making them visible to people on the ground. The airships expect to average about 70 miles per hour, which would allow them to travel about 1,000 miles a day, Hartsell says. Competitors will be timed from the moment they depart to the moment they arrive at an official endpoint. The blimp with the shortest cumulative time will be crowned the victor. From the Hindenburg to Goodyear . Mention of airships brings to mind the 1937 Hindenburg disaster, in which a German passenger airship went up in flames while attempting to dock in New Jersey, killing 36 people. The Hindenburg was a rigid blimp, with an aluminum frame containing hydrogen-filled bags that lifted it into the air. Many airships today are non-rigid vessels that have no frame and are instead filled with helium -- which, unlike hydrogen, is not flammable. Tim Crouch, senior curator of aeronautics at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, said airships had their heyday during the first 40 years of the 20th century because they were more capable than airplanes of carrying heavy loads over long distances. But as airplanes grew larger and faster, blimps were used less often to ferry cargo. The military used blimps for surveillance and reconnaissance until the 1960s, said Crouch, noting that the U.S. Navy has been experimenting with a blimp again in recent years. In recent decades airships such as the Goodyear or DirecTV blimps have been used for commercial purposes, usually at parades and sporting events. Crouch said using airships as advertising is an age-old tradition he can see investors buying into, especially in a race around the world. ""Those kinds of aeronautical challenges always pique people's interests,"" he said. ""I mean, I'd watch that -- wouldn't you?"" UNESCO's role . The idea for the World Sky Race first came to Hartsell when he was 23 years old and in New York City for the U.S. bicentennial celebration of 1976. As he watched the Goodyear blimp hover over tall-masted sailing ships in the harbor, he envisioned creating an airship race that would unite and inspire people like the bicentennial did. But it wasn't until 30 years later, after he worked as a accountant, an attorney and an entrepreneur, that Hartsell decided it was finally time to make the World Sky Race a reality. ""I started this out with, 'OK, you're at a point in your life where either you can retire or you can do something worthwhile.' I went, 'Are you still crazy?' Then the next question I asked myself was, 'How's your health?' Because to put this together has turned into a large undertaking. Then the third question: 'If not now?' And so with that, it started."" Hartsell has found backing for his venture from such heavyweights as the former CEO of Lockheed Martin, a member of Jordan's royal family and officials at UNESCO. Francesco Bandarin, UNESCO's assistant director general for culture, said the race would allow the U.N. to highlight its World Heritage sites, which range from natural wonders such as the Grand Canyon to man-made landmarks like the Sydney Opera House. ""This offers a great opportunity to publicize the sites, and ... the need to rally international support for their conservation,"" Bandarin said. ""This race would be a world premiere -- something never tried."" 'He thinks big' As Hartsell sees it, his event isn't just about racing blimps. He has enlisted the help of Scott McNealy, former chairman of tech giant Sun Microsystems, to use the World Sky Race as a teaching tool for children around the world. Since his days in Silicon Valley, McNealy has helped create Cirriki, a nonprofit that allows educators to share K-12 curricula on its website. McNealy hopes to use Cirriki.org to help teachers and students track the race and to give them lesson plans about geology, ecology, history and culture related to the airships' travel around the world. ""Anything that gets students out of the rut of the physical textbook I think is a good thing,"" McNealy said. ""I never would have come up with a blimp race as a way to do that, but you can see that it would be very fascinating to young kids."" Hartsell also hopes the race will spur the development of new airship technology. He sees these vessels, which require less fuel and infrastructure than many other means of transportation, as the future of aviation. ""It makes so much sense for the environment, and it also makes so much sense for not having to build the roads and not having to dredge the harbors,"" he said. Even as a member of the World Sky Race's advisory council, McNealy confesses he doesn't know exactly when, or even if, the race will happen. But he hopes Hartsell's dream for this one-of-a-kind event comes to fruition someday. ""You've got to give him credit,"" McNealy said. ""He thinks big.""","Texas aircraft enthusiast is planning a blimp race that would circle the globe .

"Thousands of Palestinians celebrated the release Sunday night of 550 inmates from Israeli prisons, part of the second phase of the deal that won the freedom of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. The revelry in the Mukataa compound in Ramallah -- the long-timehome to the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat -- ran late into the night. Tayeb Abdel Rahim, general-secretary in Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' office, was among those officials greeting the line of freed prisoners, as they all paid their respects at Arafat's grave. Hamas' armed wing, the Izzedine al Qassam Brigades, welcomed the news even as they, like Rahim and other Palestinian leaders, continued to push for the release of others in Israeli custody. ""It's a great accomplishment, but it's not the end,"" brigade spokesman Abu Obieda said Sunday night. ""We will work toward liberating all our prisoners."" The Israel Defense Forces said in a news release Sunday night that the International Red Cross assisted in the release process, which it noted at 10:30 p.m. had been ""completed."" It all follows a deal, signed between Israel and Hamas in October, that won Shalit's release from Hamas in exchange for allowing more than 1,000 Palestinians to leave Israeli jails. A total of 477 prisoners were freed in October under the first stage of the swap. Phase two happened late Sunday night with the departure of ten buses from Ofer Prison, said Sivan Weizmann of the Israeli Prisoners Authority. The majority of the prisoners to be released Sunday -- 505, including four women -- were sent to the West Bank through the Beitunia crossing.  Forty-one others were transferred into Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing.  Two prisoners were sent to Jordan via the Allenby crossing and two others -- a man and a woman -- were sent to their homes in east Jerusalem via the Atarot base. Rahim, the senior official in Abbas' office, thanked Egyptian officials for their role in the prisoner swap. He also said that Palestinian leaders are still seeking the release of others ""including the old, children and the ill ones and also the members of the Palestinian legislative council."" ""We insist that going back to the negotiation table will not happen without the immediate halt of all settlement activities ... and the recognition of the state borders, including Jerusalem, and the release of all prisoners as agreed to with the previous Israeli government,"" Rahim said. Ahead of the expected release, Israeli security forces and hundreds of Palestinians clashed at a West Bank crossing near the internment facility where the prisoners were being held. At least 20 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were injured in the Sunday evening skirmishes at the Beitunia crossing, according to Palestinian and Israeli officials. Samer Abu Ali, spokesman for the Palestinian medical relief services in Ramallah, told CNN that many of the Palestinians suffered injuries from inhaling tear gas and from rubber bullets fired by the Israeli security forces at the families and friends of the soon-to-be-released prisoners. Palestinian independent lawmaker and political activist Mustafa Barghouti, who was at the scene of the clashes, told CNN that he had been sprayed with foul-smelling water used to disperse crowds and had been overcome by tear gas. An Israeli military spokesman said some 400 Palestinians were engaged in an ""illegal riot"" at the crossing point and were throwing rocks and burning tires. The spokesman said soldiers were using riot control methods to disperse the crowds. Shalit was captured in June 2006, and spent more than five years in captivity. While the first stage of the deal to release him provoked significant discontent among some Israelis, with the families of terror victims claiming the price paid for one single soldier was too costly, Sunday's release prompted very little attention in Israeli media. ""The first group of prisoners released in October is immeasurably different from the one to be released today,"" Amy Palmor, head of the paroles department at the Israeli Justice Ministry, told CNN. ""All 550 freed today were not directly involved in the injuring or killing of Israeli citizens and most of them are members of Fatah,"" Palmor said. Fatah, the ruling Palestinian party, is considered in Israel as the most moderate of all Palestinian political fractions. ""The list in the first part of the deal was largely dictated by Hamas and was composed mainly of prisoners with blood on their hands serving life imprisonments. Most of them were members of Hamas and other extremist organizations,"" she added. Many of the inmates who were released Sunday would have finished serving their sentences before the end of 2012, Palmor said. But some criticized the terms of the swap agreement. ""This deal is a formality that doesn't meet our expectations. The second stage of this deal didn't include old, ill or handicapped prisoners. It also didn't include the remaining five female prisoners inside Israeli jails. This deal was solely controlled by the Israeli side,"" Issa Qaraqe, the Palestinian Authority minister of Detainees and Ex-detainees Affairs, told CNN. ""We will welcome and celebrate the prisoners in the Mukataa upon their release. The fact that the release will take place during the night will not affect our celebrations. Israel decided to release them at night with the wrong assumption that this will affect the intensity of the celebrations. The celebrations will start tonight and will continue for several days in different districts and towns, each prisoner will be celebrated in his own hometown,"" Qaraqe said. The minister said Israel had launched a large arrest campaign after the initial prisoner release in October. ""As long as the occupation continues, arrests will continue,"" he said, adding that approximately 3,500 Palestinian prisoners remain behind bars in Israeli prisons.","The release of 550 Palestinian prisoners has been ""completed,"" Israel's military says .

"A top congressional Republican is drafting alternative gun control legislation that threatens to undermine proposals now under consideration by leaders of the Senate's Democratic majority. A spokeswoman for Iowa's Chuck Grassley refused to give CNN details of the senator's plan.  In the past, however, he has backed measures to deter ""straw purchases"" to clamp down on gun trafficking.  He also supports new safety provisions for schools. Grassley is a staunch opponent of a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines.  He has also expressed skepticism about new background checks -- an idea at the heart of the current congressional debate. ""Sen. Grassley is putting together a bill to reduce gun violence without violating the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens,"" spokeswoman Beth Levine told CNN.  ""The bill is still being written, so we're not able to share it at this time."" The plan being put together by Grassley -- first reported by Politico -- further complicates the politics of gun control in Congress, where the National Rifle Association is extremely powerful. Obama: 'Shame on us' if Newtown doesn't bring new gun laws . President Barack Obama pushed new gun control legislation near the top of the legislative priority list in the wake of December's school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 first-graders were killed.  But Democrats are struggling to find the 60 votes needed to push any new measures through the 100-member Senate. Alternative legislation from Grassley could provide cover for moderate Democrats from more conservative states looking to back some sort of bill not vehemently opposed by the NRA or other political heavyweights.  It could also help firm up GOP opposition to more expansive legislation including background checks. Addressing gun control supporters at a White House event on Thursday, Obama accused gun rights activists of playing a crass game of political obstruction. ""There are some powerful voices on the other side who are interested in running out the clock, or changing the subject,"" the president said.  ""Their assumption is that people will just forget about it"" as Newtown recedes further into the past. If that happens, said Obama, then ""shame on us."" Opinion: Did we learn nothing from Newtown? The list of proposals backed by the president in the aftermath of Newtown includes expanded background checks, tougher laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases, and improving safety at schools.  Obama also supports a renewal of the assault weapons ban, though that provision has been virtually abandoned by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. The president on Thursday rejected arguments by opponents of the legislation that the measures under consideration by Democrats -- including background checks -- would strip Americans of their constitutional right to bear arms. ""What we're proposing is not radical. It's not taking away anyone's gun rights,"" Obama said.  Congress shouldn't get ""squishy because time has passed and maybe (the issue's) not on the news every day."" But much of what Obama considers ""squishy"" is seen by senators like Grassley as a principled defense of basic freedoms. ""Throughout history, governments have wanted to shut up those who would criticize government, to suppress unpopular religions, or to disarm people,"" Grassley declared at a January 30 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. ""The Constitution for 225 years has established a government that is the servant of the people, not the master,"" he said.  As ""we consider and debate legislation arising (Newtown and other) tragedies, I hope that we will proceed with proper understanding of the relationship that the Constitution establishes between government power and individual liberty."" Polls suggest Congress might have waited too long on gun control .","Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley is putting together a new gun control bill .

"(CNN) -- Reginald DesRoches is deploying to Haiti to tag key infrastructure buildings with red, yellow and green markers -- designations on whether they're still usable. DesRoches has years of experience as a civil engineering expert dealing with structures in the wake of earthquakes. This disaster is also personal: He was born in Haiti and one of his uncles died in the quake's aftermath. The associate chair of Georgia Tech's School of Civil Engineering,  DesRoches will lead a team of experts in Haiti about the sustainability of buildings. He spoke with CNN before heading to Port-au-Prince. Below is a transcript of the interview, a portion of which has been edited. CNN: What will be your task in Haiti? DesRoches: There's an urgent need for a group of experts in earthquake engineering, preferably French speaking, to come down and assess the critical buildings to determine whether or not they're safe to reoccupy. Essentially, we go about tagging them: red for unsafe; green for safe; yellow for something in between. We were asked to do this on a number of critical infrastructure buildings, including hospitals, schools, U.N. facilities, government buildings, as well as buildings occupied by various nations' ambassadors. Evidently, there hasn't been anybody on the ground yet to do that service, so there's a need to get somebody in there ASAP to assess as many buildings as possible. ... There's a specific manual that's been developed by the Applied Technology Council and the manual is geared toward the rapid assessment of buildings after earthquakes. The manual gives you guidelines based on the type of damage -- the type of cracking you have in columns and other load-bearing elements, as well as how many of them have specific levels of damage. Based on this checklist, you can then determine what category your building should be classified as. CNN: In many ways, this is the nightmare scenario. You have this quake in impoverished Haiti. Supplies are hard to get down there. In a month or two, you have the start of a rain season and following that you enter hurricane season. DesRoches: There are a number of issues there. They clearly don't have the infrastructure to facilitate rapid recovery from this. There are a number of buildings that have collapsed and bodies are still there. It will take weeks, if not months, to recover those bodies. And like you said, the rain season is coming up. ... It's really the worst of all cases. This is probably the one country that could not handle an event like this. I call this in some ways the perfect storm of an earthquake, given that it was large, it was very shallow, the infrastructure is extremely poor and the government wasn't prepared. So I think the resulting disaster is really a combination of a number of factors working against it. CNN: Describe your own personal feelings as you head down there, as Haitian and as somebody who lost a loved one. DesRoches: I had one uncle that passed away. His was what we typically call ""secondary effect."" He was found safe following the earthquake. He had been somewhat ill with prostate cancer and he had [gone] back several times to the U.S. for treatment. ... My father spoke to him shortly after the event and he was doing fine on Wednesday. Then, it sounds like he wasn't feeling very well. On Friday, I believe, he went to the hospital and clearly with all the other critical patients, they couldn't really deal with him. And he died on Saturday. A lot of these things are never captured during an event like an earthquake or hurricane. We call them ""secondary effect,"" where a hospital is overrun and those that are ill -- maybe not directly from the earthquake -- end up dying whereas normally they probably would not. CNN: When you first talked to him, you must have been relieved that he was alive and you must have been celebrating. DesRoches:  Absolutely. Another close relative, my godmother and godfather: We've been told through their children in the U.S. that they are safe but their home has been destroyed. CNN: What's going through your mind as you return home? DesRoches: I was born in Haiti. I came [to the U.S.] as a very young child. I was 1½. I spent the majority of my life in the U.S. ... But we still have a lot of family and ties to Haiti. For many years, as my capacity as a civil engineering professor, I've always wanted to do whatever I can to help Haiti. And I see this as one opportunity to do that, given that I do earthquake engineering. I want to use this opportunity, not only to help them recover in the short term, but also rebuild Haiti so that it's safe and sustainable. And I think this earthquake , unfortunately, provides the opportunity to start from scratch and make it a much better, more resilient place.","Civil engineering quake expert heads to Haiti to assess buildings .

"A Texas teen who's been jailed more than four months for a Facebook comment he made during a video-game argument is finally getting a day in court that could let him go home. Justin Carter, who was 18 when he was arrested, will appear in Comal County (Texas) District Court on Tuesday, July 16, for a bond hearing, according to his lawyer, Don Flanary. Flanary told CNN he will argue to have Carter's $500,000 bond, which his family cannot afford to cover, reduced. Flanary, who is working the case for free, met with Carter for the first time on Tuesday. He said Carter is not doing well, and his family says he has been placed on suicide watch. ""Justin is in bad shape and has suffered quite a bit of abuse while in jail,"" Flanary said in an e-mail. ""We will likely bring out these issues at the bond hearing."" He did not elaborate on the type of abuse claimed by Carter, who is now 19. In February, Carter and a friend were arguing on Facebook with someone else over the online video game ""League of Legends."" His father told CNN that the other gamer called Justin crazy and his son responded with sarcasm. According to court documents, Justin wrote, ""I'm f***ed in the head alright. I think I'ma (sic) shoot up a kindergarten and watch the blood of the innocent rain down and eat the beating heart of one of them."" Jack Carter said his son followed the claim with ""LOL"" and ""J/K"" -- indicating that the comment wasn't serious. Authorities say someone reported the comment -- which came about two months after the killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut -- and Justin Carter was arrested February 21 on a charge of making terroristic threats. In Texas, that's a felony that carries a sentence of up to eight years in prison. Police originally thought Carter lived with his father in Austin, Texas, at a home the arrest report says is 100 yards from a school. They later learned he was living in New Braunfels, between Austin and San Antonio. The Austin Police Department declined to provide CNN with additional documents related to the case. The Comal County District Attorney's office, which is prosecuting the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Carter's case has stirred support online. A Change.org petition by his mother, calling for his release, had received more than 43,000 digital signatures as of Wednesday morning. ""Justin's a good kid,"" Jennifer Carter wrote on the petition. ""He wouldn't hurt anyone, let alone a child."" She wrote that he has been ""assaulted a number of  times"" in jail and that no weapons were found during a search of his home. The American Civil Liberties Union tells CNN it is monitoring the case. ""We are all concerned about safety in our schools, but that's not what is at issue here,"" said Rebecca L. Robertson, legal and policy director for the ACLU of Texas. ""The First Amendment protects a person's speech -- even speech that is in poor taste -- as long as it is not a true threat. ""Justin's online comment might have been distasteful and thoughtless. But, if the facts as reported are true, his comment is an objectionable joke rather than an actual threat, in which case the Comal County District Attorney is prosecuting protected speech. That's a dangerous precedent.""","Jailed teen to get hearing that could reduce his bond .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Ninety to 100 Kurdish rebel fighters have been killed during Turkey's incursion on northern Iraq, the Turkish military said Tuesday. The military carried out more than 130 airstrikes and nearly 350 artillery strikes between last Wednesday and Monday in an offensive against fighters of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, in neighboring Iraq. Around 80 people have been wounded in the push, the military said. On Sunday night, a PKK spokesman said no rebels had been killed. Turkish armed forces are striking what the country calls PKK ""safe havens"" and ""attack bases"" in the region. Targets included rebel barracks, caves, ammunition depots and anti-aircraft positions in the region, part of Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region. Dozens of Turkish soldiers have been killed over the last month, in a clear escalation of the conflict that has raged intermittently between Kurdish separatists and the Turkish state since 1984. More than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict, many of them ethnic Kurds. The Kurds are Turkey's largest ethnic minority. Turkish authorities have not responded to reports from the Iraq's Kurdish authorities that a family of seven civilians was killed by an airstrike on Sunday.","Around 80 people have been wounded, Turkish military says .

"On the same day that thousands of women stood up to participate in One Billion Rising, billed as the largest mass action to stop violence against women and girls, the sad news came from South Africa that yet another woman was killed. The reason we took notice of 30-year-old Reeva Steenkamp's death among so many others killed every day is the shocking news that the man charged with killing her, her boyfriend, is none other than Oscar Pistorius, the athlete known as ""Blade Runner,"" a double amputee whose Olympic feats on prosthetic carbon fiber legs made him an international superstar. We don't know what the investigation will uncover, but Steenkamp's life is now lost. Coincidentally, the Pistorius case happens around Valentine's Day, the date that Rising activists marked to bring focus on the crisis of violence against women. Nike's bullet ad with Pistorius backfires . Brutal attacks against girls and women have stirred the world's conscience with increasing frequency in recent months. There is no question that many societies are finally becoming fed up with the much-too-common practice of attacking, raping and killing women that goes on in all corners of the world. The perpetrators of these crimes are invariably cowards, using superior physical force to intimidate or exert power. We have come to know some of their victims. Remember Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani girl targeted by the Taliban because she proclaimed that every girl has a right to an education. She has survived and vowed to continue her struggle despite the Taliban's promise they will try to kill her. The contrast in courage could not be starker. Then there is Nirbhaya, the New Delhi university student who was gang raped in a bus. She died of her horrific injuries, but her assault moved India and the entire world so deeply that her legacy has fueled the battle to stop this violence. Earlier this month, in a case gruesomely reminiscent of Nirbhaya, 17-year-old Anene Booysen was raped, mutilated and left for dead, in the South African city of Capetown. Just as Malala has inspired girls to demand an education, Nirbhaya has awakened India to the need for better laws and law enforcement to protect women. And, until the authorities get their act together, fierce Indian girls are learning self-defense. No wonder the Billion Rising celebrations have been such a hit all over India. Organizers say ""Risings"" are taking place in 203 countries. If true, that means women in a majority of countries on Earth could heed the call to stand, and to dance. Yes, to dance as a sign of ""solidarity, purpose and energy"" to ""shake the world."" A global push to end violence with song and dance . Amid the celebration, however, it's important to keep in mind what the occasion marks. According to U.N. statistics, one in three women will experience violence in her lifetime, including beating, rape or assault, making such violence a more prevalent problem than AIDS, malaria or any other disease. It means 1 billion women alive at this moment will become part of that statistic, hence the One Billion Rising. Women used to keep their assaults quiet, out of shame or fear of being ostracized. But less so today. There's Lara Logan, the CBS correspondent attacked by thugs in Cairo's Tahrir Square while covering the Egyptian revolution, one of countless women assaulted in Egypt by gangs of men. Some female democracy protesters, fighting for their rights, were later subjected to ""virginity tests"" by the Egyptian military. The problem has deep roots and far-reaching ramifications. Women have endured the use of rape as a weapon of war, and domestic violence as a tool of control at home. Domestic violence is one of those old traditions that should have died long ago. A 2012 study by UNICEF found most youngsters in India believe wife-beating is justified. But other surveys found the problem knows no national boundaries. The U.N. says about 14,000 Russian women die every year from domestic violence. In some countries, women are subjected to violence as retaliation for other family members' or their own perceived offenses in so-called ""honor killings."" In war zones, fighters rape women to humiliate their enemies, to perpetrate ""ethnic cleansing"" and to force people to leave. An incredible 92% of Liberian women in one study said they had been raped in that country's war. As you read this, women are being raped in Syria, in the Congo and in other countries where wars rage. After the violation, many of them will be rejected by their families. Violence against women tends to go hand in hand with lack of equality. It also is a sign of a malfunctioning society.  It is a stubborn problem, but one that responds to measures, such as those just approved after a perplexing political battle in the United States. As the world changes, as countries emerge from poverty and people fight for their rights, we can look to the level of violence against women as one of the gauges of their success. The Arab Human Development Reports of 2002 and 2005 said the low status of women is one of the reasons Arab countries had stagnated, calling the rise of women ""a prerequisite for an Arab renaissance."" Pistorius' South Africa, a country with a storied history in the fight for racial equality, has a disturbing record of violence against women. Around the world, the awareness and determination of women to stand up to violence are a major step forward. But tragedies such as the killing of Steenkamp in South Africa, one of countless occurring just today, are a reminder of the urgency of the cause. Any country, any society that wants to move forward and earn a place of honor among the nations must make it a priority to teach men from the earliest age that violence against women in any form is unacceptable, and those who hurt or intimidate women should be punished.","One Billion Rising mass action is raising awareness of violence against women .

"RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's streets were eerily quiet and empty early Friday after a night of anger and anguish following the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Bhutto supporters grieve at the hospital in Rawalpindi where was pronounced dead. Bhutto's body arrived in the hours before dawn at her ancestral village of Garhi-Khuda Baksh for burial after a long journey from Rawalpindi, where she died, by transport plane, helicopter and ambulance. The former prime minister's family -- her husband and three children -- accompanied the body aboard a Pakistani Air Force C-130 transport plane to Sukkor but traveled by bus from there to Larkana and on to Garhi-Khuda Baksh. The funeral is planned for Friday afternoon. In Washington, White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said Bhutto's family had requested a private funeral. Bhutto, 54, was killed Thursday by the bullets of an assassin who blew himself up after firing the shots, killing at least 28 more people and wounding at least 100, GEO-TV reported. Bhutto, who was campaigning for next month's parliamentary elections, had completed an election rally minutes earlier and was leaving the rally site, Rawalpindi's Liaquat Bagh Park, at the time of the attack. As a shocked Pakistan absorbed the news of Bhutto's death, authorities called for calm and asked residents to stay inside. Many obliged, shuttering shops or rushing home from work and surrendering the streets to protesters who set fire to banks, shops and gas stations, blocked streets and pelted police with rocks, Pakistani media reported. At least five people were killed in Karachi in the violence, GEO TV reported, and dozens more were wounded. Police in Khairpur fired on an angry mob, killing two people, the station reported, and two more people were killed in Larkana. It's all mayhem everywhere,"" Shehryar Ahmad, an investment banker in Karachi, told CNN by telephone. ""There's absolutely no order of any kind. No army on the streets. No curfew."" Ahmad said that he saw dozens of burned-out cars as he drove home from work. A one-mile strip leading to Bhutto's Karachi house was a ""ghost town,"" he said. Bhutto's body was being transported to the family's ancestral graveyard in Gari-Khuda Baksh in Sindh province, where she will be buried later Friday, said Sen. Safdar Abbasi, a leader of her Pakistan People's Party.  Watch how the tragedy unfolded » . The first leg was completed when, according to Pakistani TV stations, a Pakistan Air Force plane landed at Sukkur at about 3:15 a.m. Friday (5:30 p.m. Thursday ET). Bhutto's body was accompanied by her husband and three children. Bhutto is expected to be taken the rest of the way to her ancestral home by helicopter. Authorities are avoiding road travel because it could be mobbed by grieving supporters, the television stations reported. Her coffin body was removed from Rawalpindi General Hospital late Thursday -- carried above a crowd of grieving supporters.  Watch Bhutto's casket carried from the hospital » . Bhutto spent her final moments giving a stirring address to thousands of supporters at a political rally in a park in Rawalpindi, a city of roughly 1.5 million that is 14 km (9 miles) south of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. She climbed into a white Land Rover and stood through the sunroof to wave to crowds after the speech. It was then that someone fired two shots, and Bhutto slumped back into the vehicle, said John Moore, a news photographer with Getty Images who saw what happened. Seconds later an explosion rocked the park, sending orange flames into the throng of Bhutto supporters and littering the park with twisted metal and chunks of rubble. The carnage was everywhere, he said. The assassination happened in Liaquat Bagh Park, named for Pakistan's first prime minister -- Liaquat Ali Khan -- who was assassinated in the same location in 1951. The attack came just hours after four supporters of former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif died when members of another political party opened fire on them at a rally near the Islamabad airport Thursday, Pakistan police said. Several other members of Sharif's party were wounded, police said. Bhutto, who led Pakistan from 1988-1990 and 1993-96, but both times the sitting president dismissed her amid corruption allegations. She was the first female prime minister of any Islamic nation, and was participating in the parliamentary election set for January 8, hoping for a third term as prime minister.

"""Uncle"" Hammad, a local Bedouin camel farmer is staring at me as though I've offended him. I'm midway through a luxurious sand safari exploring the deserts of Dubai, and Hammad has been chatting to me over a traditional Emirati breakfast of cardamom-scented crepes slathered in date honey. I've asked him how he's been affected by Dubai's transformation from desert outpost to international city in the space of 25 years, and now I'm bracing myself for a lecture on the blight of modernity and how materialists like me are tainting his land. ""My grandfather had a tent and a camel ..."" He pauses and raises his graying eyebrows at me, then his face crinkles into a sun-beaten smile. ""And I have a five-bedroom villa with AC, and a race horse! Do you think I don't like that?"" Turns out he's a happy man. Dubai's Bedouin are no longer dusty nomads searching for a home -- they're now a part of the emirate's modern landscape of glamorous golf estates, tall towers, shopping malls and theme parks. Despite appearances, their history and natural culture can still be explored, as I discovered a day earlier when I joined the Platinum Heritage safari team at the edge of the Dubai Conservation Reserve. Pristine desert . The platinum part of this safari refers to the Reserve, Dubai's most pristine desert, but could also refer to the five-star treatment we receive while exploring it. The heritage? Open-top Land Rovers from the 1950s, bumblebee yellow or racing green, older than the unified country they're driving across, wheels like concrete, sounding like lawn mowers. Before we set off, Sharaf, our Egyptian mirror aviator-shaded driver, brought out some black and white keffiye headscarves. As we wrapped ourselves under instruction, I cringed on the inside -- who doesn't feel like a charlatan in another culture's national dress? -- but soon found out how necessary they were. When the cars pick up speed they throw up sand and the tail of the headscarf can be pulled over to give faces protection from the grit. There was to be no ""dune bashing"" on this trip, explained Sharaf. Apart from the obvious incompatibility with these classic cars, it can be devastating to the desert eco-system. It kills off sensitive environments for animals living under ground, which make up 95% of the land fauna found in the natural areas of Dubai. We weaved gently over dunes and stopped at various points for photographs. In some, the sands were golden, bare and desolate, scattered with the bones of petrified trees, disappearing in waves to the horizon. In other areas sands were tawny, shaded by giant ghaf trees and Arabian gums, with scrub protecting the tiny animals dwelling there. Aerial acrobatics . At one meager watering hole, delicate gazelles and lumbering oryx waited on the perimeter. They weren't camera shy, but they wouldn't return until we left. Later we were driven to a higher point where carpets were arranged on the sand before a natural amphitheater. Falcons waited on a roost, hooded but untethered. DEWA the Peregrine (named after the local power company whose lines this lazy bird likes to sit on) and Wasp, a Barbary falcon, put on a show with their trainer as the sun disappeared over the city lights of distant Dubai. The birds never touched us, but beat our heads with bursts of air as they swooped close enough to make us squeal. At dusk we entered our camp for the night -- a stone-ringed compound established by Sheikh Butti al Maktoum, and provided to Platinum Heritage on the proviso that they provide a genuine insight to Emirati culture. We talked with the few other passengers and drivers over dates and gahwa (Arabic coffee), before the ouzi (spiced, whole roasted lamb) was brought from its charcoal pit. In desert silence we ate traditional food, delicious and exotic -- even to me, a longtime resident of Dubai. As lgeimats (addictive little Emirati donuts) were brought out, we were entertained with traditional Khaleeji dances in which women sway their long, black hair, and Yolas, in which men tap rhythms with camel canes. We smoked shisha seated on rugs around a bonfire until the desert chill sent us to bed in our camelhair tent nearby. Scary driving . The Platinum Heritage experience is different from many desert safaris on offer. The others range in the details and intensity, but the formula is usually the same -- pickup in a white Land Cruiser, travel in convoy to the edge of the desert where tires are deflated for traction in the sand. Drivers proceed to scare the wits out of tourists by throwing the cars over dunes in a way I'm sure Toyota would revoke their warranties for. I once took a GoPro camera on one of these drives. All the footage I got was sand and sky, glimpses of the interior of the car and howls of a freaked out Scotswoman in the back seat, a broken record of ""No, no, no, no, no, no, nooooooo!"" punctuated by an occasional squeak or the sound of someone gagging. Some of these safaris then round off the terror with disappointment -- an evening in a fenced compound filled with camels and quad bikes, a low quality buffet, beers and a belly dancer from Russia. I've been on too many of these, not realizing what I was really missing out on until now. The morning brings both sunshine and a clear head. The cold breeze of the night has cleaned the sands, leaving only the prints of mystery desert fauna. Hammad laughs and chatters as if we're family, welcoming us into a culture that remains hidden for so many visitors to the UAE. He shows us that it's there for anyone to find, they just need to know where to look. How to explore the sands . Platinum Heritage offers a range of safari options, including the vintage Land Rover tours, private night safaris, dinner safaris, camel safaris, wildlife drives and Bedouin breakfasts and falconry experiences. If dune bashing and belly dancing are more your thing, Arabian Adventures is the largest operator. There are others. Those who prefer to do the driving themselves should get in touch with Off Road Zone, which runs half-day desert driving courses. Al Maha Resort offers the nature without the adventure, but with a whole lot of luxury. The resort is connected to the Dubai Conservation Reserve and has gazelles and oryx wandering free within its grounds. Prices start at about 6,000 AED ($1,600) per room per night.","Vintage Land Rover safaris explore the delicate sand dunes of Dubai .

"(CNN) -- An Air Force fighter pilot died Wednesday after two F-15C jets collided during a training exercise over the Gulf of Mexico, according to Air Force officials. Two F-15C fighter jets, like the one pictured, collided over the Gulf of Mexico, the Air Force says. The planes were from the 33rd Fighter Wing, a combat-flying unit out of Eglin Air Force Base, near Pensacola, Florida. A spokesman for the wing said the pilot died after having been rescued by a fishing boat and transported to the hospital at the base. The pilot of the other jet was also rescued and was listed in good condition, he said. The crash happened at about 3 p.m. ET, about 50 miles south of Tyndall Air Force Base which is in Panama City, Florida. A statement from the 33rd said the pilots were rescued at about 6 p.m. ET. ""The 33rd FW Nomads and Team Eglin have suffered a great loss today and my heart goes out to the family and friends of our former airman,"" said wing commander Col. Todd Harmer in a written statement. ""We will continue to do everything we can to assist our families and airmen at this tragic time."" Capt. Jim McPherson of the Coast Guard told CNN the crew of a Coast Guard aircraft on a training mission spotted a parachute dropping into the Gulf Wednesday afternoon. The crew used radar and an automated identification system to detect a fishing boat in the area and directed that boat to the area where the parachute landed. The Air Force was not identifying the pilots late Wednesday pending notification of their families. Harmer said both were ""assigned to the wing for quite some time."" He said the Air Force will convene a board of officers to investigate the crash and determine its cause. E-mail to a friend .

"Going to the Academy Awards has been dangerous for Jennifer Lawrence. For two years, the actress couldn't seem to stay upright at the event, tripping once in 2013 when walking to the stage to accept her Oscar for ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" and then falling again when arriving for the ceremony this March. So is Lawrence really that accident-prone, or are her repeat tumbles some sort of scheme to become more relatable, and thus more likable? Well if it is a plot, Lawrence tells Marie Claire in its June issue, she'd be smarter about executing it. At the 2014 Oscars, Lawrence says she was ""trying to do the right thing"" as she got out of her limo. She was ""waving to fans, trying to be nice, and there's a traffic cone,"" she recalls. ""The second I hit it, I was laughing, but on the inside I was like, 'You're f****d. They're totally going to think this is an act...' But trust me if I was going to plan it, I would have done it at the Golden Globes or the SAGs. I would have never done it at two Oscars in a row. I watch 'Homeland' -- I'm craftier than that!"" That kind of answer is exactly the reason fans adore Lawrence; she's uber-talented but also down-to-earth enough to freak out on a reporter who spoiled the last season of ""Homeland."" Yet the Kentucky-bred star insists that becoming famous has worn off some of her Average Jane charm, telling Marie Claire that these days, she's ""a lot more closed off and frankly probably rude."" ""I mean, I'm from Kentucky. I used to be very personable and make eye contact and smile at people, and now all I do is look down,"" the 23-year-old says. ""When I'm at dinner and one person after another keeps interrupting to take pictures, it's like, 'I can't live like this.' "" But one thing Lawrence has learned to live with is a long-distance relationship. Both the actress and her boyfriend, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" co-star Nicholas Hoult, are busy building their careers, and they've agreed it's OK to ""mutually ignore each other"" for a bit when necessary.

"Dressed in police and army uniforms, the suicide bombers placed themselves among the security officials lined up to cast their ballots. The soldiers and police were waiting to vote early, ahead of Wednesday's parliamentary elections -- Iraq's first nationwide polls since the withdrawal of U.S. forces at the end of 2011. But the men, charged with protecting polling stations and voters on election day, came under attack themselves as the militants detonated explosives, killing and injuring dozens of people across the country. In an apparent attempt to derail the balloting process and discourage the rest of Iraq's 21.5 million registered voters from going to the polls, suicide bombers struck several polling stations as well as other locations in a wave of attacks in Baghdad and northern Iraq on Monday and Tuesday. With a surge in car bombings, assassinations and suicide attacks, the vote -- the fourth national election since the fall of longtime leader Saddam Hussein in 2003 -- is being held amid rapidly growing violence reaching levels not seen in more than five years. Across villages and cities in the shattered nation, the echoing deep boom of explosions has become all too familiar for Iraqis. ""We depend on God each time we leave the house, because you don't know what fate holds for you,"" one man said. Wave of attacks . Shootings and explosions across the country on Monday killed 53 people and wounded more than 100 others. In addition to the targeted polling stations, a suicide attacker killed at least 18 people and wounded 33 others at a Kurdish political gathering in the town of Khanaqin, 160 kilometers (100 miles) northeast of Baghdad. The gathering was in celebration of Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, who appeared on television casting his vote in Germany where he has been getting medical treatment. On Tuesday, at least 12 people were killed when twin roadside bombs exploded in a busy outdoor market in al-Saadiya, about 120 kilometers northeast of Baghdad. Another 18 were wounded, police officials told CNN. Iraq has tightened security measures ahead of the elections, banning vehicles from the streets on Tuesday night and closing roads in and out of the capital. But on the eve of the polls, the country is fast returning to the horrors of its recent past. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is battling for a third term in office but faces fierce opposition from political opponents, with sectarian violence at its most intense in more than five years. Deadly year . Iraq has been beset with political and sectarian violence for months, often pitting Sunnis -- a minority in Iraq -- against Shiite Muslims, who came to dominate the government after Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with more than 8,800 people killed, most of them civilians. Tensions continue to be fueled by widespread discontent among the Sunnis, who say they are marginalized by the Shiite-led government and unfairly targeted by heavy-handed security tactics. Sunni anger has made it easier for al Qaeda-linked militants to recruit and operate while eroding the public's cooperation with security forces. Violence flared just a few months ago because of the arrest of a Sunni lawmaker in Anbar's capital, Ramadi, and the dismantling of protest sites by the army in Falluja and Ramadi. Iraq's security forces, trained by the United States at a cost of billions of dollars, have been unable to dislodge the militants and instead are fighting pitched battles. Other endemic problems gripping the country include high unemployment levels, dilapidated infrastructure and services, and chronic corruption. Oil revenues have failed to improve the lives of most Iraqis. The vote . The dire security situation in which the elections are going ahead is reminiscent of the country's first post-Hussein elections in 2005, when threats from al Qaeda insurgents led to minimal turnouts in most Sunni provinces. Al-Maliki, whose State of Law alliance is seen as a front-runner, on Tuesday called on Iraqis to take part in the vote. ""Your presence and your insistence to exercise your legitimate national and historical right represents a real response to the terrorists and sectarianism and those who stand behind them,"" he said in a statement. Some 277 political entities across Iraq will compete for 328 seats of the Iraqi Council of Representatives, the country's parliament. There are 9,032 candidates. The voting has been canceled in parts of Anbar province, controlled by jihadists and tribesmen. ""It doesn't bode well for stability if the electoral results do not reflect an accurate representation of the political realities on the ground,"" Ramzy Mardini, nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, told CNN. ""What's more worrisome is, what happens next? Will the government double down on a military offensive in Anbar? Does fighting intensify between Sunni tribes? Does Maliki take advantage to exploit the divisions? Does the violence eventually spill over into Baghdad? Will Anbar be neglected, whereby it converges closer to the adjacent insurgency inside Syria? As is always the case with Iraq, nothing is inevitable, anything is possible."" Observing from outside . Following the last parliamentary election in 2010, it took nearly eight months of intense backdoor negotiations for Iraq's bickering politicians to finally form a government. This time, though, there are no U.S. forces on the ground, and Washington will be watching from afar. ""The United States is facing a dire situation in Iraq, whereby both instability in the political and security realms are converging,"" Mardini said. ""If there is no resolution in the upcoming post-election saga in forming a government, Iraq's security situation is expected to worsen. Unlike past electoral cycles, the United States lacks the influence to bring about a resolution, and without its military presence, the psychological effect that helped pacify political behavior is no longer there as a coolant."" Iraq's neighbors will also be keeping an eye out for any serious implications in a region that is still coming to terms with the geopolitical effects of the Arab Spring. For Iran, the unity of the Shiite political class is a core interest, because it determines the depth and scope of its influence in Iraq, Mardini said. ""A new emerging interest for Tehran could be the maintenance of the status quo in Baghdad,"" he said. ""The ousting of Maliki could symbolically undermine Tehran's efforts in safeguarding the survival of the Syrian regime in Damascus.""

"More than 200 bottlenose dolphins spent a second day penned in a cove by Japanese fishermen, U.S. conservationists said Sunday, many of them stressed and bloodied from their attempts to escape. The dolphins will spend a third night without food or rest in Taiji Cove before the fishermen likely start to slaughter them Monday for meat, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said. Until now, the fishermen have focused on selecting dolphins to be sold into captivity at marine parks and aquariums in Japan and overseas, the conservation group said. Twenty-five dolphins, including a rare albino calf, were taken on Saturday ""to a lifetime of imprisonment,"" and another 12 on Sunday, the group said. Two dolphins have died in the process. Environmental activists have been monitoring activities in the cove in southwest Japan, which is a focal point of the Taiji community's annual dolphin hunting season. Although the hunting of dolphins is widely condemned in the west, Japanese defend the practice as a local custom -- and say it is no different to the slaughter of other animals for meat. Caroline Kennedy, the recently installed U.S. ambassador to Japan, tweeted that she is ""deeply concerned by inhumaneness of drive hunt dolphin killing."" The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has been live-streaming video of events in the cove and posting frequent updates on Twitter. ""Many of the 200+ Bottlenose dolphins who are in still the cove are visibly bloody & injured from their attempts to escape the killers,"" one update Sunday said. Another appealed for people to do their part to end the demand for dolphins captured from the wild. ""Dolphin slaughter in Taiji continues because of the captive trade. Please do not support aquariums & parks with marine mammals,"" it said. Opinion: Eat fish, kill a dolphin? Slaughter under tarpaulins . The dolphins earmarked for slaughter include those with nicks or markings which make them less desirable as captives. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society described how about 40 to 60 local fishermen work with nets to divide up the pod, whose initial numbers were estimated by the group at more than 250. ""They tighten up the nets to bring each sub-group together then the skiffs push them toward the tarps. Under the tarps in the shallows is where the trainers work with the killers to select the 'prettiest' dolphins which will sell and make the best pay day for the hunters,"" the group said. ""But the process is brutal and stressful. Some of them die from injuries incurred during the manhandling or simply the stress."" Once the slaughter begins, it will turn the water in the cove red with blood, as documented in footage captured by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in the past. The fishermen will ""kill the 'undesirable' dolphins (those with nicks and scars) under the tarps to hide from our cameras when that time comes,"" the group said. Officials say criticism is biased, unfair . CNN has been unable to reach anyone at the town office for Taiji, a community of about 3,000 that juts into the Pacific Ocean, or the local fishermen's union for comment. But local officials have reacted angrily in the past to Western criticism of what they say is a traditional practice dating back centuries. A 2009 Oscar-nominated documentary film, ""The Cove,"" brought the issue of dolphin hunting in Taiji to the fore with bloody scenes of dolphin slaughter. The Wakayama Prefecture, where Taiji is, condemned the film in an online response as distorted, biased and unfair to the fishermen. ""The Taiji dolphin fishery has been a target of repeated psychological harassment and interference by aggressive foreign animal protection organizations,"" it said. ""Taiji dolphin fishermen are just conducting a legal fishing activity in their traditional way in full accordance with regulations and rules under the supervision of both the national and the prefectural governments. Therefore, we believe there are no reasons to criticize the Taiji dolphin fishery."" The Japanese practice of whale hunting has also put it in conflict with the views of much of the world. Japan's fleet carries out an annual whale hunt despite a worldwide moratorium, taking advantage of a loophole in the law that permits the killing of the mammals for scientific research. Whale meat is commonly available for consumption in Japan. Environmental activists warn that dolphin meat, also sold for consumption in Japan, contains dangerously high levels of mercury and other toxins. CNN first learned about this story through a CNN iReport posted by Martha Brock, an environmental attorney and activist in Georgia. ""There are activists around the world that are calling the embassy and the press, but I knew I couldn't do much, so I wrote this iReport,"" she said.","Fishermen have taken 37 bottlenose dolphins to be sold into captivity, conservationists say .
Many of the 200 dolphins still in the cove in Taiji, Japan, will be slaughtered, they say .

"China is building an island in the South China Sea that could accommodate the country's first airstrip in bitterly contested waters, according to satellite images analyzed by IHS Jane's Defence Weekly. Reclamation at Fiery Cross Reef on the western edge of the disputed Spratly islands is creating a land mass that is more than 3,000 meters (2 miles) long and between 200 to 300 meters (650 to 980 feet) wide -- large enough to construct a runway and apron, the publication said. The South China Sea is the subject of numerous rival -- often messy -- territorial claims, with China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam disputing sovereignty of several island chains and nearby waters. The areas in dispute include fertile fishing grounds and potentially rich reserves of undersea natural resources. Jane's said that Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan had built airfields on reefs and islands in the contested waters. ""The work at Fiery Cross thus brings parity but is likely to cause alarm among the other claimants,"" the report said. ""Given its massive military advantage over the other claimants in terms of quantity and quality of materiel, this facility appears purpose-built to coerce other claimants into relinquishing their claims and possessions, or at least provide China with a much stronger negotiating position if talks over the dispute were ever held."" The report said that dredgers were creating a harbor large enough to receive tankers and warships. Construction 'legitimate' But Maj. General Luo Yuan of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) told the state-run Global Times that construction was justifiable and that the infrastructure would improve the living standards of soldiers stationed there. ""The construction and maintenance of facilities and other activities we conducted on these islands are within our sovereign rights and they are legitimate,"" he added. At a briefing on Monday, Hua Chunying, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said that China has ""indisputable sovereignty"" over the islands in the South China Sea and said the construction would help in case of search and rescue efforts. China's stance on maritime disputes has put it at odds with many of its smaller neighbors. Earlier this year, it moved an oil rig near the disputed Paracel Islands triggering anti-Chinese riots in Vietnam. Relations have also soured with the Philippines. On Monday, a Philippines court convicted nine Chinese fishermen of poaching hundreds of endangered giant sea turtles from a disputed shoal in the South China Sea.  They were each fined nearly $103,000 but face no jail term. Diplomatic initiatives . The United States has supported efforts by regional group ASEAN to draw up a code of conduct to defuse maritime disputes, but China has said it prefers to deal with the issue bilaterally. On Friday, a Pentagon spokesman told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that the U.S. wanted China to stop its land reclamation program and engage in diplomatic initiatives. In a speech at the G20 summit earlier this month, President Barack Obama said the U.S. planned to deepen its diplomatic and military engagement in Asia and would work to ensure that big nations don't ""bully the small."" An editorial posted in the Global Times, said that Vietnam, the Philippines and the U.S. should ""get used"" to China's island construction and its more frequent presence in the seas.","Jane's Defence Weekly: China building island in the South China Sea that could accommodate airstrip.

"Federal airport screeners still find four to five guns at checkpoints on a typical day, the Transportation Security Administration's chief told a Senate hearing Wednesday. ""Yesterday we found six, including one at ...  Bradley (airport in Connecticut) -- a loaded gun with seven rounds in it, in a checked bag that (a passenger) was trying to get through,"" Administrator John Pistole said. Passengers typically say they forgot the weapon was in their bag, TSA officials said. But in one recent case, a passenger at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport tried to board a plane with two pistols, three ammunition magazines, eight knives and a hand saw in a carry-on bag, the TSA said. That passenger was arrested by local law enforcement. More than 900 guns have been recovered at checkpoints this year, the TSA says. At a wide-ranging Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing, Pistole mentioned the Connecticut gun find as evidence of the effectiveness of the agency. Pistole also touted his program to expedite screening for trusted travelers, full-body scanners which can find nonmetallic items and ""Behavior Detection Officers,"" some of whom now question passengers in an effort to ferret out terrorists. More than 150,000 people have gone through the ""expanded"" behavior detection at Boston Logan International Airport, Pistole said. ""We've had probably a dozen or so people who were referred to law enforcement because of their response,"" he said. ""And it turned out, some of these individuals had outstanding warrants for them. Some were illegal immigrants."" Pistole said the expanded behavior detection is being tested in Boston and Detroit, adding, ""I want to get the data from those two airports before I make any decisions whether to expand it or not."" He said he would report back to the committee on the results at the test airports. Senators at the hearing generally praised the TSA for its work. But members of the travel industry, who testified after Pistole, said that current passenger-screening procedures were stifling travel and need to be improved. ""Since 2004, TSA's overall budget has increased by 68%. During the same time period, passenger levels have remained almost the same,"" said Roger Dow, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. ""TSA is spending more money each year to screen the same amount of passengers."" Dow cited a 2008 survey in which 28% of air travelers said they avoided at least one trip because of the hassles of air travel, which included aviation congestion and passenger screening. Airline fees for checked luggage are prompting people to bring more carry-on bags, adding to checkpoint congestion, Dow said. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, said she would introduce legislation requiring airlines to include at least one bag in the price of a ticket, in an effort to reverse the trend and speed up inspections at checkpoints.","TSA Administrator John Pistole gives update on ""behavior detection""

"All nations that hold large, aerospace expositions are on some level hoping that they will create the impression they have a modern industrial complex that puts them into the exclusive ""club"" of nations that build their own planes -- or at least some of the important components that go into them. Most of the air shows in the international calendar -- Le Bourget in France, Singapore, Dubai, Farnborough -- follow this template and they are commercially successful because they provide a forum for companies to meet with their customers and showcase what their products are capable of. Airshow China, which takes place in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai this week, aims to showcase the People's Republic's emergence as a world-class aerospace and defense power and gives us a rare glimpse of China's home-grown military hardware. However, it is more like the Russian national air show, MAKS, than other international events in that it is designed to impress the Chinese government, Communist Party and military officials -- specifically the Central Military Commission -- rather than a vehicle to convince plane makers Boeing, Airbus, Embraer or Gulfstream of the opportunities available in the Chinese market. Commercial vs. military . Ask an executive working on one of Boeing's fighter aircraft, military helicopter or missile programs about their importance to the corporate bottom line and he or she will tell you that Boeing is an 80% or more commercial company. The business of building big commercial aircraft like the 787 Dreamliners and 737s is what keeps Boeing running, providing the economies of scale that allow the company to have a military aircraft division. Without the commercial airliner business there would be no F-15s or F/A-18s being built at Boeing's St. Louis, Missouri plant. This is largely the case for almost all of the world's major military aircraft manufacturers, but it's definitely not the profile of China's aerospace industry. Several major aerospace plants -- Chengdu, Shenyang, Xi'an, Hongdu and others -- are almost completely geared towards the production of military aircraft. As yet, the country has no commercial airline programs that rival those of the West. The 168-seat C919 airliner being built by the Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) is supposed to someday be the nucleus of a fleet of Chinese-built passenger aircraft, but its business model is one that Western aerospace firms can only envy. The program is state-funded and launch customers are Chinese state-owned airlines that are likely to have little choice but to purchase or lease the C919, with first deliveries expected in late 2018. A number of foreign partners, including engine maker CFM International, provide an additional financial safety net and it's unlikely to meet the same difficulties as the Boeing 747, which almost took the company to the brink of bankruptcy when it was first developed. ""It's a program that by definition cannot fail,"" said one Western aerospace executive. ""And it has the highest possible priority.  It is clear that getting this aircraft off the ground is to the PRC what the U.S. race to the moon was against the Soviet Union in the 1960s."" Stealth fighters . The military arena is where China is likely to have the biggest impact. At least two new stealthy, next-generation combat aircraft -- the Chengdu J-20 and the Shenyang J-31, are under development -- making the managers of western fighter programs like the Lockheed Martin F-35 look nervously at what the next decades of military challenges from China might entail. China's defense industry also boasts multiple lines of anti-ship, air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles -- the kind that give U.S, Navy carrier battle group commanders and Air Force Pentagon planners pause and make them stop and think about what the viable scenarios are -- if any - for defending Taiwan in the event of the breakout of hostilities. However, most military aircraft firms can only survive financially if they have a fairly robust export market. Several programs are based on the concept of shared costs among multiple nations because of the huge expense involved in developing modern-day defense technologies. So far, China is going it alone -- building fleets of fighters and bombers almost exclusively for the People's Liberation Army--- with very few foreign clients. Therefore, the biggest questions at this year's Airshow China may be how long can China afford to be building military aircraft that are ""for China only"" and how soon will Beijing realize that growing its export market is the only way it can continue to afford to maintain this massive military machine.","Airshow China takes place in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai this week.

"A conservative blogger is in jail -- arrested for allegedly breaking into a Mississippi nursing home to photograph U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran's ailing wife, who is suffering from dementia. ""It's the worst,"" says the narrator of a new Cochran campaign ad airing in the final stretch before the June 3 primary, not so subtly pointing the finger at his GOP Senate challenger, Chris McDaniel, trying to stir up voter disgust. This race, one of the nastiest so far this election year, has gotten even deeper in the Mississippi mud than that. Cochran supporters argue the reason the blogger and tea party activist took Mrs. Cochran's picture was to feed questions about the senator and his longtime aide, Kay Webber. Cochran: Quiet pragmatist faces re-election challenge . Conservative outlets that back McDaniel have been all over the fact Cochran rents a basement apartment in Webber's D.C. home, and that Webber has traveled extensively with Cochran on the taxpayer's dime. McDaniel's campaign often forwards these reports to its media email list, while the Cochran campaign calls her trips with the senator part of her job and suggestions of anything untoward are sexist. New ads in nasty Mississippi primary . This Republican primary was supposed to be about the big struggle of ideas within the GOP: a 36-year Senate veteran being challenged by a young tea party-backed opponent who calls the senator a big-spending, out-of-touch Republican too entrenched in Washington. Now McDaniel is fending off questions about whether his campaign was involved in trying to photograph Cochran's sick wife. ""Our campaign had absolutely no connection to that whatsoever, and the evidence has shown that. What we're doing right now -- we're talking about the issues,"" McDaniel told CNN in an interview. The next Ted Cruz? But what gave ammunition to Cochran allies is that McDaniel's story about when he found out about the break-in has been inconsistent. When we asked for clarification, McDaniel wouldn't go there, replying, ""Look, we're going to focus on his record."" Three more arrested in Mississippi Senate primary scandal . If McDaniel has his way, he would be the next Ted Cruz, going to the Senate to shake things up -- stick to conservative principles, compromise be damned. ""We don't have six more years of the status quo,"" he said. ""I am not going to Washington D.C. to be a member of the cocktail circuit or to make backroom deals. I'm going up there to fight and defend the Constitution. We don't have time to waste. So with all due respect I would suggest they join me in this fight because they've been silent far too long,"" he told us. ""He and I are very different with our ideology. He's a guy that believes in big government. He believes in big spending. He believes in increasing taxes. He believes in increasing his own pay. I am not that guy,"" McDaniel said. For the tea party movement nationwide -- after a string of primary losses this election year from Kentucky to Idaho -- McDaniel has been its great hope of 2014, the candidate with the best chance of toppling an establishment Republican. Things were looking good for McDaniel earlier this year, especially after Cochran stumbled by telling a local reporter here that ""the tea party is something I don't really know a lot about."" Millions of dollars pouring into Mississippi against Cochran come from a who's who of national tea party groups nationwide: Citizens United, Club For Growth, Senate Conservatives Fund, Tea Party Patriots and Freedomworks. The Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks money in politics, says outside groups have spent $7.6 million on the race, much of it for McDaniel and against Cochran. 2014 midterms: Key races . Fighting back against tea party challenges . But like other Republican incumbents this year, Cochran and his allies are fighting back hard. Henry Barbour, nephew of former Mississippi governor and RNC chairman Haley Barbour, formed a super PAC called Mississippi Conservatives to help Cochran. They have been airing aggressive ads slamming McDaniel as extreme, inconsistent and out of touch with Mississippi's needs. Other traditional GOP groups like the Chamber of Commerce have also come in with ads supporting Cochran, like they have for GOP incumbents in other states this year. Still, Cochran's four decades in Washington have won him loyal supporters. On Memorial Day, Cochran attended an event in Vicksburg. He was invited by the Democratic mayor, George Flaggs, who called him a ""mentor"" and ""great friend."" Flaggs told CNN he intends to vote for Cochran in the GOP primary since Mississippi law allows Democrats and others not registered as Republicans to participate. He said Cochran fights hard for Mississippi's needs and calls his seniority -- ranking Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, a big plus for the state. ""He's a leader; he's a statesman, and he's what we need in Washington. So stay as long as he wants to stay,"" Flagg said. Republican Briggs Hopson serves with McDaniel in the Mississippi state Senate, and told CNN he likes McDaniel but that Cochran is the ""best person for Mississippi right now."" ""Seniority can be a plus. People can lose touch and get lazy and all those things but I don't think that's the case with Senator Cochran. He's been responsive to the needs in Mississippi for many years,"" Hopson told CNN. 'Those days are over' When we put those bipartisan sentiments to McDaniel he responded with an emphatic, ""come on!"" ""I say name one fight Senator Cochran's lead against Barack Obama. Name one time he's raised his voice in defense of conservatism. Name one time he's fought back the liberal agenda. Name one piece of legislation he's authored in 42 years that benefited the conservative cause. Name one thing that he's been outwardly aggressive about. And they can't name one,"" McDaniel told CNN. ""Look, there may have been a time for that in 1973 when he first went to Washington. Maybe when Richard Nixon was president that was the thing people did. Those days are over."" We wanted to ask Cochran himself why he thinks he should get another six years, after serving 36 in the U.S. Senate and six before that in the House. But Cochran is trying to run out the clock and avoid unforced errors -- and going to head-scratching extremes to avoid talking to reporters like us. We tried to catch Cochran after his event in Vicksburg, but when an aide came out and saw us waiting, they did a bait and switch -- the car they told us Cochran was getting into screeched away without him, while he snuck out another door and left in another car, leaving reporters in the dust.

"Beijing, China (CNN)Hu Mingming lands spin-kicks and splits with ease, but her hands are shaking too much to tie a bow. She is a student at the famous Henan Shaolin Martial Arts School. In recent years, their gravity-defying brand of kung fu has become a staple of the annual televised Lunar New Year Gala. ""Last year I watched my classmates perform on stage and I felt nervous for them. Now it is my turn,"" says Hu. She has a right to be nervous. The gala, a variety show broadcast on state television since 1983, is a cultural phenomenon and a key propaganda tool of the Chinese Communist Party. It's also a ratings juggernaut. Combine the viewers of the Oscars, Emmys, American Idol finales and MTV Video Music Awards -- then throw in the Super Bowl ratings for good measure -- you are not even close. Organizers like to say that more than 90% of Chinese families tune in. Last year, it drew more than 700 million viewers. ""There is a huge amount of pressure,"" says Zhang Hu,  Hu's coach, who has also performed in the gala. ""And each rehearsal is like an inspection."" Just days before the real deal and after months of practice, the producers are still cutting segments to fine tune the show to around 36 acts. At Saturday's rehearsal, performers hustled backstage near studio doors manned by security guards in white gloves. Chinese opera singers adjusted their elaborate headgear; 5-year-old acrobats swarmed around movie stars and a group of glamorous dancers posed for selfies. In pictures: Lunar New Year 2015 . On the sidelines of the mayhem, the acrobats, crooners and pop starlets all had the same mantra for me: This year the gala is going global. They are impressively on message. In recent months, state broadcaster CCTV has touted business deals with YouTube, Google and Twitter to reach out to a global audience with coverage of this year's Gala. Never mind that all of those websites are blacked out by Communist Party censors inside of China, provoking widespread ridicule by Chinese netizens. ""Different countries have different Internet regulations. It's not up to us,"" said Jing Chunhan, a spokesman for CCTV, adding that the Chinese have plenty of ways to watch inside China. CCTV has even rented a video billboard in the heart of New York's Time Square to plug the show. Some academics see it as an unusually overt push to win hearts and minds amongst the some fifty million Chinese in the diaspora. ""This aggressive push for Chinese soft power is new,"" says Tao Xie, a professor of International Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University.  ""The approach in the past used to be cautious and low profile."" For soft power to work, though, the gala needs to stay relevant. When it began more than three decades ago, there wasn't much else on offer for entertainment in China. Now, even the heavily censored Chinese internet is stiff competition. Last year, young Chinese started a meme online with photos of their relatives sleeping through the gala on the couch. But watching the program is still a force of habit for many Chinese. Xu Baoyu, a college senior at the University of Iowa, says she used to watch the show because it was ""just there."" On Wednesday, she says she will be watching the gala on YouTube from her off campus apartment in Iowa City. ""The Spring Festival just doesn't feel complete without the gala,"" she told CNN by phone. ""Although I do like to mock the show while my mom is watching in China."" CNN's Serena Dong and Shen Lu contributed to this report.","China wants its annual Lunar New Year Gala to go global.

"(CNN) -- For sportsmen to form a pop group is rare, for a boy band to be forged from a sport often criticized as being the stuffy reserve of boring old men is something of a miracle. Not that the chances of future platinum-selling albums or world tours look particularly good for ""Golf Boys,"" if the standard of their first release ""Oh, Oh, Oh"" is anything to go by. Awkward dance moves, dubious costumes and with voices as thin as a sheet of paper; the foursome of Ben Crane, Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler and Hunter Mahan are hardly The Beatles. But the band -- who were created by world-ranked 44 Crane -- will not be disappointed if they fail to top the billboard charts because the quartet of PGA Tour players are singing and dancing for charity. The group's debut track -- which is a throwback to the 1990s boy band heyday of New Kids on the Block, NSync and Backstreet Boys -- has so far proved an internet sensation attracting over a million views on YouTube since it went live on June 13. In fact, three-times PGA Tour winner Crane, who was the driving force behind Golf Boys, has built a cult social media following over the last 12 months after uploading a host of comedy clips of himself. In one the 35-year-old took time to make fun of his reputation as a slow player -- prompting the PGA Tour website to suggest he'd been transformed from the, ""sultan of slow, to the lord of laughs."" ""My image, amongst some of the golfers, is slow golfer, nice guy,"" Crane told the PGA Tour. ""So when friends go from slow golfer, nice guy to 'Wow,' it's like the perfect storm of my image to the videos, it's such a contrast. It's had more effect because of it."" And Crane's latest production was designed to take things to the next level. After securing funding from Farmers Insurance, Crane convinced Watson, Fowler and Mahan to make it happen. ""We've got costumes, a studio rented and we're going for it. The boy band is coming back,"" he proudly stated in May. Farmers Insurance came on board through their involvement with Crane, a player they sponsor and who won the PGA Tour tournament they host in California last year. ""The proceeds will benefit charitable organizations designated by Farmers and Ben Crane,""said company vice president Mark Toohey. The timing of Golf Boys' debut release, during the 111th U.S. Open at Congressional Country Club in Maryland, only added to the hype. When the golfing world should be occupied with finding its next major champion, many will be talking about the Golf Boys' video -- and in particular the players' ridiculous outfits. Watson is shirtless in a pair of denim dungarees; Mahan in skin-tight leopard print pants and an open fur coat. Crane sports what looks like a cut-off wetsuit, while Fowler is resplendent in leather pants and an open leather jacket. The video opens with the foursome in staged boy band pose, before the camera pans in on each of their faces in slow motion. Then the choreographed dancing kicks in, with the players mixing studio moves with coordinated routines on the golf course. By the time the golf-themed lyrics kick in you begin to wonder how the players managed to keep a straight face long enough to film it. ""Chip, putt, you know, what's the big whoop? When I play my game, then I make my mama proud,"" sings Mahan. ""Smash, bang, you got to hit the ball far. When the crowd goes ooooh, then you hear the oo-da-la-li-la-li,"" continues Fowler. Fowler's involvement is particularly amusing when you consider his status as America's pop star golfer elect. The 22-year-old has been labeled ""the Jonas brother of golf"", on account of his boy-band good looks, and he attracts hoards of admiring fans wherever he goes. Quite what his role in Golf Boys will do to his appeal remains to be seen. While Crane's collective are clearly the first PGA Tour boy band, Golf Boys aren't the first professional golfers to try their hands at music. Two-times major winner John Daly has been known to pick up a guitar and sing on occasion, and has even written his own material. It's surely only a matter of time before Golf Boys invite him along for a cameo. ""Crane has talked about the potential of future videos,"" admitted Toohey. And with that, it's off to watch his latest clip - ""the making of Golf Boys"". Oo-da-la-li-la-li.","The ""Golf Boys"" release their first single ""Oh, Oh, Oh"" to coincide with the U.S. Open .

"Accra, Ghana (CNN) -- Ghana isn't the easiest place for people with disabilities. They are often viewed with suspicion, deemed unlucky, untrustworthy, or without value. ""Unfortunately, we associate disability with all manner of negative influences: with witchcraft, with the devil, with bad karma,"" explains Max Vardon, who formerly headed Ghana's National Council on Persons with Disabilities. ""They get relegated to the sidelines. The schooling they should get, the support from their families they should get, they don't, so life is very difficult for them,"" he adds. Lately, however, a number of Paralympic athletes are hoping to use sport to change public perceptions. One of the leading spokesmen for Ghana's physically challenged is Charles Narh Teye, one of a handful of Ghanaian para-athletes who competed in the London 2012 Paralympics. Narh Teye had both his legs amputated when he was one-month old. Today, he is a professional body builder who also owns his own gym. ""With the gym, I love it when people see me with my disability training able-bodied people,"" says Narh Teye, who is now training himself for the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. He uses his earnings to reinvest in Ghana's para-sports, an area he admits is under-financed. ""We do not have a qualified para-powerlifting bench here in Ghana, so we make do with the ones that able-bodied people use. Of course, that reduces our input and output."" A new game? Another group looking to bring attention to the cause is The Rolling Rockets, Ghana's skate soccer team made up of polio survivors. ""The sport is appreciated. I would say, in this country, it is admired by so many people,"" says Albert Frimpong, the team's coach. Skate soccer doesn't yet have Paralympic status, though it has garnered some attention in the last couple of years. In 2012, the story of the Rolling Rockets inspired a Kickstarter campaign for the documentary Rollaball. Earlier this year, the team was featured in a documentary and advertising campaign by Chevrolet. Frimpong initially formed the team to help get the men off the street. ""The idea was to get them to stop begging, to improve their lives. I was hoping to use soccer as a way to set up business- and income-generating projects for them,"" he recalls. Since then, his vision has expanded somewhat. ""One of the dreams is to organize an African Cup of Nations, the first ever in the world here in Ghana,"" he admits. ""We can get a big FIFA car to bring people here to come and watch, and the world will finally see them exhibiting their talent."" The next generation . The Accra Rehabilitation Centre is currently one of the few institutions working to provide economic opportunities to the country's physically challenged. The center is particularly keen to get their members involved in sports, not only for confidence-building, but for the sponsorship opportunities as well. ""We have so many people with disabilities who have competed on a world stage, and because of that, they are being introduced to heads of state,"" says Vardon. ""They have acquired a livelihood for themselves and for their families that they did not have before."" Another novel academy, called Right to Dream, is also hoping to nurture Ghana's future para-sportsmen. Headed by Raphael Botsyo Nkegbe and his protÃ©gÃ©, Maclean Atsu Dzidienyo -- both internationally recognized wheelchair racers -- the academy aims to educate Ghana's disabled community, and nurture their talent for sport. ""We work with some very disadvantaged kids in Ghana, and they come from environments where they don't actually know what opportunities are out there in the world. So when you bring them here, and tell them if you apply yourself you can achieve amazing things in life, they don't understand,"" says Nkegbe. ""Those who are competing are the new generation. They are the people taking over the baton.""","Charles Narh Teye lost both his legs as an infant. Now, he's a Paralympic body builder .

"(CNN) -- It's a surfer's paradise -- but Diah Rahayu is out on her own when it comes to professional women's wave-riding in Bali. Unlike many Indonesian girls, she's right at home on the beach. ""I think my soul is already in the water. The ocean just calls me, 'Come, come, come.' When I go to the beach, I feel like it's my home,"" she tells CNN's Human to Hero series. The 20-year-old is Bali's only native female pro surfer. The Indonesian island is a mecca for wave-seekers and beach-loving tourists, but of the locals it's mainly men who mix it up with the visitors. ""A lot of my friends say, 'Why do you like surfing? Surfing is dangerous.' It's not dangerous for me. It's very fun,"" Rahayu says. ""Indonesian girls are scared of getting dark skin and don't want to go surfing. And I'm the luckiest one, I love the beach."" Born in Seminyak, a coastal town in southern Bali that has been absorbed by the major tourist resort of Kuta, Rahayu has lived by the sea all her life. ""So many Australians come and act like bad tourists and make everything dirty,"" she told Surfing Life website last month. ""But no matter what I would never leave Bali, because I can surf amazing waves all-year-round and you can't do that anywhere else."" Her dad was a renowned local surfer, but he wasn't so keen when she said she wanted to follow in his footsteps. So the 12-year-old went behind his back and learned from her uncle instead. Two years later, she made a name for herself at a local talent contest and earned a sponsorship deal. The middle of three sisters, Rahayu says surfing has given her an identity. Unlike her father, who had to give up the sport to support the family, she has been able to combine competing with her university studies thanks to funding from Rip Curl -- one of surfing's major brands. ""I feel so lucky. No-one from Bali can surf. I don't want to be like any other girls,"" she says. ""I feel great because I can do something different. Everything in my life now is about surfing."" Rahayu's major breakthrough came when she won a bronze medal for Indonesia at the 2008 Asian Beach Games, which were held in Bali. ""I met the president, had an interview with him and we talked a lot,"" she recalls. ""It was really cool. And my mom and my dad were proud of me, and my name was in every newspaper."" The silver medal winner that year was Yasniar Gea. From the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra, she has gone on to become the most successful female Indonesian surfer. Rahayu competes against Gea on the Asian Surfing Tour, but says her biggest inspiration comes from women riding on the world stage -- such as leading Australians Stephanie Gilmore and Sally Fitzgibbons, and Hawaii's Carissa Moore. Joining them is still a pipe dream; she acknowledges she has yet to pay her dues on the Asian circuit. ""I want to win this tour. I want to focus on that -- it's my dream,"" Rahayu says. ""I'm not going to Europe yet, but I will. And I want to go to Australia, maybe next year."" But wherever she ends up, there's no place like home -- where already she's inspiring young girls to take up surfing. ""It feels so amazing, because now young girls are surfing and then taking pictures with a hashtag, and then just following me,"" she says. ""It's really good to get more girls surfing in Indonesia. I'm just trying to keep encouraging everyone to get in the water and enjoy life.""","Diah Rahayu is the only female Balinese surfer on the pro circuit .

"(CNN) -- The great Davos talking shop is now up and running, with delegates of all levels of importance, shapes and nationalities zeroing in on this quaint, alpine town to put the world to rights. For many ordinary people the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) is yet another ""important"" summit in the calendar where the elite of business and politics will schmooze for a few days in a rarefied environment they have little or no experience of. Whether or not you believe events such as Davos justify their lofty ambitions, they are certainly a unique experience. So how do you become a Davos delegate? Official invite . The World Economic Forum is strictly by invitation only, with 2,500 participants representing over 100 countries. The roll call includes CEOs and representatives from the world's biggest corporations; politicians and heads of state from the G20 and other key countries; technology innovators; social entrepreneurs; philanthropists and media companies. Adding to the exclusivity is the hefty price tag to attend. While the white badges are free for invited representatives of certain groups -- heads of state, faith leaders, academics, social entrepreneurs, members of international organizations and news anchors -- for businesses, the cost of a ticket is approximately $20,000. Huge travel budget . Getting to this small ski resort, nestled in a picturesque valley high up in the Swiss Alps 150 km south-west of Zurich, is not for the budget traveler. For a delegate arriving from New York this week flying business class, the price comes in at between $4,800 and $7,200. A visitor from Tokyo can expect to pay between $4,500 and $8,300, while a delegate flying in from Johannesburg, South Africa will pay around $4,900. And once in Zurich there's the small matter of the transfer to Davos. A regular shuttle bus and train service is available, but a two-hour trip by public transport may not suit the business client. The alternative would be a limousine which would cost around $700 for a one-way trip. However corporate CEOs may choose to come by helicopter, which last year cost around $9,500 for a return flight. Place to stay . Finding accommodation in Davos during the week of the World Economic Forum is not easy, with a limited number of large hotels. Predictably tariffs reflect the resulting demand/supply imbalance, with a room in a modest three-star hotel coming in at around $600 per night. Those with a considerably bigger budget often choose to rent out whole apartments or chalets. A chalet sleeping up to ten people for the week can command as much as $60,000 - though catering might just be included. The right outfit . It's cold in Davos, very cold. At 5,052 ft (1,540m) above see level, temperatures average -6 degrees Celsius (21.1 degrees Fahrenheit) in January. Thermal underwear, winter jackets and snow boots are a must, particularly when the temperature plummets in the evenings as you make your way to the various cocktail parties, meals and social events hosted by partner companies. It is not uncommon to see $2,000 bespoke suits finished off with bulky snow boots around the Congress Center. Spot the VIPs . For an outsider, the gathering in Davos might look like a big party for anyone who matters in the world. In reality, the meeting in Davos is ruled by a strict hierarchy. Access to some places is strictly for a a few dozens of heads of state, royalty, the CEOs of global corporate giants and the heads of a veritable alphabet soup of international organizations. How do you spot the very, very important people among the 2,500 delegates? Look for the badges. Anyone wearing a white badge is an official delegate, who got invited to the conference. Spouses of delegates and ""strategic partners,"" who sponsor the WEF, have similar badges. The most exclusive badge, the kind that gets you access to the behind the scenes secret society (officially known as the Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders), is the one with a holographic sticker. Knowing where to go . With all the above boxes ticked, it is essential to have a plan once you have run the gauntlet of airport-style security -- there are 4,000 Swiss troops in Davos this week -- and made it inside the newly-extended Congress Center with the correct color of identity pass. Some delegates do nothing but network with other delegates, oblivious to the feverish discussions going all around them about the post-crisis new reality. So delegates can spend four days roaming this cavernous indoor amphitheater attending conferences and workshops about everything from how the environment agenda will change in light of current trends and norms, to how music can transform communities and unite people. $40,000-per head well spent.

"Washington (CNN) -- A former National Security Agency official was sentenced to one year of probation and 240 hours of community service Friday for exceeding his authorized use of an agency computer. Thomas Drake pleaded guilty to that misdemeanor charge in June after government prosecutors agreed to drop more serious charges -- some of which fell under the Espionage Act -- which carried maximum penalties of 35 years in prison. Prosecutors had accused Drake, 54, of leaking information to a reporter and charged him last year in a 10-count indictment of willful retention of national defense information, obstruction of justice and making false statements. But prosecutors decided they could not pursue those charges in the controversial leak case after a federal judge in Baltimore, Maryland ruled classified information would have to be presented in open court. Drake could have been sentenced to a year in jail, but as part of the plea deal the government agreed not to push for him to serve time. In a sentencing memo, Drake's defense lawyers argued against their client spending time behind bars. ""The crime does not involve the handling or mishandling of classified information,"" said his lawyers. ""Rather, it relates to Mr. Drake's decision to communicate with a Baltimore Sun reporter about his belief that NSA was engaged in waste, fraud, and abuse."" The defense memo also said that since the investigation began in 2007, Drake ""has suffered emotionally, physically, professionally, and financially."" According to the memo, Drake's reputation has been so tarnished he'll never be able to work in the intelligence community again. He lost his security clearance and left government service five years before he would have been eligible for a federal pension. The memo said Drake had a part-time teaching position at Strayer University, but was let go after he was indicted. Drake worked at the NSA from 2001 until he resigned in April 2008. According to the defense lawyers' memo, he then went to work at an Apple retail store. The document said he had to take a second mortgage out on his home to help pay for a private attorney during the government's investigation. After the government indicted him, Drake qualified for the services of federal public defenders. Drake maintained he was acting as a whistleblower and raised objections to some of the NSA's actions within the NSA, to Congress and to a Defense Department Inspector General. According to the Washington Post, he was concerned about a $1.2 billion dollar data-sifting program called Trailblazer and about NSA efforts to collect Americans' e-mail and phone call information without court orders. In a statement of facts submitted in June, Drake admitted to accessing the NSA's intranet site, from approximately February 2006 through March 2007, where he ""obtained information, and provided said information orally and in writing to another person not permitted or authorized"" to receive it. Neither Drake's defense lawyers nor the Justice Department would comment after Drake was sentenced. But in June, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Lanny Breuer said in a written statement: ""Individuals who are granted special access to our nation's most sensitive information cannot unilaterally decide to disregard the law and agreements they make with the government on how that information may be handled.""","Thomas Drake is sentenced to one year probation and 240 hours of community service .

"Editor's note: William Jelani Cobb is associate professor of history at Spelman College and author of the forthcoming ""Change Has Come: Barack Obama and the Meaning of Progress."" He blogs at http://americanexception.com/ . William Jelani Cobb says Barack Obama's White House has been remarkably silent on same-sex marriage. (CNN) -- Last week Gov. John Lynch signed a bill making New Hampshire the sixth state to legalize same-sex marriage. It was a paradoxical moment. The new law is a reminder that same-sex marriage is the civil rights issue of our era and just how far the movement for marriage equality has come. It also highlighted the unexpected and remarkable silence from the White House on this issue. During the campaign, Barack Obama assured gays and lesbians that he supported repealing ""don't ask, don't tell"" as well as adoption and anti-discrimination rights for the gay community. Those kinds of promises carry a particular weight when made by a man whose very capacity to run for elected office is the yield of another civil rights struggle. That lineage and the high expectations that come with it gave Obama an amazing degree of latitude, allowing him, for instance, to remain relatively unscathed even when he placed the Rev. Rick Warren on the Inauguration Day program. But to date he has taken no significant action on this front and, more critically, his administration is actually being outpaced by state legislatures around the country. Granted Obama has been in office for just 4½ months, but given the developments in Iowa, California and New Hampshire, they have been among the most significant months in the struggle for marriage equality. The administration likely wishes to avoid the culture war debacle of Bill Clinton's early presidency. But gay rights are a national issue in a way they weren't in 1993. Thus the clouds of disappointment we already see gathering. We long ago overdosed on comparisons of Obama and previous presidents, but it's hard to miss the way his administration had begun to echo that of John F. Kennedy. And not in a good way. During the 1960 campaign, Kennedy ran as a forward-looking Democrat who understood the necessity of civil rights. He promised an executive order banning housing discrimination. Gestures like his phone call to a pregnant Coretta Scott King while her husband languished in an Albany jail and Robert Kennedy's judicial arm-twisting to secure his release endeared the young candidate to millions of African-Americans. But once in office, Kennedy made civil rights a low priority. By 1962, Martin Luther King was openly critical of Kennedy and bitterly observed that the movement activists had become ""pawns in a white man's game."" It is worth recalling that the 1963 March on Washington was organized not only to ensure passage of a civil rights bill, but also to ensure that Kennedy would not cave to Southern Democrats on the issue. In retrospect, Kennedy's reputation as a supporter of civil rights was greatly exaggerated. On one occasion, Atlanta Mayor William Hartsfield invoked Kennedy's name -- without his knowledge or approval -- as the reason local politicians were ""forced"" to release Martin Luther King from prison. The plan was to direct the anger of Southern whites at Kennedy rather than the local officeholders who wanted King out of jail, but one side-effect was to raise Kennedy's standing among black voters. In reality, though, as both candidate and president, Kennedy was consistently behind the curve of history. It is far too early to make such assessments of President Obama, but there is a disturbing parallel. He has carefully outlined support for civil unions and his opposition to a Constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. But as a former law professor, Obama certainly knows -- and the language of the recent California ruling makes frighteningly clear -- the logic of civil unions is essentially the logic of ""separate but equal."" (Try reading the California decision and the Plessy v. Ferguson opinion consecutively.) iReport.com: Share your thoughts on same-sex marriage . On the surface, civil unions are a politically safe middle ground, an attempt to highlight the artificial divide between secular unions and the religious rite of marriage. But the fact is that marriage is a civil institution just as much as it is a religious one, and therefore religious objections to same-sex marriage shouldn't be an obstacle. We allow atheists to marry and we do not refer to a wedding performed by a secular judge or justice of the peace as a ""civil union."" The president would do well to define this moment by taking immediate action to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell"" or ensure adoption rights for homosexual, bisexual and transgender families. Kennedy believed that promoting civil rights would jeopardize other aspects of his domestic agenda during a national crisis. Barack Obama has a broader set of crises to resolve than any president in modern history, but that is not a rationale for inaction on this issue. Ultimately, the gay rights movement will have to learn something that the civil rights movement learned again and again during the 20th century -- it is often necessary to force the hand of even your allies to achieve your goals. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Jelani Cobb.","William Jelani Cobb: White House has been largely silent on same-sex marriage .

"The majestic Kongou Falls has some of the most spectacular cataracts in Africa, which are located in the heart of Gabon's Ivindo National Park. The 3,000-square-kilometer park is one of the most significant African sites for biodiversity conservation, sheltering a rich variety of wildlife and vegetation species. It is this scenic beauty and environmental importance of Gabon's vast rainforests that first prompted Gabonese activist and renowned environmentalist Marc Ona Essangui to campaign for the protection and preservation of the Congo Basin rainforest. ""It's fantastic the forest, fantastic,"" says Ona, a winner of the coveted environmental award Goldman Prize for his efforts to save Ivindo from a mining project. ""There is peace, tranquility, one breathes in the freshness -- no pollution and it's magnificent,"" he adds. ""If we destroy this forest, we will have aggression from everywhere that will reach the wider population."" See more: 'Green Gabon' for eco-tourism . The world's second largest rainforest after the Amazon, the Congo Basin rainforest in Central Africa is under constant threat of destruction and exploitation. A large swath of this dense rainforest is located in Gabon -- about 80 per cent of the equatorial country is covered by pristine forests, home to numerous gorillas, elephants, antelopes and tropical birds. In 1998, Ona, a survivor of childhood polio, co-founded Brainforest, a non-governmental organization working to preserve Gabon's natural resources. The wheelchair-bound activist says he is fighting for the rights of his people, the indigenous tribes who call the forest home but have no legal rights over their lands. ""In the beginning, one of the objectives of the Brainforest was about conserving and protecting the Ivindo forest,"" he says. ""But today we have seen that it is also necessary to talk about the laws that govern forestry rights, looking at illegal activities in the forest, such as corruption and all that is related to forestry. We are looking at the rights of those living in the forest and defending and protecting their rights."" Located in the western part of Central Africa, oil-rich Gabon is one of Africa's wealthiest countries -- the land beneath Gabon is richly seamed with minerals and is being mined successfully. In the early 2000s, the Gabonese government entered into an agreement with a Chinese mining and engineering company, offering them a huge mining concession within the Ivindo National Park. According to Brainforest, negotiations were conducted in secret and the government did not consult with affected communities nor assess the project's environmental impact. Ona obtained a leaked copy of the agreement and made it public, applying enormous pressure and forcing the state to renegotiate the terms of the contract. The campaigner's efforts were key in the fight to save the park but Ona has paid a high price for his activism. In 2008, he was arrested and detained for 13 days. He has also been evicted from his home and has been refused an exit visa more than once. More from African Voices: How Ladysmith Black Mambazo inspired Mandela . However, his efforts have given him international acclaim and renown; in 2009 he was awarded the Goldman Prize, a ""Green Nobel"" prize that honors grassroots environmental heroes across the globe. ""It's an honor because it is the equivalent of a Noble Peace prize-- it is recognition of the work we do from the public,"" says Ona. ""When I obtained it and was congratulated for receiving this award, I saw it as appreciation and acknowledgment of the work we have always done and will continue doing to protect the interests of this population and the entire forestry environment,"" he adds. A champion of social justice, Ona has also been fighting tirelessly for the rights of the disabled -- suffering from polio since the age of six, he refuses to let his condition prevent him from living a full life. ""I am married, my wife is able-bodied, I have children who are not handicapped, I do everything normally,"" says Ona, who in 1994 founded an NGO called Handicap sans Frontiers. ""Even if I am disabled, I don't have that mindset -- I see what I can contribute to my community, my family or my country, that for me is the fundamental thing.""

""The message is simple,"" he says, ""we are not going to be blinded by material things as our leaders. The future generations will not benefit from this beautiful nature scene if we don't preserve it and we will be known as a continent where resources can be exploited but not to be nourished and cared for.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's president slammed President Obama on Saturday, saying officials in the Islamic republic are astonished over what they see as his interference in Iran's disputed elections. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad chided President Obama on Saturday for ""meddling"" in Iran. ""Didn't he say that he was after change?"" Ahmadinejad asked Iranian judiciary officials in a speech. ""Why did he interfere? Why did he utter remarks irrespective of norms and decorum?"" His remarks are countering Western criticism of the June 12 elections, which the government said Ahmadinejad won in a landslide. Ahmadinejad spoke a day after Obama discussed the unrest in Iran during a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  Watch an author's take on Iran » . As the Iranian president spoke, Iran's Foreign Ministry slammed the Group of Eight on Saturday for its criticism Friday of the post-election violence. The Group of Eight comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Ahmadinejad's remarks raised the issue of the new dynamics between longtime adversaries Iran and the United States. The Obama administration has made efforts to seek dialogue with the country's regime but has been moved to toughen rhetoric in light of the unrest in Iran. ""They keep saying that they want to hold talks with Iran,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""All right, we have expressed our readiness as well. But is this the correct way? ""Definitely, they have made a mistake. They have revealed their intentions before the Iranian nation, before the world nations. Their mask has been removed. "" Speaking to reporters on Friday, Obama said the violence used against  demonstrators disputing the election results ""is outrageous. And despite the government's efforts to keep the world from bearing witness to that violence, we see it and we condemn it."" He also said it was ""absolutely clear"" that Ahmadinejad's chief rival in the election, Mir Hossein Moussavi, has ""captured the imagination or the spirit of forces within Iran"" and has become a representative of street protesters, who have clashed with security forces. Obama said he and Merkel ""share the belief that what's happened in Iran is unacceptable when it comes to violence against its own citizens.""  Watch how political cartoonists view the situation » . ""I continue to believe that ultimately, it's up to the Iranian people to make decisions about who their leaders are going to be,"" he said Friday. ""But as I said this week and I've said previously, a government that treats its own citizens with that kind of ruthlessness and violence and that cannot deal with peaceful protesters who are trying to have their voices heard in an equally peaceful way I think has moved outside of universal norms, international norms that are important to uphold."" Obama on Friday was asked if he had thoughts about Ahmadinejad's call that he apologize over claims of meddling in the elections or if Ahmadinejad ""should apologize for calling you someone like President Bush."" ""I don't take Mr. Ahmadinejad's statements seriously about apologies, particularly given the fact that the United States has gone out of its way not to interfere with the election process in Iran,"" he said. He also said Ahmadinejad should ""think carefully about the obligations he owes to his own people. And he might want to consider looking at the families of those who've been beaten or shot or detained."" Iran also criticized the Group of Eight foreign ministers for their remarks in Trieste, Italy, in a joint statement. ""We fully respect Iran's sovereignty,"" the joint statement reads, but ""at the same time, we deplore the violence that has erupted in the wake of the election and that has led to the death of Iranian civilians."" The ministers called on the government ""to guarantee respect for the grass-roots will expressed in the ballot box,"" and voiced hope that ""a solution can be found through democratic dialogue."" Iranian media quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi as expressing regret over the ""interventionist and hasty stances"" of the ministers. Iranian officials underscored their position that the turnout was strong and the vote was conducted in a ""competitive and free atmosphere."" Some in Iran have criticized what they say was a denial of visas by the United States to an Iranian delegation intent on attending a U.N. conference about the world economic crisis. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said Saturday that on June 16, Iran requested the return of a delegation's passports without visas.

"To some, Memorial Day marks the start of summer. But to veterans and their families, Memorial Day is one of the most difficult and hallowed days of the year. A time to reflect on our fallen heroes and to think of survivors of wars gone by. Lost, injured or home safe and sound, our military and veterans communities are facing grave challenges that deserve national attention. Yet, as this Memorial Day approaches, stories about Benghazi, the IRS, and the Department of Justice's seizing the phone records of AP and Fox reporters are taking up almost all of the focus in Washington. After the Memorial Day observances conclude and before Washington returns to business as usual, we need to ensure we are doing right by those who have served to protect our nation. On Memorial Day, nearly 900,000 veterans have disability claims pending with the Department of Veteran Affairs, including almost 600,000 veterans who have been waiting for more than 125 days for a response. Those figures represent a more than 613% increase since President Obama's first inauguration in 2009, when 85,000 veterans were in the backlog for more than 125 days. VA benefits were put in place to support service-disabled veterans who, as a result of their injuries, need health care and financial support. But our men and women returning home now aren't getting that support. They're asking for help, but so many are not getting it. There's been some recent movement in the right direction. Since March, the VA  has decreased the backlog by 3.2 percent, according to the IAVA's analysis of Veterans Benefits Affairs reporting. That the backlog has been reduced for six consecutive weeks is a positive development and reflects the VA's new urgency to fix the backlog problem with new initiatives. Yet, to eliminate the backlog by its public goal of 2015, the VA must do far better. Veterans need the aggressive leadership and decisive action of Obama, who has been silent on the backlog,  to bring the backlog down to zero. This is something that 67 senators and a bipartisan group in the House are calling for, along with more than a dozen veterans service organizations. The president rightfully displayed prompt leadership in responding to another critical issue for service members: military sexual trauma. A Pentagon report released in early May revealed that an estimated 26,000 cases of sexual assault occurred last year, a one third increase over the previous year. Additionally, during this past month, three officers responsible for leading sexual assault prevention efforts have been embroiled in sexual misconduct cases themselves. News interactive: 100 faces, 100 hours -- Remembering the fallen . These incidents have served as a wake-up call for all Americans. We can't ask our fellow citizens to put their lives at risk for us if they're not safe themselves. A group of lawmakers, led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, is proposing new legislation to combat this problem. The Military Justice Improvement Act would remove oversight of sexual assault cases from the chain of command and allow victims to report their assaults to an independent prosecutor. This is an important piece of legislation that is quickly gaining bipartisan support and should be implemented immediately. It's sensible and can help change the military's culture for the better. This Memorial Day, we also must continue our work to prevent suicides among those who served. The numbers are sobering: according to Army reporting, 109 active-duty and reserve servicemen and women have taken their own lives this year. Among all veterans, 22 veterans commit suicide every day. That's 22 veterans. Every day. Despite what we know about veterans' suicides, a recent report from the VA inspector general's office found that about a third of veterans considered to be at high risk for suicide don't receive the recommended follow-up care after they've been discharged from VA inpatient mental health care. That is unacceptable. We must continue to push for an expansion of programs that connect veterans to mental health resources while also fighting to erase the stigma that prevents many veterans from seeking mental health care in the first place.  Ensuring that our service members are thoroughly evaluated and properly diagnosed is crucial to ensuring that they'll be able to cope with, and overcome, the physical and mental injuries they may have sustained while serving our country. We need the country to get behind us if we're going to take care of these men and women who have taken such good care of our country. The president's leadership is essential, but he needs a battalion to lead. #GoSilent with veterans this Memorial Day and ask a friend to do the same. Hold hands with your family at 12:01 p.m. ET and teach your kids why you're doing it. Thank the next person you see in uniform. And when Memorial Day is over, join our effort to ensure that our elected officials stand with us and take meaningful steps to support veterans and their families. Honor our men and women who have paid the ultimate sacrifice by doing right by their brothers and sisters among us.","Paul Rieckhoff: Memorial Day most difficult, hallowed day for veterans and their loved ones .

"(CNN) -- Bankers get a bad press. If they are not in news studios trying to defend their annual bonus being more than most people earn in a lifetime, they are attempting to brush off the latest multi-million pound fine they received for ripping off the public. Not so in the latest edition of the Global Talk Finance program. Representatives from the banking sector talk enthusiastically about how they've reformed their risky business practices and raised billions to fight against poverty and climate change. They herald the introduction of a ""Robin Hood"" tax, where speculators pay around a 0.1% tax on their financial transactions, as a ""triumph."" Ok, so it may not strictly be real life. The news anchor is played by ""Walking Dead"" star Andrew Lincoln, he quizzes characters played by some of Europe's biggest stars -- Bill Nighy, Clemence Poesy, Javier Camara and Heike Makatsch who says the tax was ""a profoundly important moment -- it's been good for business and it's brought billions for jobs in Europe."" Yet fiction is not so far away from reality. Eleven European countries, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain are signed up to a Financial Transaction Tax which could raise up to 30 billion pounds annually and be implemented as early as next year. It is the best chance we have of ensuring those responsible for the crisis pay their fair share to put things right. Unfortunately the UK is refusing to join in, even attempting to block the proposal with a groundless legal challenge in the European Courts of Justice. As Bill Nighy's character demonstrates masterfully as he squirms out of questions over how the money could help stop cuts to public services, it means the UK will also lose out on the benefits. Bill Nighy has been involved with the ""Robin Hood"" tax campaign since its inception in 2010. He came with us to see first-hand the impact of the financial crisis only a few miles away from its epicenter in the City of London. A food bank in the London borough of Putney, where emergency food parcels are given out to those in the most dire need, had seen numbers increase 50% in a year. There are now over 350 Trussell Trust food banks across the UK, at one point opening at the rate of one a week, as people struggle to make ends meet in a perfect storm of public service cuts and decreasing standards of living. Yet the devastation wreaked by the crisis rippled out far beyond national borders. Oxfam estimates it left a $65 billion dollar hole in the budgets of the world's poorest countries -- the people least responsible for the crisis are paying the heaviest price. Meanwhile back in the financial sectors of London and New York, bankers were cushioned from impacts of their own actions -- public money bailed them out and continues to subsidize them today. But it's not just about ensuring banks give something back, it's about refocusing our economy away from the fool's gold of financial sector riches. Financial products such as derivatives can be useful for the economy -- they allow a haulage company, for example, to buy a petroleum future, meaning their costs are predictable over time. But all sense of proportion has been lost, the market in derivatives is now a mind-boggling 70 times the size of global GDP. This frenetic swarm of speculative trades may earn a small cabal of the super-rich ever more money, but it brings with it huge risks and when things go wrong, as they did so spectacularly five years, ago billions can be wiped from the real economy. The low rate of the tax would help curb these speculative trades whilst avoiding impacting on people's pensions and savings. As the film's director David Yates, best known for directing the final four films in the Harry Potter series, said: ""I agreed to direct the film because the ""Robin Hood"" tax is a simple yet brilliant idea. We need to learn the lessons of the financial crisis and ensure that banks and hedge funds work in the interests of society not the other way around."" He's not wrong. As France and Germany are due to make an announcement on the tax and countries will agree the details in coming weeks. Let's hope they agree the best possible tax that raises the most money -- it will help create a financial sector we can all be proud of. Read more: U.K. moves to block Europe's Tobin tax .

"He's an 82-year-old ""redneck hillbilly from west North Carolina"" who's been scratching an itch to go fast his whole life. Finally, after decades of racing high-performance speed boats and winning world-class endurance car competitions, Preston Henn got his hands on the fastest executive jet on the planet: the G650. CNN caught up with Henn by cell phone between practice laps at Daytona International Speedway. ""As long as the cars here don't crank up, we can talk!"" he said. From then on, Henn -- Florida's flea market kingpin -- sounded like a giddy schoolboy as he told his story about how he put down a $1 million deposit in April 2012 to become the first person to buy a Gulfstream G650 -- ""the hottest airplane out there"" --- with its distinctive, sweeping, curving wings and its roomy, swanky interior. It made him ""feel like a million dollars,"" he said gleefully. For a plane that costs $65 million, feeling like $1 million might seem like a disappointment. But you get the picture. The jet's top speed: 704 mph -- nearly the speed of sound -- makes it arguably the world's fastest civilian aircraft. ""I was just amazed at how quick it took off,"" says Henn. ""And then it just went ZOOM -- straight up. I just sat back and drank a glass of wine and enjoyed it."" Henn knows speed. He's been around the track a time or two -- winning the checkered flag during the '80s at the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours event at Florida's Sebring International Raceway. He doesn't compete anymore. But he still travels around the world to race his friends. A super-fast G650 that can fly 8,000 statute miles -- farther than just about any other executive class jet -- might save him a lot of time and hassles. Saving time and avoiding hassles are the main reasons the rich and famous want to fly private. Oprah Winfrey and Bill Gates reportedly each own a Bombardier Global Express. Tom Cruise is said to have a Gulfstream IV. Jackie Chan has an Embraer Legacy 650. And Jay-Z reportedly received a Bombardier Challenger 850 from his wife, Beyonce, as a Father's Day gift. But none of these planes can smoke the G650. Speed aside, it's got goodies like no other jet in its class. In the cockpit: an infrared night-vision system projects a pilot windshield display, increasing safety during landings. In the cabin: bigger 28-inch-tall windows and a ceiling height of 6-and-a-half feet. ""if you fly from here to Tokyo, you have to fly with two crews,"" Henn explains. The G650 has ""a complete crew quarters and restrooms and galley and everything they need. So it's a different breed of cat from what I'm used to."" Speed flows through Henn's family bloodline, dating back to his boyhood in Western North Carolina. His father raced speed boats and cars when he wasn't running movie theaters. As an adult in 1963, Henn bought a drive-in theater of his own in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. During the next half-century, that drive-in grew into the Swap Shop -- an 88-acre flea market and cash cow. Of course, Henn's not the lone lover of the G650. Reportedly, the plane has caught Oprah's eye as well. Also said to be interested are Hollywood media mogul David Geffen, designer Ralph Lauren and financial wizard Warren Buffett. Keep in mind that ""very few celebrities own their own jets,"" says Doug Giese of Embraer Executive Jets. Owning a plane is still expensive, even if you're rich. Giese says most celebs fly private by using brokers or buying memberships in fractional share programs. Brokers . New Hampshire-based PJS Private Jet Services Group brokers private jets -- hooking planes up with passengers for a one-time, up-front price. ""Private aviation is becoming more commonplace because there are more programs now,"" says PJS CEO Greg Raiff, a 23-year top broker whose business includes several college and professional sports teams. ""Thanks to the Internet, there are now 500 companies that can arrange something for you."" Typically, an aircraft that can fly about 10 passengers round trip from New York City to Los Angeles could cost about $54,000. A smaller jet that seats about seven might cost $26,000 round trip from Philadelphia to Austin, Texas. Split the cost among the passengers, and it's comparable to the price of some luxury cruises -- and a possible option to celebrate an important life-event such as a golden anniversary or a retirement party. Fractional shares . Fractional share programs such as NetJet have been around for a while, offering travelers the less expensive option of buying shares of a jet instead of buying the whole thing. Share programs often come with ""jet cards."" Prepay tens of thousands of dollars onto your card in exchange for the convenience of dialing an 800 number and ordering a jet. ""That was a real industry game-changer,"" says Raiff. ""It made booking a jet as easy as ordering a pizza."" One downside, says Raiff: You have to pay well in advance. Many jet cards start at a minimum of $100,000, but Delta Private Jets offers a more affordable $25,000 card. Give them at least 48 hours notice, and they'll get you a plane, says DPJ President Cyril Turner. One upside, says Turner: You're protected against rising prices. ""People can lock in today's rate even if there are future increases,"" Turner says. ""With the cost of Jet A fuel approaching $6 a gallon and a burn rate approaching -- depending on the plane type -- 200 gallons an hour, that gets pretty costly."" Delta Private Jets charges about $5,000 per hour for jets seating up to eight people.  Rates start at $9,800 per hour for jets seating up to 14 people. BlackJet offers an even more creative idea: ""semi-private"" flying, CNNMoney reports. BlackJet books business class planes from carriers such as JetSelect and sells the seats individually. A BlackJet seat on a Challenger 300 from New York to L.A. might cost around $3,500. CNNMoney: BlackJet offers private jet seats for less . Development of the G650 survived a crisis in 2011, when one of the jets crashed during a takeoff performance test in New Mexico, killing two Gulfstream pilots and two flight test engineers. Federal investigators blamed Gulfstream's testing process. During the investigation, Gulfstream temporarily shut down its G650 test planes. But 17 months later, the G650 received FAA certification. Now, Gulfstream has more than 200 customers waiting to get their hands on a G650. So far, only about a half dozen have been delivered to customers. As they roll out, plane spotters are on site, snapping photos and posting them online. ""If you call Gulfstream and ask, 'When can I get a G650?' It's four or five years off,"" says Henn. Unfortunately for Henn, enjoying his G650 won't be an option for the time being. Ultimately, he says, he's a businessman, and the plane is an investment. He leased the jet back to Gulfstream so the company can use it as a demonstration model. ""It's on its way to China,"" Henn says. ""It's supposedly going to set a round-the-world record."" There's a hint of disappointment in Henn's voice, above the sounds of revving engines at the Daytona track. ""Sorry, it's time to get back to it,"" he explains. His Enzo Ferrari is beckoning. ""I'm going to take my Enzo back out on the track, and then I'm finished for today,"" he says. ""Then I'm going back to work.""","Aviation fans are excited about the new, super-fast and stylish Gulfstream G650 .

"(CNN)Ahmed has joined Charlie in the social media tributes to victims of the Paris terrorist attack this week. The hashtag #JeSuisCharlie -- ""I am Charlie"" -- became an international rallying point for people expressing solidarity with the victims of the slaughter carried out by gunmen at the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday. But another hashtag, #JeSuisAhmed, has become a poignant way of honoring Ahmed Merabet, a 40-year-old police officer who was killed by the terrorists. During the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo offices, the gunmen claimed that they were avenging the Prophet Mohammed by attacking a magazine that had repeatedly lampooned Islam and other religions. But by killing Merabet, they took the life of a man who was reported to be a Muslim. Like the parents of the two main suspects in the attack, Merabet's mother and father are believed to have moved to Paris from North Africa. 'I died defending his right' ""I am not Charlie, I am Ahmed the dead cop. Charlie ridiculed my faith and culture and I died defending his right to do so,"" wrote the Twitter user Dyab Abou Jahjah. By Friday morning Paris time, his tweet, using the #JeSuisAhmed hashtag, had been retweeted more than 17,000 times. Many more tributes to Merabet poured in on the hashtag. Alongside it, some people tweeted a quote attributed to the French philosopher Voltaire: ""I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."" Others simply said thank you to the fallen officer. 'It was his job, it was his duty' Even before Merabet's name and background became public, many people knew how he died because of a widely circulated video from Wednesday's attack. He was on patrol near the Charlie Hebdo offices when the attackers burst out. ""He was on foot, and came nose to nose with the terrorists. He pulled out his weapon. It was his job, it was his duty,"" Rocco Contento, a police union representative, told the Guardian. The video from the scene shows Merabet twisting in pain on the ground after already being shot once. As the gunmen move toward him, he raises his hands, indicating surrender. French media reported that one of the gunmen asked the wounded officer, ""Do you want to kill us?"" Merabet is heard in the video crying out, ""No! It's OK, boss."" That's when one of the gunmen shoots him at point blank range in the head. Likable, always smiling, colleague says . Contento described Merabet as a quiet, conscientious man -- likable and always smiling. A photo shows him grinning into the camera. He had a girlfriend, according to Contento. Merabet had reportedly been a police officer for eight years, assigned to the 11th arrondissement, where the attack took place. He was working as a bicycle cop, but French newspaper Le Figaro reported that he'd recently qualified to become a detective. Other slain officer was protecting editor . Merabet wasn't the only police officer killed in the attack. The other was Franck Brinsolaro, who had been assigned to protect Stephane ""Charb"" Charbonnier, the editor of Charlie Hebdo, for the past several years, according to Le Figaro. Brinsolaro, 48, was killed inside the magazine's offices with Charbonnier and other cartoonists. Le Figaro reported that the police officer had just got married to a woman with whom he had a 1-year-old daughter. ""The whole of France needs to take action,"" said Brinsolaro's twin brother, Philippe, according to the newspaper. ""You can't attack freedom of expression and the authority of the state like that."" On social media, Franck Brinsolaro, like Ahmed and the staff of Charlie, was also being remembered -- through the hashtag #JeSuisFranck. CNN's Randi Kaye contributed to this report.","Ahmed Merabet is reportedly a Muslim whose parents came from North Africa .

"Gone are the days when all London's high-end dining had to offer was a white tablecloth in a stuffy setting. London's dining room democratization is none more apparent than in the explosion of ""no reservations"" restaurants -- reservations aren't accepted, walk-ins only. Though critics lament the need to stand around for hours waiting for a table, the concept works for those in the city on business who haven't had a chance to secure a seat at one of the city's best eateries. Here are a few of London's best no-reservations restaurants. Spuntino . No-reservation restaurants aren't new to London, but the trend didn't go mainstream until restaurateur Russell Norman opened his first Polpo restaurant in Soho in 2009. Since then, he's had five more openings around London. Our pick of the bunch is Spuntino. This isn't your average London Italian establishment -- Spuntino is more Sinatra than Locatelli. Diners can expect simple dishes done just right, like chickpeas and squid ink, lamb and pickled sliders and chocolate, pecan and whisky cake. The industrial, postmodern ambiance is reminiscent of NYC's Lower East Side. The result is refreshing for a city that, until a few years ago, was in desperate need of a fresh injection of cool. Spuntino, 61 Rupert St., Soho . Bubbledogs . On the one hand, you have a chef who's trained under culinary luminaries such as Marcus Wareing, Thomas Keller and Rene Redzepi. On the other, you have a sommelier whose previous work experience includes serving at global legends Per Se and Noma. Put them together and do you get just another cliched fine dining place? Not a chance. This husband-and-wife team is the rage of London's food scene right now for their Bubbledogs -- a champagne bar serving New York-style gourmet hot dogs. Highlights are the K-Dawg (filled with kimchi, fermented red bean paste and lettuce) and Breakie dogs, made with fried egg, tomato relish and black pudding bits. Bubbledogs, 70 Charlotte St., Fitzrovia; +44 20 7637 7770 . Barrafina . It's said that in Spain's Basque region, everyone can cook well. Whether or not that's true, the cooking of executive chef Nieves Barragan, who comes from a town near Bilbao, is up there with the best of San Sebastian's pintxos bar chefs. This brainchild of brothers Sam and Eddie Hart is like a visit to your favorite Barcelona tapas bar. Since 2007, customers have been queuing up for hours over glasses of wine to eat some of the most iconic dishes in London, including the oozy classic tortilla, octopus with capers and presa Iberica (pork shoulder). Hard-to-find ingredients and long hours of prep are the secrets to the restaurant's success. Don't bother buying their cookbook -- we can assure you it's less painful to wait in line at Barrafina than to try to cook some of its best-loved dishes yourself. Barrafina, 54 Frith St., Soho; +44 20 7813 8016 . Copita . Not as well known as Barrafina, this fellow Soho tapas bar is by no means inferior. Copita, with its Sevillan ambiance, serves slightly modern versions of tapas, but the tastes remain unmistakably Spanish. The menu changes daily, keeping regulars coming back, while favorite items are ever-present. The venison, girolles and truffled mash, and the pork belly bun, courgette and chili, are both recommended. However, the star of the show is the savory ajo blanco and beetroot -- a cold Spanish soup made with garlic and almonds. Copita offers a great selection of Sherry by the glass. Though Copita won't accept bookings for dinner, those who want to guarantee a lunch spot can reserve online. Copita, 26 d'Arblay St., Soho; +44 20 7287 7797 . Pitt Cue Co . Hailed for kick-starting the southern American BBQ trend in London, Pitt Cue Co was born on the streets of South Bank, where its slow cooked, smoky and succulent meats have long been fixture items for 20-something Londoners who work around the area. Led by Tom Adams (ex-Blueprint Café and Ledbury) and his friend, Jamie Berge, the restaurant moved to a new, permanent home in Soho in 2012. Fortunately, the quality hasn't diminished. Highlights include blackened fall-off-the-bone St. Louis ribs and tender pulled pork. Pitt Cue Co, 1 Newburgh St., Soho; +44 20 7287 5578 . Barnyard . Located in the heart of Fitrovia, and the newest restaurant on this list, Barnyard is the brainchild of the young and talented Ollie Dabbous of Michelin-starred Dabbous. The concept is simple: comfort food in an unpretentious setting without having to book six months in advance (which is the case of Dabbous' first venue). Diners get deceptively simple dishes like sausage in a bun with burned onions, or crispy chicken wings with smoked paprika, garlic and lemon. With chef Dabbous at the helm, the flavors are anything but ordinary. Other menu stars include roast suckling pig with gooseberry relish and the not-to-be-missed dessert, popcorn ice cream with smoked fudge sauce. Barnyard, 18 Charlotte St., Fitzrovia; +44 20 7580 3842 .","A growing number of London restaurants are adopting a no-reservations policy, accepting walk-ins only .

"What kind of holiday rental home costs $10,000 a day? Perhaps one set on a private Caribbean beach, with a personal fleet of boats? An Alpine chalet, with postcard-perfect views of the Matterhorn from every window? Or maybe a personal spa, with a lap pool, hiking trails, a state-of-the-art gym -- and an on-call personal trainer to make sure you use them? The answer: yes, yes and yes. For today's new generation of well-heeled travelers -- who are increasingly eschewing hotels for private rental villas -- the bar for luxe hideaways has reached dizzying heights. Departures.com: See more over-the-top villas . For a certain breed of jet-setter, home theaters, Ducasse-worthy kitchens and private bars stocked with top-shelf liquor are all de rigueur; what they're after are award-winning chefs ready to whip up personalized dinner-party menus or on-demand yachts with captains who know the best deep-sea fishing spots. Somewhat ironically, this surge in over-the-topness could be considered a by-product of harder economic times. ""Before the global financial crisis there was a glut of high-end construction,"" explains Brian Sharples, founder of HomeAway, a network of villa rental websites representing 650,000 properties with prices ranging from a few hundred dollars up to $392,000 a week. ""Many owners of luxury properties who were over-leveraged have now turned to rentals as a way to defray ownership costs."" The result is a super competitive market where added extras like sports cars and ski equipment are as common as evening turndown treats in hotels. While many of the world's most opulent villas lure guests with an array of cool toys (and we do mean cool -- how does recording studio equipment once used by John Lennon sound?), others deal in what may be the most coveted holiday-home currency: privacy. Departures.com: Top yoga retreats . Is it any wonder that rock stars and royals duck the paparazzi by hiding out on islands like St. Barth and Mustique (particularly when there are homes like Shogun -- set alone on a cloistered estate and reminiscent of a Japanese imperial palace, koi pond included)? Of course, for those seeking true sanctuary, the right vacation villa is only part of the equation; the right staff is also key. (After all, a Viking stove isn't much use if you're a terrible cook; and 17,000 square feet seems like a lot, when you have to vacuum it yourself.) That's why many top-tier villas come with phalanxes of personnel and also offer private transport -- via luxury car, boat or helicopter -- to zip guests anyplace they desire. But, really, when your home away from home is as outrageously opulent as these villas, why go anywhere else? Nandana, Grand Bahama Island . Sequestered behind ornately carved wooden doors (rescued from a 250-year-old Javanese temple), the 20,000-square-foot Nandana evokes a Balinese teak palace -- with a few exceptions. One is its location, on five private acres of Bahamian beachfront on Grand Bahama's Pine Cay; another is the 120-foot-long infinity pool that anchors five luxurious suites, including one styled like an air-conditioned safari tent. Departures.com: World's top walking cities . Yet another is the fleet of go-go gadgets that comes with the property, including four top-of-the-line Yamaha FX WaveRunners (capable of reaching 70 mph), two golf carts, two Suzuki all terrain vehicles, a customized Land Rover Defender and a deep-sea fishing yacht with a captain. The only downside: You might have to bring your own Learjet for the private airfield. nandanavilla.com . Elisa, Aspen, Colorado . This 17,000-square-foot, six-bedroom mountain lodge has views over the wild snowshoe terrain of Aspen's Red Mountain from nearly every window. There's an entry room with soaring vaulted ceilings, exposed beams, stone walls and a huge welcoming hearth; outside, there's a 60-foot-long infinity pool, hot tub and a colonnaded stone porch with its own massive fireplace -- perfect for evening toddies or marshmallow roasts. Departures.com: A global guide to vacation villas . Ski lift passes and in-house ski and boot fittings are provided. If there's a vintage you can't find in your pre-stocked wine cellar, engage the services of Elisa's personal butler. villazzo.com . Chalet Hike, Zermatt, Switzerland . This five-bedroom ski chalet has possibly the most iconic mountain views in the world; almost every room overlooks the jagged peak of the Matterhorn. Inside, the house has been customized to provide the ultimate in pre-and après-ski comfort. There's the state-of-the-art Brazilian stone and Italian marble kitchen, outfitted with Gaggenau and Miele appliances; a walk-in wine cellar; a sprawling leather De Sede sectional, big enough to sleep three or four extra guests; both bio-fire and natural-log fireplaces; a full gym; boot warmers and a drying room for top-of-the-line ski equipment; and ice-climbing gear, in case you fancy tackling Europe's most iconic peak. Best of all, though, is the quartz and crystal-tiled steam room, which purportedly helps speed healing after a challenging day on the slopes. premiumswitzerland.com . Shogun, Mustique . On an island already famous for its over-the-top exclusivity (Mick Jagger has a holiday home here, and Prince William and Kate Middleton came to celebrate her 30th birthday), the Japanese ryokan-style Shogun, which is 9,000 square feet, stands alone for its outlandish opulence. The house, built on five bucolic cliff-side acres on the western saddle of the island in 1980 -- and newly renovated this year -- is a showcase for Japanese art and antiques, and sports two swimming pools, a private putting green, three vehicles (one Suzuki jeep and two open ""mules"") and a game-fishing powerboat. Each of the nine silk-upholstered, shoji-screened bedrooms is named for a Japanese flower; most look over a 1,000-square-foot central pond, stocked with a small fortune's worth of koi. mustique-island.com . Pezula Private Castle, Knysna, South Africa . A 40-minute ride in a private helicopter brings guests from Cape Town to the 1,500-acre Pezula estate, set along the Garden Route between a three-mile-long stretch of coastline and the Sinclair Nature Reserve.

"(CNN) -- This was a not a normal reserve team fixture for English second-tier club Doncaster Rovers. For a start, a bevvy of teenage girls started arriving ahead of their development squad's clash with Rotherham around midday. And when the teams finally took to the field, a crowd of around 5,000 fans had amassed for a fixture that would usually attract only a handful of diehard supporters. But then, it isn't every day that Louis Tomlinson -- one fifth of the most popular boy band on the planet -- is the star attraction. A mixture of applause and high-pitched screaming greeted the One Direction singer, who signed a deal with his home-town club last August, when he was introduced as a substitute. Try as he might, the 22-year-old couldn't break the deadlock as the match petered out into a goalless draw. ""Just pulling on the shirt is just a boyhood dream,"" he told the club's official website after getting 25 minutes of action in the match that helped support a local charity. ""It's absolutely amazing, those boys get to do that every week and it really is such an honor to be involved in a club, where I spent most of my childhood going down to the games."" One Direction were formed through British talent show X-Factor in 2010 and have broken record after record since -- their success stateside even being compared to that of the Beatles. Tomlinson stars alongside Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Liam Payne in the band, who are managed by music mogul Simon Cowell. They are the only UK band to have had their first two albums reach No.1 in the U.S and have a combined 98 million followers on Twitter. Tomlinson's hectic schedule with the band had prevented him making his debut before now, and he spent a month training with the club before Wednesday's bow. One previous high-profile appearance in an all-star charity match ended prematurely when he was tackled strongly by Gabriel Agbonlahor -- leading to a wave of abuse on social media for the Aston Villa star. ""I had to get fit first, because a few people saw what happened last time when Agbonlahor nobbled me and that was a bit of a mare and I had to try and avoid that,"" Tomlinson added. ""I did alright in the end I think. I think its really important that when we are lucky enough to be in the position that we are in, to use that for the greater good. ""It is really important to spread the word about (children's hospice) Bluebell Wood because they are such a great, great charity."" So could Tomlinson be persuaded to put his pop career on hold in a bid to try and make it full time with Doncaster? When asked if it was easier being a pop star than a footballer he replied: ""Physically it is much easier is being on stage and singing because those boys are proper athletes -- football is harder. ""To get an insight into the football world has been fascinating and to be invited into that is such an honor. ""I have really enjoyed it and I can't thank the people enough at Doncaster Rovers for having me.""","One Direction star Louis Tomlinson makes football debut for Doncaster Rovers .

"(CNN) -- In just the past 19 days, an estimated 63,000 people have been displaced from their homes in Somalia by fighting involving government forces and militias, combined with ""general insecurity,"" the United Nations' refugee agency said Tuesday. Some 14,000 of that number were displaced ""from and within"" Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, in the past two weeks, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees spokeswoman Roberta Russo said in a news release. Fighting in the city on January 13 between government forces and members of the Al-Shabaab and Hisb-ul-Islam militias resulted in the death of at least 10 people, some of them children, she said. In addition, the government-aligned Alu Sunna Wal Jamma militia battled Hisb-ul-Islam fighters around Belet Weyne in central Somalia on January 9, with reports of at least 30 civilians killed and 50 wounded, she said. ""Thousands of people have been forced to flee from their homes and an estimated 11,900 have temporarily settled around Belet Weyne in appalling conditions,"" Russo wrote. There are already another 50,000 internally displaced people in the surrounding Hiraan region, bordering Ethiopia, she said. The refugee agency also estimates that about 28,800 people have been displaced in the area around the town of Dhuusamareeb, in the Galgaduud region in central Somalia, and ""are in urgent need of shelter, water and health care,"" she said. Clashes between Alu Sunna Wal Jamma and Al-Shabaab have flared up again in recent days in the region, Russo said, referring to ""sketchy reports"" of 150 people killed and 80 wounded in the fighting. ""As the struggle for control of the territory continues, insecurity makes it extremely difficult for aid workers to access the area and deliver vital assistance,"" she wrote. She did not specify where the other estimated 8,000 people were displaced from. Somalia continues to be one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, with some 1.5 million internally displaced people and more than 560,000 people living as refugees in neighboring countries, the refugee agency says, mainly in Kenya (309,000), Yemen (163,000) and Ethiopia (59,000).

"Hoylake (CNN) -- Rory McIlroy is one step away from golfing immortality, but it didn't come easily. Perhaps that is the way it should be, given the 25-year-old's two-shot victory at the British Open has elevated him into exalted company. Only two players have completed three legs of a grand slam by that age -- Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods -- a potent pair with 32 majors between them. Sunday's victory at Hoylake means it is only the U.S. Masters that eludes him, a tournament which inflicted such a cruel fate back in 2011. When McIlroy wins majors, he usually wins big. His previous pair -- the U.S. Open in 2011, and the U.S PGA Championship in 2013 -- had both been secured at a canter, eight shots the margin to second best. But not this time. Out in front by six shots at the start of the day McIlroy stumbled round the links, scrapping and clawing away at the course to maintain his advantage. His main challenger wasn't playing partner Rickie Fowler but friend and Ryder Cup comrade Sergio Garcia, of Spain, who charged round the first 10 holes in five-under par. At one stage, McIlroy's lead had been whittled to a mere two shots, but while the Spaniard's nerve wobbled, McIlroy's held. Just. Garcia took two shots to get out of a green side bunker on the 15th and McIlroy made a birdie on the 16th to stretch his lead to three. He could even afford to find a bunker on the last for a par-five to finish on 17-under for the championship. Garcia and Fowler finished tied for second on 15-under. ""There was a better player,"" Garcia said after shooting an impressive 66. ""It's as simple as that."" Perhaps this leg of the hat-trick is the one that will give McIlroy greatest satisfaction, given he had to grind his way to the finish line amid the constant strain of pressure and expectation. His celebration was one that betrayed the relief he felt at getting the job done. Now all that is left is to conquer those demons at Augusta. After being presented with his prize, McIlroy told reporters: ""It feels absolutely incredible. ""I'm happy I gave myself a cushion because there were a lot of guys coming at me especially Sergio and Rickie Fowler. ""Just to be sitting here and looking at this thing and having my name on it, is a great feeling. ""It hasn't sunk in yet and I'm going to enjoy it and let it sink in tonight in the company of my friends and family."" As the 25-year-old himself acknowledged on Saturday, there will be a mountain of hype when he heads to Augusta next April, but for now it is all about McIlroy's transformation on the links. His British Open career was locked in reverse -- finishes of 25 and 60 were followed by a missed cut at Muirfield last year -- but all it took to arrest the decline was a spell of intense practice back at the place he learned the game. He told CNN prior to the tournament he had been honing his game on the links courses of his native Northern Ireland in preparation for an assault on golf's oldest major. Whatever he did worked. Two opening rounds of 66 were followed by a 68 on Saturday when a scintillating salvo -- two eagles in his closing three holes -- had broken the back of the field and opened up a six-shot lead. Unless one of those within clawing distance could tear up the course and induce panic, McIlroy could cruise home on the banks of the Wirral Peninsula. It turns out, pretty much everyone did. His Sunday score was the worst of the top 13 finishers. While Fowler never managed to get within striking distance -- three late birdies helping him clamber back into joint-second -- Garcia ensured the threat of McIlroy running aground remained constant. Both birdied the opening hole as thunderous applause followed them down the first, ten minutes apart. But then McIlroy stumbled. Bogeys on five and six opened the door, and from the galleries following the group up ahead cheers were thick and frequent. Garcia, a long-standing crowd favorite, had three birdies to his name as he strolled off the fifth green, and the deficit stood at three. When McIlroy's approach from the rough at seven pitched on the brow of the bunker and dropped back into the sand, a heavy groan from the gallery told its own story. He recovered to make his par then sunk a birdie chance at nine to balance his nerves. Trouble was, a monstrous roar up ahead signaled a Garcia eagle on 10, and the clutch of Spaniards who had made the trip started to believe. Two fierce blows offered McIlroy the chance to hit straight back, and he duly did. By this stage Hoylake crackled with tension, as those following the final two groups relayed information to those around them while listening intently to their radios. A sea of Irish voices that had made their way across the narrow strait between the Emerald Isle and Merseyside became a little more desperate in their pleas. McIlroy offered further encouragement with a dropped stroke at 14 but a run of four consecutive pars, albeit on a tricky stretch of the course, frustrated Garcia -- still searching for his first major at the 63rd time of asking. His hopes expired on the par three 15th as he found a bunker and took two to emerge. McIlroy, watching from the tee, could breathe a little easier. Garcia duly birdied the par five 16th, little more than a gimme with a helpful wind blowing off the Dee Estuary, but McIlroy answered straight back with one of his own. By that stage the questions marks were slowly evaporating. A par back into the wind on the 17th was secured with a delicate chip from right of the green and though Garcia duly made birdie on the final hole, McIlroy knew the Open was all but his. Despite firing his approach on 18 into the bunker, he duly carved out his ball and rolled his birdie putt close, tapping in as some 7,000 people surrounding the green hailed their champion. It was the final shot of a day marked by more low scoring, with 64-year-old American Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson shooting a four-under 68 to finish one one-over. By contrast, former world number one Tiger Woods closed the tournament on six-over-par and in 69th, his worst ever finish at the oldest major.","Rory McIlroy wins British Open at Hoylake .

"(CNN) -- NATO's leader confidently proclaimed on Sunday that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's days are numbered, but he couldn't foresee how long the alliance's grinding mission to protect besieged civilians will last. ""The game is over for Gadhafi,"" NATO's Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""He should realize sooner rather than later that there's no future for him or his regime."" NATO's Anders Fogh Rasmussen on the endgame in Libya . Rasmussen, a former Danish prime minister, believes Gadhafi will be ushered out of power amid the ""wind of change"" sweeping across North Africa and the Middle East, and the dramatic military strides in Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""This week we have seen a major blow to al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden's evil vision of conflict as a means to create conflict between the Muslim world and the rest of the world. And in Afghanistan, the Taliban is under pressure everywhere, so basically I am very optimistic,"" he said, making reference to the killing of bin Laden by U.S. Navy SEALs on Monday in Pakistan. The alliance has been carrying out a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for the protection of civilians from the Gadhafi regime by any means necessary, and since March 31, its planes have been pounding targets across the country. According to NATO's latest daily operational update, NATO planes struck several targets on Sunday, including an ammunition storage site in the Zintan region, tanks in Misrata and Ajdabiya, military vehicles in al-Brega, and headquarters compound buildings and ammunition and vehicle storage facilities in Hun, south of Sirte. There have been widespread assumptions among experts that the conflict between pro- and anti-Gadhafi forces will continue to be a stalemate for some time. Rasmussen was asked when the NATO operation would be completed but all he could say was ""it needs an end of the mission."" ""We have defined three very clear military objectives,"" he said. ""Firstly, a complete end to all attacks against civilians. Secondly, a free and unhindered and immediate access for humanitarian assistance. And thirdly, a withdrawal of Gadhafi military forces and paramilitary forces to their bases and barracks. When these objectives are fulfilled, our mission is accomplished."" He said ""it's hard to imagine"" that the ""outrageous and systematic attacks"" by pro-Gadhafi forces against Libyans will halt as along as Gadhafi stays in power. He said there needs to be a political and not a military solution with a ""peaceful transition to democracy"" as Gadhafi leaves power. But the conflict rages on. The Tunisian state news-agency reported on Sunday that 50 people were injured when government forces and rebels clashed near the Tunisian-Libyan border on Saturday. Gadhafi's forces on Saturday bombed key fuel depots in the besieged city of Misrata, destroying six containers and causing a massive fire, a rebel spokesman said. Meanwhile, in the de facto rebel capital, Benghazi, the Libyan opposition said Saturday that Italy has agreed to arm the rebels. Abdul Hafiz Ghoga, deputy chairman of the National Transitional Council, said opposition representatives have flown to Italy to finish the deal. The Italian Foreign Ministry categorically denied it will send weapons to Libya. A press office spokesman said Italy will only go as far as sending non-lethal weapons such as satellite and radar systems to aid the rebels. The rebels, intent on winning on the ground without foreign troops, have been asking for arms supplies as the war rages in cities like Misrata.","Rasmussen cites the 'wind of change' in the Arab world .

"The world finally knows how to address the latest addition to the British royal family: HRH Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge. The baby boy is third in line to the throne, after grandfather Prince Charles and father Prince William. Here's some of the history behind the young prince's three names: . Royal Baby: What's next? George . ""George"" -- the front-runner before the announcement, according to many UK bookmakers -- was the name of Queen Elizabeth's father, King George VI, who reigned from 1936 until his death in 1952. He assumed the throne on the abdication of his brother, Edward VIII. His life was depicted in the Oscar-winning movie ""The King's Speech."" George I, born in Germany, became king in 1714. He was followed by a line of kings with the same name, including George III, who was known for his bouts of insanity. The name is also a patriotic choice for many in the UK: Saint George, patron saint of England, is known for his legendary defeat of a dragon in the third century. His feast day is celebrated on April 23, (the date also associated with the birth of William Shakespeare, England's most revered writer). Despite its royal connections, George has humble origins, derived as it is from the Greek name ""georgios"" meaning ""earth worker"" or ""farmer."" Other historical Georges: composer George Frideric Handel (1685-1759), first president of the United States George Washington (1732-1799), and the Pacific explorer George Vancouver (1757-1798). Authors Mary Anne Evans and Eric Arthur Blair also chose George as their pen names: George Eliot (1819-1880) and George Orwell (1903-1950) respectively. Alexander . This gallant title means ""defender of men,"" from the Latin form of the Greek name ""Alexandros."" Alexander III of Macedon (356-323 B.C.), better known as Alexander the Great, courageously ruled and conquered many parts of the world before his untimely death at age 32. The name ""Alexander"" is a feature of the Dutch royal family: Willem-Alexander ascended to the throne after the abdication of his mother Queen Beatrix earlier this year. Other historical Alexanders: English poet Alexander Pope (1688-1744), American statesman Alexander Hamilton (1755-1804), Scottish-Canadian explorer Alexander MacKenzie (1764-1820), Russian poet Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837) and Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922), the Scottish-born inventor of the telephone. Louis . The name ""Louis"" originates from the English and French interpretations of the German name Ludwig, which can be interpreted as ""renowned warrior."" Louis was the first name of Lord Mountbatten, uncle of George's great-grandfather Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and mentor to Prince Charles. He was killed by the IRA while holidaying in  Ireland in 1979. No British monarch has been named Louis, but it is very popular across the English Channel in France, where 18 kings have taken the name from 814 onward. Louis XIV, the Sun King, reigned from 1643 until 1715 and was hailed by many as the greatest monarch of his age because of the growth in French power and the opulence of his court, which included the Palace of Versailles. Louis XVI was the king of France from 1774 until 1792, when he was found guilty of treason after the revolution and executed in 1793. Other historical figures named Louis: French scientist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895); Métis leader Louis Riel (1844-1885), who led a rebellion against Canada; and Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894), who wrote ""Treasure Island"" and ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.""

"(CNN) -- The national debt is bad for the military, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen is telling business men and women and others on a three-day ""Conversations with the Country"" tour across the Midwest. Mullen's trip, which ends Friday in Cleveland, Ohio, is aimed at encouraging business owners to hire veterans. ""The most significant threat to our national security is our debt,"" he told CNN Wednesday. ""And the reason I say that is because the ability for our country to resource our military -- and I have a pretty good feeling and understanding about what our national security requirements are -- is going to be directly proportional -- over time, not next year or the year after, but over time -- to help our economy. ""That's why it's so important that the economy move in the right direction, because the strength and the support and the resources that our military uses are directly related to the health of our economy over time."" The wars on Iraq and Afghanistan have contributed to a more than doubling of the Pentagon budget, which has jumped from $300 billion to $664 billion since 2000. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has called on his department to find $100 billion in overhead savings over the next five years. Speaking Thursday to the Economy Club in Detroit, Michigan, Mullen agreed that the Pentagon needs to ""cut the fat."" ""We're not a business,"" he said in Detroit. ""Part of us does this really well. Parts of us have never had to, plus our budget has doubled over the last 10 years."" The admiral said the Pentagon has not been as proactive as it should have been in prioritizing spending and said the department must adopt responsible fiscal practices. ""A lot of those skills have to be sharpened,"" Mullen said. Both industry and the military need to hone those skills, he said, to avoid ""this wave of debt."" ""It's the responsibility of both sides,"" he said. ""We have to gird ourselves for some pretty significant challenges, given the national security challenges that we have as well as the responsibility to steward every dollar that we have."" Mullen has been telling his audiences that interest on the debt will nearly equal the defense budget in two years, but Congressional Budget Office numbers, in a report released in January, show the interest payment approaching the Pentagon's 2000 budget in 2012 and reaching its 2010 budget in 2019.","Joint chiefs of staff chairman says debt competes with military spending .

"(CNN) -- When Karl-Heinz Rummenigge speaks, you listen. And his advice, if you want to be the best club in the world, is: Never, ever sell your best players. ""I believe a very important point in our history came in 2008,"" Rummenigge, a legend in German football and executive board chairman of the all-conquering Bayern Munich, told CNN. ""We received big offers from England and Spain for the transfer of Franck Ribery to big clubs and we decided not to accept,"" added the 58-year-old, referring to an official bid from Chelsea and an inquiry from Real Madrid for the player who had cost Bayern $40 million in 2007. ""That was very important. I believe because from that point onwards all clubs in Europe understood that Bayern Munich was not a selling club. It's a buying club and that's it."" Rummenigge is all too conscious that it could have been so very different for his beloved Bayern, where he spent the first decade of his senior playing career and won numerous honors. Back in 2004, the Bavarians finished second in the German Bundesliga behind Werder Bremen and were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League in the last-16 by Real Madrid. Not since 2001 had Bayern lifted Europe's most coveted trophy, as teams from the English Premier League, Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga dominated. For a club that enjoyed such glorious years in European Cup football between 1974-76, winning the title on three consecutive occasions, the prospect of being left behind by the continent's elite was frightening. Rummenigge -- who played in the 1976 success and was an unused substitute in the previous year's final -- was all too aware of Bayern's precarious position. It wasn't just the interest other more avaricious clubs had in Bayern's leading players; the new money flooding into European football also potentially threatened the Germans' status. ""About 10 years ago I thought we had no chance when gentlemen from Russia and from the Arab countries came into the business,"" said Rummenigge, referring to the various takeovers of major European clubs by Middle East groups and also Roman Abramovich's investment in England's Chelsea. ""Then we found a very good philosophy at the club -- being a bit patient, and buying good players. ""The story began in 2007 when we bought Ribery, Luca Toni ... and we continue this story to today."" A buying club indeed -- Bayern has become a European power to rival Barcelona and Real Madrid by attracting some of the world's top players. That it is able to do so owes much to the commercial model Rummenigge has created along with club president Uli Hoeness. Helped by the presence of so many of its great players on the board, Bayern is a club which understands not just what happens on the pitch, but off it too. According to the Deloitte money report, Bayern is the third richest club in the world, with its revenue growing by 17% over the past year to $592 million. It is the first time in 11 years that Bayern has been in the top three of the Money League and comes following a Champions League triumph from which it gained a 31% increase in broadcast revenue. Its average home attendances of 71,000 led to matchday revenue of $4.6 million -- more than any other Bundesliga club and less than only four others in Europe. Commercial revenue, merchandise, sponsorship and advertising have all increased markedly, while deals with partners have also boosted the coffers. Extensions to deals with Coca-Cola and Lufthansa, on top of the club's longstanding partnerships with Adidas and Allianz, which holds the naming rights to the stadium, have put Bayern miles ahead of its domestic rivals. That is part of the reason why it has been able to raid the likes of Borussia Dortmund for talents such as Mario Gotze, who joined at the start of this season, and Robert Lewandowski, who will arrive in Munich when it finishes. ""That is not our will,"" Rummenigge says when asked about poaching from rival clubs. ""Our will is where you find the best players in the German Bundesliga. In England it's not different that the big clubs like Chelsea, Manchester United are interested especially in players from Arsenal, from Liverpool and so on. I believe that is the normality of the business."" Such is the talent at Bayern that Pep Guardiola, who took over from treble-winning coach Jupp Heynckes at the end of last season, was able to name Germany internationals such as Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller as substitutes for last week's 2-0 win at Arsenal in the Champions League. Already 19 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga, unbeaten in 47 league games, Bayern looks set to win a record 24th championship without much hassle. Sunday's 4-0 victory over Hannover -- its 14th successive league win -- means only an absolute disaster can prevent Bayern from coasting to a successful title defense, making Dortmund's two-season reign seem long ago. Even more impressive is that Bayern's fans can enjoy this success while paying prices which English Premier League counterparts could only dream of. Bayern's 225,000 members hold an 82% share of the club, and Rumenigge has made football accessible to all supporters with some season tickets available for just over $200. Indeed, the low-cost deals offered by all Bundesliga teams are the envy of many within the European game. Bayern, the 2013 Club World Cup champion, is seeking to extend its dominance and will reportedly open the club's first overseas office in New York from April 1 to help break into the North American market. Guardiola's team will begin a U.S. tour in late July, including a match against the Major League Soccer All-Star lineup. Under the guidance of the Spaniard, the possibilities appear endless for Bayern -- a heavy favorite to become the first team to retain the European title since the advent of the Champions League in 1992. It makes Bayern's acquisition of the former Barcelona coach even more frightening for those who are trying to compete within the same sphere. ""From the very first meeting, I had a feeling that he was something special,"" Rummenigge said of Guardiola. ""He's different. Obsessed by football in a very, very nice and good way. When I talked to our players six months ago they said this guy doesn't stop our success story. This guy brings us ahead."" If they move any further ahead, then the others will only look on with fear.","Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge opens up to CNN .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- A Thai appeals court ruled Friday that suspected international arms dealer Viktor Bout can be extradited to the United States. The court ruled that the extradition process must be completed within three months, otherwise Bout will be released. Bout was shackled in chains during Friday's hearing. His wife and daughter were also in the courtroom. After the ruling, they stood up and cried. Bout has been indicted by U.S. federal authorities on a series of charges, including counts of illegally purchasing U.S. cargo planes to ferry weapons to warring parties and regimes in Africa and the Middle East. In February, a federal indictment charged Bout and an alleged co-conspirator with the illegal purchase of a Boeing 727 and a Boeing 737, money laundering and wire fraud. Thai courts had previously balked at extraditing Bout to the United States on the basis of the original charges against him, which centered on his alleged efforts to send millions of dollars worth of weapons to arm guerrilla fighters in Colombia. Bout was arrested in Bangkok in March 2008 after a dramatic sting operation led by agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, posing as members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Widely regarded as a prolific arms dealer, Bout, has been in Thai custody since. Bout has repeatedly said he has not broken any laws and the allegations against him are lies. He is accused of supplying weapons to war zones around the world -- from Sierra Leone to Afghanistan. The United States charged Bout in 2008 with agreeing to sell surface-to-air missiles, armor-piercing rocket launchers, ""ultralight"" airplanes, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other weapons to FARC. Justice Department officials have sought his extradition since then. Federal authorities accused Bout of four terrorism offenses: conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals, conspiracy to kill U.S. officers or employees, conspiracy to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile, and conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, the designation given to FARC by the U.S. State Department. A former Soviet air force officer who speaks six languages, Bout allegedly began building his arms business as the Soviet Union disintegrated in the early 1990s. He acquired surplus Soviet planes and, according to the U.S. Treasury Department, started shipping arms and ammunition to various conflict zones. It is widely believed that he inspired the character of Yuri Orlov, the arms dealer played by Nicholas Cage in the 2005 film ""Lord of War."" Journalist James Hookway contributed to this report.","Viktor Bout is charged with conspiracy to sell weapons to guerrilla fighters, money laundering and wire fraud .

He said no one was injured during the attack, as the drivers escaped before the trucks were set ablaze. ""Roaring flames of fire can be seen from quite far away,"" he said. Ahmed said the tankers were bound for Afghanistan, which is landlocked and relies heavily on Pakistani ports for imported goods. Attacks on fuel trucks have become common in Pakistan as assailants try to cut off supplies to NATO forces in Afghanistan and try to block the fuel supply for purported U.S. drones that allegedly target suspected militants in northwest Pakistan. The most recent attack came two days after assailants torched two tankers and killed a driver in another part of Balochistan.","Three Afghanistan-bound fuel trucks are torched, police say.

Take the group's leader, Miguel Angel Treviño Morales, aka ""El 40"" or ""Z-40,"" who was taken into custody this week during a Marine operation south of his hometown of Nuevo Laredo. Treviño had a reputation for punishing his foes with ""guisos,"" Spanish for ""cookouts"" and the term used for burning someone alive. With the Zetas, it isn't about murder or torture. It's about making a statement. That statement resounds so effectively that non-Zetas, members of other cartels, dress like the group and claim to be them simply to instill fear. ""Los Zetas is a powerful brand,"" Hope said. ""It is identified with extreme violence. It is identified with a complete absence of scruples."" Though Los Zetas have long been known for their violence, especially after their suspected 2010 massacre of 72 migrants who refused to mule their drugs, two incidents got the attention of U.S. and Mexican authorities, Hope said. For cartels, business as usual in small-town USA . In February 2011, two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were ambushed in the state of San Luis Potosi. Agent Jaime Zapata was fatally shot. About six months later, several men -- thought to be Los Zetas' extortion enforcers -- torched the Casino Royale in Monterrey, killing 52 people. ""There are many types of drug trafficking,"" Hope said. ""This one is particularly toxic."" George Grayson, a professor of government at the College of William & Mary and co-author of ""The Executioner's Men,"" which focuses on Los Zetas, said in an e-mail that while U.S. and Mexican authorities have zeroed in on Los Zetas, other factors have helped fracture the group. Among them is Los Zetas' massive expenditures on weaponry to defend their turf. ""Over the years, Los Zetas have evolved from a vertical organization with effective command-and-control mechanisms to McDonald's-like franchises,"" Grayson said, explaining that as Los Zetas' leadership has been eviscerated, the group has relied on groups of ""green-as-grass newcomers"" who lack the operational savvy of the original Los Zetas. As have the authorities, the Sinaloa, Gulf and Knights Templar cartels have all turned their attention to taking down the group, and Los Zetas have chosen weak allies in the Beltran-Leyva Organization and Juarez Cartel, Grayson said. The group also lost a key military strategist in Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, who was killed by Mexican Marines last year, he said. Former operatives have turned informant, Grayson said, and Lazcano's ally, Ivan ""El Taliban"" Velazquez Caballero (now imprisoned in Mexico), has accused Trevino of ""betraying his comrades in order to get better treatment for his family members captured in the United States."" Hope said many of the top- and second-tier leaders have been killed or arrested, also assisting in Los Zetas' fragmentation. Los Zetas got their start as enforcers for one of Mexico's oldest drug trafficking groups, the Gulf Cartel, which traces its roots to the 1930s, said University of Texas-El Paso anthropology professor Howard Campbell, who has written extensively on drug trafficking. The cartel was in disarray until the 1990s, when Osiel Cardenas Guillen, now imprisoned in the United States, ""made the Gulf Cartel really super-powerful again, bringing huge loads of cocaine and other drugs into the U.S.,"" Campbell said. By the late 1990s, Cardenas found himself at the cartel's helm. ""One of the most innovative tactics he used was co-opting a lot of highly trained military people. He was the first to openly recruit a SWAT-like enforcement wing,"" Campbell said. ""(Cartels) were violent before, but then all of a sudden you have this trained paramilitary wing."" Massacres ensued. Killings were posted on the Internet. Leaving bodies and body parts in public places was a hallmark of Los Zetas' work, as was torture, especially dismemberment. Or as Campbell put it, ""chopping up bodies as you would meat in a butcher shop."" Theories abound about what led to the rift between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, but several years ago -- Campbell estimates it was about 2008 -- Los Zetas broke off, ""unleashing a tremendous wave of violence all over Northeast Mexico."" Where other cartels, including the rival Sinaloa Cartel, took part in a ""patronage network,"" paying police and government officials for their assistance in illicit enterprise, Los Zetas preferred brutal takedowns of entire towns and regions, Campbell said. ""(Los Zetas) therefore became public enemy No. 1 in Mexico,"" he said. They didn't stick solely to drug trafficking, either. Their criminal resume includes extorting business for ""protection fees,"" charging other cartels for passing through their extensive territory, gun and human smuggling, kidnapping and money laundering. ""Violence was a key tool for these guys to obtain all kinds of streams of income,"" Hope said. Their turf includes the lucrative drug plaza of Nuevo Laredo and southern Tamaulipas, Piedras Negras, Tuxpan, Coatzacoalcos, La Huasteca San Luis Potosi, Zacatecas and parts of Sinaloa, Tabasco and Nuevo Leon states, Grayson said. With Treviño's capture, several scenarios could enfold. His brother could take over, but Campbell, Hope and the geopolitical intelligence firm, Stratfor, all question whether he has the respect or capabilities to head a national criminal outfit. ""I wouldn't bet on that,"" Hope said. More violent prospects include the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels attacking Los Zetas in Northern Mexico in a bid to control Nuevo Laredo, ""the crown jewel for cross-border flows for goods, services, guns, money, drugs and illegal aliens,"" Grayson said. Also, the professor postulated the Gulf Cartel could move to take over the Matamoros and Reynosa border crossings. Another possibility is that the small gangs helping to fill out Los Zetas' ranks could begin operating independently or be absorbed by other cartels, several experts said. This would be similar to what happened after Colombia broke up the Medellin and Cali cartels. "" 'Cartelitos' emerged that were violent and successful in shipping cocaine, but did not pose a threat to the nation-state,"" Grayson said. Whatever happens, don't expect much impact on the U.S. side of the border, said author Charles Bowden, whose books on the Mexican drug war include ""Murder City: Ciudad Juarez and the Global Economy's New Killing Fields."" ""His arrest means nothing,"" Bowden said. ""None of the arrests under (former President Felipe) Calderon affected the shipment of drugs to the U.S. or the price of drugs in the U.S."" Added Hope, ""To affect the volume of drugs going into the U.S., there needs to be a reduction in the demand for drugs in the U.S.""","Arrest could mean death knell for Los Zetas, ex-intelligence executive says .

"An ocean at least as large as Lake Superior lies below a thick layer of ice on a moon of Saturn, new data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft suggests. The results, published in the journal Science, support earlier signs that this small moon has liquid water. That means Saturn's sixth-largest moon could have been -- or could now be -- hospitable to life. This discovery puts Enceladus in an exclusive club of extraterrestrial worlds in the solar system that appear to have a subsurface water ocean. The others are Titan, another moon of Saturn, and Europa, a moon of Jupiter. Callisto and Ganymede, also moons of Jupiter, may also have oceans under ice. ""As far as whether one should go first to Europa or Enceladus, I look at this as a kind of a cornucopia of habitable environments in the outer solar system,"" study co-author Jonathan Lunine of Cornell University said in a press conference Wednesday. What we think is there . The north pole of Enceladus has a thickness of ice around 30 miles, with solid rock beneath it. But at the south pole, there may be only 18 to 24 miles of ice covering a subsurface ocean that itself is 5 to 10 miles deep. This ocean appears to be a ""lens-shaped reservoir"" that's deepest at the south pole and thinner further afield. The ocean appears to sit on top of a rocky core and ""may extend halfway or more towards the equator in every direction,"" said study co-author David Stevenson, professor of planetary science at California Institute of Technology, in a press conference. Also noteworthy is that the north pole is heavily cratered, while the ice on the south pole is smoother, meaning it has been resurfaced and softened. Measurements from the new study and previous Cassini data suggest the moon's south pole has an ice layer on top of water on top of silicate rock. If that's true, water circulating through the rock would pick up elements such as phosphorous, sulfur, potassium and sodium into the liquid. These elements are essential for making molecules that life needs, Lunine said. With respect to the ocean being on top of rock, the gravity data from Enceladus ""makes the base of the ocean very much like the base of our own ocean on the Earth,"" Lunine said at the press conference. Enceladus is a small moon, with a diameter of only about 310 miles. In 2005, Cassini found that fractures called ""tiger stripes"" in the south polar region emit water vapor jets rich in salt, lead author Luciano Iess of Sapienza Università di Roma in Rome, Italy, said in a press conference Wednesday. Cassini has also detected organic molecules, which can come from biological or nonbiological sources, near the tiger stripes and in dust grains in the region. A moon of Saturn may have 'tropical' lakes . How do we know? No one has actually gone to Enceladus and seen this ocean under the thick ice layer. But scientists have strong evidence that it is there, based on gravity measurements made with Cassini. When the spacecraft flies by Enceladus, the gravity of the moon changes the probe's speed. Scientists can measure those changes back on Earth by detecting fluctuations in the frequency of the signal that Cassini sends back. If the spacecraft's speed doesn't change, the frequency would remain the same. But depending on where Cassini flies, the frequency of the signal changes in particular ways. This allows scientists to learn more about the moon's subsurface features. Scientists had already known about the presence of a depression or ""dimple"" at the south pole of Enceladus, ""as if there is some amount of, effectively, missing material,"" Lunine said. But in this new study, the change in gravity associated with the depression was not as dramatic as expected. ""There must be some higher density layer that's underneath the ice, and that has to be a liquid water ocean, because there's really nothing else plausible that can explain that offset to what we would expect for the gravity signature of this depression,"" he said. It is possible that this ocean has been sending out the plumes that Cassini first observed in 2005, but this has not been verified. How can we look for signs of life there? Sending a probe to Enceladus with a drill wouldn't be entirely practical because the liquid water is so far under the ice that it would be hard to access, Lunine said. Instead, a spacecraft with instruments more sophisticated than Cassini could fly through the plumes of material being ejected from fractures in the ice. Cassini has already detected the water vapor and organic molecules in these plumes, using a device called a mass spectrometer. But a more advanced, more sensitive version of the same instrument could better test for the ""menu of molecules"" associated with an advanced biological system, Lunine said. Detecting these molecules could be ""the smoking gun for whether in fact there is life down there or not,"" he said.","Enceladus is a small moon of Saturn .
New data suggest a subsurface ocean under its south pole .
Gravity experiment inferred that there must be liquid water there .
Miles of ice likely cover a subsurface ocean that itself is 5 to 10 miles deep ."
"(CNN)Achong is struggling to push our longboat against the current of Borneo's Batang Ai River, so we jump into the water to help him. ""Stay in the boat,"" he pleads, but we ignore him. It's dry season and every ounce of weight is a factor as the longboat's hull scrapes the bottom of the shallow waterway. This is the only time we ignore Achong. Like other tattoo-covered Iban tribesman, he's a master boatman and this is his territory. The Iban, once fearsome headhunters, are also expert trackers who have turned their talents to trailing one of the world's most fascinating endangered creatures: orangutans. The ape pursuit takes us to Sri Aman Division, a remote area of Sarawak that nudges the border of Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of Borneo. Borneo and neighboring Sumatra island are the only places the shaggy-haired red ape survives. The chances of seeing them in the wild are increasingly slim. ""There's no guarantee,"" warns Borneo Adventure in its publicity blurb for the Red Ape Trail, the safari that has brought us deep into the Asian island's dense, steamy jungle. ""Ape numbers are about 20,000 and constantly declining due to forestry, palm oil crops and poaching."" Far more certain is searing heat, humidity of 80-100%, slippery conditions and the possibility of leeches. ""This walk demands a great deal of physical and mental exertion,"" says Philip Yong, Borneo Adventure's co-founder. ""The region is totally isolated from the outside world."" Pampering base . Fortunately there's a soft option -- surprisingly, it involves a longhouse. Longhouses are the large jungle huts that generations of Iban and other Dayak tribes have called home. Usually built on stilts, they're dark, communal living spaces often shared by several families. The Hilton Batang Ai Longhouse Resort in the Sarawak region of Malaysia's portion of Borneo island takes its inspiration from traditional local homes, and translates this into luxury accommodation. Seen from its jetty on the Batang Ai, a massive man-made reservoir in the Sri Aman region, the Hilton-managed resort appears like any other longhouse in the area. Built from large chunks of belian (ironwood), it sits amid swirls of mist on the edges of the reservoir. A huddle of pastel pink and blue painted longboats are tethered to its moorings. This will be our pre-and-post-punishment pampering base. Here we can cool off in a swimming pool -- safely out of leech reach -- and escape the melting humidity in air conditioned suites. The next morning, we head upriver. Deep in the tropical forests, we get a taste of life among the local Iban communities that have lived here, reputedly, since the 17th century. Along the Batang Ai and its tributaries, colorful longhouse settlements unfurl like streamers on the riverbanks. Rice paddies cloak surrounding hillsides in velvet green crops. ""As shifting cultivators, they always built their homes near navigable rivers,"" says our guide, Mashour. ""They were designed to last as long as their exploitation of rice farming in the area, before they moved on to new pastures."" Tattooed bodies . Some traditional Iban dwellings are big enough to house 20 families he adds. They're about 200 feet long. Most are old ramshackle structures. While some Iban now live in new cement longhouses that have a generator-powered TV set or fridge, most stick to old customs. With one major exception. The Iban's name was once synonymous with headhunting -- tribes often saved the severed heads of their human victims as trophies. The tattoos swathing their bodies bragged of their triumphs. Headhunting was largely extinguished by the British colonial regime in Sarawak in the early 20th century. It made a brief comeback during World War II when the heads of 1,500 occupying Japanese forces were paranged with glee. (Parangs are machetes, swords and other blades used across the Malay archipelago.) Heads were mounted like trophies in Iban homes. The Iban have since lent their hunting skills to less grisly pursuits. In 2002, Iban trackers helped map out the Red Ape Trail for Borneo Adventure. The trek got the backing of the UK's Orangutan Foundation for its noteworthy conservation efforts. Today, a safari with the Iban offers one of the best chances of encountering the apes in their natural environment. Fleeting glimpses . After traveling up the Delok River to Borneo Adventure's Nanga Sumpa lodge, we head out in search of orangutan. The Red Ape Trail traces old Iban hunting tracks -- used for hunting heads as well as animals. On the four-hour walk to Genting Tunu, we stop midway for lunch by the river. Our guides, Apau and Nam, dip nimbly into the surrounding forest where, in contrast to their bloodthirsty ancestors, they use their parangs for chopping foraged bamboo shoots and edible ferns. Nam stuffs bamboo logs with the jungle greens, chicken and rice and smokes them on a riverside fire. Later, after an exhausting day of trekking through the jungle, we return to our base camp at the Hilton longhouse. At the wood paneled Nanga Mepi restaurant, we're not so far from authentic Iban life. Lapping up the lake nightlights, we eat local fish and sago puddings, more bamboo chicken and stir-fried jungle ferns. Our encounters with the ape have been fleeting: glimpses of the world's largest arboreal animal crashing through the trees in the distance. However, there were also opportunities for closeups at the nearby Semenggoh Wildlife Center, where apes that have been injured or illegally kept as pets are looked after before being returned to the wild. We can hardly be disappointed. We've sensed the presence of this amazing creature in one of its only surviving habitats. Borneo Adventure, 55 Main Bazaar, Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia; +60 82 245175 .

"Taliban suicide bombers attacked Afghanistan's regional spy headquarters in Ghazni city early Thursday, leaving 21 people dead and more than 150 civilians wounded, a government official said. Nineteen of the dead were the suicide attackers. The remaining two were members of the National Directorate of Security personnel. The NDS is the nation's spy agency. A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack. The assault began when one of the suicide attackers detonated an explosives-filled truck at the front gate of the spy agency, said Shafiq Nang, a spokesman for the governor of Ghazni province.  Twelve of them stormed the NDS.  Six others hit the Rapid Reaction Police headquarters in the city. For the next hour, Afghan security forces battled the Taliban attackers until all of them were killed, he said.  Most of the injuries were the result of broken glass and collapsed roofs from the explosion.","Ghazni is the regional security headquarters for Afghanistan's spy agency .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee refused to retract a statement he made in 1992 calling for the isolation of AIDS patients. Responding to an Associated Press questionnaire, Huckabee said steps should be taken to ""isolate the carriers of this plague"" during his failed run for a U.S. Senate seat from Arkansas 15 years ago. He said he probably would not make the same statement today because of what is known about how HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is transmitted. ""I had simply made the point -- and I still believe this today -- that in the late '80s and early '90s, when we didn't know as much as we do now about AIDS, we were acting more out of political correctness than we were about the normal public health protocols that we would have acted,"" Huckabee told Fox News on Sunday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded in 1985 that AIDS was not transmitted by casual contact. But Huckabee said at the time, ""there were other concerns being voiced by public health officials."" He disputed the characterization that he was calling for individuals infected with HIV to be quarantined. ""Now, would I say things a little differently in 2007? Probably so,"" Huckabee told Fox News. ""But I'm not going to recant or retract from the statement that I did make because, again, the point was not saying we ought to lock people up who have HIV/AIDS."" Huckabee did not explain how individuals with HIV would have been isolated. During his Senate run, Huckabee also told the AP in the questionnaire that he found homosexuality to be ""an aberrant, unnatural and sinful lifestyle."" Speaking Monday in Miami, Florida, Huckabee said he still stands by his earlier remarks on homosexuality.  Watch Huckabee's comments about homosexuals » . ""Let's understand what sin means,"" Huckabee said. ""Sin means missing the mark. Missing the mark could mean missing the mark in any area. We've all missed the mark."" The former Baptist minister said the ""proper relationship"" is one between a married man and woman having children. ""If we didn't have that as the ideal, we wouldn't have a civilization that was able to perpetuate,"" he said. ""So, rather than read into something incredibly out of line, just read into the fact that I believe that the ideal relationship is one-man, one-woman, pro-life."" The former Arkansas governor has come under increased scrutiny since his rapid rise in the polls, particularly in Iowa, where a McClatchy-MSNBC poll conducted December 3-6 has him leading the GOP field with the support of 32 percent of likely caucus-goers. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who had been leading in Iowa for months, was the second closest rival for the GOP presidential nomination, at 20 percent. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points. Huckabee also has come under scrutiny for his role in the parole of a convicted rapist who later went on to rape and kill another woman. As Arkansas governor, Huckabee supported the parole of Wayne DuMond, who was convicted and sentenced to a life term for raping a 17-year-old girl. After DuMond's parole in 1999, he killed a woman in Kansas City, Missouri, in 2003. DuMond died in prison two years later. Huckabee wrote a 1996 letter to DuMond supporting his release from prison, but the candidate said the decision was made by a parole board dominated by appointees of his predecessors, Jim Guy Tucker and Bill Clinton. Former members of the Arkansas Parole Board at the time also said that Huckabee pressured them to approve DuMond's parole, though Huckabee denies doing so. Last week, the mother of the woman DuMond killed in 2003 said she would actively campaign against Huckabee. In an interview with CNN, Huckabee called it ""heartbreaking"" that the rape victims' deaths had become politicized. ""There are families who are truly, understandably and reasonably, grief-stricken,"" Huckabee said. ""And for people to now politicize these deaths and to try to make a political case out of it rather than to simply understand that a system failed and that we ought to extend our grief and heartfelt sorrow to these families, I just regret politics is reduced to that.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Egypt's roiling political unrest is causing the United States to fine-tune a foreign policy equation that for 30 years has valued strategic partnership with President Hosni Mubarak over democratic ideals, experts said Monday. The widespread street demonstrations demanding Mubarak's ouster have so far drawn a measured U.S. response that advocates step-by-step reforms for pro-democracy changes while maintaining stability. Even hawkish conservatives generally opposed to Obama administration policies have backed the U.S. response, citing the overarching need to prevent an unpredictable power vacuum if Mubarak were to be quickly forced out of power. But one of Egypt's leading opposition figures, Mohamed ElBaradei, warned Monday that the United States needs to ""let go"" of its longtime ally. ""You need to review your policy,"" ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" in an interview Monday night. ""You need to let go of Mubarak. You shouldn't be behind the curve, and you need to start building confidence with the people and not with the people who are smothering the people."" It is one of the most complex issues facing President Barack Obama, with Egypt -- the main Arab ally of the United States -- inexorably linked to neighboring Israel -- the main U.S. ally in the Middle East -- by a peace treaty that guarantees more than $1 billion a year in U.S. military aid to Mubarak's government. Egypt also provides vital logistical and intelligence assistance to the United States, which has urged Mubarak for years to implement democratic reforms but always put the strategic benefits first. ""We have to balance our ideals and also our strategic interests,"" former U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday on CNN. ""That balance might have been too far in one direction and not the other."" Daniel Kurtzer, the U.S. ambassador to Egypt from 1997-2001, said the administration wants to both support ""an exceedingly strong ally"" and promote democratic reform and more openness in ""a closed authoritarian society."" ""The United States is trying to find comfortable ground in which we can argue for both without abandoning an ally and without abandoning our principles,"" Kurtzer said in a telephone interview. The unrest in Egypt follows years of social, political and economic grievances that fueled the street protests that began last week and have since escalated. After ruling with an iron fist for three decades, Mubarak has given no indication of giving up power. Demonstrators in Egypt question why Obama, who championed human rights and democracy in a 2009 speech in Cairo, isn't condemning Mubarak and applying pressure to help bring the changes they seek. ElBaradei, who returned to his native Egypt last week as an opposition leader last week, said Egyptians need to see that the United States needs to be seen supporting their aspirations. ""People need to see that you not only talk the talk, but walk the walk, and people need to understand and believe that you really, seriously take democracy, rule of law, freedoms seriously,"" ElBaradei said. Asking ""a dictator"" to implement democratic reforms ""is an oxymoron, frankly."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton outlined the administration's stance in separate interviews Sunday with five television networks, saying the ""complex, very difficult"" situation in Egypt requires careful progress toward a peaceful transition to democracy rather than any sudden or violent change that could undermine the aspirations of the protesters. ""There's no easy answer,"" Clinton said on CNN's ""State of the Union. ""And, clearly, increasing chaos or even violence in the streets, prison breaks, which we've had reports about -- that is not the way to go. ""We want to see this peaceful uprising on the part of the Egyptian people to demand their rights to be responded to in a very clear, unambiguous way by the government, and then a process of national dialogue that will lead to the changes that the Egyptian people seek and that they deserve,"" she said. On Monday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Egypt's government should engage in ""meaningful negotiations with a broad section of civil society, including opposition groups,"" and hold ""free and fair elections"" in September. The transition called for by Clinton ""means change, and what we've advocated from the very beginning is that the way Egypt looks and operates must change,"" Gibbs told reporters. At the same time, he said it is not the place of the United States to support or oppose the possible ouster of Mubarak. Allies concurred, with German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle calling Monday for future ""free and fair elections"" in Egypt. ""We are also interested in a stable situation in the Middle East because, of course, Egypt is a key player for the whole region,"" Westerwelle said. Even administration critics such as conservative Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona have backed the U.S. response so far. ""I hope we all understand how important Egypt is as an ally, as a center of culture,"" McCain said Sunday on CNN, later adding that ""what we need to do now is to lay out a plan for Mubarak to lift the state of emergency, announce that elections -- free and fair -- will be held in September, which were already planned, allow an open and free democratic process -- which I think we could have some confidence (in) if it was an open process that you would see a free and fair election -- and that we make sure that the aspirations of the Egyptian people are realized finally."" But some U.S. politicians disagreed. Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said that ""Mubarak will have to go -- but not without an exit strategy that prevents the government from falling and leaving the door open for extremists."" The next presidential election in Egypt is scheduled for September of this year, Nelson said. ""Right now, there are no term limits in Egypt's Constitution restricting Mubarak from running for re-election for the sixth time. Mubarak must immediately open these elections to international observers and give his written assurance that his name won't appear as a contender. I believe this could help quell the protests."" And McCain's Republican colleague from Arizona, Senator Jon Kyl, sharply criticized the Obama administration for not promoting democracy as strongly as his predecessor. ""We might be in a better position if we had more closely followed President Bush's prescription for support of greater democracy in all parts of the world,"" Kyl said as he stepped off the Senate floor Monday. ""If we had maintained that position and had that reputation in the world ... then our calls today for restraint would have more credibility because the people of Egypt would know our heart was with their desire for greater representation."" To Marina Ottaway, director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the U.S. position amounts to fence-sitting. The unrest in Egypt showed that the U.S. policy of backing Mubarak despite his poor record on political and human rights has failed to bring desired stability, Ottaway said in a telephone interview. Instead of what she labeled ""subtle"" language such as endorsing an orderly transition, the United States should call for a government of national unity to take over until fully democratic elections for both the presidency and the parliament, she said.","NEW: ElBaradei urges U.S. to ""let go"" of Mubarak .

"London, England (CNN) -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his Conservative rival David Cameron both offered to form an alliance with the minority Liberal Democrats Friday as they jostled for power after an election that failed to create an outright winner. The center-right Conservatives won more seats than Brown's Labour party in Thursday's fiercely-contested vote but lacked the majority needed to form an effective government -- a rare outcome in British politics. Cameron emphasized areas where his party and the Liberal Democrats agreed, including education reform and scrapping plans for national ID cards, while drawing red lines on defense and the economy. He was much vaguer on the Liberal Democrats' greatest ambition -- electoral reform -- that would probably give them more seats in parliament. Cameron said: ""The best thing for Britain now is a new government that works together in that national interest,"" adding that the country needed ""a strong, stable government that lasts."" Brown said Friday he would be willing to negotiate with any party leader, but said that Cameron and Liberal leader Nick Clegg were ""entitled to take as much time as they feel necessary"" to forge a coalition. ""Should the discussions between Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg come to nothing then I would of course be prepared to discuss with Mr. Clegg the areas where there may be some measure of agreement between our two parties,"" he said. What happens next? Aware of the uncertainty in the UK financial markets about the outcome of the election and how any future government will tackle the country's budget deficit, both Brown and Cameron pledged to work in the ""national interest."" iReport: Is voting a duty? Clegg indicated he would be willing to talk first to the Conservatives. ""We're in a fluid political situation, "" he said. ""It's vital that all political parties, all political leaders act in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage."" Full election coverage . Official returns Friday showed it would be impossible for any one party to get a majority of seats. The Conservative party came in first, with at least 306 seats in the 650-seat parliament, followed by Brown's Labour party with at least 258. The Liberal Democrats came third, with at least 57. About two dozen seats went to smaller parties. One seat will not be decided until May 27, after the election was delayed due to the death of a candidate. It's very unusual for no party to get an absolute majority of seats in the Commons. The last time it happened, in 1974, voters were back at the polls within months. Hung parliament casts shadow over markets . Several high-profile incumbents lost their seats overnight, including former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, of Labour; and Liberal Democrat Lembit Opik, who had been in parliament for 13 years. All had been implicated in last year's parliamentary expenses scandal. Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson, who has faced questions over land deals and a scandal involving his wife, also lost his seat. The loss of Robinson, head of the Democratic Unionist party, robs the Conservatives of a potential coalition supporter. The Green Party, which favors environmental and social justice policies, gained its first member of parliament when Caroline Lucas was elected in Brighton, in southern England. There were some scenes of voter anger across the country over long lines to cast ballots or polling stations running out of ballot papers, but it was not immediately clear how widespread problems were. Anger at polling stations . ""We will be doing a serious and thorough review of this and making recommendations to parliament and the government,"" Electoral Commission Chairwoman Jenny Watson said. The United Kingdom's system of voting is ""Victorian, antiquated, left over from an era when less people had to vote"" and not designed to cope with mass participation, she said, adding that the system is now ""at breaking point."" Liberal Democrat leader Clegg expressed his anger after hundreds of voters were turned away from a polling station in his Sheffield constituency. Clegg said Friday he was disappointed that an exuberant election campaign buoyed by his stellar performance in the country's first-ever televised prime ministerial debates had failed to deliver hoped-for results. ""Many many people during the election campaign were excited about the prospect of doing something different, but it seems when they came to vote, many of them decided to stick with what they know,"" he said. The Liberal Democrats' principal policy aim is reform to the electoral system which is currently weighted in favor of Labour and the Conservatives. Under the system, the candidate who receives the most votes in a constituency wins. The system, known as ""first past the post,"" is praised for its simplicity and the strong ties it forms between voters and representatives, but critics dislike its failure to provide proportional representation.

"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- As NATO prepares to take over the Libya mission, alliance officials said Friday they are considering a broader role that goes beyond enforcement of a no-fly zone. After days of acrimonious discussion, NATO officials hailed their decision to take command as swift and historic and vowed a ""seamless"" transition of leadership from the United States to NATO, which could happen as early as Sunday. ""In the course of a single week NATO allies have launched both the arms embargo and the no-fly zone operations,"" said NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu. ""This is a clear demonstration of the allies commitment to fulfill their obligations under the U.N. mandate and to show their resolve to do what it takes to protect the people of Libya."" But whether NATO will assume the role of protecting civilians on the ground -- as mandated by a U.N. Security Council resolution -- remains at issue. The operational heart of the mission could hinge on if and when to intervene with airstrikes when civilians appear to be at risk. A decision on what NATO officials are calling ""no-fly plus"" could come as early as Sunday after a meeting of NATO ambassadors. NATO and U.S. officials say discussions are ongoing to bring the entire mission under NATO control. A senior American administration official said that while countries have agreed NATO will take over the rest of the mission, ""there are a couple more steps in the planning process that will need to be taken."" A senior U.S. defense official said that NATO's announcement ""has not caused any change to our operations."" ""They're just taking over an operation that's for the most part, already established,"" the official explained. Beyond that, tense exchanges are also expected at a summit in London next week, where officials will  try to lay out how far they are willing to go militarily against Moammar Gadhafi. ""We expect that ministers will set the wide political guidance at next week's international conference in London to take forward the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 1973,"" Lungescu said. The main question, the officials said, is whether NATO forces should attack Gadhafi's military as part of the mission to protect civilians. The Turkish contingent is arguing for the most limited interpretation of what is allowed under the U.N. resolution. ""The tricky question is when you have a situation where his forces are advancing on some positions rebels hold, do you hit?"" a senior U.S. official asked. ""If there are forces that are trying to get through rebel forces to kill people, there are some in the alliance like the Turks who said, 'we didn't sign up for that.' There are those like the French who are saying, 'of course we did."" The U.S. official said the Obama administration's interpretation is to do whatever is required to protect civilians. In the rush to quickly protect civilians from Gadhafi's forces closing on Benghazi, the sources said that some countries and Arab League Secretary General Amre Moussa might have not fully understood what ""any means necessary"" meant. Officials and diplomats said they are confident the rules of engagement can be worked out over the weekend before NATO takes command. ""Let's just give it a day or two and see where things stand,"" the senior defense official said. Overall NATO command will be based in Naples, Italy, but Turkey has agreed to allow a sub-command stationed at an airbase in Izmir, Turkey. NATO is already supervising naval embargo operations from Naples. The alliance said Friday that Canadian Lt. Gen. Charlie Bouchard, stationed in Naples, will take the lead for the Libya mission. The Turkish air component will help give NATO the credibility it seeks in taking military action against a Muslim nation. The tone of mission, however, already seems to have shifted, with NATO commanders attempting to enforce the U.N. resolution to the letter of the law. ""No-fly zones are impartial, there is no one authorized to fly within that zone,"" said Group Captain Geoffrey Booth of NATO's Air Force Command. ""It is not necessarily pro-Gadhafi or anti-Gadhafi forces. It's the impartial enforcement in line with the (resolution)."" CNN's Chris Lawrence and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NATO is assuming command of the Libya mission .

"Indian police have arrested a second man in connection with the rape of a 5-year-old girl in New Delhi, a police spokesman said Monday. The second suspect is accused of being an accomplice in the case, which has prompted protests in the streets of New Delhi. He is being transferred to New Delhi from Bihar state in eastern India for questioning and DNA tests, said Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat. Police say the first suspect arrested in the case, Manoj Kumar, told them about the alleged accomplice during questioning. Kumar, the girl's neighbor, is accused of abducting her on April 14, locking her in his home and raping her repeatedly. She was found semiconscious three days later. Doctors said they had to remove objects, including candle pieces and a small bottle, from the girl's genitals. Her condition has since stabilized. Alleged rape of 5-year-old spurs protests . The situation has taken on another sordid aspect after the girl's family said that police officers had tried to bribe them to keep quiet about the case. Senior police officials have ordered a separate investigation into those allegations. The assault on the 5-year-old came just four months after a 23-year-old physiotherapy student was gang-raped in a bus in New Delhi, setting off furious protests in India. She later died at a Singapore hospital. That attack raised a lot of questions about the treatment of women in India, with the country's news media suddenly turning their attention to some of the thousands of rape cases reported in the nation each year. The case of the 5-year-old has now drawn attention to violent crimes against children, particularly girls. In a recent report, the Asian Center For Human Rights cited statistics it said showed 48,338 child rape cases were reported in India between 2001 and 2011. The report said the number of cases had risen from 2,113 cases in 2001 to 7,112 in 2011. The 5-year-old girl's case sparked protests in New Delhi last week. Many demonstrators are members of a political party of the leading anti-corruption activist, Arvind Kejriwal. Criticized for what was seen as his late response to the December gang-rape, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh promptly issue a statement this time, calling the act ""shameful.""","Allegations police tried to bribe the girl's family to keep quiet are being investigated .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush on Wednesday signed the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, calling it a ""booster shot"" for the American economy. ""The bill I'm signing today is large enough to have an impact, amounting to more than $152 billion this year, or about 1 percent of the GDP (gross domestic product),"" the president said in the brief ceremony in the East Room of the White House. The government hopes the measure, which will send most Americans tax rebate checks by May, will either prevent a recession or make one relatively brief. The package also includes tax breaks for equipment purchases by businesses, as well as payments to disabled veterans and some senior citizens. The bipartisan measure moved through Congress at relative break-neck speed, going from initial discussions to enactment in less than four weeks. The package will pay $600 to most individual taxpayers and $1,200 to married taxpayers filing joint returns, so long as they are below income caps of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for couples. There is also a $300 per child tax credit. Watch Bush sign stimulus bill into law » . The rebates will put about $120 billion in the hands of individuals in the hope that they will spend it and boost a faltering U.S. economy. Economists generally agree that the economy should see a boost from the rebate checks. But most also agree that the full impact will be less than the total value of the stimulus package. That's because some recipients are expected to save their rebates or use them to pay down credit cards or other debt instead of spending it. In addition, some consumers may spend their rebates on imported items, which would provide a more limited lift to the U.S. economy. ""My guess is that of the $110 billion to $120 billion of tax rebates, about half will go to U.S. products and services,"" said David Wyss, chief economist for Standard & Poor's. There also are questions about whether the stimulus will actually be the key to ending or preventing a recession. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said last week that the Internal Revenue Service planned to send the rebate checks to about 130 million Americans. ""They're going to be getting ready to get checks out, and believe me, they will. ... And this is largely going to be done by the time summer's over. And so we're going to move quickly and make a difference,"" he said . Bush praised the quick work of the House and Senate and urged Americans not to ""overreact"" to the current economic troubles. ""In the past seven years, the system has absorbed shocks: recession, corporate scandals, terror attacks, global war; yet the genius of our system is that it can absorb such shocks and emerge even stronger,"" he said. ""In a dynamic market economy, our economy will prosper and it will continue to be the marvel of the world."" E-mail to a friend .

"As India grapples with how to better protect women and girls from sexual assault, a court over the weekend convicted six men in the gang rape of a Swiss tourist. The court in the province of Datia sentenced them to life in prison on Saturday for the March rape and robbery, public prosecutor Rajendra Iwari said. The men have denied the charges and may appeal. The victim and her husband were on a cycling tour across India and had set up camp near a forest in Datia district when a group of men assaulted them, beating the husband and raping the wife, according to police. Anger, frustration over rapes in India: 'Mindset hasn't changed' The men were members of a local tribe who live near where the travelers were camping. Investigators recovered valuables stolen from the couple during the attack, including a laptop computer, a mobile phone and 10,000 rupees ($185). The couple decided to stay in India to pursue charges against the men. Keeping chivalry alive in India: Men respond to rape crisis . News of the incident triggered protests organized by opposition lawmakers in India's Madhya Pradesh state. They called on the state's home minister to resign due to an alleged ""collapse of law and order,"" as Ajay Singh, an opposition leader, put it at the time.

"The massive hurricane barreling toward the East Coast has both presidential campaigns throwing out their fourth-quarter playbooks, canceling events in the storm's track and attempting to balance last-minute intensity with a show of compassion for people whose lives could be upended. On Sunday, politicos from both sides said it was still too early to tell how the storm would affect the race, but that access to voting centers would be a concern if effects from the storm persist until Election Day. ""I don't think anybody really knows,"" top Obama adviser David Axelrod said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" about the potential political impact of Hurricane Sandy. ""Obviously, we want unfettered access to the polls because we believe that the more people come out, the better we're going to do, and so to the extent that it makes it harder, you know, that's a source of concern. But I don't know how all the politics will sort out."" Live blog: Hurricane Sandy . Virginia's Republican governor said Sunday his state would take measures to ensure residents are able to vote, despite potential obstacles brought on by the storm. ""We'll be ready, but we're planning for contingencies if there's still a problem,"" Bob McDonnell said on ""State of the Union."" He said his state would ""absolutely"" make polling centers such as schools and fire stations a top priority for restoring power should widespread outages occur. Another Virginian, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, predicted on Fox News the ""storm will throw havoc into the race."" Obama, Romney campaigns cancel events ahead of hurricane . In Virginia, the effects of a major storm could linger until Election Day. Hundreds of thousands of customers in Northern Virginia lost power for more than week after Hurricane Irene in August 2011 and again in June after a powerful complex of thunderstorms called a derecho moved through. Residents' priorities might still be dealing with the storm's aftermath rather than a trip to the polls. Virginia offers early absentee voting only with an excuse, unlike other states that offer less restrictive ways to cast ballots before November 6. That means the race in the commonwealth will be won or lost on Election Day. North Carolina and Maryland, two other states in the storm's projected path, offer in-person early voting, which has benefited Democrats in the past. Martin O'Malley, Maryland's Democratic governor, canceled early voting on Monday in his state. In Delaware, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, residents only have the option of voting early by mail. Hurricane Sandy: 5 things to know . Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, predicted Sunday the storm could help boost Obama in the eyes of voters, but said he doubted the image of a strong leader would sway voters after months of campaigning. ""I think that the president of the United States is the commander in chief,"" McCain said on CBS. ""The American people look to him, and I'm sure he will conduct himself and play his leadership role in a fine fashion. So I would imagine that might help him a little bit. But I'm not sure it will affect votes.  People have been exposed to this very long campaign."" Obama is being briefed regularly on the storm's path, White House officials say, and he will balance his campaign with his responsibilities as president. ""This is an example yet again of the president having to put his responsibilities as commander in chief and as leader of the country first while at the same time he pursues his responsibilities as candidate for election,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday. In a statement Sunday at the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Obama warned Americans in the storm's path to prepare. ""This is a serious and big storm,"" Obama said at FEMA, adding ""you need to take this seriously and take guidance from state and local officials."" Obama advises preparedness ahead of storm . While Obama will balance governing and campaigning this week, Romney will also face the task of adopting the right tone during a time of crisis for a large chunk of the East Coast. A top Republican conceded even ""weather-safe"" swing states such as Colorado and Ohio might be difficult campaign stops for Romney if Hurricane Sandy devastates the Eastern Seaboard with widespread injuries, deaths or life-threatening situations. Disasters, natural and otherwise, are always a difficult balancing act for politicians of all stripes who don't want to be seen as uncaring, even if there is little for them to do. ""It gets tricky,"" the source conceded. ""Optics are important."" That source said the Romney campaign will ""play it by ear"" as the storm unfolds. Romney campaign spokesman Kevin Madden said Sunday afternoon that campaign workers in Virginia ""are doing as much as they can to help with relief efforts."" The former Massachusetts governor and the president have already canceled stops in Virginia, a pivotal swing state expected to be hard hit. Vice President Joe Biden canceled a Saturday event in Virginia and one scheduled for Monday in New Hampshire. Both campaigns cited a desire not to use resources better targeted toward pre-storm preparations. Crowley: Sandy introduces big unknown into campaign . Ann Romney, who was slated to campaign in New Hampshire on Monday, canceled her events, and the Romney campaign said the bus that was to be used for her visit would instead be deployed for ""relief efforts throughout the East Coast."" Both campaigns said they were suspending fundraising e-mails to supporters in Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey and the District of Columbia. Obama canceled trips to the battlegrounds of Ohio and Colorado to stay in Washington and monitor the oncoming storm, though a campaign trip to Florida remained on the president's schedule for Monday. Romney is scheduled to campaign in Ohio, Iowa and Wisconsin on Monday, then in Ohio on Tuesday. A Romney campaign stop scheduled for Tuesday in New Hampshire was canceled late Sunday afternoon, the campaign announced in an e-mai. Opinion: How Sandy will test Obama, Romney . Madden said the campaign would continue to update Romney's calendar, based on where the storm goes. ""The schedule we have locked down for now are in states that are not directly impacted by the storm,"" he said. ""But, again, we're going to continue to update it. We're going to continue to monitor the situation and stay in close contact with folks that are in the states that have the best information."" This is the second time the campaign has been affected by a major weather event. Hurricane Isaac forced the cancellation of the first day of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, in August. Asked whether the Romney campaign felt snake-bitten by Mother Nature, Madden said, ""Well, there's certain things we can't control and nature's one of them. So we just try to have focus on what we can control and part of what we can control is making sure that safety is a priority for the people that are in harm's way in some of these states that are going to be directly impacted and so that's a top concern and it'll remain a top concern."" While the political experts navigated the ramifications of the storm, at least one campaign had more practical matters in mind. Tim Kaine, the Democratic Senate candidate in Virginia, e-mailed supporters to ask them to take their yard signs down during the storm, lest they become projectiles.","Romney and Obama campaigns cancel events because of hurricane .

"Celeste (Rashida Jones) and Jesse (Andy Samberg) have what appears at first to be the perfect modern relationship. The two have known each other since the 10th grade, but never take each other for granted. They're warm, responsive, and fun-loving, with lots of shared rituals and cutesy little private games. Out to dinner with their best friends (Ari Graynor and Eric Christian Olsen), they talk about what they're going to order by lapsing into showbiz World War II Chuhmin accents (clearly a favorite routine of theirs), which allows them to tweak each other's foibles -- like who's going to do more mooching off the other's plate -- while keeping the interaction light. These two are so funny and affectionate, so made for each other, they're not just friends or lovers. They seem more like newlyweds. And by the way... they're getting divorced. Huh? ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" throws us that curveball early on, and it establishes the movie as a romantic comedy powered by a question as novel and provocative as the one that drove ""When Harry Met Sally"": Can a man and woman be friends? The question here is more along the lines of: Can a man and woman who were more than friends realize they still might be? So why are Celeste and Jesse splitting up? We hear the rationale in bits and pieces, and it doesn't sound all that major -- mostly issues of unequal careers. She's a celebrity trend-spotter, he's a gifted graphic artist who's doing...not much. He's a passive underachiever. NBC defends Olympics coverage . Initially, I fought the film's premise. I thought: Couldn't Jesse try a bit harder? Couldn't the two get some couples therapy? That, however, is all part of the movie's design. Even when Celeste and Jesse start dating other people, they are still hooked on each other -- and maybe that's what they need to let go of. We're not quite certain, since Andy Samberg and Rashida Jones forge a connection so rich in chemistry and personal nuance. Samberg, taking on his first role that's more dramatic than comedic, is intensely compelling; he uses his big, wide, open features to play Jesse as a dude bristling with an ironic cleverness that can't mask his feelings. And Jones, who was so winning in ""I Love You, Man,"" makes Celeste a study in engagingly high-functional yuppie self-delusion. She wants to control everything, including her romantic impulses. Only that's not how it works. 'Red Dawn' photos: It's Thor and Peeta! ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" bounces along with nimble invention, from a photo montage that colors in an entire romantic history to the hilarious scene in which Celeste, increasingly jealous, gets caught going through Jesse's garbage can.

"In a dusty, run-down neighborhood on the outskirts of Lucknow, the capital of one of India's poorest and most conservative states, Uttar Pradesh, a vigilante group is making a name for itself. But these are no ordinary vigilantes. They're girls -- mainly teenagers -- who patrol their local streets protecting women and girls from sexual harassment. In their matching black and red black salwar kameez -- the traditional garb worn by women across South Asia -- they target offending males who have over-stepped the mark. The punishment? Humiliation, sometimes worse. Their motivation is painfully clear. Every single girl in the so-called ""Red Brigade"" has been a victim of sexual assault -- some have even been raped by their own family members, they say. In most cases, the crimes have gone unpunished and the victim left to suffer the trauma in silent shame. These girls have been forced to act, they say, because no one else will. OPINION: Rewiring of society's attitude needed . Cultural stigma . While sex crimes are not exclusive to India, the number of reported rapes there has increased dramatically, from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011, according to official figures. But campaigners say this is the tip of the iceberg. Most women in India -- a country where a cultural stigma keeps many victims from reporting the crime -- have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, according to the Indian Council on Global Relations. The issue appeared to reach a tipping point in India in December last year, when a 23-year-old woman was raped and fatally beaten by a group of men while traveling home on a public bus in Delhi. The attack provoked outrage across the world and sparked nationwide demonstrations in India, as protesters called for tougher laws on sex crimes and a change in attitudes towards women. With global attention trained on India following the appalling case in the capital, the authorities acknowledged that action was needed. Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said India plans to recruit more female police officers -- currently only 7% of the Indian police force is female, according to government figures. The first fast-track court hearings have also been introduced to try to expedite cases in a justice system bogged down by red tape. It means sessions of the trial, once it begins, should take place nearly every working day until a verdict is reached. Still, new cases continue to shock the nation, such as the 7-year-old girl who was raped in a train bathroom last weekend after she was lured away from her parents. OPINION: Death penalty not the solution . Fightback on . The fight against sexual discrimination on the streets of Lucknow preceded the international attention on sex crimes in India. The self-defense group was started several years ago by teacher Usha Vishwakarma, who discovered that an 11-year-old girl she taught in the modest school block opposite her family home had been raped by her uncle. Not long after this revelation, Vishwakarma found herself facing the unwanted attention of a colleague, who then tried to attack her. She managed to fight him off, but when she tried to report the incident, the local police were unimpressed. No one seemed to care. ""This really upset me. It really affected me -- I would see any man in the street and would get upset and angry,"" Vishwakarma, 26, told CNN. She said people in her community thought she had gone mad. But still nothing happened to her attacker. Eventually she learned that all of her students had experienced some form of abuse -- from lewd comments and cat-calls, to molestation and rape. Many of the girls said they were afraid to go out alone for fear of being groped or worse. It was then that Vishwakarma decided the girls had to protect themselves amid the deafening silence from within their own community. The ""Red Brigade"" was born -- the red in their uniform is to symbolize danger and struggle, while the black represents protest. In groups of four or five, the girls approach males deemed to be harassing a girl and order them to stop. If the perpetrator refuses to heed their warning, they punish him by mocking him publicly -- a significant slight in such a male-dominated society. Vishwakarma admitted they have been forced to resort to violence on more than one occasion -- though she emphasized this doesn't go beyond slapping. ""The whole idea is to humiliate them,"" she said. ""We are well within our rights -- this is self-defense. The police are not supportive so we have to defend ourselves."" Martial means . And defend themselves they can, if their regular martial arts classes are anything to go by. In a dusty gym on the other side of town, the girls -- 15 of them -- are put through their paces on threadbare mats by a local Kung Fu instructor.  He drills them in several techniques, from punching and kicking, to breaking the hold of an attacker approaching from behind. A faded picture of martial arts legend Bruce Lee gazes down approvingly, as each of the girls attacks the instructor's padding with intense focus and conviction. They have plenty to be angry about. Gyan, their instructor, explained that he's teaching the girls for free. ""I'm doing it for my own daughter,"" he said.  ""These girls are brave and what they are doing is humbling."" The session ended with the girls lining up and bowing respectfully at their instructor. They have clearly learned how to channel their anger -- an asset on the unforgiving streets outside. But it's not just Kung Fu training the girls receive -- the group provides a lot of support on gender issues, sexuality and health. It even helps younger children to attend school. Protest . Hours later, the girls were joined by several other supporters for a protest on the side of a busy highway in the center of Lucknow. Led by Vishwakarma, the girls held placards in English and Hindi demanding safety for women and chanted for stricter punishment for sex offenders. The scale of their task is perfectly illustrated by this small band of determined girls fighting against the tidal wave of Lucknow's late afternoon traffic. Some commuters clinging from buses look quizzically at the small protest, while others ignore the scene completely. Asked whether they are dealing with a deep-rooted cultural problem, Vishwakarma's 16-year-old sister, Lakshmi, shook her head emphatically. ""This is not a cultural problem -- it's a social problem because men have a higher social status than girls."" The roadside protest may only have attracted a small number of people, but for Vishwakarma, the Red Brigade is making a difference. ""Those who were voiceless before -- the girls -- now have a voice. Now they speak for themselves and are emboldened,"" she said. With two daughters campaigning against a hugely divisive issue in India, Vishwakarma's mother admitted she had reservations about what they were getting into. ""I was scared initially -- I asked 'why is she was doing this?' There was also a lot of pressure from within the neighborhood that she should not be doing what she was. Because she would hold meetings late at night, people would say 'your daughter is not coming back home until late at night, which is not good.' ""Then someone said to me 'let her to what she wants to do.' I now feel what they are doing is good and helping to bring a lot of change -- many boys who used to harass girls no longer do so because they are scared."" Asked where she gets her courage from, Vishwakarma replied simply: ""When you suffer, you get that courage. When you are victimized, you get that courage.""","The Red Brigade is a group of young girls fighting against sexual abuse .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- As Iran extended the deadline Tuesday to file complaints about the disputed presidential election, one candidate lashed out at the hardline government while another went the opposite direction and withdrew his accusations. Opposition candidate Mehdi Karroubi, a reformist, has strongly criticized Iran's state-controlled media. Opposition candidate Mehdi Karroubi strongly criticized Iran's state-controlled media and supporters of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, likening them to the Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan. Karroubi, in a letter addressed to the head of state-run radio and television, scolded Iranian media for blaming recent violence and chaos on the demonstrators who took to the streets after the results of what they believed were fraudulent elections on June 12. The ""assaults, beatings and murder of innocent people"" were committed by plain-clothed security forces, not by demonstrators as the Iranian media would like its audiences to believe, Karroubi said in an open letter addressed to Ezattollah Zarghami, which was posted on Karroubi's Web site. ""You know well that those who support Mr. Ahmadinejad's government today are promoters of fanatic and Taliban-like Islam,"" Karroubi said. All of Iran's media outlets are controlled by the government.  Watch how Iranian TV is covering the crisis » . CNN could not confirm the authenticity of Karroubi's statement because international journalists have been restricted in covering events in Iran. Karroubi, a former Parliament speaker and a leading reformist candidate in 2005, saw his support plunge from 15 percent he won that year to less than 1 percent in the June 12 election. Both he and  Ahmadinejad's chief rival, Mir Hossein Moussavi, have questioned the legitimacy of the vote count and called for the cancellation of the election. Iran extended the deadline for registering such complaints on Tuesday at the request of the powerful conservative Guardian Council, Iran's government-funded Press TV reported Tuesday. The Guardian Council wrote to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei requesting the extension for candidates to register complaints, the semiofficial Fars News Agency reported. The supreme leader acceded to the request Tuesday night; the new deadline is Sunday. But even as the deadline was extended, another candidate, Mohsen Rezaie, withdrew his earlier complaint about voting irregularities and demand for a recount of the ballots. In a letter addressed to the Guardian Council that was posted on Rezaie's Web site Tuesday, the presidential candidate said he had intended to follow up his accusations. But, he said, as a ""selfless soldier for the Islamic republic,"" he could not pursue his allegations given the ""critical"" and ""pivotal"" political and social conditions of the country. He said controlling the situation was more important than election results. CNN could not determine the authenticity of the posting.  Watch impact of social media on Iranian protests » . Officials declared incumbent Ahmadinejad the winner of the presidential election by a margin of 2 to 1 over his nearest rival, Moussavi, to the surprise of many who had expected the challenger to win. Moussavi accused the government of vote-rigging and demonstrators have been protesting the results for more than a week. A Facebook account in the name of former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, a reformist, called for daily protests at markets across the nation, starting Tuesday. ""We shall bring our children along, and peacefully continue our protests. No sign boards, without wearing green (the color protesters have adopted), we go towards the bazaar with the intention of shopping. However we will buy nothing and we go with the aim of closing down the bazaar. We shall leave no marks or traces behind ourselves, not even showing the victory sign with our hands,"" says the post on the Facebook page, which CNN cannot confirm is run by the former president.  Watch how the election has become a civil rights movement » . A message posted on Twitter said more than 10,000 people demonstrated in the eastern city of Tabriz, where Moussavi comes from. The Iranian government has put tight restrictions on CNN and other journalists, making it difficult to confirm reports such as the one from Tabriz. Pro-government militias were out on Tehran streets Tuesday, but many drivers put their hazard lights on as a sign of support for the protests, eyewitnesses told CNN. CNN is not naming them for security reasons. U.S. President Obama said Tuesday that Iran's government must justify itself not in the eyes of the United States, but in the opinion of its own people. ""A sizable percentage of the Iranian people themselves ... consider this election illegitimate,"" he said at a White House news conference. ""It is not too late for the Iranian government to recognize that there is a peaceful path that will lead to stability and prosperity,"" he said. ""We hope they take it."" Shortly before he spoke, Iranian state-run media reported Ahmadinejad will be sworn in to a second term between July 26 and August 19. The Iranian parliament's board of directors said he will be sworn in and will present his new Cabinet to parliament during the three-and-a-half week period, government-funded Press TV reported, citing the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). France on Tuesday blasted Iran's ""brutal crackdown on the demonstrations,"" its foreign ministry announced. The ministry summoned Iran's ambassador to Paris ""and called for the immediate release of those arrested, as well as respect for the freedom of the press and communication and the right to demonstrate,"" it said in a statement. It was the second time France has called the ambassador on the carpet since the election. Iran and the United Kingdom engaged in a round of tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions as France was stating its position. Iran expelled two British diplomats Monday, and London responded by expelling two Iranian diplomats Tuesday, the Foreign Office in London told CNN.  Watch as European governments step up criticism » . Additionally, Iranian authorities have arrested a reporter for The Washington Times in Tehran, Iran's semiofficial Fars News Agency said Tuesday. Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoris Delvakouras confirmed that Iason Athanasiadis was taken into custody by Iranian authorities late last week. Athens is in touch with the Iranian authorities, working to get him released, the spokesman said. Athanasiadis was traveling on a Greek passport, he added. ""We hope the situation will be resolved very soon,"" Washington Times Executive Editor John Solomon said in a statement. It was unclear why the reporter was arrested, according to Fars, which cited Iran's director of foreign news media, Mohsen Moghadaszadeh. Iran's government has restricted international journalists from covering street rallies protesting the results of the election. On Sunday, the BBC said Iran had expelled Jon Leyne, its permanent correspondent in Tehran. Also on Sunday, a Canadian-Iranian working for Newsweek magazine in Tehran was ""detained without charge"" by Iranian authorities, according to the magazine. And the Tehran bureau of the Dubai-based Arab satellite station Al-Arabiya was ordered closed, the station said.  Watch a student protester make a plea for help to the world » . According to Reporters Without Borders, 36 journalists have been arrested -- 26 of them Iranian -- since the presidential election while ""many others"" are missing. Ahmadinejad was declared the winner of the race two hours after the deadline for voting, while some precincts were still open. Iran's interior ministry has said that 85 percent of the country's 46 million eligible voters cast ballots.

"The worst possible outcome for the country from the impasse over the continuing resolution that would prevent a government shutdown would be for House Republicans to cave. This is a pivotal conflict that will define the relationship between Congress and the executive branch for the next three years. The country will be much better off if Congress does not abdicate its constitutional role and if the president cannot ignore that role. When President Barack Obama is willing to negotiate with Russian, Syrian and Iranian leaders but unwilling to negotiate with the U.S. House of Representatives, it is time for the House to stand firm. When Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says, according to unnamed sources quoted in Politico, that he will refuse to attend a negotiation at the White House because House Republicans have to cave and surrender to his terms, it is time to stand firm. When a senior, unnamed Democratic official is quoted Monday morning calling for no negotiations and saying ""it's time to punch the bully in the nose,"" it is time to stand firm. Begala: Bet on Obama in shutdown showdown . When Obama spends a week making three partisan speeches attacking Republicans and then calls House Speaker John Boehner to tell him, ""I will not negotiate,"" it is time to stand firm. It is a sad commentary on Obama's attitude toward the elected majority of the House of Representatives that he could have a more pleasant conversation with the head of the Iranian dictatorship than with the elected leader of the U.S. House. The left has sold itself on a false history of the 2012 election. According to the left, Obama won the election and therefore we should do whatever he wants. This ignores that there was also an election for the ""People's House"" in 435 congressional districts, and the Republicans won. It also ignores the 63 million Americans who voted against his re-election and his agenda. Winning 52% does not mean he gets 100% of what he wants. Zelizer: Government shutdown threat is getting very old, very fast . The president has decided to seek to bully and bluff his way to get what he wants. House Republicans must not abdicate their responsibilities now. Any surrender on the continuing resolution would confirm the contempt with which Obama and Reid already hold Boehner and his Republican colleagues. This fight is about something much bigger than the Republican Party and the future of Obamacare. It is about whether the president dictates to America's elected representatives or negotiates with them when they disagree. It will be very bad for America if a president whose hubris is astounding is reinforced in the belief that he can bully his way into getting everything he wants by making demagogic attack speeches. The next few weeks might be painful if House Republicans insist on getting to a compromise and refuse to surrender. But the next three years will be frightening if House Republicans cave and the president learns that nothing stands between him and his ability to use overweening power outside the Constitution to advance his ideology. This is a big moment of decision for America. Don't give in now.","Newt Gingrich: Worst possible outcome on budget showdown would be if GOP backed down .

"Aerobatic stunt teams will provide Singapore's international airshow with entertainment, but the real dogfights for billion dollar contracts take place behind closed doors. The world's third biggest aviation event takes place later this month, a mix of trade conference and national flag-waving with a whiff of kerosene and big money in the air. The main players in the civil aviation industry will be in town, with announcements on new sales from the big plane makers expected, plus Indonesia's flagship carrier Garuda rumored to be set to announce new additions to its fleet. Apart from the airline industry workhorses and business planes for the global jet-set, the event is also a grand bazaar for airborne weaponry where makers of combat aircraft and defense department bigwigs meet to talk shop and see some of the multi-million dollar hardware in action. ""There are high ranking generals walking around these events,"" says Gareth Jennings, Managing Editor of  Jane's Missiles and Rockets. ""Sometimes they are walking around in full uniform and happy to be noticed. It's about being seen and building international partnerships."" But away from the gold brocade and gleaming aircraft on show, the aviation industry, both military and civilian, doesn't have quite the same lustre. It faces the same problems as many other export industries, that of slow growth and the need to find new markets. The United States, Russia and western European countries dominate the manufacture of weapons, but against a backdrop of U.S. defense cuts and a recession-haunted Europe, they are no longer the main markets for sales. ""In Europe it's pretty much stagnant,"" says Jennings.  ""If anything (European countries) are trying to offload the equipment they've got, interestingly to developing countries because that's where the money is,"" says Jennings. Not all European defense departments are taking on the role of second-hand car salesmen, but the need to cut back or suspend deals means that more than ever Asia, South America and the Middle East are prime targets for arms companies. Between 2006 and 2010, six of the ten largest importers of weapons came from the Asia Pacific region, according to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), and companies from the west will be hoping that trend continues. ""There have been some large scale acquisitions in the (Asia) region,"" says Paul Holtom of SIPRI. ""In Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore there have been significant naval and combat aircraft orders,"" he says. ""Suggestions are that some of these acquisitions are looking at China as defense posturing, but also 'Keeping up with the Joneses.' We do see that tendency in that region."" India has been the worlds biggest recipient of combat aircraft for the past six years and is unlikely to cede that title soon. It is expected to announce who will supply its new fleet of multi-role fighter jets in the next few months and the battle between companies for the estimated $20 billion contract has raged for years. The recent news that Dassault's Rafale jet is the cheaper option and preferred bidder could save the French company that had been rumored to be in financial trouble for failing for find a single export order for its jet. One of the big draws at this year's show and on display will be the Lockheed Martin F35 -- the only game in town, says Jennings, when it comes to the next generation of fighter jet. While it has had some setbacks in development, Jennings believes they have mostly been overcome and is set to a big winner for the company. But it will have to be, he says. ""It's a big project. To achieve the cost figures they're looking at, around $57 million per aircraft once full production is going, they're going to have to get as many customers as possible."" While Asian countries including China, South Korea and India are developing their own fighter planes it will be a long time before they can compete with the established players in the industry from Europe, Russia and the U.S., believes Jennings. Instead a big area of development and procurement is in unmanned drones. The U.S. and Israel dominate the market for those with strike capabilities, but the capacity for other countries to develop smaller unmanned aerial vehicles is growing. ""You see them cropping up almost everywhere,"" says Holtom. ""Countries like Azerbaijan that you wouldn't normally assume to be a significant arms producer are looking to set up cooperative production arrangements so they can produce their own. From tiny things that can be launched by hand to the largest systems; it's cost effective rather than manned vehicles."" If the aircraft are getting smaller, the skies and aviation marketplace are set to become more crowded while manufacturers hope the deals will remains just as large.","Singapore is Asia's biggest airshow .

"Edward Snowden may have left the city, but on Friday Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales told a crowd of devotees gathered in Hong Kong for the website's annual ""Wikimania"" conference that the fugitive leaker's actions had given him new ideas about the online encyclopedia's future. ""We live in the era of Snowden and (WikiLeaks founder Julian) Assange,"" declared Wales in a keynote address to the crowd, which organizers said had over 500 people from 90 countries. ""All kinds of information that people would prefer to remain secret or private are being exposed."" Wales said Snowden's leaks about sweeping spy programs caused him to have a ""serious rethink about security."" Fearing intrusions from government agencies like the National Security Agency in the U.S., Wales announced that Wikipedia would move to encrypt its pages using SSL, or secure socket layer encryption, which protects users from outside monitoring. Pointing to examples of poor mainstream media coverage on internet security issues, Wales also asked Wikipedians to help him think of a new ""hybrid model"" of journalism, where volunteers could work with professional journalists to produce serious stories that would counter ""tabloid nonsense"" like stories about the girlfriend of Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked some of the agency's top secret programs to the media from a hotel room in Hong Kong before receiving temporary asylum in Russia. Wales showed an image of mainstream news clippings to prove his point. ""(Snowden's girlfriend) is heartbroken because he's fled Hawaii ... he misses his girlfriend... I don't see anything here about who exactly is going to get arrested at the NSA for spying on people illegally,"" he said. ""What we really need to do is use editorial judgment to say, 'What really matters?'"" He proposed a setup in which a carefully vetted volunteer community could be potentially be ""in charge of"" mainstream journalists. Stressing that it was merely a brainstorm, the Wikipedia founder invited his community to email him with software and design ideas. Reactions to the Wiki-journalism idea were mixed among attendees. ""I think [Wales] didn't think about it very much,"" said Silvia Stieneker, 35, a Wikimedia employee from Germany. ""You cannot compare media that has to sell headlines to make them interesting to something like an encyclopedia."" ""I don't think it will replace traditional newspapers,"" said Andre Costa, who works for Wikimedia in Sweden, ""but it should be an alternative."" In an interview with CNN Wales said he had ""great hope"" that there would be demand for the idea. ""Some have this negativity that oh, the problem is the general public, they just want to read sexy stories about Kim Kardashian or whatever, it's hopeless, right? ""But you know what? A website that's more popular than the top 20 newspapers in the world combined is Wikipedia. And people are reading very serious things on Wikipedia. There's clearly a demand from the public."" ""I think it's time we start being a little more radical in our thinking."" Another key topic discussed at this year's Wikimania was diversity. ""I think Wikipedia has a sexism problem,"" said Stieneker, who runs a workshop in Berlin that empowers women to write for Wikipedia. Stieneker says ""harsh words for women"" are still sometimes used to attack female users, particularly in debates over articles related to gender issues. But she acknowledged that ""the huge majority of Wikipedia is not sexist and very helpful."" She says just seven percent of the German Wikipeida community are women, compared to 13% of the general Wikipedia population. Wales is aware of the imbalance. ""We really want more women editing,"" he told CNN. ""We're doing a lot of outreach programs."" Wikipedians say other inequalities also exist on the site. Josh Lim, a Wikipedia project director from the Philippines, said he has seen ""culture clashes"" between Wikipedia's ""core demographic of white, highly-educated males in Western countries"" and editors of less-represented backgrounds. ""An American administrator might delete an article about a school in the Philippines because he thinks it's 'not notable,' which we would take personally,"" he said. According to Lim, ""systemic bias"" from Westerners has discouraged his team, and many editors have left. Wales acknowledged the tensions.  ""There will always be some cultural conflict around the edges about what's notable and not. And sometimes we make the wrong decisions."" ""But we generally get it right because our community has a spirit of inquiry and desire of understanding. And it's great if a member of our community stands up and says we're doing this wrong, and you need to stop and think about it."" ""One of the great things about the Wikipedia community -- that can be exhausting -- is we talk about everything,"" said Wales.","Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales calls for new model of journalism .

"Seventy one years ago -- December 22, 1942 -- Congress got the United States out of what had turned into an unexpectedly embarrassing situation. It concerned the Pledge of Allegiance -- specifically, something called the Bellamy Salute. Most people today have likely never heard of it, but the Bellamy Salute was once a constant part of the country's life. Until 1892, there was no such thing as a Pledge of Allegiance. Daniel Sharp Ford, the owner of a magazine called Youth's Companion, was on a crusade to put American flags in every school in the country. He sensed that the U.S. needed a boost of patriotism. Keep in mind: Not even 30 years before, the Civil War had still been raging. National unity was a fragile concept. As part of the campaign, Sharp gave an assignment to a member of his staff: Francis J. Bellamy, who was an author, a  minister and an advocate of the tenets of Christian socialism. Sharp asked Bellamy to compose a Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.  Bellamy wrote it, and it was published in the magazine. It didn't take long for the Pledge to become wildly popular, even omnipresent. At schools, at campgrounds, at public gatherings, in Congress, people routinely faced the flag and pledged their allegiance to it. Because, inherently, there is something physically awkward about people simply standing in place, their arms hanging limply by their sides, staring at a flag and reciting a pledge, it was decided that devising a salute would be appropriate. Instructions for carrying out the salute were printed in the pages of Youth's Companion. The gesture came to be called the Bellamy Salute, in honor of the Pledge's author. The Bellamy Salute consisted of each person -- man, woman or child -- extending his or her right arm straight forward, angling slightly upward, fingers pointing directly ahead. With their right arms aiming stiffly toward the flag, they recited: ""I pledge allegiance..."" For a while, the salute wasn't especially controversial. But, as World War II was forming in Europe, and Italians and Germans began saluting Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler with extended-armed ""Heil Hitler!""-style gestures... Well, perhaps you can see the problem. In the United States there was a growing feeling of discomfort that, when people within the nation's own borders pledged their right-arms-extended allegiance to the flag, they might be construed as inadvertently showing solidarity with the fascist regimes across the ocean. Richard J. Ellis, in his book ""To the Flag: The Unlikely History of the Pledge of Allegiance,"" wrote that ""the similarities in the salute had begun to attract comment as early as the mid-1930s."" Newsreels and still photos were regularly depicting rallies in Europe's dictatorships, with thousands of people showing their fealty by extending straight-armed salutes. In the United States, the general unease about it -- ""the embarrassing resemblance between the 'Heil Hitler' salute and the salute that accompanied the Pledge of Allegiance,"" in Richard Ellis's words -- was combined with the fear that scenes of Americans offering the Bellamy Salute could be used for propaganda purposes. It wouldn't be terribly difficult to crop the American flag out of photos of U.S. citizens reciting the Pledge of Allegiance; without the flag in the shots, the photos could be mischaracterized as proof  that Americans were expressing support for the ideologies of Hitler and Mussolini. Thus, on December 22, 1942, Congress, just before its Christmas break, took care of it. On that day, the amended Flag Code was passed, Section 7 of which decreed that the Pledge of Allegiance should ""be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart."" And with that, it became official: Those millions of extended right arms were brought down. The stiff-armed salute was for other people, in countries far away. It was purely symbolic, of course, but symbols are powerful. Over the years, there have been various disputes about the Pledge of Allegiance, the most basic of which is the question of whether citizens should even be expected to publicly pledge their allegiance to their country. The United States was founded on ideals of freedom, and freedom includes not being forced, or cajoled by peer pressure, into publicly declaring any belief. The exact wording of the Pledge has changed several times since Francis Bellamy wrote it; each change was reflective of contemporaneous concerns about the meaning. For example: ""I pledge allegiance to the flag"" was originally ""I pledge allegiance to my flag."" The ""my"" was dropped out of worries that recent arrivals from other nations might be seen as pledging their loyalty to the flag of the country of their birth. The most significant change in the wording came in 1954, when -- with the enthusiastic support of President Dwight D. Eisenhower -- the phrase ""under God"" was added just after ""one nation.""  Eisenhower declared: ""In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource in peace and war."" The wording of the Pledge of Allegiance may or may not be changed again in centuries to come, but it's a pretty safe bet that the Bellamy Salute is never coming back. Once ubiquitous and unquestioned, it has become a faded and mostly forgotten bit of U.S. history. All because, 71 Decembers ago, a solution to a quandary -- a quandary no one could have anticipated when the Pledge was written -- was formalized: . Lower those stiff arms. Bend those elbows. Direct those palms inward. And take them to heart.","After the Pledge of Allegiance was written, a stiff-armed salute was developed to accompany it .

"Carles Puyol is poised to miss Spain's defense of their European Championship crown after Barcelona confirmed their captain will be out for six weeks with a knee injury. The 34-year-old felt pain in his knee after his side's 4-0 victory in the Barcelona derby against Espanyol on Saturday -- a game in which he scored. The Catalan club have confirmed Puyol will undergo surgery to correct the problem and as a result he will miss the Copa Del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao on May 25. That match also represents coach Pep Guardiola's last game in charge of the club after he, together with Puyol as skipper, led Barcelona to an unprecedented 13 trophies in his four-year tenure. A statement on the club's official website read: ""Carles Puyol will not be featuring in the Copa del Rey Final on May 25. ""The Medical Services have announced that the player ended the game on Saturday against Espanyol feeling pain in his right knee. ""'Following complementary tests, we have decided to subject the player to arthroscopy next Saturday May 12,' they said. ""The surgery will be directed by Doctor Ramon Cugat. The Catalan is expected to need about six weeks to recover."" With Spain's opening game of Euro 2012 coming against Italy on June 10, it means coach Vicente del Bosque could be without one of his stalwarts for the tournament. Puyol will be a big loss for Spain. He played all but seven minutes of their successful 2010 World Cup campaign in South Africa and scored the winner in his country's semifinal victory over Germany. He played the full 120 minutes in the final against Netherlands as Spain won soccer's biggest prize for the first time in their history. Two years prior to that, Puyol was also an integral part of the Spanish team that won the European Championships in Austria and Switzerland.","Barcelona defender Carles Puyol is set to miss Spain's Euro 2012 campaign .

"Ester Levanon rejects the notion of ""having it all."" The head of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange says women should do whatever feels right for them, not what society thinks is best. ""I don't believe I have to prove to the world that I am a success only because I have a husband and two children and two grandchildren,"" says Levanon, who split childcare with her husband while head of the Israeli Security Service's computer division. ""That's me, that's my life, that's what I wanted to do."" After graduating from Hebrew University with a Masters in math, Levanon was was scouted to join the Israeli Security Service (Shin Bet) in 1973 while working at a software company. The service was in the early stages of computerization, and Levanon, whose brother was killed in the Yom Kippur war, wanted to do something ""more than just work."" ""It really appealed to me, because I felt I could serve my country,"" she says. She spent 12 years with the service, initially as a consultant, but eventually launching its IT division. She says being the first and only female manager at the Israeli Security Service was not as difficult as convincing the organization that it needed to adopt new technology. ""They knew absolutely nothing about IT,"" she recalls. ""More than that, they really hated the idea."" Levanon also brought wide-sweeping technology adoption to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, which she joined as Chief Information Officer in 1986 before becoming CEO in 2006. The exchange, which includes more than 600 companies -- more than 50 dual-listed on the NASDAQ -- now offers automated trading, clearing and settlement. In January, it was one of several Israeli businesses attacked by hackers, who managed to crash the exchange's website, although not its trading system. In 2010, the exchange was upgraded from emerging to developed market status by index provider MSCI Inc and this year also topped Bloomberg's Riskless Return Rankings of developed markets. Here, the 65-year-old tells CNN about Israel's tight-knit business community, the sector she's most excited by, and what she's learned about children. On ""having it all"" ... It's pure nonsense. I don't know the meaning of 'have it all.' Everyone should have what they would like to have. If someone becomes a manager and she doesn't have a family, I don't think that she doesn't have it all. Maybe that's the way she likes things. (People) should do what they believe is right, not what society believes is right for them. More from Leading Women: Female racer's lessons from life in the fast lane . On childcare ... My husband and I split the responsibility, and we were helped by other people from time to time. We both managed to have careers. But that was so uncommon at the time that, at first, I pitied myself and said ""I'm working harder and look at the men!"" And then, I realized that he's paying a higher price. I don't believe he looked at it as a sacrifice. That's the life we built together and it was very natural. Each couple builds its own life; that's what we did. When (my sons) were 10 and 12, one of them complained that all of his friends come back (from school) knowing they have their mothers at home. Why am I not there? His brother told him, ""If she wants to succeed and have a better job, she must work harder."" I found out two things about children. First of all, they will always complain. If the mother is always home, they will complain. If she's not at home, they will complain. Second, I believe that my sons are very proud of what I achieve. I have to tell you that one time I stayed at home for one week and they went crazy. I started playing mother, asking them all kinds of questions I never asked. They wanted me out of the house. On Israel ... In about 64 years, we managed to come from nothing to being a developed market. Israelis are hard workers and they invest a lot. When you don't have natural resources, you need brain resources, and that's how the hi-tech community and the biotech community came to life. One of the things you see in Israel is everyone knows everyone. So, if you are looking for someone bright, you either met him during your army service or someone knows someone. They say you need three contacts to know anyone in the world -- in Israel, you need one. On the Eurozone ... What should happen is that the citizens will realize that they have to pay in order to bring Greece back to what it used to be and what it should be. As long as they are not willing to pay the price, everyone has a problem. I wish I knew what the solution is. That would make me a hero. But we probably will all have to be patient.

On being the Israeli Security Service's first female manager ... They always treated me as an equal, but they also told me I am not an example. It doesn't mean that now they believe that women can do it. I never knew whether to treat that as a compliment or an insult.

"The parents of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas for more than five years, left their protest tent outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office Wednesday, thanking their supporters before heading home. ""Our happiness will be filled with concern until Gilad returns,"" his mother Aviva said, a day after Netanyahu said a deal had been made to free him in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. ""It is clear that we won't be getting back the same boy. But the best professional people in Israel will be made available to help us,"" she said after she and her husband Noam met President Shimon Peres. They did not take down the protest tent they erected more than a year ago to draw attention to their son's plight. Shalit is expected to return to Israel within a few days, Netanyahu said Tuesday night, before the Cabinet voted in emergency session 26-3 in support of the swap. All Israelis feel powerful emotions about Shalit, said Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Daniel Taub. ""He really is the child of us all,"" Taub said, noting that almost all Israelis do military service. ""Seeing Gilad coming home ... is really coming home to every family. But at the same time it's very bittersweet,"" he said, since ""every one of us in some way has been touched by terrorism."" Netanyahu said Tuesday that the government would ""return Gilad healthy and whole to his family and all of Israel."" ""The negotiations were difficult. ... We had to make difficult decisions but (the) correct one. With all the change taking place in the Middle East we did not know if a better deal or any deal would have been possible."" Netanyahu said on Twitter that the ""arduous negotiations"" brokered through Egyptian mediators resulted in a deal last Thursday and it was signed formally by Israel and the Palestinians on Tuesday. In a speech broadcast on Hamas-run Al-Quds television, exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal said the prisoner exchange will involve the release of 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including women. ""The deal will happen in two stages -- the first stage the release of 450 Palestinian prisoners, including 315 Palestinian prisoners that have one or many life sentences and the ones who are with high sentences. The second stage will include 550 Palestinian prisoners,"" he said. Hamas is the militant Palestinian movement that controls Gaza. Of the 450 Palestinian prisoners to be freed during the first stage, 110 will go to the West Bank while 40 will go abroad, according to Mark Regev, Netanyahu's spokesman. The 550 prisoners scheduled to be released during the second stage will be freed two months later, he said. According to Regev, jailed Palestinian lawmaker Marwan Barghouti is not among the prisoners Israel has agreed to release. Palestinians captured Shalit in June 2006 after tunneling into the Jewish state and attacking an Israeli army outpost. Israel immediately launched a military incursion into Gaza to rescue Shalit, then 19, but failed to free him. Since then, he has been held incommunicado by Hamas. In October 2009, Hamas released a tape of Shalit to prove he was still alive in exchange for the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails. Since then, there has been no proof of life. There have been ongoing attempts to broker a deal to release Shalit, but all had failed.","The parents of Gilad Shalit go home after Israel announces a deal to free him .

Feeling like the most exhilarating roller-coaster ride for those onboard, it is not so spectacular for those watching on the ground at the Singapore Airshow, although it is a maneuver that he and other member of the flight team need to use regularly. ""We're often in areas that you just need to get out of quickly,"" says Major Mike Pasquino, another of the four pilots of the Hickam. A steep take off and turn was used by the crew recently to escape enemy fire in Afghanistan. ""You just think about your training and nothing else in those situations,"" says Pasquino. Part of the U.S. Air Force's Pacific crew based in Hawaii, the Hickam's other less hazardous missions have included transporting dolphins and even a killer whale in the plane's voluminous cargo hold. It's been joined in Singapore by display teams from the home nation, Australia and Malaysia, but with all those Type A personalities looping through the skies in national colors, does it lead to competition among pilots? ""No way,"" says Lieutenant Colonel Mior Nor Badrishah, commanding officer of the Malaysian Air Force's Smokey Bandits display team. ""Shit happens if you push it."" Battle for the skies at Singapore Airshow . And he should know. Badrishah gained the nickname ""Ghost"" after a near-fatal training accident over the Malacca Straits. He and other pilots from the Malaysian Air Force were on training maneuvers with the Royal Australian Air Force when an Australian jet clipped Badrishah's Russian-made Mig 29, forcing him to bail out at 13,000 feet from the burning jet. ""I blacked out for a few seconds when I ejected. I came to and pulled the parachute and landed in the water. It took over four hours for them to get me out."" Test your aviation knowledge . Just two years ago at the same event in Singapore a South Korean pilot was forced to cut short his aerial display after getting too close to the crowd. The organizers emphasize the safety measures in place at these displays, but accidents do happen, most tragically at an event in Ukraine in 2002 when 77 people died and hundreds of people were injured. Badrishah's accident ""was an expensive mistake,"" he says with heavy understatement, but it certainly didn't put him off flying. ""I had two weeks off and was then back in a plane.""","U.S. Air Force's Pacific crew go through their paces in the C-17A .

"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado (CNN) -- Matthew Murray wrote on an Internet forum of how he hated Christians between attacks on a mission center and church on Sunday, according to Denver-area media reports. A former roommate took this photo of Matthew Murray performing in a December 14, 2002, Christmas program. ""You Christians brought this on yourselves,"" Murray wrote at 11:03 a.m. on Sunday, CNN affiliate KUSA reported on its Web site. ""I'm coming for EVERYONE soon and I WILL be armed to the @#%$ teeth and I WILL shoot to kill,"" the KUSA report quoted from the final posting. With the exception of symbols used to replace an expletive, this was the same wording used by Eric Harris in a posting before he and Dylan Klebold went on a shooting rampage at Columbine High School in 1999. The posting, under the user name ""nghtmrchld26,"" was made several hours after Murray killed two people at the Youth With a Mission Center in Arvada, Colorado, and a few hours before Murray killed two people at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs. He later died in a shootout with a church security guard.  Watch accounts of shooting victim, former bunkmate » . Five years ago, the Youth With A Mission center left Murray off a missionary trip for which he had trained. Peter Warren, director of the missionary center, said Monday that managers left Murray off the 2002 trip to Bosnia for health reasons. Joe Istre, president of Association of Former Pentecostals and administrator of the Web forum Murray used, said several of the forum's members tried to help Murray in recent months. ""He appeared to be an isolated person,"" Istre said. ""We tried to tell him to get help, to get some counseling, but he just laughed at it."" A psychologist offered to help Murray after reading a poem he posted called ""Crying all alone in pain in the nightmare of Christianity,"" KUSA reported. ""I've already been working with counselors,"" Murray replied, according to KUSA. ""I have a point to make with all this talk about psychologists and counselors 'helping people with their pain.'"" Istre said the Sunday posting was the first one that included violent threats. ""He scared a lot of people in the forum throughout the last few months with some of pretty crazy posts but never anything violent."" Istre said he was allowed to continue his postings ""because he needed to vent."" Murray also copied from the writings of Columbine  gunman Harris in another case: . ""God, I can't wait till I can kill you people. Feel no remorse, no sense of shame, I don't care if I live or die in the shoot-out. All I want to do is kill and injure as many of you ... as I can especially Christians who are to blame for most of the problems in the world."" While making the postings, Murray also sent hate mail to the mission center, the Rocky Mountain News reported. I-Report contributor Richard Werner, 34, said Monday he was a worker at the center in Arvada, Colorado, in 2002, the same time as Murray. Werner said five days before Murray was told in 2002 he could not make the Bosnia trip, Murray performed a pair of dark rock songs at a concert at the mission that made fellow workers ""pretty scared."" The performance -- which included a song by rock band Linkin Park and another that had been recorded by controversial rocker Marilyn Manson -- followed months of strange behavior, Werner said. Werner, of Balneario Camborius, Brazil, said he had a bunk near Murray's and that Murray would roll around in bed and make noises. ""He would say, 'Don't worry, I'm just talking to the voices,' "" Werner said. ""He'd say, 'Don't worry, Richard. You're a nice guy. The voices like you.' "" Werner said he instantly suspected Murray when he heard the news of Sunday's shootings. ""I turned to my wife and I said, 'I know who did it. It's Matthew,' "" he said. ""It was so obvious. ""For four months, he was sleeping right next to me. Those are the things you don't imagine, but when it happened it was so obvious."" Werner said his ""heart is crushed"" by news of the shootings. Phil Abeyta, who identified himself as Murray's uncle, read a statement from the family Monday asking for forgiveness. ""Our family cannot express the magnitude of our grief for the victims and families of this tragedy,"" he said. "" ... We cannot understand why this has happened.""

"A day after a video posted online showed him describing ""Two and a Half Men"" as ""filth"" and advising viewers to stop watching the sitcom, actor Angus T. Jones apologized to the show's cast and crew Tuesday. ""I apologize if my remarks reflect me showing indifference to and disrespect of my colleagues and a lack of appreciation of the extraordinary opportunity of which I have been blessed,"" Jones said in a statement released by his publicist. ""I never intended that."" The 19-year-old actor -- who plays Jake Harper, the CBS sitcom's ""Half"" man -- didn't detail what motivated him to make comments. ""I have been the subject of much discussion, speculation and commentary over the past 24 hours.

""Without qualification, I am grateful to and have the highest regard and respect for all of the wonderful people on Two and Half Men with whom I have worked and over the past ten years who have become an extension of my family."" It's unclear how Jones' comments could affect the show in the long run, but sources close to production told CNN that Jones will not appear in either of the two remaining episodes that the CBS sitcom will shoot before going on holiday break. The sources said both of the episodes were written well in advance of Jones' video confession, which whipped around the Web on Monday. In the video, the actor, who's been on the show since 2003, repeatedly asks viewers not to watch the sitcom. 'Two and a Half Men' actor's criticism of show shines light on Seventh-day Adventists . ""I'm on 'Two and a Half Men,' and I don't want to be on it,"" Jones said. ""You cannot be a true God-fearing person and be on a television show like that. I know I can't. I'm not OK with what I'm learning, what the Bible says, and being on that television show. You go all or nothing."" According to a statement from the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Jones joined a church in the San Fernando Valley area in June, making him one of the 1.1 million North American members of the Protestant organization. However, the church said it's not affiliated with the video clip that's gone viral online and says the online show's host is not a pastor of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Church spokesman George Johnson said the church did not have additional information about Johnson's comments but said the church was happy Jones has ""found a place in which he feels comfortable to worship and grow his faith."" Jones' comments come nearly two years after Charlie Sheen was fired from the hit sitcom after a two-week public meltdown that included attacks on the show's producer.

"(CNN) -- The last of three prisoners who escaped from Indiana State Prison earlier this month has been captured, authorities said Thursday. Lance Battreal, from left, Mark Booher and Charles Smith escaped from an Indiana prison July 12. The U.S. Marshals Service captured Mark Booher, a  murderer, around 11 a.m., said Shannon Robinson, supervisor for a marshals service fugitive task force. Booher was taken into custody without incident in a hotel room on the north side of Indianapolis, Indiana, she said. He had been sentenced in 1999 to 65 years for murder and robbery. Booher escaped on July 12 from Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, Indiana, along with Lance Battreal, a rapist, and Charles Smith, also a murderer. Battreal was serving a 50-year sentence for his convictions in 1998 for rape, criminal confinement and stalking. Smith was captured the day after the jail break about eight miles away in southwestern Michigan. Battreal was captured Tuesday at his parents' home in Rockport, Indiana. The inmates apparently escaped through underground tunnels, officials said. The prison was built around 1860, and the tunnels -- lined with brick and concrete -- carry pipe chases and sewer lines. Two of the escaped inmates had worked in the tunnels as assistants to maintenance employees, said John Schrader, spokesman for the Indiana Department of Correction.","Mark Booher, a murderer, captured in a hotel room in Indianapolis .

"More than half of the ballot boxes from last weekend's Mexican presidential election -- 54.5% -- will be individually recounted, the executive secretary of Mexico's Federal Election Institute said Wednesday. That represents 78,012 ballot boxes, Edmundo Jacobo Molina told reporters. The political parties will supervise, review and watch over the recount, which will be carried out by the election institute, he said. The announcement came as the official ballot count in Mexico's presidential elections began Wednesday and as the presumptive president-elect sought to consolidate his reported victory even as a challenger refused to concede. Enrique Peña Nieto received the most votes, according to preliminary results released the night of Sunday's balloting, and according to a quick count released by the election institute, known by its Spanish acronym IFE. The quick count gave Peña Nieto a margin of victory of between 6.07 and 7.65 percentage points. But Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the candidate for a progressive coalition, has said he has evidence of irregularities at most of the 143,000 polling stations and wants a full recount. Lopez Obrador demands recount in Mexican election vote . Lopez Obrador made a similar demand after losing in 2006 to Felipe Calderon. The process that started Wednesday is intended to check all election returns recorded in each district and can carry out recounts in certain cases. IFE predicted a final count on Sunday. Officials have called this election the most transparent in Mexico's history. It was the first election in which scanned copies of district-by-district election returns were posted on the Internet. But accusations have arisen of electoral manipulation by Peña Nieto's party -- the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The party, which was in power for 71 years before being voted out in 2000, was known for being corrupt and authoritarian. Its apparent victory last weekend would mark a triumphant return after 12 years of rule by the right-wing National Action Party, known by the acronym PAN. But supporters of Lopez Obrador accused the PRI of having returned to its old ways of corruption. Political tensions flare after Mexican presidential vote . Daniel Avila, a representative for the anti-Peña Nieto student movement #YoSoy132 (I am 132), told CNN en Español that his group had already received 1,100 allegations of vote-buying, stuffed ballot boxes and intimidation. The group has photos, video and audio proof of these violations, the group said. ""What we're going to try to do is find all these people to get testimonies, and then take that evidence to the IFE,"" Avila said. Lopez Obrador supporters pointed to long lines that were reported at the Soriana chain of supermarkets. Voters flocked to the stores to use gift cards handed out by the PRI in exchange for votes, some allege. Calls to PRI offices were not returned. Mexican election regulators said they were investigating the allegations related to the gift cards. The electoral authorities should question the owners of the chain, said Irma Erendira Sandoval, a political analyst at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Wednesday's count will help determine whether there was fraud, she said. ""This is a fundamental stage where the transparency and cleanliness of the entire election is at stake,"" she told CNN en Español. According to the group Alianza Civica (Civic Alliance), which seeks to ensure elections are free and fair, a poll of Mexican voters found that nearly 30% reported being exposed to at least one example of vote-buying or coercion. Taking advantage of the fact that election returns are available online, critics began circulating copies of what they described as suspicious returns. One such document shared by PRI opponents is an electoral return from a district in Michoacan. It appears to show that 362 of 732 registered voters cast ballots, but that the PRI won 945 votes. For his part, Peña Nieto, in an interview with ""NewsHour"" on PBS, praised Mexico's democratic system and said he was putting his trust in the electoral authorities. ""We have electoral tribunals that will be responsible for addressing these issues and attending to these complaints, the ones filed by candidate Lopez Obrador,"" he said. Ballots will be recounted in cases where the difference between the top two finishers is 1 percentage point or less; where the number of annulled votes is greater than the difference between the top two; where all the votes go to one party; and where there are obvious irregularities such as the votes not adding up. Lopez Obrador must wait until Sunday to formally submit any application for a recount to the Federal Election Tribunal. Avila, the youth activist, acknowledged that Peña Nieto will likely be confirmed as president, but contended that that was because of PRI's alleged maneuverings. ""The amount of evidence we present does not matter. It is a fact that Enrique Peña Nieto will remain,"" he said. ""We have had a position since before the election that this was being imposed by fraud, and it's what we've been seeing."" Opinion: Is Peña Nieto good news for Mexico?","The political parties will supervise, review and watch over the recount, IFE chief says .

"Washington (CNN)Bernie Sanders is well aware that if he runs for president in 2016 -- a decision he says he will announce by March -- he will face a monumental challenge. He isn't a registered Democrat, but would be vying for the party's presidential nomination. He doesn't have much name recognition, but would be likely going up against the uber-recognizable Hillary Clinton. And as of late, it doesn't even seem like he has the support of his base. Liberal group MoveOn.Org ready to kick-off $1 million campaign . In the last few months, the liberal activists inside the Democratic Party have been organizing around the possibility of a long-shot presidential run by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, not Sanders' seemingly more likely run. Liberal groups have been pining for a Warren run for months and on Tuesday, a coalition of groups announced they would kick off their efforts in New Hampshire with a rally and plans to open local offices. This comes despite the fact Warren bluntly said ""no"" when asked if she was running in 2016. Sanders' hope, although he is somewhat loathe to admit it, is that he will someday get that same support. ""Obviously one would hope one would have as much support as possible from all walks of life,"" he said on Tuesday when asked why he thinks those groups aren't rallying around him. ""I am a great fan of Elizabeth and as for what people do and why they don't do it, I am not going to speculate."" Ben Wikler, the Washington Director of Move On, said that although MoveOn members have ""enormous respect for Bernie Sanders,"" it is Warren who is ""on fire."" With a new knee, Webb's still considering 2016 plans . ""Sen. Warren is perfectly in tune with this moment in history and her message, which has been a consistent, singularly focused message ... resonates with an almost electric energy,"" Wikler said. A source at MoveOn, however, was more blunt in their assessment of why Warren over Sanders. ""You can see when the needle breaks the gauge,"" the source said. ""It happens with Warren. It happens with Warren in a way that it doesn't happen with anyone else right now."" This is a problem for Sanders: The people he could once rely on -- liberal organizers -- have found someone else to support. ""If we can't do that,"" Sanders said on invigorating the grassroots to get around him, ""then I am not going to [run]."" Campaign should focus on issues, not personality . Sanders is the most serious progressive candidate actively entertaining a run at the presidency in 2016. He has taken a number of trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, two presidential mainstays, and regularly speaks at liberal conferences across the country. On Tuesday, in an editorial board meeting with CNN, he reiterated that he was strongly considering a run as either a Democrat or a independent. But that is about all he was interested in talking about regarding 2016. Torture report splits 2016 Democrats . ""Ten minutes into this discussion and no one has asked me about any of the major issues facing this country,"" Sanders said after a group of CNN producers and reporters peppered him with questions about the race, Hillary Clinton and his prospects for running. ""[I have] no intention of taking on Hillary Clinton, that is not the issue, that is the wrong question,"" he said. ""I am not taking on Hillary Clinton. I am taking on the issues."" To Sanders, elections should be more simplified. Candidates outline where they stand on complex issues, devoid of personality politics and poll questions about who Americans would rather have a beer with. A number of times in the hour, Sanders -- a senator who has come to be known as much for his fly-away hair as his passionate speeches in the Senate -- bluntly lamented the way political journalism in the United States focuses on personality as it does. ""I think this is not about personality,"" Sanders said, raising his Vermonter-by-way-of-New York voice. ""I am not a singer, I am not a dancer, I am not an entertainer."" These 2016 long-shots think they can win? Sanders would rather have voters know his policies, than his favorite vacation destination or his childhood icons. In Sander's view, it was personality -- not policy -- that elected former President George W. Bush, someone the independent says was a ""very nice guy ... but the worst president this country has had."" ""I think the media, and I have to throw this back at you guys, makes it too easy to cover my grandchildren,"" he said. ""Or Mitt Romney's dog riding on the top of his car. Very interesting, but it is not important.""","Bernie Sanders needs the liberal grassroots to rally around a prospective presidential bid .

"The lavish architecture and endless culture which is St. Petersburg may be the creation of Tsar Peter the Great in the 18th Century, but the city is Vladimir Putin's hometown. This is where he welcomes political and business leaders to the annual ""Davos of Russia,"" filled with Putin's political and corporate leaders and the who's who of global business. At Friday afternoon's plenary, the main event each year,  the first few rows were filled with the leaders from GE, BP, Shell, Alcoa, Siemens and ENI mixed in with their Russian counterparts. This is the annual festival of Russian deal making, on the Neva River. See also: Vladimir Putin fast facts . This year, President Putin invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to share the stage. There was a 45 minute question and answer session following their speeches, which I chaired. The Russian President spelled out his economic blueprint for what many refer to as ""Putin 2.0"": his second stint as President.  Sluggish growth projected by the World Bank to be less than 2.5% is forcing him to be bolder and be less dependent on oil prices which are softening. He will tap the country's sovereign funds to build out road and rail networks.  He is capping revenue increases and tariffs for the Russian state run monopolies at the rate of inflation. Putin also singled out his new central bank Governor, Elvira Nubiulliana, who takes over the job Monday.  The President has heard the complaints from Russian oligarchs that interest rates of 8.25%  are too high and that he needs to create conditions to stem capital flight. Chancellor Merkel, as can be expected, took a no nonsense approach in her formal remarks.  She admitted trust was eroded in the eurozone and that a policy of growth and sound fiscal policies must be pursued no matter how painful. But it was the candor and body language during our interview session -- and  the steely resolve of both leaders -- that captured the standing room only audience. I asked President Putin if the so-called Geneva II talks could take place in a climate where Russia continues to sell arms to the al-Assad government and the U.S. has chosen to back rebels. ""If the United States and the State Department recognize that one of the key opposition organizations al-Nusra is a terrorist organization officially recognized as terrorist which is linked to al Qaeda, how can they give weapons to that part of the opposition?"" he said. Putin added: ""We believe that our position is well founded ... we believe only the Syrian people themselves can guarantee a long-term solution."" The German Chancellor jumped in off the back of her Russian counterpart to say after tough and at times divisive discussions at the G8, in Northern Ireland, there was an opportunity now to end the suffering. See also: So what did the G8 meetings accomplish? Germany has been often been criticized for putting economic competitiveness above all else and for shying away from foreign policy.  That was not case in our plenary. I asked why she has made a move to block EU accession talks for Turkey, coming on the heels of intense protests in Istanbul and Ankara. To which the Chancellor replied: ""The values we share in Europe are essential, crucial to us and I think that what has happened in Turkey is disproportionate."" She added: ""Next week there will be a discussion and I don't want to pre-empt the German position, but I have some degree of skepticism."" Merkel underlined this also has to do with the so-called Ankara protocol, which covers the negotiations and progress made by Turkey in this process. However, she added, ""I was shocked to see how authorities dealt with demonstrators."" It was clear, despite having not seen eye-to-eye on many issues in the past, that the President and the Chancellor were eager to re-boot business relations whether it is natural gas going to Germany or high speed trains being sent to Russia. Having been accused of raising his voice during talks with his European counterparts, President Putin at one point whispered a reply into the microphone to illustrate his willingness to cooperate.

"Fashion Week has begun in New York, but for space enthusiasts, the most exciting glamor shots are coming from Mars. The much-celebrated rover Curiosity has so far strutted 109 meters (358 feet) on the surface of the Red Planet, according to its odometer, and she's looking great, NASA scientists say. The 2000-pound SUV-sized rover has been on the surface of Mars for about one month, and operating as expected. ""There have been no significant anomalies or wild cards thrown in where the performance on Mars differed significantly from the Earth,"" said Michael Watkins, Curiosity mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at a news briefing Thursday. ""That's a real testament to the engineers that developed the system."" A new photo from the rover's camera on the mast shows off the rover's arm against the spectacular Martian landscape. On the arm is the MAHLI camera, with resolution so great that it can resolve down to the grain of talcum powder, said Aileen Yingst at Thursday's NASA news briefing. Yingst is the deputy principal investigator for Curiosity's Mars Hand Lens Imager at the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson. All that separated this camera's lens from the Martian environment was a dust cover, which appears to be intact. That means even higher-resolution images from the Red Planet may come through soon. ""We're just completely and totally enthralled and excited by this image,"" Yingst said. What we've done on Mars, and what's next . Another new photo shows the rover's tracks from its first drives on Mars, as seen from the HiRISE camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.  Scientists can get insights about how changes on the Martian surface, as dust is deposited, by examining these tracks over time.  HiRISE also took an image of the parachute and back shell that helped Curiosity arrive safely. Curiosity made a dramatic landing on August 6 in a complicated maneuver involving a large parachute and a sky crane. Scientists and fans watched the live NASA feed from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as mission specialists confirmed the touchdown. The landing site has been dubbed Bradbury Landing after science fiction author Ray Bradbury. Premiering a song -- from Mars . In the interim, researchers have been checking out the many different instruments on board Curiosity. The rover also did a test drive in August and has moved away from the landing site. Now, everything except for the arm and sampling system is already operational, scientists said. The rover is currently 82 meters (269 feet, measured as the crow flies) from Bradbury Landing. It will remain there for about another week while scientists continue testing. In about a month, scientists plan to have Curiosity scoop up some Martian material. Because the rover is taking images as it goes, planners can determine whether it's making progress and how much slippage there is. It appears that there is very little slippage going on, Watkins said. How driving a rover works: Meet Scott Maxwell . Curiosity's next destination is Glenelg, a site with three types of terrain, including layered bedrock, that may be a prime target for drilling. Ultimately, the rover will end up at Mount Sharp, about 3 miles high and composed of hundreds of layers of rock that built up over time. As the rover climbs, it will sample different layers to investigate signs that life could have once existed on Mars.

"(CNN)I won't take it personally if you yawn while reading this story. Chances are you're sleep deprived. Sleep deprivation is such a rampant problem that last year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called insufficient sleep a public health epidemic. Teenagers may be suffering the most. Researchers at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health called the problem ""The Great Sleep Recession"" in a new study published in the journal Pediatrics. They surveyed more than 270,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades between 1991 and 2012 and found teens are getting less and less sleep. The average amount is seven hours a day, which is two hours less than the nine hours they should be snoozing. African-American and Hispanic boys are the least likely to sleep enough. But why? Katherine W. Keyes, lead researcher and assistant professor of epidemiology at Mailman, says researchers don't know. She and her team speculate that increased Internet and social media use is a factor as well as pressure and competition over the college admissions process. Not everyone gets all their sleep at night though. Babies and toddlers, for example, take naps to get it all in. But a new study published in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood says toddlers sleep better at night without the naps. Australian researchers reviewed 26 previously published studies and found that napping beyond age 2 is linked to poor quality sleep at night. And, as many parents of toddlers will attest to, it can also lead to an array of stalling tactics and protests at bedtime. The authors of the study say there is no scientific evidence to continue having children older than 2 nap and recommend discontinuing it, especially if the child has trouble sleeping at night. We know not getting enough sleep causes all kinds of harm to our minds and bodies no matter your age. Study after study tell us so. Sleep deprivation causes us to eat more, it shrinks our brains, is linked to Type 2 diabetes, leads to slow reaction time that can impair driving and can even cause false memories. And that list could go on and on. So how much sleep do we need? The National Sleep Foundation, recently issued new recommendations on how much sleep we should all be getting. They are based on a review of research and a consensus from a group of 18 experts in sleep, science, physiology and medicine. There are now nine age categories, some of them new. Anything more or less than the identified range is simply not recommended: . • Newborns (0 to 3 months) -- 14 to 17 hours per day . • Infants (4 to 11 months)  -- 12 to 15 hours per day . • Toddlers (1 to 2 years old) -- 11 to 14 hours per day . • Preschoolers (3 to 5 years old) -- 11 to 14 hours per day . • School age (6 to 13 years old) -- 9 to 11 hours per day . • Teens (14 to 17 years old) -- 8 to 10 hours per day . • Younger adults (18 to 25 years old) -- 7 to 9 hours per day . • Adults (26 to  64 years old) -- 7 to 9 hours per day . • Older adults (65 and older) -- 7 to 8 hours per day . While there is plenty of research confirming all that goes wrong when you don't get enough sleep, there are also proven steps people can take to help fall asleep and sleep better once they do fall asleep. A new study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine says mindful meditation helps adults fall asleep and stay asleep. Researchers at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, randomly assigned 49 adults, age 55 and older, who experienced minor sleep disturbances, to one of two groups for one year. One group was taught mindfulness meditation, which they practiced for 20 minutes per day. The other group went through sleep hygiene education intervention, which changes daily behaviors and other factors believed to be causing sleep problems. Those who used mindful meditation ended up sleeping better than those in the other group. Of course, a larger study is needed to confirm this finding. But the idea of relaxation leading to better sleep is not so far-fetched. In fact, the National Sleep Foundation recommends a relaxing bedtime ritual and winding down before bed. Meditation certainly qualifies. It also suggests waking up and going to bed at the same time every day, using bright lights to help wake up, avoiding naps and avoiding heavy meals, alcohol and cigarettes at night. It's a lot to think about. Hopefully it won't keep you up, and you'll be having sweet dreams, and enough of them, in no time.","Teens may be suffering the most from sleep deprivation, new study says .

That thought alone -- that someone would sit in a public restaurant and order dog from a menu -- is likely enough to get most ""dog people"" to stop reading this column, much less look at the photo essay featured this week by CNN's photo blog. Here in the Untied States, we will spend $58.5 billion on pets this year, according to one industry projection. We pamper dogs with Christmas presents; send them to ""doggie daycare""; bring them on planes (more than 2 million pets and animals fly per year); and trot them around show rings, judging the perfection of their pedigree. Eat them? Unthinkable. Repulsive. Cruel. We don't even consider it. The images featured on the CNN Photo Blog take viewers inside Southeast Asia's illegal dog-meat trade. Shot by Luke Duggleby, who traveled to Thailand, Laos and Vietnam for the story, they're well worth your attention. He documents a trade that is estimated to include hundreds of thousands of dogs per year. The 36-year-old was born in the U.K. and has been living in Thailand for eight years. He told me in an e-mail interview that he considers himself a ""dog person"" -- ""I got an English sheepdog for my fourth birthday and called him Tom"" -- and that made it difficult to see the gruesome realities of this trade, which is illegal in Thailand because the exporters aren't paying taxes or getting the dogs vaccinated. ""The dogs are illegally smuggled out of Thailand -- that is the illegal part,"" he said. ""They pay no tax or duty. The dogs aren't vaccinated nor do they undergo quarantine. But once they get to Laos they are legally allowed to travel ... on the way to Vietnam, as the officials aren't interested in it. And once in Vietnam no part of it is illegal."" In a slaughterhouse, ""the dogs were beaten to death in front of me,"" he said. I fear you'll see Duggleby's photos and think only one thing: How awful that people in Vietnam would eat these loveable, intelligent animals. You'll do what I did, which is to imagine your dog, or your childhood dog, in one of these cages. You won't think about the bigger picture. Which is this: The cruelty of this trade -- the fact that dogs are smashed into cages; suffocated; ""skinned alive, strung up and beaten,"" according to a CNN report -- is what should shock and sadden you. The fact that people are eating dog meat? That shouldn't. Unless you're vegetarian or vegan -- I'm not, by the way, although I do try to eat relatively little meat -- you don't have any moral high ground to stand on. Here in the United States, a place with an unhealthy and ridiculously hipster bacon obsession (witness: bacon donuts, bacon pie, bacon in bloody marys), eating dog could be seen as a reasonable alternative to pig, which is another highly intelligent animal, capable of being a companion to the likes of George Clooney. The United States euthanizes 1.2 million dogs per year, according to the ASPCA. Would eating them be so different? It actually could be seen as helpful. ""[U]nlike all farmed meat, which requires the creation and maintenance of animals, dogs are practically begging to be eaten,"" Jonathan Safran Foer, a vegetarian and novelist, writes in the book ""Eating Animals."" Euthanizing pets, he says, ""amounts to millions of pounds of meat now being thrown away every year. The simple disposal of these euthanized dogs is an enormous ecological and economic problem. It would be demented to yank pets from homes. But eating those strays, those runaways, those not-quite-cute-enough-to-take and not-quite-well-behaved-enough-to-keep dogs would be killing a flock of birds with one stone and eating it, too."" But wait: Dogs are companions, right? Pigs (mostly) are not. True, in America. In parts of Vietnam, not so much. In India, remember, cows are sacred. And eating pig is off limits for many Muslim and Jewish people. Plus, there's an inherent danger in thinking that ""the value of an animal depends on how you treat it,"" writes Slate's William Saletan. ""If you befriend it, it's a friend. If you raise it for food, it's food,"" he says in a 2002 essay, hilariously titled ""Wok the Dog."" ""This relativism is more dangerous than the absolutism of vegetarians or even of thoughtful carnivores. You can abstain from meat because you believe that the mental capacity of animals is too close to that of humans. You can eat meat because you believe that it isn't. Either way, you're using a fixed standard. But if you refuse to eat only the meat of 'companion' animals -- chewing bacon, for example, while telling Koreans that they can't stew Dalmatians -- you're saying that the morality of killing depends on habit or even whim."" Maybe the logic of that makes sense but the thought of eating dog still doesn't sit well. That's the case for me. I went to Vietnam earlier this year to report a story on the illegal trade in pangolin, which is a scale-covered mammal few people care about (except me and maybe this guy) in the way they care about dogs. I saw dog restaurants in Hanoi. Easily could have gone to one. I didn't. And that says less about the dog-eating that's going on in Hanoi than my own conflicted eating habits. Clearly, the illegal dog trade needs to be cleaned up. But so does our thinking about what we eat and when and why. If we're appalled by the dog trade in Southeast Asia, we should be similarly appalled by some of the conditions that exist in factory animal farms in the United States -- including the use of ""gestation crates"" to confine mother pigs, a practice activist Temple Grandin has criticized, saying it's like ""asking a sow to live in an airline seat."" If we think dog shouldn't be eaten -- like, ever, regardless of how clean the trade is and how quick the kill -- then maybe we should think about the other animals we eat, and if and why we don't feel the same way about them. Is it because we spend so much time with dogs -- looking into their eyes, talking to them, walking them, picking up their crap -- that we understand that they are living, breathing, feeling beings? Would we feel that way about other animals if we could hang out more? Or would the beak-y, frowny face of the chicken still stop us short of empathy? For his part, Duggleby, the photographer who shot the dog story, told me he was offered dog meat on the assignment but couldn't eat it. ""When I was photographing inside a dog meat restaurant -- claiming to be a chef studying Vietnamese food -- I was offered to try it,"" he said. ""It probably looked very odd for a 'chef' to say no but I turned it down. I just couldn't bring myself to try it."" I likely would have done the same thing. Exactly why? That's a harder question. And it's the one all of us should further examine.","CNN's photo blog features an essay on the illegal dog-meat trade in Southeast Asia .

"Erin and William Petersen almost didn't get the ultrasound. You don't really need it, the doctor told them, but come on in if you like and have a look at your baby. They watched excitedly as the baby, just 12 weeks old, moved its hand across the screen. It looked like a wave hello to Mommy and Daddy. Excuse me, the technician said as she put down the ultrasound wand and headed toward the door. ""Is everything OK?"" the Petersens asked. ""No,"" the technician answered and walked out of the room. Sky-high rate of a birth defect . Nearly two years after the state of Washington was alerted to a possible cluster of babies born with severe birth defects, experts are speaking out, criticizing the state health department for not doing enough to save babies' lives. For four years in a row, from 2010 through 2013, the rate of babies born with a brain defect called anencephaly -- a type of neural tube defect -- in one rural area of Washington has been more than four times the national rate. The defect is always fatal. The Washington Department of Health has steadfastly refused to interview the parents of these babies and has failed to accept offers of help from world-renowned anencephaly experts. ""It really looks like they're dragging their feet,"" said Richard Finnell, a pediatric geneticist and birth defect expert at the University of Texas. He said that to find the cause of the cluster, state investigators need to speak with the parents of children with birth defects in the three-county area to see whether they might have something in common. But the state has not contacted these parents. ""This is the highest rate of anencephaly since a cluster in Texas back in the '90s, and they should get in there and figure it out. But they don't seem very excited about it,"" Finnell said. That Texas outbreak was found to be associated with moldy corn consumed by the mothers. A team of experts on this mold offered help to Washington investigators back in February but hasn't received a response. ""We're frustrated that they're not moving more quickly to find the cause,"" said Janee Gelineau-van Waes, one of the mold experts and an associate professor of pharmacology at the Creighton University School of Medicine in Nebraska. The Washington Department of Health has defended its response to the high rate, pointing out that it did a review of the mothers' medical records and, this month, created an advisory committee to help with the investigation. A state epidemiologist, Juliet VanEenwyk, said that at some point, investigators hope to work with the mold experts. If all of that isn't enough of a response, that's partly because the state's epidemiologists believe the increased rate could be random, VanEenwyk said. Though it is indeed high, the number of anencephaly cases is so small  -- 8.7 per 10,000 births -- that next year, the rate could be back in line with the rest of the country. The national rate is 2.1 cases per 10,000 live births. ""Clusters come and go,"" said VanEenwyk. ""This could possibly be a statistical blip."" But Finnell and others say they think a fourfold increase is no blip. With anencephaly, the baby is born without a fully formed brain. There's no chance of survival. Research has suggested that pregnant women are at higher risk of neural tube defects if their intake of folic acid is low before and during pregnancy. The United States has seen a 27% drop in such case since it started fortifying grains with folic acid. 'The lamest excuse I've ever heard' When the ultrasound tech walked out the door, the Petersens were left alone, Erin's stomach still exposed with the ultrasound gel on it. ""It's OK,"" her husband kept repeating, but Erin couldn't even look at him. She just stared at the wall, listening to the sound of her own heart beating louder and louder. The tech returned with the doctor. ""He told us our baby had anencephaly and had no chance of survival. He was surprised he'd made it this long,"" Erin said. ""He went to the computer and brought up a picture of a deceased baby with anencephaly, and there was no skull past the eyebrows. It was horrifying. The image is seared into my head forever."" The Petersens scheduled a pregnancy termination for two days later, on June 30, 2012.  In the meantime, they went home to wait. ""I was inconsolable,"" Erin said. ""I had a baby inside me that was living, and his heart was beating, but I knew I would have to say goodbye in a couple of days."" The day before the termination, Billy Petersen found a red marker and drew a heart on his wife's stomach. ""I knew our baby was in there, and I was showing him that I love him,"" he said. ""It was our last night with him."" This kind of emotion is one of the reasons why the Department of Health has decided so far not to interview families like the Petersens. ""It's very intrusive to start knocking on doors of people who've had a pretty major trauma in their lives,"" VanEenwyk said. ""That's the lamest excuse I've ever heard,"" said Billy Petersen, reflecting the viewpoint of several families interviewed by CNN whose children have neural tube defects. ""We want to talk to them,"" he said. ""We'd do anything to help find out why our baby died and help other families. We don't want anyone else to go through what we've been through."" VanEenwyk said it's not clear what investigators would ask these parents. The medical records review showed they had nothing obvious in common. ""Unless we really think we're going to learn something that will help us prevent neural tube defects, we've said that that's not the route to go yet."" All the Petersens can do now is grieve without answers. A few weeks after they terminated the pregnancy, the couple found outthat  their baby had been a boy. They named him Oliver Michael and got tattoos in his memory. Billy's tattoo on his collarbone has a baby's hand and the letters AIMH, for ""Always in my Heart."" Erin's tattoo on the inside of her wrist has the same baby hand. ""Godspeed,"" it reads. ""Sweet dreams.""","Anencephaly is a fatal brain defect .

"There's a movement under way among dads in America that's changing what you see on TV. Across the country, more and more are fed up -- and rising up against the stereotype of the inept, clueless father. ""We're not the Peter Griffin or the Homer Simpson that we're often portrayed as,"" said Kevin Metzger, who runs the Dadvocate blog. It's often the chief gripe among the dads I interview about modern fatherhood. David Holland, father of three, rails against ""doofus dads"" in ads.  In his blog Blather. Wince. Repeat., he calls them ""Madison Avenue's go-to guy."" During every commercial break, he says, he and his wife ""try to see who can be the first one to spot the idiot husband or father."" In a sign of their growing power, dads out to end the stereotype recently scored a knockout blow against a pair of TV ads. A Huggies ad earlier this year said the company put its diapers ""to the toughest test imaginable: dads, alone with their babies, in one house, for five days."" What exactly made time with dad ""the toughest test imaginable?""  The ad showed dads making some unpleasant faces and ended with a woman saying, ""good luck, babe."" Another Huggies ad featured a group of dads not changing their babies' diapers while watching an entire game through ""double overtime."" Angry dads and moms responded with complaints, saying fathers aren't incompetent parents who leave their kids in dirty diapers. Chris Routly took it a step further, creating a petition on change.org. ""This wasn't just that they had created a bumbling dad character or that sort of thing or just excluding dad,"" like so many other TV portrayals, he said.  ""They were using language that was really saying dads are terrible at this stuff."" Huggies took action. On Facebook, the company praised dads and said its intention was to ""break out of stereotypes."" And Huggies officials called Routly, giving him a list of steps they were taking to show fathers in a better light. Soon, Huggies issued new ads featuring dads caring for their toddlers.  Last month, the NYC Dads Group heaped praise on them for ""raising the bar"" in how a father was portrayed. Huggies isn't the first to run into frustration from consumers rejecting what they view as an outdated, inaccurate trope.  AT&T angered some with an ad about a father who somehow couldn't wrap his mind around the concept of wireless Internet. The image of the hapless dad has long roots in American pop culture.  A study of comics as far back as the 1940s found ""incompetent"" fathers and other mocking portrayals resurging at times across the decades. But TV didn't start skewering dads frequently until much later, says Bob Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. While dads in ""Leave It to Beaver"" and ""The Donna Reed Show"" had flaws, they were close to what was then thought of as ""perfect,"" part of an idealized white American family.  Later, shows such as ""The Cosby Show,"" ""Family Ties,"" ""Growing Pains"" and ""Full House"" showcased caring dads of a new generation, Thompson says. But by the late 1980s, more shows wanted to distance themselves ""from the corny, syrupy stuff"" -- and in stepped shows such as ""Married With Children"" and ""The Simpsons."" It's only natural that comedies would take on dads, Thompson says. ""Comedy is about inversion -- taking people who are in authority and control and making them the butt of jokes.""  So in a society ""that has been so dominated by men... comedy is naturally going to play against that."" Dads on TV today are presented in so many different ways that it's impossible to say things are getting better or worse, he says. From the stay-at-home dad in ""Up All Night"" to the lovable dads in ""Modern Family,"" relatively positive portrayals abound.  Thompson says the growing push for ""recognizable"" dads who reflect today's realities are probably to credit for these characters. Meanwhile, dramas such as ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Mad Men"" show such bad fathers that ""you'd beg social services"" to put their children in a foster home with Al Bundy, he jokes. Plus, thanks to modern media, people now can always create their own videos about dads and, sometimes, watch them go viral. To some, the idea that anyone would be upset over this stereotype is ridiculous. Huggies' Facebook page has hundreds of posts from women and men saying they found the original ads funny.  ""The problem these days is everyone has lost their sense of humor,"" Christine Lee wrote. And every group of people -- including moms -- gets caricatured and stereotyped on TV. Do some dads just need to lighten up? No, says Chris Routly. There's a growing rejection of stereotypes in general -- and that should apply to dads as well, he argues. He's also concerned that boys and men ""see the bumbling dad ... and think that's what's expected of them,"" the stay-at-home father of two told me by phone while baking chips for his kids out of kale from his garden.  ""They're not expected to be good, so they rise to the low bar that's set for them."" And it can lead girls and women to have low expectations for how their husbands will handle fatherhood, he says. Part of the problem, Routly says, is that a lot of people believe negative stereotypes really apply to far more dads than they do. I ran into that myself last year.  A column on CNN.com by a stay-at-home father complained that ""most"" dads ""just wanna chill in front of SportsCenter with a bowl of chips"" after work and complain to their stay-at-home wives about how hard they work.  On his blog, the writer railed against the ""millions of dads who view their days at home as recovery from work."" I responded with a long list of studies showing how well dads are actually doing, including this from Pew Research: ""Almost all fathers who live with their children take an active role in their day-to-day lives through activities such as sharing meals, helping with homework and playing."" While by far most of the responses I received were positive, some were from angry people insisting the negative depictions must accurately describe the average dad. Routly says he received hate mail after launching his petition. ""There are people who are so invested in maintaining these kinds of roles and stereotypes that they felt like they needed to attack me."" But he also heard from men thanking him and sharing stories of custody battles and judges who assumed they weren't as good at parenting simply because they're men. While there's seriousness behind their complaints about the stereotype, these dads insist they can take a joke. ""By and large, men are willing to laugh at themselves,"" says Holland.  ""But there just becomes a point where you say, 'OK, the first 400 of these were funny.' "" And Thompson of the Bleier Center, himself a dad, says he enjoys laughing at these depictions, which exaggerate characteristics of some fathers, even today. ""As long as there are clueless bumbling men there will be clueless bumbling dads,"" he says. ""I'm sure there were clueless bumbling cavemen. Actually, his name was Fred Flintstone!""

"It was a shimmering metal wall hanging fashioned from thousands of bottle tops that won El Anatsui international acclaim. During the Venice Biennale in 2007 the Ghanaian sculptor transformed the facade of a museum by draping one of his exquisite metal tapestries over the top of it, causing a sensation in the art world. Today, he is hot property, collected by the world's major museums and selling his rippling metal installations that nod to indigenous art for hundreds of thousands of dollars. His latest work goes on display this week at New York's High Line, an elevated park built on an old freight rail line in Manhattan. ""Broken Bridge II"" will be his largest installation yet -- a 37-foot-high sculpture made of recycled pressed tin and mirrors woven together with copper wire. ""The idea of the mirrors is to bring in the landmarks of New York ... to celebrate the achievements of where the work is,"" he said. The Empire State Building is one building reflected in the sculpture. Read related: America's black cowboys fight for their place in history . El Anatsui is known for his interest in indigenous art and use of materials that he finds locally -- like the whiskey bottle caps that he uses for his tapestries -- and he puts it down to his upbringing which was cut off from traditional Ghanian culture. He was born in the small town of Anyako in the Volta region of Ghana during British rule.  The youngest of 32 children (on his father's side), his mother died when he was a baby and he was brought up in a Presbyterian Mission House by his uncle, a Presbyterian Minister. ""When you're living in a Mission House, you have everything there, you don't need to go out and therefore you don't know too much about indigenous society ... I was kind of isolated from it,"" he said. Even as a boy, he knew he wanted to be an artist: ""I had a kind of calling."" He went on to study Fine Arts at the University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, then an ""unimaginable"" thing to do. At that time, only a few years after Ghana achieved independence from the UK in 1957, the post-colonial hangover meant El Anatsui studied a British-style curriculum, only covering European art. Read related: Chinese sculptor Xiang Jing's painful search for truth . He felt strongly that he wanted to know something about his own indigenous culture. ""Having been estranged from it and exposed to art being produced in Europe and Asia, I was wondering why we didn't have art as well,"" he said. He remembers coming across a national cultural center in Kumasi and there began to discover Ghana's ""very interesting art forms."" They included ""adrinka,"" a series of ideograms or graphic symbols that represent aphorisms. It reminded El Anatsui of the European quest in science during the Renaissance to use symbols to represent abstract concepts. The similarity gave him ""quite a shock,"" and was the catalyst for his exploration of his native culture -- and his attempts to, as he puts it, ""indigenize my consciousness."" He started using materials from his local environment, recyclables like the bottle caps. ""A lot of people call them waste, but to me they are not waste ...There are people who collect these things, smash them and make them into utensils like big cooking pots,"" he said. Read related: South African rugby legend: Sport can unify a nation . The bottle tops in his flowing, shimmering installations also have a deeper meaning. He says they are meant to act as a reminder that African slaves were exchanged for European liquor during the transatlantic slave trade. While the fluidity of the sculptures are meant to reflect the unsteady relationship between Europe, Africa and America. Despite the deep affinity El Anatsui has for homegrown African culture, he resists being called an African artist. ""I don't know any (artist) who wants to be geographically categorized only. Artists want to be known only as artists,"" he says. He says that when the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York first acquired his art, it was for their African Galleries and only later for their Modern and Contemporary Art Galleries. This ""raises so many questions as to what precisely I am -- am I an African artist or an artist?"" he asks, adding it is high time museums ""revisited their categorizations."" He adds: ""An artist in India is the same as an artist in Africa, Ghana, Japan or America."" Another thing he doesn't want to be prescriptive about is how his work is hung in galleries. He sends his work out with no instructions leaving it up to the curators to decide how to install it. At first they are confused but eventually they discover ""they themselves are also artists,"" he says. ""It's a versatile form. I think an art form should be a replica of life itself -- life is not something which is cut and fixed -- it is constantly changing.""","El Anatsui is an internationally renowned Ghanaian artist who lives and works in Nigeria .

"A former CIA officer accused of disclosing classified information to reporters and lying to a review board about material in a book he wrote is expected to plead guilty to some charges on Tuesday. John Kiriakou, is scheduled to appear Tuesday morning for a change of plea hearing at U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, but the court docket on the case does not reveal the charges to which Kiriakou will admit guilt. A five-count indictment brought against Kiriakou in April included charges that he illegally identified two people to reporters: a covert intelligence officer and an analyst. The specific allegations brought by the government were one count of  violating the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, three charges under the Espionage Act for disclosing national defense information to people not authorized to receive it and one court of making false statements to a CIA review board about material in his book. One of the charges of illegally identifying a person concerned an analyst identified in the indictment as Officer B, who was involved in the 2002 operation that resulted in the capture of alleged al Qaeda terrorist Abu Zubaydah. Zubaydah is one of three detainees the CIA later admitted waterboarding during interrogations. A government report revealed the simulated drowning technique was used on him 83 times. Zubaydah has yet to be charged by the U.S. government and is incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Kiriakou worked for the CIA from 1990 to 2004. He and a co-author wrote a book, ""The Reluctant Spy: My Secret Life in the CIA's War on Terror."" According to the indictment, Kiriakou lied when he submitted a draft of the manuscript to the CIA in 2008 and claimed an investigative technique discussed in the book was fabricated. The court document quotes an e-mail Kiriakou sent to his co-author, who was not named in the indictment, which said in part, ""I said some things were fictionalized when in fact they weren't. There's no way they're going to go through years of cable traffic to see if it's fictionalized, so we might get some things through."" A CIA review board goes over all books and other writings by former or current CIA employees to guard against any disclosure of classified material. If convicted on all five charges in the original indictment, Kiriakou faces up to 45 years in prison. It is not known what sentence Kiriakou might receive in an apparent plea deal. Peter Carr, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, would not comment on Tuesday's scheduled court proceeding.

"Before Ebola, there was the flu -- the Spanish flu of  1918, which  burned rapidly through army barracks, refugee camps, troop ships, all the crowded high-risk zones that World War I created. Some people think it came out of Kansas. The first  American cases developed there. Soldiers from army camps like Fort Riley, in eastern Kansas, carried the virus to other camps around the U.S., and over the sea to France. The flu of 1918-1919 came toward the end of the First World War -- which began a century ago this year -- and it killed more people than died in that conflict, more people than the Black Death, back in the 14th century. In fact, nobody knows exactly how many people died around the world; the estimates go all the way up to 100 million, which would have been 5% of the world's population. Opinion: How a century-old war affects you . If you lost a son in uniform in 1918, you were equally likely to lose him to the flu as to enemy bullets; half of the American servicemen who died were killed by the flu. After the virus started spreading in Europe, infecting and killing people in a number of countries, it was thoroughly described in the Spanish press -- because the King of Spain got sick, and because Spain was not in the war, and therefore not censoring news, while the French, British, and German papers were suppressing anything which might have an effect on  wartime morale or suggest vulnerability.  And thus, as a prize of peace, Spain became forever connected to the most deadly pandemic of all time. Opinion: The promise World War I couldn't keep . Influenza is a seasonal illness. Every year an influenza virus emerges, generally originating somewhere in Asia, and moves through the world, causing fever and chills, muscle pain and headache, cough and runny nose, and a certain number of deaths. That's why you need to get a flu shot every fall -- it's available now and you should make sure that you get it, and doubly sure that your children do -- because the flu virus is a particularly changeable microbe, and every year the virus is a slightly different genetic mix, and the vaccine has to be tailored to protect you. Most years, most strains, influenza is especially deadly to the very young and the very old. In my pediatric clinic, we vaccinate every child starting at 6 months of age, but we take special trouble to make sure that the kids with medical problems, from asthma to congenital heart disease, get flu vaccine every year. The 1918 flu virus was different. It was deadly to young adults. The elderly, who are often the victims in flu season, did relatively well, perhaps because they had lived through a related strain of flu 30 years earlier, and therefore had some protective immunity. But people in their 20s and 30s, healthy young people, got sick in record numbers -- and many of them did not recover. Opinion: The mighty women of World War I . That same 1918 flu was unusually virulent, so a very high percentage of the people who got sick went on to die. They died because their lungs filled with fluid. They drowned, it was sometimes said, inside their own useless lungs. There are stories about how fast this influenza killed; people got sick and died within 12 hours. But the Spanish flu also looked more like a hemorrhagic fever -- that is, people died because the infection affected their ability to form blood clots and stop bleeding --so there were people coughing up blood, or bleeding from their noses or their eyes. Some victims' feet turned black from internal bleeding. Opinion: War: What is it good for? Art! In other words, the 1918 virus behaved a little like the Ebola virus, a hemorrhagic fever virus much in the news right now. This flu  raced through classrooms and schools and theaters -- and cities.  In Philadelphia in October 1918, every hospital bed was filled, and hundreds of people were dying every day. The city ran out of coffins. ""The most terrifying aspect of the epidemic was the piling up of bodies,"" John Barry writes in his book, ""The Great Influenza."" ""Undertakers, themselves sick, were overwhelmed. They had no place to put bodies. Gravediggers either were sick or refused to bury influenza victims."" Opinion: Should nations pay the price for their leaders' misdeeds? All kinds of public health measures and quarantines were tried, as the epidemic raged. Campaigns promoted face masks and targeted spitting in public with misdemeanor ordinances and fines. St. Louis closed its schools, theaters, pool halls, churches and bars, in a strategy called ""social distancing.""  New York City required businesses to stagger their hours, so that people wouldn't be squeezed together in rush hour commutes. When the Boston schools were closed, teachers were recruited as nurses. Some towns attempted to keep the virus out altogether; Barry tells the story of Gunnison, Colorado, which blocked all incoming roads and warned railway passengers that if they stepped off the train onto the platform, they would be arrested. Opinion: How World War I gave us 'cooties' Cities also built their public health infrastructures; they opened emergency clinics, they strengthened reporting networks that tracked infectious diseases. In fact, the story of the 1918 influenza can be read -- by those who have eyes to see -- as the admittedly bloody beginning of the triumph of modern medicine, public health and scientific microbiology. But none of that is what saved us, not the development of a vaccine. We were saved because, as it does every year, the flu epidemic receded. Maybe that intensely virulent strain of influenza virus was replaced, over time, by a less virulent strain. And the annual influenza story became a largely pro forma public health story: Viral strain identified, vaccine manufactured, full speed ahead!  Get your flu shots! Opinion: The 'bionic men' of World War I . In 1918, a virus that was unusually devastating to the young and healthy came into a world which, paradoxically, had marshaled many of its young healthy citizens for military purposes. So the First World War shaped the epidemic, and the epidemic, in turn, affected the war. Most famously, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson came down with influenza while attending the Paris Peace Conference and had to miss days of the negotiations that ultimately resulted in the Treaty of Versailles. Every epidemic is a product of microbiology and sociology; we look at Ebola now and worry about an epidemic which can spread by mass air travel in an interconnected world, which circumvents some of our modern medical precautions. Opinion: How World War I gave us drones . But the important lessons from the 1918 epidemic are probably not specific to the virus -- or rather, they would argue for looking closely at any contagious illness and thinking carefully about true risk and true benefit. How is the virus actually transmitted, when does it make sense to practice social distancing, to institute quarantines, to close the schools and the pool halls and the churches? We have microbiological knowledge that the good people of 1918 did not possess; we have antiviral drugs and disposable personal protective equipment to be put on by everyone working with patients at risk. That should make us at once more fearful -- because yes, indeed, the world as we know it may end because of new and terrifying infectious agents -- and more sanguine -- because yes, we live in a world of microbes. They live on us, and in us, and sometimes we travel together into darkness. Opinion: When chemical weapons killed 90,000 . Nothing will ever take away the threat of a new and virulent microbe. But we have learned a lot about building institutions to help us protect ourselves and the people we love, about public health and common sense. In other words, stop worrying about Ebola, think about 1918, wash your hands and go get that flu shot.

"(CNN)All eyes were glued to the big guy in the gym. Red-faced and sweaty, he must have been benching more than 300 pounds. But the weights were slipping. Just as it looked as if he was going to get crushed by the immense burden dangling over his head, he tossed the weights up like it was no problem at all and popped up from the bench. He may have looked down for a minute, but he would not be defeated. The gym was silent. Everyone was impressed. But the thing I noticed most as he strutted around gasping for air was his Penn State University T-shirt. ""That's right,"" I thought as I rode the elliptical machine at my local gym a few days ago. ""That's how we do. We are Penn State."" It was the first time since 2011, when the horrific Jerry Sandusky child abuse scandal was revealed, that I felt any pride or connection to my alma mater. In 2012, Sandusky, the former assistant football coach, was sentenced to 30-60 years in prison for the sexual abuse of 10 boys after tearful testimony from his victims. Since then, I've wanted no association with the school or the culture that valued winning football games above protecting children from rape. And when my son was accepted to Penn State that year, we tossed the acceptance letter in the trash. My own Penn State sweatshirt was stuffed deep in the back of the closet. I am a Nittany Lion and I was ashamed. Sadly, my new-found pride was short-lived. In an attempt to restore the university's reputation, Pennsylvania state officials led by Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman and state Treasurer Rob McCord, filed a suit against the NCAA. They wanted all sanctions the NCAA placed against the school be lifted. The NCAA had reached beyond its authority in punishing Penn State, they argued. In other words, their lawsuit had nothing to do with the boys who were raped or abused by Sandusky. It had nothing to do with the fact that head football coach Joe Paterno, who died in 2012, and others at the school had been alerted to this abuse as early as 1998 and did very little to make sure it stopped. Nope, Corman and others wanted redemption for Penn State, based on a loophole over the authority of the NCAA to punish the football program. The NCAA caved, ruling last week to restore Penn State's 112 wins wiped out during the Sandusky scandal, including the 111 wins erased from the record of head football coach Joe Paterno -- all the victories after the first time police were called by a mother reporting that Sandusky had showered with her 10-year-old son on the Penn State campus back in 1998. And the $60 million dollar fine the NCAA levied against the school? Well, now instead of the NCAA collecting the fine and spending the dollars nationally, the ruling allows the university to keep the money but commit to spending the $60 million in Pennsylvania to fund in-state child abuse programs only. Other sanctions lifted by the NCAA ruling, include ending a five-year probation period and scholarship and transfer rules. We teach our kids when they do wrong to face up to it, take their punishment without complaint or excuses and move on. Then, go out into the world and show everyone you are better than your lowest moments. It takes courage, integrity and leadership. That is what Penn State needed to do. And so, for me, this is not a proud day for Penn State. We've cheated the system, bullied our way back into the record books. And we've told the world once again that in Happy Valley winning is more important than anything. All those boys who were raped? Well, that's not our problem. What's important is making sure coach Paterno's 409-136-3 is restored. ""The whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth,"" said Mister Mann Frisby, a Penn State alum, and track coach for more than 11 years. ""The NCAA sanctions athletes for the smallest things -- you take a parent to lunch, it's a violation. You help a student-athlete pay for airfare for their parent to see a game, it's a violation. Students lose eligibility, sports programs are punished.  And now, the NCAA is lifting sanctions after boys were molested and raped on his watch and he did little or nothing to stop it. This sends a terrible message,"" said Frisby, who was the first person in his family to graduate from college. This weekend, social media is abuzz with Penn State fans applauding the NCAA decision, feeling vindicated. For many others, me included, this ruling and the reaction from the Nittany Lion Nation wipes away any bonhomie the university was gaining over the past three years. ""It is hard to believe that the NCAA and the school could take the most nauseating, the most horrifying, the most indefensible institutionalization of corruption in American sports -- the Jerry Sandusky scandal -- and make it worse, but today they just did,"" said ESPN's Keith Olbermann said on his show Friday. It seemed that the university was trying to clean up its act. Joe Paterno and university president Graham Spanier had been fired. Both of those things needed to happen.  The board of trustees had ushered in changes. The Sandusky trial ended after months of testimony almost too unbearable to watch as abuse victim after abuse victim told their painful stories about being raped and molested by Sandusky. A new coach was brought in and the team started winning. That's how healing happens; how forgiveness happens. One day at a time, trying to do better, be better than you were yesterday. There is no short cut on the road to redemption. Even coach Paterno knew that: . ""Success without honor is an unseasoned dish; it will satisfy your hunger, but it won't taste good."" -- Joe Paterno . JoePa may be back atop the record books as the ""winningest coach ever,"" but he was not an honorable man -- not when it came to putting the lives and safety of children above football. And no NCAA ruling can change that history.","Roxanne Jones: NCAA agreed to restore Penn State's wins under Joe Paterno .
She says settlement shows that university and its supporters still haven't accepted responsibility for scandal ."
"I love being spoiled by my kids, but something's missing: a chance to hug my own mother. ""Mama, what did you used to do with Grandma Heather on Mother's Day?"" asks my four-year-old as we sat down to brunch. Pause. Swallow. Breathe deeply. ""Well, we did lots of things,"" I reply. ""We were lucky to have a lot of Mother's Days with her. Sometimes we used to take her out to brunch or make her a special meal at home... Sometimes we went to a jazz concert with her, since that was one of her favorite kinds of music..."" I trail off. ""Jazz? I don't like jazz,"" he sniffs, and then turns to his dad to ask for the syrup. The moment passes without my dissolving into tears, a minor triumph for me. Parenting.com: Yummy breakfast-in-bed ideas for Mother's Day . The last Mother's Day I got to celebrate with my mom was May 10, 2009. She was in a rehabilitation center after several weeks in the hospital, following the discovery that her breast cancer had metastasized and necessitated a colostomy. Her illness aside, it was a harrowing time for our family: my husband had lost his job due to the recession; we had had to move a few hours away as a result, my toddler son was melting down regularly as his world zigged and zagged, and, to top it off, I was very, very pregnant. My mom wallowed in self-pity for a few days, thinking about how uh, crappy, it would be to have to walk around with a bag of stool taped to her stomach for the rest of her life, but did her best to clutch at her usual spunky, snarky self. She was focused on regaining the strength to climb the stairs of her townhouse in Brooklyn and hoped to make it home in time for the birth of my second son several weeks later -- which she had graciously allowed to take place in her home. On that particular Mother's Day, she was tired from everything she had been through in the previous weeks, and I was exhausted from waddling around the city as my due date loomed. While my husband and toddler went exploring in the hallways of the rehab center, my mom and I sat together, trying to enjoy our time but looking forward to better days. I gave her a card that day that read, ""I was really worried there for a bit, but I should have known that you still had some fight left in you. I am so grateful for the almost 23 years since your initial diagnosis, but I'm greedy for more time with you. You are a remarkable woman and an amazing mom -- I really do aspire to be like you and to have my kids feel about me the way that Jay [my brother] and I do you."" Little did we know what was to come. Parenting.com: My most precious Mother's Day gift . She didn't end up making it out of the rehab in time to witness her grandson's birth, but she eventually made it home a few weeks later. When her strength didn't resume as we had all expected, her oncologist paid a housecall to let us know that the cancer had spread even further, and that she should cease all treatment and start hospice care. She slipped into a coma one evening as my newborn son, Henry, and I lay beside her, and she died the next evening, with my brother and me by her side, having given us time to say our goodbyes, tell her how much we loved her, and reassure her that we would be okay. The Mother's Days since have been tinged with bittersweet longing. While I'm crazy about my boys and appreciate however they want to celebrate the day, I miss having someone to honor. Sure, I call my dad's partner and wish her a happy Mother's Day and send my favorite aunt (my mom's youngest sister) a pair of earrings much like ones I would have chosen for my mom, but there will always be something missing. Maybe it's because I was raised by a single mom, but I always felt the need to really make something of the day for her -- to show her how deeply I felt she was doing a great job. And now I also miss her vote of confidence in my parenting, since it felt like it was coming from the pro. Parenting.com: The most awkward pregnancy photos ever . I try to keep or create who she was for my boys, who didn't get to really know her. My older son, Ben, has vague memories of her (or maybe just memories of what I've told him they did together, since he only two when she died), but my younger son Henry just a few weeks old when she passed away. She was too weak to even hold him. I tell Ben of how my mom used to chuckle when I would call her nearly crying in frustration at his stubbornness; not only would she would remind me that I had been similarly temperamental, but she genuinely reveled in his strong personality. And her laughing, while maddening, helped me to better appreciate him by seeing him through someone else's eyes. When he rides his balance bike, I remind him that Grandma Heather gave it to him, somehow foreseeing that a gift that would grow with him would allow her to remain tangibly present in his life after her death. In the evening, when Henry climbs into his big brother's bed to cuddle and read before bedtime, I might ask him if he knows that he was born in that bed, his grandmother's bed and a bed that had welcomed two other generations of my family a century ago. And as my boys fall asleep, it's to the sound of my off-key rendition of lullabies she made up and used to sing to me, songs I hadn't heard or thought of in years but which began to ring in my ears after her death. And of course we keep photos of her around the house -- her house, actually, since my brother and my family and I moved back in following her death. Parenting.com: Top baby names of 2012 . Although Mother's Day is one where I can't help but feel her loss, the times I miss her most are during the highs and lows of parenting -- when one of my sons reaches a big milestone like walking or learning how to read, or at the end of a long day when I've lost my temper. It's at those moments that I wish I could hear just how proud she would be, or be reminded that having a bad day doesn't make you a mom failure. I miss her take on it all. And so, on this Mother's Day (and the other 364 days this year), I'm trying to be the mom my mother taught me how to be, both for my sons and for myself, even as I wish she could cheer me on. I was taught by one of the best that it's not about doing it all (she couldn't, as a single working mom) or being there for every minute (again, it literally wasn't possible), but it's about being fully present for the stuff that matters. I try to hear her voice in my head and give myself a break when I know she would have encouraged me to do so, congratulate myself for my part of the incredible mini-men my sons are becoming. Mostly, I just remind myself to slow down and enjoy the kids that she would have so adored. Happy Mother's Day, Mom.

"The majestic trees that line streets across the American South are a beautiful sight most of the year. Then there are the weeks when a winter storm hits, and the trees shed ice-laden limbs that crash down on the power lines below. It's at those times when millions of normally genteel Southern voices rise as one to ask, ""Why aren't these &@$#*%! wires underground?"" In one word: Money. How bad will it get? After a 2002 storm that knocked out electricity to 2 million customers in North Carolina, regulators there took a look at what it would cost to bury the three major power companies' overhead lines. The state Utilities Commission concluded the project would be ""prohibitively expensive."" ""Such an undertaking would cost approximately $41 billion, nearly six times the net book value of the utilities' current distribution assets, and would require approximately 25 years to complete,"" the report states. Customers' rates would have to more than double to pay for the project, the commission' staff found. It's not the snow, it's the ice . And underground lines ""are not without their disadvantages,"" they concluded. While more reliable ""under normal weather conditions,"" they take almost 60% longer to fix when something does happen to them. Underground power lines make up about 18% of U.S. transmission lines, according to the federal Energy Information Agency. Nearly all new residential and commercial developments have underground electric service, the agency said. But it noted that underground power lines cost five to 10 times more than overhead wires, don't last as long and cost more to replace. Stir crazy? How to stay sane . ""Buried power lines are protected from the wind, ice and tree damage that are common causes of outages, and so suffer fewer weather or vegetation-related outages,"" it concluded. ""But buried lines are more vulnerable to flooding, and can still fail due to equipment issues or lightning."" But there are some places that have decided to go ahead and dig. In Anaheim, California, the city is gradually burying its above-ground power lines, a project that dates back to the 1990s. The city added a 4% surcharge to electric bills to pay for the 50-year project, which costs more than $3 million a mile.

"ISIS is planning to mint its own currency in gold, silver and copper, the group said Thursday. Its aim is to stay away from the ""tyrant's financial system,"" ISIS said in a statement. It said it would issue another statement to explain the new currency's exchange rate, and where it can be found. The currency will include seven coins: two gold, three silver and two copper. The move is ""purely dedicated to God"" and will remove Muslims from the ""global economic system that is based on satanic usury,"" ISIS said. The terror group, which calls itself the Islamic State, has seized large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. It seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region.

Gurule said. He added: ""The difficulty, of course, with that kind of money is you can't just put that money in shoe boxes and place it under your mattress.

"Many female travelers are scrubbing India off their destination lists after the horrific gang rape and murder of a Delhi student in December 2012. According to the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, 35% less women visited India in the three months after the attack compared to the same period last year. Since December, rapes have persisted and mass protests have erupted across the country, pointing at inefficiency in dealing with such crimes and an inherent patriarchal nature. But there's one clear observation from the outcry: some of the voices belong to India's men. ""Every time I look into the mirror, I want to see a man whose mother, sister, wife and daughter are proud to call their own,"" says renowned Bollywood actor and director Farhan Akhtar on the website of his movement formed in March called MARD --- Men Against Rape and Discrimination. Distributing plastic moustaches -- a symbol of masculinity -- at the cricket ground of Eden Gardens in Kolkata in April, Farhan is using his influence to encourage men to become ""real MARDs"" -- also meaning ""men"" in the national language of Hindi. He is setting out a plan of action with Magic Bus --- an established NGO in India -- that uses sport to engage children from poorer communities, teaching values such as the importance of education, health and gender equality. ""Young people in India don't have good role models aside from Bollywood and sports people,"" says Matthew Spacie, Magic Bus founder. ""Farhan is a great voice addressing young people."" Parvati Pujari, 22, is one of around 10,000 youth leaders recruited from within communities to deliver the NGO's programs. She says boys are aware of the rape problem and the need for change. ""But somewhere in their minds, they see girls as weak,"" she adds. The programs focus on building confidence in girls, for example, to ask for the ball from boys in a game of football, and encouraging boys to believe girls can play as well as they can. Deepak Kashyap, a psychologist in Mumbai, says the idea of boys being better than girls begins in childhood: . ""We're talking about a country where the female infanticide rate is so high. That says that women are not wanted. Then boys grow up with a sense of entitlement."" But why do men, or boys, go on to rape? Kashyap says that although pinpointing the reasons are complicated:  ""Sex, as much as it's about sex, is about power. And the only thing that separates rape from usual sex is consent."" He adds that the definition of what it means to be a man can be unclear to children: ""I am gay and when I was growing up, I was always told to be a man,"" says Kashyap. ""I just didn't understand what that meant; does it mean abusing people? ""The reason why I became a psychologist is to understand myself, the culture, gender and sexuality."" Kaizaad Kotwal co-produces and directs American playwright Eve Ensler's Vagina Monologues in India with his mother, Mahabanoo Mody Kotwal. American woman allegedly gang-raped in India . At first, it was banned in several cities. The play speaks candidly of female sexuality, including issues such as rape and genital mutilation --- a conversation, Kaizaad Kotwal says, India wasn't ready to have. But the play is in its 11th year: ""The audiences, right from the start, embraced the play,"" says Kotwal. He claims it were mainly theaters -- and sometimes women -- that opposed. ""Patriarchy knows no gender; it's a mindset,"" says Kotwal. ""It's an attitude towards women which many women themselves perpetrate."" Although female goddesses and figures are revered in Hinduism, a dominating religion of the country, Kotwal argues: ""The goddess model is very hard for anyone to emulate. ""We're saying if women fall short of being a goddess, we'll violate them. In Hindu mythology, many virtuous women are only praised when in subservience to men."" Kashyap says a change in this culture will influence reforms in the legal system. However, some men are worried about what stricter anti-rape laws might mean for them. Goa Citizen's Welfare Trust formed an NGO in April to protect the region's men or boys wrongfully accused of rape: ""There are some women who are taking advantage of this law and misusing it,"" says founder, Michael Ferns. Dadleancho Ekvott, meaning the unity of men in the local language of Konkani, will work alongside Goa's police to verify whether a complaint of sexual harassment or rape is genuine by speaking to people surrounding the case. If the accused is thought to be innocent, they will try to prevent his arrest. Although Ferns believes innocent men deserve protection, he admits the problem faced by women in India is in greater need of attention, and men need to take action. However, some believe that this is a battle for women only. ""Research shows [women's movements] need autonomy and self determination,"" says Natalie Gyte, head of communications at the Women's Resource Center (W.R.C.), the UK umbrella body for women's charities. ""We have to decide what we want and how we want to achieve it. ""It's not dissimilar from the Civil Rights movement which had to come from black people to progress it and have something of their own. ""Men can't live that reality [of women's oppression]."" So what should men do? Gyte says: ""Men can listen, educate themselves and challenge sexist behavior whenever they observe it. ""We [W.R.C.] are all for men creating their own organizations, but they should be about challenging patriarchal views."" Opinion: Empowered women make nations strong . Some men are doing just that. On March 16, men from different walks of life, from suited office workers to rugged Delhi bikers, gathered in Jantar Mantar -- a well-known protest area in Delhi -- to apologize to women. Holding posters with words such as: ""Delhi women: I'm sorry, I'm changing,"" this was an alternative response to the rape crisis and the offense rate in the city, known as the crime capital of India. Recent figures from the National Crime Records Bureau show that in 2012, more women were raped in Delhi -- 585 cases -- than in any other of India's largest cities. The so-called public apology was organized by India for Integrity, a charity formed by a circle of male friends during the anti-corruption movement in 2011. They encourage personal responsibility and follow the slogan: ""I am corrupt and change starts with me."" ""This isn't our responsibility, what do you have to be sorry for? It's the girl's fault,"" was one such comment co-founder Jonathan Abraham received on the group's Facebook page, which has over 4,600 likes. ""This is the debate we need to have, encouraging people to introspect. That's the first step to change,"" says Abraham, echoing the philosophy of the late Mohandas Gandhi, leader of the Indian nationalist movement. Kotwal says that although the rape crisis in India cannot be denied, this is a problem the world over, citing the U.S. military as one example, where recent Pentagon estimates indicate a 37% increase in sexual assaults to 26,000 cases last year. But Abraham believes looking at the statistics of other countries is ignoring the fact that there's a huge problem at home. Nobody believes social overhauls happen overnight. Spacie says change begins with educating today's youth; therefore it will take a generation before real transformation is seen. But the efforts of some of India's gentlemen provide hope that chivalry is alive in a country where a rape crisis is at odds with its image of spirituality and gentleness. But how can the message reach the real culprits? Kotwal says: ""The message has to constantly be out in the media, public, our discourse, education, corporate and political worlds. ""It's got to be this drone that you can't get away from. We all have to become the message."" Anger, frustration over rapes in India: 'Mindset hasn't changed'","Female tourism to India has dropped 35% in three months after a high-profile rape .

"The big auto show in Detroit doesn't kick off until next week, but major car companies are already showing off some of their more exciting car-tech prototypes here at the International Consumer Electronics Show. BMW and Audi unveiled their latest driverless car technology and conducted demonstration drives. Nevada is one of a few states where it's legal to test drive autonomous cars, though it requires a person to sit in the driver's seat at all times. BMW added its highly active assist technology to a modified 2 Series Coupe. The car can slide into a controlled drift to demonstrate how precise the control systems are and how it can handle a critical situation. The company has posted a video showing it in action. ""It's like the best test driver you have,"" said Dr. Werner Huber, BMW project manager driver. The car uses steering, breaking and throttle to control acceleration, deceleration and direction in very small, exact amounts. The demonstration is just one aspect of the technical building blocks required to make a self-driving car. There are also sensors, environmental modeling and decision and driving strategy technologies that BMW is working on. Those were not included on this particular test vehicle. Early automated-vehicle prototypes from car makers, universities and Google looked like Frankenstein experiments, covered in custom-hacked hardware. Now the technology is getting smaller and the necessary sensors and cameras are shrinking to barely noticeable sizes. Audi is particularly proud of decreasing the size of its computer systems, which previously filled the entire trunk of the car, into a box that's mounted inside the glove compartment.  The German car manufacturer demonstrated its Sport Quattro Laserlight concept car at CES. Audi's real advancement this year is the compact zFAS car computer. In the future, the Nvidia powered system could be used for key automated-driving tasks like traffic sign recognition, lane departure warnings and pedestrian spotting. Size isn't the only technical challenge. Dependability is also incredibly important for a computer system driving a car. You can't reboot a vehicle while it's hurtling down a highway at 60 mph. ""We can't have these systems crash,"" said David Anderson, Nvidia's senior automotive solutions architect. ""This is a safety critical application."" Making it legal . Car makers agree that while there are many technical issues ahead, they may not be the most daunting obstacles self-driving cars face. Autonomous driving features are at least seven to 10 years away from becoming commercially available. The technology inside the cars is developing fast, but the auto industry will need at least that much time to sort out a tangle of non-hardware and software issues to clear the way for the cars. ""The main problems are regulations and laws,"" said Audi's Heribert Braeutigam. Various laws will have to be updated around the world to make it legal for automated cars to drive on the road. Car manufactures and suppliers are already forming working groups to address the topics and work with governments. ""We can only influence the technology. The framework work must be done by governments,"" said Huber. Insurance and liability are particular tricky. If a car driving itself gets into an accident that results in damages or injuries, who is responsible? The driver who was watching Netflix on a state-of-the-art car entertainment system, or the manufacturer that designed the car? Researchers and makers of driverless cars say the technology will be far safer than people-driven vehicles because they eliminate unpredictable human errors like distracted or drunk driving, or poor reactions to emergency situations. However, the cars won't be accident proof. The first major accident involving the technology will be a huge public relations hurdle for the entire industry. Driverless cars' people problem . Inside the vehicle, the humans are the difficulty. ""The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge,"" Huber said. At first, cars will share driving responsibilities with their human owners. Companies are working on automated parking features or traffic assistance technology that will take over in specific scenarios under certain speed limit. There will be many times where the driver will have to actually drive, which means they will not be completely off the hook even during downtime. ""He's not allowed to sleep, read a newspaper, or a use a laptop,"" said Braeutigam, outlining some of the rules for a driver in a partially automated vehicle. The rules are to minimize the amount of time needed to turn a passive passenger into an alert driver who is in control of the car. That's where the connected, in-car entertainment and information systems come in. They may seem like an unnecessary distraction or luxury, but they're actually a key safety feature in the automated driving system. Car makers will want to limit drivers to only using in-car systems while not steering so the vehicle can get their attention when there's an emergency or when they need to take over driving. An in-car system can pause movies, turn off e-mail and hide reading materials when it's time to drive. If the driver doesn't respond, it might sound alarms and blink lights, eventually turning on the hazards and slowing to a complete stop. ""We need five to 10 seconds to pull him back into driving,"" Huber said. During that time, the car must be able to operate autonomously. Will the public want them? There's also the small matter of selling the public on automated driving. For people who love the act of driving, taking a powerful car like a BMW 2 Series Coupe and turning the action over to an automated system might seem like a waste. ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way,"" Huber said. That means bringing content and activities to the car so that the driver can make better use of his or her 30 minutes in traffic. They'll still be able to take over during the fun parts, zipping down a curvy country road. Privacy will be another big concern. The various sensors and in-car systems can collect data about driving patterns and locations and save that data in the cloud. The idea is to use this information to assist the driver, say updating a car's route based on real-time mapping information. A recent report to Congress said in-car services that currently collect location data on drivers don't always follow recommenced privacy practices. Many companies, like car makers or GPS services, share collected data with third-parties, though the report didn't find any selling the information to data brokers. The report recommended the government do more to protect drivers' privacy. Information collection will become more prevalent in the future. Eventually, car makers hope to open up the lines of communications between individual cars on the road to better avoid traffic jams and prevent accidents.

"The anti-apartheid message was serious and heartfelt, but the song that alerted many around the world to the injustices of the South African regime could not have been more upbeat. ""Free Nelson Mandela"" by The Special AKA was a Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom in 1984, and it instantly became the unofficial anthem and slogan for the international anti-apartheid movement. The song's eponymous subject rose to prominence in the 1950s as a radical young member of the African National Congress, the main opposition movement to the segregationist South African government. As an advocate of guerrilla attacks, Mandela was frequently arrested and eventually convicted in 1964, along with other ANC leaders, for sabotage. He received a life prison sentence, and spent 27 years in a cell, mostly on Robben Island, off the South African coast. While Mandela languished in jail, an anti-apartheid movement slowly developed in the West, starting with sporting sanctions against South Africa and later an artists' boycott of performances in the country. The writer of ""Free Nelson Mandela,"" Jerry Dammers -- the founder of the multiracial English ska-punk band The Specials, later renamed The Special AKA  -- admits he knew little about Mandela before he attended an anti-apartheid concert in London in 1983. That concert gave him the idea for the song. ""I'd never actually heard of Nelson Mandela, although I knew a lot about the anti-apartheid movement and he was becoming a figurehead for the whole movement,"" Dammers told CNN. The keyboardist, who also wrote ""Ghost Town,"" the seminal Specials song against the policies of Great Britain's prime minister at the time, Margaret Thatcher, may not have known much about the imprisoned anti-apartheid figurehead, but his lyrics brought Mandela's struggle to the attention of a wider audience. The song's relentlessly upbeat feel certainly helped push it up the charts. ""It ends with the thing of 'I'm begging you' and then 'I'm telling you,'"" Dammers said. ""It is a demand but in a positive way, it brought some sort of hope that the situation could be sorted out."" Some of the lyrics: . Free Nelson Mandela . 21 years in captivity . Shoes too small to fit his feet . His body abused but his mind is still free . Are you so blind that you cannot see? I said... Free Nelson Mandela, I'm begging you . Free Nelson Mandela . Veteran DJ and broadcaster Paul Gambaccini said the song was effective in educating people about Mandela, whose reputation was low in the West at the time. ""Now we have this sainted vision of Mandela, but at the time Thatcher treated him as a terrorist. So to release a record about someone whom your PM considers a terrorist is quite brave."" The song helped to change perceptions about Mandela, according to Gambaccini, a presenter on leading UK station BBC Radio 2. ""It did educate people about apartheid an incredible amount, because they certainly weren't going to learn about Mandela from conventional sources. The word on him from on high was very bad, so it was up to musicians to take a leading role in rehabilitating his reputation."" ""Free Nelson Mandela"" was also an extremely effective protest song, he added, a view echoed in 2010 by left-leaning current affairs magazine New Statesman, which included it in a list of the top 20 political anthems of all time. ""'Free Nelson Mandela' was effective for two reasons,"" Gambaccini said. ""It's a good pop record in that it's catchy and sounds good. And you immediately know what it's about, because the first three words are 'Free Nelson Mandela.' And secondly, it had a clear message that the audience agreed with."" And the fact that The Specials were at the time a ""Top 10 band"" meant the audience took note. ""If the Specials say it, there must be something to it,"" as Gambaccini noted. Four years later, in 1988, Dammers and the band Simple Minds helped organize the Nelson Mandela 70th birthday concert at London's Wembley Stadium, featuring acts such as Dire Straits, George Michael and Sting. Peter Gabriel played ""Biko"" about another anti-apartheid activist, while Steven Van Zandt performed his influential song ""Sun City."" The event was watched by a global television audience of 600 million and is credited with hardening popular opposition internationally to the apartheid regime. Gambaccini is proud of his contribution to the event, for which he was one of the TV presenters. ""The concert was an incredible success,"" he said. ""It had the biggest TV audience to date, and put Mandela in Topic A position around the world. But it might never have happened without the song 'Free Nelson Mandela,' because this inspired some of the artists who appeared at Wembley to be there."" As the impact of the concert rippled around the world, the South African government was secretly holding talks with Mandela. These meetings culminated in his release on February 11, 1990. Four years later, he succeeded F.W. de Klerk to become the republic's first black president. Mandela never forgot the debt he owed to supporters in the United Kingdom. In 1996 he used a speech to both Houses of Parliament in London to give his thanks: ""We take this opportunity once more to pay tribute to the millions of Britons who, through the years, stood up to say: No to apartheid!"" In 2008, singer Amy Winehouse joined Dammers for the finale to a concert in London's Hyde Park marking Mandela's 90th birthday. The song's message had long since been realized -- and indeed the by-then-frail elder statesman appeared onstage -- but it was received as warmly as ever.","""Free Nelson Mandela,"" by The Special AKA raised awareness of the jailed ANC figurehead .

"(CNN) -- A soldier suspected of fatally shooting 12 and wounding 31 at Fort Hood in Texas on Thursday is not dead as previously reported by the military, the base's commander said Thursday evening. A civilian officer who was wounded in the incident shot the suspect, who is ""in custody and in stable condition,"" Army Lt. Gen. Robert Cone told reporters. ""Preliminary reports indicate there was a single shooter that was shot multiple times at the scene,"" Cone said at a news conference. ""However, he was not killed as previously reported."" The suspect, identified as Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, opened fire at a military processing center at Fort Hood around 1:30 p.m., Cone said. Three others initially taken into custody for interviews have been released, Cone said. Hasan, 39, is a graduate of Virginia Tech and a psychiatrist licensed in Virginia who was practicing at Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood, according to military and professional records. Previously, he worked at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. A federal official said Hasan is a U.S. citizen of Jordanian descent. Military documents show that Hasan was born in Virginia and was never deployed outside the United States. In a statement released Thursday, Hasan's cousin, Nader Hasan, said his family is ""filled with grief for the families of today's victims."" ""Our family loves America. We are proud of our country, and saddened by today's tragedy,"" the statement said. ""Because this situation is still unfolding, we have nothing else that we are able to share with you at this time."" Hasan was scheduled to be deployed to Iraq ""and appeared to be upset about that,"" Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said. ""I think that there is a lot of investigation going on now into his background and what he was doing that was not known before,"" Hutchison said. Hutchison said she was told that the soldiers at the readiness facility ""were filling out paper processing to go to Iraq or Afghanistan,"" according to CNN affiliate KXAN in Austin, Texas. The readiness center is one of the last stops before soldiers deploy. It is also one of the first places a soldier goes upon returning to the United States. The base reopened Thursday night after being under lockdown for more than five hours. At a news conference earlier in the day, Cone said at least 10 of the dead were soldiers. The shooter had two weapons, both handguns, Cone said. iReport.com: Are you there? Send pics, video . A witness in a building adjacent to where the shooting happened said soldiers were cutting up their uniforms into homemade bandages as the wounded were brought into the building. ""It was total chaos,"" the witness said. Cone said a graduation ceremony was being held in an auditorium just 50 meters from where the shooting took place. ""Thanks to the quick reaction of several soldiers, they were able to close off the doors to that auditorium where there were some 600 people inside,"" he said. Peggy McCarty of Missouri told CNN affiliate KSHB that her daughter, Keara Bono, was among Thursday's wounded. She said she briefly spoke to Bono, who told her she had been shot in her left shoulder but was doing well. ""She's being deployed to Iraq on December 7,"" McCarty said. ""I thought I was more worried about her going over to Iraq than here, just doing training in Texas. She just got there yesterday."" A woman who lives on base, about eight blocks from the shooting, said she and her daughter were at home when her husband called and told them to stay inside. ""And I asked him why, what was going on. He said that there was a shooting,"" said the woman, Nicole, who asked that her last name not be used. She said her husband called her back about 20 minutes later and told her to go upstairs, stay away from doors and windows and keep the doors locked. ""It's just been crazy,"" she said. ""Sirens everywhere."" A soldier who asked not to be identified told CNN that an e-mail went out to all base personnel instructing them not to speak to the media. President Obama called the shootings ""tragic"" and ""a horrific outburst of violence."" He expressed his condolences for the shooting victims. ""These are men and women who have made the selfless and courageous decision to risk, and at times give, their lives to protect the rest of us on a daily basis,"" Obama said. ""It's difficult enough when we lose these brave Americans in battles overseas. It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an Army base on American soil."" Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple, Texas, posted an online appeal for blood as it began receving victims. ""Due to the recent events on Fort Hood, we are in URGENT need of ALL blood types,"" it said. Fort Hood, with about 40,000 troops, is home to the Army's 1st Cavalry Division and elements of the 4th Infantry Division, as well as the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 13th Corps Support Command. It is located near Killeen, Texas. The headquarters unit and three brigades of the 1st Cavalry are currently deployed in Iraq. At least 25,000 people are at Fort Hood on any given day, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon said. Fort Hood is home to the Warrior Combat Stress Reset Program, which is designed to help soldiers overcome combat stress issues. In June, Fort Hood's commander, Lt. Gen. Rick Lynch, told CNN that he was trying to ease the kind of stresses soldiers face. He has pushed for soldiers working a day schedule to return home for dinner by 6 p.m., and required his personal authorization for anyone working weekends. At the time, two soldiers stationed there had committed suicide in 2009 -- a rate well below those of other posts. Nearby Killeen was the scene of one of the most deadly shootings in American history 18 years ago when George Hennard crashed his truck into a Luby's Cafeteria and began shooting, killing 23 people and wounding 20. Hennard's spree lasted 14 minutes. He eventually took his own life.","Suspect in shootings wounded but alive, Army official says .

"It's bad enough that we have to fear identity thieves who are trying to scam us with malicious messages sent from PCs. We now must worry about being targeted by our household appliances, as well. An Internet-security firm has discovered what they are calling a global cyberattack launched from more than 100,000 everyday consumer gadgets such as home-networking routers, televisions and at least one ""smart"" refrigerator. It's being called possibly the first proven cyberattack to originate from connected appliances -- the so-called ""Internet of Things."" Proofpoint said the attack occurred between December 23 and January 6, and featured waves of malicious e-mail targeting businesses and individuals worldwide. In a post on the Proofpoint site, the company said the scam involved more than 750,000 e-mails from more than 100,000 appliances that had been commandeered by ""thingbots,"" or robotic programs that can be remotely installed on digital devices. It was not immediately clear Friday which victims were targeted and whether the scammers were successful in collecting any personal information. ""Bot-nets are already a major security concern and the emergence of thingbots may make the situation much worse,"" said David Knight, general manager of Proofpoint's Information Security division. ""Many of these devices are poorly protected at best and consumers have virtually no way to detect or fix infections when they do occur. [We] may find distributed attacks increasing as more and more of these devices come online and attackers find additional ways to exploit them."" Recent years have seen an explosion in the number of devices fitted with Internet connectivity, from eyewear to toothbrushes to refrigerators and beyond. Earlier this week, Google paid $3.2 billion to acquire Nest, a company that makes smart home thermostats. The International Data Corporation (IDC) predicts there will be more than 30 billion connected devices in the world by 2020. Proofpoint's findings suggest that just as personal computers can be unknowingly compromised and used to launch large-scale cyberattacks, so can any smart household appliance. And poorly protected ""smart"" devices may be easier to infect and control than PCs, laptops or tablets. A sophisticated hack was not needed to compromise the appliances in this attack. Instead, the use of default passwords left the devices completely exposed on public networks, according to Proofpoint. The company also noted that connected appliances typically aren't protected by anti-spam or anti-virus software, nor are they routinely monitored for security breaches.","Security firm: Global cyberattack was launched from more than 100,000 everyday appliances .

"The cries of the suffering carried through a small, cramped one-story clinic in typhoon-ravaged Tacloban where the medicine was all but gone Thursday, but the number of wounded in the hard-hit Philippine city continued to grow. The clinic at the airport in the decimated capital city of Leyte province is one of the few places where those injured in Super Typhoon Haiyan and its aftermath can turn for help, what little help there is six days after the storm. ""We don't have any medicines. We don't have any supplies. We have IVs, but it's running out,"" Dr. Katrina Catabay told CNN. ""Most of the people don't have water and food. That's why they come here. Most of the kids are dehydrated. They are suffering from diarrhea and vomiting."" Help is coming, on military and civilian transports, by air and by sea. But much of it has been piling up at airports. While relief organizations say they have been able to deliver limited aid to some victims, many CNN crews reported seeing little sign of any large-scale organized relief effort in the hardest-hit areas. Blame Haiyan and its unprecedented strength and scope, said UNICEF spokesman Christopher De Bono. ""I don't think that's anyone's fault. I think it's the geography and the devastation,"" he said. Still, the desperation is increasing, and becoming more serious. ""We mostly need food and water, that's the most important,"" Catabay said. ""We need supplies."" At the clinic, a Philippine military officer called names off a clipboard, the names of those who will be airlifted out of the city. ""The elderly, the children that are sick"" are the priority, the officer said. For at least one man, the evacuation came too late. The man died at the clinic. His body was put on a gurney and pushed to the end of a hallway because there is nowhere to put him, the clinic staff said. Death toll climbs . Throughout the devastation, bodies of victims lie buried in the debris or out in the open. The government hasn't counted them all yet, but initial fears that 10,000 may have died have subsided. By Thursday morning, the official death toll had climbed to 2,357, disaster officials said. The typhoon left 3,853 people injured and 77 people missing, according to the Philippines' National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Emotional extremes for families of typhoon victims . The toll is ""going to be horrific,"" Philippine Interior Minister Mar Roxas said. ""There are still many towns that have not sent in complete reports and out of the 40 towns of Leyte, for example, only 20 have been contacted.  So there's another 20 towns with no communication,"" he said. ""It's going to be a high death toll.  I don't want to go into just throwing out numbers."" Philippine President Benigno Aquino III  told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday that he expected the final number would likely be around 2,000 to 2,500. Faces of the storm . When it struck Friday, Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Yolanda, flattened entire towns. The storm destroyed at least 80,000 homes, according to the latest Philippine government accounting. Although estimates of the number left homeless vary, the Philippine government puts it at more than 582,000. Expecting to die . The storm also shattered families. Mayple Nunal and her husband, Ignacio, lost their two daughters, Gnacy Pearl and Gnacy May -- washed away when the storm's ferocious storm surge ripped through Tacloban. ""The big waves, we were like inside the washing machine,"" Mayple Nunal said. ""And we were expecting that we would die."" While Nunal and her husband are safe, receiving treatment in Cebu, United Nations officials have warned of increasing desperation and lawlessness among those left homeless. Eight people died when a wall collapsed Tuesday during a stampede at a government warehouse in Leyte province, Philippine National Food Authority administrator Orlan Calayag said Wednesday. Police and security stood by as people stormed the building and took some 100,000 sacks of rice, he said. The United Nations said the situation is especially dangerous for women and children. Some areas haven't been reached yet, according to Valerie Amos, the U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief. Police warned a CNN crew to turn back Wednesday on the road south of Tacloban, saying rebels had been shooting at civilians. ""Maybe they are looking for food,"" a police commander told CNN. Scenes of devastation, calls for help . ""Pushing aid"" to Tacloban . There were, however, some successes. U.S. Marines arrived Wednesday in Cebu, transforming the sleepy airbase there into a buzzing center of activity as cargo aircraft, tilt-rotor Ospreys and camouflaged Marines got to work preparing for the enormous job of receiving, sorting and delivering aid to millions in need. Two 747 airplanes loaded with humanitarian aid from the United States have arrived, and Marines are ""pushing aid"" from Cebu to Tacloban, Brig. Gen. Paul Kennedy said on CNN's ""Situation Room"" ""It's a serious situation down here,"" Kennedy said. ""...Some of those neighborhoods are inundated with water, and some of it's inaccessible"" because of the debris. One of the big problems is figuring out how to get needed supplies, including heavy machinery, to these areas. ""It's a matter of capacity at this point. This just doesn't come out of a box. It has to be moved down here. It's a remote location,"" he said. The Royal Australian Air Force also landed at Cebu, delivering a portable field hospital that was soon sent on its way to Tacloban. Taiwanese troops also arrived with medical aid, and Doctors Without Borders said three of nine cargo shipments it has planned also arrived in Cebu on Wednesday. The planes carried medical supplies, shelter materials, hygiene kits and other gear, the agency said. Opinion: Childhood in the path of typhoons . U.N.: Pace of relief lacking . Teams from Doctors Without Borders also have reached remote Guiuan, a village of about 45,000 that was among the first areas hit by the full force of the storm, the agency said. ""The situation here is bleak,"" said Alexis Moens, the aid group's assessment team leader. ""The village has been flattened -- houses, medical facilities, rice fields, fishing boats all destroyed. People are living out in the open; there are no roofs left standing in the whole of Guiuan. The needs are immense and there are a lot of surrounding villages that are not yet covered by any aid organizations."" Meanwhile, the U.N. World Food Programme began distributing food in Tacloban, handing out rice to 3,000 people on Wednesday, the agency said, and the  U.S. Agency for International Development also said it expected to deliver its first shipment of relief supplies to victims on Wednesday. The uptick in aid deliveries comes a day after the road between the capital, Manila, and hard-hit Tacloban opened, holding out the promise that aid will begin to flow more quickly. But six days after the storm struck -- with more than 2 million people in need of food, according to the Philippine government -- even the U.N.'s Amos acknowledged the pace of relief is still lacking. ""This is a major operation that we have to mount,"" she said Wednesday. ""We're getting there. But in my view it's far too slow."" Philippine President Aquino has defended relief efforts, saying that in addition to all the challenges of blocked roads and downed power and communication lines, local governments were overwhelmed, forcing the federal government to step in and perform both its own role and those of local officials.

"(CNN) -- It's an entirely preventable disease, and when diagnosed early, it's easily treatable. Yet Malaria still claims hundreds of thousands of lives each year. All it takes is a single mosquito bite and you can become infected. In 2012, the tropical disease caused 627,000 deaths internationally, 90% of them in sub-Saharan Africa. Ashley Uys, a South African biotechnologist-turned-enterpreneur, is hoping to bring that number down to zero. Through his company Medical Diagnostic, Uys has developed a self-testing kit that can diagnose the disease in less than 30 minutes, and put sufferers on the path to recovery faster. ""I decided to look at what is the most needing product in Africa at the moment. And malaria, malaria is big,"" says Uys. ""I then decided to look at a malaria test that can actually show you the strain of malaria you have -- the type of malaria -- so (doctors) know which treatment to give you, and then also to see if the treatment is working or not. So I developed a test that can do all of that."" Merging science and business . The best think about Uys' test is the price: they cost roughly 30 cents each, a fact Uys takes immense pride in. ""The fact that (they are affordable) of course makes it more accessible to the public. For me. it is very satisfying to know that a farm worker in a rural area doesn't have to worry about going to a doctor. Our product can be used at the point of care,"" he says. ""You don't need skilled labor to use it: prick (your finger), run the test and wait for results. There's a lot of diamonds in the rough (is Africa), a lot of potential, and diseases and epidemics are killing off this potential. So it has a knock-on effect that is important."" Given Uys is only 30-years old, he's achieved an incredible amount. Like many young entrepreneurs, he has drawn inspiration from his childhood and surroundings. Using this experience, Uys creates local solutions for everyday problems. For the Cape Town native, malaria prevention is just the beginning. Saying 'No' to drugs . Uys has turned his attention to another scourge affecting his community: Drug use. ""On the Cape Flats, there was a big problem of drugs abuse,"" he recalls. ""People abusing methamphetamine, et cetera. Fortunately for me, although I grew up on the Cape Flats where it's very prevalent, I used sport to keep me away from bad habits and getting involved with the wrong crowd."" Now, as the founder of his own biotech company, Uys created a test capable of detecting a range of drugs, including amphetamines, benzyls, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroine and morphine. The idea first came to him when, following a survey of users, he identified the correlation between drug use and eye movement. Following this revelation, Uys had a light-bulb movement that would take his product development to the next level. ""We get five to 10 megapixel cameras on mobile phones. I thought to myself: 'imagine developing an app for your phone where you can actually test your kids for drugs by using the flash as a light stimulus. The camera can capture the movement and calculate the speed of your eyes and action, or (tell) if they're dilated or constricted."" Uys is still working on the prototypes for his Oculus ID pupil scanner, but he hopes the product will be ready to go into the market in coming weeks. ""I'm looking at innovation as the challenge for me. If you look at the first world countries it's satisfying for me to see that we are innovating on that level or even better. ""And me coming from Belhar, I didn't go to Harvard, didn't have a rich dad who could buy me what I wanted -- I had to work for everything. I had to work and study. I used to pack fish when I was a student. And that motivated me to work harder,"" he says.

"If you're tired of nagging your kids (or another member of your household) to brush their teeth, you have a new ally. A French company has introduced what they're calling the world's first connected electric toothbrush, which syncs wirelessly with a smartphone to track brushing habits, announce whether you, or your kids, have brushed thoroughly enough and reward you for good oral hygiene. For extra motivation, or shaming, the brush can share information with your social network or even your dentist. It's called the Kolibree toothbrush, and it was unveiled this week at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where some attendees asked if they could test prototypes on their pearly whites right there (for sanitary reasons, the answer was no). The device will cost from $99 to $200, depending on the model, and will be available for pre-order this summer through Kickstarter or another crowdfunding site. ""It works just like a regular toothbrush,"" said Kolibree spokesperson Renee Blodgett in a phone interview. ""The only difference is that all the data is stored on your phone so you can see how you're brushing."" Users download a mobile app and connect via Bluetooth, and the Kolibree documents every brushing via three sensors that record 1) how long you brush, 2) whether you brush all four quadrants of your mouth, and 3) whether you brush up and down (good) instead of just side to side (bad). The data automatically syncs to your Android phone or iPhone, telling you whether you brushed long enough and reached all the crucial areas of your teeth and gums. The Kolibree app charts your progress and scores your brushing technique to encourage you, or your kids, to improve brushing habits. In this way, the device turns a mundane daily activity into a game, which its makers hope will engage people -- especially kids -- and encourage them to brush longer and more often. ""You create this incentive around brushing,"" Blodgett said. The brushing data also will be available via an API to let third-party game designers develop new apps for the Kolibree system. The Kolibree toothbrush was invented by Thomas Serval, a French engineer and a leader in that country's tech industry. He was inspired to design it after suspecting that his children were lying to him about whether they had brushed their teeth. It's not the first ""smart"" toothbrush on the market, however: The manual, $25 Beam Brush went on sale about a year ago. The Beam also connects to phones via Bluetooth and records brushing time, although unlike the Kolibree it cannot track the brush's movements in the mouth.","A French company has introduced what they're calling the world's first connected electric toothbrush .

"The ""universal background checks"" now being pushed by some gun control supporters is code for closing federal loopholes on such checks at gun shows and other private sales. U.S. law requires background checks for all people who try to buy firearms from federally licensed dealers. But federal law does not require background checks for ""private transactions,"" like sales at gun shows. Many states have their own statutes requiring such checks for private sales. The issue has risen high in the national conversation after the shock ignited by December's mass shooting of six adults and 20 children at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Expanded background checks now enjoy the support of mayors in some of the largest cities in America. The idea has been embraced by gun violence survivor Gabrielle Giffords, a self-described gun owner. It's also being considered for possible legislation by a White House task force led by Vice President Joe Biden.  The task force is expected to include universal background checks as part of its recommended legislation. ""This may be the single most important gun violence prevention measure that the government could adopt,"" said Lindsay Nichols, an attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""This loophole means that dangerous criminals and dangerously mentally ill individuals have a most unfettered access to firearms."" But National Rifle Association President David Keene suggested to CNN's Candy Crowley that he has little faith in universal background checks, saying they don't work. Keene spoke a few days after sitting in on the Biden task force. He implied that the task force wasn't sincerely considering NRA positions on gun control issues, saying they were simply ""checking the box. They were able to say, 'We've met with the NRA. We've met with the people that are strong Second Amendment supporters.' "" Later, the NRA issued a statement saying it was ""disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment."" What part of universal background checks does the NRA support? Keene did say he favored background checks to block people who may be mentally ill or potentially violent from buying guns. But federal law already requires that, Nichols said. One problem with the systems is that many states don't report the names of people who've been legally labeled dangerously mentally ill. Improving the accuracy and availability of information about these people, Keene said, is one possible area for agreement. He suggested ""tightening up on putting information in the database. It's school security. It's beefing up the way we deal with the mentally ill."" Nichols said ""huge gaps"" exist in the database, which is called the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. For example, the Virginia Tech shooter, who killed 33 people and himself in 2007, had passed two background checks because Virginia didn't submit his mentally ill status to the database, Nichols said. ""As a result of that shooting, the federal government passed a law encouraging these states to submit these records, and a large number of states passed laws. So there's been significant improvement in reporting dangerously mentally ill persons to NICS,"" Nichols said. ""But there are still about half of the states that report hardly any dangerously mentally ill people. They may not have the resources or the political will to enforce the law. Yeah, it's crazy."" How do background checks now work? Anytime someone buys a gun from a federally licensed gun dealer, the dealer is required to run a check on the buyer by submitting the name to the federal database. That database consists of criminal records and mental health records as provided by federal and state courts and agencies. Convicted felons, people convicted of violent domestic crimes, and those determined by the courts to be dangerously mentally ill are prohibited by federal law from buying firearms, Nichols said. Also, states have added their own categories of who is prohibited from buying a gun, Nichols said. For example, California prohibits gun ownership for people convicted of any kind of violent crime, drug offenses, alcohol abuse and juvenile offenses while underage, Nichols said. Vermont is the only state without such laws, Nichols said. Just how many gun purchases don't require federal background checks, and how does that happen? Forty percent of all firearms purchased in the United States are sold without background checks because the guns aren't purchased from a federally licensed firearms dealer, Nichols said. Rather, those weapons are bought at gun shows, on street corners, over the Internet or from friends or neighbors, Nichols said. These are the so-called loopholes in the current federal background check system. The NRA disputes that characterization about the ""gun show loophole"" because federally licensed firearms dealers participate at gatherings and, of course, conduct background checks. ""Most of the guns that are purchased at a gun show are purchased from federal firearms-licensed holders,"" Keene said. He challenged the 40% figure for gun sales without background checks -- particularly at gun shows. ""We don't know what (is the) percentage at gun shows. It may be 10%,"" Keene said. ""It's not such a loophole at gun shows. But it's like if you sell me your shotgun, that's a private transaction. Just as if I sell you a car, I don't have a dealer's license."" Ten states and the District of Columbia have their own laws requiring background checks for any firearm sold at a gun show, Nichols said. Six more states require background checks for gun-show sales of handguns, but not for rifles or shotguns, Nichols said. In total, 16 states and the District of Columbia require background checks on handguns sold at gun shows, Nichols said. These states that close loopholes, however, provide exemptions for gun transfers between immediate family members and between licensed dealers, Nichols said. Are background checks effective? From the time when the gun control measures of the Brady Act were enacted on March 1, 1994, through the end of 2008, the federal government processed more than 97 million applications for gun transfers or permits, the Justice Department says. Almost 1.8 million applications were denied, the agency said. On this matter, both sides are in agreement. Said Keene: ""Background checks are generally a good thing."" Added Nichols: ""Background checks have a huge deterrent effect. People who are ineligible to buy a gun are unlikely to try if they know they are going to be subjected to a background check.""","""Universal background checks"" refer to closing loopholes in federal gun sales laws .
Those loopholes apply to private gun sales that usually involve gun shows .
Advocates say 40% of gun sales are private transactions, including gun shows .
NRA challenges the 40% figure and disputes the ""loophole"" characterization ."
"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- It started with verbal abuse, and then -- perhaps inevitably -- it got physically, terrifyingly violent. Supporters of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak flooded into Cairo's Tahrir Square Wednesday after the president's opponents dominated the scene for more than a week. Separated at first by barriers, the rival demonstrators exchanged insults, then began throwing anything they could find at each other, including shoes, rocks and sticks. Suddenly the barriers came down. People surged toward each other in a chaotic scene that conjured images of a revolution. Some injured protesters fell. Others stumbled through the crowd. Blood streamed down the faces of the wounded. A few women away from the front line gave the injured water and swabbed at their wounds. Many of the injuries were serious, even though demonstrators wrapped sweatshirts and other clothes around their heads to protect themselves from flying stones. Dozens of wounded were carried away, bleeding from gashes. It was impossible to tell from visits to a makeshift clinic which side was faring worse, CNN's Ben Wedeman said. He said simply: ""They are all Egyptians."" A mosque served as a makeshift field hospital, staffed by volunteer doctors, he said. The day was spotted with scenes of brutality. At one point, bloodied men from the pro-regime side were dragged toward the center of Tahrir Square by anti-government demonstrators who beat and kicked them along the way. One man ripped out the hair of one of the captives. Police were nowhere to be seen. Army tanks surrounded the square, but the military proved unable or unwilling to separate the two sides. The hatches on their tanks and armored personnel carriers remained closed. Some brave Egyptians tried to stop the violence, putting their bodies between the sides. Briefly they seemed to succeed. There was a lull in the violence. Some protesters from the rival camps embraced. All at once, about 50 or 60 people carrying clubs and riding horses and camels charged into the square, beating some protesters. At least one man was pulled off his horse and beaten. And the frenzy intensified. People tore paving stones out of the streets with crowbars and their bare hands, filling bags with rocks to use as an arsenal in the street battle. Some ripped street signs out of the ground, using the metal as makeshift shields. CNN's Hala Gorani was threatened by a pro-Mubarak supporter who told her to get out of the area. ""I was a little bit fearful,"" she said. Another protester stepped in and protected her, telling the first not to touch her because ""she is with me."" She said she ran as fast as she could back to her colleagues. ""I'm fine, but I've got to say, this is a situation that can turn on a dime. There is a lot of anger coming from those protesters."" They are attacking journalists, she said, and will threaten anyone who looks Western. It was unclear whether there was shooting on the square. CNN's Fred Pleitgen and Anderson Cooper said they heard shots being fired, although Cooper suggested it may have been troops on the sidelines shooting into the air to try to restore order. The interior ministry denied there was shooting. CNN's Ivan Watson, overlooking the square from a hotel, did not hear any gunfire, he said, calling that ""a blessing."" And somehow, amid the clashes, pockets of peace remained -- including around small groups who, amid the violence, dropped to their knees and faced Mecca. The time had come for daily prayers. But the battle continued for hours, with regime supporters blocking exits from the square as soldiers largely remained on the sidelines. A group of women sat weeping, terrified by the violence they had seen. As night fell, pro-Mubarak forces began throwing Molotov cocktails, and with the sun going down, flames rose from the square. The army deployed hoses from the sidelines of the square, spraying water over the heads of the demonstrators onto the fires. The troops may be able to extinguish the physical fires. Whether they will be able to put out the metaphorical ones sweeping the city -- if they even want to -- remains to be seen. CNN's Amir Ahmed and Ivan Watson contributed to this report.","Pro-regime forces throw Molotov cocktails, starting fires as night falls .

"(CNN)""The Kingdom ... strongly condemns and denounces this cowardly terrorist act that is rejected by true Islamic religion as well as the rest of the religions and beliefs."" So reads the statement issued by Saudi Arabia, where I grew up, the day the offices of ""Charlie Hebdo"" came under attack, with the loss of 12 lives. Last Sunday, to show further solidarity with the victims, the Saudi ambassador to France joined other world leaders in Paris for a unity rally to celebrate free speech. This is consistent with the face Saudi Arabia presents to the outside world. Visitors to the website of the Saudi embassy in Washington are invited to ""learn ... how the Kingdom's political system is rooted in Islam's traditions which call for peace, justice, equality, consultation and respect for the rights of the individual."" Just two days before the Paris rally, my friend Raif Badawi was removed, in shackles, from a mini-bus outside the Al-Jafali mosque in Jeddah as a large crowd gathered around him after Friday prayers. According to eyewitnesses, he closed his eyes and raised his head skyward as a security officer approached him from behind with a large cane and started to beat him. Witnesses say Raif was lashed 50 times. Afterwards, he was taken back to prison where he is serving a 10-year sentence—for blogging. Raif's next flogging was set to take place today, but Saudi authorities postponed it due to medical advice, his wife said. She expects he will be flogged again next week—and every following week—until his sentence of 1,000 lashes is complete. Raif is officially charged with ""adopting liberal thought,"" ""founding a liberal website,"" and ""insulting Islam."" He has become the latest symbol of the two-faced policy his country takes towards human rights. Saudi Arabia is a strong American ally that has enjoyed virtually unconditional support from the United States for decades. President Bush famously held hands with its monarch, King Abdullah, as the two strolled through his Crawford, Texas ranch during the King's 2005 state visit. President Obama was widely criticized for appearing to bow to Abdullah at a G-20 summit in London. In the same month that ISIS horrified the world with its brutal beheading of journalist James Foley, Saudi Arabia publicly beheaded 19 people, for crimes ranging from smuggling cannabis to sorcery. Limb amputations for theft are sanctioned by the state religion. In addition to oil, Saudi Arabia is the world's leading exporter of Salafism, an ultra-conservative strain of Islam. The country touts itself as the birthplace of the religion of peace—yet underlines the Islamic declaration of ""Shahadah"" on its flag with a sword. Osama bin Laden was a Saudi citizen, as were 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11. Why does a world outraged by the horrific actions of ISIS and the Taliban turn a blind eye to the way this country treats its own citizens? The first reason is obvious. It isn't just our governments. Every time we fill our cars with gas, we all bow to the Saudi king. The second is more complex. Online videos of Raif's flogging show worshipers from the mosque, including young children, running excitedly towards the square to watch the beating. Afterwards, the crowd erupts into cheers and applause, chanting ""Allahu Akbar!"" (God is Great!) in unison. This isn't surprising. The public likely considers Raif guilty of blasphemy and apostasy. A 2013 Pew Research poll found that large numbers in Muslim countries favor the death penalty for leaving Islam—including 88% of Egyptian and 62% of Pakistani Muslims, as well as majorities in Jordan, Malaysia, Palestine, and Afghanistan. Of course, these views don't represent all Muslims. But contrary to what we're usually told, they aren't just held by a fringe minority either. Many of these countries don't have populations willing to rally en masse to support free speech and pluralism the way France did. The change has to first come from within. Raif has sacrificed a great deal to make this change happen. The world must support him and call Saudi Arabia out on its hypocrisy. Some time ago, just 50 miles east of where Raif is being held today, another dissident once spoke of change, of challenging the status quo, of radical new ideas that would ultimately transform his society. He was ostracized, persecuted, and eventually driven from his city by those wanting to kill him. He was Mohammed, the Prophet of Islam; his persecutors, the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. Muslims endeavor to emulate the life of Mohammed. Saudi Arabia has instead chosen to emulate the Quraysh. This week, Raif spent his 31st birthday imprisoned and wounded. With enough awareness, we can put enough international pressure on the Saudi government to ensure that he spends his next one with his wife and their three beautiful children.","Saudi Arabia condemned the attack on the Charlie Hebo offices in Paris as a ""cowardly terrorist act""
But Ali A. Rizvi writes that days later the Kingdom flogged blogger Raif Badawi for crimes including ""founding a liberal website""
Rizvi says the world turns a blind eye to this ""hypocrisy"" from a country where he says change needs to come from within ."
"(CNN)Indonesia has executed six people -- including five foreign nationals -- for drug offenses, setting off a diplomatic storm. Brazil and the Netherlands, whose citizens were among those executed, condemned the killings, and recalled their ambassadors to Indonesia for consultations in response. The executions, carried out by firing squad shortly after midnight Sunday local time, were the first under Indonesia's new president Joko Widodo. Citizens of Malawi, Nigeria and Vietnam were also executed, along with an Indonesian woman, officials said. Brazi's President Dilma Rousseff issued a statement expressing indignation at the execution of Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, saying the incident ""severely affected"" relations between the two countries. She also offered sympathies to Moreira's family. Rousseff ""deeply regret(ted)"" that her personal appeals for clemency, including one made via telephone, had been ignored by Widodo in proceeding with the execution, said the statement. Moreira, 53, who was caught at Jakarta airport with 13 kilograms of cocaine in 2003, was the first of his countrymen ever to be legally executed abroad, Brazilian officials said. Brazil has also been lobbying on behalf of another of its nationals facing execution in Indonesia, Rodrigo Gularte. Executions 'tragic' The Netherlands also condemned the execution of Dutch national Ang Kiem Soei, with Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Bert Koenders labeling the punishments ""tragic."" ""My sympathies go out to their families, for whom this brings a dramatic end to years of uncertainty,"" he said in a statement. Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Prime Minister Mark Rutte had made overtures to the Indonesian president on the matter, which had been a recurring talking point in the relationship between the countries in recent years, he said. ""The government has used all possible means -- legal, diplomatic and political, at bilateral and European level -- to persuade the Indonesian authorities to cancel the execution,"" he said, adding he had temporarily recalled the Dutch ambassador in response. ""Every effort has been made, up to the very highest level."" 'Regressive move' Since entering office in October as a reformer, Widodo has drawn criticism from rights groups for his vocal support of the death penalty. Last month, he publicly stated that he planned to reject the 64 appeals for clemency he had received from drug offenders on death row. The hardline approach has raised concerns for other foreign nationals sentenced to death, including the two Australian ringleaders of the so-called ""Bali Nine"" ring, arrested in 2005 with more than 8 kg of heroin. Indonesia, which has extremely strict drug laws, resumed executions in 2013 after a four year break, but no executions were carried out in 2014. Amnesty International's research director for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, Rupert Abbott, said in a statement that the executions were ""a seriously regressive move"". ""The new administration has taken office on the back of promises to make human rights a priority, but the execution of six people flies in the face of these commitments,"" he said.","Indonesia executes six people convicted of drug offenses, including five foreigners .

"Greek politicians failed to forge a coalition government Wednesday after a leftist leader huddled separately with two of his counterparts who've supported the austerity initiatives he opposes. Alexis Tsipras of Syriza met with Evangelos Venizelos of the socialist PASOK party and Antonis Samaras of center-right New Democracy a day after laying out a radical agenda he hopes to pursue if he becomes prime minister. Tsipras has until Thursday to form a government or admit defeat, but he faces an uphill task. ""At this stage there is no solution,"" PASOK's Venizelos said. ""But we must keep trying."" If no one can pull together a coalition and no national unity government can be formed by May 17, Greece must call new elections. Tsipras is the second Greek politician to try to form a government after Sunday's elections in which voters angry about tough government budget cuts punished the parties that made the cuts. His left-wing Syriza party came in second in the elections as seven parties won seats in parliament but no party captured more than 19% of the vote. The  New Democracy party placed first, but party leader Samaras gave up efforts to form a government Monday, the same day he received the mandate from President Karolos Papoulias to try to lead the country. If Syriza fails by Thursday, then it will be PASOK's chance to form a coalition government. Venizelos has said that PASOK first will support a national unity government formed by pro-European parties. If that doesn't happen, Venizelos said that PASOK would be willing to support a coalition formed of other parties as long as it would ensure Greece remains in the eurozone. Tsipras has called for the cancellation of the severe budget-cutting measures forced on the country by international lenders. Laws that cut pensions and salaries and those that ""cancel basic workers' rights"" must be annulled, Tsipras said. He also called for state control of the banks, which ""remain in the hands of the managers who bankrupted the system,"" he said. The Greek people voted clearly to reject the austerity demanded by international lenders, Tsipras said. Tsipras called on Venizelos of PASOK and Samaras of New Democracy to renounce publicly the deal they made with international lenders. Tsiprias said they ""don't have a majority any more to vote for the plundering of the Greek people."" Samaras said that the Syriza leader was doing everything possible to ensure no government would be formed. He said that Tsipras' proposals would result in Greece exiting the eurozone, the group of 17 countries that use the common European currency. Communist Party leader Aleka Papariga spoke with Tsipras by phone but will not meet him, Syriza said. Fotis Kouvelis of the Democratic Left, which splintered from Syriza in 2010, told Tsipras when they met that Syriza needed the support of more than just the left, Tsipras' bloc said. The Ecologist Greens also rejected Syriza's approach for support Tuesday, saying a road map to exit the crisis was needed. The Greek elections came the same day that French voters kicked out President Nicolas Sarkozy in favor of Socialist François Hollande, who spoke out against austerity in his victory speech. Syriza more than tripled its parliamentary representation to 51 seats out of 300 in the balloting Sunday. The election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the harsh economic austerity measures imposed in Greece. A European Commission spokeswoman said this week that Greece needs time to work through its political process but reminded the country's leaders that they would be expected to abide by terms of a bailout program meant to avoid a crippling financial meltdown. ""The commission hopes and expects that the future government of Greece will respect the engagements that Greece has entered into,"" spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen told reporters. New Democracy finished first in Sunday's voting but ended up with only 108 seats in Greece's 300-seat parliament. Voters also delivered a rebuke to PASOK -- New Democracy's socialist partner in the outgoing coalition government -- stripping the party of 119 seats. Together, the parties fell short of the 50% necessary to continue the coalition, requiring formation of a new government. Last year, Greece's debt threatened to force it to drop Europe's common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding. In exchange, they demanded that the government slash spending. The resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits -- and significant public outcry. The national unemployment rate for January, the latest month for which figures are available, was nearly 22%, prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work. Youth unemployment is even higher than the national average of one in five out of work. For two years, the country's massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the 17-country eurozone. Greece pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, worth €130 billion ($171.5 billion). The debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc, where fears that Greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as Spain and Italy. The tribulations of New Democracy and PASOK were matched by triumphs of a number of other parties that were also-rans and in some cases nonexistent just a few years ago, propelled by voters angry about stringent austerity measures.","No coalition formed after Greek leftist leader meets with two counterparts .

"Wiping away tears and choking up, President Barack Obama mourned the ""beautiful little kids"" slain Friday in a shooting massacre at a Connecticut school and called for preventing similar tragedies ""regardless of the politics."" It was a rare emotional display by Obama, known more for stoicism in such situations, and he referred to other recent U.S. mass shootings in calling for a national response. ""As a country, we have been through this too many times,"" Obama said in a brief statement to reporters at the White House about the attack at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown that killed at least 26 people, including 20 schoolchildren. ""Whether it's an elementary school in Newtown or a shopping mall in Oregon or a temple in Wisconsin or a movie theater in Aurora (Colorado) or a street corner in Chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods and these children are our children,"" said Obama, who has been criticized for being soft on gun control issues by some on the political left. Obama treads carefully on assault weapons ban . ""We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics,"" the president said. A spokesman for the the National Rifle Association, which leads the nation's powerful gun lobby, said the group had no comment ""until the facts are thoroughly known."" How do we stop the violence? Obama's statement focused mostly on the personal horror and grief that he and the nation felt at the news of another mass shooting in America, this time targeting young victims. ""I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do,"" said Obama, the father of two girls. Brushing aside tears with his left hand, he had to pause before he continued. Shooting claims young lives . ""The majority of those who died today were children -- beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old,"" the president said. ""They had their entire lives ahead of them -- birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own."" Again wiping at his eyes, Obama also noted that teachers were slain as well -- ""men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams."" ""So our hearts are broken today"" for both the families who lost loved ones as well as those whose children survived but had their innocence ""torn away from them too early,"" the president said, adding that ""there are no words that will ease their pain."" Tweets from the shooting . In an especially personal reference, Obama said on Friday night, he and the first lady ""will do what I know every parent in America will do, which is hug our children a little tighter and we'll tell them that we love them, and we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another."" ""But there are families in Connecticut who cannot do that tonight,"" he said, asking the nation to join him in providing as much help as possible to such a wounded community. ""Because while nothing can fill the space of a lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need -- to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories but also in ours,"" Obama concluded. ""May God bless the memory of the victims and, in the words of Scripture, heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds."" He then walked quickly out of the White House briefing room.

"(CNN)[Breaking news update, posted at 10:07 p.m. ET] . The New England Patriots are going to the Super Bowl for the eighth time after defeating the visiting Indianapolis Colts 45-7 in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday. The Patriots will play the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX on February 1. [Breaking news update, posted at 6:32 p.m. ET] . The defending NFL champion Seattle Seahawks downed the Green Bay Packers 28-22 in overtime, in Sunday's NFC Championship Game. The Seahawks, who beat the Broncos in last year's NFL title game, will face either the Indianapolis Colts or the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX on February 1. [Previous story, posted at 11:31 a.m. ET] . The end is near. In two weeks, the Super Bowl will be upon us. After this grandest of American sports spectacles, the salad days of basketball and baseball will follow, along with a smattering of other sports, but in the good ol' US of A, we know who is king. No, not LeBron James, silly. Football is king. These last two weeks of pro football are what every fan has been waiting for, even as a sinking feeling grows in the pit of each of their stomachs with the realization that after 12 more quarters of football, it's over till September. Conversely, wives and girlfriends, and even husbands and boyfriends, will rejoice as the football gods return their beloved -- not to mention her or his attention span -- and weekend productivity will reach peaks unseen since the summer. Soon, your loved one can finally join you on your IKEA trip for a second opinion on that bookcase. But before you get too excited, you must get through these last 14 days, and what better way to build some goodwill ahead of next month's IKEA trip than to show you care what happens? Pretending you care about the Super Bowl is easy. NFL fans are sure everyone cares about the Super Bowl, even if you're secretly hoping the men in tight pants quit throwing the brown ""ball"" around so you can see more $10 million Doritos commercials. Conference championships are another story. In fact, you may be asking, ""What's a conference championship?"" Fear not, you indifferent soul you. CNN has you covered with five things that will make you look as though you have more than the slightest idea what is happening Sunday. In the National Football Conference, the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers will face off in Seattle at 3:05 p.m. ET, while the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts will kick off the American Football Conference championship in Foxborough, Massachusetts, at 6:40 p.m. ET. What's a Seahawk? Don't ask that aloud. No one knows. But they're the defending champions after stomping the Denver Broncos in last year's Super Bowl. Want to start a fun conversation over the dip bowl? Ask how it is that Denver quarterback Peyton Manning is always mentioned among the greatest, yet with one exception, always loses at some point in the playoffs. After the heated debate dies down, you can say matter-of-factly, ""Well, at least he has a career in shilling pizza and insurance to fall back on."" Then, toss some chips in your mouth and walk off. It appears Las Vegas is not expecting much of a contest in either game. Both games are predicted to be decided by a touchdown, which is a rather large spread for a conference championship. In the regular season, the Seahawks beat the Packers by 20 points in Week 1, while the Patriots beat the Colts by 22 in Week 11, but don't pay that too much attention. Weeks can be like dog years in the NFL. Seattle is a 7- or 8-point favorite over Green Bay, which isn't that surprising given Seattle has been on a tear of late, Green Bay's quarterback is gimpy (more on that shortly) and CenturyLink Field is one of the more terrible venues to play in. They have this thing called the 12th Man, which is actually tens of thousands of astonishingly loud fans. They have their own flag, and they don't care that navy blue and neon green clash. New England is also expected to win by 7, to hear Vegas tell it. The Patriots have lost only two games since September, and one of those losses -- to the Buffalo Bills on December 28 -- may have been a product of the Pats not taking the game too seriously since they had already locked up their division. They also have Tom Terrific (aka Brady), who tends to shine in big games, though it should be noted that the Patriots have lost the last two AFC Championships and their last two Super Bowls. Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers has been getting it done since Week 4, after telling uneasy Packers fans to ""relax"" after the team got off to a 1-2 start. The Packers have lost only two games since then. Rodgers is surrounded by talent, as his offensive line (the five men resembling redwood trunks who squat in front of the quarterback before each play), running back Eddie Lacy and wide receiver Jordy Nelson have been getting it done all season. The Green Bay defense is led by Clay Matthews, who will be looking to disrupt Seattle's rushing and passing games. Look for Seattle running back and Skittles aficionado Marshawn Lynch and quarterback Russell Wilson, another insurance salesman, to make some big plays -- but in Seattle, defense reigns. You might remember cornerback Richard Sherman from his abominable sportsmanship after last year's NFC Championship, but also look for safeties Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor to be prowling the gridiron. Especially keep an eye on Chancellor. It's possible that he could've beaten the Carolina Panthers all by himself last week. That's only a slight exaggeration. In the AFC Championship, you'll want to watch Indianapolis quarterback Andrew Luck. He was the first round draft pick in 2012 -- effectively resulting in a Colts legend, Manning, leaving for Denver -- and he's been showing he is worth the hype, passing for almost 13,000 yards in his first three seasons. With little in the way of a running game, you'll see him using his tight ends a lot, while looking for wide receiver T.Y. Hilton to make big plays, something the Patriots have promised to prevent. The Patriots have a solid defense -- cornerback Darrelle Revis and linebackers Jamie Collins and Dont'a Hightower will look to make life hellish for Luck -- but they're better known for a rounded team effort on offense. Yes, Brady will be looking for the 6-foot-6 Rob Gronkowski to break free in mismatches, but expect him to spread the ball around plenty, especially to running back Jonas Gray, who showed his upside in a four-touchdown effort earlier this season ... against the Colts. In Seattle and the Boston area? Oh, most certainly. The National Weather Service on Sunday morning issued a high wind warning for northwest Washington. Winds are expected to reach speeds of up to 40 mph, with gusts up to 60 mph, but forecasters predict they will die down before kickoff. There's also about an 80% chance of rain. With the wet and the wind, the kicking and passing games could be tricky for both teams, but the Seahawks and Packers have outstanding running backs in Lynch and Lacy, so that may make life easier for them. On the plus side, it will be in the high 40s or low 50s throughout the game, so they won't be battling bitter cold. It will be a little colder in Foxborough for the AFC Championship, but not much -- somewhere in the mid-40s. The Boston area also has a good chance of rain, and winds will be moving at around 15 mph. Though Brady and Luck are both skilled ball handlers -- and both ply their trade in chilly locales -- there's always the possibility that the wind and rain will make for a sloppy game, especially when you consider neither team has the safety net of an awesome running back. Maybe you've heard the phase, ""Aaron Rodgers' leg,"" in recent days? Or perhaps ad nauseam? Yes, it would be hard for even the most disinterested of fans to have missed the news that Rodgers' calf is torn. How badly is unclear, but the Seahawks' Thomas has said he isn't buying the line coming out of the Packers camp. What's clear is that Rodgers was far from mobile in last week's game against the Dallas Cowboys. Despite Rodgers hobbling around in the pocket, the Cowboys failed to put pressure on him -- especially in the fourth quarter -- as the one-legged wonder completed 24 of 35 passes for 316 yards and tossed three touchdowns. Don't expect Seattle's defensive players to be so merciful. Expect them to bring the house -- and often -- against Rodgers and try to knock him down on every play. And don't expect the Legion of Boom to go any easier on his receivers or on Lacy, who has been complaining of knee soreness ahead of Sunday's matchup. In Foxborough, you'll have a more traditional story line in the old guard versus the new. Brady, of course, is the poster boy for winners -- and not because of the UGG boots contract and being married to Gisele Bundchen. Since coming to the NFL in 2001, he's played in five Super Bowls and won three of them. This will be his ninth AFC Championship game. But remember, he's lost his last two conference championships and his last two Super Bowls, so don't be surprised when commentators wonder aloud if Luck, 25, who has taken the Colts to the playoffs in each of his three seasons, is ready to take the crown from the 37-year-old Brady's head.

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- Many southerners are voting for an independent Sudan this week, thirsting for freedom from the north. They equate sharia or Islamic law that President Omar al-Bashir has vowed to strengthen with slavery. Al-Bashir has declared that if Southern Sudan votes in favor of separation, sharia will become the main source of Sudan's Constitution, Islam the state religion and Arabic the official language. Many in the north are embracing al-Bashir's pledge. Newspaper publisher Al-Tayib Mustafa said he will be happy to see his nation break in two. Islam, he said, comes above all else. ""When the south goes, then the north will be Muslim,"" he said. ""For a Muslim, unity is not as important as religion. Sharia is religion. Sharia is Islam."" But there are other faces of Islam in Sudan, including a Sufi community, and Mustafa's position is hardly shared by all Sudanese. Some in the north consider themselves Arabs, others Africans. They speak a dozen different languages, and while a majority of people are Muslims, a significant number are Christians or practice traditional religions. Sharia already is the law of the land in northern Sudan, but Sudanese authorities have relaxed its enforcement since 2005 when a peace treaty ended more than 20 years of civil war. The war pitted a northern government of Arab Muslims against blacks in Southern Sudan who practice Christianity and animist religions. It killed 2 million people and displaced several million others, mainly from Southern Sudan. The president's comments have stirred fear that the government will implement sharia for the hundreds of thousands of southerners and other non-Muslims in northern Sudan, including many who fled fighting, disease and famine in the south. Even many Muslims find the imposition of Islamic law troubling, and it's even more disturbing for the small and ancient Christian community in the north. ""We as Christians, we feel that Christianity is a Sudanese religion and should be respected,"" said Bishop Ezekiel Kondo, who oversees Khartoum's Episcopal Church and chairs the Sudan Council of Churches. Al-Bashir's vow to strengthen Islamic law came as a shock to Kondo. ""As a church we are not happy with what he said, and we feel as the president -- he is the president for everyone in the country -- he knows very well that there are other religious communities."" But Mohammed Othman Salih, secretary-general of the Sudanese Muslim Clerics Council, brushed aside such concerns. ""The Islamic sharia guarantees the rights of non-Muslims better than secular laws,"" he said. ""Why? Because it's an issue of a religious duty, and they are human rights sanctified by God almighty.""","Sudan's president has pledged to strengthen sharia, or Islamic law .

"While President Barack Obama held a news conference on Thursday where he announced an administrative fix to the Affordable Care Act, it quickly digressed into a confession and apology hour. He took the blame. He called the rollout of Obamacare ""rough."" He said he ""fumbled."" He said the problems are ""on me."" He also offered an olive branch to his colleagues on Capitol Hill and acknowledged his party's tough circumstances. ""There is no doubt that our failure to roll out the ACA smoothly has put a burden on Democrats, whether they're running or not, because they stood up and supported this,"" Obama said. Can Congress really save insurance plans lost under Obamacare? ""I feel deeply responsible for making it harder for them, rather than easier for them,"" he added. It's tough to be a Democrat now . Less than a month after the government shutdown during which the Republican Party seemed doomed for a generation -- or at least through 2014 -- the Democrats are now nervously tapping wondering what went so miserably wrong. The botched Obamacare rollout has put political pressure on the Democratic Party as members backed the President health care agenda as he said on Thursday ""through thick and thin."" Obama's self-deprecating confession, combined with his administrative ""fix"" to allow people in the individual market to keep their current insurance plans, did not, however, completely alleviate concerns of Democratic lawmakers. Obama unveiled remedies for people whose insurance plans have been canceled, despite repeated assurances that if you like your plan you can keep it. He said the federal government ""isn't going to get in the way"" of insurance companies offering plans to existing customers in the individual insurance market that don't meet minimum coverage requirements. Frayed nerves . For instance, Senator Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, said she is still going to push her legislation that would also address the problem. And Senator Kay Hagan, D- North Carolina, told CNN she is inclined to support Landrieu's bill. It goes a little bit further and has more teeth. Obamacare rattling Democratic nerves . Both Landrieu and Hagan are up for re-election next year. They are not alone. A handful of other Democratic Senators have to tread carefully as do dozens of Democratic House members. The President's announcement came as Democrats repeatedly rang alarm bells over the canceled plans. Former President Bill Clinton chimed in, saying Obama should keep his promise. Some Democrats say it doesn't go far enough because the onus is on insurance companies and state insurance commissioners to extend the plans for an additional year. The insurance trade lobby, America's Health Insurance Plans, released a statement saying the last-minute changes could ""destabilize the market and result in higher premiums."" Many in Congress avoiding Obamacare exchange . Insurance cancellations exist on top of a troubled website and lower-than-expected enrollment figures. The real test on whether Obama alleviated Democratic concerns will be if Democrats back a Republican proposal Friday by Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan that would largely undermine Obamacare. Upton's bill would allow affected insurance plans to extend into next year and gut a major part of the Affordable Care Act by allowing anyone -- not just the 5% of people in the individual market place - to purchase low-coverage plans. Obamacare prohibits discrimination for preexisting conditions and mandates coverage for mental health, prenatal care and other issues. This is a primary reason why insurance companies are dropping existing coverage. Trust . With the problems facing Obamacare, public opinion of the President has declined. His approval rating among American voters has dropped to its lowest number in a Quinnipiac University polling since he became President with new doubts being raised about trust. Fifty two percent of respondents said the President is not trustworthy. Obama appeared to understand the severity. ""I am not a perfect man and I will not be a perfect President, but I'll wake up every single day working as hard as I can on behalf of Americans out there,"" he said. Obamacare promises: Where things stand . CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley said Obama's diminished trustworthiness will make the remaining implementation of Obamacare challenging. ""It's going to be more and more difficult every day,"" Crowley said.","Obama says he feels ""deeply responsible"" for political fallout Democrats face .

"(CNN) -- The officer involved in a New Year's Day shooting that left a passenger dead in a crowded Oakland, California, subway station resigned Wednesday, a Bay Area Rapid Transit spokesman said. Oscar Grant, 22, was killed January 1 in a shooting at a subway station in California's Bay Area. BART spokesman Linton Johnson said in a statement that the officer's attorney and his union representative submitted the resignation at a meeting Wednesday morning with BART police investigators. The resignation was effective immediately. In the statement, Johnson said the officer's attorney had postponed a meeting with investigators Monday and on Tuesday asked for a delay until next week. That request was denied, and the Wednesday meeting was scheduled. The officer did not show, Johnson said. Shortly before the funeral for the passenger, 22-year-old Oscar Grant, on Wednesday, Johnson said Mehserle had been moved at least twice because of death threats to him and his family. The BART officer fatally shot Grant in the back after he and some friends were pulled from a train car following a report of an altercation, according to a BART statement. On Tuesday, attorney John Burris filed a $25 million claim with BART in which he identified the officer as Johannes Mehserle. Several local media outlets had already identified the officer. Burris alleges in the claim, ""Without so much as flinching the Officer Mehserle stood over Grant and mercilessly fired his weapon, mortally wounding Mr. Grant with a single gunshot wound to the back.""  Watch the events preceding the shooting » . Johnson said Mehserle's attorney -- reportedly David E. Mastagni of Sacramento -- has advised him not to speak to investigators. Nor has Mehserle made any public statements. An attorney in Mastagni's office, Christopher Miller, confirmed the resignation Wednesday, saying Mehserle had the support of the BART Police Officers' Association. CNN affiliate KTVU-TV in Oakland obtained videos of the incident and its prelude. One video, which KTVU reported came from a train passenger who wished not to be identified, shows three young men against a wall in the Fruitvale station. Burris told CNN on Tuesday that the young men had been celebrating the new year at a popular waterfront tourist spot, The Embarcadero. They were heading home when police pulled them from the train car about 2 a.m. Some of the young men were handcuffed, but not 22-year-old Oscar Grant. The video from the anonymous passenger shows Grant seated on the floor with his back against the wall. iReport.com: BART protests turn violent . Grant holds up his hands, appearing to plead with police. Burris said Tuesday that Grant was asking police not to use a Taser. ""He said to them, 'Don't Tase me; I have a 4-year-old daughter,' "" Burris said. The interaction on the video is not audible. Seconds later, police put Grant face-down on the ground. Grant appears to struggle. One of the officers kneels on Grant as another officer stands, tugs at his gun, unholsters it and fires a shot into Grant's back. Burris said the bullet went through Grant's back and then ricocheted off the floor and through his lungs. Grant died seven hours later at a hospital, KTVU reported. In Wednesday's statement about Mehserle's resignation, BART General Manager Dorothy Dugger said that the ""shooting is a tragic event in every respect for all involved."" ""We recognize that the family and friends of Oscar Grant are in mourning, and we extend our condolences,"" she said. Johnson has said Mehserle, who had been on the force two years, is devastated and is presumed innocent. He also says that the videos making the media rounds are inconclusive and that there is more to the story than what can be seen on the grainy images. There are two surveillance cameras at the Fruitvale station, but a BART official said Tuesday that no video is being released at this time. Burris called the shooting ""unconscionable"" and said the $25 million claim alleges wrongful death and violation of civil rights by use of excessive force. Read the claim (PDF) BART has 45 days to respond, he said. If the authority rejects the claim, he will file a civil lawsuit, said Burris, who served as Rodney King's co-counsel in King's civil case against the Los Angeles Police Department in the 1990s. Burris has spoken to witnesses who claim that Grant was trying to resolve the situation. ""He had been telling people to calm down. 'Be cool. Just do what they tell you to do,' "" the attorney said. Johnson told KTVU that authorities are trying to determine whether Mehserle accidentally drew his gun instead of his Taser. Burris said he is pushing Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff to press second-degree murder charges, or involuntary manslaughter charges if evidence suggests that Mehserle mistook his gun for a Taser, he said. ""No one wants to believe a cop would just kill somebody like that,"" he said. ""My view is, this is criminal conduct, period."" Orloff said Wednesday that his investigation will focus primarily on what led to the shooting. Some homicides are lawful, he noted. In this case, Orloff said, ""the part that needs dissecting is what, if anything, can be determined about the mental state of the actor,"" meaning the officer. There are many possibilities, he said: His office could find no basis for criminal charges; the office could file involuntary manslaughter charges if Mehserle exercised gross negligence, voluntary manslaughter if Mehserle reasonably believed that he was acting in self-defense or murder if Mehserle acted with malice and forethought. ""Our function is to determine whether or not criminal charges should be filed against the officer,"" he said. ""These things are usually an issue of weeks rather than days."" BART Police Chief Gary Gee released a statement this week expressing condolences for Grant's family and saying the authority is cooperating with Orloff's office. Gee added that BART will complete an ""unbiased and thorough investigation"" and asked the public to be patient. ""As frustrating as it is, I want to stress that we cannot and will not jeopardize this case by discussing details before the investigation is complete,"" Gee said. Johnson told CNN on Wednesday that it could take weeks for BART to complete its investigation. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Augie Martin and Dan Simon contributed to this report.","Officer's attorney, union representative submit officer's letter of resignation .

"Drinking a daily cup of coffee -- or even several cups -- isn't likely to harm your health, and it may even lower your risk of dying from chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests. The relationship between coffee drinking and health has been a hot topic in recent years, but research has produced mixed results. Some studies have linked coffee consumption to better health and a lower risk of premature death, while others suggest that coffee -- or rather caffeine -- might contribute to heart disease through negative effects on blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate. The new study is by far the largest of its kind to date. As part of a joint project with the AARP, researchers from the National Institutes of Health followed more than 400,000 healthy men and women between the ages of 50 and 71 for up to 13 years, during which 13% of the participants died. Health.com: Big perks -- coffee's health benefits . Overall, coffee drinkers were less likely than their peers to die during the study, and the more coffee they drank, the lower their mortality risk tended to be. Compared with people who drank no coffee at all, men and women who drank six or more cups per day were 10% and 15% less likely, respectively, to die during the study. This pattern held when the researchers broke out the data by specific causes of death, including heart disease, lung disease, pneumonia,stroke, diabetes, infections, and even injuries and accidents. Cancer was the only major cause of death not associated with coffee consumption. ""There has been some concern that coffee might increase the risk of death, and this provides some reassurance against that worry,"" says Neal D. Freedman, Ph.D., the lead author of the study and an investigator with the division of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the National Cancer Institute, in Rockville, Maryland. Health.com: Trying to cut back on coffee? Here's how . Even moderate coffee consumption was linked to better survival odds. Drinking a single cup per day -- which was much more common than a six-cup-a-day habit -- was associated with a 6% lower risk of dying among men and a 5% lower risk among women. Although these reductions in risk might seem modest, they could have potentially dramatic implications for public health if spread out over the tens of millions of coffee drinkers in the United States, says Susan Fisher, Ph.D., chair of community and preventive medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center, in Rochester, New York. ""Even a small decrease, when you're talking about a [behavior] that is so ubiquitous across the human population, could mean many, many lives saved,"" Fisher says. Health.com: Is coffee healthier than you think? The findings, however, stop short of saying that coffee drinking directly lowers the risk of chronic disease. Like much of the previous research on coffee, the study was based on survey data -- in this case, a single questionnaire distributed in the mid-1990s -- that may provide an incomplete picture of the participants' overall health and lifestyle. Although the researchers took into account a wide range of extenuating factors, including diet and exercise regimens, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and marital status, it's possible that people who drink coffee differ from the rest of the population in as-yet unidentified ways that make them less vulnerable to disease and early death. The explanation for the study findings ""might not specifically be the coffee,"" Fisher says. ""It might be some characteristic of the coffee drinker."" Health.com: Surprising sources of caffeine . Still, it's plausible that coffee drinking actually improves health. Coffee contains some 1,000 compounds, many of which are health-promoting antioxidants, Freedman says. ""There's some data showing that some of these components may prevent insulin resistance and have a role in diabetes,"" he says. In the study, both regular and decaf were associated with a lower risk of dying, which suggests that these and other substances in coffee might be more important than caffeine. But even decaf contains trace amounts of caffeine, so the authors can't entirely rule out the possibility that caffeine has an effect on health, Freedman says.","Daily cup may lower risk of dying from chronic diseases such as diabetes .

"Skype users soon will be able to expand the list of people they can connect with, says Microsoft, owner of the popular Web-chat tool. Still in its early stages of development, Skype Translator, as it's being called for now, will provide voice and text language translation for calls between people speaking different languages. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Gurdeep Pall, the vice president in charge of Skype, demonstrated the technology Tuesday night in California at the Code Conference, sponsored by tech-news site Re/Code. ""It is going to make sure you can communicate with anybody without language barriers,"" Nadella said at the gathering in suburban Los Angeles. ""In fact, it's the most human of things."" At the demo, Pall, speaking English, and a colleague speaking German conducted a Skype video call. There were a couple of instances when the voice and text translation mixed up minor parts of a sentence, but overall it appeared to be spot on. The conversation was no simple ""Hello, how are you?"" either. It centered on Pall's plans to move to London and included the names of streets and neighborhoods in that city as well as discussion of his colleague's visits to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The two would speak, then wait while the program translated what was just said. ""It is early days for this technology, but the 'Star Trek' vision for a Universal Translator isn't a galaxy away, and its potential is every bit as exciting as those 'Star Trek' examples,"" Pall said in a blog post. ""Skype Translator opens up so many possibilities to make meaningful connections in ways you never could before in education, diplomacy, multilingual families and in business."" After a short delay, the system posts one user's translated comments as text onscreen to the other user while a synthetic voice speaks them aloud. Pall said Skype Translator will be available first as a Windows 8 beta app by the end of this year. Microsoft purchased London-based Skype, which has 300 million monthly users, in 2011. But Nadella said the translation technology the program uses has been in development at Microsoft for 15 years. And, in another development straight out of science fiction, he said the current version is surprising even its creators. ""Say you teach it English. It learns English,"" he said. ""Then you teach it Mandarin. It learns Mandarin, but it becomes better at English. And then you teach it Spanish. It gets good at Spanish, but it gets great at both Mandarin and English -- and, quite frankly, none of us know exactly why. ""It's brain-like in the sense of its capability to learn. It's magical.""","The heads of Microsoft and Skype show off a new language-translation tool .

"In the days since Michael Brown was shot and killed, protests have filled the streets in Ferguson. But beyond the signs, marchers and tear gas, there's the pain and grief of a family. It's a pain Sybrina Fulton knows all too well. ""I wish I had a word of automatic comfort, but I don't,"" she writes in an open letter to Brown's parents. Fulton has been there. She, too, lost a son in a shooting death that also triggered protests and outrage. Her son was Trayvon Martin. ""I hate that you and your family must join this exclusive yet growing group of parents and relatives who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence,"" she writes in the letter published in Time magazine. ""But Michael is much more than a police/gun violence case; Michael is your son."" Two and a half years ago on February 27, 2012, Fulton's son was shot and killed in Florida by George Zimmerman, a volunteer neighborhood watch captain. The case quickly drew national attention as weeks went by without formal charges. President Barack Obama publicly addressed the case, as he has in the Brown shooting. And as is the case with the Brown shooting, protests in support of Trayvon and his family spread nationwide. Zimmerman was charged on April 11, 2012. Then in July of 2013, he was found not guilty of second degree murder. In the Brown shooting, a grand jury may begin to hear testimony as early as Wednesday and decide on whether to return an indictment against the police officer who killed him, Darren Wilson. Claims of character assassination . Meanwhile, key questions in the case remain unanswered and a debate over what we do know plays out in public. Police have released video of Brown taking part in an alleged convenience store robbery, and a purported friend of the Wilson called into a local radio station claiming that Brown attacked the officer and disobeyed an order to freeze. It's an account that a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation later told CNN matches what Wilson himself has told investigators. However, both the video and the account of events contrast sharply with what witnesses and family members have said about the incident and Brown's character. Perhaps in reference to this public debate, Fulton writes the Browns will ""hear character assassinations about Michael which I am certain you already have."" She adds, ""This will incense and insult you. All of this will happen before and continue long after you have had the chance to lay your son to rest."" ""Honor your son and his life, not the circumstances of his alleged transgression,"" Fulton writes. ""I have always said that Trayvon was not perfect. But no one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered. No one can convince you that Michael deserved to be executed."" Fulton pledges that ""neither of their lives shall be in vain"" and ends her letter with a fiery call to action. ""If they refuse to hear us, we will make them feel us.""

"Tour bus driver Rasoul Mousavi has been seeing less and less of his wife this month. Mousavi says a sharp increase in tourists has kept him so busy that for four nights in a row he did something his wife doesn't like very much -- he showed up late for dinner. ""My wife isn't very happy but during the past few years, I've rarely seen it this busy,"" Mousavi said. ""Thank God it's getting better. We're getting more tourists."" Mousavi's heavy workload comes amid a push by Iran's new president Hassan Rouhani to attract more foreign travelers to Iran, home to some of the world's oldest civilizations and historical sites that date back several thousand years. Iranian officials have announced plans to ease visa requirements for most foreign visitors within the next several months. According to state media, once the new visa guidelines are in place, tourists from most countries will be able to pick up their visas on arrival, with the exception of travelers from at least ten countries -- including the U.S. and the UK. Iran used to be a top destination in the region, but the 1979 Iranian revolution delivered a huge blow to the tourism industry. The number of tourists dropped sharply, due in large part to Iran's political and economic isolation and warnings by Western governments that Iran was a rogue and dangerous nation led by a radical regime . President Rouhani is clearly looking to leave a more positive impression on the international community with a campaign to solve Iran's nuclear dispute and improve relations with the West. According to the Iranian Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts Organization, Iran attracted roughly four million tourists last year and generated about $8 billion in revenue. Tourism officials predict less restrictive visa guidelines and Rouhani's policy of moderation will help those numbers increase significantly. ""The number of tourists has been increasing day by day and we're feeling the increase,"" says Mohammad Eslami, a tour guide for the Tehran-based Azadi International Tourism Organization. On a typical day in Tehran it's not hard to find tour buses filled with tourists weaving through the capital's historic neighborhoods. ""People are amazingly warm and generous here. It's been a wonderful,"" says Ryan Hendricks, who is visiting Iran with his wife and daughter from the Netherlands. ""What we see of Iran on TV news is not true,"" says Finnish tourist Janna Kauppinn. ""This is a country full of history with wonderful people and amazing food."" The apparent comeback in Iran's tourism industry could mean more late nights for Mousavi. But the tour bus driver says that as long as tourists keep coming and helping the economy and leaving with fond memories, that's perfectly fine with him and his wife. ""I really shed tears of joy because they come here and see Iran, and they leave with pride,"" he says.","Long-isolated Iran to ease visa requirements amid tourism boom .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The more often Americans go to church, the more likely they are to support the torture of suspected terrorists, according to a new survey. The Washington Region Religious Campaign Against Torture rallied on Capitol Hill in March 2008. More than half of people who attend services at least once a week -- 54 percent -- said the use of torture against suspected terrorists is ""often"" or ""sometimes"" justified. Only 42 percent of people who ""seldom or never"" go to services agreed, according to the analysis released Wednesday by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. White evangelical Protestants were the religious group most likely to say torture is often or sometimes justified -- more than six in 10 supported it. People unaffiliated with any religious organization were least likely to back it. Only four in 10 of them did. The analysis is based on a Pew Research Center survey of 742 American adults conducted April 14-21. It did not include analysis of groups other than white evangelicals, white non-Hispanic Catholics, white mainline Protestants and the religiously unaffiliated, because the sample size was too small.  See results of the survey » . The president of the National Association of Evangelicals, Leith Anderson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The survey asked: ""Do you think the use of torture against suspected terrorists in order to gain important information can often be justified, sometimes be justified, rarely be justified, or never be justified?"" Roughly half of all respondents -- 49 percent -- said it is often or sometimes justified. A quarter said it never is. The religious group most likely to say torture is never justified was Protestant denominations -- such as Episcopalians, Lutherans and Presbyterians -- categorized as ""mainline"" Protestants, in contrast to evangelicals. Just over three in 10 of them said torture is never justified. A quarter of the religiously unaffiliated said the same, compared with two in 10 white non-Hispanic Catholics and one in eight evangelicals.","742 American adults surveyed on use of torture against suspected terrorists .

"Days after he fatally shot an unarmed black teen in August, Officer Darren Wilson was cutting grass when he was told his home address was circulating online. Within three hours, he'd grabbed some bags and gone into hiding, according to his attorneys. ""He had to leave the grass, literally, half mowed,"" his lawyer, Neil Bruntrager, told CNN's Don Lemon late Wednesday. Since then, he's stayed under the radar by moving from house to house, including briefly living with one of his lawyers, and  spending time watching movies in dark theaters to avoid detection. Wilson says he's sorry but his conscience is clear . 'Not a question of if ... but when' His lawyers revealed details about his time in hiding to CNN and The Washington Post newspaper Wednesday. They told CNN that Wilson is in talks to leave the Ferguson Police Department and may give up being an officer altogether -- after a grand jury decided not to indict him in the death of Michael Brown. ""It's not a question of if, it's a question of when,"" Bruntrager said about his leaving the Police Department. Bruntrager confirmed what CNN originally reported last week. His time in hiding . Wilson's shooting of the teen sparked days of sometimes violent protests in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. As a result, the officer's address was shared online, forcing him to flee his home, his attorneys said. ""There were death threats out against him,""  Bruntrager said. ""There were bounties that had been placed upon his life."" His client, he said, resorted to various measures to hide his identity. ""He's had to learn to live in a way that makes him completely unnoticeable. As a consequence, there are several techniques that he utilizes that make that happen,""  Bruntrager said without elaborating. ""It's an odd way to live your life. But for him, it's all about his family."" Except for his getting married last month, Bruntrager told The Washington Post on Wednesday that Wilson mostly stayed out of the public eye. Wilson preferred going to the movies because it was dark, Bruntrager told the paper, jokingly saying that the officer ""cross-dressed a lot."" Keeping him safe was the first priority, he said. Future uncertain . Immediately after the shooting, Wilson maintained that he wanted to return to his job as a police officer, his lawyers said. But his officer days may be behind him. ""Realistically, he can't go back to being a police officer,"" Bruntrager said. ""He knows that. There's no illusion about any of this. But it's the way in which he leaves ... that's important to him on different levels."" ""We want to make sure when he does, it's amicable,"" he told CNN. ""He's on paid leave, and there are discussions that are going on right now to separate from the department in an amicable fashion."" Another attorney told The Post that Wilson's safety had a lot to do with his decision to leave. ""I think I expressed to him, 'Do you realize your first call (back on the job) will be to a blind alley where you're executed?' He took a pause for a minute, thought about it and said, 'Oh.' That is the reality,"" his attorney, James Towey, told the paper. Wilson, 28, spent six years with the Ferguson Police Department before being placed on leave after the shooting on August 9. Before his stint in Ferguson, he worked for two years at another police department. Last week, CNN reported that Wilson told associates he would resign to help ease pressure and protect his fellow officers. Wilson had expressed concern about resigning while the grand jury was hearing evidence for fear it would appear he was admitting fault. His many interviews . Wilson has said he killed the 18-year-old out of fear for his life during their encounter. He maintains he did nothing wrong and was forced to shoot Brown after the teen attacked him and tried to take his gun. ""I just felt the immense power that he had. And then the way I've described it is, it was like a 5-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan,"" Wilson told ABC News on Tuesday. ""That's just how big this man was. He was very large, very powerful man."" His lawyers said his story has remained the same throughout. ""I met Darren Wilson approximately one hour after the incident,"" his attorney, Greg Kleoppel, told CNN. ""That statement has been consistent  one hour after the shooting, the following interview with the St. Louis County detective and on August 10 when it was recorded at the St. Louis County Police Department."" Bruntrager said the officer went through a series of interviews. ""Before he testified before the grand jury, he was also interviewed by the FBI and the Justice Department. They came in and gave him an exceedingly rigorous interview, where they didn't leave any question unasked,"" he said. Called a 'murderer' Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., didn't mince words when he spoke about the officer. He described him as a ""murderer"" during an interview with CNN. ""He understood his actions. He understood exactly what he was doing. You know, he didn't have a second thought, a pushback thought, or nothing. He was intending to kill someone. That's how I look at it,""  the elder Brown said. ""He was going to kill someone at that point."" Next steps . Wilson's legal fights may not be over. There's a federal investigation under way. ""So we have a civil rights charge potentially down the road,"" Kleoppel told CNN. ""However, that's going to be very difficult to prove, because on a civil rights violation, you must prove that he intended to violate an individual's rights, and in this case, his life. Civil suit ... we'll have to wait and see."" But his legal issues are the least of Wilson's worries. ""He still has to deal with so many other issues because of all this,"" Bruntrager said. 'Sorry for your loss' Though he has not said much, Wilson sympathizes with Brown's family, his lawyers said. ""His remorse and his sadness about what happened is there, and it's real,""  Bruntrager told CNN. ""But in respect to the Browns, he's been very careful to sort of stand back. He knows that whatever he says, it's not going to be read as he means it. He thought it's better to say, 'I'm sorry for your loss.' It's simple, but it's direct. And if you knew him, you'd understand that's the kind of guy he is."" Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson .","Lawyer: Wilson may give up being an officer altogether .

"(Mashable)  -- With about 2,400 four-year universities located in the U.S., high school students may find the actual process of applying to college as anxiety inducing as waiting for an acceptance letter. Startup Splash Networks wants to make selecting schools to send an application to easier. On Tuesday, the company is launching a Facebook app called AdmissionSplash that shows prospective college students how likely it is that they will be admitted to each school on their lists. The app asks students for their basic information: test scores, address, and other factors that affect admissions, like whether they volunteer or play sports. It then uses an algorithm to give users a desirability rating as well as the likelihood, ranging from ""very poor"" to ""very good,"" of getting into the schools. Admission Splash currently runs customized equations for about 1,500 schools that it developed using the admission data they release. Admissions offices often paint a picture of case-by-case application analysis that can't be narrowed down to an equation. ""Although high school grade point average and standardized test scores are important indicators of academic achievement used in UCLA's admissions review, they only tell part of the story,"" advertises UCLA's prospective student website, for instance. But AdmissionSplash's equation, which definitely doesn't take essays into account, has been pretty accurate in tests that use publicly available admissions profiles. In the case of UCLA, approximately 85% of students the app said would get admitted actually did. The sample sizes of these tests are fairly small (73 people for the UCLA test), so I wouldn't suggest posting AdmissionSplash results on one's Facebook page before getting an acceptance letter. Using the tool as a way to compare schools' competitiveness or to share a list of prospective schools with friends, on the other hand, seems like a win. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"The images are shocking. A man apparently wielding an ax looms over a figure lying spreadeagled on the cobbled road, clad in red overalls. The first man turns to face the camera as it passes and watches, ax in hand, as it drives into the distance. Almost more disturbingly, swiveling around on Google Street View, a man stands watching the grisly scene, hand nonchalantly resting on his hip. All three faces are blurred. But the identities of the two men at the center of the tableau are far from a secret in this corner of Edinburgh. The man lying seemingly lifeless on the ground is Dan Thompson, who has owned and run the Tomson Motor Company on Giles Street -- in the Edinburgh district of Leith -- for 30 years. Above him, longtime employee Gary Kerr. Zoom closer and, through the distortion, Kerr's expression could make you shudder. The ""axman"" is laughing. His boss and apparent victim is chuckling too, when he describes the hoax to CNN. Thompson and Kerr have been at the center of much media attention in Britain after a local newspaper picked up the story of their Google Street View ""murder."" But it took a while. The photos, Thompson reckons, were taken around August 2012. ""Giles Street is like a misshapen horseshoe. By chance, I saw the Street View car going in other leg. I knew it would reach us in half a minute,"" he says. ""I had just enough time to whip in, grab Gary and a pick-ax handle and he came out to give me a so called 'Leith massage,' which is essentially being bashed."" Kerr has worked at the Tomson Motor Company for more than a decade, and was ""right up"" for the prank, Thompson said. He said Google had apparently uploaded the images and some months later the company was alerted when one of its suppliers rang it up ""in fits of laughter."" Thompson said it was more than a year before someone apparently alerted the police, who he says ""very properly"" came around to check out the incident. ""A WPC [female police officer] has her car serviced here and she said 'I know exactly what's going on here -- it's a  wind up.' ""They came in and said 'you guys, do you happen to know anything about this?' We explained what had happened,"" Thompson said. ""They were smiling when they came in and were roaring with laughter when they left."" Thompson said that he hadn't heard from Google about the prank but speculated that the publicity it had generated would be very good for the company. ""It's nothing obscene, but now a lot more people know about Street View -- so I would think this must be a joy to them."" When CNN contacted Google about the prank, the company declined to comment. Thompson fears that his tableau may not be long for the cyberworld. ""Infuriatingly I think last Thursday the Street View car went past and we hadn't set anything up,"" he said. ""I expect there will ll be a lot of copycats of this now but the trick is spotting [the Street View car] in time."" As for the police, they told CNN they would ""always respond to any reports of concern for personal safety.""","Images of Edinburgh's Giles Street on Google Street View appear to show an axe murder .

"Throw down some drinks at The Mad Hatter bar in Orlando? Check. Pull the fire alarm, so about 500 students in Tower 1 on the University of Central Florida campus rush outside, together? Done. Give them hell? Those three words were the last item of James Oliver Seevakumaran's checklist that he made before, authorities say, he would go out with up to 1,000 rounds of ammunition and start shooting, possibly setting off bombs in the process. It was not crossed off. Instead of a mass killing early Monday morning, police reported only one fatality: Seevakumaran. Video released a day later by University of Central Florida police shows the moment officers discovered him. After getting into his suite, they unlocked his room's door and barged in, yelling and with their weapons raised. It didn't take them long to realize there was no threat. The 30-year-old lay prone on the floor, having killed himself with a handgun. ""All indications are, just like the rest of his life, he was alone,"" UCF police Chief Richard Beary said Tuesday. After just more than a day of investigating, authorities have been able to piece together much of what happened. They have seen surveillance video that shows Seevakumaran pulling the alarm, then returning to his room. They recovered weapons and ammunition as well as four homemade bombs and the checklist. They interviewed many who described him as a loner who didn't like to talk to others but wasn't viewed as a threat. What they don't know is why he did what he did. ""There's no manifesto, there's no documentation,"" Beary said. ""... We have not uncovered anything that would give us a motive or a rationale."" Family calls him 'a loner' The statement issued Tuesday by Seevakumaran's family, initially to the Sarasota County, Florida, sheriff's office, didn't shed much light on his thinking. ""The family of James Oliver Seevakumaran states that James was a loner and did not have a history of violence,"" they said. From fall 2010 through fall 2012, he had been a UCF student. But he was not enrolled for the spring semester, and was in the process of being removed from the dorm room where he lived, school spokesman Grant Heston said. According to Heston, Seevakumaran was never seen by UCF counselors and had not had any student conduct issues. He had one prior contact with law enforcement -- a traffic arrest in 2006 -- the police chief said. One of his roommates, Arabo ""BK"" Babakhani, told the UCF student news organization the Knightly News that Seevakumaran would seemingly make an effort to avoid walking near him, that he wouldn't say anything back when you said hello. ""The only time that he made solid eye contact with me was when he was pulling the gun on me,"" the roommate said. That happened as lights were flashing and the alarm was ringing around 12:20 a.m. Monday, inside their suite. Unsure if he could make it to the hallway, Babakhani ran to his room as Seevakumaran raised what he later described as a ""large assault gun"" in his direction. ""I just slammed the door,"" the roommate told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night. ""I was not going to let him shoot me."" Babakhani said he first locked his door, hid behind a chest of drawers, then got behind a cabinet in the bathroom and called 911. ""My roommate just pulled a fire alarm, and he's got a gun out,"" he told the dispatcher. While realizing Seevakumaran was far from a rah-rah college student, Babakhani didn't consider him a threat. But in retrospect, the roommate did say he believed Seevakumaran was having money problems from having had his hours cut at a job and that, with seemingly no one to turn to, he might have like he was ""in a corner."" ""I just thought that he kept to himself a lot,"" he said, according to audio posted on the Knightly News website. ""I just thought he was a quiet, introverted person."" 'I don't think you do that as a joke' Whatever his relatives and acquaintances thought of him, police said they believe that Seevakumaran had devious plans of his own. Waiting for him in the university mail room were two 22-round magazine clips for his semi-automatic rifle, a sling for that weapon, and a training DVD on how to use its laser and shoot it, authorities discovered Tuesday. This is in addition to the ample ammunition -- including drum magazines, one of them found attached to the gun, that can contain 110 bullets each -- that authorities have found. Then there were the bombs, which Beary said he believes Seevakumaran made himself . Seevakumaran likely spent about $1,000 to buy the guns and ammunition in February, suggesting his plan was set in motion as early as then, the police chief said. Of course, there also was the checklist he'd drawn up -- and largely followed, albeit apparently hours later than he had planned, after scribbling out items such as ""get drunk"" and ""take shower"" -- ahead of his death. ""I don't think ... you purchase 1,000 rounds of ammunition"" without a plan, Beary said. ""I don't think you do that as a joke."" While Seevakumaran is the only one dead, the mere possibility that he would wage an attack has already had an impact. Dorms were evacuated, classes were canceled, and the UCF campus was shut down. Counselors were in Tower 1 and elsewhere to talk with students coming to grips with the drama. School authorities couldn't promise that something like this wouldn't happen again, but they did send out more police on patrol to help students feel safe. ""All of us have a role to play in the welfare of our campus,"" school President John C. Hitt said Tuesday in a statement, ""and we will work together to use this experience to make us even more prepared, more alert, and more secure.","James Seevakumaran's roommate says, ""I was not going to let him shoot me""

"(CNN) -- You've probably heard of Glorious Goodwood -- well, this is more like glorious driftwood. Galloping along beaches or drinking quietly from a pool, these majestic horses aren't what they first seem. That's because, not that long ago, they were just piles of what seemed like scrap wood -- until, that is, artist James Doran-Webb began working his magic. Born in Birmingham, the 46-year-old has lived in the Philippines since traveling there for what was supposed to have been an extended holiday in 1989. ""I was entranced by the countryside, the beaches, the wildlife and the people, with their flair for color and artistry,"" he explained. He's long been using driftwood collected from the seas, beaches and rivers near his Cebu City home to create his breathtaking wildlife art, and Doran-Webb's work is a continuation of a childhood fascination with crafting wooden models and miniature sculptures. Much time in his formative years was spent in the workshops of his parent's antiques restoration firm, giving him a thorough informal education in the arts of craftsmanship. That accumulated knowledge of flair and polish is on display in his three thoroughbreds, all equine power and elegance and his biggest public art project to date. Inspired by the fact that this is the Chinese Year of the Horse, they were commissioned for New Year celebrations at the Gardens by the Bay nature park in Singapore, where they were even ""ridden"" by model jousters for a while. The logistics of creating each horse were daunting. A metal frame provides the equivalent of the animal's skeleton, with hundreds of pieces of driftwood going into each sculpture. The larger pieces are then bolted together and the bolts welded to the frame, with each smaller piece then painstakingly screwed into place. ""This wood has been dead for more than 50 years,"" Doran-Webb told CNN. ""It has weathered over those decades, and that's what makes it look so fantastic. ""I was always an outdoor type of person, and would come across these wonderful pieces of wood while out kayaking -- I have been collecting driftwood since I was 18, and have enough stockpiled to be able to find, in the end, all the right pieces. ""I'll go on a hunt for a piece for a nostril or eyebrow, but I'll come across a potential hoof instead. It's like a jigsaw puzzle: you keep on looking until you've found the right piece. ""Also, people know the sort of wood I use now and they'll bring it to me,"" added Doran-Webb, who pays them, putting money into villages where incomes can often be precarious at best. ""But sometimes I'll think I've finished a piece and then find myself starting again with a certain amount of the wood because it doesn't look right. I focus hard on the details of faces and muscles."" His first use of driftwood, though, had nothing to do with animals or sculpture -- he had initially crafted and sold furniture from it until the possibilities of creating large-scale art suddenly struck him. And what ambitious scale it is: each horse sculpture can weigh anything up to a ton (1,000 kilograms), is 16-17 hands (around 5ft 11ins) tall and can easily take the weight of a ""jockey"" or two. Each takes three to four months to create, with Doran-Webb and his team of six craftsmen working together on the process, with each sculpture springing to life from a series of initial sketches and scale models. ""I'll have an idea -- an image of a horse race or a polo match -- and sketch it until I get something that has motion and movement,"" he said. ""The metal skeleton is crucial. If you stripped away the wood, what you would see would look sort of like the skeleton of the actual animal. It provides all the strength, but cladding it takes a long time."" It may take a long time, but Doran-Webb says he's never fully satisfied with the results, and only the world of deadlines prevents him from perpetual tinkering. ""If it wasn't for them, I'd never leave the studio,"" he admitted. ""If something is even an inch out, you have to redo it. There's never been one I've been happy with first time.""","James Doran-Webb uses driftwood to create stunning sculptures .

"(CNN)Formula One star Fernando Alonso is on the road to recovery after a 150kph crash on Sunday. The Spanish driver's manager Luis Garcia Abad tweeted a picture of Alonso smiling in a hospital bed -- less than 48 hours after a hair-raising smash at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. Alonso's McLaren team confirmed in a statement Monday that the two-time world champion is making a ""solid recovery"" after undergoing a number of tests at a nearby hospital. ""From the scene of the incident he was driven to the circuit's medical center, where he was given first aid and, as per normal procedures, was sedated in preparation for an air-lift to hospital,"" read the statement. ""In hospital a thorough and complete analysis of his condition was performed, involving CT scans and MRI scans, all of which were completely normal. ""In order to provide the privacy and tranquility required to facilitate a peaceful recuperation, he is being kept in hospital for further observation, and to recover from the effects of the medication that successfully managed his routine sedation yesterday."" The incident occurred on Turn 3 of the circuit, which was hosting a testing event ahead of the start of the 2015 Formula One season next month. The crash was caused by ""the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time, and which had affected other drivers similarly,"" said McLaren. Abad's tweet showed Alonso giving a thumbs up accompanied with the words: ""Lunchtime! Thank you for your support!"" Alonso recently returned to McLaren, the team he raced for during the 2007 season, after a five year stint with Ferrari. The 2014 season saw safety in F1 come into sharp focus after Marussia driver Jules Bianchi suffered severe head injuries in Japan last October. He will be hoping to be on the grid for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, which takes places on March 15.","Fernando Alonso is recovering in hospital following a 150kph crash on Sunday .

"Imagine carrying a bowling ball between your legs that weighs close to 200 pounds. If that image is too much to stomach, continue reading with caution. Wesley Warren, 49, spent more than four years with this extra burden before having surgery to repair the damage from a rare medical condition called scrotal lymphedema. When doctors placed the swollen mass they had cut from Warren's scrotum on the scale, it weighed 132 pounds. That's not counting the fluid or smaller pieces of tissue the surgeons had also removed from the Las Vegas man. ""There are a lot of people that will look and laugh and stare in shock and awe and amazement,"" Warren says as he walks down the street in a preview for TLC's upcoming show ""The Man with the 132-Pound Scrotum."" The one-hour special airs Monday at 9 p.m. ET/PT. ""It's tough to deal with it, you know, because essentially, this is a sort of living and breathing freak show."" It began in 2008, Warren told TLC, when he awoke to a shooting pain in his testicles. The tissue around his penis soon began to swell, eventually growing at an estimated rate of 3 pounds per month. One doctor told Warren that it might be necessary to castrate him to fix the problem; others told him that he would probably die on the operating table. And the cost of the surgery alone would be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. After Warren appeared on the Howard Stern radio show, appealing for help, a fellow scrotal lymphedema sufferer referred him to Dr. Joel Gelman, who offered to do the surgery for free. Gelman, director of the Center for Reconstructive Urology at the University of California, Irvine, specializes in urethral and penile reconstruction surgery. Although the headline of TLC's special is catchy, scrotal lymphedema is a very real condition, Gelman said. He hopes media attention surrounding the show will encourage other men with the problem to seek treatment. Here are some more answers about this condition: . What is scrotal lymphedema? Scrotal lymphedema, also known as scrotal elephantiasis, is a ""massive enlargement"" of the scrotum due to thickening of tissue and accumulation of fluid, Gelman said. What causes it? Outside North America, scrotal lymphedema is often caused by a parasitic infection called lymphatic filariasis that's spread by mosquitoes. ""Thread-like worms"" lodge themselves in the lymphatic system, according to the World Health Organization, where they can interfere with a person's immune system. But lymphatic filariasis is virtually unheard-of in the United States, Gelman said. Most cases of scrotal lymphedema here are caused by blockages in the lymphatic vessels that prevent fluid from draining from the area. Doctors are unsure what causes this blockage; in Warren's case, Gelman believes it was an injury or trauma to his scrotum. What are the symptoms? The most obvious symptom is a large scrotum; this can range in size from a grapefruit to a basketball. But the mass doesn't ""max out"" at any particular size, Gelman said. It will keep growing until the patient seeks treatment. Warren's scrotum was the largest Gelman had ever seen. ""(Warren) didn't report that he was always in pain, but I think the biggest problem is that the sheer size of the mass made it very uncomfortable for him,"" the surgeon said. ""It's like lifting weights to take a step."" Warren's penis was ""buried"" about a foot under his skin, Gelman said, but fully functional. A tunnel of sorts had formed from the tip to the top layer of his swollen skin, allowing Warren to urinate without assistance. How common is scrotal lymphedema? It's rare, especially in the United States. Definite numbers are difficult to come by, and the condition may be underdiagnosed due to physicians' lack of awareness, Gelman said. Many patients with the condition are also obese and are simply instructed by their doctors to lose weight. How do you treat it? Surgery is usually the best option to remove the swollen tissue, Gelman said. A surgeon who specializes in this type of procedure will cut a T-shape in the mass, identify the penis and testicles to make sure they aren't harmed and then excise the excess tissue. The surgeon will then use undamaged tissue to cover the penis and scrotum. How is Warren doing now? Warren is walking again and enjoying life, Gelman said. He'll need a follow-up surgery to remove some additional skin that was damaged by his condition. Gelman will perform a skin graft to cover the penis and scrotum. Um, what if I think I have it? If you are experiencing the symptoms noted above, see a doctor as soon as possible. Ask for a referral to a specialist if your primary care physician is unfamiliar with these types of conditions. An unusually large scrotum can have a variety of causes, Gelman said. One of the most common is a hernia, in which a small part of the intestines enters the scrotum. Another cause is fluid buildup on one side of a man's body between the testicle and the skin; this is called hydrocele. All are treatable and usually not life-threatening unless left too long.","Wesley Warren struggled with a medical condition called scrotal lymphedema .

"For Antonio Conti, time stopped on the evening of May 29, 1985. He had taken his Juventus-supporting daughter Giusy to watch the Italian club play English team Liverpool in the 1985 European Cup final in Brussels at the Heysel Stadium. It should have been a time for celebration. Father and daughter watching the most prestigious club game in European football in the traditional climax to the season. Instead, Conti's memories of Heysel are of mayhem and death. ""It was 19:25 CET when everything happened,"" Conti told CNN. ""When I woke up half an hour later I was among dead people, and at that moment I remembered where I was. ""I looked for my daughter until I saw a shoe under a blanket and I understood that she was dead."" For the modern European football fan used to watching matches in bright, shiny all-seater stadiums, it is almost impossible to imagine attending a football game and dying there. But in the space of four years in the 1980s, nearly 200 people lost their lives in three horrific European stadium tragedies. First, on May 11 1985, just over two weeks before the Heysel stampede, came a devastating fire at the Bradford City Stadium fire on May 11, and then there was a deadly crush at another English ground -- Hillsborough -- in 1989. It is only in the last few months that Britain's political and civil institutions have begun to be held to account for the reasons behind the death of 96 people during an FA Cup match at Hillsborough, which has long cast a shadow over the city of Liverpool. Four years earlier at Heysel, Liverpool had been involved in another stadium tragedy as 39 fans -- 32 from Italy, four from Belgium, two from France, one from Northern Ireland, the youngest just 11 years old -- were killed in a stampede before the European Cup final against Juventus. ""For me that cup will always be covered in death,"" wrote Juve defender Antonio Cabrini in his autobiography ""Io Antonio."" ""The cup of death"". Forgotten story . Heysel is a story of ""incompetence, violence, cover-up, shame and lies,"" writes Professor John Foot -- the author of the authoritative history of Italian football, ""Calcio."" ""It's also a story of forgetting,"" adds Foot. ""Many people have an interest in not remembering what happened that night: the players, many fans, the Belgian politicians and police forces."" Foot's analysis is shared by Rosalina Vannini Gonnelli, who lost her husband in the tragedy and whose 18-year-old daughter was injured that night 27 years ago. ""Is there anyone who gives a damn?"" questioned Gonnelli. ""News has to be on the front page, then everyone forgets. My daughter will carry that with her for her whole life. ""I'm happy that sometimes there is someone who remembers the tragedy. ""Many, many years have passed. People had forgotten soon after it happened, so now there's no way.  The 39 angels will always be in the memories of their loved ones."" Journalist Francesco Caremani was an Italian who cared, and in 2003 he wrote a book about the tragedy -- ""The Truths of Heysel -- Chronicle of a Tragedy Foretold."" Caremani was a friend of Otello Lorentini, who was head of the now disbanded Association for the Victims of Heysel. Lorentini's son Roberto was a doctor who died at Heysel. Roberto had resuscitated a boy before being crushed to death,  an act that saw him posthumously awarded a civic medal for his bravery. ""Before my book nobody had listened to the victims. It was the first chance that they had had to speak about the night of the Heysel disaster, of the process and the battle for justice,"" said Caremani. When Roberto Lorentini died in 1985, his son Andrea, who is now a sports journalist, was just three. ""I'm angry and bitter because it's impossible to die for a football match,"" said Andrea. ""There isn't logic for what happened in Brussels."" Sector Z . There are close parallels between Hillsborough and Heysel -- disasters waiting to happen at two dilapidated stadiums, which hosted major games with poor ticketing arrangements and ""negligent policing."" Heysel Stadium's Sector Z terrace had grass poking through the crumbling concrete. Flimsy wire-netting separated the Liverpool and Juve fans while a minimal police force battled to keep control of thousands of fans. A police force whose walkie-talkies had no batteries. ""I felt a lot of anger and bitterness towards UEFA that allowed such an important match to be played in an inadequate stadium,"" said Conti. ""The curved sector where we were should not have been open to the public, because it wasn't up to hosting 15,000 people. ""In that sector there were hooligans as well and the police weren't able to keep order."" Then came the charge of the Liverpool fans. ""There are dozens of points that are usually offered to explain the context, but the context does not begin to excuse anything,"" writes Liverpool fan Tony Evans, football editor of British newspaper The Times. ""No amount of context could. That stampede might have been considered standard terrace fare, a token act of territorialism and intimidation, but it led innocent fans to flee in terror. ""Some tried to climb a wall to escape. The wall crumbled. Thirty-nine people were crushed to death. The world was appalled. Turin went into mourning. Liverpool and their supporters were left with the stigma and the stain."" With corpses lying in the stadium car park, UEFA ordered the game to go ahead for the sake of public safety. Juventus won the final 1-0 thanks to a penalty from Michel Platini, who is now president of the European governing body. ""I was at home watching the match on television, but I had the feeling that something terrible had happened to my loved ones,"" said Gonnelli. "" I spent the whole night at Pisa airport waiting for them to come back."" Platini's celebration after scoring the penalty was widely criticized, though he justified playing the game by arguing that if it had not gone ahead, it ""would have been the end of football."" Another relative told CNN that Juventus had always wanted to put a veil over Heysel to forget this page in the club's history and that the Serie A side's then president Giampiero Boniperti should have handed the European Cup back. Juventus insist that the club has never forgotten the suffering of the family victims and that the disaster's anniversary is always religiously marked. A commemorative monument was unveiled in the main courtyard of the club's headquarters shortly after the disaster, and there was a dedication to the victims at the opening of Juve's new stadium last year. ""The families of the victims are always welcome at the club, our museum and the stadium and they can come for free,"" said a Juve spokeswoman. Liverpool FC also marks the anniversary of the tragedy, with flowers placed on the memorial plaque and flags flown at half-mast, while its website features stories of remembrance. The right punishments? In the aftermath of Heysel, then UEFA president Jacques Georges and general secretary Hans Bangerter were threatened with imprisonment, before being given conditional discharges. Albert Roosens, the former secretary-general of the Belgian Football Union (BFU) and Johan Mahieu -- who was in charge of policing the stands at Heysel despite having never supervised a football match before -- were given six-month suspended prison sentences for negligence. ""Heysel is the tragedy of the century,"" said Caremani. ""UEFA and Belgian institutions are the guilty ones -- they chose that stadium and it was the worst stadium in Europe for a final of the European Cup. ""UEFA, the Belgian institutions, England and Italy try to forget about it. They don't care about the victims. It is only after Heysel that UEFA took responsibility for stadium safety."" Conti added: ""The Italian state, the Italian Football Federation and Juventus took little interest in the case."" That critique of establishment inertia might strike a chord with those relatives of the Hillsborough tragedy who have campaigned so tirelessly for the true story of their family members' deaths to be told. In the aftermath of Heysel, 25 Liverpool fans were subsequently extradited from the United Kingdom and, after a five-month trial, 14 were found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in April 1989 --  the same month of the Hillsborough disaster --  with each of them serving a year in jail . English clubs were excluded from Europe for five years, with Liverpool handed an extra year's ban. ""The anger at the hooligans of Liverpool is still very strong, unspoken, but very strong, both among the relatives of the victims -- who know the history very well -- and especially among the Juventus 'ultras'  -- who know it a little 'less well,' "" said Caremani, before adding: ""but everyone knows very well UEFA and Belgian institutions' responsibilities."" Lasting shadow . Last month the family of victims of the Hillsborough disaster received an apology from British Prime Minister David Cameron for the long delay in giving answers to all those affected by ""one of the greatest peacetime tragedies of the last century."" Cameron's apology and the publication of an independent panel's report revealing serious failings by police and emergency services was a major breakthrough for the Hillsborough campaigners after their many years of battling to get to the truth. ""I feel solidarity with the Hillsborough victims -- only those who experienced it can understand,' said Gonnelli. The truth about Hillsborough might have taken 23 years to finally seep out but in the interim, English football fans saw vast improvements to the stadia in England as a direct result of the disaster. All-seater grounds in the top leagues were enforced on the back of  recommendations made in Lord Taylor's report of 1989. No longer would fans go to a football match in fear of their lives. But was that the case in Italy? Caremani's concern is that stadium organization in Italy still remains a problem. 'Italy has not learnt the lessons in the way England did,"" he said. ""Italian hooligans are very fascinated about English hooligans. It was the model for Italy. English stadiums are really the best in the world, or most of them are. ""We have not learnt the lessons of stadium safety and organization -- the Taylor report is a totem for me. But it came after Hillsborough. Why not after Heysel?""","Nearly 200 people died in three horrific stadium tragedies in the 1980s .

"Muslim rebel leaders in the Philippines' troubled south will get access to the lion's share of the region's natural resources under a new agreement reached in peace talks with the government. The wealth-sharing deal, signed on Sunday after eight months of talks, is viewed as a key step forward in the quest for peace with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state on the resource-rich island of Mindanao. Progress in the peace process had stalled in the wake of a landmark treaty signed in October last year, which sought to put an end to a conflict that has left tens of thousands dead. ""For the benefit of Bangsamoro and the whole country, the government and the MILF once more demonstrated that they are invested in the process and will persevere in order to forge lasting peace in Mindanao, Miriam Coronel-Ferrer, the government's chief negotiator said in a statement. The October agreement laid out the groundwork for a new autonomous region called Bangsamoro that will be administered by Muslims in Mindanao. The Philippines is a predominantly Catholic country but 5% of its population is Muslim, according to the CIA World Factbook. Under the terms of the wealth-sharing deal, Muslims will get a 75% share of income derived from the exploitation of metallic minerals in the area -- reported to include gold and copper. They will also receive 75% of tax revenue, while any income derived from fossil fuels like petroleum, natural gas and coal will be split 50-50 with the central government in Manila. An end to the conflict could help bring investors to the region, which is reported to have untapped mineral deposits worth $312 billion. ""Wealth creation is important for the operation of the Bangsamoro, considering that the Bangsamoro territory is among the most underdeveloped in the Philippines due to the decades-old conflict,"" the statement added. However, hurdles remain in President Benigno Aquino's plan to achieve lasting peace in the region by 2016 when his term ends. Agreements have yet to be reached on power-sharing and normalization -- which means giving up arms.   A report published in June by the International Crisis Group warned that the peace process needed to find ways to support insurgents as they build normal, civilian lives. It estimates that the MILF has 11,000 to 12,000 fighters. ""The government has a poor track record of implementing peace agreements and the MILF is understandably wary of weakening its formidable firepower too soon,"" the report said. ""Secondly, even if it did hand over some guns, these are unlikely to be destroyed, as per international best practice; military and police would rather keep the good ones, and there is a well-documented history of leakage into the black market from government,"" it added.","Wealth-sharing deal viewed as key step forward in quest for peace with Muslim rebels .

"(CNN)What? Not enough snow, ice and cold for you? You say you STILL need some ""Frozen"" references in your life? Well, this ought to quench that need for freeze: Ice has suddenly blossomed across the Great Lakes, with the ice pack nearly doubling in just a little more than a week. The lakes are now more than 85% iced over, according to the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, with Lake Erie leading the way at more than 98%. For the first time in (not quite) forever, Niagara Falls looks pretty much frozen, too. And here's the thing ... people are going there! And not in a ""Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un is going, so we better go and smile, too"" way. These folks are going voluntarily. Niagara Falls has been doing steady business in recent days, CNN affiliate WKBW reported. ""I haven't seen it like this in a long, long time,"" one visitor, Maryann McCleary, told the station. Some tourists had come from as far away as Alabama and even from overseas, the station said. Niagara Falls isn't exactly frozen over; water is still flowing underneath the ice. It's not uncommon for parts of the falls to ice over in winter. The only recorded time the water flow stopped completely was in 1848, thanks to an ice jam upriver. Icy conditions are also par for the course in the Great Lakes. The current 85% coverage isn't a record; that would be 1979's 94.7%, according to the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. Last year's 92.5% peak was No. 2, the agency says. But there's still time for this year to contend for the record. The National Weather Service says extremely cold arctic air will allow for expansion of the ice coverage in the coming days.

"A journalist accused of striking Brad Pitt at the ""Maleficent"" premiere is out of a job and possibly faces months in jail. Ukrainian TV reporter Vitalii Sediuk is infamous for red carpet pranks around the world, including kissing Will Smith in Moscow and hugging Leonardo DiCaprio and Bradley Cooper around the knees at separate events earlier this year. Sediuk, 25, was fired from his reporter job with Ukrainian television channel 1+1 after he jumped under actress America Ferrera's dress on a Cannes red carpet on May 17, a spokesman for the company told CNN. The TV network was not involved in his stunts, a spokesman said. He was already on three years of ""formal diversion"" -- a form of probation -- in Los Angeles for crashing the Grammy stage during Adele's acceptance last year, according to the Los Angeles city attorney's spokesman.  Prosecutors are now preparing new charges for his Hollywood arrest Wednesday, spokesman Rob Wilcox said. Sediuk is set for an initial appearance before a Los Angeles judge Friday, Wilcox said. The lawyer who represented Seduik in the Grammy case was surprised when CNN called him Thursday about the latest arrest. Sediuk is ""a real nice guy,"" Anthony Willoughby said. ""I'm really shocked that he would be accused of hitting somebody."" Pitt was signing autographs at the area of the red carpet where fans are allowed to gather when Sediuk allegedly jumped the rope and hit actor in his face, according to Los Angeles Police Sgt. Leonard Calderon.  Pitt, who was there with partner Angelina Jolie, star of ""Maleficent,"" continued unfazed on the carpet to give interviews. ""This was an unfortunate and inappropriate incident that is being investigated by the LAPD,"" a spokesman for Disney Studio, the film's distributor, told CNN on Thursday. Police did not say whether Pitt was punched or slapped, just that the attacker struck him in the face. He was quickly tackled by bodyguards, handcuffed by police and hauled away to jail. Sediuk was held in the LAPD's Hollywood jail on suspicion of battery, pending $20,000 bond, according to online jail records.  Attorney Willoughby said he had not yet been called by Sediuk for help getting out of jail, but he planned to send another lawyer to the jail to check on him. ""I'm pretty sure they're going to call me,"" he said. When Sediuk is freed, he is barred from going near Pitt. Los Angeles police issued an emergency protective order effective for five days starting Thursday, but the actor's lawyer can ask a judge to extend it. The prosecutor will also ask a judge to issue a stay-away order barring Sediuk from any entertainment industry events in Los Angeles, Wilcox said. Sediuk's celebrity pranks are usually silly, attention-getting stunts that do not involve violence. Grammys stage-crasher reveals his entry plan . He eluded security to get a second-row seat inside the Staples Center at the 2013 Grammy Awards, despite having no credentials.  Sediuk jumped onto the stage when Jennifer Lopez announced Adele as the winner.  ""I love you, Adele,"" he is heard saying as the singer approached.  He was arrested offstage and later prosecuted on two misdemeanor charges. He eventually accepted a plea deal for probation with the provision that he not go back to the Staples Center and stay out of trouble for three years. ""I think that the court overly protects the entertainment industry,"" Willoughby told CNN. Award show and premiere producers apparently black-listed Sediuk after last year's Grammy incident.  He was denied reporter credentials to the Oscars, but he showed up anyway wearing a feathered swan outfit similar to the one worn by Björk on the 2001 Oscars red carpet.  He was ordered to leave the venue after telling police it was a protest. Will Smith on the red carpet slap heard 'round the world' His celebrity stunts apparently began when Sediuk handed Madonna an odd and unwelcomed gift of a hydrangea during a news conference at the Venice Film Festival in September 2011. ""I absolutely loathe hydrangeas,"" she said as she stuffed them under a table. Don't buy Madonna hydrangeas . Sediuk's infamy grew in May 2012 on a Moscow red carpet where Will Smith was attending a movie premiere. Video shows Sediuk attempting to kiss the actor on the mouth.  ""Come on, what the hell is your problem?"" Smith said as he pushed the reporter away and lightly slapped him.  ""He's lucky I ain't sucker punched him."" Sediuk crawled onto a red carpet and under Ferraro's dress at the Cannes Film Festival in France earlier this month. Video shows him being dragged away.  It was this incident that cost him his job at the Ukrainian channel, the company said. Sediuk's actions ""were neither suggested nor coordinated by the network,"" 1+1 TV spokesman Serhiy Popov told CNN on Thursday.  ""Vitalii was acting on his own behalf and not on the behalf of the channel."" The network is not helping Sediuk deal with his legal problems, Popov said.","Brad Pitt gets protective order against alleged attacker .

"(CNN)Universally acknowledged as one of the finest racehorses to ever jump a fence, Sprinter Sacre drew the crowds for his comeback at a wintry Ascot, Saturday. The nine-year-old, renowned for his attacking style of spectacular jumping, was back after spending 13 months on the sidelines with a heart murmur. On his toes before the race and with a silky sheen of sweat on his skin, this enthusiastic chaser looked in excellent physical condition and seemed eager to do his job on his belated return. But his gusto might have proved his undoing given his distinct lack of big race running. The nine-year-old was scratchy early in the race and his jumping scruffy, but he traveled powerfully into the straight under jockey Barry Geraghty. Sprinter Sacre looked the winner approaching the second last obstacle before being shot down by the overwhelming run of Dodging Bullets. ""There was no messing about. They went a good gallop and it just found him out in the end,"" trainer Nicky Henderson told the media at Ascot. ""I loved the way he traveled. Only one day matters and he'll come on plenty for this."" The day in question is the Queen Mother Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival in March, the best two mile steeplechase in the British horse racing calendar and a race which Sprinter Sacre won by 19 astonishing lengths in 2013. That performance was described by respected ratings organization Timeform as ""the finest performance of the modern era."" Yet as Ascot was cloaked in dusk and the crowd began to wend their way home while the bookmakers balanced their books, news broke of Sprinter Sacre bleeding from the nose after the race. While Henderson said that this issue could not have affected his comeback performance, questions began to form about further implications for his Festival participation. Despite reasons for hope after his comeback, a heart murmur is not a problem that will immediately wisp away but rather one that will still require vigilance. After optimism in defeat, the coming days will prove whether doubt will more sternly shroud one of the greatest horses we are ever likely to see.","Star jumper Sprinter Sacre makes comeback after 13 months on the sidelines .

"James Murdoch insisted Tuesday that he knew little about the scale of phone hacking by people working for the News of the World, as he continued his fight to limit the damage the scandal does to him and his family's media empire. Underlings did not tell him how pervasive it was when he took over News Corp.'s British newspaper publishing arm, he said. He agreed with a suggestion that the reason was because they knew he would put a stop to it. ""I think that must be it, that I would say, 'Cut out the cancer,' and there was some desire to not do that,"" he told the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics. Former Murdoch employees testified earlier that they told him about the problem. He was testifying before an independent British inquiry into journalistic ethics prompted by phone hacking at the defunct News of the World, once the flagship British Sunday tabloid of News Corp. The scandal has reverberated through the British political establishment, led to dozens of arrests on suspicion of criminal activity and forced News Corp. to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking. Tuesday's hearing revealed the depth of the links between the Murdoch family and British politicians, with Murdoch saying he had had drinks with David Cameron at a pub before Cameron became prime minister and dined with him once he was in office. Leveson Inquiry lawyer Robert Jay pressed Murdoch over the extent of his contact with politicians as the company moved to take full control of satellite broadcaster BSkyB, a bid that collapsed because of the phone-hacking scandal. Evidence published Tuesday suggests that News Corp. was getting inside information from the government minister with the power to approve or block the acquisition, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Hundreds of pages of e-mails painted a picture of a back channel between Hunt's office and Frederic Michel, a top Murdoch employee. Michel told Murdoch in January 2011 that he had gotten ""absolutely illegal"" information about government plans related to the takeover plan, the e-mails show. Prime Minister Cameron has full confidence in Hunt, his spokesman Craig Oliver told CNN after the Murdoch testimony concluded. Hunt's portfolio includes the London Olympics, which are now less than 100 days away. James Murdoch and his father, Rupert Murdoch, have been hammered over the past year about what they knew about phone hacking by people working for them. Rupert Murdoch is scheduled to appear Wednesday and perhaps Thursday morning at the inquiry. The younger Murdoch has already been called twice to testify before British lawmakers and resigned from a number of top management positions at British subsidiaries of his father's media empire. He and his father have always denied knowing about the scale of phone hacking, which police say could have affected thousands of people, ranging from celebrities and politicians to crime victims and war veterans. James Murdoch said Tuesday that he had no reason to look into illegal eavesdropping by his employees when he took over the company's British newspaper subsidiary in December 2007. A News of the World reporter and a private investigator had been sent to prison that year for hacking the phones of the staff of Princes William and Harry, but Murdoch said he had been assured that the problem went no further. ""I was not told sufficient information to go and turn over a whole bunch of stones that I was told had already been turned over,"" he said. ""I don't think that, short of knowing they weren't giving me the full picture, I would've been able to know that at the time."" The journalist who went to prison, Clive Goodman, had been saying that phone-hacking went beyond his case, Leveson Inquiry counsel Robert Jay said. ""I was not aware of that,"" Murdoch replied. He told the Leveson Inquiry on Tuesday that he did not decide what went into the company's British tabloids, The Sun and the News of the World, relying on his editors to make the decisions. He was also pressed on his relationship with British politicians, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair and the current leader, Cameron. He acknowledged meeting with them, but denied having lobbied them improperly about his family's business interests. And he denied having made a ""crass calculation"" about how The Sun's endorsement of Cameron's Conservative party before the 2010 elections would affect News Corp. Dozens of people have been arrested in criminal investigations into phone and e-mail hacking and police bribery, and police asked prosecutors last week to charge at least eight people. The suspects include at least one journalist and a police officer, the Crown Prosecution Service said, declining to name them. No charges have been filed, and the Crown Prosecution Service said it did not know when a decision would be made about charges. The British government set up the Leveson Inquiry, the independent investigation that summoned the Murdochs, in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. Two parliamentary committees also are looking into media conduct. James Murdoch, 39, resigned as chairman of British Sky Broadcasting this month, saying, ""I am determined that the interests of BSkyB should not be undermined by matters outside the scope of this company."" Rupert Murdoch testified before lawmakers in July alongside his son. News Corp. shut down its British Sunday tabloid, The News of the World, last summer after public outrage at the scale of illegal eavesdropping its journalists did in search of stories. The British lawyer representing dozens of alleged News Corp. phone-hacking victims was in New York last week, exploring options for a U.S. case against the company. Attorney Mark Lewis said he is representing three or four new clients, one of whom is believed to be a U.S. citizen, who say their phones were hacked while they were on U.S. soil. There are also many other potential new clients, Lewis said. ""As I've been traveling here,"" he said, ""I've been contacted by many people who've had, so they say, similar problems -- not just hacking but maybe being trailed or have fallen out with some American Murdoch News Corp. company and then found themselves, as they would say, at the wrong end of investigations, the wrong end of information gathered.""","Evidence reveals a back channel between News Corp. and the government .

"Brussels (CNN)First France, now Belgium and possibly Greece. Where next? The recent spate of terror attacks and threats in Europe has many wondering what the next target might be and how the danger can be mitigated. Here are the latest developments: . Five Belgian nationals have been charged with participation in a terrorist organization after police raided a suspect terror cell in Verviers, the country's federal prosecutor said. Three are in custody, and two have been released ""under strict conditions,"" Erik Van Der Sypt said. And two additional suspects are in French custody after they were detained while trying to cross from France into Italy through the Frejus Tunnel, the prosecutor said. The suspected terror cell in Verviers, which included people returning from Syria, planned to target police officers, Van Der Sypt said. Police said they recovered weapons, bomb-making materials and police uniforms. Two suspects were killed in the police raid Thursday, and a third was injured and taken into custody. Authorities have not released their identities. Heavily armed guards filtered through the streets of Brussels and Antwerp on Saturday, a sight the country hasn't seen in 35 years. Why is Belgium particularly vulnerable? The small country is believed to have more suspected jihadists per capita than any other country in Western Europe. Greek authorities say they are cooperating with Belgian authorities on an investigation, and on Sunday Belgium requested the extradition of one of the suspects arrested in Greece. Greek police confirmed that there have been some arrests and are looking for other individuals, but said that none so far were linked to the Belgian plot. Belgian federal prosecutor Van Der Sypt, however, said the Belgian investigation ""gave us enough reason to ask for the extradition of one of the persons that were arrested yesterday by the Greek authorities."" The investigation revealed that one of the people arrested in Greece could be involved in the plot that was stopped in Belgium, Van Der Sypt said. European counterterrorism agencies are scrambling to assess the potential terrorism threat from people with suspected links to Islamic extremists. As many as 20 sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people could be ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, a Western intelligence source told CNN. European Union and Middle East intelligence agencies identified an ""imminent threat"" to Belgium and possibly to the Netherlands, the source told CNN. ""There is a tremendous amount of concern over sleeper cells in Europe,"" said a Western official with direct knowledge of the situation. But while there is a ""realistic threat"" to the Netherlands, government spokesman Edmond Messchaert said there is ""no concrete or specific information of an attack in the Netherlands."" Two additional people whose DNA was found on the belongings of jihadist Amedy Coulibaly are being sought by authorities, according to a source in Paris with knowledge of the investigation into this month's attacks in the French capital. The DNA of one was found on a charger belonging to Coulibaly, the source told CNN. Coulibaly is accused of killing four people in a siege at a kosher market and gunning down a police officer. Meanwhile, three women detained in connection with the Paris terror attacks were released from custody Sunday, the public prosecutor's office told CNN. Nine other people will remain in custody for at least 48 hours while the investigation continues. The detainees were held after a series of terror attacks this month that left 17 people dead -- including 12 people in an attack at the offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate, claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo shooting. The publisher of Charlie Hebdo says the newspaper will increase the press run of the latest issue, which features a depiction of the Prophet Mohammed, to 7 million. ISIS, the extremist Islamist group that controls swaths of Iraq and Syria, runs large training facilities in Syria and has access to thousands of potential European recruits. Officials are monitoring groups of men who have returned to Europe from fighting in Syria. It is believed ISIS directed operatives to return to Europe to launch attacks in retaliation for airstrikes against the terror group in Syria and Iraq, according to the official. Several European nations, including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, are participating in the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq. CNN's Ivan Watson reported from Brussels; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta; and Tim Lister reported from Paris. CNN's  Margot Haddad  contributed to this report.","Neither Belgium nor Greece confirms whether the probe involves a jihadi cell in Verviers .

"Earlier this year, a European court ruled that search engine operators such as Google could be held responsible for personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties and found through their searches. As thousands of people ask for their information to be removed, is Google is trying its best to provide a workable solution or trying to undermine a ruling that, from the very start, it really did not like? In the commentary I wrote for CNN the day after the ruling in the Google Spain case, I suggested the result created a headache -- and potentially huge costs -- for Google, and that it could open the door to a flood of cases, each of which would need a resolution. I wrote that how Google responded to the ruling would be critical -- and the initial signs are that the company's response has already caused problems. As predicted, Google received a huge volume of requests to have links removed -- more than 40,000 in the first four days after the ruling. The company has now begun the process of responding to them. If the request appears valid -- and how that is determined is one key issue -- there seem to be three parts to their response: . First is the removal of the search result -- and it must be remembered that it is only search results when a particular name is searched for that are removed, not the source material nor search results for that material when searched for in any other way. Second is that search results for individuals using European versions of Google (that is, google.co.uk rather than google.com) will now often include a message at the bottom that reads: ""Some results may have been removed under data protection law in Europe."" The curious are then offered the chance to ""learn more"" on the company's privacy and terms page. This alert does not, however, mean that search results have been removed -- it appears if any search is made for an individual's name where there are no ""public figures"" with that same name. Thirdly comes the part of the response which has triggered the most dramatic results: If a link to an article is blocked as a result of a request, notification is sent to the publisher of that article. When journalists receive that notification they are, quite naturally, upset. Two particular examples involving prominent journalists in the UK have highlighted this -- and both have written about it. The first was James Ball in the Guardian, the second Robert Peston for the BBC. Both wrote pieces about the experience; Peston's had an understandably dramatic headline: ""Why has Google cast me into oblivion?"" In both Ball's and Peston's cases, many of the stories that they had been notified about did not seem to fall into categories covered by the Google Spain ruling: old, irrelevant stories about people who were not public figures. Ball's stories included pieces from 2010 and 2011 -- scarcely old -- while Peston's covered critical events in the banking world in 2007 -- the ousting of banker Stan O'Neal from Merrill Lynch -- something that cannot be described as irrelevant or not in the public interest. It looked as though this was exactly what the opponents of the right to be forgotten were worried about: censorship and the rewriting of history. Peston, however, was not quite convinced, hence his headline that Google was casting him into oblivion, not the European Court of Justice. Was it, in fact, that Google were overreacting -- either that they were, as Peston put it, ""clumsy"" or that, perhaps, they were deliberately attempting to undermine the ruling by making it seem either unworkable or a dangerous form of censorship. That Google might be deliberately undermining the ruling seems possible; all three parts of their response could contribute to this view. Firstly, they seem to be erring on the side of the people wishing for things to be blocked -- and hence they do create more censorship. Secondly, by alerting about far more search results than are actually affected by the rulings, they create an atmosphere in which people feel more censored. Thirdly, by the form which their notification to journalists takes, they make journalists feel censored -- and might make strong, important and expert journalists into allies in their attempts to undermine the ruling. The combination of these three is a potent one. On the other hand, it is possible that it is simply clumsy, and that these are teething troubles. Peston says: ""Google insists it is simply complying with the relevant articles in the European Court of Justice's ruling."" In a message to those seeking to have content removed, Google itself acknowledges it is still ""working to finalize our implementation of removal requests."" The individual cases that have made the headlines have begun to unravel a little: Google has reversed its decisions on James Ball's pieces, recognising there is a public interest. Peston's piece is more interesting. The assumption Peston made, reasonably enough, was that the link would be blocked when people search for Sean O'Neal, since his was the only name that appeared in the article in question. But in fact, it turns out that the request to block the story related to a member of the public whose name appeared in the comments on the piece -- the link removed relates to searches for that person. Searching for Sean O'Neal still brings up the article. Google's response is in line with the law -- but it looks far worse than it is. That, indeed, may be true of the whole story surrounding the right to be forgotten. It looks worse than it is. I hope that is the case, and that these events are just teething troubles, and that better, more workable solutions will appear, and a more appropriate balance between privacy and freedom of expression can be struck. How Google's response develops in the weeks and months to come is the key -- and whether they really want to find a way to make it work will determine that. This whole affair demonstrates the huge power that Google already wields. Because, ultimately, it is Google carrying out this ""censorship,"" not the court. Google does similar things already, though without such a fanfare, in relation to copyright protection, links to things like obscene or illegal content and so forth.  They are already acting as censors -- and as they tailor search results to the individual anyway, they are already choosing what people see and read -- and what they don't see and read. The most important thing that Google can do in response to the court ruling is to engage positively and actively with the ongoing reform process of the Data Protection Regime. A well-executed reform, with a better written, more limited and more appropriate version of the right to be forgotten could be the ultimate solution here. If that can be brought in soon -- rather than delayed or undermined -- then we can all move on from the Google Spain ruling, both legally and practically. Everyone might benefit from that.","Thousands of people request removal of information about them from Google searches .

"(CNN) -- Get ready to hear that voice, hear that sound -- like thunder gonna shake the ground. Confirming rumors that had been around at least since last month, the NFL said Sunday that Katy Perry will headline the next Super Bowl halftime show. Following in the show-stopping dance steps of Bruno Mars from this year might be a tall order. But Perry says she's already planning her own fireworks. ""I've got some insane ideas this year,"" she said in a video posted soon after the announcement. ""What if we covered the stadium with glitter? ""But the glitter ... was edible."" Last month, New York Post's Page Six and Billboard reported that Perry was preparing to shine at Super Bowl XLIX, set for February 1 in Glendale, Arizona. It's not hard to see why the NFL would want to pursue Perry. Here are three reasons why we think she'll kill it. 1. She's got energetic, exuberant pop . Katy Perry's music is essentially the stuff Super Bowl halftime dreams are made of. Much of her catalog is high-energy, danceable pop that's just cheeky enough to be entertaining without losing a sponsorship. And she has a backlog of hits to choose from: There's ""Birthday"" and ""Roar"" from her 2013 release ""Prism,"" plus older but still-in-rotation tracks like ""Firework,"" ""Peacock,"" ""California Gurls"" and ""I Kissed A Girl."" 2. Everyone from your grandma to your 3-year-old nephew knows her music . In 2011, Katy Perry tied with Michael Jackson -- not bad company -- with five No. 1 singles from the same album. You don't accomplish that without some serious fan power, young and old. And when we say young, we mean young: ""Dark Horse"" has been known to soothe at least one baby. 3. She gives a show-stopping performance . One of the things critics took away from Perry's 2012 concert documentary, ""Part of Me,"" is just how much work goes into a Perry performance. From the costumes to the set pieces, Perry creates her own whimsical wonderland -- as anyone who's seen one of her videos can attest. We can only imagine the kind of creation that would accompany a Super Bowl halftime show.

"Anti-riot police patrolled the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka and elsewhere in the country Tuesday as angry protesters took to the streets, damaging motor vehicles and burned used tires in a general strike, police and witnesses said. Protesters from the country's largest Islamic party, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, clashed with police in Dhaka and other major cities, blocking roads and highways. The strike, taking effect all over the country, paralyzed daily life as road communications were heavily disrupted and schools and business establishments remained closed. The pickets also damaged a U.S. embassy vehicle in the Khilkhet area in Dhaka, leaving its driver and a police officer injured. ""No diplomatic staff was inside the vehicle, which was going to the airport,"" Khilkhet police station chief Shamim Hossain told journalists. Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami on its website claimed responsibility of the attack, but said it was ""unexpected and unfortunate."" The U.S. embassy in Dhaka in a media statement condemned the attack and said, ""The ability to engage in peaceful protest is a fundamental democratic right; there is no justification for the resort to violence."" ""We call upon the perpetrators to be held accountable for this unprovoked attack on a diplomatic vehicle and its innocent occupants,"" the statement said. In many areas, pickets clashed with police, who used teargas shells to disperse angry mobs. Jamaat-e-Islami called a strike on Tuesday to protest the arrest and trial of its top leaders, who face charges of war crimes during the country's war of independence in 1971.

"We're guessing this is going to end up on a lot of ""world's most dangerous ski runs"" lists. But probably for a different reason than any of the other entries. North Korea is building a ""world class"" ski resort on Masik hill in Wonsan with a range of ski runs and a hotel, according to the North Korean state news agency. Located in Kangwon Province, Masik hill is 2,520 feet (768 meters) high and typically receives heavy snowfall from early November through early March. Construction underway . A series of photos of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaking with his staff in front of the ski resort site was released this week. The accompanying news report from the state-run Korean Central News Agency said the young leader dropped by to get a firsthand report on the progress of construction. ""He was greatly satisfied to learn that soldier-builders have constructed a skiing area on mountain ranges covering hundreds of thousands of square meters, including primary, intermediate and advanced courses with almost 110,000 meters (68.3 miles) in total length and 40-120 meters (131-394 feet) in width,"" said the KCNA report. 7 best ski and snowboard resorts in South Korea . The new resort will be accessible from the Pyongyang-Wonsan tourist motorway and will feature a hotel, heliport and ""cableway."" Kim, who was partly educated in Switzerland, appears to be familiar with ski resort operations. ""He said it is necessary to build not only rest places, but first aid stations at starting, middle and final points of the courses, and establish an automatic cableway monitoring system for a real time watch so as to take measures to prevent accidents,"" said the report. According to the report, Kim also emphasized environmental conservation: ""He underlined the need to preserve the ecological environment and prevent pollution while building the skiing ground."" Behind the veil: A rare look at life in North Korea . Would you go? According to a tour agency specializing in North Korean travel, the new resort will be open to foreign tourists. ""We've known of the plans for this development for a couple of years -- work only began recently though and I've seen the basic plans just last week,"" said Simon Cockerell, general manager of Beijing-based Koryo Tours. Cockerell returned last week from the first Western tour of the North Korean border town of Sinuiju. No opening date has been given for the opening of the resort. South Korean media covered the news of the resort in critical fashion. ""The fact that North Korea is spending exorbitant amounts of money building a ski resort while its people and even its military don't have enough to eat shows that this is just a move to advertise the image of Kim Jong Un as a leader who cares about his people,"" an anonymous North Korean defector told NK News, a South Korea-based media company specializing in North Korean news. The defector also said that existing ski infrastructure in North Korea is used exclusively for military purposes, and that there's a high likelihood this will also be the case with the new resort.

"(CNN)American skier Lindsey Vonn clinched World Cup victory number 62 Sunday, equaling the all-time record which has stood for 35 years . In foggy conditions and on soft snow in the women's downhill at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, Vonn recorded a time of 1 minute 39.61 seconds, beating Austria's Elisabeth Goergl by 0.32 seconds. The victory tied Vonn with Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proell's, who set the benchmark between 1970 and 1980. ""I was a little bit nervous in the start"", the 30-year-old said in an interview with the International Ski Federation website. ""I thought I skied really well on Friday, but it was tough conditions and I wasn't able to be on top of the podium. Today was kind of the same, the snow was soft but at least it was sunny. I just tried to keep my feet underneath me and not to push the skis against the snow too much and it worked out."" The victory marks an incredible comeback for Vonn, who had been out with a serious knee injury for 18 months. In a desperate attempt to get fit for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, Vonn aggravated her knee and needed a second operation. Much of the talk since her comeback has concerned the World Cup record, which has proved something of a distraction. ""Every time I'm in the starting gate I'm trying to win, whether it's 60, 61, 62 or whatever it is, I just try to ski my best,"" she said. ""So it was more frustrating just talking about this record in the media. But for me, mentally, it was the same as any other race. Now I'm happy we can stop talking about it."" Although few will actually stop talking about it. Vonn now has the chance to hold the record outright, with 63 wins, in Monday's super-G. ""I've surprised myself how far I come,"" Vonn told CNN after her victory. ""I'm really excited for another race tomorrow. Hopefully I can break the record tomorrow. I love what I do. I want to win as many races as possible. I have a lot more to give the sport."" The was one last question to ask: had she spoken to her boyfriend, Tiger Woods? ""Yeah I talked to him and he said he's really proud of me,"" she confirmed. ""He was watching with his daughter early in the morning. I was sad he wasn't here but he's training.

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)A suicide blast targeting a bus station in northeast Nigeria on Sunday killed at least four people and injured 48 others. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but previous bombings in the region have been blamed on Boko Haram Islamists by authorities. The attack happened in the town of Potiskum, police and hospital sources said. ""We have received four dead bodies and 48 people with several degrees of injuries from the bus station attacked by a suicide bomber,"" a paramedic at the Potiskum General Hospital said. The explosion rocked the Tashar Kunne open-air bus station on the outskirts of the town Sunday morning when the young suicide bomber ‎rammed his car into parked buses waiting to fill up with passengers, witnesses said. ""The bom‎ber looked around 13 and he drove his car into buses waiting for passengers, resulting in an explosion that shook the whole area,"" said grocer Hamza Ibrahim, who witnessed the blast. The suicide attack caused a stampede in the Potiskum main market which is held on Sunday, with traders and shoppers hurriedly evacuating the market, residents said. The ‎attack happened a week after two female suicide bombers attacked a mobile phone market in the town, killing four and injuring 46, according to hospital sources. Potiskum, the commercial capital of Yobe state, has been repeatedly rocked by deadly Boko Haram bomb and gun attacks during the group's armed attempt to establish a strict Islamic state in northern Nigeria.","A witness says the bomber appeared to be about 13 .

"(CNN)Protesters gathered at Kiev's Independence Square Sunday to march for peace, while fighting in Ukraine's east claimed more victims. Ukraine's President and prime minister were among those who attended the rally that had as its slogan ""I am Volnovakha,"" in memory of the 13 passengers who died near the city of Volnovakha after their bus was hit by artillery shelling on January 13. ""We will remember every Ukrainian hero who gave (life) for the sake of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" said Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. ""We will not give up a single meter of our land."" Meanwhile, fighting in the east continued. Government forces and pro-Russia rebels have been battling for control of eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions since April, after Russia annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region the previous month. The Ukrainian army was able to regain full control of the Donetsk airport, military spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko said Sunday. Over the last 24 hours, four Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 32 were wounded, the spokesman said. A 7-year-old boy and a 16-year-old were killed when a missile struck a house in the town of Vuhlehirsk, in Donetsk, said Donetsk's regional police chief Vyacheslav Abroskin on his Facebook page. A young girl was seriously injured. A ceasefire deal was reached on September 5 in Minsk, Belarus, following talks between representatives of Ukraine, Russia and rebel leaders. A subsequent agreement on September 19 set out more measures, but there has been little sign of progress as all sides blame each other for the bloodshed. The United Nations issued a statement Sunday, calling on all parties to exercise restraint. ""The Secretary-General is alarmed by the severe escalation of fighting for control of Donetsk airport in eastern Ukraine, which has already caused numerous casualties and threatened to completely unravel a hard-won September 2014 cease-fire,"" it read. The statement continued: The Secretary-General stresses that further deterioration of a situation that has led to heavy loss of life and civilian suffering must be avoided at all costs.

"Out of the political frying pan and into the partisan fire for Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. A day after apologizing and taking responsibility for the problem-plagued Obamacare website, Sebelius got subpoenaed on Thursday by one of the fiercest Republican critics of the administration -- House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa of California. Issa told CNN that the subpoena demands documents and information relating to the HealthCare.gov website that his committee previously requested from Sebelius, adding she ""answered some questions but evaded a great many."" ""Now we really need to insist on those documents,"" he said. A spokeswoman for the Health and Human Services Department noted last week that Issa's committee began requesting a broad range of documents and transcribed interviews during the recent 16-day government shutdown. ""While we are working diligently to satisfy their interest and have repeatedly communicated our intent to cooperate, their timeline was not feasible given the vast scope of their requests,"" the spokeswoman, Joanne Peters, said Thursday. ""We are disappointed that the committee believes a subpoena was necessary; however it does not change our intent to continue to cooperate with them to produce documents as expeditiously as we are able to,"" she added. Meanwhile, some top Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters Thursday to Sebelius and four contractors involved in the website project requesting documents involving security concerns raised at its hearing a day earlier with the Secretary. It's been almost a month since the website for enrolling in President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms went live. But technical problems, despite a series of advance warning signs, have impeded the system and provoked anger and frustration. Even after a chorus of apologies out of Washington, it may be another month before everything's running smoothly. The federal agency that oversees the troubled website announced Thursday it had brought on experts from tech giants Google, Oracle and Red Hat to the team working to fix the problems. According to a blog post by Julie Bataille, spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, dozens of people were reinforcing the ""tech surge"" by the administration working on the website issues. ""They come from leading technology companies such as Red Hat and Oracle, and include individuals with expertise on site reliability; stability; and scalability,"" Bataille's webpost said. She identified one of the new additions as Michael Dickerson, a site reliability engineer on leave from Google. On Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden became the highest-ranking administration official to apologize for the botched rollout. ""We assumed that it was up and ready to run,"" he told CNN's sister network HLN. ""But the good news is although it's not -- and we apologize for that -- we are confident by the end of November it will be, and there'll still be plenty of time for people to register and get online."" That mea culpa came after Sebelius apologized for the ""miserably frustrating"" problems during a 3 1/2-hour congressional grilling. She said she made a mistake when she told Obama that HealthCare.gov was ""ready to go"" for its October 1 launch. Sebelius promised a ""vast majority"" of consumers will have an easier time shopping online for health insurance under Obamacare by the end of November. Analysis: Sebelius deals with a difficult day . ""In these early weeks, access to HealthCare.gov has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many Americans, including many who have waited years, in some cases their entire lives, for the security of health insurance,"" Sebelius said. She echoed the overall administration stance -- that a team of experts is scrambling to fix the website's errors. To the frustrated users who have had problems, she said: ""You deserve better. I apologize. I'm accountable to you for fixing these problems."" 5 things we learned from Sebelius hearing . Obama tried to log on . Biden said he didn't even bother logging on to the Obamacare site. ""Actually, the President tried to get online, and my daughter tried to get online,"" he said. ""I did not, because it was clear that I was not getting online."" Obama himself acknowledged that too many people ""have gotten stuck, and I am not happy about it."" ""There's no excuse for it,"" the President said. ""And I take full responsibility for making sure it gets fixed ASAP."" Glass half full? Sebelius said the sweeping health care program has delivered on its promise to provide affordable health care coverage. Thousands have been able to access the website to look at new health coverage options that will give them security of knowing they won't go bankrupt if they get sick, she said. Who is Kathleen Sebelius? Republicans have called for Sebelius to be fired for the Obamacare problems, but a White House spokesman said Wednesday that Obama has ""complete confidence"" in her. ""She took responsibility for many of the problems that are evident with the (Obamacare) website, but she also deserves credit for the other aspects of the Affordable Care Act implementation that have gone well,"" spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. In fact, Obama tried to turn the tables on Republican opponents of his signature health care reforms, challenging them to come up with helpful ideas instead of undermining the federal law. ""Anyone defending the remnants of the old, broken system -- as if it was working for people -- anybody who thinks we shouldn't finish the job of making the health care system work for everybody ... those folks should have to explain themselves,"" he said. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation website, 15.4 million people had individual health care coverage in 2011, representing about 5% of the population. The vast majority of Americans have coverage through their employer, Medicare, Medicaid or other public providers. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday that ""a significant portion"" of the 5% of people with individual coverage will end up paying less for better policies when they shop around in the new exchanges. Early warning signs . Some of the criticism surrounding the website's launch has to do with what Obama and other officials knew -- and when they knew it. CNN has learned the administration received stark warnings a month before the launch that the Obamacare site was not ready to go live, according to a confidential report. The caution, from the main contractor CGI Federal, warned of risks and issues for HealthCare.gov, even as company executives were testifying publicly the project was on track. Administration was warned before site launch . Sebelius told the House committee the outside contractors who built the website never recommended delaying this month's launch. But she conceded that ""we did not adequately do end-to-end testing."" The contracts with the private companies working on the Obamacare website -- which amount to $174 million so far, with more bills due well into 2014 -- do not have ""built-in penalties"" allowing her department to charge them for disappointing or faulty work, Sebelius said. But Sebelius said the agency will not pay for incomplete work. Security questions . Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, accused Sebelius of putting the private information of Americans at risk by failing to properly test security measures on the website. ""This is a completely unacceptable level of security,"" he said. ""You know it's not secure."" Sebelius responded that testing occurs regularly, and she told Rogers she would get back to him on whether any end-to-end security test of the entire system has ever occurred. Rogers said he knows there have been no such comprehensive security tests. Memo warned of high security risk at health care website . An internal government memo obtained by CNN on Wednesday that was written days before the website launched warned of a ""high"" security risk because of a lack of testing. ""Due to system readiness issues, the (security control assessment) was only partly completed,"" said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services memo. ""This constitutes a risk that must be accepted and mitigated to support the Marketplace Day 1 operations."" Sebelius told CNN last week that Obama didn't know of the problems with the site -- even though insurance companies had complained and the site crashed during a pre-launch test run -- until after it went live. A senior administration official said Obama now gets a ""nightly readout"" with the latest Obamacare statistics and an update of the website's status.

"Iran has named a member of the radical student group that seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held Americans hostage for more than a year to be its next ambassador to the United Nations. Hamid Aboutalebi, was a member of the Muslim Students Following the Imam's Line, the group of militants who seized the U.S. embassy on November 4, 1979, holding 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. A U.S. official said the State Department has not yet responded to Aboutalebi's visa application to represent Iran at the United Nations. Aboutalebi is a veteran diplomat who has served as Iran's ambassador to Australia, Belgium, Italy, and the European Union. He has also held high-profile posts in the Iranian Foreign Ministry. He currently works in the political affairs office of President Hassan Rouhani and is believed to be close to the Iranian leader, who is widely viewed as a moderate with a reformist agenda. But the choice of Aboutalebi could complicate President Barack Obama's efforts to re-engage with Tehran after the election of Rouhani and negotiate a comprehensive agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program with five other world powers. With no formal relations between the United States and Iran, the Iranian mission to the United Nations is Tehran's only diplomatic operation in the United States and has played a role in facilitating unofficial exchanges of messages between the two nations. In an interview with Iranian media, Aboutalebi said he served as translator and negotiator, but denied taking part in the initial occupation of the embassy. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf declined to comment if the United States was aware that Aboutalebi was a member of the group which seized the embassy. She said the United States has a process to review all visa applications, but the applications themselves remained confidential. ""Anyone can submit a visa application, and it will be evaluated as we do all visa applications, in accordance with our procedures,"" she said. ""We don't speculate on what the outcome might be."" But the controversy, first reported this weekend by Bloomberg, could spark demands from Congress to deny Aboutalebi's visa. That would be an unusual step given the United States is obligated to grant entry visas to representatives of U.N. member-states  in accordance with a 1947 agreement signed with the world body. Last year, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir decided not to attend the U.N. General Assembly when the State Department failed to respond to his visa application. The International Criminal Court has issued warrants for Bashir's arrest and referral for trial in the Hague for crimes against humanity. Although the United States is not a party to the court, the ICC has asked the United States to surrender him if he enters American territory. Even if the United State granted Aboutalebi a visa, he would not be free to move about the United States. As a representative of a country listed as a State Sponsor of Terrorism by the State Department, Aboutalebi would be confined to a radius of 25 miles from Manhattan, just as diplomats from North Korea and Syria are. Still, former American hostage Barry Rosen said it would be a ""disgrace"" if Washington gave a visa to Aboutalebi and called on the Obama administration to deny his application. ""It may be a precedent but if the President and the Congress don't condemn this act by the Islamic Republic, then our captivity and suffering for 444 days at the hands of Iran was for nothing,"" he said in a statement. ""He can never set foot on American soil.""","Member of group who seized American hostages in 1979 now a diplomat .

"Six people who were arrested in Iran for dancing in a YouTube video to Pharrell Williams' song ""Happy"" have been freed, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said Wednesday, citing a source close to the families. The director of the video was not released, the group said. One of the six announced that she was freed. ""Hi I'm back,"" Reihane Taravati wrote on her Instagram account, thanking Williams and ""everyone who cared about us."" The fan video is one of many to the hit song that has sold millions of downloads worldwide. Tehran Police Chief Hossein Sajedinia ordered the arrests of the three men and three women for helping make an ""obscene video clip that offended the public morals and was released in cyberspace,"" the Iranian Students' News Agency reported Wednesday.  Authorities forced the young people to repent on state TV. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani seemed to think differently.  ""#Happiness is our people's right. We shouldn't be too hard on behaviors caused by joy,"" a tweet on his account said.  It seemed to be quoting one of his comments from June 2013. Pharrell Williams denounced the arrests. ""It is beyond sad that these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness,"" the Grammy Award winner said on his Facebook page. Just like in the singer's original video, the Iranian fan version features a montage of men and women dancing to the song in a variety of settings. Taravati gushed over the reaction to the video in the days before the Tuesday arrests. ""178K VIEWS thank you,"" she wrote on her Facebook page last week.  She also posted a picture of people featured in the video on Instagram. ""People of Tehran are happy! Watch and Share Our Happiness!,"" Taravati wrote. ""Let the world hear us! we are happy and we deserve to be!"" Arrests come amid support for photo project . The arrests come amid growing support on Facebook for an unrelated project featuring photographs submitted by women who appear without Iran's legally required head scarves.

""This is the voice of Iranian women who have been censored all their lives in Iran,"" London-based journalist Masih Alinejad, who created the page, told HLN, CNN's sister network. ""And now social media is giving them the opportunity to speak out, to be themselves."" Conversely, Iranian officials and some journalists denounced an Iranian actress who extended her hand in greeting to a film festival executive and received a kiss on the cheek from him, according to media reports. The BBC reported that a conservative journalism organization run by Iran's state broadcaster said actress Leila Hatami engaged in ""unconventional and improper"" behavior by extending her hand to Cannes Film Festival president Gilles Jacob. For his part, Jacob dismissed the controversy over kissing Hatami on the cheek. He said on Twitter that she represented ""all Iranian cinema"" and called the uproar over the kiss needless controversy ""over a usual custom in the West."" 'Happy' makes Pharrell cry . International backlash . Pharrell's not the only one unhappy about the arrests. The Twitter hashtag #FreeHappyIranians went viral. ""Is happiness a crime? @Pharrell #freehappyiranians,"" @MaedehHP tweeted. Others poked fun at the fan video's message. ""They deserve it for lying:) How can any body be #happy in #Tehran or #Iran for that matter,"" @Alothman123 wrote. The National Iranian American Council condemned Iranian authorities. ""There are forces within Iran's government who want to keep the Iranian people isolated from the world,"" the council said in a statement. ""The irony that the Iranian youth were arrested for dancing to a song called 'Happy' seems to be lost on the Iranian authorities."" Incidentally, the arrests came just days after Rouhani said citizens should take advantage of the Internet to communicate.

"The United Nations and international human rights groups joined a growing call on Monday urging the Iranian government to call off the impending execution of a 26-year-old woman convicted of murder. Reyhaneh Jabbari was sentenced to death for the 2007 killing of Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi, a former employee of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights alleges the killing was an act of self-defense against a rapist and says Jabbari never received a fair trial. In a statement on Monday, the U.N. Office said testimony from ""reliable sources"" indicates Sarbandi hired Jabbari -- then a 19-year old interior designer -- to work on his office. Jabbari stabbed Sarbandi after he sexually assaulted her, the statement said. The United Nations and several international rights groups say Jabbari's conviction was based on a false confession obtained under intense pressure and threats from Iranian investigators. ""The Iranian authorities should review her case and refer it back to court for a retrial, ensuring that the defendant due process rights guaranteed under both Iranian law and international law,"" said Ahmed Shaheed, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran. In a statement on Sunday, Amnesty International said, ""Sarbandi's association with the Ministry of Intelligence may have affected the impartiality of the court's investigation."" International calls to halt the execution grew louder on Monday after several reports came out that Jabbari would be executed on Tuesday. However, both Jabbari's lawyer and the spokesman for Iran's judiciary dismissed the reports, saying no date for the execution had been set. A Facebook page dedicated to saving Jabbari from execution has been created. As of Monday evening, it had more than 7,400 likes. The judiciary also held out the possibility that the family of Sarbandi would forgive the killer and agree to stay the execution, an option available under Iran's Islamic penal code. ""There was a lot of this type of guessing that suggested that the sentence may not be carried out if the people (next of kin of the man killed) agreed,"" said Judiciary spokesman Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, according to semi-official Mehr News Agency. ""There is still time until the date of execution of the sentence and the plaintiffs may at the last moment agree to clemency."" Iranian Oscar winner Asghar Farhadi has joined scores of Iranian artists and musicians in calling for a halt to the execution. In an open letter, Farhadi asked the victim's family to pardon Jabbari. ""If you pardon her, I will call that day the Day of Pardon,"" Farhadi wrote in his letter. Rights groups have criticized the Islamic Republic of Iran for a surge in executions under Hassan Rouhani, in his first year as President. According to the United Nations, Iran has executed at least 170 people this year. In 2013, Iran executed more people than any other country with the exception of China, the world's most populous nation. Iran, with almost 81 million people, is ranked 19th.

"A Louisiana man claims in a new book that his biological father was the notorious Zodiac Killer of northern California, who's still sought by authorities, publisher HarperCollins said Tuesday. The Zodiac serial killer is believed to have killed five people in 1968-69 and gained notoriety by writing several letters to police boasting of the slayings, with swatches of bloody clothing as proof of his claims. The serial killer claimed to have killed as many as 37 people and has never been caught. Now Gary L. Stewart, a vice president at the cleaning company Delta Tech Service in Baton Rouge, is recounting his decade-long search for his biological father and has concluded that man -- Earl Van Best, Jr., who's now dead -- was the Zodiac Killer, the publisher said. On Tuesday, police in northern California said they weren't aware of the book or its claims. ""It's an open and active case, so we don't comment,"" San Francisco police spokesman Albie Esparza told CNN. ""But (it's) certainly something our homicide investigators will take a look at."" Many claim to be child of the Zodiac killer . Added Capt. Steve Blower of the Napa County Sheriff's Office: ""We have talked to many people over the years.  We've gotten reports over the years from people who don't pan out. This case is still open, and we still do accept tips or leads that may have bearing on the case."" Bryan Hartnell, one of only two survivors of the Zodiac Killer, was just a college kid more than 40 years ago at Pacific Union College, just north of San Francisco, when he and a then-girlfriend, Cecilia Shephard, were attacked while picnicking. Their attacker was a man in an eerie costume: he wore a black hood and black shirt with a white symbol on the front that looked like crosshairs on a gun sight. That image would later become the Zodiac's trademark symbol. On Tuesday, Hartnell expressed reservations about the latest claim in the unsolved case. ""I somewhat follow the news, but there has been no time in the last 40+ years when someone was not (stirring) the pot,"" Hartnell wrote to CNN in an email. Hartnell was stabbed eight times, and Shephard, between 10 and 20 times. She died a day later at the hospital, but was able to give a description of the attacker before she died. Stewart was born in New Orleans and abandoned as a newborn in a stairwell of Baton Rouge apartment building. He was later adopted and ""had an idyllic childhood,"" the publisher said. About 10 years ago, when he was 39, Stewart's birth mother, Judy, contacted him for the first time. He then began his search for his biological father, with whom his mother hadn't been in contact since Stewart was abandoned. Stewart, who is married with a child, kept a journal during the search, which became the basis for the book. Stewart has bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Louisiana State University. His book, ""The Most Dangerous Animal of All: Searching for My Father ... and Finding the Zodiac Killer,"" was co-written with journalist Susan Mustafa. ""Stewart and Mustafa construct a chilling psychological profile of Stewart's father:  as a boy with disturbing fixations, as a frustrated intellectual with pretensions to high culture, and as an inappropriate suitor and then jilted lover unable to process his rage,"" the publisher said. HarperCollins publicist Tina Andreadis told New York Magazine that ""Stewart's father had a criminal record in San Francisco ('forgeries, bad checks'), and there was a strong resemblance between his father's mug shot and the police sketch,"" the magazine said. ""If you look at Gary's photo next to the sketch of the Zodiac (killer) next to his father's mug shot, you can see that there is very clearly more than just a passing resemblance,"" Andreadis told the magazine. ""They look alike."" The Zodiac Killer craved attention and wrote several letters to newspapers taking credit for his crimes. He also included cryptograms or ciphers that he claimed would shed light on his identity. But he was never caught. The unsolved case inspired the 2007 film ""Zodiac,"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo. Fast facts and photos: Serial killers .

They regard many facets of daily life as falling into a gray area -- open to their own selective interpretation, at least until the authorities catch up with them. That was the case when I decided to join 93-year-old Tono Torrente on a trip to the outskirts of Havana to a cockfighting arena. On paper, this was a privately operated, underground venue -- unsanctioned and unregulated by the Cuban state. For a semi-clandestine event, it was clear plenty of people seemed to know about it. As I picked my way down a short dirt track and past a couple of tethered oxen, I heard voices shouting and what sounded like scores of roosters crowing. In front of a metal gate, two men barred my way. ""There's a problem,"" they said. I assumed they were referring to the camera gear in my hands, or the fact I was a foreigner. ""Entrance fee will cost you 75 (Cuban) pesos,"" they said. That's the equivalent of about three U.S. dollars -- more than half a week's salary for a Cuban state worker. But for me, it was the price of passage into the twilight world of many ordinary Cubans, where rules are never quite what they seem. On the other side of the gate one of the first people I ran into was the event organizer. Not allowed, but not really forbidden . ""Well, this definitely isn't permitted but I don't really think it's forbidden,"" he said laughing and explaining he'd been staging cockfights every Saturday for the last 14 years. Many fans of the bloodsport had told me stories of how they had been at fights that had been raided by the police and were forced to run away to avoid arrest. When I asked this organizer how he had managed to sidestep sanctions for so long, he winked and placed two fingers on his shoulder -- a hint he was bribing a contact in the security services to turn a blind eye. Talking about official corruption, however, is highly frowned upon -- as well as bad for his business -- so I made my way ringside without further questions. The cockpit and small terraced stands were made of welded scraps of rusty metal. Not elegant, but highly effective. About 200 men and a handful of women and children were clinging to the bars, cheering on their favored rooster as it flapped and scrapped in a sawdust circle. My guide for the day, Tono Torrente, who lives miles away in ornate Old Havana, quickly filled me in on tactics. ""It's part technique and part luck,"" he said. ""In fact, it's mostly luck. It's a bit like life itself. If you were born to win then you'll win. But if you were born to lose, it doesn't matter how good you are, you'll end up like this,"" he said, flapping his arm and simulating the death of a rooster. I'd met Torrente a few days earlier as I searched for a barber's shop. The salon was closed, but Torrente sat nearby clipping the belly feathers off one of the four fighting cocks he is currently rearing. His birds are still too young and too underweight. He's feeding them corn and putting them on a strict training routine. But on the Saturday afternoon I joined him, he had no direct stake in the fights. Dollars exchange hands at the ring . Cockfighting itself may be somewhat a gray area -- the letter of the law appears to permit a handful state-run events at venues where health and safety measures are enforced but bans private events, like the one I was at. But Cuban law seems unequivocal in declaring gambling illegal. Prior to Fidel Castro's 1959 Revolution, the U.S. mafia controlled casinos and prostitution in Cuba. Thanks to the income from those rackets, the capos also had a say in how government was run. The revolution's law book somehow seemed to have been misplaced here on the outskirts of Havana. Gamblers shouted across the arena and flicked hand signs at one another, offering odds to any takers. When one rooster collapsed in a bloodied heap and the other was hoisted victorious, small wads of banknotes changed hands. On the sidelines of the cockfight, a man running a dice game on a green baize table invited me take to a photo. He quickly rescinded the offer when I reminded him dice games and gambling were illegal. ""You can't get rid of cockfighting, it's part of Cuban culture. It's the sport of the common people,"" one prize cock owner, who gave him name as Noel, told me. Beyond the question of legality, it's clear cockfighting is a passion for some in Cuba -- like in other parts of Latin America. Torrente told me he grew up in western Cuba alongside a cockpit. ""Ever since I was born there was a cockfighting arena near my house. The peasants would come on their horse to the fights. I used to love that, "" he said. Torrente's father died when he was just a boy. His uncle Antonio paid for his upbringing. His uncle left Cuba in the early 1920s for New York and worked as a traveling pharmaceutical salesman. Uncle Antonio used to send a check back to Torrente's mother every month. And when Torrente was 12 -- in the early 1930s -- his uncle sent for him and put him into school in New York. By his own admission, Torrente learned nothing and was an appalling student. He remembers swimming in the Hudson River when he should have been in class. His uncle sent him back to Havana after a year. ""They told my uncle not to waste any more of his money on my education. It wasn't worth it,"" Torrente explained. Women, cockfighting and boxing . By the time the Cuban Revolution came, Torrente says his uncle had purchased six or seven buildings in Havana as an investment. He had also gifted a barber's shop to Torrente who took up the trade. But Castro and his rebels stripped wealthy, absentee landowners like Torrente's Uncle Antonio of his property and redistributed some of it among society's poorest. Torrente was left with a single apartment where he's lived for the last 60 years. Three of his own children decided to leave Cuba and head to the United States. But Torrente says he refused to go for a very simple reason. ""Cockfighting was illegal in the United States. I didn't want to go,"" he said. ""When it boils down to it, I think life revolves around just three things: women, cockfighting and boxing,"" he said. In Cuba he had all three. Torrente is clearly no fan of Cuba's socialist system. ""It seemed that when the Revolution took place everything was going to change and get better. But for me and many others it didn't. They took away my barber's shop. They took my uncle's buildings. Now I get just $9 pension a month,"" he said. Then he gently placed his index finger on the tip of his tongue. ""But you can't speak too much about that,"" he said, reflecting the reticence of an older generations of Cubans not to openly voice criticism of the government to strangers. With U.S. President Barack Obama's December announcement to work towards normalization of ties with an old Cold War foe, Torrente is hopeful. He says he doubts he will live to see the Cuban government returning the property it expropriated from his uncle. But the easing of trade and travel restrictions will make it easier for his three children and grandchildren to come back and forth to visit from Florida. The changes will also allow his relatives, if they can afford it, to send higher value remittances to fund him in his retirement. Funding his retirement, of course, means funding his undying passion for fighting cocks. On sunny days, Torrente places his four raucous roosters in separate, small cages outside on the sidewalk. And while he is surely hoping for a thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations, he's reserving his biggest hope for a young rooster he calls Painted Indian. Torrente sets him on a rusty kitchen scale, holds up three fingers and says: . ""He weighs three pounds. Maybe in six months he'll be ready. I think he's going to be a great fighter.""","Visit to cockfighting ring on the edge of Havana is a study in contradictions .

"(CNN)On the foggy, icy Oregon interstate, Kaleb Whitby plowed into the back of a jackknifed semi truck, flipping his pickup. Then the real horror came: the sight of another tractor-trailer zooming straight toward him. ""When I saw those lights coming, I knew he was going to hit me,"" Whitby said. ""And then I closed my eyes and prayed that everything turned out OK. That was all I could do."" He gripped the steering wheel tightly as the second semi smashed through his pickup, crushing it like a soda can. ""It was just metal crunching and glass. It was just all fast and loud."" Whitby told CNN's ""New Day"" that he was a man of faith. ""I do believe, and I'm very firm in that, and I just held on to the wheel as tight as I could, tucked my head and just kept praying the whole time. After he hit, I just hoped that it would be over with soon,"" he said. The crash left only two things intact: The marred shell surrounding Whitby's seat, and Whitby, who was pinned between the two trucks. ""When the second truck hit my back end, it spun my bed underneath the first trailer that I hit and continued to swing my nose around, and I guess put my nose underneath the second trailer. And as that trailer came around, it just kind of pushed me down and further into that -- that small V where you can actually see both the trailers within arm's reach on both sides. And so if they would've pushed me even a foot, it would have crushed me,"" the 27-year-old father said. But he was alive. And alert. And nearly scratch-free. Whitby was part of a 26-vehicle pileup Saturday on Interstate 84 outside Baker City, Oregon. ""This is the biggest crash I have seen in a while,"" Oregon State Police Sgt. Kyle Hove said. ""It was extremely slick out there. One semi that spun around on the black ice started the chain reaction."" About a dozen people were injured, including two seriously. But there were no fatalities. ""It's surprising no one died in this,"" Hove said. Before trying to wiggle out, Whitby decided to let the sound of traffic subside ""to make sure things were OK."" Then passers-by came to help. ""One guy pulled my feet out just enough so I could slide out of the car."" Whitby's injuries? A bruise on his left eyebrow and a few scratches on his right hand. He told ""New Day"" he thanked God for his survival. ""I don't have the answers, and if I did, I probably wouldn't be doing what I'm doing now. When things like that happen, and what I've kinda come to realize, is that it is a miracle and that I need to take that into my life and remember it, and now I need to figure out who I need to be in this life and what I need to accomplish. ""Because how many people don't get the chance -- a second chance -- at escaping a situation like that?""","Kaleb Whitby was part of a 26-vehicle pileup on an icy Oregon interstate .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Rapper and actor Clifford Smith, better known to fans as Method Man, was arrested Monday and faces charges of failing to pay taxes, the district attorney in Richmond County, New York, said. Clifford Smith, better known as Method Man, failed to file tax returns and owes $33,000, authorities say. Smith, 38, owes the state nearly $33,000 for New York State income tax returns that he did not file between 2004 and 2007, district attorney Daniel Donovan Jr. said in a statement. The Grammy-winning rapper, an original member of the Wu-Tang Clan, was arrested at his home on Staten Island. He faces a felony charge of repeated failure to file taxes and a misdemeanor charge of failure to pay tax. The felony carries a sentence of up to four years in prison. Smith was to appear at an arraignment in Staten Island Criminal Court on Monday. Smith's attorney Peter Frankel was not immediately available to comment.","Clifford Smith, aka Method Man, didn't file state income tax returns, authorities say .

"Former San Diego Mayor Bob Filner was sentenced Monday to 90 days in home confinement, three years' probation, and a series of fines totaling about $1,500 for assaulting three women while in office. The 71-year-old pleaded guilty in October to forcibly kissing or grabbing three women at campaign events or at City Hall -- one a felony false imprisonment charge, the other two misdemeanor battery charges. Filner entered the guilty plea under a deal with prosecutors. The three women were among 19 who accused him of offensive behavior during his tenure as mayor and as a congressman. Filner will not serve prison time under the plea deal. GPS monitoring will track his whereabouts during his confinement. He'll be allowed to go out for medical and therapy appointments, religious services and meetings tied to his probation. He'll also be allowed to leave his apartment but stay within the apartment complex. ""I want to apologize to my family who have stood by me during this ordeal, to my loyal staff and supporters, to the citizens of San Diego, and most sincerely to the women I have hurt and offended,"" Filner said in prepared remarks at the start of the hearing. ""To all of you, I make the same promise I made to my family: to earn back your trust and my integrity no matter how long it takes and no matter what I have to do. I've already started on my path and I am grateful to all those who are helping me."" But the prosecution said Filner's behavior harmed the women and the city. Referring to the three women as Jane Does 1, 2, and 3, the state said Filner humiliated, scared, embarrassed, sexualized and devalued them. Prosecutors also noted that after taking part in two weeks of treatment earlier this year, Filner still denied his crimes ""and insisted that he was the victim of a lynch mob."" Filner resigns, says he faced 'lynch mob' hysteria . Filner's attorneys said they did not dispute any of the facts stated by the prosecution. None of the victims chose to be in court for the sentencing. The felony charge said Filner used force to restrain a woman at a fund-raising event March 6. The misdemeanor charges say he kissed a woman on the lips without her consent at City Hall on April 6 and grabbed a woman's buttock after she asked to have her picture taken with him at a rally on May 25. Filner was elected mayor in November 2012 after serving in Congress for 20 years. Filner's accusers . After veering between contrition and defiance, he resigned August 30. He offered a ""deep apology"" but also said he was the victim of the ""hysteria of a lynch mob."" Under the plea deal, which was announced in October, Filner would be prohibited from ever seeking or holding public office again, the attorney general's office said. Filner also would not be able to vote, serve on a jury or own a firearm while on probation. Filner also will have to give up pension credit for his time in the mayor's office after March 6, the date of the first offense.

"Washington (CNN)The strategy behind President Barack Obama's India trip. Race and the State of the Union speech. Mitt Romney's next steps. Sen. Lindsey Graham's big money goal. How Hillary Clinton's new team compares with her 2008 staff. These are all the hot topics around the ""Inside Politics"" table this week: . President Obama says he's on the offensive, and he has certainly unveiled an ambitious list of proposals in the weeks leading up to the State of the Union speech Tuesday night. But Julie Pace of The Associated Press notes that his schedule contradicts his rhetoric as he crosses into one of the indisputable stages of a lame-duck presidency: nonessential foreign travel. ""He's going to India basically for a parade and a visit to the Taj Mahal,"" said Pace. ""Think about the timing of this. The President is going to India three days after his State of the Union address. A period of time when he normally would be out trying to rally Congress and the public behind his agenda. I think this says all you need to know about the likelihood that anything he announces on Tuesday actually gets done."" What will Obama say about race and policing in the SOTU? Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post points out the issue has receded from the national conversation even as Attorney General Eric Holder has been taking the White House's message on increasing trust between law enforcement and communities around the country. And members of the Congressional Black Caucus, while celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy in Ferguson this weekend, are also pressing the President to include funding for body cameras in his annual budget. ""A lot of people waiting to see what the President will say, if anything, about race and policing on Tuesday,"" Henderson said. On Friday, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said he's ""seriously considering"" a 2016 presidential run but didn't reveal any more details about his plans. But The Washington Post's Robert Costa says Romney watchers might be getting additional information on Monday, when he is scheduled to give a paid speech -- with a Q&A scheduled -- to a corporate audience. ""This is his first public appearance since he spoke at the Republican National Committee on Friday,"" said Costa. ""And we're really going to have to see how much farther is Romney going to move? Is he going to send some more signals about his message and his pitch should he run for president?"" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie might be telling Republicans to ""relax"" about the race for the White House, but Sen. Lindsey Graham wants the GOP to get serious --- about his candidacy. CNN's Peter Hamby reports that Graham had a meeting with some of his top donors about a week ago in South Carolina and told them: ""In the first quarter of this year, I'm going to raise half a million dollars, go to early states, and see if there's a space for me in this field."" While Graham's candidacy might end up being more of an issue-driven campaign rather than a serious bid for the nation's top office, his run might cause some trouble for other candidates in an important early contest. ""If he does run, remember South Carolina is an early primary state and that would put a lot of his top donors and operatives in a pickle because usually they have their choice of candidates to support,"" said Hamby. ""But if their hometown guy runs for president, they're going to have a choice to make."" It has been more than a month now since Hillary Clinton held a public event, but that doesn't mean she is taking a break from politics. To the contrary. As has been widely reported, the former secretary of state is building a 2016 campaign team that looks very different from her 2008 high command. Her husband's former chief of staff -- John Podesta -- is leaving the Obama White House to lead ""Team Hillary.""  And two veterans of the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns will serve as Clinton's top strategist and chief media adviser. The biggest question is whether Clinton has been using this down time to hone her campaign rationale -- to answer liberal critics who say she is too cozy with Wall Street or Republican critics who label her more about the past than the future. But while awaiting her return to the public stage on Wednesday, even senior Republicans -- and those Democrats pushing to draft Elizabeth Warren -- concede her 2016 staff recruits are top notch.","What's the thinking behind President Obama's ""Passage to India""?

"(CNN)A teen couple from Kentucky was arrested Sunday after two weeks on the run following a series of car and gun thefts. Dalton Hayes, 18, and Cheyenne Phillips, 13, were arrested in Panama City Beach, Florida, authorities said. The two are suspected of stealing three cars -- two with guns inside -- in various states. They were the subjects of a search that stretched from Kentucky to Georgia. Authorities discovered them asleep in a Toyota Tundra stolen in Georgia, the Grayson County Sheriff's Office in Kentucky said in a statement. ""The vehicle was surrounded by law enforcement, and both Hayes and Phillips were taken into custody without further incident,"" the sheriff's office said. Officials are trying to get them extradited back to Kentucky to face multiple felony charges. During their time on the run, authorities described the young couple as ""increasingly brazen and dangerous."" ""I know Dalton, and he has a history of making bad, bad decisions,""  Sheriff Norman Chaffins said. ""I was the school resource officer before I was elected sheriff. Dalton is known to have disciplinary and defiance issues at the high school with authority."" Hayes was recently charged with burglary and was out on bond, the sheriff said. Cheyenne's family reported her missing January 3 from Clarkson, Kentucky. Hayes' relatives said they last heard from him in a text message on January 6. Chaffins said the couple first stole a truck in Clarkson. Jim McGrew, its owner, told CNN affiliate WAVE the teens took the truck out of his garage and sped down the road before crashing into a fence and fleeing on foot. The wreck caused about $7,100 in damage to his truck, he said. An hour later, they stole a Toyota Tacoma pickup truck with a firearm inside, authorities said. That pickup was recovered in Henry County, Georgia, just south of Atlanta. This week, the sheriff's department said the couple was spotted on security-camera video at a Walmart store in Manning, South Carolina. A Toyota Tundra pickup with a Georgia firefighter license plate was reported stolen from the area around the same time. That truck had two handguns inside -- a .38-caliber and a .45-caliber, the sheriff's department said.","Dalton Hayes and Cheyenne Phillips are suspected of stealing three cars .

"(CNN)The mayor of Danbury, Connecticut, appears to be the first to give the Northeast's ice storm a hashtag: #Icezilla. Mark Boughton tweeted updates to his constituents about the icy weather; some of them were enduring interruptions on the metro this weekend as freezing rain coated Connecticut and Pennsylvania and pelted New Jersey and New York. ""Still slippery, but calls are slowing down in our 911 center. #Danbury #Icezilla,"" Boughton tweeted. Don't drive. Just don't do it, fire and police officials are urging. They said every surface is slick: Bridges, overpasses, interstates. A photo on the Danbury Fire Police Facebook page shows a lighted road sign that says, ""The roads are wicked slippery!"" Pennsylvania Department of Transportation spokesman Charles Metzger said conditions will warm as the day goes on, but it will continue to rain throughout the day. Two people have died in accidents related to black ice in the Philadelphia area, state police said. After crashing into at least 20 cars piled up on Interstate 76, one person was killed after getting out of a car and being hit by an oncoming vehicle,  authorities said. Black ice coated Interstate 95 near the city, law enforcement told CNN, and there was an accident at every mile marker. Pile-ups shut down parts of both interstates, a dispatcher said. At least one person has died in Harford County, Maryland, said State Police spokesman Greg Shipley. There have been dozens of crashes throughout central and northern Maryland on Sunday, he said. Most of them occurred in Howard, Baltimore, Harford and Cecil counties. Troopers who had worked through the night kept working when their shifts were over, and more troopers were called in to help assist passengers who had accidents, he said. Statewide, Shipley estimates that at least 100 car accidents have occurred. ""The State Highway Administration is out in force salting"" bridges, ramps and overpasses, he said. The slick roads are causing the highest number of traffic accidents this winter in New Jersey, said State Police Sgt.  Jeff Flynn. There have been 428 accidents and 186 calls to help people who have been in accidents in areas that the police are patrolling, he said Sunday morning. There could be other accidents the department isn't aware of yet. ""So this isn't even the whole picture,"" Flynn told CNN. Even a salt truck slid and crashed into three cars East Orange, New Jersey, according to CNN affiliate News12. Flynn knows that no matter how much officials urge people to stay off the roads, many will choose to drive or feel they have to drive. ""If you have to be out,"" Flynn said, ""drive slower than you would in the snow."" The cold is also wracking other states this weekend. Winter storm warnings are in effect through Monday morning for upstate Vermont and portions of New Hampshire, Maine and western Massachusetts. In Vermont, there could be between 3 and 7 inches of snow and 10 inches in the state's highest elevations.","Ice storms hit Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Sen. Hillary Clinton raised $27 million in the third quarter for her 2008 Democratic bid for the White House, a Clinton aide said Tuesday. Presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton raised $27 million in the third quarter, a Clinton aide said. All but $5 million of Clinton's funds can be spent trying to win the Democratic presidential nomination in the primaries, the aide said. More than 100,000 new donors contributed to the New York Democrat, the aide said. Clinton outpaced Sen. Barack Obama over the last three months, a reversal of positions from the second quarter. The Obama campaign announced Monday the Illinois Democrat raised at least $20 million for his presidential campaign during the third quarter.  All but about $1 million of Obama's contributions can be used in the primary fight. In the second quarter, he shattered fundraising records by reporting he raised $32.5 million, $31 million of which he can use in his bid for the Democratic nod. Clinton raised $27 million during this same period; all but $6 million can be used in the primaries. Fundraising is historically slow in the third quarter, which covers the final two months of summer and the first month of fall.  Watch how summer can be a tough time for candidates » . Campaign finance laws limit the amount an individual can contribute to a candidate during the primary cycle to $2,300. At the same time, individuals can contribute another $2,300 to a candidate for the general election. Campaigns often report the total of contributions for the primary and general cycles during a quarter, even though general election contributions can't be used immediately to buy ads or hire staff. ""Many in Washington have spent the last weeks declaring the outcome of this race to be preordained and the primary process a mere formality,"" said Obama campaign chief David Plouffe in a veiled reference to Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in most national polls. ""Yet, in this quarter alone, 93,000 more Americans joined our campaign, because they desire real change and believe Barack Obama is the one candidate who can deliver it,"" Plouffe said. ""This grass-roots movement for change will not be deterred by Washington conventional wisdom, because in many ways it is built to challenge it."" Obama's campaign said the senator has raised at least $74.9 million in primary funds so far this year from 352,000 donors. In a conference call Monday, John Edwards' campaign announced the former U.S. senator from North Carolina raised $7 million during the third quarter. Edwards, the party's 2004 vice presidential nominee, said last week he would accept public financing for the primary and general election campaigns, challenging Clinton and Obama to do the same. Edwards' deputy campaign manager, Jonathan Prince, said the campaign has $12 million in cash. Prince said public funding will add $10 million to its totals. Edwards has raised more than $30 million so far, and the campaign is on the right track to reaching its goal of $40 million by January, Prince said. Crediting the campaign's aggressive grass-roots outreach, Prince said Edwards received donations from 150,000 Americans, with 97 percent of contributions less than $250. Edwards raised more than $9 million in the second quarter. On Sunday, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson reported campaign contributions of $5.2 million for the third quarter, which his campaign said supports his claim that he is a top-tier candidate. ""This figure obviously separates us from the second-tier candidates and makes clear this is a four-person race,"" Richardson's campaign said. Most political observers put Clinton, Obama and Edwards as the first-tier candidates for the Democratic nomination. Though $5.2 million is down from the $7 million reported in the second quarter, the Richardson campaign touted it as ""a strong showing in a historically difficult fundraising period."" ""Most importantly, this amount ensures we will have the resources we need to compete in the early states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina,"" it said. ""We have strong organizations in those states and continue to expand our field operations by adding staff and opening new offices."" The campaign did not disclose how much it had spent during the quarter or how much cash it had left. Candidates have until October 15 to file a full report with the Federal Election Commission. On the Republican side, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney are expected to battle again for the top spot. Romney raised nearly $35 million so far this year, with Giuliani $1.5 million behind. Sources close to the Giuliani campaign said their candidate expects to be atop the pack for the third quarter. Among the GOP candidates, former Sen. Fred Thompson will have his numbers closely scrutinized. Thompson raised more than $8 million for his late-starting presidential campaign in the past three months, a Thompson campaign source said Monday. Thompson's upcoming FEC report also will show 70,000 donors have contributed to the Tennessee Republican in the third quarter, according to the source, who requested anonymity because the campaign has not officially released the information. The actor, a former ""Law & Order"" star, formally entered the presidential race last month, but he has been raising money since June. Thompson raised close to $3.5 million from about 9,000 donors in June, the final month of the second quarter. Sen. John McCain of Arizona is expected to show he raised more than $5 million this quarter, but a McCain adviser said recent poll numbers in New Hampshire and a busy fundraising schedule next month show the campaign has ""some life."" McCain raised $24.5 million the first two quarters of the year but spent nearly all of the funds raised. Lower numbers are expected for Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, Sen. Tom Tancredo of Colorado and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. E-mail to a friend .

"Lebanese authorities have arrested a wife of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi -- the man spearheading the Islamist terror group's sweeping rampage across Syria and Iraq -- said a source with knowledge of the arrest. The woman is one of al-Baghdadi's two wives. Her arrest came as part of a ""planned operation,"" according to the source. The source described her as a ""powerful figure (who is) heavily involved in ISIS."" Not much is known about the reported wife, including what her involvement is with the terrorist group, if any. ""We will gain some intelligence from her. We may get insights into al-Baghdadi's movement, who he surrounds himself with, whether he was injured, and the degree of his injuries,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat. Another intelligence source identified the wife as Saja al-Dulaimi. She was detained with her 4-year-old son more than a week ago when they tried to enter Lebanon, that source said. The arrest was a coordinated operation involving agencies from Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, said the intelligence source. The source said the Iraqis had help from U.S. intelligence. In Washington, the CIA declined to comment. Also in Washington, several American sources suggested the person arrested was al-Baghdadi's ex-wife, not a current one. Al-Baghdadi has been calling for the release of his son, the intelligence source said, adding that al-Dulaimi was released from Syrian custody in March as part of a group of 150 women who were freed in exchange for a group of Syrian nuns. The Greek Orthodox nuns had been kidnapped and held captive by the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, which al-Baghdadi had helped establish. Lebanese authorities didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from CNN. Agence France-Presse, citing unidentified Lebanese security officials, reported one of al-Baghdadi's sons was detained. But Reuters, also citing Lebanese officials, said that a daughter, rather than a son, was being held. The two agencies similarly differed on when the two were picked up by Lebanese forces: Reuters said it happened ""in recent days;"" AFP reported it was 10 days ago. Regardless, the very idea that a government may be holding close relatives of al-Baghdadi is significant, given his pivotal role in ISIS' meteoric rise, the extremist group's widely reviled tactics under his leadership and the breadth of the international coalition aimed at defeating ISIS. ""It's certainly a new dynamic because we've never seen anybody connected so close to al-Baghdadi being detained,"" terrorism expert Sajjan M. Gohel said. At the same time, the reports raise a lot of questions, such as what the family members might have been doing in Lebanon. ""Is he estranged from them? Has he fallen out with them? Were they escaping from him?"" asked Gohel, who is the international security director at the Asia Pacific Foundation. Lebanon is one of several countries heavily affected by Syria's yearslong conflict and the flood of refugees trying to escape the violence. Lebanese authorities ""have been cracking down very heavily on the border to prevent members of ISIS seeping into Lebanon,"" Gohel said. ""They don't want the problems spilling over from Iraq and Syria into their territory."" Another question raised by the reports is whether the wife is affiliated with ISIS. ""If she's simply an ex-wife, the first thing you got to deal with is she's an innocent person, potentially, who was married to a bad guy, with a child,"" said Philip Mudd, a former CIA counterterrorism official. ""The first hurdle ... before we deal with what she knows, is how closely was she affiliated, and how hard can you press her based on that affiliation.  That's an ethical question,"" he said. Mystery surrounds arrest of woman who may be ISIS leader's wife . ISIS rises after al-Baghdadi took over . The group that in 2006 would become ISIS began in Iraq, where it targeted the U.S.-led coalition as well as Shiite Muslims in the country. It suffered heavy losses, but ascended over the past few years to take advantage of a void wrought by Syria's civil war as well as instability in Iraq. Not coincidentally, this all happened after al-Baghdadi took over ISIS in 2010. Before that, he'd been at a U.S. prison camp for insurgents at Bucca in southern Iraq, where he was taken after being detained in February 2004 amid fighting in the flashpoint city of Falluja. Media reports have claimed U.S. authorities held al-Baghdadi for four years. But the Pentagon has offered a different  time line, saying he was at Camp Bucca until early December 2004, when officials there recommended his ""unconditional release."" Beyond this, little is known about al-Baghdadi. According to the U.S. government, he was born in Samarra, Iraq, and is in his early 40s. What motivates him, how he was trained and who he's close to -- including his family -- largely remains a mystery. He has emerged from the shadows in fits and spurts. After the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011, al-Baghdadi issued a eulogy in which he threatened violent retribution. (Al Qaeda disowned ISIS earlier this year, blaming it for ""the enormity of the disaster that afflicted"" others trying to unseat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.) There were unconfirmed suggestions last month that al-Baghdadi had been wounded in airstrikes in northern Iraq. But days later, an audio recording emerged that purportedly contained a message from al-Baghdadi saying the U.S.-led coalition to destroy ISIS is ""terrified, weak and powerless."" 'He's created this myth' ISIS itself has never been more powerful, having taken over vast swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria in the past few years. And it has used brutal tactics to do so -- such as mass kidnappings, rapes, killings and other abuses against civilians and fighting foes alike, actions that a U.N. panel characterized as war crimes and crimes against humanity. Al-Baghdadi, who has gone by a variety of aliases during his career in terrorism, has been at the center of it. The U.S. State Department's Reward's for Justice program, which refers to him as ""Abu Du'a,"" offers $10 million for information leading to his arrest. When his group rebranded itself as the Islamic State in June, al-Baghdadi was tapped as spiritual leader of the new caliphate. He's sought to burnish his theological credentials, with a biography posted on jihadist websites last year claiming he had earned a doctorate in Islamic studies from a university in Baghdad. ""His knowledge in Islamic jurisprudence is somewhat dubious, but nevertheless he's created this myth and this aura behind him,"" Gohel said.","Woman part of a group freed in exchange for a group of nuns, intelligence source says .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- With hundreds of protesters gathering and riot police out in force on the streets of Tehran, hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took the oath of office Wednesday, beginning a second term in a bitterly divided Iran. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was sworn in Wednesday as Iran's president. He begins his second term. Ahmadinejad, 52, was formally sworn in before Iran's parliament, known as the Majlis, as security forces guarded the building and nearby streets in anticipation of protests. Witnesses reported a heavy police presence -- including members of the pro-government Basij militia -- and several choppers hovering overhead. Some reported protesters, many of them women, sitting in front of the parliament building's entrance. As discontent surfaced yet again, Ahmadinejad vowed to take Iran forward and flung sharp words at those who questioned the validity of the June 12 elections, in which he was declared the winner with almost two-thirds of the vote. He took particular aim at the United States, Britain, France, Italy and Germany, which have not sent formal letters of congratulations to Ahmadinejad. ""They said they would recognize the election, but will not congratulate,"" Ahmadinejad said in his inaugural speech. ""This means they only want democracy at the service of their interests and don't respect the people's vote and rights. ""Nobody in Iran is waiting for anyone's congratulations,"" he said.  What's next for Iran? » . Asked Tuesday whether the White House recognizes Ahmadinejad as the rightful leader of Iran, press secretary Robert Gibbs said, ""He's the elected leader."" Gibbs expanded on that comment Wednesday, telling reporters ""It's not for me or for us to denote his legitimacy, except to acknowledge the fact."" ""Whether any election was fair, obviously the Iranian people still have questions about that, and we'll let them decide that,"" Gibbs said. ""But I would simply say he's been inaugurated, and we know that is simply a fact."" The United States and Iran have had no diplomatic relations since 1980. Britain has maintained ties, but has criticized the Iranian crackdown on protests that followed the disputed election and has not issued a statement of congratulation to Ahmadinejad. However, the British ambassador to Tehran did attend the ceremony, and the Foreign Office in London said the international community still needs to engage Iran on ""serious issues,"" such as its nuclear program. ""While we need to engage with Iran's government, today's ceremony does not change our position on Iran's elections,"" the Foreign Office said. Among others attending Wednesday's ceremony were Iran's top lawmakers, the heads of the three branches of government, the secretary of the Guardian Council and foreign diplomats. But as the camera of the semi-official Press TV panned the hall, an unprecedented number of empty seats were visible. It was unclear whether opposition leaders were boycotting the inauguration. Ahmadinejad struck a note of unity in his attempt to move Iran forward, saying ""Who has voted for whom -- this is not the question. Today we need a national resolve. Today we need to join forces."" He vowed to promote religion and morality, and support righteousness and spread justice. ""I will guard the power that the people have entrusted in me as the sacred trust,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""I will safeguard it like an honest and faithful trustee."" Ahmadinejad, however, starts another four years in office with many Iranians questioning his legitimacy. The results of the June 12 election were widely disputed; Ahmadinejad's chief rival, reformist Mir Hossein Moussavi called the elections a ""fraud."" Since the vote, Iran has seen turmoil not witnessed since the 1979 Islamic revolution as thousands have taken to the streets to protest and security forces have brutally cracked down. Analyst Amir Taheri told CNN Wednesday that Ahmadinejad's second term will be closely watched around the world. Taheri said the freshly inaugurated president faces myriad challenges in his second term, among them a faltering economy and a burgeoning popular movement favoring reform. ""He has to worry a lot about the opposition,"" Taheri said. Iran says about 30 people have been killed in the post-election violence. Among those who were arrested, 110 are facing trial, according to Iranian media reports. Under Iran's constitution, the incoming president must receive the supreme leader's approval before being sworn into office. On Monday, after Ayatollah Ali Khameini gave that endorsement to Ahmadinejad, hundreds of Iranians again demonstrated in the Iranian capital. Witnesses and sources said the crowds marched on the sidewalks around Vannak Square and Vali Asr Avenue, under the watchful eye of hundreds of Iranian security forces. Some chanted ""Death to the dictator,"" while others said ""God is great."" International media outlets, including CNN, have been restricted in their coverage of Iran in the aftermath of the elections.","Mahmoud Ahmadinejad begins a second term as Iran's president .

"For about a month, Barbara Gattuso felt at least 40 years younger. Gattuso, 65, had enrolled in a clinical trial for a drug aimed at women who have low sexual desire. There is no treatment available in the United States for boosting the female sex drive, but women like Gattuso hoped that would change with this experimental medication, called flibanserin. ""It was amazing, absolutely amazing, and it just makes you feel whole,"" Gattuso said, recalling her feeling of taking this drug. ""It makes you feel like a complete woman again."" Outside such experimental settings, there are no medications available in the United States for female hypoactive sexual desire disorder. That's the technical term for when women have a distressing lack or absence of sexual desire or fantasy. Up to one-third of adult women may experience it, according to a 2002 study. Flibanserin seemed like a potential answer for many. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has rejected applications to green-light the drug. Sprout Pharmaceuticals, which is pursuing approval of the drug, has appealed the FDA's most recent decision, and was scheduled to have a meeting with FDA officials on Friday, said the company's president and chief operating officer, Cindy Whitehead. Given that the drug has been through numerous, rigorous clinical trials, and so much has been invested in it, the FDA's refusal to approve it is a turning point in the field of sexual medicine, says Dr. Irwin Goldstein, director of sexual medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, California, who collaborated on clinical trials for flibanserin. If there is no positive action on the drug, it could spell doom for pharmacological efforts to manage female sexual desire, he said. ""It will go back to dark ages of saying, 'This is all a relationship problem,' even though we know it's not,"" he said. The FDA declined to answer specific questions regarding the matter. FDA spokeswoman Andrea Fischer said in a statement: ""The FDA is only able to provide information on approved drug product applications. Any information on an application that has yet to receive an approval or was denied approval belongs to the manufacturer/sponsor developing the drug."" Sprouting a drug . Flibanserin was initially developed by pharmaceutical giant Boehringer Ingelheim, but the company ditched it in 2010 after the FDA declined to approve their new drug application, asking for more research, Goldstein said. A smaller operation, Sprout Pharmaceuticals, took over work on the drug in 2011, and resubmitted an application with 14 new clinical studies, encompassing data on more than 3,000 new patients, according to the company. In total, more than 11,000 people have participated in clinical trials for flibanserin, Whitehead said. Still, the most recent attempt to get flibanserin off the ground failed; the FDA did not approve the company's revised drug application in October. The FDA characterized the drug as having a ""modest"" effect in its response letter, Whitehead said. But clinical trial results show statistically significant improvement in the women who took the drug, compared to those who took a placebo, she said. ""In terms of what we see, I would say 'modest' is meaningful,"" Whitehead said. Sex is doctor's life's work . A 2013 study in the Journal of Sexual Medicine showed that women taking the drug reported an average increase of 2.5 satisfying sexual events in four weeks, compared to an increase of 1.5 among women using a placebo. Flibanserin is not a hormonal treatment and does not appear to affect fertility or interact with birth control medications, Whitehead said. The drug works by increasing brain blood flow in particular ways, Goldstein said. It increases levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline, and lowers levels of serotonin. Side effects of flibanserin include dizziness, nausea, fatigue and sleepiness. Unlike some treatments for men, flibanserin needs to be taken once a day, every day. Other options . There are other experimental treatments for low female sex drive in the works. Drugs called Lybrido and Lybridos, developed by a company called Emotional Brain, have undergone several randomized studies with results that are ""very promising and will be published soon,"" according to the company's website. A drug called Bremelanotide is being investigated by Palatin Technologies for both men and women. None of these drugs has completed phase 3 trials, which are necessary before approval. Whitehead counts 24 FDA-approved treatments available in the United States for male sexual dysfunction, including popular drugs such as Viagra (sildenafil citrate). For women, it's zero. ""A lot of times, the medical community has really put men's needs first and hasn't really addressed women's sexual needs,"" said Jennifer Foust, a sex therapist in Aventura, Florida, who is not affiliated with flibanserin. Because doctors have no solutions, women have tried less-proven treatments for their low sexual desire, such as diets and herbs. None of Foust's clients has had success with them. She said some women who aren't functioning well sexually would be ""open to anything."" ""I've had women complain, 'Why isn't there a female Viagra?' "" Foust said. Sex drive: It's complicated . Sex drive is more complicated for women than for men, Foust said. There are a lot of factors that could explain a woman's low desire -- and not all of them are medical, she said. Lifestyle and relationship issues may come into play. Having a first child can be a problematic factor for some women; the adjustment and figuring out how to restructure their sex life can throw off desire. Foust has spoken to some new mothers who feel they are constantly being asked for something from their body, as if they are ""touched out,"" but find their lack of desire troubling. Some couples maintain satisfying sex lives over many years -- but some, over time, go on autopilot and have less and less sex. ""You have to continue to feed your sexual relationship, and feed your relationship in general,"" Foust said. ""A lot of it depends on how much importance and energy you put toward your sex life."" Sometimes stress is the issue, too, she said. Foust offers cognitive-behavioral, focused exercises to help women who are distressed about their low sexual desire. Low sexual desire in women isn't necessarily a problem in menopause or later. Foust works with many women complaining of low sex drive who are in their 30s and 40s. The average age of participants in the flibanserin trials was 36, Whitehead said. Gattuso's daughter is in her late 30s, and she and her friends are having similar problems, Gattuso said. Her physician friends want a solution for low female sexual desire, too, she said; they want to be able to offer female patients something besides ""I'm sorry.""

"There has been another confirmed case of a mysterious new SARS-like virus. The Saudi health ministry informed the World Health Organization that a 39-year-old man was hospitalized with the novel coronavirus on February 28 and died two days later. So far, WHO has recorded 15 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, including nine deaths, since the fall. The Saudi patient did not appear to have had any contact with anyone who was already infected. As a result, WHO is investigating other potential exposure sources. Symptoms . The novel coronavirus is in the same family as SARS. SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, virus sickened 8,000 people and killed 774 between 2002 and 2003. Symptoms of the novel coronavirus include an acute respiratory infection, fever and a cough. And it could lead potentially to pneumononia and kidney failure. The first cases were found to have occurred in an Amman, Jordan, hospital, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cases . Most of the people who've caught the virus have been in the Middle East. But there have been cases reported in the United Kingdom as well. One of the U.K. patients had traveled to Saudi Arabia. Upon return, he infected two other family members. ""Once it gets you, it's a very serious infection,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. Fortunately, he added, the virus is ""very difficult to acquire."" While the SARS epidemic was going on, many of those caring for patients were infected too.  The fact that this hasn't been seen with these cases so far is a good sign, Schaffer said. Origin . It's suspected that, like SARS, the virus originated in animals. A study published in November found that genetically, the new coronavirus was most closely related to viruses found in bats. While no cases have popped up in the United States, doctors say they won't be shocked if it did. ""It could happen,"" said Dr. Susan Gerber, a medical epidemiologist in the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases. ""That's why the CDC is working closely with the World Health Organization and other international partners."" Spread . WHO has asked member states to keep an eye out for severe acute respiratory infections and review them for unusual patterns. It did not recommend travel or trade restrictions for countries where the virus has been found. Dr. Susan Gerber, a medical epidemiologist in the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases, agrees. There's no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, she said, ""where you see a chain of many cases going person to person to person."" ""People shouldn't freak out,"" she added. ""There's no evidence that this virus is easily spread, say, across a room.""","So far, there have been 15 confirmed cases .

"No Christmas is complete without a war on Christmas, and this year it's being fought on several fronts. NPR reported the White House attacking Republican intransigence over the debt talks in a report with a section titled ""The Holiday Season is No Time to Threaten Middle-Class Pocketbooks."" That prompted the Daily Caller to respond with the headline, ""Disagreeing with Obama can ruin Christmas, says White House report."" In the eyes of some liberals, the Republicans have become the party of the Grinch. This must be news to conservatives who have always insisted that it's the Democrats who want to steal Christmas. To them, the war is being waged by liberal secularists against patriotic American Christians who want to celebrate the holiday loudly and publicly in the way Baby Jesus intended. Pat Robertson has hit out at those ""miserable"" atheists and Fox News has gone after Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee for deciding not to host a Christmas tree lighting ceremony. In other words, although the war on Christmas phenomenon might have something to do with rising unbelief among Americans, more likely it reflects growing partisanship among politicians. In an age when nothing is so sacred it can't be used to hurt a political opponent, Christmas is one more weapon that statesmen and stateswomen can use against each other. But the meaning of the war on Christmas is actually bigger than  partisan tomfoolery and isn't limited to right-wing fantasy, either. Some of it exposes genuine tensions within American politics and society. Take the decision of the Santa Monica City Council to end the tradition of erecting nativity scenes or other displays in Palisades Park. The right to display a scene was hitherto decided by lottery, and the previous winter season atheists won 11 out of 14 spaces, which they used to erect enormous critiques of Christianity. In response, locals lobbied the council to establish stricter guidelines about who could take part. The council decided that would be discriminatory, but it also didn't want to leave the system open to abuse by more offensive groups like neo-Nazis. So it decided the displays would have to stop altogether. That decision was upheld in November by a federal judge. The local secularists were thrilled. ""The free thinkers ... played the game of the religionists and they outsmarted them,"" Annie Laurie Gaylor told the Huffington Post. ""They showed the Christian people of the city what it feels like to have a public park promoting views that offend your personal conscience. These views were on public property that were supposed to be owned equally by everyone."" This story is a classic example of the failure to reconcile different interests within a democratic society. Nobody involved was technically wrong. The secularist campaigners were right to say that the nativity displays should be open to everyone because they were on public land. Their Christian opponents were right to insist that anything erected to celebrate Christmas ought to give some priority to celebrating Christmas. And the council was right that, in the absence of consensus, it was better to allow no displays at all. The tragedy being that Gaylor's campaign ended up destroying a perfectly wonderful tradition in the name of fairness. And that hardly seems fair. Unfortunately, Gaylor gets around almost as much as Santa Claus; now she's involved in an effort to take down a Jesus-shaped war memorial near a popular ski resort in Montana. There's a thin line between this sort of secularist activism and the politics of personal taste. In Portsmouth, New Hampshire, a jewelry shop manager called the cops on Salvation Army bell ringers because the noise was ""raising her blood pressure and making her hate Christmas."" In Colorado Springs, the Salvation Army was stopped from bell ringing because of a new ban on panhandling. What's really happening isn't just a targeted, political war on Christmas but a more general battle for control of what goes on in the public sphere, especially around the holidays. Undoubtedly, some of this is motivated by anti-religious secularism. But it's also the product of living in a crowded multicultural environment where everyone risks getting on each other's nerves -- and we have to find better ways of getting along. One of the reasons why ""Happy Holidays"" has risen in use as an alternative seasonal greeting to ""Merry Christmas"" is simply that it helps avoid occasions of offense and confrontation. Religious conservatives complain that it's a surrender to militant atheism. But if that's the case then the surrender is widespread. George W. Bush's White House cards wished everyone a happy ""holiday season"" and even Fox News has its own Holiday Wish List. If there is a solution to this controversy then perhaps it's to try to treat it with a dash of humor and disdain. The Rev. Jonathan Morris was recently invited on ""Fox and Friends"" to unleash hell on the war on Christmas. Instead, he did the opposite. After pointing out that Christians have throughout the centuries taken much worse persecution (and, I might add, dished out a bit, too) he concluded, ""If our Christmas is going to be all about getting upset at people trying to take away Christmas, isn't that silly, too?"" Amen, Father.","Tim Stanley: It's not Christmas without ""War on Christmas,"" a cooked up culture crisis .
This time, politics in mix, with White House, others using holidays to score points, he says .
He says ""war"" really reflects failure to reconcile different interests in democratic society .
Stanley: Battle is over what goes on in public sphere. One solution? Have sense of humor ."
"(CNN)Truth and reconciliation. As we mark Martin Luther King Jr. Day this year, it's worth asking: Can America handle either one? When Nelson Mandela became president of South Africa after the end of apartheid he had two choices. He could have gone down a path of confrontation and retribution against the white Afrikaners who had ruled so oppressively. Or he could have skipped quickly past the history and reality of apartheid and pardoned all its perpetrators in the interests of maintaining order. He did neither. In one of his many acts of civic genius, he chose a path for his country that exposed the ugliness of the past and only then invited forgiveness. His government launched a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The commission gathered public testimony across the land, naming the institutional structures and individual acts that had brutalized blacks. No perpetrator was granted amnesty without a candid accounting of his or her deeds. The opportunity for restorative justice gave every participant a sense of heightened responsibility -- a chance to be bigger citizens, together. Only then could reconciliation begin. And though the commission was not sufficient to ""solve race"" in post-apartheid South Africa, it was still necessary. Without such an attempt at formal accounting, without such an opportunity for oppressed and oppressor to face one another, that nation's challenges would be even greater today. For proof, consider our own nation 150 years post-slavery. For a fleeting while after the Civil War, we tried Reconstruction. Freedmen could earn wages and vote freely and claim an equal place in politics. Then we gave up on Reconstruction. And Jim Crow came along to make black citizens second-class and to ensure that neither truth-telling nor reconciliation would be on the agenda. Consider our nation 50 years post-civil rights movement. That movement is sometimes called the Second Reconstruction. It sought to finish the fight to make truly equal citizens out of the descendants of slaves. But here we are today, still plagued post-Ferguson and post-Staten Island by divisions of color and caste -- and by an inability to talk about them without angry defensiveness. That's why it's worth asking whether the United States today could take a page from South Africa's script. Fania Davis, a civil rights attorney and restorative justice activist in Oakland, California, has proposed just that. In a widely circulated essay in Yes! Magazine, Davis argues that Ferguson, Missouri, needs a truth and reconciliation commission on extrajudicial violence against African-Americans -- and that America does, too. You can hear the objections already. For instance: Won't cataloging acts of racism from the past just make it harder for us all to get along? But of course, racism is not only in the past. It did not end with the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 or with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It is present in the acts and attitudes of many today. It is present in the institutional residue of past choices. That the phrase #BlackLivesMatter must be said says it all. The criminal justice system, the education system, the economic system and (as this year's so-white Oscars remind us) the pop culture system -- all of them value black lives, black voices and black experience less than fully. We must all face that fact. There's also this objection to a commission: that by racializing everything it would basically be racist. Consider the words of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who, arguing against affirmative action, once wrote that ""[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race."" This tidy tautology flattens out history. It obliterates the difference between injury and remedy. It wants to rush us along to a ""colorblindness"" that our society hasn't yet earned and perhaps shouldn't even seek as an ideal. As a Chinese American, I am an inheritor of what white people wrote in the Constitution and what they did to subvert it. I am the beneficiary of what black people and people of every color have done to redeem the Constitution. I am sometimes the object of a presumption that yellow people are presumed foreign until proven otherwise. I own the good, the bad and the ugly of this country. None of this is neat. None of it is colorblind either. Ultimately the deepest objection to a racial truth and reconciliation process in America is that it would be hard. Hard to start and to finish. We Americans can be a bit lazy when it comes to messy civic and historical truths. We want our stories -- and our Story -- to have happy endings. We want reconciliation on the cheap. But the point of MLK Day, and of MLK's entire life, is that true redemption is never cheap or easy. So to honor him truly, let's commit to what's hard. Whether through official commissions or citizen conversations, let's face ourselves.","Eric Liu: MLK lesson for all of us is that true redemption is never cheap or easy .
Liu: Post-Ferguson, we're still divided by color; it's time for reconciliation ."
"(CNN)Shin Dong-hyuk's horrific descriptions of his time in a North Korean prison camp became a best-selling book, made him a key witness before the United Nations and grabbed headlines around the world. He was one of the most high-profile North Korean defectors, winning several human rights awards and inspiring a documentary as his memoir was translated into 27 languages. Now the publisher of the book and its author say Shin -- who claims to have been born in and escaped from a North Korean prison camp -- has revealed that parts of the story he told weren't true. Shin may have spent most of his life in North Korea at a different prison camp, rather than the total control zone that formed the title of his biography. Shin's accounts of his time in the gulag have been widely reported in interviews with media including CNN. He also wrote an opinion piece describing his experiences for CNN Digital. Don't discount N. Korean stories after defector's recanting, advocates say . Blaine Harden, author of the book ""Escape from Camp 14,"" said in a statement on his website over the weekend that Shin had changed ""key parts of his story."" ""On Friday, Jan. 16, I learned that Shin Dong-hyuk, the North Korean prison camp survivor who is the subject of 'Escape from Camp 14,' had told friends an account of his life that differed substantially from my book,"" Harden said. ""I contacted Shin, pressing him to detail the changes and explain why he had misled me."" Harden declined to provide additional details to CNN, but published a lengthy explanation on his website. A Washington Post story based on information Harden said he had provided to the newspaper said ""the most horrific details"" of Shin's story ""still stand,"" but some of the times and places of the events in his accounts were wrong. ""From a human rights perspective, he was still brutally tortured, but he moved things around,"" Harden told the Post, where he worked as a reporter for 28 years. Shin did not immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment. In a post on his Facebook page, he doesn't go into details about the purported discrepancies, but he includes a link to the Post's story and apologizes to his supporters. ""This particular past of mine that I so badly wanted to cover up can no longer be hidden, nor do I want it to be,"" he says. ""To those who have supported me, trusted me and believed in me all this time, I am so very grateful and at the same time so very sorry to each and every single one of you."" Inconsistencies highlighted . Shin ""significantly revised details of his early life,"" said Harden in a statement. The inaccuracies include the following: . • In the book, in his United Nations testimony and in interviews with media including CNN, Shin has detailed torture and abuse he claimed occurred in a notorious prison known as Camp 14. Shin told Harden on Friday that he'd actually been transferred with his mother and brother to a less restrictive prison camp, Camp 18, when he was six years old. It was there, not at Camp 14, where Shin now says he witnessed authorities execute his mother and brother. • Shin had previously said that he had lived his entire life in Camp 14 before escaping in 2005. He now says he escaped from Camp 18 twice before -- in 1999 and 2001, wrote Harden in his statement. During his second escape attempt from Camp 18, he was caught in China and repatriated to North Korea. First, he was sent to Camp 18 and later transferred to Camp 14 for torture and punishment, wrote Harden. • Shin now says he was 20 years old when he was tortured as a punishment for escaping, wrote Harden. His original account indicated that he was tortured when he was 13 for plotting to escape. Shin had been saying that he was tortured when he was a teenager since his arrival to South Korea in 2006. • Shin had described in the book that his finger was chopped off by an angry guard after he dropped a sewing machine in Camp 14. Now, Shin told Harden that his finger was mangled as a guard pulled out his fingernails as punishment for escaping. ""When I agreed to share my experience for the book, I found it was too painful to think about some of the things that happened,"" Shin told Harden. ""So I made a compromise in my mind. I altered some details that I thought wouldn't matter. I didn't want to tell exactly what happened in order not to relive these painful moments all over again."" Shin told Harden that he thought that dates, places and circumstances were not all that significant, according to the author's statement. Challenges with North Korea accounts . Accounts from North Korean defectors are often difficult to confirm, with lack of documents and the regime's general secrecy. Harden stated that he was working with the publisher to amend the book. It's unclear what action the book's publisher will take in response to the discrepancies in Shin's story. ""Viking, the publisher of ""Escape From Camp 14"" by Blaine Harden, has been apprised that there were some inaccuracies in the story Shin Dong-hyuk, the subject of the book, told the author,"" Penguin Books spokeswoman Louise Braverman said in a written statement Sunday. ""We are working with the author on an accurate understanding of the facts. North Korea has repeatedly denied Shin's claims and described testimony before a United Nations commission by him and others as ""slander"" put forward by ""human scum."" In a video posted last year on a website that carries pro-Pyongyang propaganda, Shin's father denied that his son was ever in a prison camp. Shin said in response that his father had been taken hostage and was being used in a campaign to discredit him. Human rights activists argue that changes in Shin's account do not ultimately affect his testimony, saying they still believe he was tortured and that his story highlights the horror of prison camps. The New York Times reported Sunday that Shin said he had held back about revealing inaccuracies in his story out of concerns that it could hurt his advocacy work. ""I dithered because friends feared the damage my coming out might do to the movement for North Korean human rights,"" he said, according to the Times. In his Facebook post, Shin said he was not sure if he would be able to continue his efforts to end political prison camps in North Korea. ""But instead of me, you can all still fight,"" he said. ""I still have faith in you."" CNN's Carma Hassan, Brian Walker, Paula Hancocks and KJ Kwon contributed to this report.","Shin Dong-hyuk has changed ""key parts of his story,"" the author of a book about him says .

"A charge of making a false bomb threat has been dropped against a man who carried a backpack containing a rice cooker near a crowd marking the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings in April, prosecutors said Wednesday. Investigators dropped the charge because they say the suspect, Kevin Edson, 25, did not communicate an ""overt threat that an incendiary device would be detonated,"" Jake Wark, a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney, told CNN. Edson was arrested after carrying the backpack with a rice cooker near the finish line on Boylston Street in Boston while survivors of the 2013 bombing were commemorating its anniversary on April 15. In the 2013 attack, two pressure-cooker bombs exploded, killing three people and wounding at least 264 others. A barefoot Edson, carrying a backpack and wearing black clothes with a veil and hat covering his face, screamed and yelled near the end of the anniversary event on Boylston Street, drawing officers' attention, police said. Wark said prosecutors decided to drop the charge after reviewing statements Edson made at the scene as well as video shot by onlookers. Edson still faces charges of disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, disturbing a public assembly and possession or use of a hoax device. His next court date is scheduled for August 27. The charge of making a false bomb threat carried the most severe sentence upon conviction -- up to 20 years in prison. Possession or use of a hoax device carries a maximum sentence of five years, Wark said. A judge in April set bail at $100,000 for Edson. The judge also ordered Edson, also known as Kayvon Edson, to be seen at a state hospital that evaluates defendants' sanity after a mental health professional told the judge that Edson has a history of psychiatric disturbances. Defense attorney Shannon Lopez did not immediately return calls seeking comment. How can you keep 26.2 miles safe?","Kevin Edson, 25, was charged with making a false bomb threat and other offenses .

"(CNN)Miss Lebanon Saly Greige is distancing herself from a photo of her and Miss Israel Doron Matalon that's causing an online uproar. The picture appeared on Matalon's Instagram feed on January 11. It shows Matalon smiling with Greige, Miss Slovenia and Miss Japan in Miami, where the Miss Universe pageant will take place on Sunday. ""Good morning from us!"" reads the caption. The image ignited a wide-ranging debate in the comments of the picture about the ongoing conflict between Israel and much of the Arab world. Officially, Israel and Lebanon are still at war, even though there have been no large-scale hostilities on the border since 2006. Travel between them by citizens of the two countries is prohibited. The Miss Universe Organization defended the picture, saying it was ""unfortunate"" that the picture has been perceived in a negative light. ""At an event with one of our charitable partners, Miss Universe Lebanon and Miss Universe Israel innocently ended up in an impromptu photo together, which was then posted on Instagram,"" the organization said in a statement to CNN. ""It is unfortunate to know a photo of four smiling women from different parts of the world, working together at an event, could be misconstrued as anything other than what it is, a celebration of universal friendship, which the Miss Universe pageant is all about."" Greige addressed the controversy on Saturday on social media, sharing what she called ""the truth behind the photo."" She also posted the same photo on her Instagram account with Miss Israel cropped out. From the start of pageant preparations, Greige said, she was ""very cautious to avoid being in any photo or communication with Miss Israel."" As she explains it, she was posing for a photo with Miss Japan and Miss Slovenia when ""suddenly Miss Israel jumped in, took a selfie, and put it on her social media,"" she said. Matalon weighed in Sunday after a website posted an article with the headline ""Miss Lebanon in Trouble."" She took a screenshot of the article and captioned it, ""It doesn't surprise me, but it still makes me sad,"" and posted it on her social media accounts. ""Too bad you can not put the hostility out of the game, only for three weeks of an experience of a lifetime that we can meet girls from around the world and also from the neighboring country."" Comments on her original photo echoed the sentiment. ""As a Lebanese, I really don't see anything wrong with this picture. It's time we promote peace over violence as the latter has gotten us no where. And if you really wanna discuss politics, it surely shouldn't be under the picture of 4 beautiful ladies who have nothing to do with your b******t. Good luck ladies!"" It's not the first time beauty pageants have been caught up in political controversy. According to multiple news reports, former Miss Lebanon Christina Sawaya pulled out of Miss Universe 2002 because she did not want to share the stage with Miss Israel amid tensions in the Middle East. ""The Miss Universe pageant has always been a celebration of different cultures, welcoming women from all around the globe. It provides an opportunity for the participants to see just how much they have in common,"" the organization said. ""With 88 women from around the world coming together for the Miss Universe pageant, new friendships are forged and we hope that these relationships can make inroads for change in the future.""","Miss Universe Organization calls controversy ""unfortunate""

"Indulgent resorts. Beautiful everything. Bora Bora is called paradise for a reason. And visitors return home with the exact photos of the island's towering Mount Pahia and Mount Otemanu, the thatched roofs of over-water bungalows and a magenta sunset over the sparkling ocean. Don't do it! There's a lot more to French Polynesia. The country is made up of 118 islands and atolls covering a stretch of ocean roughly the size of Europe. The culture extends far beyond seashell necklaces, tiki souvenirs and Monoi oil suntans. After flying into Tahiti's main airport, there's a network of islands reachable by plane or boat. This is where some of the best of French Polynesia's ocean adventures, cultural exploration, and, yes, romance, begins. More: 10 islands for every type of traveler . 1. Taha'a . Part of the Society Islands, the island of Taha'a is the premier place for Polynesian exports, including perfect black pearls and vanilla, grown on lush plantations. Chefs at top restaurants around the world specifically order Taha'a's fragrant vanilla beans. In Taha'a, it's worth going five-star. Le Taha'a Island Resort & Spa has restaurants and lounges built into trees, as well as 48 over-water bungalows atop a translucent lagoon. With a knowledgeable staff, you get resort-quality service without pretense. Le Taha'a Island Resort & Spa, Taha'a; +689 507601; from $708 for couples . 2. Rangiroa .

Divers around Rangiroa can spot tiger and hammerhead sharks, as well as dolphins, green turtles and eagle rays beyond the reef. Rangiroa is the hub of French Polynesia's wine industry. Vines grow along the lagoon next to coconut groves and grapes are brought to the local winery by boat. Raira Lagon, Avatoru, Rangiroa; +689 931230; from $165 per person . 3. Fatu Hiva . The word tattoo originated in Polynesia, and the region's best artists come from Fatu Hiva. Captain James Cook brought the Polynesian art form to the West after he and other explorers were influenced by the tattoos they saw in the Marquesas, a group of volcanic islands in French Polynesia and one of the five administrative divisions in the archipelago. You can still see local tribes with head-to-toe tattoos on Fatu Hiva. The art form, which tells the mythology of the South Pacific islands, is experiencing a resurgence there today. Fatu Hiva also offers gorgeous wilderness typical of the Marquesas. Trekking through the lush but hot jungles of the islands and narrow valleys isn't for the inexperienced, but it's worth the journey. Pension Chez Lionel serves a tasty local meal of plantains, goat meat and poe (fruit pudding). Chez Lionel, Fatu Hiva; +689 928184; from $48 a night . More: Belize: 7 of its most stunning islands . 4. Moorea . In recent years Moorea has been gaining on Bora Bora as the area's best honeymoon location. Many argue it rivals Bora Bora for natural splendor. It has low mountains rising above wide meadows of grass and ferns, fields growing coffee, pineapple and sugarcane, and villages encircled by gardens of bright hibiscus. It's a 30-minute catamaran ride from Tahiti. The Intercontinental Moorea has its own dolphin center for an up-close swimming experience, as well as singular amenities like room service by canoe and a spa flower bath experience. Intercontinental Resort and Spa Moorea, Moorea; +689 551919;  from $262 . 5. Rurutu . Better known as the Island of Whales, Rurutu is encircled by tall cliffs of ancient coral. This ring attracts mating humpback whales every year from July to August. Rurutu is worth visiting year round for the unique coral snorkeling experience, white sand beaches and incredible biking on the nearly car-free island. Manotel, Moeral, Rurutu; +689 930225; from $66 . 6. Hiva Oa . The Marquesas bring an authentic Polynesian experience to the island experience, as opposed to say, a honeymoon resort so big you need a golf cart to get around. This mysterious set of islands remains mostly untouched by modern tourism, with raw beauty that influenced Herman Melville and Robert Louis Stevenson. Singer Jacques Brel and painter Paul Gauguin spent their last days on the island of Hiva Oa, famous for its untamed landscapes, as well as archaeological wonders like giant stone tiki dotting the island, in addition to a proud local culture welcoming of visitors. The Paul Gauguin Cultural Centre pays tribute to his philosophy of ""escaping to reach art,"" and features a replica of his own Maison du Jounir (House of Pleasure). The Paul Gauguin Cultural Centre, Atuona, Hiva Oa; +689 927897 . 7. Nuku Hiva . Nuku Hiva is best suited for adventurous types who'd rather forgo the sun lounger and spend their vacation hiking through jungles or horseback riding across the island's desolate roads. Nuku Hiva is filled with natural wonders from volcanic cliffs to thousand-foot waterfalls, with water that evaporates before it touches the ground. The island is a key spot for archaeological sites, with Taipivai Valley housing several temples and large tiki, and the village of Hatiheu offering walking tours of petroglyphs and ruins. Pension Koku'u, Taiohae, Nuku Hiva; +689 920774; from $57 a night for bed and breakfast . More: Go barefoot or go home: 15 best islands you've never heard of . 8. Huahine . Huahine is good for exploration by canoe or glass-bottom boat. The island's crisp waves attract surfers year round. Huahine also features the world's longest and largest open-ocean canoe race. The island's lush vegetation includes giant bananas and melons. Lively bike tours will take you straight through fragrant vanilla plantations. Lakeside villas atop lily pads and palm trees at the Maitai Lapita Village provide a serene alternative to the typical ocean bungalow. Maitai Lapita Village Huahine, Huahine; +689 688080; bungalows from $268 . 9. Manihi . Another large coral atoll, Manihi offers a true castaway vacation, where few tourists venture. If you don't mind the occasional power outage and lack of imported food, you'll love this place. The airport is a simple straw hut, with an airstrip that doubles as the site of the best stargazing in the area. Manihi's salty waters provide the perfect environment for growing pearls. French Polynesia's first pearl farm was started here in 1968. But pearls are best bought back to Tahiti. The pearl farm prices are surprisingly inflated. Nanihi Paradise, Manihi; +689 933040; rates start at $121 . 10. Maupiti . At the far west of the Society Islands, Maupiti is a small volcanic island surrounded by a coral atoll. With its own high peaks, Maupiti is like a mini Bora Bora, without all the glitz. Its five islets seem created for boat rides and beach-side picnics. Mount Teurufaaitu is the highest point on the island, with incredible views of Raiatea, Bora Bora and Taha'a. As the oldest of the Society Islands, Maupiti is covered with archeological remains dating to 850 AD. Incredible turtle petroglyphs tell the story of the island's birth. You'll only find bed and breakfasts here, as locals actively campaign to keep away big resorts. Le Kuriri, Maupiti; +689 678223; from $138 per person . 11. Tetiaroa . After scouting locations for his film ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" in 1960, Marlon Brando fell in love with the French Polynesian lifestyle, a paradise he described as ""chiffon in the wind."" He bought the island of Tetiaroa, a previous vacation spot for Tahitian royalty. After years of planning, the Brando Resort is finally opening in July 2014, to be powered by renewable resources such as coconut fuel, solar power and deep-ocean water cooling. Focusing on private luxury, each of the 35 villas on the island offers its own plunge pool, terrace and coconut tree grove, all next to a private beach. Guests can cruise the lagoons by paddle boarding, book a traditional beauty ritual at the Queen's Spa or learn about Tetiaroa's royal history at the Culture Lounge. The Brando, Tetiaroa Private Island; info@thebrando.com; reservations open in early 2014 . More: Which Greek island should you go to? 12. Mangareva . At the center of the Gambier Islands, the islands at the end of the world, more than a thousand miles southeast of Tahiti, sits Mangareva. A hub of Catholic missionaries in the 19th century, its village of Rikitea is home to the neo-Gothic 1848 St. Michael's Cathedral, constructed of fired limestone and inlaid with mother of pearl. The village center is filled with eerie stone ruins from the era, including watchtowers, a triumphal arch and a former prison. The hike up Mount Duff through high grass and pine forest offers the best panoramic views of the island. Not many tourists make it out to Mangareva -- Air Tahiti operates flights only once a week, guaranteeing a quiet getaway. The island is serviced by a handful of modest and hospitable pensions. Pension Bianca & Benoit, Rikitea, Mangareva; +690 978376; from $95 a night per couple with breakfast . 13. Fakarava . With an enormously fun name, Fakarava is known for its diverse ecosystem, marked by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve to preserve rare species. With only about 400 people living on the island, its atolls are virtually untouched, making it great for diving. Over-water bungalows are banned to protect the delicate coral in the area. While other pearl farms in Tahiti are often tourist traps, Fakarava offers a genuine exploration of the pearl trade. Motu Aito Paradise, Tuamotu, Fakarava; +689 41 29 00; from $165 per person for full board . 14. Raiatea . Ancient legends are still a daily part of Raiatea, Tahiti's religious and cultural capital a thousand years ago.

Here you can learn about how South Pacific civilization took shape. Today, Raiatea's vast harbor serves as the starting point for private boat tours of the surrounding islands or deep-sea fishing tours. Opoa Beach Hotel, Taputapuatea, Raiatea; +689 600510; from $265 per couple . 15. Tikehau . Tikehau, an oval-shaped island covered in pink sand and surrounded by rich waters, has the best beaches in French Polynesia. Jacques Cousteau's research group declared it the most fish-abundant atoll in Polynesia, which makes for incredible snorkeling just a few feet into the water. There are typical over-water bungalows or, for something different, Tikehau Ninamu Resort, a one of a kind property set in a forest of bamboo containing birds of paradise.

"Sebastian Vettel's run of four successive victories ended on Sunday, but the German's remarkable drive in Abu Dhabi kept him in pole position to become Formula One's youngest triple world champion. After being disqualified from Saturday's qualifying due to a technical infringement, the Red Bull star was allowed to start from the pit lane -- but still managed to finish third after one of the most chaotic races this season. His heroic showing overshadowed Kimi Raikkonen's first victory since 2009, and ended the Finn's slim hopes of a second world title ahead of the final two races. Vettel's lead was cut by three points to 10 as main rival Fernando Alonso finished second for Ferrari, and the Spaniard said he was happy after improving from sixth on the starting grid. Latest F1 standings . ""We were not super competitive this weekend. We had to fight through the laps, then we had a good strategy that gave us a chance for the victory, but second was the maximum,"" Alonso said. The top three benefited by the withdrawal of Lewis Hamilton, who seemed set for his first victory since Monza in September as he raced clear. However, the 2008 world champion suffered yet another mechanical problem as his McLaren developed fuel pressure problems -- it was the second time in five races the Englishman has retired while leading. ""I'm gutted. I feel certain we could have won,"" said Hamilton, who will switch to the Mercedes team next year. ""I was just entering a corner and the car just died on me. I was cruising and still pulling away when I had my problem."" Vettel's hopes seemed bleak early in the race after he twice made contact with other cars and suffered minor damage -- but that was nothing compared to the scrapes in which his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber was involved. The safety car was called out twice, which worked in Vettel's favor, and Webber failed to finish after tangles with Williams' Pastor Maldonado and Ferrari's Felipe Massa and then a terminal shunt from Sauber's Sergio Perez which also took out Lotus' Romain Grosjean. ""The second safety car helped, then I had a nice fight with Jenson (Button). It was a thrilling grand prix, up and down all the time,"" said Vettel, who won in Abu Dhabi in 2009-10 but retired last year with his second world title already in the bag. ""There are still two races to go. We saw how things can change yesterday. There was a chance we could screw it up, but we didn't do that."" Webber's DNF meant that Red Bull will have to wait another race before clinching a third successive manufacturers' title -- holding a lead of 82 points over Ferrari with 86 still on offer. Jenson Button helped McLaren stay third as he finished fourth ahead of Maldonado, while Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi improved his hopes of another season at Sauber by placing sixth. Massa, who has had his Ferrari contract extended by another year, was seventh ahead of Bruno Senna -- who gave Williams a second driver in the top 10 despite an early collision with Sauber-bound Nico Hulkenberg. Force India's Paul di Resta was ninth after his teammate Hulkenberg's early exit while Toro Rosso's Daniel Ricciardo -- who earned Vettel's anger after causing him front-wing damage -- was 10th. Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, delivered Lotus' first victory this season as he continued a consistent return to F1 that has put him third in the overall standings -- but now 57 points behind Vettel with only 50 points available. ""It's been a hard season, not an easy time, but hopefully this gives us more belief,"" said Raikkonen, who will stay at Lotus for the second year of his contract. ""I hope this can turn the tables and give us many more wins, if not this year then for next year.""","Kimi Raikkonen wins Abu Dhabi Grand Prix but Sebastian Vettel retains overall lead .

"TLC's reality show ""19 Kids and Counting"" has tons of fans, but more than 80,000 can't be counted in that number. That's the amount who have signed a Change.org petition to have the show canceled in light of what the petition calls the Duggar family's anti-LGBT stance. According to the petition, Michelle Duggar's voice can be heard on a recorded call from this past summer urging the citizens of Fayetteville, Arkansas, to vote to repeal a law that forbids business owners and landlords from evicting and firing people based on gender identity. ""The Fayetteville City Council is voting on an ordinance this Tuesday night that would allow men -- yes I said men -- to use women's and girls' restrooms, locker rooms, showers, sleeping areas and other areas that are designated for females only,"" the petition reports Duggar as saying on the robocall. ""I don't believe the citizens of Fayetteville would want males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female to have a legal right to enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls."" The petition says Duggar's words ""reek of ignorance and fear mongering."" ""Just because someone is transgendered doesn't mean they are a child predator or a rapist,"" the petition says. ""The claim that this ordinance would provide predators with access to women's restrooms in order to assault or leer at girls or women is nothing more than fear-mongering and spreading ignorance and hatred."" The Duggars are known for being devout Christians who don't believe in practicing birth control and whose children follow courtship rules that include no kissing until their wedding day. The petition also says that the Duggars' oldest son, Josh, has taken a job with the Family Research Center, which the petition says ""is such a hate-filled, anti-gay organization that the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2010 labeled it a 'hate group' for its 'dissemination of false and demonizing propaganda about gays and lesbians.' "" The movement comes on the heels of controversy about a recent posting on the Duggars' ""official"" Facebook page. After their newly married daughter Jessa was criticized for sharing an Instagram photo of herself kissing her husband Ben Seewald, Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar posted an image of themselves kissing and challenging others to do the same. John Becker, who blogs about LGBT issues at The Bilerico Project, wrote that pictures of same-sex couples were deleted.

"(CNN) -- When former Brazil international captain Cafu is asked why he became a professional footballer, he gives a simple reply. ""I was born in 1970,"" he says. That may seem like a slightly abstract answer to those unfamiliar with South America's most populous nation. To those from the land of sun, samba and the beautiful game, however, it makes perfect historical sense. That was the year of the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, where Pele, Jairzinho, Rivelino, Carlos Alberto and Co. dazzled an international audience with a style of football seldom seen since. There are even some who maintain this Brazil side remains the greatest team in the history of the sport. ""That says it all about how I got into football,"" Cafu told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I was born during World Cup time and from there it was just about giving sequence to what I really enjoyed and that was playing football."" A rampaging right-sided defender with seemingly endless stamina, Cafu played in four World Cups, captaining Brazil to football's biggest prize in 2002 and starring in two others -- USA 1994, where Brazil won and France 1998 where they lost 3-0 to the hosts in the final. He also became the most capped Brazilian player of all time (winning 148 caps) whilst picking up 21 trophies in a glittering career at club level in Brazil, Italy and Spain. Former Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, even once jokingly queried if Cafu had two hearts such was his ability to keep on running without getting tired -- even towards the end of his career. ""Nowadays, everyone says that I should have continued to play,"" Cafu said when asked on why he retired when he seemingly still had much gas left in the tank. ""But I thought that was the moment to stop playing ... (at) 38 years old."" ""I think I had already given my contribution to football, not just nationally but internationally as well,"" he added. Escape from poverty . To be fair to Marcos Evangelista de Moraes (Cafu's full name), it was a long journey. One that stretched fully 18 years in total. It all began in Sao Paulo. Cafu was born in the city's impoverished Jardim Irene district, playing football in the streets and learning the tough lessons that would later shape his outlook on life. He now runs a charity foundation in his old neighborhood and hopes to encourage the young people there to dream big. ""Everything I have, I owe to Jardim Irene,"" he said. ""I want the children to see me there, that I'm giving them attention, so that they can have a good role model. What our children are missing today are good role models."" The young Cafu had trials at a host of Brazilian sides in the late 1980s before eventually being accepted by hometown club, Sao Paulo. Originally a right-sided midfielder, Cafu was converted into his more familiar right back position by inspirational Sao Paulo coach Tele Santana. He excelled in this position and helped the Tricolor claim back to back Copa Libertadores (South America's premier club cup competition) crowns in 1992 and 1993. A transfer to Real Zaragoza in Spain provided Cafu's first foreign sojourn in the 1994-95 season before he returned to Brazil one year later, first with Juventude and then Palmeiras. After a season at Palmeiras, an offer came from Roma to move back to Europe. Cafu would spend six seasons in the Italian capital where he helped the Giallorossi win only their third ever Serie A title and their first in 18 years. In 2003, Cafu would make the final move of his career as he was transferred to AC Milan. Here, he would win Serie A once more as well as the European Champions League and World Club Cup titles. With so much success, picking out a favorite club moment is no easy task. ""In Sao Paulo, I won everything. Milan, I won everything. Roma, I was league champion. Palmeiras, I was Paulista (Brazilian league) champion."" ""All the titles have been memorable. I don't have one that was more memorable or less memorable. They are all important titles with various teams."" Biggest prize . The World Cup is a different story, however. ""Without a doubt, winning the World Cup as a professional athlete is the highest prize in football. It's the peak, the maximum that you can reach."" This was a footballing zenith he reached twice. The first was at the Pasadena Rose Bowl at the final of USA 94 where Brazil faced off against Italy in the sweltering California heat. Cafu started the game on the substitute's bench although he was required to come on for the injured Jorginho after just 21 minutes. ""Its an unexplainable feeling,"" he said of having to come into the game so early and unexpectedly. ""When (coach, Carlos Alberto) Parreira looked at the bench and said I was going to come in, there was a lot of emotion."" ""(The other players) were already warmed up, everyone was at a fast pace ... and you get on the pitch in that rhythm that looks like you are slower when in comparison to your opponents."" He needn't have been so concerned. A tense, goalless encounter went to penalties with Brazil triumphing after Italy's Franco Baresi, Daniele Massaro and Roberto Baggio missed from the spot. The second World Cup triumph was even more satisfying. As captain, Cafu led an unfancied Brazil who had struggled through qualifying all the way to the final against Germany at the Yokohama Stadium in Tokyo. Two goals from an inspired Ronaldo settled the tie in Brazil's favor, securing a record fifth World Cup crown for the country. In an iconic moment, Cafu climbed atop the podium high above his team mates to accept the trophy. ""It was fantastic. Climbing and getting the cup up in the air the way we did ... maybe that made is what made it so beautiful,"" Cafu said recalling the moment. ""I think that Brazil deserved at that moment to be in the highest place of the stadium."" This exalted position is a place he hopes to see his younger compatriots occupy later this summer as the World Cup comes to Brazil for the first time since 1950 and South America for the first time since 1978. With star players like Neymar, Oscar and Hulk, as well as home advantage, Brazil are rightly considered among the leading contenders. Doubts have been raised, however, about the country's preparation for the tournament as well as whether the economic benefits will be felt by all in Brazilian society. ""The infrastructures are being built, the stadium is being built (and) the Brazilian people's faith is helping a lot,"" Cafu said. ""For us it is going to be a very historic and fantastic moment. ""I have no doubt whatsoever that Brazil will do a terrific World Cup and they will be (six time) world champions,"" he added. The likes of Argentina, Germany, Spain, Holland and Italy will no doubt have something to say about that. If the hosts can channel the belief and stamina of their former captain, however, there might be little the others can do about it. See also: From Super Eagle to African Pioneer .

"The questions are many. But the first has to be, how in the world did a 16-year-old boy survive a five-hour flight in below freezing cold weather at oxygen-depleted heights without dying or falling out of the wheel well of a huge jumbo jet? Another has to be, how does a 16-year-old even sneak on to an airport and a plane to begin with? Authorities likely were trying to find the answers to some of their questions Monday. The boy remained in the custody of child welfare services workers in Hawaii. But the FBI says they have no more need to interview the boy as he is no threat. Apparently he's just a runaway who popped out of the wheel well of Hawaii Airlines Flight 45 on Sunday to the amazement of the ground crew at the Kahului Airport on the island of Maui -- and triggering a host of questions. How did he survive the flight? As unlikely as it sounds, officials believe the boy rode in a tiny, cramped compartment for almost five hours, at altitudes that reached 38,000 feet, without oxygen and in subzero temperatures. ""It sounds really incredible,"" said aviation expert Jeff Wise. ""Being in a wheel well is like all of a sudden being on top of Mount Everest."" Between the oxygen depletion and the cold, life expectancy ""is measured in minutes,"" Wise said. But some people have survived. Since 1947, 105 people are known to have attempted to fly inside wheel wells on 94 flights worldwide, the Federal Aviation Administration's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute says. Of those, 25 made it through, including a 9-year-old child -- a survival rate of 24%. One of the flights went as high as 39,000 feet. Two others were at 38,000 feet. The conditions at high altitudes can put stowaways in a virtual ""hibernative"" state, the FAA said. Someone could slip into unconsciousness so that the body cools and ""the central nervous system is preserved,"" said CNN aviation expert Michael Kay. Also, he said, ""there could be a situation where inside the bay is warmer than the external air temperature and you wouldn't get the instantaneous freezing of the skin."" Still, ""for somebody to survive multiple hours with that lack of oxygen and that cold is just miraculous,"" airline analyst Peter Forman told CNN affiliate KHON in Honolulu. The boy's survival is ""dumb luck mostly,"" says Dr. Kenneth Stahl, trauma surgeon at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital. The temperature outside the airplane could have been as low as 75 or 80 degrees below zero, said Stahl, who is also a pilot. ""Those are astronomically low temperatures to survive."" The boy was likely so cold that ""he was essentially in a state of suspended animation,"" Stahl said. Being young likely worked in his favor, too. ""No adult would have survived that,"" Stahl added. The boy could face permanent brain damage from the experience, in fact, it's ""more likely than not,"" Stahl said. He could face neurological issues, memory problems or a lower IQ. When the ground crew at Kahului Airport noticed the boy, he was wandering the tarmac, dazed and confused. The teen also could have frostbite or a kidney injury because when the body freezes, particles of muscle enter the blood stream and damage the kidneys, Stahl said. Teen stowaway raises questions about airport security . How did he get there? The 16-year-old apparently hitched a ride from San Jose, California, to Maui in the landing-gear wheel well of a Boeing 767, Hawaiian Airlines said. The boy told authorities he was from Santa Clara, California, and ran away from home Sunday morning, said FBI Special Agent Tom Simon. He didn't have an ID and was carrying only a comb. He hopped an airport fence, ran to the plane and climbed on, the FBI said. ""It appears that this teenager scaled a section of our perimeter,"" Mineta San Jose International Airport spokeswoman Rosemary Barnes told CNN. The boy ""was able to proceed onto our ramp under cover of darkness and enter the wheel well of an aircraft."" Officials for the city of San Jose, which operates the airport, are not planning any legal action, Barnes said Monday. Once they were confident that the teen did not present a threat, the FBI dropped out of the investigation. The boy is in the custody of child welfare services workers in Hawaii,  said Kayla Rosenfeld, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Human Services. She said Monday afternoon that officials have notified the boy's family that he is safe. How did no one notice him? Surveillance camera footage shows the boy hopping the fence at the San Jose airport, the FBI said. There's also camera footage of him walking across the ramp in San Jose toward the Hawaiian aircraft, the airport said. Video ""is under review by federal and local law enforcement officials here,"" Barnes said. ""And we'll continue to review that to determine where, in fact, the teenager was able to scale the fence line."" The boy told investigators he crawled into the wheel well of the plane and lost consciousness when the plane took off. An hour after the plane landed at Kahului Airport, the boy regained consciousness and emerged to a ""dumbfounded"" ground crew, the FBI's Simon said. The Maui airport has video of him crawling out of the left main gear area. ""It makes no sense to me,"" Simon said. Mavin Moniz, the Maui District airport manager, added that a worker saw the boy come out of the wheel well and walk toward the front of the aircraft. ""Clearly there's a big security breach here, which in the post 9/11 world order is a concern,"" said Kay. To get past all sorts of people apparently unnoticed is ""a physical feat,"" he said. 5 stowaway attempts that didn't end tragically . How did he not get crushed or fall? It's not hard at all"" to climb inside the wheel well, said Jose Wolfman Guillen, a ground operations coordinator at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. ""You can grab onto the struts and landing gear assembly kind of like a ladder, and you just jump on the tire and climb into the wheel well."" Inside, there's not much room -- even less than in the trunk of a car, Guillen said. A stowaway would need to guess ""where the tire is going to fold in when it closes after takeoff. There's a high risk of getting crushed once the gear starts going in."" During the flight, ""the interior guts of the aircraft, they're pretty exposed inside the wheel well, so there's a lot of stuff you can hold on to,"" Guillen adds. ""It's just a matter of holding on to it for the duration of the flight and maintaining your grip when the gear opens up and not falling out. If you fell out, you could get horribly mangled or dragged on the runway."" In February, crews at Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington found the body of a man inside the landing-gear wheel well of an Airbus A340 operated by South African Airways. In 2010, a 16-year-old boy died after he fell out of the wheel well of a US Airways flight that was landing at Boston's Logan International Airport. The most recent known case of someone surviving was on a short domestic flight in Nigeria. A 15-year-old boy snuck into the wheel well of a flight from Benin City to Lagos -- thinking it was a flight to the United States, according to an FAA report. The ride lasted only 35 minutes, and the plane likely went no higher than 25,000 feet. The FAA and Transportation Security Administration have studied stowaway incidents to augment security. Many incidents involve people desperately trying to escape their countries. ""No system is 100%,"" said San Jose airport spokeswoman Barnes. Boy, 11, hops plane to Rome without ticket or passport .

"(CNN)Tough, strong and noble; these are the sorts of qualities one would expect from a national symbol. The fabled Karabakh horse is a rare and beautiful animal that is of great importance to Azerbaijanis. But the country's national animal that can be found everywhere from its stories to its postage stamps is faced with extinction. In the thickly forested foothills of Sheki, a small city 300km (187 miles) from the capital Baku, is one of world's largest and purest Karabakh herds. Their owner, Yashar Guluzade, has been restoring the breed for over a decade in this unspoilt mountainous region. He says that conflict and a difficult economic situation have led to their decline. ""At the beginning of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict the horses were continually transferred from one place to another and this was one of the reasons for the sharp reduction of stock as the movement of pregnant mares led to miscarriages,"" he explained. Guluzade says that the places the horses were taken did not have the correct conditions and pastures to support them and it was as if the country had forgotten about them. The government has now stepped in to try and protect the breed. Azerbaijan's Ministry of Agriculture has drawn up a number of horse breeding programs and the law states the animal cannot be exported for sale. The ministry says it may consider selling the horses in the future to raise money for their upkeep but for now the focus is on breeding and protection. Khandan Rajabli, the managing director of the ministry's breeding division told CNN that these programs include improving veterinary services, training and scientific studies on the horses' DNA. ""Instituting a system of identification like passports to track the breed has been established"" he said. Rajabli says that a German company is also assisting with gene research and establishing the horses genetic profiling so a system can be developed to confirm the breed in future. German horse breeder, Verena Scholian, is one of the experts that have been working with the Azerbaijani government, advising them on breeding programs and technical equipment. Scholian, who has spent decades researching the Karabakh's blood-line, says it's easy to see the horses appeal. ""I love handling them; they are calm, friendly and very sure footed,"" she said. Estimates on the number of Karabakh horses vary.  According to the Karabakh Foundation, there are less than 1,000, but Scholian believes there could be less than 10 mares that are one-half pure bred. The mountain-steppe racing horse is named after the geographical region where it was originally developed. The Karabakh horse is the result of cross-breeding and stands out with what's been described as its ""golden glow."" The horses are also known for their exceptional speed. The Karabakh foundation says that in 2004, a horse from the Agdam region set a world record; running 1,000 meters in 1 minute and 9 seconds. The foundation's chair, Dr. Adil Baguirov, originally from the Karabakh region, says the horse has always been important to Azerbaijani's. ""Azerbaijanis are Turkic people who until a few centuries ago enjoyed a semi-nomadic lifestyle, especially in the Karabakh region, which is lush with grass and has perfect pastures,"" he said. ""Even as late as the 19th century, a sizable portion of Azerbaijanis, particularly in the Karabakh region, lived in mountains in the summer and in lowlands in the winter,"" he continued. Baguirov explains that it was the horses ability to handle mountainous and rugged terrain that deemed them an essential part of life. These days Scholian says the horses are mainly used for racing and as a status symbol for the rich. Guluzade currently has 35 pure bred Karabakh horses on his farm.  He says he will continue to breed them because he is worried about their future. ""My strategy for breeding was built on the premise that each pure bred mare should leave behind one offspring, preferably a mare,"" he said. ""I will continue my work in this direction where others have been irresponsible in the past,"" he continued. The century-old breed is said to have incredible endurance and strength, qualities that Azerbaijani's hope will see the animals fight off extinction. ""The Karabakh horses are a symbol of national heritage and pride.  It's an ancient, national breed that is inseparable from our national identity,"" Rajabli said. Ludmilla Beckwith and Vladic Ravich contributed to this story .","The Karabakh horse is Azerbaijan's national animal .

"(CNN) -- Gone are the days of the grainy camera phone images with the resolution of a poor imitation Monet. Today's smartphone cameras are so advanced that mobile photography is becoming an art form in its own right, turning photo-sharing apps like Instagram into portable galleries for amateur photographers, and professionals like street style photographer Tommy Ton and chief official White House photographer Pete Souza. ""You have the dark room in your pocket,"" says Pierre Le Govic, the Paris-based founder of Out of the Phone, the world's first publishing house dedicated to mobile photography. This month, Out of the Phone follows its debut publication, last year's book of mobile photos from two-time Pulitzer Prize-nominated photographer Richard Koci Hernandez, with Out of the Phone: The Mobile Photo Book 2014, a diverse selection of 100 Instagram images taken by users from 25 countries. Democratizing photography . Before founding Out of the Phone in 2013, Le Govic ran a fine art photography printing company that counted Daido Moriyama and William Eggleston as clients. He first started following mobile photography on Instagram in 2011, and was surprised and impressed by the quality of work that hobbyists were creating. ""Now there are many well known photographers who use the platform, but at the very beginning, there were many people who didn't know so much about photography, and these were the kind of people that I wanted to showcase,"" he says. ""But on the other hand, it was also something confusing because there are too many images."" The desire to curate what he was seeing, coupled with a longtime ambition to create books, led him to give publishing a try. While Le Govic had preselected a number of established photographers to feature in this year's inaugural anthology (he's hoping it will become an annual publication), he also gave Instagram users the chance to put themselves up for consideration, using the hashtag #outofthephone to nominate their best works. He was astounded to receive over 20,000 submissions. What was he looking for in a successful entry? Technical skill was understandably important, but Le Govic says he also sought something less tangible. ""At the end, what is important is the story and the sensibility of the photographer ... It's a mix between a good story, a good composition,"" he says. ""Photography, for me, is a sort of fresh air, a way to look at things differently. So I'm looking for that sort of feeling when I look at pictures."" Preserving ""moments of grace"" Now that The Mobile Photo Book has been published, Le Govic is looking forward to promoting his concept and expanding. He's looking to start hiring in the New Year (so far, it's been a one-man operation), and solicit investors and partners. Several projects are set for release next year, including books from award-winning documentary photographer Benjamin Lowy, and other photographers he believes are using the medium to its fullest. ""Some images deserve to get to paper because it's a kind of memory,"" he says. ""If I can help to keep memory of interesting moments, some moments of grace perhaps...I think it's interesting to fix them on paper and to alert to people not to forget them.""

"(CNN) -- Entertainer Michael Jackson died after being taken to a hospital on Thursday having suffered cardiac arrest, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner's office. A Los Angeles fire official told CNN that paramedics arrived at Michael Jackson's home after a 911 call. Paramedics took Jackson, 50, from his west Los Angeles home Thursday afternoon to UCLA Medical Center, where a team of physicians attempted to resuscitate him for more than an hour, said brother Jermaine Jackson. He said the famed singer was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. PT. An autopsy is scheduled Friday, he said. Results are expected Friday afternoon, according to Lt. Fred Corral of the Los Angeles coroner's office, who also said Jackson was unresponsive when he arrived at the hospital. Fire Capt.

"(CNN)George Zimmerman -- acquitted by a Florida jury over the death of Trayvon Martin -- was arrested in Florida on suspicion of aggravated assault and domestic violence with a weapon, local authorities said. The 31-year-old Florida resident was arrested Friday by police in Lake Mary at about 10 p.m. and booked into the John E. Polk Correctional Facility, according to that facility's website. That facility, like its website, is run by the Seminole County Sheriff's Office. It all came about after Zimmerman allegedly threw a wine bottle at a girlfriend, his lawyer Don West told reporters. ""Whatever happened took place several days ago,"" said West. ""And, as far as I know, they have not been together for some time, certainly not since then."" Police first learned about it after coming ""in contact with the (alleged) victim at a traffic stop"" on Monday, Lake Mary police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett  said. When asked about the delay in making the arrest, Gillett said the arresting officer tried to reach Zimmerman on Monday and Tuesday, but couldn't, and was off-duty Wednesday and Thursday. It was the officer's decision not to pass off the case to another officer, Gillett said. The incident is the latest legal run-in for Zimmerman since his acquittal in July 2013 on a murder charge in the death of Martin, a 17-year-old African-American. In fact, it's his second arrest for alleged domestic violence against a girlfriend -- though Lake Mary police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett said this alleged ""victim is not the same (woman) as in 2013."" ""It's clear he hasn't been very lucky with the ladies the last few months,"" West said of his client. Judge bars contact, orders weapons surrendered . Zimmerman appeared Saturday morning before Judge John Galluzo, who decided to bar him from contacting the alleged victim or going into Volusia County. He was also told to surrender any weapons to a relative or third party, but not to stop drinking since the judge said ""there wasn't any allegation of abuse of alcohol in the arrest affidavit."" Appearing in court is not new for Zimmerman, who became a national figure in 2012 after spotting Martin in his Sanford, Florida, neighborhood. The two ended up having a confrontation that climaxed with Zimmerman fatally shooting the teenager, who was unarmed. That incident, and authorities' decision not to immediately charge Zimmerman, spurred large-scale protests. In April of that year, Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder, with an affidavit accusing him of profiling Martin and ignoring a police dispatcher's request that he wait for police. After a high-profile trial, a jury found Zimmerman not guilty. That made him a free man -- but did not end his issues with the law. No charge after other domestic violence claim . About two weeks after the verdict, he was pulled over for speeding in northern Texas. Much bigger troubles came in November 2013, when Zimmerman was taken into custody at his then-girlfriend's Apoka, Florida, home after the two allegedly had a heated fight. He was arrested then on aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief, accusations that he denied. He posted $9,000 bail days later. But after the girlfriend asked that the issue be dropped, State Attorney Phil Archer announced that prosecutors would not press charges. More recently, in September 2014, Lake Mary police said that a man claimed that Zimmerman threatened him during a road rage incident. ""I will ... kill you,"" Zimmerman allegedly said, according to police. ""Do you know who I am?"" He was not arrested and has not been charged. West said that his client -- who posted $5,000 bail later Saturday -- doesn't have a full-time job, implying he's had his struggles since the Martin acquittal. ""It's been a devastating experience that he's had that he's working through,"" the lawyer said. ""... I'm concerned, obviously, as we are here again this morning.""

"Spewing red hot lava 300 meters in the air, an erupting volcano in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is turning the war-torn African country into an unlikely tourist destination. Tourists have been visiting the Virunga National Park on overnight treks and in increasing numbers to witness the latest lava eruptions from the volcano, which have been flowing since November 6. Mount Nyamulagira is considered to be the most active volcano in the area and for $300 each, around 60 to 70 volcano fans have been traveling an hour from the eastern city of Goma to the start of the trek at the Virunga National Park. With the aid of the European Union, Virunga National Park has been a driver in boosting tourism to eastern Congo over the past few years. Tourism officials predict that visitor numbers at Virunga National Park will rise to nearly 4,000 this year -- up from 1,800 in 2010, while Africa's oldest national park is expected to raise over $1 million in revenue for the first time in its history, according to a report in the International Business Times. The Democratic Republic of Congo is home to eight national parks, five of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, as well as being home to many endangered species, making it ripe territory for eco-tourism. However statistics on the country, which has been embroiled in civil war since 1998, are grim reading. It is a place where women are systemically raped, children are forced to fight as soldiers and most people struggle to survive on less than $2 a day. But the volcano's proximity and its vivid colors are worth braving the rough terrain for, according to one of the first people to visit the area. ""We really wanted to go in,"" says Ethan Kinsey, a tour operator from Tanzania who was in one of the first overnight volcano treks. ""(National park wardens) had to assess the safety of it and then we hiked in immediately."" On the northern side of the volcano, participants can watch lava spew out of the Earth from a tented camping site 1.5 kilometers away, which has been deemed safe by a volcanologist. Kinsey says: ""Where you look across at the volcano, there is nothing between you and it except a few piles of rock. It is really quite dramatic. ""You really don't know what is happening underneath (the ground) -- it could just blow up. But it seemed like pretty regular explosions."" Kinsey traveled into the national park with two friends and recommends staying overnight. ""The colors are so much more vivid ... It really is beautiful. We slept with our tents open so we could see it, and the tents face the volcano so we could see the explosions in the night."" Orphaned gorillas find a safe haven . Kinsey says he felt very at ease while on the trek despite the warnings about the region. ""There are a lot of people walking around with guns, a lot of people walking around with AK-47s, carrying rocket launchers ... But obviously, if the national parks are confident that they can provide a safe experience then it's safe,"" he says. ""The rebel activity that is causing instability is not targeted at tourists. It is not really targeted at the rangers either. I felt safe."" He added: ""I think that there will be a lot of interest (in volcano trekking) so now I just have to spread it out and get it out there that we can do this."" The impoverished central African country also made its debut at the World Travel Market in London in September this year, signaling to the world that it means business when it comes to boosting tourism revenue. In its efforts to promote tourism, the DRC government, in conjunction with the Institut Congo pour la Conservation de la Nature (Congolese Wildlife Authority), has recently launched a tourism visa that can be obtained online through Virunga's website for $50. DRC borders Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda at the junction of the Rift Valley Lakes region, but despite the country's more varied biodiversity, Uganda and Rwanda generate more revenue from the gorilla tourism trade, because of the instability in the area according to analysts EuroMonitor. Many governments currently warn their citizens against traveling to the Democratic Republic of Congo due to extreme security risks as a result of continued military activity. However, GoCongo, a tourist operator in the area, describes the DRC as a place of adventure. The company wrote on their website: ""No one goes there to rest and sit in a chair for a couple of weeks. Congo is an experience and asks for active people ... If you really need (five star) lodges, whisky on the rocks and your 20-channels television, please go somewhere else."" National park experts are unsure how long the volcano will continue to erupt, spraying vibrant lava and rocks into the sky. The Virunga National Park, a World Heritage site has eight volcanoes that spread across the Virunga mountain range, but only two are currently active. The 7,900 hectare site is also home to critically endangered mountain gorillas. ""The area where the eruption is taking place is an area that has been affected by eruptions for around two-and-a half-years ... Our mountain gorillas don't live in that area. They are about 50 kilometers away so they are completely untouched,"" says Virunga National Park development officer Cai Tjeenk Willak said.","Virunga National Park in the DRC is inviting tourists on overnight treks to see an erupting volcano .

"Sporting only the most stylish designer labels, wearing only meticulously matched colors, the Congo's dandies are the very embodiment of sartorial elegance. Known as ""Sapeurs,"" these dapper dressers are a Congolese subculture devoted to the cult of style. In Brazzaville and Kinshasa -- the capitals of neighboring Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- they stand out among the widespread poverty, strutting the streets like walking works of art. ""It's the fetishization of fashion -- they are the worshippers of fashion, it's their god, it's powerful,"" says Didier Gondola, author of ""History of the Congo,"" who has extensively researched the Sapeurs. But for the Sapeurs -- who are almost always men -- it's not about what's in vogue, it's about style. The labels they covet most are those that evoke classic elegance. Suits by Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier and Armani are all in demand, as are Japanese labels Kenzo and Yamamoto, says Gondola. When it comes to shoes, exclusive French label Weston and British label Church's reign supreme. And imitations will not be tolerated. ""You can lose your reputation if you are wearing imitation,"" says Gondola. ""That's something blasphemous."" See also: Desert festival: Oasis for sounds of the Sahara . But these labels don't come cheap. Gondola, who was born in the Congo and teaches history at Indiana University in the United States, explains that Sapeurs aren't rich; they typically work menial jobs, and have been known to resort to shoplifting to feed their addiction to apparel. In Brazzaville, it's common for Sapeurs to rent or borrow clothes from fellow fops or requisition them from friends visiting from Europe. As the Congolese Diaspora has spread, so have the Sapeurs. They can now be found in European capitals including London, Brussels and Paris. Dixy Ndalla, 30, was born and raised in Brazzaville, but has lived in London since the age of 17. He's infatuated with the classic cuts worn by the British aristocracy and can spend £1,000 a month on new shirts and jackets. ""I am very passionate about clothing, I'm passionate about colors and suits,"" he says. ""In the winter it's anything to do with tweeds, in the summertime a nice blazer, a beautiful pair of jeans, a beautiful shirt. ""I especially love Hackett, one of the top designers in the UK ... Hackett suits start from around £600 and a bespoke made-to-measure will go out from £1,000 and upward."" Ndalla travels back to Brazzaville in the summer and takes pride in showing off his very British attire. ""In the summer holidays, everyone goes to show their outfits,"" he says. ""They all meet in one street or bars and they all show their colors or the label of their suits ... it's up to people to judge and appreciate who's dressed well."" Once dressed in their finery, Brazzaville's Sapeurs will often head to ""Le Main Bleu,"" a favorite bar, where they have informal contests. Each tries to out Sap each other with their combination of style, comportment and designer labels -- known as ""griffes."" But Ndalla doesn't consider himself a Sapeur, because he doesn't dress up to compete with others. For him, it's simply about taking pride in what you wear. ""People from Congo love to dress up -- it's something that's in my blood,"" he says. Although every Sapeur has their own unique style, certain looks are especially popular. Pastel-colored three-piece suits are a staple of the Sapeurs' fastidiously assembled ensembles. They are finished off with a tie, cravat or bow tie -- and the obligatory pocket square protruding from their immaculately tailored jackets. Cigars and pipes -- lit or unlit -- are de rigueur. Italian photographer Daniele Tamagni stumbled across the Sapeurs when he travelled to Brazzaville in 2007. The next year he returned to photograph them, collecting his images in the book ""Gentlemen of Bacongo."" He says individuals often belong to sub groups within the Sapeur culture, such as the Piccadilly group, who dress in Scottish kilts. ""One member has a sister in Scotland who brings him kilts,"" he explains. ""They use and they adapt to their taste and individuality. They are masters of style, they create their own style."" See also: Congo's erupting volcano boosts tourism . Some disapprove of the Sapeurs spending what little money they have on the frivolities of fashion. But Gondola argues that being a Sapeur isn't just about vanity -- it's a political statement. In the 1970s ""authenticity"" was part of the state ideology in the DRC -- a policy that prohibited the wearing of Western suits. The Sapeurs rebelled by wearing aggressively non-conformist clothes, including leather suits, says Gondola. To this day Kinshasa's Sapeurs dress less conservatively than their suit-sporting Brazzaville brethren. ""The Sapeur is also about masculinity, politics, changing the stereotypes about how people view Africa,"" says Gondola. ""It's about a lot of things, about beating the West at its own game, which is fashion: 'You colonized us but we dress better than you.'"" Gondola says the history of the Sapeurs can be traced back to the 19th century, when the Republic of the Congo was a French colony. Some colonial masters would pay their servants in used clothes, and those servants would make a show of wearing their masters' clothes on Sundays. He adds that the phenomenon grew in the 1920s and 30s among Congolese nationals living in Paris -- in particular Sap pioneer and anti-colonial activist André Matswa. But it really took off after independence in 1960, when ordinary Congolese people would travel to Paris and return home wearing the latest fashions. In the 1970s, popular musician Papa Wemba, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), began promoting the idea of the Sapeur, forming the ""Société des Ambianceurs et Persons Élégants,"" or SAPE, of which many modern-day Sapeurs claim membership. So what is the enduring appeal of the Sapeur? ""It's politics, spiritual, aesthetic, social -- so many things,"" says Gondola. ""It's a whole science -- they are artists.""","""Sapeurs"" are a Congolese sub-culture of dapper dressers .
Despite usually working menial jobs, they wear expensive European labels .

"What a difference a day makes. On Wednesday, Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich seemed outraged after learning that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's appointees had apparently targeted his town as part of a political vendetta, orchestrating traffic jams because he hadn't endorsed the governor. ""I'm actually rooting that the highest elected official in the state of New Jersey isn't involved in this, but I will tell you, I'm beginning to question my judgment,"" he said, saying that the traffic snarls caused by lane closures on the George Washington Bridge ""put my town in harm's way."" Asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer whether he would accept a phone call apologizing from Christie, Sokolich said the governor shouldn't bother. ""Do me a favor, don't call me, but call the families who were waiting three, four times longer for emergency services when their loved ones were having heart palpitations or when their loved ones had extreme chest pains and were waiting for our ambulance corps to arrive,"" he said. ""Do me a favor, call and apologize to thousands of families whose kids were late for the first day of school and the three or four days that ensued thereafter. Call our police department. Call our administrators in the school system that had to deal with this. Call the folks that had to deal with traffic Armageddon that week. Don't call me."" Even as Christie publicly apologized at a press conference Thursday, Sokolich said he didn't want the governor to come to his town before an investigation into the matter was complete. ""It would appear that there is still some untold chapters here,"" he said, ""and we wouldn't want him to expend gas unnecessarily."" Sokolich said he welcomed the apology, but didn't need to hear it in person -- yet. ""To do it now in light of what's transpired over the last 24 hours, it's just going to cause more chaos in Fort Lee. We don't need it at this point. And I've got to tell you, I think he ought to wait for this investigation to conclude, otherwise we're going to be spending a lot of gas coming up and down the turnpike."" But later in the day Thursday, after meeting with Christie, he struck a more measured tone. ""I'm glad he came. I take him for his word, which is he had nothing to do with it. And I said this once, I said this 100 times. We in Fort Lee are not rooting for facts to, you know, come about and surface that would suggest in some shape or form that he was involved in it. We take him for his word."" Sokolich described his meeting with Christie as ""productive"" and ""cordial."" ""I accepted his apology. Yes I did. .... When I was also speaking to you folks while the governor was conducting his press conference, I had indicated that, you know, maybe it wouldn't be productive (for him) to come up now, and I explained to the governor that wasn't to be disrespectful. It was just to -- wouldn't it make more sense to do this once the investigation was concluded? "" Sokolich said. ""The governor respectfully insisted, and we certainly would welcome any governor, and especially our governor .... with open arms, as we did.""","On Wednesday, Mayor Mark Sokolich said ""traffic Armageddon"" put his town in harm's way .

"Ebola has officially been eradicated from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the World Health Organization declared Friday, even amid fresh concerns about the deadly virus in places like Sierra Leone and Mali. The United Nations health agency cleared the DRC for Ebola because 42 days had passed since tests came back negative on the last person with the disease and there have been no other cases since. The WHO credited the central African country's leadership and effective coordination, including steps to monitor those with the disease and the people they had been in contact with, for the milestone. This marks the seventh Ebola outbreak in the DRC since the virus was first identified in 1976, the agency said. The Democratic Republic of Congo has had 38 confirmed and 28 probable reported Ebola cases in recent months. Of those, 49 people -- including eight health care workers -- have died. The DRC's Ebola cases aren't related to those in hard-hit West Africa, though they come at a time when many around the continent are dealing with the same disease. The DRC joins other countries, such as Nigeria and Senegal, that the WHO has declared Ebola-free in recent weeks. This good news notwithstanding, Ebola remains a very real threat elsewhere, particularly in West Africa. And in some places, things are getting worse. That includes Mali, where the first case of Ebola came from a 2½-year-old girl who'd crossed the border. Then there was a 70-year-old grand imam who came from Guinea to Bamako, where he died on October 27, prompting authorities to try to track down hundreds who were in contact with him. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called ""the new trail of transmissions in Mali ... a cause of deep concern,"" announcing that WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan will head to the country to assist officials there. ""We must smother this little fire, this little smoke before it gets out of control,"" Chan said. ""... I am confident that, if we work together as one, we will be able to bring this outbreak under control."" Six Ebola cases have been reported so far in Mali. Contrast that with Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, home to the vast majority of more than 15,000 Ebola cases and over 5,000 deaths in recent months, according to a WHO report out Friday. French President Francois Hollande plans to spend November 28-30 in that stricken region -- including a visit to Guinea, a former French colony -- to address how to combat the virus, the Elysee Palace announced Friday. France is giving more than $40 million to set up Ebola treatment centers in Guinea, as well as to send medical and related equipment to that and other West African nations. Yet that's just a fraction of what's been requested to help fight the disease. The United Nations this year launched a $1 billion campaign to fight Ebola, but so far, it has fallen well short of that goal. UN's fast-track Ebola fund falls woefully short . U.N Under-Secretary-General Kandeh Yumkella told CNN's Richard Quest on Thursday that he is ""cautiously optimistic"" that Ebola will be brought under control, pointing, for example, to successes containing the disease in Liberia and increased awareness in some of the hardest-hit areas. But he also said that ""infection rates are increasing exponentially"" in parts of Sierra Leone, particularly its capital of Freetown. The U.N. official said the future rests in part on what and how much the international community does to help corral the virus. Talking about Freetown, the former Sierra Leone trade minister said, ""If you look at the spike in the capital, we cannot afford one minute of complacence, whether locally or internationally."" Chan echoed this view Friday for all areas now battling Ebola, saying ""we must maintain our vigilance"" given that for all the places where the outbreak appears to be stabilizing, new cases are still popping up elsewhere. But if the international community, local leaders and the residents of Africa do their part, Ban said, there's hope that Ebola can be beaten. ""If we continue to accelerate our response,"" the U.N. leader said, ""we can contain and end the outbreak by the middle of next year.""","U.N. leader says the Ebola outbreak could be over by the middle of 2015 .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama signed legislation Thursday evening extending several key provisions of the Patriot Act shortly before they were set to expire at midnight. The provisions -- passed after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack -- deal with roving wiretaps, the tracking of alleged ""lone wolf"" terrorists, and the ability of law enforcement officials to obtain records they deem relevant to an investigation after securing an order from a federal court. The bill passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate earlier in the day. Obama, currently on a trip to Europe, directed the use of an autopen -- a signature reproduction device -- to sign the measure, according to White House spokesman Nick Shapiro. The House was forced to briefly delay the start of its Memorial Day recess to vote on the measure.  A protracted dispute over the legislation in the Senate, fueled by conservative newcomer Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, muddied voting schedules. Paul reached a deal with Senate leaders to allow votes on whether to table two of his amendments. Both amendments failed, and the subsequent Senate vote on the measure to extend the Patriot Act provisions for four years passed easily on a 72-23 vote. The 250-153 House vote was tighter, with lawmakers on the right and left opposing an extension for various reasons.  For example, some members of Congress are concerned about the law's impact on civil liberties, while others support the law but think it should be made permanent. One of the three provisions, Section 206 of the Patriot Act, provides for roving wiretap surveillance of targets who try to thwart Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) surveillance. Without such roving wiretap authority, investigators would be forced to seek a new court order each time they need to change the location, phone or computer that needs to be monitored. Another provision, Section 215 of the Patriot Act, allows the FBI to apply to the FISA court to issue orders granting the government access to any tangible items in foreign intelligence, international terrorism and clandestine intelligence cases. The third provision, Section 6001 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004, closes a loophole that could allow individual terrorists not affiliated with specific organizations to slip through the cracks of FISA surveillance. Law enforcement officials refer to it as the ""lone wolf"" provision. Legislators opposed to the extensions claim that the provisions -- particularly related to wiretapping -- are intrusive and unconstitutional. Supporters argue that they are a critical component of U.S. anti-terror operations. Paul, a favorite of the Tea Party movement, engaged in a bitter showdown Wednesday with Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nevada, who sought to limit the number of amendments that Paul could offer. Then on Thursday, Paul complained that it was Senate Republican leaders now holding up consideration of his amendments. In a rare public rebuke of his own party's leadership, Paul said he was ""disappointed"" by their actions and urged people to contact GOP leadership offices in protest. ""I've been working for two long days filibustering the Patriot Act in hopes that we can have a constitutional debate over certain provisions of it and we can try to reform it to take away some of the encroachments on our freedoms,"" Paul said. ""Unfortunately, what we're finding now is that the Democrats have agreed to allow me to have amendments, but my own party is refusing to allow me to debate or present my amendments."" In particular, Paul sought to propose an amendment preventing warrantless access to some gun records. Republican leaders don't want a vote on his amendment because they are conflicted by it, Paul said. They don't want to vote to weaken the Patriot Act by making it more difficult for law enforcement to obtain any information -- including gun records -- related to a terrorism investigation, he said, but they also don't want to take a vote that could be viewed negatively by gun rights groups. One Senate Republican leader, Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, rejected Paul's analysis but refused to explain why or even if GOP leaders were blocking Paul's amendment. After reaching the deal to debate two of his amendments, Paul said on the Senate floor that his motivation was to protect personal liberties rather than to harm the Patriot Act or undermine security in any way. ""It's very important that we are always vigilant, that we are eternally vigilant about the powers of government,"" Paul said in arguing for tighter restrictions on the ability of federal investigators to access some gun ownership records. He went on to complain in general about what he characterized as a federal overreaction to the 9/11 attacks that reduced individual liberty in the name of security. For example, he said, airline travelers are all considered possible terrorists and screened for security reasons; he described such a strategy as a ""shotgun"" approach. ""Are we so afraid that we're giving up all of our liberty for security?"" Paul asked, calling for tighter restrictions on what the government can investigate without a search warrant. However, fellow conservative Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Georgia, said Paul's amendment to end warrantless access to gun records would hinder the government's ability to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States. ""I don't understand why we would take this tool away from national security investigators,"" Chambliss said, adding that there have been ""no reports that the government has ever used these provisions to violate anyone's Second Amendment rights.""

"Australia has been revealed as the world's happiest industrialized nation, taking the title for the fourth year running. The so-called ""lucky country"" beat Norway and Sweden to take the top spot in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Better Life Index. The OECD, an international organization uniting high-income developed countries, ranks its members according to 11 different criteria, which it views as essential to a happy life. Its happiness index -- one of many such indexes published each year -- is the product of ten years' research, Romina Boarini, head of OECD's monitoring  well-being and progress unit, said. It differs from other indexes due to its high quality of data and interactivity with users, she added. The OECD began investigating contributors to happiness and well-being in the early 2000s, looking at  straight-forward indicators such income and wealth alongside others which are more difficult to quantify, such as civic engagement. Other indicators used are health and education, the quality of local environment, personal security and overall satisfaction with life. The data is then analyzed to ensure it can translate across the OECD countries. Australians enjoy above average quality of life in nearly all of them, according to the report published on Monday. The country ""down under"" ranks at the top in civic engagement, which looks at voters' participation, among other criteria. It also comes out above average, in the list of  36 countries, in environmental quality, health status, housing, personal security, jobs and earnings, education and skills, subjective well-being, social connections, and income and wealth. The survey uses scientific research to find out what makes people happy by letting them decide which criteria are the most important to them and place bigger or smaller value on each category. Those who see the environment or work-life balance as key to their happiness can boost the value of those qualities in their own ranking and see how they compare to people who place more importance on things like education or income. According to the 60,000 people who have shared their views so far, the most important factor for being happy is life satisfaction, with health and education close behind. ""There are differences depending on where you come from, how old you are, and sometimes whether you are a man or a woman,"" the OECD researchers explain in their report. People in Japan think personal security is the top priority for well-being, and those in Latin America value education the most, the OECD says. Australians say the most valuable is having a good balance between work and personal life, which is also the only category in which they lag behind the average. Two countries, the UK and Iceland, dropped from last year's top 10 and were replaced by Finland at number nine, and New Zealand at number 10. At the bottom of the ranking of the 36 industrialized nations are Greeks (34), who the OECD says suffer from the lowest life satisfaction, Mexico (35), where the biggest problem is safety, measured by murder and assault rates, and Turkey (36) which ranks poorly in the income and housing categories as well as life satisfaction and work-life balance. But even the countries at the bottom of the chart have reasons to be happy. The OECD highlights Greece's above the average health and quality of environment and Mexico's high levels of life satisfaction. Turkey, although still trailing behind the rest of the industrialized country, is praised for the progress in improving the quality of life of its citizens over the last two decades.

"People visit Jerusalem for the rich history, interwoven religious narratives and crumbling holy walls. They visit Europe for ornate churches with painted ceilings and golden trim. They visit India for peace of mind, finding serenity in its carved and colorful temples scattered along the sacred Ganges River. But people rarely travel the U.S. in search of such sanctuaries. After all, what religious wisdom could America, a country still in its youth at 236 years old, have to offer? Although the country may not have a reputation for religious landmarks, America is home to more than just secular city halls and strip malls. Whether or not you practice a faith, visiting these beautiful and historic U.S. religious spots may provide inspiration. Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois . This Bahá'í House of Worship is one of just seven Bahá'í temples in the world and is the only of its kind found in North America. It's just 30 minutes north of Chicago in Wilmette, Illinois. Although the house of worship was created with a mixture of quartz and cement, the intricately carved temple looks as if it's made of white lace. Like all Bahá'í houses of worship, the circular temple has nine sides and is surrounded by fountain-filled gardens. The temple services members of the Bahá'í faith, a religion founded in 19th-century Persia that stresses unity of all humankind. Anyone is welcome to visit the space -- its auditorium and gardens are open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day free of charge. ""We don't ask what your religion is -- we don't even care,"" the temple's summer tour coordinator, Gwendolyn Clayborne, said. ""It's a place for people to come and meditate and pray and just get in touch with their spiritual sides."" Clayborne said people are surprised such a temple, which was completed in 1953 and took more than 30 years to construct, can be found in Illinois. ""A few people from Chicago will admit it's the best kept secret,"" Clayborne said. Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California . With its traditional Chinese design, this Buddhist temple looks like it came from the Far East. Although it was completed in 1988, the temple's architecture is faithful to the Ming and Ch'ing dynasties, which ruled in China from the 14th to 20th centuries. The Hsi Lai Temple features golden tiles in its buildings, protective figurines on its roof and a peaceful courtyard at its center. A bird's-eye view shows the building is shaped like a bodhi leaf, symbolic of the tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment. Inside the temple, an art gallery includes both Eastern and Western paintings, ceramics, photographs and Buddhist artifacts. ""People come here and say, 'I don't know I'm in Southern California. It seems I am in another part of the world,'"" said the temple's director of outreach, Miao Hsi. The temple is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day free of charge, and tours are offered on weekends. For a $7 donation, visitors can enjoy the temple's Chinese vegetarian buffet. Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, Michigan . Although it is a modern mosque in Michigan, inspiration for the Islamic Center of America came from venerable houses of worship in Turkey, India and other countries. With a stone-carved edifice and fiberglass dome, the mosque's design is distinct. Inside, visitors will find crystal chandeliers, imported granite and a prayer room decorated with Islamic motifs and calligraphy of Quranic verses created by a Lebanese artist. The 65,000-square-foot facility services nearly 5,000 families in a city with one of the largest Arab-Muslim populations in the U.S. This site has only been open since 2005, but the Islamic Center of America has been serving America's Muslims since 1962. Guests often are impressed with the mosque's beauty, but what they are most awed by is the center's openness, said Kassem Allie, the center's executive administrator. ""What people are kind of surprised about is we are so open to visitation and dialogue and collaboration,"" he said. ""I think they think we're a closed organization. ... They find out who we are and the fact that we have an open house."" The Islamic Center of America is open to visitors from 9 a.m. to about 11 p.m. daily and free tours of the facility can be scheduled on its website. Memorial Presbyterian Church in St. Augustine, Florida . Memorial Presbyterian Church may be beautiful, but it's the story behind the building that often touches visitors the most. The church is dedicated to Jenny Louise Benedict, the daughter of tycoon Henry Morrison Flagler, who built the church in 1889. Flagler had always had a special place for St. Augustine in his heart, investing heavily in the city after visiting with his first wife, Mary. And when his beloved daughter died after complications from childbirth, Flagler knew the Presbyterian church he was planning to build in town would be erected in her honor. Flagler, along with Mary, Jenny Louise and his granddaughter, Marjorie, are all entombed at the church. The structure's detailed design draws influence from the churches of Europe, including Venice's St. Mark's Basilica. It features wood-carved walls, stained-glass windows, a peaceful sanctuary and a prominent dome that inspires guests to lift their eyes toward the heavens. ""People walk in, and they see a little piece of Europe,"" church historian Jay Smith said. ""I wouldn't say it rivals the European cathedrals, but it has its own unique beauty and majesty, and people are very surprised by that."" Smith said people must remember to appreciate the rich history of Memorial Presbyterian Church and the city that surrounds it. Founded in 1565, St. Augustine is the longest continually inhabited city founded by Europeans in the U.S. Memorial Presbyterian Church is open to visitors from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and tours of the building are conducted on weekdays. Temple Emanu-El in New York City . With a sanctuary that stands 103 feet tall, 100 feet wide and 175 feet long and seating for 2,500 people, New York's Temple Emanu-El is one of the largest Jewish temples in the world. Inside, Temple Emanu-El is full of color. The ceiling is painted and gilded, its arches are lined with mosaics of glass and marble, and there are more than 60 stained glass windows. The temple is also home to a museum that houses artifacts important in Jewish history. Completed in 1929, Temple Emanu-El's 5th Avenue and 65th Street location is the fifth home for its congregation, whose members have been worshiping in New York since 1845. Mark Heutlinger, administrator of the Emanu-El congregation, said the temple and its members are an important fixture ""on the greatest street in the greatest land in the greatest city of religious freedom."" ""We are a part and parcel of the mosaic society of New York — the quilt of cultures that represents New York City,"" Heutlinger said. Admission to Temple Emanu-El is free, and it is open from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Sunday through Thursday. Palace of Gold in Moundsville, West Virginia . A name like Palace of Gold comes with high expectations, and this West Virginia shrine doesn't disappoint. The Indian-inspired palace is expansive, with marble floors, crystal chandeliers, stained-glass windows, wood-carved furniture and walls covered in leaves of 22-karat gold. The grounds surrounding the building feature an impressive rose garden, a fountain, thousands of different bushes and a lotus-filled lake. It's hard to believe this exquisite palace, which opened in 1979, was initially intended to be just a simple house. In 1973, West Virginia devotees of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, a Hindu organization more commonly known in the U.S. as the Hare Krishna movement, had decided to build a home for their leader, Srila Prabhupada. But when Prabhupada died in 1977, the disciples' course of construction changed, and they began instead to build a memorial for Prabhupada. And with that, the elaborate Palace of Gold was born. April through August, the Palace of Gold is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, and tours are available: $8 for adults and $6 for children ages 6 to18. From September to March, its hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and tours are $6 per adult and $3 per child. Salt Lake Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah . Not everyone who travels to the Salt Lake City Temple is allowed inside the walls, but that doesn't mean they can't enjoy its splendor. Only temple recommended Mormons may step foot inside the structure, which is used for special instruction and ordinances, such as celestial marriages. But the view from outside the temple is inspirational enough. The Neo-Gothic building, which was dedicated in 1893, took 40 years to construct. Except for some of its hardware and glass, the temple was built completely of native materials. With five floors, six spires -- the tallest standing at 210 feet -- and a granite facade, the structure is definitely imposing. Salt Lake Temple is at the heart of Temple Square, three blocks containing nearly 20 attractions significant to Latter-day Saints' life and history, such as Assembly Hall and the Salt Lake City Tabernacle. In 2011, Temple Square saw about 2,750,000 visitors from all over the world. And for those not allowed inside the temple, a scaled model is on display in the Temple Square South Visitors' Center, which shows off the building's interior. Most buildings in Temple Square are open daily to the public, free of charge. St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City . Although St. Patrick's Cathedral isn't as tall as the skyscrapers that surround it, the cathedral has an old-world grandeur that's rare in New York. The design of this Neo-Gothic church, which features soaring spires, an elaborate marble exterior and colorful stained glass windows, was inspired by the great cathedrals of Europe. Replacing a church of the same name, St. Patrick's Cathedral opened its doors in 1879 to help accommodate a growing Catholic population in the city. The cathedral is iconic in Midtown Manhattan, known as a place of retreat, Monsignor Robert Ritchie said. ""It's kind of an oasis of quiet inside the hustle and bustle of the surrounding area,"" Ritchie said. ""It's a place people can go with their problems, a place where people can just go and look at some beautiful scenery, a place where people can pray."" Open from 6:30 a.m. to 8:45 p.m. daily, the church welcomes visitors. Free guided group tours can also be scheduled during weekdays.","Some beautiful and historic U.S. religious sites are scattered across the country .

"If you have ambitions of being one of the first people on Mars, listen up: A Dutch company says it is moving along with its plan to send four lucky Earthlings to colonize the Red Planet. The catch: They won't ever come back. The Mars One foundation announced Tuesday that it has secured lead suppliers for an unmanned mission launching in 2018, which involves a robotic lander and a communications satellite. Lockheed Martin has been contracted to study building the lander, and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. will develop a concept study for the satellite, Mars One said. This first mission will demonstrate technology that would be involved in a permanent human settlement on Mars. If all goes well -- and that's still very much an ""if"" -- the first pioneers could land on Mars in 2025. Enthusiasm has been growing since the project's first big announcement in April. More than 200,000 people have signed up to be prospective astronauts, Mars One CEO Bas Lansdorp said in Washington on Tuesday. Apparently, they're OK with living out the rest of their lives on Mars. The technology for a return flight doesn't exist -- there's no Kennedy Space Center launch pad over there! -- and having a one-way trip greatly reduces costs, the company has said. The application period is now closed, and by the end of this year, the company plans to notify those special folk who made it to Round 2. The unmanned mission is the ""most important and most difficult step of actually getting humans to Mars,"" Lansdorp said. It would also be the first privately funded planetary exploration mission. ""The opportunity to participate in that is just really exciting,"" said Ed Sedivy, a chief engineer at Lockheed Martin Space Systems. Lansdorp expects that the majority of funding for the unmanned missions will come from sponsors and partners, not public contributions. The cost of the lander and satellite will be something that the contracted companies will study, although Mars One has a ballpark figure in mind, Lansdorp said. Mars Curiosity rover finds life-supporting chemicals . What they want to send in 2018 . The lander will be based on the successful NASA Phoenix mission, Lansdorp said. The Mars One probe will feature a robotic arm carrying a camera that will shoot continuous video, as well as a water experiment that will demonstrate the production of liquid water on the surface of Mars. ""The highest priority is to actually have liquid water on Mars,"" he said. This unmanned mission will also carry the winning projects from an experiment contest. There will be a worldwide university challenge giving teams the chance to propose tests to carry out on Mars. These could be science experiments, of course, but Mars One is also interested in ""fun"" experiments. One of Lansdorp's visions, for instance, is a balloon with a camera attached to it that would film Mars from an altitude of 200 to 500 meters, which has never been done. The communications satellite will provide live video feed from surface of Mars to Earth, representing the first Mars synchronous communications satellite, Lansdorp said. Tourist trips to the Moon by 2043? Getting to Mars . Mars One was originally slated to land the first humans in 2023, but the project has been delayed. After the first humans arrive in 2025, the plan is send additional crews every two years, Lansdorp said. Right now, the idea is to send crews of four, but eventually bigger vehicles may become available to transport more people. Is there enough time to get the lander and satellite on their way by 2018? Sedivy said it takes about 3½ years from commitment to initiating a preliminary design to launch, so that gives his company about a year of leeway to study this concept before promising to execute it. That timeline is ""pretty favorable,"" he said Tuesday. But as to whether it's enough time to develop the science side of things, that's ""a little tricky,"" he said. It takes money . Mars One is looking at ""a range of funding scenarios."" The total estimated budget for getting the first four humans to Mars is $6 billion. Lansdorp would not disclose how much money has been secured from partners and sponsors but said donations currently total more than $200,000. A reality TV concept may help recoup costs. Lansdorp noted that Mars One will have the most unique video ""available in the solar system,"" which has a lot of value, and he hopes this will attract sponsors and partners. Media coverage will be a main funding source. But will the money come through? Will the technology really be developed by 2018 for the unmanned mission and to send people there by 2025? Will four humans survive the journey in a tight space capsule and embrace a desolate planet as their home? As Lansdorp himself said Tuesday, ""You can't go to Mars on excitement."" Time will tell whether prospective applicants can go at all. Follow Elizabeth Landau at @lizlandau .","More than 200,000 people say they want to go to Mars .

"Yvonne Hampton is 69 years old, and lives clear across the country from her older brother, Bill. But she can still rely on him to look out for her -- just as he did when she was growing up. ""The way our parents raised us, we stood up for ourselves, and my brother always protected me,"" Hampton said. Even though Bill stuck up for his little sister as they came of age in Poughkeepsie, New York, he couldn't always protect himself, or her, from the cruel words of playmates who viewed their dark skin as offensive. ""We were made fun of, called 'Little Black Sambo' -- that was our introduction to kindergarten,"" she said. ""You were made to feel 'less than' because your skin was darker, and (that) being dark brown or black was ugly."" Hampton's experiences as a ""dark girl"" were an inspiration for Bill Duke's documentary that explores the sometimes painful, undercover story of colorism -- discrimination based on skin tone -- inside and outside the black community. Now a respected actor and filmmaker, Duke used his industry clout to bring attention to the issue. Duke, along with D. Channsin Berry, co-directed and co-produced ""Dark Girls,"" which will be released on DVD September 24. When it premiered on the OWN channel earlier this year, the film stirred spirited conversation about black beauty, just as it did at screenings around North America. ""DARK GIRLS is a phenomenal documentary that opens the door on that light skinned/dark skinned thang,"" Oprah tweeted in June. After the trailer hit the Web in 2011, the filmmakers soon learned that the issue did not only resonate among darker-hued American women. ""I started getting e-mails from women in Poland, and I was thinking to myself, I don't know any black women in Warsaw, or Poland or other places around there,"" Berry said. ""And I kept getting (correspondence) from women's groups in the Netherlands asking us to talk about this, and screen the movie.  And it was deep."" In this edited conversation, co-directors Bill Duke and D. Channsin Berry shared with CNN what they learned making the film and how the conversation began. CNN: How did two male directors become interested in making a film about ""Dark Girls""? Duke: I saw the things that my sister went through -- she's dark skinned -- with boys not considering her attractive in her youth and the pain that it caused her. You have to explain to people the damage that it does to a young woman, and to see it and experience it is something that you don't forget: her crying in her room alone, her trying to lighten her skin, her feeling ugly, me having to beat up young boys because they said she was ugly, that type of thing. CNN:  How do you define ""dark girls""? The documentary begins by looking at the issues of intracultural colorism within the black American community, but also touches on issues of color in India and around the world. Berry: It changed, it really changed through my research.  It was about sisters who were dark in complexion.  But the more I started to do interviews around the country and around the world -- and this is the crazy thing I found out, it was so enlightening -- that all women around the world are ""dark girls"" at some point in time in their lives.  It has nothing to do so much with the complexion of one's skin.  It has everything to do with the lack of women's self-esteem. That's what I learned. And I also learned that pain is pain: If you're dark, you've got some pain, if you're light in complexion, you've got some pain. CNN: Was there a particularly emotional or difficult time for you, personally, in your process of filmmaking? How did it impact you? Duke: I think the footage that came in with the children. The little girl, when she's asked 'What's beautiful?' points to everything that is opposite of (what) she is.  That one got to me because she's already saying that she is ugly and she's 6 or 7 years old. At that age, you're seeing (this) instilled in their consciousness, and what it does to their spirit and what it does to their self-esteem.  It's a very difficult thing to digest. And that's what motivates me to do something. Because our children are at stake. CNN: You did the film in 2011 and screened it in major American cities before it was picked up by OWN and aired earlier this year. What was the reaction from audiences? Was there any resistance to a topic that is rarely discussed across racial lines? Duke: Are you kidding me?! Of course. I was at a theater, and an elderly lady -- beautiful woman -- stands up and says:  'Mr. Duke, I really appreciate your film, but why are you airing our dirty laundry?' and I said to her: 'Because it's stinking up the house.'  The things that kill us as a (black) community is our silence. CNN: How has the conversation around this issue changed from when you began the project in 2011 to now in 2013? Berry: The conversation is now open, and that's all we can do. I'm not a psychiatrist or psychologist or a sociologist.  I'm a filmmaker who decided to point a lens (on this topic). I don't have all the answers.  I'm just supposed to present what I think is an issue and have dialogue start.  And that was good enough. That was good enough that people recognize that there is an issue.  The best thing to do is start conversation about it, so the healing can begin.","""Dark Girls"" looks at colorism in the black community and beyond .

"He's helped save a rhino's life, spoken at major tech conferences, won several awards and created an online community of thousands of users -- and he is just 16 years old. Teenager Nadav Ossendryver is the founder and developer of Latest Sightings, a crowd-sourcing website that provides real-time updates on animal sightings in Kruger National Park, South Africa's largest game reserve. Founded in November 2011, the site harnesses the power of social media to enable Kruger visitors to share the whereabouts of animals with other holidaymakers, thus increasing their chances of spotting the diverse wildlife that's populating the vast park -- from lions and cheetahs to leopards and elephants. Read: New monkey discovered . ""WOW! What a way to end the day!! 3 lioness and 9 cubs! Thank you for this wonderful page,"" reads one comment posted on Latest Sightings. ""YOU ARE A LEGEND!! Thank-you! Thank-you! Most amazing experience at Kruger... Wild Dogs SO close!!"" says another. It all began last year after one of Nadav's numerous visits to the world-famous Kruger, a stunning wildlife haven stretching out over 7,500 square miles. ""Whenever we came here I used to beg my parents to stop every car passing and ask them what they'd seen,"" remembers Nadav, who is currently a grade 10 student. ""After a while they got irritated, so I was thinking, what's an easy way of getting people to share their sightings without having to stop every car?"" When he returned to his Johannesburg home, the bright teenager put his mind to the task and after two weeks of non-stop work he created his first wildlife-tracking iPhone app. A little over a year later, Nadav says, the crowd-powered site has grown to win fans all over the world, helping wildlife enthusiasts enhance their safari experience. ""All together on Facebook, Twitter and the website, we've got over 33,000 people,"" says Nadav. ""When I started I thought I won't even get 100 people. I never thought they'll be more than 100 people that like Kruger enough to actually follow the sightings but now there are 33,000 people, it's just unbelievable."" Read: Last of the bush trackers on the trail of a dying art . Nadav remembers the case of an American couple visiting Kruger on a mission to see a leopard for the first time in their lives. The solitary, elusive cat is one of the most difficult animals to spot in the wild, but thanks to the site, Nadav says, the couple got lucky on their first day at the park. ""People go there for years and don't even see a leopard and they saw two leopard cubs in one day,""  he says. ""They said they could have gone home that afternoon and still be so happy. And when they got home finally, they told all their friends of how they had such an amazing time in Kruger."" But while members can report movements of any wildlife whilst scanning the open savannah, there is one animal whose whereabouts is banned from the site. ""We don't ever share rhino sightings because of the poaching,"" explains Nadav. ""It's a huge problem, there's poaching more or less every day."" Rhino poaching rates have soared in recent years in South Africa -- according to the country's officials, more than 450 rhinos have been killed this year. Latest Sightings carries telephone numbers where people can directly report rhino poaching, says Nadav, who encourages his followers to keep an eye out for hunters. Earlier this year, he was informed by a member about an injured rhino caught in a poacher's snare in Kruger. Nadav immediately passed on the details to a park ranger in order to prevent the animal, which was bleeding around its neck, from becoming an easy target for hunters. The ranger rushed to the scene and managed to save the stricken animal. ""If you see any suspicious activity then you can share it to us and we create awareness,"" says Nadav.

His numerous accolades include being named the youngest virtual honorary ranger from SANParks, South Africa's national parks service, as well as an eco ambassador for the Endangered Wildlife Trust. Looking ahead, Nadav says he'd like to expand the service to other game reserves so that he can improve the wildlife safari experience for tourists and help protect endangered species.

"A couple of years ago, I asked civil rights leader and former ambassador to the U.N. Andrew Young to tell me something about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that most people did not know. Young thought for a moment about the more personal side of his mentor and confidant. He said that King liked eating catfish, was quite a jokester and enjoyed laughing with friends. Among other things, King was an avid basketball player and a crafty passer with a great sense of the court. He could drive and shoot with both hands because he was ambidextrous. Young's depiction of his mentor as a joking hoopster reminded me of an important factor we often overlook when considering King's civil rights legacy: he was very young when he changed the world. Most people in their 20s struggle with dreams, doubts and career choices. In King's mid-20s, he was pastoring a church, co-founding the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott and receiving countless death threats. By his 30s, King was leading the monumental March on Washington and winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Clearly, King's youth was more of a catalyst than liability. In his cult classic book, ""Outliers,"" Malcolm Gladwell discussed how birth dates and timing were as crucial factors as talent and tenacity in forging the successful careers of athletes, business tycoons, technology innovators and other leaders. For example, Gladwell argued that had Bill Gates been born just 10 years earlier, there would have been no Microsoft.  Through a Gladwellian perspective, then, if King had been born 10 years earlier, there might not have been a Montgomery bus boycott. An older King might have been far too entrenched in black Baptist denominational politics or invested in clerical careerism to put everything on the line and lead a risky fringe boycott. His kids would have been older, his practical needs would have been greater and perhaps his judgments would have been more conservative, resembling the numerous middle-aged black Baptist preachers who had opposed activist strategies in favor of a less confrontational approach toward gradual reform in the civil rights movement. Similarly, young King's moral and spiritual discourse was the product of a malleable mind fresh out of graduate school, not the kind of predictable theorizing you would expect to see in an older preacher's cultural toolkit.  Young King synthesized Henry Thoreau's treatise on civil disobedience, Howard Thurman's theological philosophy, Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha and the Old Testament's views of justice to form a personal vision and tactic that awakened the moral consciousness of the nation. It's fortunate for us that King was not a middle-aged pastor when the moment in history demanded transformational leadership. He was just a young, fearless and somewhat naive pastor in Montgomery, Alabama. We can presume that the civil rights movement shaped King as much as he shaped the movement. With youth and inexperience on his side, young King had the improvisational space to carve out a movement philosophy and strategy that has been replicated many times over where people challenge oppressive governments. As we commemorate the birthday of our seminal civil rights leader, we should take some time out to remember that the same King who changed the course of history started out like you and me.  He liked playing basketball and joking with friends. He was young and had fire in his heart. King's legacy should inspire our youth to step up and exert the visionary leadership that will help guide us through our era of change and uncertainties. Tenured scholars, contentious politicians and fat-cat business executives are too cynical, comfortable and conservative to do anything. It's up to our wide-eyed students. And they should remember that youth is not an impediment; rather, it's the seed that can bring forth a better future. Just look at the young King.

"It sounds like advice offered by parents to teenagers on prom night: Don't do stupid stuff. But it also is an important guiding foreign policy principle of the President of the United States. Ever since the President uttered the phrase during an off-the-record discussion with reporters earlier this year -- the actual words were a bit saltier and later confirmed privately by administration officials -- foreign policy critics have seized on ""DDSS"" as a crystallization of the Obama Doctrine. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is only the latest critic of the ""DDSS"" comment, describing the remark in an interview with The Atlantic magazine as too simplistic. ""Great nations need organizing principles, and 'Don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle,"" she said. Clinton called Obama on Tuesday, to ""make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him,"" her spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement. The two will meet at a party hosted by Democratic Party adviser Vernon Jordan on Martha's Vineyard on Wednesday evening, after she holds a book signing on the island. In an interview with CNN, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes insisted that ""DDSS"" is not the ""entire foreign policy"" of the Obama administration. But he maintained the expression has substance. ""It means think carefully before you get into military interventions,"" he said. ""I think that's a lesson of the last 10 years that the American people have internalized -- that we have to be very careful when it comes to the application of military force, that we're not putting U.S. troops in harm's way without a clear plan and limited objectives for that effort."" Opinion: Hillary Clinton pummels Obama's foreign policy . Rhodes said the President did not take the criticism from Clinton personally. ""I think their relationship is very resilient. They've been through so much together,"" he said. What hand will al-Maliki play in Iraq . Shaped by more than a decade of war . Clinton's apparent support for a more hawkish U.S. posture comes as Obama's foreign policy has absorbed withering criticism in recent weeks. But her potentially more interventionist approach carries its own set of risks, diplomatic and political analysts caution. "" 'Don't do stupid stuff' ought to be emblazoned on the foreheads of all future presidents and secretaries of state,"" said Aaron David Miller, a former State Department adviser during both Democratic and Republican administrations. Miller said ""DDSS"" is less a doctrine than it is a presidential mission statement that is shaped by more than a decade of war. ""Stripped to its essence, after protecting the homeland, it should be U.S. foreign policy's second commandment,"" he added. ""I view that as a political summary ... much like 'It's the economy, stupid,' "" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, said, comparing ""DDSS"" to the middle-class battle cry coined by Bill Clinton strategist James Carville during the 1992 presidential election. Schiff said the former secretary of state's comments do not reflect a political break from the President, arguing the perception of a conflict just makes ""good copy."" Opinion: Clinton, Obama both wrong . The President's strategy on crises ranging from Syria to Iraq and Ukraine offers a sharp contrast to Republicans who ""act first and think last,"" Schiff said. ""The risks of becoming fully entangled in Iraq are tremendous,"" he added. The President's cautious approach is nothing new. A line can be traced from ""DDSS"" to the anti-Iraq war speech he delivered as an Illinois state senator in 2002. ""What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war,"" Obama said at the time. Scars from 2008 primary still remain . It was that 2002 speech that endeared Obama to the liberal base of the Democratic Party, in part because of then-Sen. Clinton's support for the Iraq war. The policy battle over Iraq that later erupted between Obama and Clinton in their fight for the party's nomination ultimately resulted in a Democrat returning to the White House. But the divide left deep scars between the two camps that were still healing even as Clinton unleashed her critique of Obama's worldview. That difficult history is why Clinton's comments to The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg came as a shock to one senior Democratic strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Specifically disturbing, the strategist said, was the former secretary of state's insistence that Obama's lack of support for the Syrian opposition gave rise to the ISIS militants in Iraq. ""Why you'd want to do that, I have no idea,"" the prominent, non-Obama affiliated strategist said of Clinton's plea for more direct U.S. involvement in Syria. Citing the nation's reluctance to plunge back into Middle East conflicts, the strategist added, ""Politically, Obama's right."" In a flashback to '08, Obamaworld lunged to the President's defense Tuesday, in a tweet that appeared to tweak Clinton. ""Just to clarify: 'Don't do stupid stuff' means stuff like occupying Iraq in the first place, which was a tragically bad decision,"" former Obama adviser David Axelrod tweeted. Better job communicating its strategy . Still, even the President's own advisers acknowledge that Obama has had a difficult time clearly articulating his foreign policy doctrine. During his overseas trip to Asia this year, Obama used a baseball metaphor to explain his reluctance to intervene militarily against a variety of threats, including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who crossed a ""red line"" set by the President barring chemical weapon use. That caution ""avoids errors,"" Obama said. ""You hit singles, you hit doubles; every once in a while, we may be able to hit a home run."" After much of Washington pounced on the sports analogy, White House aides began plotting out a more thoughtful speech on American leadership that would be delivered at West Point. Before that address, Rhodes conceded to The New York Times that the administration could do a better job of communicating its strategy. ""People are seeing the trees, but we're not necessarily laying out the forest,"" Rhodes said. Obama told the cadets at West Point the U.S. should be willing to intervene, but not overreach, acting alone only when necessary. ""Just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail,"" Obama said, opting to switch metaphors. The apparent struggle to neatly encapsulate the President's strategy is not lost on his critics. ""I do think the administration is showing some signs of a little bit of fatigue,"" Brookings Institution analyst Michael O'Hanlon said in a recent interview with CNN. ""It's time for a little more ambition frankly because the world senses that this President is too disengaged,"" O'Hanlon added. A now more ambitious Obama is engaged in Iraq, risking what his aides have long described as his post-Bush legacy of ""ending wars, not starting them."" As past presidents have learned in Iraq, it is ""easy to get in, hell to get out,"" Schiff said.","Hillary Clinton called Obama's guiding foreign policy principle too simplistic .

"Arkansas Realtor Beverly Carter went to show a home in the city of Scott on Thursday. Then, she vanished. On Sunday, a court issued an arrest warrant for Aaron M. Lewis, 33, in her disappearance. Police didn't say how they linked him to Carter. Lewis is still at large. Lewis had been in a traffic accident, and police went to scene, said Pulaski County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. Carl Minden. Lewis was taken to the hospital and, once there, left. Dozens of volunteers -- maybe as many as 200, according to authorities -- spent their Sunday searching for the missing woman in the Little Rock area. They will resume their search Monday. Her last phone call to her husband came Thursday afternoon, telling him the address where she would be. When hours went by with no further word from her, Carl Carter says he ""knew something was wrong."" This mysterious disappearance of the 49-year-old resonated among fellow Realtors,  who posted their own fears on a Facebook page set up for sharing information about her case. Carl Carter reported his wife missing that same Thursday, according to the Pulaski County, Arkansas, Sheriff's Office. Before calling authorities, Carl Carter went to the address of the home Beverly Carter was showing and saw her brown Cadillac parked there, the Sheriff's Office said. Noticing the property was open, the husband entered and searched for his wife without success, according to the Sheriff's Office. There has been activity on her cell phone since she disappeared, Minden said. Beverly Carter, who according to her employer's website has been married for 34 years and has four grandchildren, was last seen wearing a black sleeveless shirt and red capris. The search has focused on an area of flat farmland and swamp around the Arkansas River, Minden said. The Sheriff's Office has asked all owners of large tracts of land in the Scott area to search their properties. ""I feel like I'm in a fog, or a horrible nightmare from which I can't awaken,"" Beverly Carter's son, also named Carl, wrote on a Facebook post. ""She needs us, and we must continue to pray (and) brainstorm ways to find her."" The elder Carl -- Beverly's husband -- told CNN affiliate KARK that ""I would just like to have my wife back."" The social media hashtag #FindBeverly has gained steam, and the Facebook page about her disappearance was followed by more than 18,000 people as of Sunday evening. The Facebook page is filled with prayers for Beverly and her family, but also is a sounding board for Realtors from across the country on the issue of safety in their profession. ""I have been a Realtor for 36 years, and it gets more dangerous all the time,"" wrote Patricia Schmitz Manos, who described her method for sharing information about her location with family while showing homes. Another Realtor, Sharon Lynn Jarrell-Fleming, emphasized how she never shows a home alone. ""Partner up with an agent in your office for showings ... if someone is out to harm you they will if you're alone,"" she wrote. ""Buddy system!"" Others argued for Realtors to carry guns while showing homes. Others favored pepper spray or other deterrents. ""This is always a fear I've had,"" Nancy Israel Valene wrote. ""I am praying you find Beverly. She is me, she is you, and she is the entire Realtor community nationwide. Who could have imagined that this is a dangerous job? Not me.""","Volunteers will resume their search for the Realtor on Monday .

"Those who know him call him the ""gentlest person,"" but campus police said Monday that a 23-year-old student at a San Antonio-area Christian college took an officer's police baton and struck him before the officer fatally shot him. There is no dashboard video available, according to the university. The incident began when Cpl. Christopher Carter, a police officer with the University of the Incarnate Word in Alamo Heights, saw Robert Cameron Redus near campus ""driving erratically at a high rate of speed"" Friday, a university statement said. ""Carter was obligated to pull the suspect over to ensure the public's safety,"" the statement said. Redus pulled into an apartment complex, and Carter followed, mistakenly reporting the wrong street location to police dispatchers, which prompted his call to be routed from the Alamo Heights Police Department to its San Antonio counterparts, the statement said. This caused a delay of several minutes in response time. ""During the wait for assistance, the officer tried to restrain the suspect who repeatedly resisted,"" the statement said. ""During the struggle, the officer attempted to subdue the suspect with his baton. ... The baton was taken by the suspect who used it to hit the officer. ""The officer drew his firearm and was able to knock the baton from the suspect who continued to resist arrest. Shots were fired."" Redus did not identify himself, the university said, and there is ""no evidence"" the officer knew he was a student or where Redus lived. University police vehicles are typically equipped with dashboard cameras, but Carter's vehicle joined the fleet two days before the incident, and its camera fell off the next day when a temperature change prevented the glue from setting, the school said. ""Officers had made arrangements to have it remounted,"" the statement said. Carter, who has ""an extensive law enforcement background,"" has been placed on administrative leave -- standard procedure in these types of incidents, a university statement said, adding that all campus officers ""are licensed and trained as certified peace officers by the state of Texas."" Friends at the school say the Cameron Redus they know isn't the type to attack police. They knew a student who made the dean's list at the Catholic college and had been co-valedictorian of a Christian high school back home in Baytown, Texas. They knew a fun-loving campus television news anchor who was ""the sweetest, kindest, gentlest person,"" as friend Annie Jones described him to CNN affiliate WOAI-TV. A resident of Redus' apartment complex, 22-year-old Mohammad Haidarasl, told the San Antonio Express-News that Redus was his upstairs neighbor. Haidarasl told the paper he was on his apartment sofa at 2 a.m. when he heard noise outside, and a voice he believes to have been the officer's saying, ""Stop resisting, stop resisting."" The newspaper quoted Haidarasl as saying he thought he heard a struggle and ""Then the cop said, 'I'm going to shoot.' "" A male voice replied, "" 'Oh, you're gonna shoot me?' like sarcastic almost,"" Haidarasl said. Less than a minute later, he said, he heard shots. Alamo Heights police acknowledged the officer fired several shots. But they would not discuss other details of the alleged struggle, citing the ongoing investigation. The university said it was awaiting the results of the Alamo Heights police probe, which is being conducted with assistance from the Texas Rangers. Redus' family released a statement to CNN affiliate KENS-TV saying, ""We are understandably devastated by the death of our dear son Cameron and we ask for your prayers as we deal with our tragic loss. We trust that God is faithful and will see us through this most difficult time."" University President Lou Agnese said in a statement released to WOAI, ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the student and officer involved in this incident."" The university released a statement saying it, too, ""is deeply upset over the loss of life regardless of the circumstances."" It further said this was the first shooting in university history. Hundreds of people, including relatives of Redus, gathered at the university's convocation center Saturday for a vigil. Students brought a slideshow of Redus in happy poses. ""It makes me feel better that we've got a lot of support for Cameron,"" classmate Albert Salinas said outside the event in an interview with CNN affiliate KSAT-TV. But they left with no better idea of what happened to their friend.

"In the same week that witnessed the fall of Homs in the hands of the Assad regime both the U.S. and the UK announced a resumption of non-lethal aid to the Syrian rebels. While this is a highly symbolic move towards an opposition desperate for any kind of support, it is also symbolic in that it is unlikely to affect the balance of power on the ground. The U.S. and UK contribution is dwarfed into insignificance when compared to military, economic, logistic and diplomatic support that the regime gets from its allies, mainly Iran and Russia. The truce in Homs is a clear consequence of failing Western support to the opposition and the full support that the regime gets from its allies. A balance sheet that compares aid to the regime against that given to the opposition demonstrates clearly the imbalance in favor of the Assad regime. This goes some way in explaining two phenomena: one is the disappointment towards the Obama administration felt by many of its Arab allies and by the Syrian opposition who feel let down by the U.S.; two is the way in which Russia and Iran see military engagement and support to the regime in Syria as an integral part of their political and diplomatic strategy, while the U.S. and the UK seem to consider them as two separate processes: you either provide military support to the opposition or push for a diplomatic solution and cannot do both. U.S. aid of up to $27 million and UK aid of £1 million ($1.69 million) both in non-lethal aid like communications, medical equipment and food rations are being resumed after they had been suspended in December in the run-up to the Geneva II talks and only came up again after the failure of the diplomatic solution in Geneva II. Russian and Iranian aid to the regime has been continuous and much more substantial. Western policy in Syria projects weakness, hesitation and lack of strategy while Russia and Iran have shown strength, resolve and their policy is part of a wider strategy in confrontation with the U.S. The U.S. was also pressuring its own regional allies like Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries to restrain their support for the opposition mainly on the grounds that a military solution was impossible. Iranian and Russian assistance . It is difficult to accurately estimate the Iranian and Russian contributions. The European Council on Foreign Relations report on Syria's war economy mentions financial help of up to $5.8 billion in the form of cash and oil supplies in mid 2011 and two credit facilities in 2013 worth a combined $4.3 billion. Burhan Ghalioun, the former head of the Syrian National Council recently claimed that Iranian assistance to the regime is well over $14 billion so far. The figures would shoot up if military assistance could be estimated. What we know is that the Quds force, the foreign arm of the IRGC has hundreds of commanders involved in Syria. Iran also arms and trains Hezbollah in Lebanon and several Iraqi militias that are fighting in Syria and sends arms and munitions. The strain on the Iranian economy is unsustainable and there are already Iranian dissident voices blaming involvement in Syria for a large part of the country's economic problems. Russia also provides economic and military assistance to the regime, propping up the currency and circumventing the sanctions. Syrian currency is now printed in Russia and military assistance is both technical and hardware. The balance sheet also includes billions of dollars of Western humanitarian aid that goes through the U.N. and other international organizations. The bulk of it goes to dealing with the symptoms of the war-like refugees and the rest largely goes through the regime and the regime uses it to its benefit in its surrender or starve strategy in sieges like that of Homs. The scenario is simple: the regime cuts off water, electricity, food, fuel and access; it then proceeds to bomb the city into submission using artillery, air raids and barrel bombs. and then the UN and other international organizations who are also Western funded, help the regime and its allies to negotiate surrenders that are euphemistically called ""local ceasefires"" as we have seen in Homs and in other areas recently. Difference in strategy . The difference in strategy is flagrant: Iran and Russia boost military assistance to strengthen Assad's hand in the negotiations; while the US and the UK all but freeze support to the opposition which amounts to pressuring them to compromise in negotiations.  Aaron David Miller even argues in a Foreign Policy piece that the main reason for President Barack Obama's hesitation to assist the rebels in Syria is so as not to jeopardize his engagement with Iran under the logic that you cannot talk and shoot at the same time. There may also be different perceptions of the importance of the conflict in Syria. The White House may perceive it as marginal at a time when it is shifting its interest away from the Middle East to Asia. It is thus a local conflict where you could stand aside and wait to see which side would win. Iran and Russia are playing to win and see it as a more strategic battle with objectives beyond Syria possibly against the U.S. and its global power. It may also be argued that perceived U.S. weakness cannot be confined to its position in Syria. While it has disappointed its allies who feel let down; it has at the same time emboldened its enemies who feel they can take advantage of it. Russia can thus think it can get away with bold moves in Ukraine and Iran thinks it can play the classic trick of good-cop/bad-cop where good-cop is President Rouhani with a smile and a tweet, willing to negotiate but only on the nuclear deal; and the bad cop is General Qassem Suleimani the commander of the IRGC and has a free hand to fight against U.S. interests in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan and other areas the Quds Force is active in. If anything, this is a situation similar to that in Iraq in 1991 when an uprising was encouraged by Washington, and then the U.S. and its allies stood by watching Saddam Hussein's helicopters crush it, killing in two months as much as Bashar al-Assad has in the last three years.","The Homs truce is a consequence of failing Western support to the opposition, writes Nadim Shehadi .

"(CNN) -- A former Pennsylvania juvenile judge was sentenced to 28 years in prison Thursday after being convicted for a scheme to make millions off unjustly incarcerating young people, court officials said. Former Luzerne County Judge Mark Ciavarella was also ordered by a federal judge in Pennsylvania to pay about $1 million in restitution. The sentence was four times the 87 months sentence that Ciavarella and federal prosecutors had agreed to when he pleaded guilty to charges in 2009. But that plea deal was thrown out by a federal judge and the case went to trial. Ciavarella was found guilty in February of 12 of 39 racketeering and fraud charges for accepting millions of dollars in bribes from friends who owned detention centers to which he sent juveniles. The case made national headlines when Ciavarella was confronted by a distraught mother outside a courtroom after his conviction. Sandy Fonzo's 17-year-old son, Edward Kenzakowski, spent six months in a detention center after Ciavarella sentenced him for possession of drug paraphernalia. According to Fonzo, her son, who had no prior record, was never able to recover and eventually took his own life. ""He (Ciavarella) killed his spirit,"" Fonzo said at the time, ""He crushed him, and he didn't help him."" Fonzo said her son was full of resentment and pent-up anger after being sent to the detention center. ""He was just never the same,"" Fonzo said. She said in February she came to the courthouse believing Ciavarella would be taken straight to jail. But when she found out he was going home and would not be sentenced until later, she was shocked and angered, and began shouting at Ciavarella. Fonzo's confrontation was captured by television cameras. ""Do you remember me?"" Fonzo screamed lunging toward Ciavarella, ""Do you remember my son?"" she screamed again. ""He's gone,"" she cried, ""He shot himself in the heart, you scumbag!""","Mark Ciavarella was ordered to pay about $1 million in restitution .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A contrite head of the Federal Protective Service took the blame Wednesday for security lapses that allowed covert investigators to sneak bomb components into 10 federal government buildings. A GAO report cites lax security in federal buildings after investigators got bomb components past guards. The Government Accountability Office, which conducted the tests, testified that they showed the service to be ""an agency in crisis."" Plainclothes investigators testing the effectiveness of private contract guards at federal office buildings were able to smuggle in bomb components in all 10 attempts. Only one investigator was stopped and questioned, but he was allowed to pass with the components of a liquid bomb. Once inside the facilities, the testers assembled the bombs in restrooms, put them in briefcases and ""walked freely"" into government offices, according to the Government Accountability Office.  Watch undercover agent smuggle bomb » . Asked point-blank at a Senate hearing Wednesday why the security guards had failed, Protective Service Director Gary Schenkel said, ""It's purely a lack of oversight on our part."" He added, ""I take full responsibility. I am the director of the organization."" Schenkel, who assumed his post in early 2007, said the police force was hampered earlier this decade by major budget cuts, which forced the agency to reorganize how it protects 9,000 federal facilities nationwide. Although police officers formerly protected federal buildings, the agency now uses a core cadre of 1,200 sworn federal officers or ""inspectors"" to oversee a small army of about 13,000 private security guards who man the X-ray machines and magnetometers at building entrances. Department of Homeland Security put out an official statement Wednesday focusing on steps the Federal Protective Service is taking to improve the situation, but Schenkel was at times more negative, outlining some of the problems the agency faces. The service, he said, used a ""stubby pencil"" system to keep track of guards, and it would take a ""full year, I believe"" for changes being made now to have an effect . ""When I came here, I made an analogy that we were a ship, and it takes 38 miles at sea to turn a ship, an aircraft carrier. I think we are probably on mile six, but we've certainly initiated the turn,"" he said. Mark Goldstein of the Government Accountability Office testified about the investigators' operations. ""We brought in all the components that we needed to make a real bomb,"" he said, though the concentration of explosives was ""below the trigger point"" for safety reasons. Investigators obtained the components at local stores and over the Internet for less than $150, the report says. ""In a number of the locations -- three or four of them -- the guards were not even looking at the screens that would show materials passing through,"" Goldstein said. ""If a guard had been looking, they would have seen materials that are ordinarily not brought into a federal building, and should have stopped our investigators and asked, 'Why are you bringing these kinds of things into a fed building, and what is your purpose?' But in really no case did that occur. ""In only one instance did a guard ask about something that an investigator was carrying, [and] after a brief explanation, that guard let it go through,"" Goldstein said. The covert agents then assembled bombs in the bathrooms, he said. ""In some cases, bathrooms were locked, but federal employees let us in,"" he said. Having assembled the bomb, typically in less than four minutes, the agents placed it an a briefcase ""and walked around a variety of federal offices -- both legislative branch offices and executive branch offices in the four cities we went to,"" Goldstein said. He blamed the lapses on an ""antiquated approach"" to security, saying federal building security is directed in part by the buildings' tenants, who form a committee to determine the appropriate level of security. So decisions are made ""by people who, frankly, ought not be making them,"" he said. He also said security is ""budget-driven; it's not risk-driven."" But he shied away from recommending that the contract security jobs be federalized, a move the government took for airport security screeners following the September 11 terrorist attacks. That would be a policy decision, he said. But he said the Protective Service was lax in assuring that security standards it set were followed by the private contract guards. Of 663 randomly selected guards, 411, or 62 percent, were missing some form of required certification, such as an up-to-date firearm qualification, background investigation or CPR or first aid training. Included in the Government Accountability Office report is a photograph of a guard asleep at his post. The report also detailed an instance in which a woman placed an infant in a carrier on an X-ray machine while retrieving identification. Because the guard was not paying attention and the machine's safety features had been disabled, the infant was sent through the X-ray machine, according to the report. The Protective Service dismissed the guard, who sued the agency for failing to provide X-ray training. The agency lost the suit because it could not prove that the guard had been trained, the report says. In one region, the service ""has not provided the required eight hours of [X-ray] or magnetometer training to its 1,500 guards since 2004,"" the report says. It report also says the service does not have a national guidance on how often its inspectors should check on the contract guards. In several instances, when inspectors have checked on guards, they found ""instances of guards not complying with post orders."" In one case, the report says, a guard was caught using government computers to manage a for-profit adult Web site. All of the buildings involved in the bomb smuggling test were ""Level IV"" buildings, meaning they house more than 450 federal employees and have a high volume of public contact. The Government Accountability Office has declined to identify the specific buildings ""because of the sensitivity of some of the information,"" the report says. After the report was obtained by CNN late Tuesday, ahead of its release Wednesday, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Connecticut, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, called the test results ""simply unacceptable."" Added Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, ""In this post-9/11 world that we're now living in, I can not imagine how security lapses of this magnitude were allowed to occur. "" Both Lieberman and Collins said they were putting the Federal Protective Service on a list of ""high-risk"" agencies and asked Schenkel to provide them with details of how he would fix the security lapses. Although the investigators ensured that bombs assembled in the buildings would not explode, they later videotaped the detonation of several of the devices at a remote site to demonstrate the their destructive power.","Report questions effectiveness of Federal Protective Service .

"I know what you're thinking: What do Justin Timberlake and I have in common? First, we're both responsible for bringing sexy back. Second, we're both standing up to cancer on Friday. Why? Well, I don't know Justin's connection to cancer, but I do know mine. I lost both of my grandfathers, an uncle and numerous friends to cancer. Additionally, my mother is a cancer survivor. (First, uterine cancer, and then kidney cancer.) And I know that all the stars who are coming out Friday night and all the viewers at home have been personally touched by cancer in some way. They've seen the havoc the disease can wreak on a person's life, family, friends and immune system. No matter who you are, how wealthy you are, how famous you are, cancer will find a way into your life, affecting you or someone you love. Every day, 1,600 Americans die from cancer. Eight million people worldwide will die this year from the disease.  In the U.S., one in every two men and one out of every three women will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetimes. Stand Up to Cancer is a movement designed to get top researchers from the best medical centers focused on highly specialized projects aimed at bringing new treatments to people faster and making everyone diagnosed with cancer a survivor. We're gearing up for a national election, yet it's rare to hear leaders from either major political party say anything about cancer. We, the people, must.  It's why for years now, I've ""spontaneously"" showed up at baseball games and other events to support cancer research and on the Friday after Labor Day, I put on one of those fancy T-shirts and stand up to cancer with my friends from film, TV, music and sports. Say what you want about the entertainment industry (and, really, what hasn't been said?) but on this one, we're getting it right. For all the issues and problems facing us all right now, this is one of the most pressing. It's also one of the most promising. Scientists and doctors are genuinely excited about the progress in the fight against the disease. Certain cancers have higher survival rates than others. By having dedicated dream teams of scientists collaborating in an unprecedented manner and studying the connections between certain types of cancers, those kinds of cancer with lower survival rates have been put on notice. (That's right, pancreatic cancer, your days are numbered.) During Friday's broadcast, you will hear first-hand from patients bravely participating in clinical trials and scientists on the front lines of the war against the disease, and your favorite movie stars will share stories of real people, just like my mom, who went through hell and back because of cancer. But after all, we are the entertainment industry, and therefore you will be entertained by the likes of Coldplay, Alicia Keys, Tim McGraw and Taylor Swift. (I personally picked the music. You're welcome.) But even with an incredible lineup of stars that includes Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Samuel L. Jackson, one of our executive producers Gwyneth Paltrow and America's newest sweethearts, Olympic gold medalists Gabrielle Douglas and Missy Franklin, there will still be cynics out there. From the hopeless: ""Cancer will never be cured. Why bother?"" To the apathetic: ""The war on cancer is decades old. Why bother?"" To those whose sole purpose in life is to point fingers: ""Cancer is all a matter of lifestyle. Why bother?"" To the conspiracy theorists: ""The drug companies don't really want a cure for cancer. Why bother?"" To these people, I say, ""Stand Up. And stand up now."" We have been finding cures for diseases since the beginning of time. Polio was decades old before the March of Dimes movement, initially broadcast on radio, galvanized a country to find a cure. To those who think cancer is solely a byproduct of unhealthy living, I say healthy people get cancer, too. And to those conspiracy theorists out there, I am reminded of something Stand Up to Cancer's co-founder Laura Ziskin used to say: ""The people who work at drug companies get cancer, too. So do their mothers, wives, husbands, sons and daughters. They want it to end, like the rest of us."" So now is our time. This is our movement. Pull up a chair (I recommend bringing a box of Kleenex or two with you), turn on just about any channel on TV Friday night and at some point go to su2c.org and give what you can. Stand Up. So that one day your grandkids or your great-grandkids will ask you, ""What is cancer?"" And you'll proudly say, ""Something of the past. And boy, 'Modern Family' was a helluva show.""

"Take a look at ingredients for some varieties of Subway's bread and you'll find a chemical that may seem unfamiliar and hard to pronounce: azodicarbonamide. To say this word, you would emphasize the syllable ""bon"" -- but the attention the chemical has been getting has not been good. Besides bread, the chemical is also found in yoga mats and shoe soles to add elasticity. But it's not long for bread at Subway: The company says it's coming out. ""Even though this ingredient is safe, we are removing it from Subway bread. This process began last year and is nearly completed -- we have already developed an improved bread formula, conducted extensive performance and consumer testing on it, and pending final government approvals we should complete the entire conversion process within the coming weeks,"" Subway said in a statement. Subway said azodicarbonamide is ""an extremely common bread ingredient that is fully approved and recognized as safe by the FDA."" The controversial chemical has been used by commercial bakers for the purpose of strengthening dough but has been poorly tested, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. One of the breakdown products, derived from the original substance, is called urethane, a recognized carcinogen, the organization says. Using azodicarbonamide at maximum allowable levels results in higher levels of urethane in bread ""that pose a small risk to humans,"" CSPI said. Another breakdown product is semicarbazide, which poses ""a negligible risk to humans"" but was found to cause cancers of the lung and blood vessels in mice, CSPI said. CSPI advocates for reducing the amount of the chemical that is allowed to be used. ""We urge the Food and Drug Administration to consider whether the Delaney amendment, which bars the use of food additives that cause cancer in humans or animals, requires the agency to bar its use,"" CSPI said. The FDA has said that the additive cannot exceed 0.0045% by weight of the flour when used in as a ""dough conditioner."" The American Bakers Association told CNN: ""Past FDA sampling results have indicated appropriate low level use in products. As a dough conditioner it has a volume/texture effect on the finished loaf. It is a functional ingredient that improves the quality of bread and any substitutes are likely not to work as well as ADA (azodicarbonamide)."" Food blogger Vani Hari, of the popular food blog Food Babe, originally drew public attention to this issue, CSPI said. She has written about Subway ingredients several times since 2012, this week she launched a petition urging Subway to stop using azodicarbonamide. More than 67,000 people signed. Grocery store breads and restaurant breads also contain this chemical. Other major fast food chains have products with the ingredient too, including McDonald's, Starbucks and Arby's. McDonald's has also responded to concerns about the chemical with regard to its McRib sandwich buns, but continues to use the chemical in that product. McDonald's notes on its website that a ""variation of Azodicarbonamide has commercial uses and is used in the production of some foamed plastics, like exercise mats. But this shouldn't be confused with the food-grade variation of this ingredient."" Azodicarbonamide is not legally allowed to be used as a dough improver in the European Union, according to the European Food Safety Authority. It is also banned in Australia. A 1999 report from an international group of health experts, published by the World Health Organization, says some studies suggest that the chemical can induce asthma, based on evidence from people with symptoms and employees of facilities where the chemical is manufactured or used. But use of the chemical in the workplace is very different, and carries much greater exposure than eating a tiny amount in bread. The report notes that the concentration required to produce asthmatic reactions is unknown. ""The level of risk is uncertain; hence, exposure levels should be reduced as much as possible,"" WHO said.","Azodicarbonamide is a chemical found in yoga mats and shoe soles .

"So it looks like Michael Dunn, a white man who fatally shot black teenager Jordan Davis for refusing to turn down his ""thug music,"" may be going to prison for the rest of his life. But that's a consolation prize. Not a real victory. It's not a real victory because the jury that convicted Dunn, 47, didn't convict him for killing the 17-year-old Davis. They convicted him for almost killing Davis' three friends who were riding in the Dodge Durango with him. They found Dunn guilty of three counts of second-degree attempted murder and one count of shooting deadly missiles. Each attempted murder count carries a minimum sentence of 20 years. But it's a hollow victory. It's hollow because it means that, in 21st century America, the notion that a mouthy young black male could be a threat carries more weight with some people than the fact that an impulsive middle-aged white man could be a liar. Think about it. Apparently someone on the Dunn jury -- a jury that took four days to deadlock on whether Dunn was justified in killing Davis -- believed that Davis' cursing at Dunn and arguing over the volume of his music equaled a serious enough threat to make Dunn reasonably fear for his life. Gunman 'in disbelief' over loud-music verdict . Someone on that jury saw Davis with a shotgun that likely never existed, but didn't see the real bullets -- 10 in all -- that Dunn pumped into the SUV and into Davis' body, bullets that left Davis bleeding and dying in his friend's lap. It's hollow because it underscores what seems to be a scary trend. I guess now any random white man can confront a black teenager whose style of dress or music he doesn't like or views as suspect.  And when that teenager doesn't submit to him, or responds to him in a confrontational manner, or in a way that any rebellious teenager is apt to respond, then it's perfectly fine to exterminate him. See evidence in case . We first saw this with Trayvon Martin. Martin was walking to his father's home when George Zimmerman took it upon himself to follow him because he was wearing a hoodie. Yet just as Zimmerman thought Martin looked suspicious, the 17-year-old thought Zimmerman looked suspicious. But when Martin responded to Zimmerman's stalking and wound up in a fight with him, Zimmerman fatally shot him. And he got away with it. Zimmerman claimed self-defense. In a confrontation that he provoked. So did Dunn with Davis. Dunn took it upon himself to drive up to a convenience store in Jacksonville and, even with a number of empty spaces available, decide to park next to the one vehicle full of young black men playing some thumping hip-hop music. Rather than avoid music he hated, he parked right next to it. And when Davis didn't submit to his wishes to turn it down, he didn't like it. They had words. He didn't like that. Michael Dunn was not going to be sassed by a black kid. So Dunn reached into his glove compartment, pulled out his 9 mm handgun and started shooting at Davis and his friends. And he killed him. Verdict evokes mixed reactions . Yet this jury believed that the unarmed black teenager, Jordan Davis, was so scary, so profane that they couldn't see their way to convict Dunn of murdering him. So even though Dunn is going to prison, it's tough to feel good about the verdict. It feels hollow. What the verdict says is that in this nation, in the 21st century, some white men still believe they have the right to intrude into the space of young black men and make demands. And if the black man is unarmed -- with no weapon except his words -- those white men can still kill him. And call it self-defense. All they need is a jury to buy it.","Tonyaa Weathersbee calls the verdict in the Michael Dunn murder case a hollow victory .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two federal officials admitted Tuesday they made ""mistakes"" during the controversial Operation Fast and Furious gunrunner program, but they disputed contentions by a parade of other agents that their bureau knowingly let guns ""walk"" into Mexico. ""It was not the purpose of the investigation to permit the transportation of firearms into Mexico,"" said William Newell, former special agent in charge of the Phoenix field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ""To the best of my knowledge none of the suspects in this case was ever witnessed by our agents crossing the border with firearms."" Newell's insistence that guns were not allowed to cross the border drew an angry rebuke from Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House committee investigating the program, who called Newell a ""paid non-answerer"" at Tuesday's hearing. ""Are they (the other agents) lying, or are you lying?"" Issa asked Newell. ""We did not let guns walk,"" Newell responded. ""You're entitled to your opinion, not to your facts,"" Issa said. Newell and William McMahon, the head of western field operations for ATF, both painted themselves as dedicated public servants whose only goal was to help dismantled drug cartels that were benefiting from the free flow of weapons from the United States to Mexico. Both testified previous tactics aimed at catching and prosecuting gun smugglers were ineffective, and Newell said Operation Fast and Furious was ""innovative."" He said he ""made every reasonable effort"" to keep his ATF colleagues in Mexico briefed about the investigation. Newell said he should have pressed for quicker action by prosecutors, and should have conducted ""more frequent risk assessments."" McMahon said his support for the program was based partly on his experience as assistant special agent in charge of the ATF's World Trade Center office on September 11, 2001, which added to his ""zeal"" to bring down complex criminal networks. But with ""the advantage of hindsight ... I would have done (things) differently,"" McMahon said. Asked for one example of a mistake, he said he should have more thoroughly reviewed investigative documents that crossed his desk. Both McMahon and Newell testified Tuesday at the hearing of a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. At the hearing, several ATF agents testified the tactic of allowing guns to ""walk"" was ill-considered and violated long-established ATF policies and practices. They also said the ATF failed to inform Mexican authorities of the program, or to even notify U.S. officials in Mexico. The tactic ""is insane,"" said Carlos Canino, acting ATF attache to Mexico. ""I can say with authority 'walking guns' is not a recognized investigative technique,"" Canino testified. ""These guns went to ruthless criminals. ... It infuriates me that people, including my law enforcement, diplomatic and military colleagues, may be killed or injured with these weapons."" Canino said Mexican officials regularly complain about American indifference to Mexican violence and death, a view he does not share. ""However, in this particular case, with these specific guns, I am unable to defend this operation."" The former ATF attache to Mexico shared that sentiment. ""I would like to apologize to my former Mexican law enforcement counterparts and to the Mexican people for Operation Fast and Furious,"" said Darren Gil. ""I hope they understand that this was kept secret from most of ATF, including me and my colleagues in Mexico."" At the opening of the hearing, Issa, R-California, accused the Obama administration of stonewalling the investigation, saying the Department of Justice continues to withhold information and has ""inappropriately interfered"" with the committee's work. ""Let me be clear: the Justice Department is not our partner in this effort. They are the subject of this investigation and their continued interference will not be allowed to derail the committee's work,"" Issa said. Issa said the Justice Department has blocked efforts to identify those inside the department who were aware of the program, and who endorsed it. ""We have not yet seen the end of the violence from operation Fast and Furious. The deadly consequences of this irresponsible program could last for years to come,"" Issa said. ""Today the committee estimates at least 1,600 weapons, including .50 caliber sniper rifles, are still out there waiting to kill. The possibility that administration officials, perhaps at the highest level of the Justice Department, approved this strategy and are now trying to cover up their own involvement by stonewalling the committee (is) alarming,"" he said. The Justice Department refutes claims by Issa that it refused to cooperate with the congressional investigation and is ""pushing away"" investigators from senior political appointees at the department. ""Ridiculous. Simply not true,"" said Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler. ""We have provided thousands of documents, interviews, and testimony."" But Schmaler was critical of a committee report on the matter, saying it ""promotes unsubstantiated theories by selectively releasing excerpts of transcripts while ignoring testimony and other information."" ""For whatever reason, the leadership of the committee chose not to release witness testimony that makes clear that operational details relating to this investigation were unknown to senior Department of Justice officials,"" she said. ""The department, like the committee, is interested in getting to the bottom of the concerns raised by ATF agents about this operation, which is why the attorney general has asked the inspector general to investigate the matter. The department continues to cooperate with the investigation, but the committee must be willing to share all of the facts.""

"The purse was by designer Baby Phat, and it was only $5. But when Elizabeth Deiter bought it at the thrift store where she works, she immediately had to run over to the bank and deposit money to avoid running a negative balance. She and her husband only recently caught up on their rent, after four or five months, and Deiter has close to 100 purses already, but she still went for the bargain. In thinking about this and other splurges on things she didn't need, Deiter has begun to consider herself a compulsive shopper. ""I am ashamed of it,"" says Deiter, 22, of Reading, Pennsylvania. ""I've screwed up a lot. I know I should stop."" With holiday season discounts running rampant online and in stores, it's especially easy to fall into the trap of overspending this month, especially if you have a problem with impulse control at the mall. But beyond carelessness with finances, compulsive shopping is a mental disorder that psychologists recognize, although it has not been studied extensively. For compulsive shoppers, buying something creates a feeling related to the euphoria that alcohol induces, said Bonny Forrest, a psychologist in San Diego.  As with alcoholics, it's hard to keep away from that rush of pleasure. About 6% of women and 5.5% of men are compulsive buyers, according to a 2006 study from Stanford University in the American Journal of Psychiatry. The mental disorder has not been studied extensively, but it is thought to be an impulse control disorder. April Lane Benson, New York psychologist and author of ""To Buy or Not to Buy: Why We Overshop and How to Stop,"" estimates that between one third and one half of compulsive buyers eventually turn into hoarders, but some just buy a lot of items and get rid of the old ones. Where does compulsive shopping come from? Sometimes, people acquire objects as a way of dealing with chaos and feeling out of control, Benson said. ""You buy something, you're in control of it,"" she said. It may also be related to childhood. Parents may have given presents instead of time and attention, leading a child to grow up wanting to get more material possessions. Other people may have grown up with a lot of emotional or financial deprivation, and when they're able to afford shopping for themselves, they overbuy as a way of not going back to the way things were. Another theory is that ""we buy as a way of trying to deal with our fears of death and the inevitability of death,"" Benson said. Compulsive shopping sometimes goes hand in hand with alcoholism and eating disorders, Forrest said. It's not currently a separate diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the ""Bible"" by which mental health professionals identify conditions. Psychologists usually view it as an issue of impulse control rather than a sign of obsessive-compulsive disorder; OCD medications do not tend to work for shopping problems, Forrest said. There's no hard line between treating yourself to a pair of shoes on a bad day and being a compulsive shopper -- it is a spectrum. When shopping causes distress in your relationship or if shopping is the only way you can deal with negative feelings, it can be a real problem, Forrest says. Compulsive shoppers might have continued arguments with their spouses over money and can't afford basic necessities, she said. Deiter can relate to this. ""When I'm upset, it happens more often. I get into an argument with my husband or my day is not going right, I definitely spend more,"" Deiter said. When her husband asks her what happened to the other $400 that was supposed to be in their bank account, she honestly doesn't know -- she doesn't remember what she spent it all on. And she says her husband has threatened to end the marriage if her spending puts them behind in the bills again. Shopping addicts are especially vulnerable right now because retailers play up the hysteria of limited chances at bargain prices. Someone with feelings of low self-esteem might equate having a good holiday with buying things. Especially given the slumping economy of the past few years, consumers are made to feel that, with regard to making certain purchases, it's now or never. ""Think of a car's brakes. If you don't have brake fluid you can't stop,"" Forrest says. ""With the impulse to gamble, drink, shop, you can't put the brakes on."" Deiter remembers her buying habits started small, with snacks. Then she moved on to Five and Below, which she thought would be cheap, but ended up spending $140 at once there. Two months ago, she bought $80 worth of beads to make jewelry; the beads are still in a box. ""I always end up finding a way to pay the bills,"" she said. ""Then, I'll fall into old patterns."" Deiter learned about the phenomenon through the movie ""Confessions of a Shopaholic,"" but she only stopped to think about herself that way a couple months ago. She has joined an online support group, but the meetings happen while she's at work, and she doesn't have enough money for a therapist. She hasn't found any meetings in her area, either.  She wrote about her problem on the blog Secret Regrets. One strategy that helps some compulsive shoppers curb their habits is to pay in cash, so they see how much they're spending, Forrest said. They also can try going shopping with other people who can act as a check, making sure they don't overspend. Online, they might want to avoid storing credit card information, so that it's harder to make a purchase before thinking about it. Forrest recommends waiting 24 hours before actually buying something you don't really need, to give yourself time to reconsider. Another source of help might be an online support group, such as Debtors Anonymous. Benson has a whole program planned out for compulsive shoppers. It begins with examining why they impulsively overshop and what are triggers and consequences of that behavior. She helps her clients examine the costs and benefits of spending in this way, . ""I have them really think through the vision of what they want to be true in their lives, so that they can project ahead and see whether the way they're living their lives now is likely to get them to where they want to be,"" Benson said. Motivation to change comes from recognizing the disconnect between who they want to be and who they are right now, Benson said. She then takes them through the nitty-gritty of finances: How much did they spend and how much did they want to spend? How much could they have saved by not buying so much? This is a nine-week process. Clients also create a ""shopping self-portrait,"" in which they envision themselves buying something they later regretted purchasing. What needs are they fulfilling by shopping? Love and affection, belonging, self-esteem, the esteem of others, and autonomy are all needs that the client may wish to consider fulfilling in different ways, instead of going to the mall. ""The underlying rubric of the whole thing is to really get in touch with what it is you really need, and how to get that,"" Benson said. ""It's not that sixth pair of black boots.""","About 6% of women and 5.5% of men are compulsive buyers .

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly a billion people worldwide have limited access to clean water, the State Department says, and the crisis disproportionately affects women and girls. ""On average, women in developing countries walk 6 kilometers a day to collect water"" because there is not enough of it nearby, Undersecretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs Maria Otero told CNN. The chore keeps girls out of school and women from more productive economic activities, Otero said. Otero spoke at a Washington, D.C., event Wednesday organized to bring awareness to the issue. Several hundred people gathered outside the State Department for the ""Earth Day 6K Walk for Water,"" a 3.5-mile walk around the city to support the many women who have to carry containers on long treks every day to fetch water for their families. Nearly 1 billion people in the developing world walk on average 3.5 miles to get water to drink. The United Nations' refugee agency estimates that more than half of the world's refugee camps don't have the recommended minimum daily water requirement of 20 liters per person, and about 30% of camps don't have adequate waste disposal and latrine facilities, according to its website. Elynn Walter, the sustainability director with the Washington-based WASH Advocacy Initiative, which works to raise and funds and awareness to address the problem, said women in many developing countries are expected to supply water while men tend to other chores. Walter stood before two large containers called jerry cans commonly used in third-world countries to carry water collected from far-away locations. When filled, she said the cans weigh a hefty 55 pounds. ""They often put it on their shoulder and carry it above their head,"" Walter told CNN. Rachel Schneller, a foreign service officer who lived for two years in Mali in the mid-1990s as a Peace Corps volunteer, said she joined the walk to raise awareness about the problem. She lived in a village in a nut hut in Mali, with a grass roof, no running water and no electricity. She said she carried her water in a jerry can. ""When you need that water to do everything from washing your body, brushing your teeth, cooking your meals, washing your clothes, water for bathing ... you count every single drop, Schneller said. ""You realize how important water is, especially if you're the one that has to go collect it and bring it back-- every single drop."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has elevated water to one of her key issues, providing $770 million through USAID in 2009 toward increasing access to water and sanitation, particularly for people living in developing countries. Otero said water problems are not limited to the third world, however. Every region of the world is affected, including the United States, especially in the Southwest. Water scarcity has even become a security consideration, she said. ""Wars can start, conflict can start, tension can happen, and being able to help countries manage this and address it in a collaborative way is part of our effort in working this,"" Otero said. CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","Nearly a billion people worldwide have limited access to clean water .
