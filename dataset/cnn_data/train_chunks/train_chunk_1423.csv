"Transgender military personnel from 18 countries across the world gathered today to talk about their experiences and discuss whether the US military could join them. The conference attendees, who are all from militaries that allow transgender service, gathered in Washington, DC. The gathering, Perspectives on Transgender Military Service from Around the Globe, is the first-ever and largest international conference of transgender military service members on US soil. Transgender Major Alexandra Larsson of the Swedish Armed Forces speaks during a conference entitled 'Perspectives on Transgender Military Service from Around the Globe' The conference was organized by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Palm Center in Washington . The conference included currently serving transgender personnel from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden. An estimated 15,500 transgender individuals currently serve in the US military, but they are banned by Pentagon rules from serving, and if their identity is discovered, the military is required to discharge them. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) supports the elimination of rules that ban transgender people from openly serving in the military, her office told the Washington Blade. Drew Hammill, a Pelosi spokesperson, told the Blade on Friday she believes gender identity should not be a factor in prohibiting Americans from serving in the military. 'Leader Pelosi believes there is no place for discrimination in the U.S. Armed Forces, including on the basis of gender identity,' Hammill said. Earlier this year a report found there is 'no compelling medical reason' for U.S. armed forced to ban transgender Americans from serving.

Transgender military personnel from 18 countries who allow them to serve openly, gathered to talk about their experiences . They also discussed at the conference whether the US military could join them . Earlier this year a report found there is 'no compelling medical reason' for U.S. armed forced to ban transgender Americans from serving . The independent commission led by a former U.S. surgeon general also concluded that President Obama could lift the decades-old ban without approval from Congress. About 15,500 transgender personnel are currently serving, nearly all under their birth genders and not transitioning in an appearance-altering way, according to the Williams Institute, a think tank. Dr. Joycelyn Elders, who served as surgeon general during Bill Clinton's first term as president, and Rear Adm. Alan Steinman, a former chief health and safety director for the Coast Guard, led the report that was released on Thursday. 'We determined not only that there is no compelling medical reason for the ban, but also that the ban itself is an expensive, damaging and unfair barrier to health care access for the approximately 15,450 transgender personnel who serve currently in the active, Guard and reserve components,' it said. The panel, convened by a think tank at San Francisco State University, said the ban has existed for several decades and apparently was derived in part from the psychiatric establishment's consensus, since revised, that gender identity issues amounted to a mental disorder.

The ban also appears based on the assumption that providing hormone treatment and sex reassignment surgeries would be too difficult, disruptive and expensive . Transgender Major Alexandra Larsson of the Swedish Armed Forces speaks at the conference . The ban also appears based on the assumption that providing hormone treatment and sex reassignment surgeries would be too difficult, disruptive and expensive. But the commission rejected those notions as inconsistent with modern medical practice and the scope of health care services routinely provided to non-transgender military personnel. 'I hope their takeaway will be we should evaluate every one of our people on the basis of their ability and what they can do, and if they have a condition we can treat we would treat it like we would treat anyone else,' Elders said in an interview with The Associated Press. At least a dozen nations, including Australia, Canada, England and Israel, allow military service by transgender individuals. Transgender rights advocates have been lobbying the Pentagon to revisit the blanket ban in the U.S. since Congress in 2010 repealed the law that barred gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals from openly serving in the military . The commission argued that facilitating gender transitions 'would place almost no burden on the military,' adding that a relatively small number of active and reserve service members would elect to undergo transition-related surgeries and that only a fraction might suffer complications that would prevent them from serving. It estimated that 230 transgender people a year would seek such surgery at an average cost of about $30,000. Retired Brigadier General Thomas Kolditz, a former Army commander and West Point professor on the commission, said he thinks allowing transgender people to serve openly would reduce gender-based harassment, assaults and suicides while enhancing national security. But Center for Military Readiness President Elaine Donnelly, whose group opposed the repeal of the ban on openly gay troops, predicted that putting transgender people in barracks, showers and other sex-segregated could cause sexual assaults to increase and infringe on the privacy of non-transgender personnel. 'This is putting an extra burden on men and women in the military that they certainly don't need and they don't deserve,' Donnelly said.","The conference attendees gathered in Washington, DC on Monday .

"A shocking video that appears to show Libyan rebels torturing a group of sub-Saharan African detainees has appeared on YouTube. The footage shows a dozen or so men - suspected by Libyan rebels of fighting for the toppled government of Muammur Gaddafi last year - held in what looks like a caged zoo enclosure. They each have their hands tied behind their back and are sat on the cage's dirty floor. More objectionably, each has the old Libyan flag stuffed into his mouth. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Video footage that appears to show Libyan rebels torturing a group of sub-Saharan African detainees has appeared on YouTube . Prisoners: The footage shows a dozen or so men held in what looks like a caged zoo enclosure, with their hands tied behind their backs and the former Libyan flag in their mouths . While a crowd of men gather round the enclosure jeering, their prisoners are made to hop on the spot. The man filming the scene, who remains . off-camera, can be heard shouting: 'Eat the flag, you dog. Patience you . dog, patience. God is great.' It is impossible to verify whether the video, which was leaked onto YouTube last week, is genuine and where and when it was filmed. It has emerged as the UN this week . said that the Libyan revolutionary brigades accused of torture still . hold captive three-quarters of detainees from the country's civil war. A lack of judicial police has prevented the government from taking control of more jails, the UN said on Wednesday. Up to 6,000 detainees are estimated to . remain in brigade facilities, while the Ministry of Justice has taken . charge of eight detention centres holding 2,382 people. The figures were revealed to the UN Security Council by Ian Martin, the UN special envoy for Libya. Many of the detainees are sub-Saharan . Africans whom their captors accused of being Gaddafi mercenaries, based . in some cases purely on the fact that they have darker skin. Jeered: The men are suspected of fighting for the toppled government of Muammur Gaddafi last year . Humiliating: While a crowd of men gather round the enclosure shouting, their prisoners are made to hop on the spot . The UN human rights agency and aid groups have accused the brigades of torturing detainees during Libya's nine-month civil war. Mr Martin has urged the Ministry of Justice to accelerate the process of asserting government control over detention centres. But he said: 'Progress continues to be complicated by insufficient numbers of judicial police.' He added: 'We will continue to work . closely with the authorities and to encourage them to ensure that . inspections of known facilities are undertaken, that secret locations . are identified and brought under government control, and that abuses are . investigated.' Accusations of the mistreatment and . disappearances of suspected Gaddafi loyalists are embarrassing for . Libya's ruling National Transitional Council, which has vowed to make a . break with practices under Gaddafi and respect human rights. It is also awkward for the Western powers which backed the anti-Gaddafi rebellion and helped install Libya's new leaders. The UN Security Council meets in New York on Wednesday. It heard that up to 6,000 detainees are estimated to remain in Libyan brigade facilities . Racism? Rebel fighters hold captive a sub-Saharan African man . Out of control: Rebel fighters question another sub-Saharan as they search for Gaddafi army soldiers in Tripoli in August . Gaddafi's 42-year rule collapsed when . his forces fled Tripoli in August, and the last of the fighting in Libya . ended in October when he was captured and killed by rebels. Libyan Ambassador Abdurrahman Mohamed . Shalgham told the UN Security Council that detainees held by the . government, including a number of former Gaddafi ministers and senior . officers, were treated well. Mr Shalgham said: 'However, let me say . that there are areas where the state has not been able to control. There is not police or courts in those areas. 'We cannot be responsible for all . excesses everywhere. We are against them, we object to them and we hold . the perpetrators of such acts responsible.' Mr Martin said that while the armed . brigades lacked clear lines of command and coordination, they continued . to perform important security functions often for long periods without . payment. He said: 'Contrary to the impression . given by some media reports, although they seek guarantees that the . transformation for which they have fought is securely on track, there is . little indication that they wish to perpetuate an existence outside . state authority.'",Footage of captured detainees suspected of fighting for Gaddafi regime is posted on YouTube .
"Veteran television actor Stephen Collins is being investigated by Los Angeles sheriff's detectives after a woman reported the former '7th Heaven' star exposed himself to her in the early 1980s. The department on Wednesday confirmed it opened an investigation on Oct. 9 after the woman reported the incident to authorities. The alleged victim was 13 years old when she claims Collins exposed himself to her in West Hollywood, California, in 1983. Special Victims Unit detectives are investigating the actor for indecent exposure and whether he annoyed or molested a child, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said in a news release. The woman reported the incident two days after New York police confirmed they had an open investigation into decades-old allegations that Collins molested a family acquaintance in Manhattan in the early 1970s. The revelation came after celebrity news site TMZ disclosed the investigation. Scroll down for video . Investigated: A woman told authorities former '7th Heaven' star Stephen Collins exposed himself to her when she was 13 years old in1983 . Divorcing: Faye Grant, seen with Collins,  included allegations that her husband molested underage girls in court filings in their ongoing divorce . The alleged victim was related to one of Collins' Havenhurst Drive neighbors, law enforcement sources told TMZ. That would coincide with information from Lt. Steve Katz, who told the Los Angeles Times activity at an apartment complex on the street is being reviewed. A voice that appears to be Collins's mentions in an audio tape -  secretly made by wife Faye Grant during a marriage therapy session and obtained by TMZ - a  third victim, who he says 'was the niece of the woman who lived across the way. At [redacted]. 'She is someone I actually saw about 12 or 15 years ago I made an amends to,' he continues. Collins' attorney, Mark Vincent Kaplan, did not immediately return phone or email messages from The Associated Press. Collins, 67, has not been charged in Los Angeles or New York. Faye Grant included allegations that her husband molested underage girls in court filings in their ongoing divorce. Collins filed to divorce his wife in 2012, and a trial to divide the pair's assets is scheduled for next month. Within hours of TMZ posting its story, two networks announced they were canceling scheduled re-runs of '7th Heaven,' and Collins lost roles in the upcoming film 'Ted 2' and this season of the ABC series 'Scandal.' MailOnline earlier reported that it obtained divorce files, in which Grant said 'Obviously I am sickened by Stephen's actions. I have urged Stephen multiple times to seek proper treatment for pedophilia. 'I am particularly afraid of what may happen if he does not seek treatment, because he may be working or interacting with children in connection with his employment.' Grant wrote in a sworn court declaration in Los Angeles last year that her husband had disclosed he molested at least three young girls. She wrote that she reported the alleged abuse to Los Angeles police, who have said they are not actively investigating the actor. Fallout: Two networks have announced they were canceling scheduled re-runs of '7th Heaven,' and Collins lost roles in the upcoming film 'Ted 2' and this season of the ABC series 'Scandal' Television star: Stephen Collins played the Rev. Eric Camden in the WB family drama '7th Heaven' 'Stephen admitted that he has engaged in a long-term pattern of sexually abusing minor children, including sexually molesting three young girls over a decade ago,' Grant wrote in the sworn declaration, which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in November. Kaplan, Collins' attorney, has declined to discuss specifics about the claims, but he has described the accusations as an attempt by Grant to obtain a more favorable settlement of the couple's divorce. The filings do not include a denial of the molestation allegations, but attack Grant's use of them as 'an attempt to extort concessions in settlement' from Collins. Grant said in a statement last week that was not trying to obtain an undue advantage in the divorce proceedings. 'This is a deeply sad situation for everyone involved,' Grant wrote. 'With regard to the divorce proceedings, I am seeking no more than that to which I am legally entitled under the laws of the State of California.' Collins has worked steadily in television and movie roles since the early 1970s, with appearances in movies such as 'All the President's Men,' 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' and recurring roles on series such as 'No Ordinary Family,' 'Revolution' and 'Devious Maids' after '7th Heaven' concluded its 11-season run in 2007.

"Unknown: The ritually slaughtered meat could be present the non-Jewish market as well . Beef and lamb from animals killed in ‘cruel’ ritual ceremonies are being sold in mainstream butchers, restaurants and supermarkets across Britain, The Mail on Sunday has found. Our investigation has discovered that kosher meat – which is slaughtered in accordance with strict Jewish food preparation rules –  is being sold as ordinary fresh  beef and lamb, or ending up in ready-made meals and burgers. The Jewish ‘shechita’ method of slaughter – the practice of slitting an animal’s throat and allowing it to bleed to death – has been slammed as ‘inhumane’ by vets and animal rights groups because the creature is conscious when it happens. Jewish law governing shechita strictly forbids pre-stunning,  as do some Islamic groups for  the production of halal meat. However, recent research suggests that unstunned animals can feel pain for up to two minutes. In conventional methods of slaughter, animals are rendered unconscious with an electric shock before their throats are slit or they are shot. Jews who observe strict kosher rules also eat only the front part of  a cow or sheep because the rump  and hind-quarters are deemed ‘unholy’. But the MoS can reveal that a number of abattoirs in the UK and Ireland that practise shechita are selling these ‘unholy’ parts to British suppliers and retailers, including supermarkets and butchers. As a result, many consumers are buying their meat unaware of how it was produced. Although the number of animals killed in the UK under shechita rules is not known, Compassion In World Farming, which campaigns for humane slaughter methods, claims 1.4 million sheep and goats, 32 million chickens and 70,000 cattle are slaughtered for meat without being stunned first. Experts say meat from an equal number of animals killed by similar methods in Ireland finds its way into the UK, one the biggest markets for Irish abattoirs and suppliers. 'Unholy': The parts marked with an 'X' are potentially making their way into the food chain . John Murphy, international sales director of Liffey Meats in Co. Cavan – one of Ireland’s biggest abattoirs – said all leftovers from its shechita slaughter is sold to mainstream suppliers in both Ireland and the UK. The firm kills about 600 cows a week using the un-stunned method, mainly for the Jewish market. John Mutch, managing director of Mutch Meats, in Witney, Oxfordshire, also admitted that left-over kosher meat ends up in the main food chain. He said: ‘What if we are doing kosher meat? It’s been legalised by the Government. It’s fit to go into the food chain, and we pass it on to lots of outlets. If animals cost £1,200 to £1,400 a piece, providing it’s fit for human consumption, it’s all got to be sold somewhere. Preparation: Animals are usually stunned before being killed for their meat, but Jewish law forbids this . ‘I can’t afford to throw away half of the beast, so it gets sold into the food chain. I have a business to run here.’ Stephen Lomax, a technical and legal adviser at the Association of Independent Meat Suppliers, said: ‘The shechita meat is ending up in the entire Gentile market, without any kind of labelling. 'I know the names of the meat suppliers and even the supermarkets that are selling the meat, but I can’t tell you that because of commercial sensitivity.’ Earlier this month, John Blackwell, chief of the British Veterinary Association, was accused of stoking up anti-Semitism and Islamophobia after claiming the religious slaughter of animals without stunning should be banned because it is cruel. But Shechita UK, which regulates religious slaughter for the Jewish community, insisted that when trained slaughtermen carry out shechita, the animals feel little pain. Spokesman Shimon Cohen said: ‘We too advocate better labelling, but a more comprehensive one. 'Rather than saying just “stunned,” it should say “electrocuted”, “gassed” or “shot with a bolt gun”. Then consumers will be fully informed.’ Celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson also called for clearer labelling. ‘People have a right to know what they are eating,’ he said. ‘I am going to ask my own suppliers next week if any unstunned meat comes into my own restaurants.’","According to Jewish law, animals cannot be stunned during slaughter .
Vets and animal rights groups have attacked the 'inhumane' practice .
Mail on Sunday finds meat butchered for Jewish market is being sold on .
It then ends in the regular food chain alongside normally-slaughtered meat .
Since publication of this article, Shechita UK has asked us to point out that the number of animals slaughtered in the UK each year by shechita is as follows: Poultry 1 million, cattle 20,000, sheep 60,000."
"A woman who says she received explicit photos and messages from a married professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island has apologized for making their alleged correspondences public. John Schindler, a former NSA intelligence and a very public critic of whistle-blower Edward Snowden, was placed on leave on Monday after his flirtatious emails and a racy photo of his penis were posted on Twitter. The woman, who lists her name as Lesley . on Twitter and uses the handle @Currahee88, tweeted on Tuesday that she . was ‘truly sorry’ and that ‘if I could go back and change this I would . do so immediately.’ A woman, known only as Lesley, who says she received explicit photos and messages from John Schindler, pictured, a married professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island has apologized for making their alleged correspondences public . Lesley allegedly gave screenshots of Schindler's intimate messages to @T3H_ARCH3R, a self-described internet troll, who then posted the photos online. Naval War College has said it is investigating Schindler and he has been placed on leave. In her tweets, Lesley also stated that the photo was not unsolicited and that her aim had been to embarrass Schindler and inform his wife. She then deactivated her Twitter account. @T3H_ARCH3R, whose real name is Trent Jensen and who has also deleted his Twitter account, told BuzzFeed that both he and Lesley had received threats since the publication of the photos. Teacher: Schindler is Professor of National Security Affairs at the US Naval War College . ‘I’ve been getting a lot more than her because I’m the one who posted the photos,’ he said. Jensen, who is confident the posts are real, said he wasn’t sure if he regretted posting the photos. ‘[Schindler] is somebody that’s supposed to be instructing our people on how to do things the right way. The information that was presented to me was that she was the victim. It was “Hey I need help.” She reached out to me for help.’ Schindler, who is Professor of National Security Affairs at the college, allegedly captioned the photo of his penis 'Got this?' 'Oh dear... :)' Lesley, the recipient of the sexual snap, allegedly replied. Schindler then allegedly wrote 'Now ya got it...' Suggestive: Professor John Schindler allegedly sent these messages, along with a photo of his penis, to another Twitter user called Lesley . 'Kisses, J': Schindler allegedly wrote this letter in which he writes about looking forward to meeting Lesley, who he calls a 'vixen' The image, along with a screenshot of an email allegedly written by Schindler, were uploaded as part of a series by @T3H_ARCH3R. In . the email allegedly written by Schindler, he said he was looking forward to meeting Lesley, who he called a 'vixen,' while also claiming that he is in a . non-traditional marriage. 'I am married to a very kind and understanding woman, but it's not a marriage in a 'normal' or conventional sense; I won't say more than that now, though I will add that she's...not poor,' he allegedly wrote. Later on, the letter reads 'Suffice it to say I find you immensely engaging and enticing - you occupy my thoughts more than I easily admit, you vixen - and I have no doubt that any meeting in the flesh would be hours of deep talk and more that I would probably not be able to contain my excitement over easily, if at all.' A blogger sent a complaint to the War College's administration - and the college's president, Rear Adm. Walter E. 'Ted' Carter Jr., quickly ordered an investigation. A college spokeswoman said investigators would look into whether the photo could have been falsified. Saying goodbye: Schindler's first sign-off is seen here . Updated: Schindler's goodbye was changed to include much shorter text . Schindler refused to discuss the photo by telephone on Monday, citing legal reasons. He has deleted his Twitter account. Schindler has been critical of leaker Edward Snowden and others and has frequently engaged in heated exchanges with critics on Twitter. On his website, he wrote on Monday that he has been subjected to 'nearly non-stop online harassment and stalking' for the past year and 'things have now taken an ugly, indeed sordid turn.' That post was later replaced with a much shorter statement, telling supporters he is taking a break from social media because of personal issues. Schindler had taught at the college since 2005. He is also a fellow at Boston University, according to its website. He was a senior intelligence analyst with the NSA from 1996 to 2004. The Newport, Rhode Island, college said in a statement it could not comment further to protect the integrity of the investigation. It did not say how long the investigation would take.","A woman who says she received explicit .

"A smoker who switched to e-cigarettes for health reasons has described the horrific moment the device 'nearly blew his legs off'. David Aspinall's e-cigarette left him fighting for his life, after it overheated and exploded - showering his limbs with metal. The 48-year-old, from Wigan, nearly lost his flat in the blaze that followed - and spent nine days in hospital recovering from the ordeal. David Aspinall's e-cigarette overheated and exploded - showering his limbs with shards of metal . The 48-year-old said the device overheated and exploded before sparking a fire which nearly cost him his flat . He said he suffered a huge hole in one leg and a gash in the other. He spent nine days in hospital recovering . He claims that medics likened his injuries to bullet wounds - and says he is lucky to be alive. Mr Aspinall, who may need three years of skin grafts to recover, told The Sun: 'It glowed and burned in my hand. I dropped it and it exploded. 'There was lots of blood, a huge hole in one leg and a gash in the other.' 'It could have blown my head off,' he added. 'The surgeon said it was like someone had used a gun.' Despite his terrible injuries, he managed to stagger to a neighbour, who described the scene as similar to a horror film. As well as his leg, metal from the exploding e-cigarette had embedded itself in much of Mr Aspinall's furniture. Having switched to e-cigarettes for health reasons, he has now reverted to regular tobacco, branding it 'safer'. He claims the shop that sold him the e-cigarette blamed faulty batteries. The incident come after a 62-year-old man in Merseyside died in August, in what was thought to be Britain's first death from an exploding e-cigarette. Mr Aspinall will need three years of skin grafts to recover, doctors treating him have warned . Mr Aspinall said: 'There was lots of blood, a huge hole in one leg and a gash in the other' Having switched to e-cigarettes for health reasons, he has now reverted to regular tobacco, branding it 'safer' Investigators believe the blaze started when an e-cigarette that was charging in the bedroom exploded and set fire to an oxygen concentrator - thought to have been used by the victim, David Thompson. It is believed he was using a third-party charger that did not come with the original e-cigarette. In May, a mother and her two young children fled for their lives when an e-cigarette exploded, setting their flat on fire. A fireman told Keeley Cooper, 22, the clouds of toxic smoke could have killed her and her sons Ellis, five, and Riegan, two, if they had been asleep. Miss Cooper had to stay in a bed and breakfast while her council flat in Shard End, Birmingham, was repaired.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A Spanish town is looking to the past to safeguard the future of its ailing economy by reintroducing  the peseta. Fed up with the failing euro, rebellious locals in Villamayor de Santiago have reverted to using the old currency, which was phased out a decade ago. Around 30 shops in the historic town,  75 miles south-east of Madrid, started accepting pesetas last month after urging customers to dig out any old notes and coins they had forgotten about. Bring back the peseta: The Spanish village of Villamayor de Santiago has re-introduced the peseta. Pictured is a poster from villages on the border with Portugal which are also campaigning for a permanent return . As they were: The peseta was phased out in 2002 when the euro was introduced . News quickly spread, and shoppers from neighbouring villages and towns have been flocking there to spend the old currency. Luis Miguel Campayo, chairman of the . local merchants’ association, who came up with the idea, said:  ‘People . kept hold of old pesetas thinking that they might come in handy one day . if the euro fails. ‘It seems that those fears might come . true. Lots of Spaniards,  especially older people, have a strong . emotional attachment to the peseta and still do their sums in it when . talking about big transactions. The economy is struggling so much that . euros are scarce. ‘We thought that if people had a hunt around for their old pesetas, then why shouldn’t we accept them as legal currency? ‘It was after Christmas and shops really needed a helping hand and this is what we came up with.’ Exchange: The euro and peseta exchange rate stood at 166.386 pesetas per euro when the single currency was aligned in January 1999 . The country introduced the peseta in 1868, joined the euro in December 2001 and phased out the old currency in February 2002. However, unlike other euro countries such as France and Italy, it never set a deadline for exchanging pesetas into euros. Troubled times: New Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is trying to turn around the country's economy . The town, which is in the same region . where La  Mancha cheese is made, planned to run the scheme for only a . month after it began on January 9. However, it was such a success that . the plan has been extended. Locals are paying with pesetas  in chemists, hardware stores and grocery shops among others. Some have brought notes of up to 5,000 . pesetas, worth 30 euros (£25), while many are using coins of just 50, . 100 or 500 pesetas. At the end of the project Mr  Campayo . will take the money to the Bank of Spain in Madrid and exchange it for . euros before  handing the notes out to the  shopkeepers. So far they . have taken more than a million pesetas (£5,000). The Bank of Spain estimates there are around £1.4billion worth of pesetas in Spain that have not been exchanged since 2002. According to a recent study by . Spain’s consumers’ association OCU, the price of essential goods has . risen by 43 per cent since the introduction of the euro. The cost of . bread is up by 49 per cent while milk has risen 48 per cent and the . price of potatoes has  increased by 116 per cent. Town mayor Jose Julian Fernandez said he backed the scheme, adding: ‘I support any measure that helps our economy.’ More than a third of the 3,000 people . who live in Villamayor de Santiago are unemployed as Spain battles its . worst economic crisis since the Civil War. The village of Villamayor de Santiago is 80 miles south east of Madrid . Nearly a quarter of all Spaniards are . out of work, with half of those under the age of 25 unable to find  a . job – a higher unemployment rate than even Greece or Portugal. The situation is said to be so poor . that those who have jobs are even refusing to go on holiday in case they . are made redundant while they are away.

"Paedophile: Christopher Jarvis hides his face as he arrives at Plymouth Crown Court today.The former child safeguarding officer for the Diocese of Plymouth was jailed for 12 months . A Catholic Church child safety co-ordinator who was in charge of investigating sexual abuse allegations was jailed for 12 months today for internet peadophile offences. Christopher Jarvis, 49, a married father-of-four, investigated historic claims of child abuse, interviewing the victims when they were adults. He was responsible for child protection at 120 churches and parish community groups for nine years. He also, as a member of the Devon and . Cornwall Multi-Agency Safeguarding Team, had access to police and . social services information about victims of child abuse. As . a result of the conviction and sentencing, the Roman Catholic Church . has ordered a review of child protection across the South West of . England. According to The Times, the Bishop of Plymouth, the Right Rev Christopher Budd, has asked the NSPCC to carry out the inquiry into child protection arrangements in Devon, Cornwall and Dorset. The revelations . that the church hired a peadophile in a key child protection role will . add to the controversy surrounding the Roman Catholic Church in England . and Wales over its handling of sexual abuse. At . the time of his arrest in March this year, Jarvis was leading an . investigation into an historic sex abuse allegation at Buckfast Abbey, a . Benedictine monastery in Devon. He was arrested after uploading images of pre-pubescent boys on to the Ning social networking website. Police officers who traced him to his home in Plymouth, Devon, found more than 4,000 child porn images, mainly of boys aged 10 to 12, on his church-supplied computer and a memory stick when they raided the house in Penrose Road. The court heard that 4,389 images were found on the laptop and memory stick. The majority, 3,721, were at Level One, the lowest level for abusive images. But there were 120 at Level Four, which . includes scenes of child rape, and 12 at Level Five, which can include . scenes of torture and sadism. Jarvis, who the court heard claimed he was abused as a child, was sentenced at the city's crown court after admitted 12 counts of making, possessing and distributing indecent images at a previous magistrates' court hearing. Inquiry: At the time of his arrest, Christopher Jarvis was leading an investigation into an historic sex abuse allegation at Buckfast Abbey in Devon. The Roman Catholic Church has now ordered a review of child protection across the South West of England . The court was told that Jarvis, who was . fired as soon as he admitted his crimes to the police, has been barred . from attending any Catholic services in Plymouth. He felt 'ostracised' by the church since his arrest, the court was told, and had attempted to commit suicide. Police who examined the computer after Jarvis's arrest found that, as well as the images, he had viewed erotic content about a relationship between a nine-year-old boy and an adult man. Diminutive and bespectacled, Jarvis hid his face with his hand from the people in the public gallery for the majority of the hearing. Passing sentence, Judge Paul Darlow dismissed attempts by the defence to have sentence deferred to examine whether Jarvis would benefit more from psychiatric help than prison. Investigation: The Bishop of Plymouth, the Right Rev Christopher Budd, pictured, ordered a review into child protection arrangements in the South West following the arrest and conviction of Christopher Jarvis . Judge Darlow told him that, despite appearing to his work colleagues as 'caring, helpful and honest', he had been 'elective and cynical' in downloading and distributing child porn. 'You, of all people, were more aware than others of the massive theft of innocence and long-term damage exacted on the children whose images you downloaded for your own sexual gratification,' he said. 'In the circumstances, your behaviour was more elective and cynical than might otherwise have been the case. 'It had a deep impact upon the church. In the eyes of the public you had a respectable position in the church. 'The people who confided in you of their own misery and abuse may well themselves be shocked and horrified that the person they were speaking to was, in his personal life, downloading images of children being abused in the same way.' The court heard that Jarvis had . refused to sign a 'covenant of care' the church requires all convicted . sex offenders to sign before they are allowed to rejoin congregations. Defence barrister Jo Martin said: 'He feels ostracised by the Catholic Church and that is why he had decided not to sign the covenant of care. 'He has decided now that he will not . go to church. The lack of forgiveness is very difficult for him to deal . with as a man of faith.' His public work persona was of a . caring professional good at his job, while in his personal life he . suffered from 'low self-esteem and his sense of inadequacy' stemming . from his own abuse as a child. It was this, she told the court, that had led him into downloading child pornography. In a statement, David Pond, the independent chairman of the Child Safeguarding Commission for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Plymouth, said the NSPCC carried out an independent review of child protection across the South West of England and cases Jarvis had been involved with and found no evidence that he had acted improperly in his role with the church. 'The church is and remains absolutely committed to ensuring that a safe environment exists for all in the church and the knowledge that Jarvis was himself guilty of such offences has been a great shock to the many people who had placed their trust in him and worked with him to protect vulnerable children and adults,' he said, . 'He was a fully qualified social worker and came to the role following a competitive recruitment process being of good character and with very good references. 'We need to be continually vigilant and aware of the need to have reliable checks and controls in place to manage the risk to vulnerable children and adults and we will continue to review and improve our responses to all forms of abuse.' Jarvis was jailed for 36 weeks concurrently for each of six charges of possessing indecent images of a child and five of making an indecent image of a child plus a further 16 weeks consecutively for a single charge of distributing indecent images of children.","Church orders review of child protection across the South West of England .

"Two brothers have broken a record for growing Britain's heaviest vegetable - with a pumpkin weighing in at 1,884 pounds. Twins Ian and Stuart Paton, 53, previously held the record until it was beaten by a pumpkin last year that weighed 1,520 pounds. However, the Patons, from Pennington, Hampshire, reclaimed the record yesterday at an annual weigh-in of Britain's biggest pumpkin. The Paton brothers' pumpkin (pictured), weighing in at nearly a ton, needed to be lifted by a tractor . And amazingly, they smashed the record with their enormous 4.5ft tall pumpkin, which has a circumference of 17ft and 4in. Grower Ian said: 'It's absolutely enormous.' Moments before they smashed the record, farmer Mark Baggs from Dorset thought he had set it himself with a massive 1,582 pound vegetable. Ian said: 'Mark is a great friend of ours - we have known him for over ten years - and it was actually him who took our British record last year. 'When his went on the scales we though it was huge and there couldn't be much in it. 'But it's brilliant to take another step closer to the world record. Mark is chuffed to bits for us.' The record for the world's biggest pumpkin is  2,032 pounds and the brothers are confident they can top it one day. The twins placed it on the back of their truck and transported it to the annual competition at the Royal Victoria Country Park in Netley, Hampshire. Twins Stuart (left) and Ian Paton with their record breaking pumpkin at the Royal Victoria Country Park, Netley . Over 1,000 people attended the event in aid of the Jubilee Sailing Trust as 25 competitors entered their prized pumpkin assets. Ian added: 'The secret behind it is that we feed them well, if you want to grow anything you've got to feed it right. 'If you feed your pumpkin properly then you're going to end up with a big one. 'We want to get the world record at one point and that's what we do it for. I think we will get there in the end.' The twins kept their record-breaker at a garden and plant nursery which they own in Pennington. They planted their pumpkin - the sole survivor of a group of seven - in April and have carefully nurtured it since. Ian said: 'We just lost two of them because of soft spots in them - the competition rules are really tough. 'We had to throw away about 4,500 pounds of pumpkin because of it.'","Hampshire brothers break record with pumpkin weighing almost a ton .

"Eight puppies were forced to eat each other to try to survive after their owners locked them in a kitchen where they starved to death. Despite the appalling case of animal cruelty Sam Hessin, 39, and her two children, Damon, 22, and Hazel, 18, were spared jail. Pictures released by the RSPCA show the dogs' rotting remains in the house in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, lying in their own faeces. The Hessin family barricaded the eight pets - which were around six months old - into the downstairs room because they were biting them and did not know what else to do. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . The family left the animals, which were around six-months-old, to starve to death in a downstairs room in their home . Damon Hessin (left) and his sister Hazel (right) have been banned from keeping animals for life after they let eight puppies starve to death . Prosecutor . Kevin McCole said: 'The smell was almost unbearable, with dog faeces . several inches thick. It was likely the place had not been cleaned for . months or even years. 'It was clear the puppies had suffered and would have been obvious they were unwell and needed help.' He added: 'The life of some might have been extended by eating the others.' Neighbours described being able to hear the dogs howling at night and hit out at the sentences they were handed. Sam Hessin was given an 18 week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, when she appeared at court last month . One said: 'That family should be in jail now, not allowed to swan about like nothing happened. 'It's . just awful how they put those poor dogs through such torture. People . often heard the animals crying in the evenings but no one believed it . was because they were dying. 'A . friend of mine saw the RSPCA officers come out of the house when they . raided it and there were grown men in tears at the state of the place. Their sentence was soft. They got away with it.' Damon and Hazel have both been banned from keeping animals for life after admitting causing suffering to the eight dogs. They were both given suspended sentences at Leicester Magistrates' Court. Sam Hessin, 40, banned her two children from going into the kitchen and they used the living room to cook their meals. She was given an 18-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work and told to pay an £80 victim surcharge at a court appearance last month. She was also banned from keeping animals for life. On . Friday Damon Hessin was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison suspended for . 12 months and ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work. The . same day Hazel Hessin was given an eight week sentence suspended for . six months and ordered to attend a 10-day training course. Both were ordered to pay £180 court costs and a £80 victim surcharge. The court heard RSPCA officers raided . their rented £120,000 home in Melton Mowbray, on May 1 after . a tip-off from the family’s landlady. The RPSCA have released shocking images of the dogs' remains which they discovered after they raided the home earlier this year . Investigators . were shocked to find the rotting remains of the dogs in the kitchen . which had been kept out-of-bounds by the family. When RSPCA inspector Deb Scotcher . entered the kitchen she found six Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppies . dead on the kitchen floor and further investigation led to the discovery . of two puppy skulls. Prosecutor . Kevin McCole told magistrates: 'When the inspector walked into the . kitchen the smell was rancid and putrid, to her horror she saw the . puppies were in advanced stages of decomposition, on a urine stained . bed. 'Dog faeces was several inches thick and everything in the kitchen was in a total state of disarray. 'The vet estimated the puppies would have been about six months old when they died. The sight and smell of them was shocking and deeply distressing.' Roger Wood, chairman of the magistrates’ bench, told the brother and sister: 'Had this been a trial you would both be going to prison.' Speaking . after the case, RSPCA inspector Deborah Scotcher said: 'The sentence . was very appropriate, it was a harrowing case, the worst one I’ve seen, . I’ll never forget it.

"Jude Law is set to become a father for the fifth time. The 41-year-old actor and his ex-girlfriend Catherine Harding are set to welcome their first child together into the world early next year. Despite their split, the exes are determined to put everything into raising the baby. A representative for the star told People: 'I can confirm that Jude Law and Catherine Harding are expecting a child together in the spring. Scroll down for video . Here we go again! Jude Law, pictured in London last month, is set to become a father for the fifth time . 'Whilst they are no longer in a relationship, they are both wholeheartedly committed to raising their child. 'They consider this a private matter and other than this confirmation no statement will be made. 'I ask that you respect the privacy of all parties involved and their families.' The Holiday star already has three children, sons Rafferty, 18; and Rudy, 12; and daughter Iris, 13; with his ex-wife Sadie Frost, who he divorced in 2003, who he shares custody with. Family man: Jude with ex-wife Sadie and his two sons Rafferty and Rudy, daughter Iris and former stepson Finlay, whose father is Gary Kemp, pictured last month . Working hard: The baby news broke as Jude is on location in West Sussex filming his new movie The Genius . He also has a five-year-old daughter, Sophia, with American model Samantha Burke following a brief fling in 2008. This latest development is somewhat of a surprise as Jude has been mostly single over the past few years. He was last linked to actress Ruth Wilson until earlier this year after they often photographed together, although she insisted they were 'just friends'. Former flame: Jude was previously engaged to Sienna Miller, but they split after his affair with his children's nanny . In 2008 - before his fling with Samantha - Jude was photographed kissing Rod Stewart's socialite daughter Kimberly, who has since gone to have a child with Benicio Del Toro. Aside from his wife Sadie, Jude's most high-profile romance was his on-off relationship with Sienna Miller. The couple met on the set of Alfie in 2003 shortly after his separation from Sadie, with the actor proposing on Christmas Day 2004. However, their romance was rocked when in July 2005 it was revealed he had had an affair with his former children's nanny Daisy Wright four months earlier while filming in the US. Love child: Jude had a daughter Sophia with American model Samantha Burke following a brief fling in December 2008 . Scandal: Jude had a month-long affair with nanny Daisy Wright in March 2005 while filming in America . The actor publicly apologised at the time, saying: 'I am deeply ashamed and upset that I've hurt Sienna and the people most close to us. 'I want to publicly apologise to Sienna and our respective families for the pain that I have caused. 'There is no defence for my actions which I sincerely regret and I ask that you respect our privacy at this very difficult time.' Although Sienna ditched her engagement ring, they tried to salvage their relationship, eventually splitting in November 2006. The pair then rekindled their romance in December 2009 after starring in different Broadway plays at the same time. However, just weeks after buying a home together in North London the pair split for good in February 2011. Sienna started dating her now-fiance Tom Sturridge just a month later and they now have a two-year-old daughter Marlowe together. Jude admitted five years ago that becoming a father shifted his priorities in life and gave him a wake-up call. He said in 2009: 'Being a daddy is what counts. I used to sleep until noon, but it's not so bad to have to get up at 7 and give them breakfast. 'My daughter made me realise that if there's anything that's going to make a man of you, it's having your will broken by a little girl.' Friendly exes: Jude and Sadie separated in February 2003 after six years of marriage . Meanwhile, Jude’s eldest son, Rafferty, this week spoke of the pressures of having a famous dad. The budding musician, who calls himself Raff as ‘I don’t really like the name Rafferty’, is in a band called The Dirty Harrys. Of not following in his father’s footsteps, he told the London Evening Standard: ‘I did feel a bit of pressure when I joined my first boarding school [Bedales in Hampshire]. ‘In my drama lesson, I think everyone thought: ""Oh God, he’s going to be so brilliant"". Then they realised that I wasn’t that good, so they just let me get on with it.’ He said meeting Blur and The Clash through his parents had helped him forge a music career, adding: ‘I did work experience for Blur for two weeks when they were rehearsing for their reunion gig, because Damon [Albarn] is really good friends with my dad. I tuned their guitars and stuff.’ 1994: Jude meets future wife Sadie Frost on the set of the film Shopping when he was 21 and she was 28 and separated from Spandau Ballet's Gary Kemp, father of her son Finlay . 1996: Sadie gives birth to Jude's first child Rafferty . 1997: Jude married Sadie . 2000: Sadie gives birth to their daughter Iris . 2002: Their son Rudy is born .

"Dozens of French teenagers, including a young Jewish girl, have fled the country to join Islamic State militants fighting in Syria and Iraq, French intelligence has revealed. At least 100 girls and young women from France have left to join terrorists in Syria in recent weeks, up from just a handful 18 months ago when the trip was not even on Europe's security radar. The departures are less the whims of adolescents and more the  conclusions of months of work by organised radical recruitment networks that specifically target young people in search of an identity. These mostly online networks recruit girls to serve as wives, babysitters and housekeepers for jihadists, with the aim of planting multi-generational roots for a long-lasting Islamic caliphate. Scroll down for video . Lost: Kamel Ali Mehenni and his wife Severine hold pictures of their daughter Sahra at their home in Lezignan Corbieres, France. The image on the left is a frame grab taken from a CCTV camera showing her at a train station on her way to join Islamic State militants fighting in Syria and Iraq .

Frontline: At least 100 girls and young women from France have left to join ISIS terrorists in Syria (pictured) in recent weeks, up from just a handful 18 months ago when the trip was not even on Europe's security radar . On the day she left for Syria, Sahra strode along the train platform with two bulky schoolbags slung over her shoulder. In a grainy image caught on security camera, the French teen tucks her hair into a headscarf. Just two months earlier and a two-hour drive away, Nora, also a teen girl, had embarked on a similar journey in similar clothes. Her brother later learned she'd been leaving the house every day in jeans and a pullover, then changing into a full-body veil. Neither had ever set foot on an airplane. Yet both journeys were planned with the precision of a seasoned traveler and expert in deception, from Sahra's ticket for the March 11 Marseille-Istanbul flight, to Nora's secret Facebook account and overnight crash pad in Paris. The teenagers travelling to join ISIS come from all walks of life, and although most are first and second generation immigrants from Muslim countries, many come from white French backgrounds. Despite ISIS repeatedly expressing of deep hatred of Jews, there was even a Jewish girl, according to a security official who spoke anonymously because rules forbid him to discuss open investigations. Innocence lost: A painting of Mecca is seen on a shelf in Sahra Ali Mehenni's bedroom in  France. Sahra is one of 100 girls and young women from France who have left to join terrorists in Syria in recent weeks . Heartbroken: Kamel Ali Mehenni (left) and his wife Severine pose for a picture in their living room in Lezignan Corbieres, France. The couple have spoken to their daughter Sahra three times since she left to join the Islamic State but believe her communication is being scripted by the terrorists . A local Kurdish official and Syrian activists say militants from the Islamic State are shelling a Syrian border crossing with Turkey to try and capture it and cut off the embattled town of Kobane. The official, Idriss Nassan, says ISIS aim to seize the crossing in order to close the noose around the town's Kurdish defenders and prevent anyone from entering or leaving Kobane. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the militants this morning shelled several areas in Kobane, including the border crossing, which is the town's only gateway to Turkey. The Islamic State pushed into Kobane for the first time since launching its offensive in the area in mid-September. Activists say the fighting over Kobane has killed more than 500 people. Young girls are also coming from elsewhere in Europe, including between 20 and 50 from Britain. However, the recruitment networks are particularly developed in France, which has long had a troubled relationship with its Muslim community, the largest in Europe. Distraught families plead that their girls are kidnap victims, but a proposed French law would treat them as terrorists who will be arrested if they return. Sahra's family has spoken to her three times since she left, but her mother, Severine, thinks her communication is being scripted by the terrorists. 'They are being held against their will,' says Severine, a French woman of European descent. 'They are over there. They're forced to say things.' The Ali Mehenni family lives in a red-tiled, middle-class home in Lezignan-Corbieres, a small town in the south of France. Sahra, who turns 18 on Saturday, swooned over her baby brother and shared a room with her younger sister. But family relations turned testy when she demanded to wear the full Islamic veil, dropped out of school for six months and closed herself in her room with a computer. Distraught: Fouad El-Bahty poses for a photographer in Avignon, France. His sister Nora is one of more than 100 girls from France who have left to join Islamic State terrorists in Syria in recent months . Documentation: A legal file detailing the investigation into the disappearance of French teenager Nora El Bahty, who left her home in Avignon to join the Islamic State in Syria in January . Now she was in a new school. And she seemed to be maturing - she asked her mother to help her get a passport, because she wanted her paperwork as an adult in order. On the morning of March 11, Sahra casually told her father she was taking extra clothing to school to teach her friends to wear the veil. Kamel stifled his anxiety and drove her to the train station. He planned to meet her there just before dinner, as he did every night. At lunchtime on March 11, she called her mother. I'm eating with friends, she said. Surveillance video showed at that moment, Sahra was at the airport in Marseille, preparing to board an Istanbul-bound flight. She made one more phone call that day, from the plane, to a Turkish number, her mother said. By nightfall, she had not returned. Her worried parents went to police. They noticed the missing passport the next day.

They did everything so that she could plan to the smallest detail,' Severine says. 'I never heard her talk about Syria, jihad. It was as though the sky fell on us.' Sahra told her brother in a brief call from Syria that she had married to a 25-year-old Tunisian she had just met, and her Algerian-born father had no say because he wasn't a real Muslim. Her family has spoken to her twice since then, always guardedly, and communicated a bit on Facebook. But her parents no longer know if she's the one posting the messages. Sahra told her brother she's doing the same things in Syria that she did at home - housework, taking care of children. She says she doesn't plan to return to France, and wants her mother to accept her religion, her choice, her new husband. Nora's family knows less about her quiet path out of France, but considerably more about the network that arranged her one-way trip to Syria. Nora grew up the third of six children in the El-Bahty family, the daughter of Moroccan immigrants in the tourist city of Avignon. Her parents are practicing Muslims, but the family does not consider itself strictly religous. Not only France: A number of young British Muslims, including Reyaad Khan (left) and Nasser Muthanna (centre) from Cardiff, and Abdul Raqib Amin from Aberdeen (right)  have also travelled to Syria to join ISIS . Barbaric: ISIS rebranded as the Islamic State after declaring the foundation of a caliphate earlier this year . She was recruited on Facebook. Her family does not know exactly how, but propaganda videos making the rounds play to the ideals and fantasies of teenage girls, showing veiled women firing machine guns and Syrian children killed in warfare. The French-language videos also refer repeatedly to France's decision to restrict use of veils and headscarves, a sore point among many Muslims. Nora was 15 when she departed for school on Jan. 23 and never came back. The next day, Foad, her older brother, learned that she had been veiling herself on her way to school, that she had a second phone number, that she had a second Facebook account targeted by recruiters. 'As soon as I saw this second Facebook account I said, `She's gone to Syria,'' Foad says. The family found out through the judicial investigation about the blur of travel that took her there. First she rode on a high-speed train to Paris. Then she flew to Istanbul and a Turkish border town on a ticket booked by a French travel agency, no questions asked. A young mother paid for everything, gave her a place to stay overnight in Paris and promised to travel with her the next day, according to police documents. She never did. Nora's destination was ultimately a 'foreigners' brigade' for the Nusra Front, an al-Qaida branch in Syria, Foad says. The idea apparently was to marry her off. But she objected and one of the emirs intervened on her behalf. For now at least, she remains single, babysitting children of jihadis. She has said she wants to come home - and Foad traveled to Syria but was not allowed to leave with her. 'As soon as they manage to snare a girl, they do everything they can to keep her,' Foad says. 'Girls aren't there for combat, just for marriage and children. A reproduction machine.' Two people have been charged in Nora's case, including the young mother. Other jihadi networks targeting girls have since been broken up, including one where investigators found a 13-year-old girl being prepared to go to Syria, according to a French security official. 'It is not at random that these girls are leaving. They are being guided. She was being commanded by remote control,' says family lawyer Guy Guenoun 'And now she has made a trip to the pit of hell.'","At least 100 girls and young women from France have recently left for Syria .

"It started more than 30 years ago when Michael Thomasson received Cosmic Avenger on the Colecovision from his grandparents for Christmas. Now, aged 43, Mr Thomasson, from Buffalo, New York, has amassed a world record collection of 10,607 video games - a total that grows at a rate of two every day. In order to play his mammoth collection, worth around $820,000, he also owns 108 consoles and computers dating back to the 1980s. Michael Thomasson, 43, has broken a Guinness World Record by collecting 10,607 video games . He claims to buy an average of two a day, costing him $3,000 a year, and says he now has more than 11,000 . In order to play the $800,000 worth of games he also has 108 consoles dating back to the 1980s . Mr Thomasson said: 'When I purchased a copy of the records book in 2011 and saw the current holder's entry, I knew that I was close if not already over the standing record. Thomasson smashed the previous record of 8,616 titles held by former 'king of video games' Richard Lecce . 'I was delighted when the Guinness Book of World Records gave me a certificate verifying that I have 'The Largest Collection of Videogames' with the count being 10,607 at the time. 'I have well over 11,000 unique games in my collection at this point, I average buying about two games every day. 'I've had to sell off parts of my collection twice - once in 1989 and once in 1998 - so that's essentially pressing the reset button. 'But thankfully I've since managed to reacquire most of the games over the years again. But one still remains elusive - the aptly named Magical Chase.' Mr Thomasson started his collection as a 12-year-old boy when he received Cosmic Avenger from his grandparents. 'I started collecting almost immediately as the Colecovision was my first love and I wanted to get every game available for the console,' he said. 'I sold my entire collection in late 1989 to raise money to buy a Sega Genesis. 'My wife's father died when she was three, so when we got married in 1998, we didn't have the traditional father-of-the-bride to help pay for the wedding, so we had to finance most of the festivities ourselves. Thomasson sold parts of the collection twice - once in 1989 to buy a Sega Genesis console, and again in 1998 in order to pay for his wedding . The first game he ever owned was Cosmic Avenger for the Colecovision, given to him as a Christmas present . 'As a result, I sold off complete collections to help fund our marriage - which was worth every penny.' He now spends more than £1,800 every year on bulking out his collection which smashed the previous record held by Richard Lecce, nicknamed king of video games in 2010, who amassed a total of 8,616 titles. Thomasson's first ever game was for the Colecovision which launched in 1982 and was discontinued in 1985 .","Michael Thomasson, 43, has collected games since age 12 .

"Suspicious: Shane Todd was found dead in his Singapore apartment last summer. He apparently hanged himself, but his family claims he was murdered . The hanging death of an American electronics engineer in Singapore last summer has ignited an international mystery, after his family and girlfriend developed suspicions that he may have been murdered the week before he was scheduled to return home to the U.S. The family of Shane Todd visited his apartment in the Chinatown district of Singapore days after they received news of his June 2012 death, saying that their son had misgivings about some of the work he was doing for the company. Dr Todd, 31, was slated to return to the U.S. after completing an 18-month stint at the Institute of Microelectronics, and his family is now desperately searching for how – and why – their son is dead. A February 15 piece published in the Financial Times magazine tells of how Mr Todd’s parents, Mary and Rick Todd, traveled from Montana to Singapore days after their son’s death on June 23, 2012. Mrs Todd told the magazine in no uncertain terms: ‘We think our son was murdered.’ The Todds did not immediately respond to a request sent by MailOnline. According to the magazine, the Todds, joined by their sons, John and Dylan, went to see where Shane had spent his last hours. His parents have said he was murdered because of his involvement in the project, which they say involved exporting sensitive military technology to China. IME did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment. The family told the FT that they discovered several things awry at Dr Todd’s Colonial-era apartment. Piles of laundry were neatly folded and ready to be packed in suitcases, packed moving boxes littered the apartment, and his plane ticket back to the States was sitting on his dining room table. Close: Mary and Rick Todd, center, are mourning the death of their son Shane (back right, pictured with brothers John, back left, Dylan, front right, Chet and his wife Corynne , front left) The Singapore police report from last summer states that Mr Todd – who stood more than 6ft and 200 pounds – constructed a sort of noose by bolting a pulley to the bathroom wall and wrapping a strap through the contraption. However, when the Todd family arrived days later, they were appalled to find that their late son’s front door was unlocked, there was no crime tap indicating an active investigation, and more importantly – no bolts drilled into the bathroom. The Singapore Police released a statement today in response to the FT article, reading in part: ‘The police investigate all unnatural death cases thoroughly, working closely with the pathologist and other relevant experts, and no prior assumptions are made on the cause of death,’ according to Yahoo! Singapore. The FT article also states that the FBI bureau in Singapore has volunteered their forensic help on two separate occasions, but said that the local police had declined their help. An FBI source in Washington told the paper that they could do nothing to help the investigation until the Singapore Police formally accepted their assistance. In the statement, Singapore police added: ‘Since the death of Mr Shane Todd, the Police have engaged and assisted the family without impending the objectivity of our investigation process. We will continue to do so. Police have also kept the American Embassy and FBI informed of this case.’ The family also recovered a hard drive with backup data from his time at IME. The FT gave information on the hard drive to Professor Sir Colin Humphreys to analyze. The professor works as the director of research at Cambridge University’s Centre for Gallium Nitride. Brothers: Shane Todd was one of four boys and his grieving family want to know the truth about his death . According to the centre’s website, the chemical, known as GaN, is ‘probably the most important semiconductor material since silicon.’ The chemical is used in many of today’s high-tech products, from Blu-ray players to hybrid electric cars, and can withstand heat to much higher capacity than silicone. It is the building blocks for blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Sir Colin told the FT that the data on Dr Todd’s hard drive was fore a high-electron mobility transistor made from GaN, adding that the project had applications for both the military and commercial use. Singapore police said they were still investigating the death of Dr Todd and would submit their evidence to a coroner. Singaporean pathologists concluded in an autopsy last June that he died by hanging in his Singapore flat. Chemicals: Dr Todd was working with Gallium Nitrate (GaN), a synthetic material used in many high-tech objects like Blu-ray players and hybrid electric cars . 'IME approached Huawei on one occasion to cooperate with them in the GaN field, but we decided not to accept, and consequently do not have any cooperation with IME related to GaN,' Huawei said in a statement. Huawei said that the development of GaN technology was commonplace across the telecommunications industry. Interviews with the family, colleagues and friends revealed conflicting views on Dr Todd's state of mind before his death, the nature of his work and how he died. Colleagues said that he was increasingly depressed in his last few months, but said that his concerns appeared to centre on a sense of failure about his work, and an ambivalence about returning to the United States. On assignment: Dr Todd lived in the Chinatown district of Singapore; here the skyline is pictured . Researchers in unrelated fields have also questioned how, if his work was so sensitive, he was able to take home computer files from his office. IME is part of a network of research institutes managed by government-run Agency for Science, Technology and Research, or A*Star. A former A*Star researcher now working in the United States pointed out that IME and other A*Star institutes were not military research organizations. Huawei is one of the world's largest telecommunication equipment companies, but has been blocked from some projects in Australia and deemed a security risk by the U.S. congress on the grounds that its equipment could be used for spying, according to Reuters. Huawei has routinely denied such accusations and has said it is not linked to the Chinese government. Dr Todd's parents said in interviews in July that Singapore police and IME had failed to properly investigate his death after his body was found hanging from a door in his Singapore apartment on the evening of June 24, two days after he quit IME. Singapore police say they have handled the case as they have handled other cases, and their procedures follow high international standards. They said in such cases of unnatural death, 'no prior assumptions' were made about the cause. Big business: Huawei is one of the world's largest telecommunication equipment companies, but has been deemed a security risk by the U.S. congress on the grounds that its equipment could be used for spying . Mrs Todd said in a telephone interview with Reuters last July that he had been scared. 'I had been talking to him for months for at least an hour every week and he told us he was afraid of being murdered because of his contacts with the Chinese government,' she said. 'He quit his job because of it.' Huawei declined to say whether they had been working on other projects with IME. Colleagues said shortly after Todd's death that he had told them at one point he had been working on a project with Huawei but that it was not sensitive or high-level in nature. One described it as carrying out 'measurement test reports' of semiconductors. The FT said that Dr Todd had been involved in proposing a joint project with Huawei. While it did not say whether the project was approved, it quoted his parents as saying that subsequently he complained to them of being asked to do things with a Chinese company he did not identify that made him uncomfortable. Dr Todd was described in his obituary as an avid baseball player and a brilliant scientific mind. He earned his PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Santa Barbara.

"A father lets out a sob of ecstatic relief as he clutches his son. A mother, her face a picture of joy, holds her precious child as she flees the scene of a bloody hostage drama in Paris that cost the lives of four innocent people. In 15 astonishing minutes, police brought a dramatic end to two sieges after three days of terror had paralysed the French capital. Police commandos stormed a Jewish grocery store in a hail of bullets and stun grenades, killing an Al Qaeda-linked gunman who was holding 15 hostages. Twelve minutes earlier, and only 25 miles away, another stand-off ended with the deaths of Charlie Hebdo killers, Said and Cherif Kouachi. Firing their Kalashnikovs, they charged straight into the guns of hundreds of soldiers and police surrounding their final hideout. Scroll down for video. Relief: Two hostages leave with their young child (left) and a man carrying a small child is seen fleeing from the ordeal (right) after police stormed the kosher grocery store in eastern Paris . Going in: Special forces storm the Jewish grocery to the east of Paris where terrorist Amedey Coulibaly had taken hostages . Chilling: The body of a man can be seen at the entrance of the Jewish supermarket after it was stormed by commandos . Terrified: Hostages - who had been held for hours with Coulibaly threatening to kill them - flee from the shop, crying with relief . Running to safety: Police escort seven hostages freed from the kosher grocers, including one woman who had to be carried . The grocery store terrorist, Amedy Coulibaly, 32, gave an interview to a French TV station at the height of the siege in which he swore allegiance to Islamic State and claimed the three days of mayhem had been ‘synchronised’. Coulibaly confirmed he had shot a policewoman in the south of Paris on Thursday. ‘Them Charlie Hebdo; me the police,’ he said. One of his hostages had left a telephone line open so police could hear what was happening in the shop and moved in when the gunman began to pray. The Kouachi brothers, who were trained by Al Qaeda in Yemen, had a hostage they did not know about during their nine-hour siege at a printworks in Dammartin-en-Goele, near Charles de Gaulle airport, northeast of Paris. A 27-year-old graphic designer hid inside a box with his phone for more than six hours and updated police on his phone. Another man, Michel Catalano, who the brothers held during the stand-off, was able to walk to safety helped by police. The terrorists had told negotiators they wanted to ‘die as martyrs’ before mounting their fatal charge. Last night French president Francois Hollande spoke to the nation promising ‘all necessary measures will be used’ to protect the French people and called on them to remain united in ‘these difficult times’. He said the attacks had been carried out by fanatics who had nothing to do with Islam and said the assault on the grocery shop was ‘anti-semitic’. The country must remain vigilant against the possibility of further attacks, he stressed. The dual assaults brought to an end France’s biggest security operation with nearly 90,000 police and soldiers deployed initially to hunt down the brothers, and then Coulibaly, after he had shot dead the 27-year-old policewoman. Millions had watched gripped on television as the manhunt for the terrorists had ended in bloody shootouts, car chases and sieges. At one point seven helicopters and more than 50 police and military vehicles had been involved in a high-speed chase during which shots were fired after the Kouachis broke cover from a forest where they had been sheltering 50 miles north east of Paris. Dead: Amedey Coulibaly was shot dead after taking at least six hostages at a grocery store in east Paris. He is believed to be have been working with his girlfriend Hayat Boumeddiene (right) who was said to be 'armed and dangerous' Dead: Cherif Kouachi (left), 32, and his brother Said  (right) were killed in a firefight with French special forces at a industrial site . Bloody climax: A huge ball of fire erupts amid gunfire and explosions as French special forces shoot dead the two Charlie Hebdo gunmen . In their sights: Police train their weapons on the building where the Charlie Hebdo gunmen were holed up with a hostage in Dammartin-en-Goele . Algerian secret services warned France of an imminent attack 24 hours before the Paris atrocity, it was claimed last night. Officials told their French counterparts that a ‘major terrorist operation was in preparation on French territory’ on January 6, according to TV station iTele. The claim is particularly interesting because the Kouachi brothers behind the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo offices were French nationals of Algerian descent. They were radicalised by the Buttes-Chaumont jihadist recruitment cell, primarily made up of Franco-Algerians. They were forced in to the industrial estate at Dammartin-en-Goele where they made their last stand. Local residents were evacuated or ordered to lock themselves in their homes as what was described as ‘a small army’ of soldiers and police surrounded them, throwing a cordon around the area. ‘They said they want to die as martyrs,’ Yves Albarello, a local politician who was inside the command post, claimed. Meanwhile, across Paris, Coulibaly, brandishing his Kalashnikov, wearing a bullet proof vest and firing at shoppers, had stormed the kosher supermarket near the Porte de Vincennes, shooting or taking hostage those inside. Police said he was accompanied by a woman called Hayat Boumeddiene, 26. They were described as ‘armed and dangerous.’ Her fate was unknown last night amid reports that she was on the run. Unknown to the gunman, several Jewish families were hiding in a freezing store room below, listening to the gunfire and terror above. It appeared that at one point Coulibaly and the Kouachis were in contact and police shut down all communications around the industrial site. Coulibaly warned a hostage negotiator that if the brothers were killed, he would open fire on his hostages. One woman trapped inside telephoned her mother to say: ‘I am in the shop. I love you.’ Explosion: The street is rocked during the final stages of the siege which left four hostages dead . Front door: Officers were also seen pouring in through the front door at the denouement of the siege . Assault force: Special forces line up to enter the premises through a backdoor as the street is rocked by explosions . Police locked down the area, swamping it with hundreds of security forces. Snipers could be seen on rooftops and at windows looking for a clear shot at Coulibaly. Last night there was a huge sense of relief in the French capital, mixed with disbelief and fears of more copycat strikes. There were difficult questions too for the intelligence services as to why they had stopped their surveillance on the Kouachi brothers when their jihadi terror links going back eight years were so well known. In a telephone call yesterday, Cherif Kouachi admitted he had been funded by a network loyal to Anwar al-Awlaki, the former American-born leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who was killed by a drone strike in 2011 in Yemen. Frantic: Police rush to the scene of the hostage-taking at an industrial estate in Dammartin-en-Goele around 25 miles from Paris . Siege: The gunmen are surrounded by police commandos who have begun negotiations to try to secure the release of the hostage . Trapped: The brothers were cornered in the premises of a printing firm after leading police on a dramatic car chase . Scoping it out: Police and armed forces take up positions in Dammartin-en-Goele after landing by helicopter in fields near the hostage scene . Hacker group Anonymous ‘declared war’ on Islamist terrorists last night saying they would smash their online networks. The group said it would track down and close social media accounts of militants, in a video and statement published online. A figure wearing the group’s symbolic Guy Fawkes mask appeared seated in front of a desk with the hashtag #OpCharlieHebdo. Speaking in French and with his voice obscured electronically, he said: ‘We are declaring war against you, the terrorists.’ How three days of terror unfolded after gunmen first stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris on Wednesday . Holed up: The gunmen escaped on foot into a small printing business (above) called Creating Trend Discovery, just before 9am GMT . In a separate statement posted online the group said ‘freedom of expression has suffered inhuman assault … and it is our duty to react’. The move is a novel departure for Anonymous which has previously carried out attacks on government, religious and corporate websites. Many of them were so-called ‘denial-of-service’ attacks. Two of the terrorists gave interviews by phone as the final moments of the sieges played out around Paris yesterday. From his printworks hideout, Cherif Kouachi told a radio journalist: ‘I am a defender of the Prophet. I was sent by Al Qaeda of Yemen. ‘I’m financed by Imam Anwar al-Awlaki. Anwar is a predicateur [preacher]. He has lived in the Yemen. He is one of the thinking heads of Al Qaeda.’ Al-Awlaki, who was killed in 2011 in Yemen by a US drone strike, was one of Al Qaeda’s top recruiters, US officials say. The French reporter who spoke to Kouachi said his manner was calm and determined, and he denied killing civilians. Chillingly, the terrorist insisted he did not see the murdered journalists at Charlie Hebdo as civilians, but merely as ‘targets’. Astonishingly, another journalist was also able to speak on the phone to Amedy Coulibaly, who had taken shoppers hostage at a kosher grocery in Porte de Vincennes. In the midst of the siege, the reporter asked Coulibaly: ‘Are you in contact with the two brothers?’ The gunman replied: ‘Yes, we made contact before the operations.’ He confirmed he had shot a policewoman in Paris the previous day, swore allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, and said the attacks were ‘synchronised’. ‘Them Charlie Hebdo; me the police,’ Coulibaly explained. Terrified hostages also reportedly called friends and family from the kosher deli. A woman told the French Europe 1 TV station she had received a call from her daughter, telling her: ‘I am in the shop, I love you.’","Hostages pictured fleeing Jewish grocery shop in east of the city where four people lost their lives .

"Murdered: A congressman has called for an FBI probe into the death of mayoral candidate Marco McMillian (pictured) in Mississippi . An openly gay Mississippi mayoral candidate whose body was found dumped on a riverbank last week was beaten and burned, his family has said. Marco McMillian's godfather, Carter Womack, said on Monday that the information came from the Coahoma County coroner, but the coroner declined to comment. Womack said the family was told McMillian's body was dragged under a fence and left near a Mississippi River levee last week. It was discovered on Tuesday. A person with knowledge of the . investigation told the Associated Press that McMillian had bruises and . there were burns on at least part of his body. On Thursday, Lawrence Reed, 22, was taken into custody and charged with the murder of McMillian, the state's first openly gay candidate for public office. He was running for mayor of Clarksdale.

"Government officials have hit out at CNN for reporting on the personal journal of murdered ambassador Chris Stevens, saying they did so against the wishes of his family. Anderson Cooper revealed on Friday night that the news channel had used the document as a source after finding it inside the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. But a State Department spokesman on Friday claimed that CNN had promised not to mention the journal, and described their U-turn as 'disgusting' and 'indefensible'. Scroll down to watch video from Wednesday's show . New revelations: On Wednesday, Anderson Cooper, left, told Senator John McCain, right, that a 'source familiar with Ambassador Stevens' thinking' said the envoy was worried about security . Mystery source: Cooper admitted two days later the CNN found Stevens' personal journal in Libya and used information from it in its reporting . Mr Stevens died alongside three other . Americans on September 11 when militant jihadists stormed the consulate . in protest against an American-made anti-Muslim video. CNN found the ambassador's personal . journal four days later, and used it to report on his state of mind . during Mr Cooper's primetime show on Wednesday. Slain: Ambassador Christoper Stevens was killed along with three other Americans during violent protests in Benghazi, Libya . However, the network broke a pledge . to Mr Stevens' family that it would not report on the diary, said State . Department spokesman Philippe Reines. The family was informed within hours . about the discovery of the journal, a hard-bound book that included . seven handwritten pages. CNN gave the document to an Italian . official at the State Department's request, and it is now being returned . to the ambassador's relative. 'Given the truth of how this was handled, CNN patting themselves on the back is disgusting,' Mr Reines said in his statement. 'Whose first instinct is to remove . from a crime scene the diary of a man killed along with three other . Americans serving our country, read it, transcribe it, email it around . your newsroom for others to read and then call the family?' In a phone call with the Stevens . family, CNN 'agreed to abide by the clear wishes of the Stevens family, . and pledged not to use the diary or even allude to its existence until . hearing back from the family,' he added. But four days later, 'They just went ahead and used it.' CNN defended its use of the journal's contents and asked, 'Why is the State Department now attacking the messenger?' The network continued: 'CNN did not . initially report on the existence of a journal out of respect for the . family, but we felt there were issues raised in the journal which . required full reporting, which we did.' Lucky find: Stevens' handwritten journal was discovered by CNN on the first floor of the burnt out U.S. consulate in Benghazi . Ravaged embassy: CNN described the U.S. consulate compound as being largely abandoned by the time its staff arrived there following the attack . On Wednesday's edition of Anderson . Cooper 360, the host told Senator John McCain that 'a source familiar . with Ambassador Stevens' thinking told us that in the months before his . death he talked about being worried about the never-ending security . threats that he was facing in Benghazi, and specifically about the rise . in Islamist extremism and growing al Qaeda presence.' Cooper added that 'the source also mentioned [Stevens] being on an al Qaeda hit list.' Two days later, Mr Cooper . acknowledged that the network had obtained Mr Stevens' journal, and that . some of the information regarding the late ambassador’s thought process . in the months leading to the deadly September 11, 2012, attack on the . U.S. consulate in Benghazi was drawn from his entries. 'On Wednesday of this week, we . reported that a source familiar with Ambassador Stevens' thinking said . in the months before his death, Ambassador Stevens talked about being . worried about what he called the never-ending security threats in . Benghazi,' Mr Cooper told his viewers on Friday night. 'We . also reported that the ambassador specifically mentioned the rise in . Islamic extremism, the growing al Qaeda presence in Libya and said he . was on an al Qaeda hit list. 'The . information for that report, like all of CNN's reporting, was carefully . vetted. Some of that information was found in a personal journal of . Ambassador Stevens in his handwriting. 'We . came upon the journal through our reporting and notified the family. At . their request, we returned that journal to them. We reported what we . found newsworthy in the ambassador's writings. A reporter followed up on . what we found newsworthy, as I said, in the ambassador's writings,' Mr . Cooper concluded. Bloody protests: Violent demonstrations broke out in Libya and across the Middle East on September 11 following the release of a U.S.-made film mocking the Prophet Mohammed . Last memento: CNN said it notified Stevens' family of the find and at their request handed over the journal to his relatives via a third party . Shortly after 1am on Saturday, CNN published . a story without a by-line on its website explaining how the journal . came into its possession, and how the information it contains was used . in the network's reporting. The journal consisting of seven handwritten pages in a hard-bound book was found on the floor of the ravaged consulate compound where Mr Stevens was fatally wounded. The network stated that it used Mr Stevens’ entries as tips shedding light on the situation in Libya and in Benghazi in particular. ‘CNN took the newsworthy tips and corroborated them with other sources,’ the article said. If CNN’s version of events is to be believed, the ‘source familiar with the ambassador's thinking’ mentioned by Mr Cooper during Wednesday’s show was not Mr Stevens’ journal since the network claims it only used tips from his entries. However, it remains unclear why CNN did not reveal that it had found the ambassador’s journal until Friday.

"Mystery surrounds the death of a celebrated computer hacker who claimed to know how to remotely kill someone fitted with a heart pacemaker – as happened in the fictional TV spy drama Homeland. Barnaby Jack died in San Francisco on Thursday, just days before he was due to give a speech revealing how implanted heart devices were at risk from fatal hacking attacks. The San Francisco Medical Examiner’s office confirmed the death last night but did not give any  further details. Scroll down for video . Mystery: The cause of Barnaby Jack's death is currently unknown. He gained notoriety after demonstrating how to hack into ATMs (pictured right) New Zealand-born Jack, 35, was scheduled to be one of the star guests at the Black Hat hacking convention in Las Vegas next week. In a presentation called Hacking Humans, he was planning to highlight the shortcomings of commonly used pacemaker machines by demonstrating how he could hack into them and kill the heart patient from 50ft away with a deadly power surge triggered by a wireless transmitter. An episode of the acclaimed US series Homeland, starring Damian Lewis and Claire Danes, showed a terrorist using a computer to hack into the Vice-President’s pacemaker and speed up his heartbeat until it kills him. In Homeland, the killer needed the serial number of the pacemaker, but Jack argued that in real life it was even simpler and knowing the code was not necessary. In a recent blog, he said: ‘The only implausible aspect of the hack was the range in which the attack was carried out. 'The attacker would have had to be in the same building or have a transmitter set up closer to the target. With that said, the scenario was not too far-fetched.’ He said some pacemakers could be commanded to deliver a deadly 830-volt shock from someone on a laptop up to 50ft away, the result of poor software programming by medical device companies. Barnaby Jack had claimed he had developed a technique for hacking pacemakers (file photograph) Jack claimed it was possible to infect the pacemaker companies’ servers with a bug that would spread through their system like a virus. ‘We are potentially looking at a worm with the ability to commit mass murder,’ he added. ‘It’s kind of scary.’ The possibility of such attacks is being taken so seriously by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that it has asked manufacturers to ensure greater protection for newer pacemakers which use wireless technology. Jack became one of the world’s most famous hackers after a 2010 demonstration of ‘Jackpotting’ – getting cash machines to spew out money. At the time of his death, Jack was director of embedded-device security for Seattle information-security firm IOActive. The company said in a tweet: ‘Lost but never forgotten, our beloved pirate, Barnaby Jack, has passed.’","Barnaby Jack had said he could kill a person from 30 feet by using the hack .

"Albert Peterson shot dead his wife and two sons hours after going to church because he dreaded the thought of Obama winning the election, a family friend has revealed. A confidante of the family for the past 25 years has spoken to MailOnline about the strength and grace of the Peterson family, as well as the torment that plagued Albert which drove him to shoot dead his wife Kathleen and his two sons Christopher and Mathew at their suburban home in DC on Sunday. A history of mental illness, the loss of a dear uncle, and a growing fear of Obama winning a second term in the White House took its toll on the mind of Mr Peterson, a wealthy defense contractor, the friend said. 'He just did not want his kids inheriting this mess,' Maggie L, who did not wish to reveal her last name, told MailOnline. 'Sometimes we thought he might take his own life when he was so depressed. We never thought he would take Kathie's.' Gone: Albert Peterson, left, shot dead his wife Kathleen, right, and two sons hours after going to church. The couple is pictured on January 4, 2010. Just Beginning: Christopher, 13, right was an eighth grader at Rachel Carson Middle School and Matthew, 16, left, was a sophomore at Westfield High School. Both were avid soccer players and active at their church . Albert, 57, Kathleen, 52, Matthew, 16, and Christopher, 13, were found Tuesday just after noon inside their home in Herndon, Virgina. Co-workers reported to police that they were concerned that Mr and Mrs Peterson had not reported to work for the past two days. Mr Peterson was a defense contractor and Mrs Peterson worked at Blackbird Technologies, a company that specializes in defense, law enforcement and intelligence work. Chris was an eighth grader at Rachel Carson Middle School and Matthew was a sophomore at Westfield High School. Both were avid soccer players and active at their church. The preliminary police investigation indicates that Albert Peterson killed his wife and their children before taking his own life. Each of the deceased died of gunshot wounds to the upper body. Maggie had been a friend of the family for the past three decades. 'I've known Kathie since I was 21. She's been like a sister to me,' Maggie said. 'If she knew her husband would have done this to her, she would have protected those boys till the end.' Albert and Kathleen Ortiz were married some 25 years ago, Maggie said, and met over a mutual love of fitness.Mrs Peterson, who was Puerto Rican, had an indomitable spirit, always active and pursuing adventure, Maggie said. 'That girl had such a zest for life,' Maggie sad. 'She was a consummate planner. She never wanted to waste an ounce of life.' She continued: 'If I was having a crappy day, she would come. If I needed advice, I said, ""Kathie, what do I do? What do I say?"" and she always set me straight. She always had advice. She was always there.' Mother: Mrs Peterson worked at Blackbird Technologies, a company that specializes in defense, law enforcement and intelligence work . But as time went on, Mr Peterson's paranoia and the demons from his past prevented him from enjoying life, his friends and his family. 'He's had difficulty his whole life,' Maggie said. 'He had a rough time with paranoia.' At a young age, Maggie said, both his father and his uncle committed suicide. 'His dad suffered from alopecia and it was something he couldn't live with,' Maggie said. After Mr Peterson's Uncle John killed himself, Maggie said that both Petersons were unnerved as they had frequently sent their children to his home to spend time with him. 'When Uncle John died, [Mr Peterson] kicked himself and said ""God, what would have happened if our sons were there when it happened?""' Maggie recalled. Thinking back on the eerie precursor, Maggie is still dumbfounded. 'It just never crossed our minds,' she said. Young: Mathew, left, and Christopher, right, pose for a photograph at an earlier date . Mr Peterson's life was punctuated by . bouts of paranoia that became so severe, he wallowed in his depression, . gained weight, and contemplated taking his own life. In one dark episode, after his mother died five years ago, his wife had to pull him from the brink of suicide. 'Kathie was a strong person and she probably put her foot down, like she did five years ago,' Maggie said. 'Kathie couldn't believe the way he was acting and how he thought.' 'She wanted to be out doing something - biking, hiking, tubing and I know that frustrated Al. She just wanted to be living life and he took that from her,' she said. Maggie said that this spring, Mr Peterson lost his Uncle Bill to an infection, whom he looked up to as the family patriarch. 'He felt like there was no one left in his family,' Maggie said. Mrs Peterson's family never fully warmed to Mr Peterson, Maggie said. 'I know that Kathie's brother hates him right now. Kathie's brother didn't speak to Al,' Maggie said. 'He saw something in Al that probably didn't sit well with him.' Recently, Mr Peterson began writing paranoid emails to his friends and family about politics on a daily basis, sometimes even more frequently, Maggie said. Tragic: The preliminary police investigation indicates that Albert Peterson killed his wife and their children before taking his own life . Shock: Each of the deceased died of gunshot wounds to the upper body . 'I got emails and the emails stopped all of a sudden last week,' Maggie said. 'He felt that our God-given rights were being taken away. He didn't like where the country was going.' Mr Peterson, also mentioned pressures at work that troubled Maggie. Explaining his increasingly erratic behavior, she said: 'He said he wanted to expose something at work. He also got the impression at work, that if they didn't vote for Obama and get him elected, they would lose their jobs,' 'We don't know. Maybe she put her foot down Sunday night and told him ""Al get it together,""' Maggie said, noting that both Kathleen and Albert had security clearances. 'When Al was here last time, he was pretty worked up,' Maggie said. 'They were very well off people and they saved a lot of money. He couldn't understand how the government could be so irresponsible and he thought it would be on the backs of his boys.' Police have confirmed Mr Peterson's feelings toward politics were unusually passionate, but declined to speculate what precipitated the tragedy. 'We don’t know the motive in this tragic case,' Lucy Caldwell of the Fairfax Police Department said. 'We are aware that the father had strong political opinions but cannot speculate as to how those opinions related to this case. We will, most likely, never know exactly why this occurred.' Community: A candlelight vigil for the family was held at Floris United Methodist Church, pictured, on Wednesday evening . Loss: Students at Rachel Carson . Middle School, left, and Westfield High . School, right, wore black to school on Wednesday to commemorate their classmates. On Thursday, they wore white as a sign of peace . As close as she was to the family, Maggie still cannot come to grips with what happened. 'To think that their father could do this to them...' Maggie said, weeping. 'The boys were so beautiful.' Matthew was born premature, Maggie said, and she remembers how small he was- tiny enough to fit in the palm of her hand. 'This boy was something special. Matthew didn’t have a mean bone in body. He protected kids that were bullied in school,' she said. Last weekend, Maggie, Kathleen, Matthew and Christopher attended a Mitt Romney rally together. That's when Matthew told Maggie his plans for college. 'I asked him where he wanted to go to college. He said Liberty University. He was so excited about going,' she said, weeping. Mr Peterson never made it to the rally. He got stuck trying to park the car and since his knees were bad, he couldn't walk to the event. 'Those boys were raised by one of the best Moms. Kathie knew every minute where her boys were. Those boys were never in trouble.' Students at Rachel Carson Middle School and Westfield High School wore black to school on Wednesday to mourn their classmates. On Thursday, they wore white as a sign of peace.","Albert, Kathleen, Mathew and Christopher Peterson were found dead Tuesday in their Herndon, Virginia home .

"Tragedy: Mississippi state Rep Jessica Upshaw was found dead of a single bullet wound to the head on Sunday . Authorities in Mississippi are investigating after a state lawmaker was found dead in a suspected suicide at the home of a former colleague, according to local officials. Republican Rep. Jessica Upshaw, 53, of the 95th District in Diamondhead, was found dead of an apparent gunshot wound to the head in the home of former Rep. Clinton Rotenberry. The cause of Upshaw's death is believed to be suicide, but authorities are still awaiting the results of an autopsy. Simpson County Sheriff Kenneth Lewis told  WLOX that Upshaw appeared to have shot herself in the head at the home in Mendenhall, which is located about 30 miles southeast of Jackson, the state capital, and about 110 miles from Upshaw's hometown. Upshaw, a Republican, was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 2004. She was not married, but has an adult daughter who lives in South Korea and is married with a newborn. Rotenberry, 60, also a Republican,  served in the 77th district as a state representative from 1992 to 2007, when he lost his seat to a challenger. He has a wife and three daughters. Rotenberry and Upshaw's daughter, Lauren Upshaw Welch, are Facebook friends. Welch is also connected to Rotenberry's daughter, Rebecca, on the social networking site. Mississippi state Rep. John Read told the Clarion-Ledger that he was a longtime friend of Upshaw's. He said Upshaw’s daughter and . son-in-law, both engineers working in South Korea, had recently brought . Upshaw’s infant grandson to Mississippi for a visit. Mystery: Upshaw's body was reportedly found with . a single bullet wound to the head at the home of former state Rep Clint . Rotenberry, pictured right . Mystery: Rotenberry, 60, is pictured with an unidentified woman. He served in the state legislature from 1992 to 2007 . 'She was very close with her daughter . and with her mother — just loved her family,' Read told the newspaper. 'Her heart was just so big. She’d do anything for you. She was just a . sweet person. I’m just shaken by this. We have lost a good person.' No one has been arrested in the case and the investigation has been handed over to the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation. Family: Upshaw's daughter, Lauren Upshaw Welch, is married with a new baby and lives with her husband in South Korea . The agency's spokesman, Michael Strain, did not return a call from MailOnline for comment. Upshaw was an attorney who was first elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 2004. Gov Phil Bryant told the paper: '[My wife] Deborah and I were saddened . to hear of the passing of Rep Jessica Upshaw. I have known Jessica for . many years as an unselfish and dedicated public servant. He added: 'This is a tragic loss for . her family and all Mississippians, and our thoughts and prayers go out . to her family during this difficult time.' Upshaw is the fifth Mississippi lawmaker in to die in the last few months. Joe Gardner of Batesville, died last month of a heart attack at the age of 68. Democratic Rep. David Gibbs, of West Point, died January 13. Two Democratic state senators, Bennie Turner, of West Point, and Alice Harden, of Jackson, died in late 2012. Rotenberry did not answer his phone, and his answering machine was full.

"Killed: Dr. Perry Inhofe died when the plane he was piloting came down outside Tulsa in a heavily wooded area . Controversial Republican Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe has confirmed that his son died in a plane crash on Sunday. Dr. Perry Inhofe worked as an orthopedic surgeon in Tulsa and was piloting the Mitsubishi MU-2B-25 twin turboprop aircraft that came down five miles from Tulsa International Airport. Oklahoma Highway Patrol spokesman George Brown said authorities confirmed that one person died in the crash which occurred at 3.40 p.m.in a heavily wooded area. According to flight tracking websites the aircraft took off from Salina, Kansas and was due to land at the airport after a 45 minute flight. Pilots cleared to land after the fatal crash reported to Tulsa World that the aircraft Dr. Inhofe was flying experienced engine failure. Witnesses Jake Bray and his uncle, Bryon Fry, were in the woods when the plane crashed about 400 yards away. 'I saw it go over once and don't think anything of it,' Bray said to Tulsa World. 'Then it circled around and I saw one propeller out. Then it nosed down and went down hard. 'It started spiraling out of control and it hit the ground. 'We were talking about trying and maybe pulling the guy out if that was possible. A small plane burns after crashing near a residential area in Owasso, Oklahoma - This was the twin engined plane that Dr. Perry Inhofe was flying in . 'It was fully engulfed when we got there and it looked like the wings had come detached. There were tires popping ... There was nothing we could do.' Dr. Perry Inhofe is an orthopedic surgeon with Central States Orthopedics in Tulsa and received a degree in biomedical engineering and electrical engineering from Duke University in 1984. He is one four children the Senator has with wife Kay Kirkpatrick. Dr. Inhofe has been a commercial pilot since 2009 and was certified as a flight instructor in February of 2012. Senator Inhofe has just recovered from quadruple bypass surgery in October and had only returned to Washington last week after suffering an extreme blockage in five arteries. Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK) speaks during a news conference to announce a plan to defund the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, at the U.S. Capitol in March . Inhofe turns 79 next year and has been in the U.S. Senate since 1994 and is up for re-election in 2014. The venerable politician sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee and is known as one of the more consevative members of Congress. He believes that man-made global warming is a hoax and impossible because 'God's still up there.' In 2006, in an interview with Tulsa World, Inhofe said that environmentalism reminds him of 'the Third Reich'....You say something over and over and over again and people will believe it.' He is also known as a strong supporter of Israel and that its citizens have a right to settle the land around Palestine because it is God given. Inhofe is in favor of a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, against adding sexual orientation to the definition of hate crimes, and he voted against prohibiting job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. As a result he does not hire openly gay staff members because of the possibility of a conflict of interest. He campaigned for his Senate seat in 1994 with the phrase, 'God, guns and gays' and he was seen by the Associated Press to be running an ad with 'anti-gay overtones' when one of his commercial  featured a wedding cake with two male figures atop, blending into his opponent's face. In June of 2006, Inhofe proudly pointed to a photograph of his entire family and claimed on the Senate floor that none of his family were lesbian or gay. Scene: The plane that Inhofe was piloting came down outside Tulsa International Airport and burst into flames . 'As you see here, and I think this is maybe the most important prop we’ll have during the entire debate, my wife and I have been married 47 years. We have 20 kids and grandkids. I'm really proud to say that in the recorded history of our family, we've never had a divorce or any kind of homosexual relationship.' The controversial senator is also infamous for voting against federal disaster relief for states such as New Jersey and New York in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, but arguing for assistance in Oklahoma. He claims that the circumstances between natural disasters in his state and others are totally different and cannot be compared.","Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe's son has perished in an air crash outside Tulsa .

"Tragedy: John W Price, 42, was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, sources say . The leader of Navy SEAL Team Four, one of the most senior commanders in the elite world of special operations, has died after apparently committing suicide in Afghanistan, it was reported today. Commander John W Price, 42, was found dead in his quarters with a gunshot wound on Saturday - just three days before Christmas. Cmdr Price was based in Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia, near Norfolk and had been in the military for more than 23 years. He leaves behind a wife, Stephanie and a nine-year-old daughter Jillian, who both live in Virginia Beach. The commander is originally from Pottstown, Pennsylvania. He commanded six platoons, two-dozen SEAL commandos and numerous support staff,  deployed in Uruzgan Province, where they were conducting counter-terrorism missions and training police in remote parts of the country. SEAL Team Four is one of nine teams of special operations troops. The most famous of the combat groups is the classified SEAL Team Six, which conducted the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011. A U.S. military official said the death 'appears to be the result of suicide.' The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the death is still being investigated. 'The Naval Special Warfare family is deeply saddened by the loss of our teammate,' said Captain Robert Smith, commander of Naval Special Warfare Group Two, which manages all Virginia-based Navy SEAL teams. 'We extend our condolences, thoughts and prayers to the family, friends, and NSW community during this time of grieving.

"Behind bars: Eddie Ray Routh is  charged with two counts of murder after shooting Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a shooting range in Texas . Police now say that the former marine accused of killing the country’s best sniper and another man at a shooting range now says that he threatened to kill himself and his family back in September and he was hospitalized. A police report from the September 2 incident states they were alerted to the threat when they received a call about 25-year-old Eddie Ray Routh, who is now in jail on two murder counts for allegedly killing Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield. ‘Eddie stated he was hurting and that his family does not understand what he has been through,’ the police report says. The Dallas Morning News reports that when officers arrived on the scene they found Eddie walking outside the family home without shoes or a shirt, and smelling like alcohol. His mother said that the argument started when his father said that they were going to take away his gun. ‘She stated Eddie began arguing and stated that he was going to “blow his brains out,”’ the report stated. As it has been previously reported, Routh allegedly told police at the scene that he has post traumatic stress disorder. He was arrested on Saturday evening following the afternoon shooting at the gun range, and while he was reportedly calm during the arrest, his time in jail has not been as smooth. Scroll down for video . Storm: Kyle wrote a graphic memoir, American Sniper, about his four bloody tours of Iraq, released last year . Routh is now tied to a chair in . solitary confinement as prison guards put him on suicide watch after he . started acting aggressive towards guards on Sunday night when he refused . to give them back his food tray. The 25-year-old former soldier was . Tasered by guards at Erath County Jail when he 'was trying to attack . them,' according to ABC News. Routh- who Kyle and Littlefield took . to the range in an effort  to connect with the troubled former soldier . and potentially help him work through his post traumatic stress . disorder- remains in jail on $3million bail. Police caught Routh after he drove off to his sister's house in Kyle's Jeep and confessed to the killings. 'I don't think anybody knows why. They all went out there together,' Erath County Sheriff Tommy Bryant said on Sunday. 'It's my understanding that the . suspect may have been suffering from some type of mental illness from . being in the military himself,' he said of Routh. Scene: The shooting took place at Rough Creek Lodge in Glen Rose, Texas earlier this month . He said Routh's mother may have reached out to Kyle for help with her son. 'We kind of have an idea that maybe . that's why they were at the range for some type of therapy that Mr. Kyle . assists people with,' Mr Bryant said. Bryant didn't know whether Routh was on any medication or whether he had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Authorities say the three men arrived . at the Rough Creek Lodge southwest of Fort Worth around 3.15pm Saturday. A hunting guide discovered the bodies of Kyle and Littlefield around . 5pm and called 911. Both Kyle and Littlefield were shot multiple times, and police found a semi-automatic handgun at Routh’s home. According to the Fort Worth . Star-Telegram, Routh’s mother Jodi had reached out to Mr Kyle, asking . him to help her son overcome his PTSD since he had talked about his . rehabilitation efforts in the past. While in Iraq, Kyle survived being shot twice . and he lived through six separate IED explosions as his unit, Charlie . company of SEAL Team Three, saw significant combat . Kyle recorded more than 150 sniper kills - the most in U.S. military history - between 1999 and 2009 . 'Chris struggled with some things,' said Travis Cox, Kyle’s friend who serves as director of the non-profit . called FITCO that the former sniper started since his retirement. 'He'd been through a lot and he . handled it with grace, but yeah he did struggle with some things. And he . found a healthy outlet and was proactive in his approach to deal with . those issues and wanted to help spread his healing, what worked for him, . to others. And that's what he died doing.' Littlefield, a 35-year-old friend and . neighbor, was Kyle's 'workout buddy,' and also volunteered his time to . work with veterans, Cox said. He was married and had children as well. 'He's a very gentle, sweet-hearted man, just a great man, kind of quiet,' Cox said of Littlefield. Caught: Police searched for Routh for hours following the shooting on Saturday afternoon but he was found after his sister called him in, as he fled to her house in Kyle's pick up truck and proceeded to confess to the killings . Criticism: Former Texas congressman Ron Paul posted a controversial message about the shooting . 'He just really cared. 'He wanted to do whatever he could to . help veterans and help see that vision of serving others that Chris had. He shared that vision with all of us. He was a great man.' Mr Cox said he understood that Kyle . and Littlefield were helping Routh work through his own PTSD and he said . it was not a FITCO session. Very few public figures have spoken . out about Kyle's death, though former Republican presidential candidate . and Texan congressman Ron Paul decided to break his silence on Monday. 'Chris Kyle's death seems to confirm . that ""he who lives by the sword dies by the sword."" Treating PTSD at a . firing range doesn't make sense,' he wrote to his 400,000 followers.","Eddie Ray Routh arrested Saturday for murder of top U.S. sniper Chris Kyle and Kyle's friend Chad Littlefield at a shooting range .

And team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar told local media in Brazil that Neymar will not kick another ball at the finals, expecting his recovery period to be at least four weeks.

"In a makeshift camp a few miles from the border in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, Ibrahim sat in his tent where the dirt floor had turned to mud. Strong winds blew snow in the entrance and children huddled in one corner around a fire in a metal crate. 'The storm will finish us. It's freezing now. I seek refugee in God,' the 27-year-old Syrian refugee told Reuters. Chill: A youngster braces against the cold at a . camp for Syrian refugees in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley after the first . winter snows fell this week, bringing fresh misery to the hundreds . of thousands who have fled the war . Syrian refugees play with snow: This week's . storm, dubbed Alexa, pushed temperatures below freezing in northern . Lebanon and some areas of the Bekaa Valley, which is dotted with . informal refugee settlements . 'This winter promises to be very harsh': Dana Sleiman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees told the Associated Press that at least 80,000 Syrians in Lebanon will spend the winter in tents . The season's first snow settled in parts of Lebanon this week, giving refugee children who have fled the war in Syria the opportunity for a snowball fight outside their tents. But, children's games aside, the winter weather heaped another layer of misery on the already grim existence of many of the estimated one million Syrians in Lebanon who have fled the civil war raging in their homeland. This week's storm, dubbed Alexa, pushed temperatures below freezing in northern Lebanon and some areas of the Bekaa Valley, which is dotted with informal refugee settlements. 'We are extremely concerned for the refugees this winter that promises to be very harsh,' Dana Sleiman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees told The Associated Press. Since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011, more than two million Syrians - at least half of them children - have fled the violence in their homeland to neighboring countries like Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. Many will spend the winter in flimsy tents with often only a plastic sheet covering the ground. Clearing the decks: In Lebanon, more that . 835,000 refugees live in tented camps, unused buildings or with friends . or family, according to UNHCR figures. The government estimates . the true figure to be closer to 1million . Abandoned: Unlike in Turkey, Jordan and Iraq, . the Lebanese government is not providing facilities or land to . temporarily accommodate refugees despite the continuing influx, which . has increased the population by 25% . Ibrahim, who declined to give his last name, says his family does not have enough money for food or to build a sturdier shelter at the camp, which is home to around 1,000 of his compatriots. Outside his tent, men filled bags with dirt to hold down tent shelters and placed car tires and bricks atop the flimsy wooden structures to prevent the wind from tearing them apart. Elsewhere, in another nearby camp in Bekaa, around 200 Syrian refugees live in huts and derelict buildings at the foot of a mountain. They are housed in structures walled with scrap wood and poles, with roofs of plastic sheeting held down with ropes and tyres; they too are slowly freezing to death. Ahmad Hasan, a 25-year-old business studies graduate living there, told The Times: 'We have no heating oil, few warm clothes. We have had to hunt for scraps of wood to keep us warm. It has been terrible in every way.' He said that he and his fellows had been able to find work as agricultural labourers in the summer months, harvesting vegetable crops. 'When we picked potatoes, we kept the bad ones and stored them for winter, so we have something to eat when there is no work,' he said. A man walks with a hammer after fixing plastic . covers on tents: Some Lebanese worry that if official camps are set up . for the Syrian refugees, they could become as established as those . housing Palestinians since 1948 . A Syrian refugee tries to move a washing machine . outside her tent to protect it from snowfall: So for now, aid agencies can help .

In Lebanon, more than 835,000 refugees live in tented camps, unused buildings or with friends or family, according to figures from the UN High Commission for Refugees. The government of the country of just 4.5million people estimates the numbers to be much higher, at around 1million. Unlike in Turkey, Jordan and Iraq, the Lebanese government is not providing facilities or land to temporarily accommodate refugees despite the continuing influx, which has effectively increased the population of the country by 25 per cent. Many Syrians in Lebanon live in . appalling conditions, finding shelter in slums, tents and tin shacks . strung with laundry lines and wedged between farmland outside towns and . cities. In the capital, . Beirut, many Syrians live in underground parking lots, under bridges and . on old construction sites with no running water, sanitation, . electricity or protection from Lebanon's sizzling summers and its . freezing winters. The country has a troubled history of hosting refugees. Palestinian families who were forced from their homeland in 1948 by the newly established state of Israel still live in squalid refugee camps across Lebanon. Their presence was seen by some as disrupting Lebanon's delicate sectarian balance and a contributing factor in the 1975 to 1990 civil war that devastated the country. Now some Lebanese worry that if official camps are set up for the latest flood of refugees from Syria, they too could become as established as those housing Palestinians. So, for now, aid agencies can help the Syrian newcomers with food, tents, blankets and clothes but they cannot set up formal refugee camps. Young Syrian refugees build a snowman: Simon Ingram of UNICEF said the agency has been able to mobilise winter supplies for Syrians in Lebabon but 'the needs will outstrip what we are able to provide' Smiling through hardship: The start of winter coincides with a polio vaccination campaign that seeks to vaccinate 750,000 children in Lebanon after an outbreak of the disease was confirmed in eastern Syria in October . A young Syrian refugee girl carries a blanket: Lebanese Minister for Social Affairs Wael Abu Faour said the government was 'trying its best' and that the army had been called in to make refugee shelters ready for winter . Ibrahim, who arrived last week, said the aid is not sufficient for the new arrivals. 'We . came here in the winter but it would have been better if we had stayed . in Syria. At least if you die, you die in your own house,' he said. In . Marj, a Lebanese town near the border with Syria, refugees on Wednesday . were piling up extra layers of plastic bags and tarps supplied by the . UNHCR in an effort to reinforce their tents. 'I . don't know if this tent will hold up, it's just a few flimsy pieces of . metal holding it up,' said Abu Suleiman, eyeing his tent with worry. Abu . Suleiman, who only agreed to give his nickname, has lived in the . settlement with about 40 other families since fleeing the Damascus . suburb of Jisreen five months ago with little more than the clothes on . his back. Ms Sleiman of the UNHCR said that at least 80,000 Syrians in Lebanon will spend the winter in tents. With . no end to the conflict in sight and dwindling international support to . help Syria's neighbors cover the costs and burden of providing for . influx, many of the refugees now worry about how they are going to . survive the winter. 'We . used to be scared of wolves coming inside the tents at night,' said Umm . Mohammad, a 45-year-old refugee from the contested Damascus suburb of . Daraya. 'Now there's so much more to worry about. ... How will we . survive the winter?' Simon Ingram, a spokesman for the U.N. Children's Fund, said the agency has been able to mobilise winter supplies for Syrians in Lebabon and elsewhere but 'the needs will outstrip what we and our partners are able to provide.' The start of winter coincides with a polio vaccination campaign that seeks to vaccinate 750,000 children in Lebanon after an outbreak of the disease was confirmed in eastern Syria in October. 'Polio spreads through water and sewage,' Ingram said. 'This is one the big dangers - overflowing drains.' Chief of Lebanon's Meteorological Department, Mark Whaybeh, said that in past years, snow and rainfall had increased and temperatures decreased over December and into January. 'We are still at the beginning of the season,' he said. 'We should have rain and cold periods during the next two months.' Mr Whaybeh said Alexa will last until tomorrow night and that temperatures could plummet to minus-7C in some mountainous areas of Lebanon. Minister for Social Affairs Wael Abu Faour said the government was 'trying its best' and that the army had been called in to make refugee shelters ready for winter. He told Reuters his main worry was that some refugees are living in a flood area near the Litani river.' Abu Faour said he was trying to rehouse refugees near the river, which flooded during storms in January but that so far there was no place available. 'It's beyond our capacity,' he said. 'We tried mosques, we tried schools, we have tried everything. It will be a disaster.'","Eastern region near the Syrian border struck by snowstorms this week .

"Steven Gerrard has been a magnificent leader of Liverpool through good times and hard and has striven mightily for England in the teeth of adversity. In terms of one-clubmanship this exemplary footballer stands just below Sir Tom Finney, the greatest of all English players who devoted his lifetime to Preston. When his country called, Stevie G never failed to answer with every sinew and fibre of his being. VIDEO Scroll down to see Steven Gerrard's Liverpool career highlights . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has announced he will leave the club when his contract expires this summer . Gerrard has made 695 appearances and scored 180 goals for Liverpool since making his debut in 1998 . Premier League: 494 appearances, 116 goals . FA Cup: 39 appearances, 13 goals . League Cup: 28 appearances, 9 goals . Champions League: 87 appearances, 30 goals . UEFA Cup/Europa League: 42 appearances, 11 goals . Other: 5 appearances, 1 goal . TOTAL: 695 appearances, 180 goals . From which I hope you, and he, will gather the esteem in which I hold one of the proudest Merseysiders ever to wear the Anfield red. Gerrard will head west this summer – not quite into the sunset just yet but as distant as Los Angeles – as a distinguished ambassador for this, the mother country of the world game. Liverpool will spend the intervening months in celebration of one of their finest, then go into mourning at his departure. As they should. English football at large will share in the nostalgia. But the placing of Gerrard in the history of our national game is more complicated than this immediate sense of loss. However moderate the strength of the Liverpool and England teams he has graced, the poignant reality is that he falls tantalisingly just short of the greatest, even in the pantheon of midfield. The Champions League miracle-worker of Istanbul ought to have delivered more across the spectrum of the domestic game. In part that was because he stayed true to Liverpool while others, his peer Frank Lampard among them, sought fame through transfer. Gerrard, pictured celebrating against Fulham last season, almost helped the Reds to the Premier League title . Gerrard (left), pictured in action against Italy at the World Cup, retired from England duty last summer . One-club men are unlikely to harvest as many trophies. In their honesty – and Gerrard has a heart as big as the Kop - they also end up trying too hard, endeavouring to do too much in the context of their team. As he did at times with England. The bizarre failure of any England manager to effectively harness Gerrard and Lampard into a midfield partnership potentially powerful enough to lift at least a European Championship was rooted in the end in Stevie G’s reluctance to be confined mostly to the anchor-man role. That would have been the natural balancing act with Lampard’s more prolific goalscoring but Gerrard always felt he had more to give and at times over-reached himself. Then Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez (right) holds aloft the Champions League trophy with Gerrard in 2005 . Gerrard lifts the FA Cup in May 2006 after a dramatic win against West Ham at the Millennium Stadium . That loss of footing against Chelsea which caused Liverpool to stumble so fatefully on the threshold of last season’s Premier League title should not be held against the captain without whom they would never have got that close. The most profound loss was his own, condemning him never to win that championship he so richly deserved. But in a symbolic sense that slip puts into a freeze-frame the reason why he comes no higher than tenth in this list of the greatest English midfielders of all time which, to Liverpool chagrin no doubt, is topped by four of Manchester United’s finest: . 1) SIR BOBBY CHARLTON . World Cup winner extraordinaire and still this country’s leading goalscorer . Manchester United and England legend Sir Bobby Charlton (right) in action against Arsenal in 1968 . 2) BRYAN ROBSON . Captain Marvel for both Manchester United and England. 3) DUNCAN EDWARDS . Rated by Charlton as greater than himself and may well have proved him right but for his premature death among other Busby Babes in the Munich air disaster. 4) PAUL SCHOLES . The most deft feet to be allied to a computer of a brain in the modern era. Paul Scholes enjoyed an illustrious career with Manchester United before hanging up his boots in 2013 . 5) JOHNNY HAYNES . The sublime passer who invented, with Fulham and England, the diagonal cross-field ball behind the full back and in so doing became this country’s first £100-a-week footballer. 6) PAUL GASCOIGNE . The genius of this age, albeit ultimately the self-destructor of his own magical talent. 7) WILF MANNION . The Pied Piper of Middlesbrough who would have won many more trophies with his club and played dozen more games for England had he not spent World War 11 fighting for his country. Paul Gascoigne (right), pictured in action for Tottenham against Man United, was a magician with the ball . 8) RAICH CARTER . The Sunderland ball conjuror who was the darling of the north-east. 9) FRANK LAMPARD .

"It's been one hell of a rollercoaster year for Manchester United, who started the year hopelessly with one manager and end it somewhat optimistically with another. Kicking off 2014 with FA Cup and League Cup elimination, David Moyes' six-year contract as boss at Old Trafford was continually questioned as United looked a shadow of their former selves under Sir Alex Ferguson's compatriot replacement. Following Moyes' sacking in April United appear to be revitalised under former Holland manager Louis van Gaal, who joined in the summer and broke the British transfer record with the signing of Angel Di Maria. Rajvir Rai reviews the year for Manchester United. David Moyes started the year under a dark cloud as he struggled as Sir Alex Ferguson's successor . JANUARY . A month that very much set the tone for the rest of David Moyes’ doomed reign saw Manchester United crash out of the FA Cup (losing to Swansea at Old Trafford at the first hurdle) and the Capital One Cup (losing on penalties against Sunderland). A humbling 3-1 defeat against Chelsea in the middle of the month left the reigning champions 14 points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal. The £37.1million signing of Juan Mata from Chelsea, however, did provide some cause for optimism. Despite a poor run in form Moyes dipped into the January transfer market by signing Juan Mata from Chelsea . FEBRUARY . Despite the addition of Mata, United still could not click into top gear and managed a single win – a 2-0 victory at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace. United’s struggles were best summed up in the 2-2 home draw against Fulham, which saw Darren Bent score in ‘Fergie Time’ for the visitors – a sign that Old Trafford was no longer the fortress of old. Amazingly, Moyes’ side put in 81 crosses during the game, with Fulham’s Dan Burn saying afterward: ‘I’ve (not) headed that many balls since the Conference!’ On the plus side, Wayne Rooney ended speculation over his future by signing a new five-and-a-half-year contract. Mata's inclusion failed to inject much impetus into the flailing Manchester United squad as they drew to Fulham . United did have some positive news to tell fans as Wayne Rooney signed a new contract at Old Trafford . MARCH . Two successive 3-0 home defeats against Liverpool and Manchester City piled the pressure on Moyes. A 3-0 victory over Olympiakos secured United’s place in the Champions League quarter finals, but the atmosphere around certain sections of Old Trafford seemed to be growing more toxic. Marouane Fellaini’s substitution during the Manchester derby was greeted with loud applause and during the next home game, a 4-1 victory over Aston Villa, a plane carrying an anti-Moyes banner flew over the ground – though it was booed by the large sections of the home fans. United ended the month 15 points off leaders Chelsea and 10 behind Arsenal in fourth. Trust in Moyes hit an all-time low when a seemingly clueless United side fell at home to rivals Liverpool . Certain fans at Old Trafford grew frustrated with Moyes as United also lost 3-0 to neighbours Manchester City . Yaya Toure (left) and Edin Dzeko (right) celebrate goals in City's convincing victory at Old Trafford in March . APRIL . After just 10 months in job, Moyes – who was given a six-year contract after replacing Sir Alex Ferguson – was sacked. Ironically the nail in the coffin was delivered by his former club Everton who eased to a comfortable 2-0 win on the Scot’s first return to Goodison Park. Earlier in the month, United crashed out of the Champions League as they were beaten 3-1 (4-2 on agg) by Bayern Munich, despite taking a surprise lead in the Allianz Arena through Patrice Evra. Ryan Giggs took over as interim manager and started his reign with a thumping 4-0 home win over Norwich. By April it was decided that enough was enough and David Moyes was sacked as Manchester United manager . Red Devils legend Ryan Giggs was appointed as interim manager, winning his first game by thrashing Norwich . MAY . The euphoria of the Giggs era – which also saw former Class of ’92 members Phil Neville, Nicky Butty and Paul Scholes take prominent roles on the coaching staff – was punctured by a 1-0 home defeat to Sunderland. In what proved to be Giggs’ farewell game at Old Trafford – a 3-1 win over Hull – there were debuts for youngsters Tom Lawrence and James Wilson. A 1-1 draw with Southampton on the final day saw United finish 22 points behind champions City in seventh – their worst Premier League finish. Eight days after the season finished, Louis van Gaal was appointed as manager with Giggs as his assistant. In May the Premier League title was painfully handed back over to the blue side of Manchester . JUNE . With the Premier League over all eyes were on the World Cup and Van Gaal’s Holland to see what lay ahead at Old Trafford. Back in Manchester, chief executive Ed Woodward, under pressure after a botched summer 12 months earlier, swung into action as United announced the signings of Ander Herrera for £29m from Athletic Bilbao and Luke Shaw from Southampton for £30m. Alexander Buttner became the first casualty of the new era, leaving for Dynamo Moscow as speculation grew as to how Van Gaal would transform his squad. United chief Ed Woodward began the spending spree by bringing in Luke Shaw (left) and Ander Herrera (right) JULY . With the World Cup over, Van Gaal arrived for his first day of work at Carrington on the 16th. By this point stalwarts Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra, as well as a number of fringe players, had left and United were being linked with a who’s who of football: Arturo Vidal, Mats Hummels and even Cristiano Ronaldo. The Dutchman’s first press conference will be remembered for his plea that it will take three months for his new squad to understand his philosophy. But Van Gaal’s first game was a thumping 7-0 friendly win over LA Galaxy and was followed by victories over Roma and Inter Milan. July said goodbye to Manchester United defensive stalwarts Rio Ferdinand (top) and Nemanja Vidic . Left back Patrice Evra was another experienced player to leave Old Trafford, joining Juventus in July . Louis van Gaal returned from the World Cup after his Holland side reached the semi-finals of the competition . AUGUST . United’s impressive pre-season form continued with victories over Real Madrid, Liverpool and Valencia. The new era was well and truly under way as United lined up in an unfamiliar 3-5-2 formation and Rooney was appointed the club’s new captain. Optimism abounded after such an impressive pre-season, but the mood quickly changed as Swansea ruined the party on the opening day of the season, winning 2-1 at Old Trafford in Van Gaal’s first competitive game in charge. Two league draws against Burnley and Sunderland followed, as well as a humbling 4-0 defeat in the Capital One Cup to MK Dons. United again dipped into the transfer market, adding Argentine duo Marcos Rojo and Angel Di Maria for a combined £66m. United's pre-season started well with a win over Real Madrid in front of 109,318 fans at the Michigan Stadium . Van Gaal continued the spending by bringing in Marcos Rojo (left) and Angel Di Maria for a combined £66million . SEPTEMBER . September started with a bang as Radamel Falcao arrived on loan from Monaco and Daley Blind signed for £14m from Ajax – taking United’s summer spending to £160m - but academy product Danny Welbeck was sold to rivals Arsenal. At the fourth time of asking, Van Gaal finally got his first win as United thumped QPR 4-0 at Old Trafford. A week later, however, they were embarrassed again as they lost 5-3 to Leicester – squandering a 3-1 lead. United’s injury worries continued as Van Gaal was forced to turn to youngsters Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair in the absence of Shaw, Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling. Star signing Radamel Falcao and Dutch World Cup star Daley Blind also joined the United ranks in September . Leicester City brought United back down to earth after coming back from 3-1 down to win the game 5-3 . OCTOBER . With no European or Capital One Cup football, United only played three times in October, stealing last-minute points against West Brom and Chelsea after beating Everton at home – a game notable for Falcao scoring his first goal for the club. After nine games, Van Gaal’s side sat ninth with 13 points – one fewer than Moyes had at the same stage the season before. October marked Falcao's first goal for the Reds with this finish to beat former United goalkeeper Tim Howard . NOVEMBER . Defeat in the Manchester derby – courtesy of a Sergio Aguero strike and a first-half Chris Smalling red card - meant it was United’s worst start to a season since 1986. Level on points with West Brom and Newcastle, Van Gaal’s side were already 13 points behind league leaders Chelsea. But three wins on the bounce against Crystal Palace, Arsenal and Hull lifted United into the Champions League places. Two clean sheets in four games were a welcome boost after United’s defence had been so porous earlier in the season. More questions began to be asked about the United back line when Chris Smalling saw red against City . Sergio Aguero scored the only goal of the day as United's city rivals took the lead just after the hour mark . DECEMBER . United’s good form extended into the Christmas period with wins over Stoke, Southampton, Liverpool and Newcastle and draws at Aston Villa and Tottenham – meaning United finished 2014 on a nine-game unbeaten run. The upturn in form had sparked talk of a title a challenge – notably from senior players such as Rooney and Carrick – but Van Gaal’s side were still 10 points behind league leaders Chelsea and just three points ahead of Southampton and Arsenal in fourth and fifth. With the January transfer window set to open, United were again being linked with big money moves – notably a £120m move for Gareth Bale. After an eventful year United have again been linked to big money signings - Is the future red for Gareth Bale?","Manchester United started 2014 badly with FA and League Cup elimination .

"Tributes have poured in for the actor Richard Kiel, best known for his role as the steel-toothed villain Jaws in two 1970s James Bond films, who died yesterday aged 74. The statuesque 7ft 2in actor portrayed the mercenary assassin Jaws in the 1977 movie The Spy Who Loved Me and the 1979 thriller Moonraker both opposite Sir Roger Moore as Agent 007.

Kiel was a patient at Saint Agnes . Medical Center and his death was confirmed by Kelley Sanchez, director . of communications at the hospital. The towering star recently broke his leg and received treatment at the medical center, according to TMZ. A cause of death has not yet been reported.

He . also portrayed a prisoner who played a bruising game of football . against the guards in the 1974 film The Longest Yard starring Burt . Reynolds and was a killer in the 1976 comedy Silver Streak starring Gene . Wilder and Richard Pryor. His character Jaws ranks among the top Bond villains alongside Goldfinger, Ernst Stavro Blofeld and Rosa Klebb. Jaws . was known for his enormous size and strength plus those sharp steel . teeth that he could use to bite through cables and to chomp on the neck . of his victims. Larger than life: Jaws with his towering height and metal teeth proved a formidable villain in The Spy Who Loved Me and again in Moonraker . Moore, who played the fictional British secret agent in seven films, wrote an August 2012 article in MailOnline about his favourite Bond villains. 'The . most memorable of all, however, has to be Jaws, sidekick to the evil . Karl Stromberg in The Spy Who Loved Me,' Moore, 86, wrote in the . article. 'Jaws was . played by my good friend Richard Kiel, who stands 7ft 2½ in. Jaws got . his name from the ominous, glinting steel teeth he wore, of course. Poor . devil, they were so uncomfortable to wear – Richard could only keep . them in for about half a minute at a time,' Moore wrote. Bond movie producer Albert R. Broccoli has been credited with adding steel teeth to the Jaws character for The Spy Who Loved Me. Mercenary assassin: Kiel is shown reprising his role as Jaws in Moonraker . The teeth were designed as cog-like in shape as it was believed pointy teeth would injure Kiel. When Jaws was required to bite through something, liquorice was use. Jaws only had one line in both of his appearances in the Bond franchise. 'Well, here's to us,' he said at the end of Moonraker as he opened a bottle of champagne with his girlfriend Dolly. Sad time: Adam Sandler, pictured on Saturday, made a statement about his Happy Gilmore co-star . Gentle giant: Richard, shown in May 2013 in London, was described by Moore as 'so kind, so gentle' His character was inspired by Bond author . Ian Fleming's description of a villain named Horror who revealed . steel-capped teeth while speaking in the novel The Spy Who Loved Me. Earlier this year, Kiel told the Daily Mail: 'To this day, I go out in sunglasses and a hat because people will shout ""Hey, Jaws!"" at me from across the street. 'The only way I can explain it is that he's like the Road Runner, which Coyote keeps trying to blow up, but he keeps going.'

Relaxed: The actor, who was born in Detroit, Michigan, and his wife Diane smile happily with their children during a 1982 photo shoot . Before finding fame as a Bond villain, Kiel got his career breakthrough starring as Voltaire to Dr. Miguelito Loveless in The Wild, Wild West in 1965. Born in Detroit, Michigan, Kiel made his acting debut in the television series Laramie, in an episode titled Street Of Hate. He suffered a severe head injury in a 1992 car accident that affected his balance and forced him to walk with a cane, as shown in his appearances in Happy Gilmore, or use a scooter to get around. Moore in his 2009 memoir My Word Is My Bond described how Kiel was starkly different from his Jaws character. 'Richard is so kind, so gentle,' Moore wrote of his co-star. On set: Kiel was joined by his wife Diane and their son Richard on the set of The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977, left, and plays happily on a swing with Richard and his three other children in 1982 . Kiel's abnormal height and distinct features were a result of a hormonal condition called acromegaly that is often associated with gigantism.

"Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has been given the perfect medical advice to ensure he does not see any criticism of his management - by being banned from reading the newspaper by his doctor! The Calatans drew 0-0 away at Gefafe on Saturday and a section of Barca supporters have criticised Enrique for his constant tinkering of team selection and formations. But Enrique insists he is not concerned by the criticism and, in fact, he has not even seen the majority of it due to his ban on reading about it in the press on medical grounds.

"In a sweltering Miami afternoon, hundreds of guys are sitting in an airless hotel reception room taking notes, hanging on every utterance by the speaker. They’ve paid up to $3000 to be here – to learn from the master himself. On the podium at the front isn’t a religious guru. It isn’t a business leader imparting the secrets of getting rich. It’s a guy dressed in jeans and an unironed shirt – teaching men what should be the most natural thing of all: how to talk to women. Scroll down for video . The master: Julien Blanc is a dating coach at Real Social Dynamics and commands fees of up to $3,000 to teach men his secrets . Julien Blanc, 25, is one of the most renowned 'pick-up artists' around. As a dating coach for Real Social Dynamics, the company founded by Tyler Durden (Owen Cook) and Papa (Nick Kho), Mr Blanc and his colleagues have near-rock star status amongst the men who’ve traveled from across the U.S. – earnestly writing down every insight on how to make yourself more attractive to women, and how no woman is beyond you. 'Why on earth would you need an excuse to talk to a girl?' Mr Blanc thunders from the front of the room. Scores of baseball caps nod, pencils scribble. I’ve joined the disciples for a weekend’s bootcamp as part of my TV show, Tim Samuels: The Hunt for Real Men, which explores what it’s like to be a man today. Taking notes: The author Tim Samuels traveled to Miami, Florida to learn Mr Blanc's secrets of how to pick up women . Closing the deal: As part of the bootcamp, Mr Samuels was forced to interact with female strangers in public and ask for phone numbers . How has it come to this, that men have to pay to learn how to meet women? I sit through the lectures feeling a little smug and incredulous that guys are paying serious cash for a bit of confidence boosting and common sense. 1. Never walk directly towards a woman - approach from the side as it's less threatening . 2. Don't mumble - speak as though you're on stage doing a spot of Shakespeare . 3. Don't hang around like a bad smell . 4. Try and take the woman away from her group to talk somewhere quiet . 5. Don't leave without getting a phone number . But then we’re told that after lunch . we’ve moving from the theory to the practical – chatting up total . strangers on the street. The dread kicks in. For a British bloke, the idea of walking up to a woman on the street, mid-afternoon, entirely sober and having to chat her up with the aim of getting her phone number is a living nightmare. Committing armed robbery or heading on holiday to northern Syria would be less terrifying. What on earth would you say as an opening line? How would you not sound like a complete cheese ball? Before I can bail out, Mr Blanc leads a small group of us down to the main pedestrianized shopping street. 1. Don't speak to groups of models about woollen socks . 2. Check for a wedding ring first . 3. Check for a pram first . 4. Do give up when the woman doesn't speak a word of English . 5. Don't fight your national upbringing - drink at least four pints of lager before attempting any interaction . Women . are going about their business – catching up with friends over coffee, . popping into shops, heading to fashion week events, and generally . displaying no inclination to want to be bothered by men who are paying . good money to learn how to bother them. As a few of us hang back, he demonstrates that he’s not all talk. He brazenly heads over to Starbucks . where a woman is stood outside, walks up to her, asks her where she’s . from and gets chatting. Just as that’s going well, another woman walks . past on her way into a store – he stops her, and then brings her into . the conversation. A . classic technique - which demonstrates manly confidence, engenders a . spot of competition and creates that all-important vibe that 'you’re at . the center of your own party'. Lo and behold, the second woman then asks for his number and what he’s doing that night. Astonishing stuff. And sober. Lining up: The author sat in a room packed with men who paid $3,000 each to learn how to interact with women . Buoyed by this display of manliness, I’m sent off to do my own stranger-bothering. The first girl I approach doesn’t speak a word of English. She sounds Russian. I deploy my full repertoire (‘glasnost’ and ‘perestroika’) – but she remains impassive. I’m then directed to a pair of women . who are having coffee. One has a pram. Neither has any time for me. Before I’d even opened my mouth, they raise a hand – traffic cop style – . to signal don’t even think of approaching. Down but not out, I’m pushed towards two models – who at least don’t raise any limbs towards me. What . then follows is two minutes of dire conversation, where all I can think . to ask about is where to buy socks around here, and bore myself into . submission, like a football player signalling to the coach that he wants . to come off the field. In the field: Mr Blanc demonstrates how to master the game by getting a woman's attention . Training tactics: Mr Blanc coaches his students to develop enough confidence to approach complete strangers . Gaining confidence: The men are coached through a series of scenarios and told to visualize themselves being at the center of their own party . With confidence shot to pieces, I make my final approach – to a waitress taking a break. After some initial confusion about where she came from – ‘Barcelona’ and ‘Macedonia’ can be easily confused – we manage a nice chat for a few minutes about former Yugoslavia and cocktails, before I plump up the courage to ask for a phone number. Which she actually gives me. I head off with a renewed sense of swagger – and faith in the American can-do approach to all aspects of life. It was only when my director goes back to interview her that we notice a wedding ring on her finger. She’d given me her number out of politeness. You wouldn’t get that in Britain.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has blamed England for Daniel Sturridge's injury, criticising the international side's coaching and recovery methods. The Liverpool striker missed England's 2-0 win over Switzerland after picking up a knock in training and returning to Merseyside. Sturridge will now miss Liverpool's clash with Aston Villa on Saturday, as well as the Champions League tie against Ludogorets on Tuesday. WATCH Scroll down for 'Rodgers: Sturridge has best 50 game record in Liverpool history' Daniel Sturridge was injured on England duty, much to the annoyance of Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers . Daniel Sturridge in training for England against Phil Jones just before going down injured . But Rodgers thinks the injury could have been prevented and questioned the approach of England's coaching and medical staff. He told talkSPORT: 'We're disappointed because we feel it's an injury which could have been prevented. Clubs work differently to international teams, it's the recovery strategy. 'When we look at our players here, we look at them individually, in terms of what their needs are.' Rodgers added: 'Some players are very fast, they will have a second day, active recovery, whereas other players can work on that [second] day. Daniel Sturridge played in the friendly against Norway at Wembley, which England won 1-0 . Daniel Sturridge could be out for up to two weeks but should return for the Merseyside derby . 'When you're a type of player like Raheem Sterling or Daniel Sturridge, you need to recover them differently.' Liverpool face a busy schedule in September with West Ham next up after Ludogorets, followed by a Capital One Cup tie against Middlesbrough and the Merseyside derby against Everton on September 27. 'He's one to two weeks away [from playing again],' Rodgers added on Sturridge.

"Scientists working on the most authoritative study on climate change were urged to cover up the fact that the world’s temperature hasn’t risen for the last 15 years, it is claimed. A leaked copy of a United Nations report, compiled by hundreds of scientists, shows politicians in Belgium, Germany, Hungary and the United States raised concerns about the final draft. Published next week, it is expected to address the fact that 1998 was the hottest year on record and world temperatures have not yet exceeded it, which scientists have so far struggled to explain. The report is the result of six years’ work by UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is seen as the world authority on the extent of climate change and what is causing it – on which governments including Britain’s base their green policies. Concerns: Scientists have been urged to cover up the fact that the Earth's temperature hasn't risen for the last 15 years amid fears it would provide ammunition for deniers of man-made climate change . But leaked documents seen by the Associated Press, yesterday revealed deep concerns among politicians about a lack of global warming over the past few years. Germany called for the references to the slowdown in warming to be deleted, saying looking at a time span of just 10 or 15 years was ‘misleading’ and they should focus on decades or centuries. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has changed its tune after issuing stern warnings about climate change for years . Hungary worried the report would provide ammunition for deniers of man-made climate change. Belgium objected to using 1998 as a starting year for statistics, as it was exceptionally warm and makes the graph look flat - and suggested using 1999 or 2000 instead to give a more upward-pointing curve. The United States delegation even weighed in, urging the authors of the report to explain away the lack of warming using the ‘leading hypothesis’ among scientists that the lower warming is down to more heat being absorbed by the ocean – which has got hotter. The last IPCC ‘assessment report’ was published in 2007 and has been the subject of huge controversy after it had to correct the embarrassing claim that the Himalayas would melt by 2035. It was then engulfed in the ‘Climategate’ scandal surrounding leaked emails allegedly showing scientists involved in it trying to manipulate their data to make it look more convincing – although several inquiries found no wrongdoing. The latest report, which runs to 2,000 pages, will be shown to representatives from all 195 governments next week at a meeting in Stockholm, who can discuss alterations they want to make. But since it was issued to governments in June, they have raised hundreds of objections about the 20-page summary for policymakers, which sums up the findings of the scientists. What it says will inform renewable energy policies and how much consumers and businesses will pay for them. The report is expected to say the rate of warming between 1998 and 2012 was about half of the average rate since 1951 – and put this down to natural variations such as the El Nino and La Nina ocean cycles and the cooling effects of volcanoes. A leaked copy of the United Nations report, compiled by hundreds of scientists, shows politicians in Belgium, Germany, Hungary and the United States have raised concerns about the final draft. Above, the United Nations headquarters building in New York . A German climate scientist - Stefan Rahmstorf, who reviewed the chapter on sea levels - yesterday admitted it was possible the report’s authors were feeling under pressure to address the slowdown in warming due to the ‘public debate’ around the issue. The draft report, which is not new research but a synthesis of all the work being done by scientists around the world, is likely to be highly disputed at the three-day meeting. It will make the case that humans are causing global warming with carbon emissions even more strongly upgrading it from ‘very likely’ in 2007 to ‘extremely likely’ it is manmade. But scientists are under pressure to explain why the warming has not exceeded 1998 levels although the decade 2000-2010 was the hottest on record. Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists based in Washington, said yesterday: ‘I think to not address it would be a problem because then you basically have the denialists saying: ‘Look the IPCC is silent on this issue.’ Jonathan Lynn, a spokesman for the IPCC said yesterday: ‘This is the culmination of four years’ work by hundreds of scientists, where governments get a chance to ensure the summary for policymakers is clear and concise in a dialogue with the scientists who wrote it, and have the opportunity to raise any topics they think should be highlighted.’","Leaked United Nations report reveals the world's temperature hasn't risen for the last 15 years .

"Click here to see Nos 50-41 . Click here to see Nos 40-31 . Click here to see Nos 30-21 . The centre forward: The leader from the front, the No 9, the provider, the talisman, the goalscorer. Since 1992, the Premier League has been blessed with the best, from homegrown talents Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, to foreign imports Tony Yeboah and Thierry Henry. In this international week, we are begging for goals, and these lot put the ball in the back of the net and make it look easy. Here, Sportsmail runs you through Nos 20-11 of the best strikers to have ever graced the Premier League... do you agree? 20. Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) Still in the prime of his career, there’s every chance Sergio Aguero could end up higher in this list if we were to re-visit it in five years' time. But 64 goals in 98 league outings for Manchester City isn’t a bad start. City paid a pretty penny - £38m - for the Argentine’s service back in 2011 but he didn’t waste any time making an impression, scoring a 30-yarder on debut against Swansea. And, of course, his dramatic last-gasp goal against QPR to win City the title will never be forgotten. He is arguably the best striker in the Premier League at the moment, as 12 goals in 11 games so far this season in an otherwise shaky team have testified. Sergio Aguero has been a hit for Manchester City ever since his £38m move from Atletico Madrid in 2011 . Aguero scored a dramatic late winner against QPR to help City win the Premier League title in 2012 ahead of Manchester United . 19. Carlos Tevez (West Ham, Manchester United, Manchester City) From one Argentine hotshot to another, Tevez dragged West Ham to Premier League survival in 2007 with seven priceless goals, including the winner at Old Trafford on the final day of the season. His move to Manchester United that summer was protracted but Tevez was an instant favourite, winning hearts for his committed and high-energy performances. Sir Alex Ferguson bought him to score important goals and that’s what he did, especially in his first season when he ended up a Premier League and Champions League winner. Calls to 'sign him up' fell on deaf ears and Tevez joined rivals City, prompting the famous 'Welcome to Manchester' billboard. Tevez struck 23 and then 20 league goals in his first two seasons, and netted 58 times in all before leaving for Juventus. Carlos Tevez helped West Ham avoid relegation from the Premier League after joining from Brazilian side Corinthians . Tevez played for both Manchester giants, the highlight of which being his two Premier League titles with United in 2008 and 2009 . 18. Luis Suarez (Liverpool) Some would argue with his racism and biting controversies, Suarez should be nowhere near this list. But we’re hear to talk purely about goals and 69 Premier League strikes in 110 matches for Liverpool means there is certainly a place. This was the man who powered Liverpool to within touching distance of their first post-1992 title last season with 31 goals. And the season before that, he claimed 30. Suarez averaged a hat-trick every 20 games, the best rate of all the players to have score more than one treble in the Premier League. Aided by Daniel Sturridge, he smashed all kinds of records last season and, despite adversity, won the Golden Boot and the PFA Player of the Year award. Luis Suarez scored 31 goals last season to lead Liverpool to the brink of the Premier League title . The Uruguayan was named PFA Player of the Year and sealed a £75m dream move to Barcelona in the summer . 17. Stan Collymore (Nottingham Forest, Liverpool, Aston Villa, Leicester City, Bradford City) One of the Premier League’s finest strikers of the mid- to late-Nineties, Collymore scored a remarkable 41 goals in 65 league appearances for Nottingham Forest and 28 in 64 for Liverpool. After helping Forest back up to the top division in 1994, Collymore’s 22 goals helped them to an unexpected third-place finish. Forging an irrepressible strike partnership with Robbie Fowler, he averaged a goal every 2.5 games for Liverpool and created many more. His dramatic late winner against Newcastle United, destroying their titles hopes in 1996, will never be forgotten. Stan Collymore scores a dramatic late winner against Newcastle in Liverpool's famous 4-3 win in 1996 . Collymore scored 41 goals in 65 league outings for Nottingham Forest and helped them back into England's top-flight . 16. Matt Le Tissier (Southampton) The ultimate one-club man, Le Tissier’s record of 100 Premier League goals and 209 overall for Southampton rivals any attacker. He was already an established goalscorer by the time the Premier League was formed in 1992 and continued in the rich vein afterwards. He had an uncanny ability to score classy goals - that immaculate control and blistering finish against Newcastle in 1993 sticks in the memory. Oh and the touch, swivel and 30-yard volley later in the match. His awesome penalty record must not be overlooked either - unfazed by pressure, he scored all but one of his spot-kicks. Little wonder he is worshipped as 'Le God' on the south coast. Matt Le Tissier scored 209 goals for Southampton during his 16 years with the south coast club . Le Tissier shoots against Manchester United in 1996 on a day Southampton won 3-1 but the match is better remembered for THAT kit . 15. Dwight Yorke (Aston Villa, Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers, Birmingham, Sunderland) With his smile and relaxed gait, Yorke is probably the most laid-back striker on this list but when it came to the business of scoring goals, he was deadly serious. The hotshot from Tobago first shot to prominence at Aston Villa, converting to a striker in the 1995-1996 season and helping Villa to League Cup success. In all, he scored 73 league goals for the club both before and after 1992. Yorke joined Manchester United in 1998 and was the missing piece in Ferguson’s jigsaw as his haul of 29 goals and telepathic partnership with Andy Cole ended in Treble glory. He continued to score at a prodigious rate for United, helping them to a further two Premier League titles in 2000 and 2001. Dwight Yorke scored 73 league goals for Aston Villa and helped them to League Cup success before moving to Manchester United . Yorke moved to Manchester United and formed a formidable strike partnership with Andy Cole (right) 14. Gianfranco Zola (Chelsea) The man Claudio Ranieri described as a ‘wizard’ and Alex Ferguson called a ‘clever little so-and-so’ was the star of Chelsea’s first cosmopolitan team in the late Nineties. His £4.5m price tag proved a bargain and he helped Ruud Gullit’s team to FA Cup glory in 1997, as well as the League Cup and European Cup-Winners’ Cup the following season. Gloriously skilful and a regular goalscorer, he was adored by the Chelsea faithful, who voted him their best-ever player in a 2003 survey. In all, he scored 59 goals in 229 league matches for the Blues. His audacious mid-air back heel against Norwich in the FA Cup in 2002 was the pick of his goals. Gianfranco Zola (right) was described as a 'wizard' by Claudio Raniero and a 'clever little so-and-so' by Sir Alex Ferguson . Zola scores a wonder goal against Norwich with an audacious flick in an FA Cup tie in 2002 . 13. Teddy Sheringham (Nottingham Forest, Tottenham, Manchester United, Portsmouth, West Ham) Sheringham’s professional career spanned an incredible 24 years, giving plenty of time to fit in his grand total of 355 goals. His first Premier League involvement was with Forest, briefly, and then Tottenham, with whom he became the maiden season’s top scorer in 1992-1993. He continued to score at a furious rate before moving to Manchester United for £3.5m in 1997 as the replacement for Eric Cantona. The success and silverware that eluded him for most of his career quickly arrived, with three Premier League title wins, an FA Cup and the Champions League. He famously scored United’s last-gasp equaliser in the final with Bayern Munich and was named PFA Player of the Year in 2001. He returned to Spurs after United and also represented Portsmouth and West Ham, finally hanging up his shooting boots aged 42. Teddy Sheringham's scored 355 goals during his glittering 24-year professional career . Sheringham won the Premier League three times with Manchester United and also tasted Champions League glory in 1999 . 12. Ruud van Nistelrooy (Manchester United) One of the best goal poachers the Premier League has ever seen, Dutchman Van Nistelrooy scored at an incredible rate for Man United, 150 times in all across just five seasons. His £18.5m transfer from PSV Eindhoven in 2000 was put back a year because of concerns over his knees but once in the United attack, there was no stopping him. RVN scored 23 in 32 league games in his first season, including in eight consecutive matches, then 25 in the next as United regained their title. He was the league’s Player of the Season in 2003 and later broke Denis Law’s European scoring record. He scored 21 goals in his final season at United before joining Real Madrid. Ruud van Nistelrooy's goals helped Manchester United to Premier League glory in 2003 and FA Cup success the year after . Van Nistelrooy joined United from PSV in a £19million deal and scored over 20 league goals in four of his five seasons . 11. Les Ferdinand (QPR, Newcastle United, Tottenham, West Ham, Leicester City, Bolton Wanderers) Direct and deadly in front of goal, Ferdinand racked up 149 goals in the Premier League. The first of those came with QPR and in the inaugural PL campaign, his 20 goals carrying the west London club to an unlikely fifth place finish. He backed this up with hauls of 16 and 24 in the next two campaigns, prompting title challengers Newcastle to pay £6m for his services. His 25 goals in 1995-1996 took Newcastle to within touching distance of the title, though they ultimately blew a 12-point lead to allow Manchester United to profit. Forging a successful partnership with Alan Shearer, he scored 41 league goals in all on Tyneside. After moving to Tottenham, his vital goals spared them from relegation and he later played at West Ham, Leicester and Bolton. Les Ferdinand scored a total of 149 Premier League goals during his career with six top-flight clubs .","Sergio Aguero and Luis Suarez star in our latest list of top Premier League strikers .

"Paul Scholes has rubbished the idea of Raheem Sterling needing extended periods of rest after games. Sterling sat out the majority of England's 1-0 win in Estonia on Sunday after complaining of tiredness. The mercurial winger's boss at Liverpool Brendan Rodgers has been on a collision course with England manager Roy Hodgson over his use of Sterling. Roy Hodgson elected to just use Raheem Sterling off the bench in Tallinn after he complained of tiredness . Fellow England international Jordan Henderson drove Sterling into training at Liverpool on Tuesday . But former Three Lions midfielder Scholes believes the Anfield star should be fine to play games in quick succession, pointing to his experience while training with Manchester United.

'The “two-day recovery” concept was introduced at Manchester United during my time there by the fitness coach Tony Strudwick, who also works with England. Tony knows how to look after players. Roy Hodgson let Sterling start on the bench for England's 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win in Estonia on Sunday . Sterling came on in the second-half and made an impact, winning the free-kick for Wayne Rooney's winner . 'The two-day recovery was only for the oldest among us, generally speaking the over-33s. 'The second day after a game, the likes of myself, Rio Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs would do some strides across the pitch, stretch for 20 minutes and go back in for a massage. The rest of the squad would train as normal.' Sterling is in the middle of a club vs country row involving bosses Brendan Rodgers and Roy Hodgson . Scholes, however, does not blame Hodgson for Sterling's set-back, rather pressure from Liverpool. He continued: 'That injury to Sturridge was not Hodgson’s fault. It could have happened to any player from any club. 'What has created the problem has been Rodgers complaining about the two-day recovery process in the aftermath of the injury.' Paul Scholes (centre), training here in his Manchester United days, claims rest days should be for older players . England maintained their unbeaten record in the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign with victory in Estonia thanks to captain Wayne Rooney's second-half free-kick.

"An Air Force Academy whistle blower who was recruited to work as an undercover agent and exposed a culture of rape, drug abuse and partying by cadet athletes - especially on the football team - was thanked for his service by being expelled from the academy and kicked out of the military. Investigators, including the Air Force's own Inspector General, say that Eric Thomas was instrumental in 'Operation Gridiron,' which led to 37 cadets being kicked out of the academy, including four football players and four basketball players. Two offenders, including star defensive back Jamil Cooks, were sentenced to prison time after being convicted of rape. Shunned: Eric Thomas was kicked out of the Air Force after working as an undercover informant in an investigation that led to 37 cadets being expelled . The investigation involved 16 members of the Air Force Falcons football team. Four players were eventually kicked out - two of them sentenced to jail time for committing rape. Jamil Cooks (no 46) was sentenced to five months behind bars but was suspected of half a dozen rapes, authorities say . Air Force football stars Anthony Daniels (left) and Jamil Cooks (right) were both arrested, court martialed convicted and served jail time for sexual assault . 'I was crucified, I was told how much of a terrible cadet I was,' Thomas told ABC News. Lieutenant General Michael Gould, who led the academy until recently, told ABC News that Thomas 'deserved to be disenrolled.' 'You would not want that particular individual to be an officer in our Air Force today,' he said. The landmark investigation, the biggest ever in the history of the Air Force Academy, has been hailed as a major step toward cleaning up a toxic culture in the athletic department and cracking down on sexual assault - which has become an epidemic in the US military. But Mr Thomas, and his handler Office of Special Investigations Sergeant Brandon Enos, paid the price. Thomas said that as more and more players on the Air Force's vaunted football team became the subject of investigation, he found himself the target of disciplinary hearings. The Air Force Falcons football team has brought in millions of dollars in ticket sales, TV deals and alumni donations. As investigators turned up the heat on the team, many top boosters and powerful officers began to show their displeasure with the digging. Mr Thomas admits that he had received several demerits, but says nearly all of his discipline was a result of performing duties for his undercover work. The investigation rocked the Air Force Academy to its core and angered many top generals and alumni donors . Lt. General Michael Gould was superintendent of the Air Force Academy at the time and condemned Mr Thomas' actions, saying he should never be an Air Force officer . Sgt. Brian Enos, Mr Thomas' handler, was also drummed out of the Air Force . Sgt Enos was told by his supervisors not to testify in Mr Thomas' defense and the Office of Special Investigations worked to deny that  Mr Thomas had even been a part of the investigation. Mr Thomas was recruited as an informant by Sgt Enos in April 2011. At the time he was a cadet and a third-string linebacker on the Air Force Falcons football team. He agreed at times to wear a wire and report any claims of sexual assault that he encountered. What he recorded for investigators was shocking. He went to one party where football players only let women drink out of a Captain Morgan rum bottle with a blue cap. The blue cap, the players said, meant that they had put date rape drugs in the drink. At that same party, he heard about players gang raping an unconscious woman. Cadets, including football players, also smoked synthetic marijuana and did other drugs at the party, authorities say. 'I can confidently say there would have been no convictions at the academy probably to this day without Eric,' Sgt Enos told ABC. However, Sgt Enos didn't fair much better than Mr Thomas. He says he was stripped of his badge and transferred to a job picking up garbage for the Air Force - essentially drummed out. He eventually left after claiming medical disability. New York Senator Kirsten Gillibran has called Mr Thomas' dismissal 'a case of retaliation.' She has called for a full investigation. Mr Thomas, meanwhile, is appealing the dismissal and has moved back home to South Dakota. He still dreams of flying jets for the Air Force, he says.","Eric Thomas agreed to go undercover for 'Operation Gridiron' that led to 37 cadets being kicked out on drug and rape charges .

"A police boss has been forced to apologise after telling a scandal-hit chief constable the name of woman who accused him of sexism. Nick Gargan, 47, head of Avon and Somerset Police, was suspended in May after allegations emerged that he had made inappropriate compliments about the appearance of 35 women. The Independent Complaints Commission launched an investigation, which concluded no criminal charges would be brought. Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens (left) has been forced to apologise after she disclosed the name of a complainant to Chief Constable Nick Gargan (right) But the enquiry was brought into disrepute after it emerged Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens told Mr Gargan the name of one woman who had made a complaint. She said: 'In May 2014, I was made aware by a member of my team that someone had approached them and made a verbal complaint against Chief Constable Nick Gargan. 'During a subsequent conversation with Mr Gargan I was discussing a concern I had around how that individual was coping generally, and I mentioned that a complaint had been made against him by that person. 'At the time of the conversation I was not aware of the full facts which became apparent subsequently - including the detail of the allegations being made and the request for whistle-blower status.' Ms Mountstevens, who is an Independent Party member, said as soon as she became aware of the seriousness of the allegations she voluntarily referred the details of the conversation to the watchdog. She added: 'A complaint about the disclosure of the name was subsequently made to the Police and Crime Panel, who looked into the matter and found that I had made a mistake. Head of Avon and Somerset Police, Nick Gargan, 47, was suspended in May after allegations of sexual harassment emerged - they included making inappropriate compliments about the appearance of 35 women . 'I agreed with their finding and I have already written to the individual concerned to apologise for the distress I caused. 'I firmly believe that everyone in public office needs to be held to the same high standard of conduct, which is why I told the IPCC of my conversation before their investigation began. 'I have co-operated fully with the Police and Crime Panel's investigation process. 'This was a new situation for me and, while I could have handled it better, I have learnt from it and employees within the constabulary can feel confident approaching me or my team if they have issues they feel uncomfortable raising elsewhere. 'There are a number of ways staff and officers can raise issues confidentially which include speaking to their line manager, reporting it to the Professional Standards department or by using an anonymous phone line or email system.' Mr Gargan was suspended on full pay, around £150,000 a year, just 13 months after being appointed by Ms Mountstevens. It is claimed he sent a text to one young officer saying: 'You are doing a great job - do you fancy a drink tonight?' Complaints were made by two female members of staff and over 50 officers and staff from the constabulary were interviewed during the investigation. The British embassy in Paris: According to sources, his close relationship with a senior embassy colleague's daughter was hushed up, and after returning home Mr Gargan, now 47, continued his rise through the ranks . The IPCC has now finished its probe and sent a report to Ms Mountstevens who will decide next month if there is a case to answer for either misconduct or gross misconduct. Mr Gargan denies any wrongdoing. During the investigation it also emerged that Mr Gargan had left a previous post at the British embassy in Paris after he developed a close relationship with a senior colleague’s daughter. It is thought the affinity developed while he was working in France on the investigation into the death of Princess Diana. Ms Mountstevens said that she was unaware of Mr Gargan’s unhappy spell in Paris when she appointed him chief constable last year. Until a month ago he was being tipped as a potential future Scotland Yard commissioner.","Nick Gargan, 47, was suspended after allegations of sexual harassment .

"It will cost the federal government – taxpayers, that is – $50,000 for every person who gets health insurance under the Obamacare law, the Congressional Budget Office revealed on Monday. The number comes from figures buried in a 15-page section of the nonpartisan organization's new ten-year budget outlook. The best-case scenario described by the CBO would result in 'between 24 million and 27 million' fewer Americans being uninsured in 2025, compared to the year before the Affordable Care Act took effect. Pulling that off will cost Uncle Sam about $1.35 trillion – or $50,000 per head. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE REPORT . THE $2 TRILLION DOLLAR MAN: President Barack Obama was in India on Monday when the Congressional Budget Office reported the federal government's gross costs for a decade of Obamacare will be $1.993 trillion . PROMISES: Obama pledged in 2009 during a speech before a joint session of Congress that his health insurance proposal would cost $900 billion over ten years – a far cry short of current numbers . The numbers are daunting: It will take $1.993 trillion, a number that looks like $1,993,000,000,000, to provide insurance subsidies to poor and middle-class Americans, and to pay for a massive expansion of Medicaid and CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) costs. Offsetting that massive outlay will be $643 billion in new taxes, penalties and fees related to the Obamacare law. That revenue includes quickly escalating penalties – or 'taxes,' as the U.S. Supreme Court described them – on people who resist Washington's command to buy medical insurance. It also includes income from a controversial medical device tax, which some Republicans predict will be eliminated in the next two years. If they're right, Obamacare's per-person cost would be even higher. President Barack Obama pledged to members of Congress in 2009, as his signature insurance overhaul law was being hotly debated, that 'the plan I'm proposing will cost around $900 billion over 10 years.' It would be a significant discount if the White House could return to that number today. PRICEY: The federal government will spend $50,000 for each person recruited to buy insurance or neroll in free Medicaid through the Obamacare exchanges . In that same speech, Obama claimed that there were 'more than 30 million American citizens who cannot get coverage.' $900 billion spent on those people would equate to no more than $30,000 each – less than two-thirds of what the CBO now says the program will cost when the dust settles. The CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation, a group of members from both houses of Congress, prepared Monday's report on the overall direction of the federal budget. They estimated that 'the net costs of the coverage provisions of the ACA [Affordable Care Act] will rise sharply as the effects of the act phase in from 2015 through 2017.' Those costs will 'rise steadily through 2022' before leveling off for three years, the groups' economists determined. But even at that point, the Obamacare program will cost the governemnt 'about $145 billion' each year. That number doesn't include the insurance premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs paid by Americans – only the government's role in implementing the law and paying for its guarantees. And the law will still leave 'between 29 million and 31 million' nonelderly Americans without medical insurance, says the CBO. CBO January 2015 Outlook on Obamacare uploaded by DailyMail.com .","Stunning figure comes from Congressional Budget Office report that revised cost estimates for the next 10 years .

"Paul Scholes has empathised with Steven Gerrard following his announcement to leave Liverpool at the end of the season. Despite a long list of honours with the Reds - including an heroic Champions League victory against AC Milan in Istanbul in 2005 - Gerrard has his critics for having never lifted a Premier League trophy with his boyhood club. Speaking with The Independent on Saturday, former Manchester United midfielder Scholes revealed his thoughts on the Liverpool captain leaving behind a 17-year professional career at Anfield without winning a domestic league title. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard announced that he will leave the club at the end of the season . Gerrard kisses the 2005 Champions League trophy alongside Jamie Carragher but will leave the club . 'It's difficult for me, as a United fan, to say it's a pity that Gerrard has never won the league. It is easier to say he deserves to have a league winners' medal,' Scholes said. The 40-year-old also aired his views about Gerrard's admirable loyalty to the club hindering his chances of league success. 'If there was a time to leave Liverpool and join another club, he should have gone to Chelsea when they tried to sign him for the second time after he won the Champions League in 2005.

Considering Chelsea's two successful campaigns in England's top flight since that memorable night in Istanbul - in 2005-06 and 2009-10 - Scholes was pragmatic in his approach. 'There are those who say it would have been worth less with Chelsea. I disagree. 'Moving clubs is part of football. I was lucky that my club were strong enough that I could fulfil my ambitions there. 'I wonder if part of his decision to leave Liverpool now was that, compared with last season, the club look much further away from the league title.'","Steven Gerrard announced his decision to leave Anfield late on January 1 .

"Wayne Rooney arrived at Manchester United as a better all-round player than Cristiano Ronaldo despite signing a year after the Portuguese star, according to Rio Ferdinand. The former Everton striker signed in a £27million deal in 2004, with a huge reputation and the potential to become one of the game's next global stars. Ferdinand claims there was so much excitement when Rooney joined, although Ronaldo has since gone on to dwarf the former's achievements with United and most recently Real Madrid. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney making his England youth and senior debuts . Wayne Rooney signed for Manchester United in a £25million deal from Everton in 2004 . The striker arrived a year after future star Cristiano Ronaldo, but Rio Ferdinand says he was a better player . Ferdinand went on to play with the formidable duo during a hugely successful period for United . Speaking in an exclusive with The Sun, Ferdinand says: 'It's hard to explain just how much excitement there was at Old Trafford when he [Rooney] joined us. He signed a year after Cristiano Ronaldo but Rooney was the better all-round player. 'He was a more mature footballer who could bring the rest of the team into the game and could score and make goals. 'Cristiano was special, too, and his tricks, flicks and dribbles were fantastic. But at the time he did not have the rounded game which Wazza had.' Rooney and Ronaldo built up a fine partnership on the pitch, but famously clashed at the World Cup in 2006 when the English star was sent off in a quarter-final against Portugal. Ronaldo was spotted winking at his bench after protesting with the referee, ramping up claims that he helped get the youngster sent off.

'He said to me, ""Can I talk to Wazza, is he OK?"", Ferdinand adds. 'He asked me to go and get him and kept saying, ""I didn't try to get him sent off, I really didn't.""

"Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli insists there will be no more fireworks off the pitch - and says that anyone who thinks he has sex just before a match is having a laugh. The Italy striker is more famous for his off-field antics than his exploits on the pitch, and the most notorious incident was when fireworks were let off in his bathroom. Balotelli said: 'I have done mistakes in the past, like everybody did when they were young. Mario Balotelli prepares to fly out to Basle with Liverpool - and a fan sporting the same haircut stands behind . Balotelli with former girlfriend Fanny Neguesha in Miami Beach earlier this year . Mario Balotelli admits he needs to improve his goalscoring record of one goal in eight Liverpool appearances . Balotelli was speaking in an exclusive interview with Sport Magazine . 'And the firework thing did happen, but it wasn't me who let it off. I know England is like this, though, so it's OK. It's a shame, sure, but I get used to it – the newspapers are always trying to give an image of Mario that is bad, printing things that aren't true. 'Off the pitch, really I don't have any problems because I am always home. When people speak bad about me, it's only because they listen to the media and read what the newspapers say. They maybe lose a little bit of focus on my football, so everybody thinks I am famous for what happens outside the pitch.' The 24-year-old also said rumours of him having sex just before a match were unfounded - and that he is only interested in scoring on the pitch. He told Sport magazine: 'Someone told me recently that I had apparently said that if I have sex three or four hours before a game, it is working for me on the pitch. Trust me, if I am having sex four hours before a game I am not able to play. I don't think anyone could. It makes me laugh, but this is not me. 'I am only focused on football. I live out in the countryside, I am relaxed and I just hope the time that I'm going to score is coming soon. Then maybe they will concentrate more on football and not all the other bull****.' To that end, Balotelli believes Brendan Rodgers's strength of character can help him make a success of his Liverpool career. The Italy international said he was surprised by the quality in Liverpool's squad when he signed and has admitted that he is desperate to score his first Premier League goal for the club. The striker has had the international break to focus solely on his club form after being dropped by the new Italy head coach, Antonio Conte, and says he is determined to repay the faith shown to him by the Liverpool supporters. Balotelli (second left) scored Liverpool's opener in their 2-1 Champions League win against Ludogorets . Daniel Sturridge (right) is expected to feature alongside Balotelli against QPR after returning from a thigh injury . Asked about playing under Rodgers, Balotelli said: 'He is very good, a strong character, and I think that comes out in the way the team plays. 'I think he can help me improve as a player. He is very open, everybody can talk to him, but first he looks at the person, and second he looks at the footballer. With Brendan, you need to be a good person – you don't have to be, how do you say it, a d***head. 'I need to get in the box more. I don't do it enough, but it is something I am working to try to do more. I have never been a real, out-and-out striker – I have always been someone who goes around the pitch, you know? 'If it was my choice, I would always go with two strikers. It's the way I like to play, but Brendan asked me to play as the first striker. I understand that when the ball comes from wide on the left or right, I need to be in the box otherwise there might be no-one there at all. 'I can see already that the Liverpool fans really like me, although I know that maybe they are a little upset because I don't score. I see they appreciate that I am working hard, though, which is nice for me.' Balotelli added: 'I didn't really know much about the club before coming here, but I've been really surprised. 'I knew they were a very good team, but I didn't know they were as good as they are. Of course we need to improve many things because we have started off not very good, but I think the players here are amazing.' Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (left) has been compared to Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo by Balotelli . Balotelli said his current objective is to break his Premier League duck. 'I can see already that the Liverpool fans really like me, although I know that maybe they are a little upset because I don't score. 'I see they appreciate that I am working hard, though, which is nice for me. I know I have one goal in the Champions League, but in the Premier League I have to start with one. After that, I might set myself a target, but I swear – right now my first league goal is my first and only objective. 'I need to get in the box more. I don't do it enough, but it is something I am working to try to do more. I have never been a real, out-and-out striker – I have always been someone who goes around the pitch, you know? 'If it was my choice, I would always go with two strikers. It's the way I like to play, but Brendan asked me to play as the first striker. I understand that when the ball comes from wide on the left or right, I need to be in the box otherwise there might be no one there at all.' Balotelli also compared Steven Gerrard to his fellow Italian Andrea Pirlo: 'Gerrard is an amazing player. I had really not seen much of him before this season, apart from for England, but wow. I think of him as being at the same level as Pirlo. Balotelli posted an Instagram picture of himself in a shark hoodie on Wednesday . 'Vision, technique, but he is powerful as well. Stevie can do anything. It's going to be very difficult for the team to find another player like him in the future.' Balotelli is settling on Merseyside but misses his pet dogs who are back home in Italy; a labrador-pitbull cross Lucky, who lives in with the star's foster parents and his other dog, a rottweiler called Tyson, he said: 'If I say kiss, then she kisses me. 'Of course I miss my family and friends in Italy. But when I go back, I spend hours talking with my parents. Then I visit my friends and we do normal stuff – you know, playing PlayStation and ping pong. Then I pick up my dogs and we go for a walk. 'They are really clever, my dogs.

"Michael Phelps' self-proclaimed girlfriend Taylor Lianne Chandler has just made a shocking admission. In a post on her Facebook, Chandler is revealing she was actually born a boy, and named David Roy Fitch at birth. As a teenager however Chandler went on testosterone blockers and had her name changed and then, in her early twenties, underwent corrective surgery to get rid of her male genitalia. Scroll down for videos . Shocker: Michael Phelps' self-proclaimed girlfriend Taylor Lianne Chandler (above) has admitted she was born David Roy Fitch, and had both male and female genitalia . In the dark: Chandler said her new man Phelps (above) was not aware of her past, though there's no actual proof that the two were ever an official item . Her choice: Chandler began taking testosterone blockers in her teens, and had corrective surgery in her early twenties to get rid of her male genitalia . Feet in the sand: Chandler has since been a champion for gender rights . Chandler was born a male however in name only, and is actually intersex, meaning she had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries. As she explains in a Facebook post, 'I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.' She then adds, 'There are people that remember me as an androgynous child at times because of what was forced upon me.' She is also revealing how in love she is with Phelps, and claims the two clicked after meeting on Tinder. 'Spending time with him was like a teenage love affair,' she says. 'I have never felt so comfortable and accepted in every way as I did with him.' In costume: Chandler dressed as Wonder Woman for Halloween with a pal .

'Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.' She also told the magazine that she never lied to the swimmer about her past, saying it just never came up. Famous friends: Chandler cozies up to RuPaul's Drag Race alum Detox . So sweet: Chandler posted this image of Phelps to her account and wrote about how excited she was to see him again . Now however, Chandler thinks Phelps may 'leave her' after telling her truth. 'I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn’t put him or our relationship in the best light,' she says. Her Facebook is a shrine to the swimmer, with his photos plastered all over her wall and banner. She also seems to repost any and all stories that mention their relationship. He's out: Chandler said on her Facebook on Wednesday that Phelps is out of rehab . Still on?: Phelps has yet to comment on any of this . Chandler claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore, Maryland.

The alleged couple also have a bit of an age gap between them, and Phelps is 29 and Chandler is 41-years-old. Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time with 22 medals, is currently serving a six month suspension from swimming as a result of his DUI.

In her post, Chandler also takes some time to discuss the difficulties she has faced in her life. 'In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery,' she explains. 'I originally changed my name to Paige Victoria Whitney. At 16 I legally emancipated from my family. I had already left home at 15. At 18 I got in trouble twice, once for a bad check and then a DUI.' 'At 19 I thought it would be smart to blackmail someone into giving me the money for my surgery. As soon as I received the money I was arrested and charged with extortion.' 'I spent 30 days in jail because I was too ashamed to tell my family what happened thinking no one knew. Even though my birth certificate and drivers license said female they put me in a cell with 3 men and I was raped.' She has since spent much of her life crusading for gender rights.","Michael Phelps' self-proclaimed girlfriend Taylor Lianne Chandler has revealed she was born David Roy Fitch .

"Manchester City have been allowed to name only one club-trained player in their squad for the opening stages of this season's Champions League - three less than Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool. City, despite having failed UEFA's FFP ruling which meant their squad had to be reduced from 25 to 21 for the tournament, have been allowed to reduce their non-overseas quota to five to compensate for the reduction, according to The Independent. Clubs in the Champions League are meant to have at least four 'club-trained' and four 'association-trained' players in their 25-man squads, but UEFA have seemingly accommodated City's situation. Manuel Pellegrini has been handed a boost ahead of Manchester City's return to the Champions League next week after UEFA allowed their squad's non-overseas quota to be reduced from 25 to 21 for the tournament . Champions League football returns to the Etihad Stadium when City host Roma on September 30. They open their group stage campaign against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday . Of City's five non-overseas quota, Dedryck Boyata is the only club-trained player, with Joe Hart, James Milner, Gael Clichy and Frank Lampard making up the rest as association-trained players. Boyata, a Belgian-born midfielder signed as a teenager from Brussels, has made just 11 Premier League appearances for City since joining in 2009. He was given a new contract in May to keep him at the club until 2016. Daniel Geey, a football law specialist, told the Independent: 'UEFA have effectively rewritten their home-grown player rule. There is nothing in Uefa or FFP regulations about the home-grown rule changing.' Dedryck Boyata, who has made just 11 Premier League appearances for City since joining in 2009, qualifies as the club-trained player in the Champions League squad for this season . James Milner, seen here scoring for City in their win over Bayern last season, counts as an association-trained player under the Financial Fair Player regulations . It is thought that players union Fifpro - with full support of City - started making overtures to Uefa that they would potentially take legal action over theoretical restriction of trade. Uefa eventually relaxed the restriction and allowed City to have five non-overseas players, meaning 16 foreign players rather than the predicted 13. The likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea may argue that Uefa have let City off the hook. If Champions League squad was going to be shrunk from 25 to 21, this would assume proportionally that eight home-grown players should become seven, not five. City believe they have fully complied with Uefa's rules with regards to the composition of their Champions League squad.","Manchester City have been allowed only one club-trained player in their Champions League squad for the coming season .

"Alert: Gregory Lewis fled his $1,000 bail in September and is suspected of at least six more violent sexual assaults across the country since . The nationwide manhunt for a child rape suspect has come to a dramatic end after he was arrested in Upstate New York Tuesday night after crashing his Jeep into the Hudson River following a police chase. Gregory Lewis, 26, spent more than a month on the run after cutting off his GPS minoring bracelet in Massachusetts and fleeing across the country. Now, police reveal, he vowed to murder the 13-year-old girl who first accused him of sexually assaulting her. Lewis was arrested Tuesday night in Fort Edward, New York, after crashing his Jeep into the Hudson River during a brief chase. Police say he kidnapped, raped and robbed at least six women in North Carolina, Colorado, and Oregon during his crime spree that began on September 15. However, at the time of his arrest, he was 165 miles from Southbridge, Massachusetts, the hometown where his alleged teenage victim lives. Police said on Wednesday that during his crime spree, he told people he encountered that he planned to kill the 13-year-old victim. Lewis arrested after a New York State Police trooper spotted his blue Jeep with no license plates about 9.30pm outside Fort Edward. He fled, then crashed it into the Hudson River. 'He actually drove to the end of a dead-end street and didn’t realize it was a dead end and drove down an embankment and into the water,' Fort Edward Police Chief Justin Durway told WBZ-AM. As he fled his sinking car on foot. When a witness came over to help him, Lewis threatened the man with a gun. After a 20-minute search, a police dog found Lewis. Immediately after seeing police, he dropped his gun and raised his hands. 'Don't you know who I am?' to bragged to cops. Officers recovered the pistol, which he had stolen from his step-father during a violent robbery in Massachusetts. Lewis is now being held in the Washington County jail, awaiting extradition to Massachusetts. The crime spree began on September 15 when he cut off his court-ordered GPS ankle bracelet while free on bail in Southbridge, Massachusetts. He was awaiting trail on charges that he groomed then raped a 13-year-old girl. Scroll down for video . Rescue workers are seen at the edge of the Hudson River where Lewis crashed into the water and was later arrested . This is the spot on the Hudson River where Lewis crashed his car while evading police. He allegedly threatened to shoot a witness who offered help . Spotted: Lewis is believed to have been spotted in Denver (left earlier in October and was last seen in Columbus, Ohio, over the weekend (right) The monitoring device was found in the girl's front yard. A nationwide alert had been sent to all law enforcement authorities to apprehend Lewis who is accused of luring multiple escorts to seedy motel rooms and beating and raping them. 'The victims have been handcuffed, threatened with a gun, robbed, and sexually assaulted,' says a report issued to all state police in an update. Lewis was driving a blue 2004 Jeep Gran Cherokee that he stole from his stepfather on September 25 after returning home for an evening and beating and handcuffing him. He left home armed with cash, a 9mm handgun and more than 200 rounds of ammunition. Lewis was first arrested on August 5 and charged with raping the 13-year-old girl. He was released on $1,000 bail, a decision which left many dumbfounded. 'Certainly this gentleman should have never been released on bail,' said Southbridge Town Councilor Clemence to the Boston Herald. 'I hope that the judicial system will fix some of those mistakes because it’s wreaked havoc across the country.' The circumstances that allowed a suspected child rapist to flee on an alleged cross country raping spree began when Judge Michael Allard-Madaus set bail for Lewis at only $1,000 - but on the condition he wore a GPS ankle bracelet and stay away from anyone under 16. Police dog Nass, a black Labrador, tracked down Lewis and allowed officers to catch up with him and apprehend him . Search: Lewis was driving stepfather's Jeep Cherokee, which was stolen on September 25 from his home along with cash and a handgun . Rampage over: Lewis' time on the lam ended Tuesday night 160 miles from where it began in Southbridge Massachusetts. Fort Edward, where he was captured, is about 200 miles north of New York City . While out on bail on September 15, he drove to the girl's house, in breach of his bail, removed his GPS tag and left it on her lawn and vanished. One week later, on September 23, ABC affiliate WSOC in Charlotte has reported that Lewis attacked a 29-year-old woman at a motel on Yorkmont Road. The woman who didn't want to use her name said Lewis told her she he lived in Charlotte. 'I met him on Plenty of Fish, a dating website,' the woman told WSOC by phone. It was just after arriving at the motel that Lewis began to attack the woman. 'He put me in a choke hold and put handcuffs on me with my hands behind my back and said I'm not going to hurt you I just want your money,' she said. to WSOC. The woman managed to engineer her escape after telling Lewis that most of her money was in her car. Trail of terror: A nationwide alert had been sent to all law enforcement authorities to apprehend Lewis . Police put out detailed identifying information in an attempt to find him, including a tattoo of a demonic female figure on his right upper arm and a tattoo of a hand holding a knife with a broken handcuff on his chest. When they reached the parking lot, she fled. Police have released several surveillance photos of Lewis from recent days, but have admitted he may have shaved his facial hair. Two days after the North Carolina assault was when Lewis returned home to rob his stepfather. He then traveled in his Jeep Cherokee to Denver in early October and is suspected of committing robberies and rapes there. He then moved onto Portland, Oregon on or around October 13 and then moved onto Boise, Idaho and then in turn to Salt Lake City, Utah. He is then thought to have made his way back through Denver and was last spotted in Columbus, Ohio over the weekend. 'We have reason to believe that Lewis is heading east again. We know that he was in the Columbus, Ohio, area Sunday evening and we know he was further west prior to that,' said state police spokesman David Procopio to the Boston Herald.","Gregory Lewis, 26, was arrested Tuesday in Fort Edward, New York, following a police chase that caused him to crash his Jeep into the river .

"A Left-wing cookery writer has sparked outrage by saying David Cameron should resign for using his ‘dead son’ as a front to privatise the NHS. Jack Monroe, who writes for The Guardian on cookery and poverty issues, said on Twitter that the Prime Minister should go because he ‘uses stories about his dead son as misty-eyed rhetoric to legitimise selling our NHS to his friends’. Mr Cameron’s son Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, died aged six in 2009. A father’s love: David Cameron with his son Ivan, who had cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Ivan died in 2009 . Offensive: Left-wing cookery writer Jack Monroe’s tweet attacking David Cameron . Last night, Tory backbenchers lined up to express their disgust at the ‘distasteful’ and ‘sick’ comments, and the idea that the Prime Minister would use his son for such a purpose. Mr Cameron has previously spoken about his admiration for the NHS and how it helped care for his son. At the last Tory conference, he questioned how Labour could ‘dare’ to claim he does not care about the Health Service when it had been so important for his family. Miss Monroe made her comments on the social networking website, where users were coming up with their own suggestions of why ‘#CameronMustGo’.

Her suggestion was: ‘Because he uses stories about his dead son as misty-eyed rhetoric to legitimise selling our NHS to his friends’. The grammar-school educated Miss Monroe writes a blog called A Girl Called Jack. She started publishing recipes online aimed at people with low incomes, and last year began contributing recipes and columns to The Guardian. Miss Monroe also appeared in a Labour Party broadcast as a member of the public. Mr Cameron has been accused by the Left of promoting the privatisation of the Health Service as part of wholesale reforms which came into effect two years ago. Reaction: Andrew Rosindell (left), Tory MP for Romford, said the comments were 'deeply shocking', while Philip Davies (right), Tory MP for Shipley, said it shows 'how deeply unpleasant people on the Left are' Ultimatum: Sarah Wollaston (pictured), Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, said the blogger should 'immediately apologise… or The Guardian should decide if she should go' Jack Monroe, 26, is a mother-of-one and food writer from Southend-on-Sea in Essex. She attended Westcliff High School For Girls but left aged 16 and worked odd jobs before becoming a control room employee for Essex County Fire and Rescue Service in 2007. Jack Monroe (r) with girlfriend Allegra McEvedy (l) Five years later, having left that job too after becoming unable to balance night shifts with looking after a young son as a single mother, she started a blog called A Girl Called Jack. The blog on budget food and recipes became a huge success and Miss Monroe now writes a weekly Guardian column - also contributing to other newspapers and broadcasters. She had planned to marry a long-term police officer girlfriend earlier this year, but their relationship ended last October. Now, Miss Monroe lives in west London with her new partner, mother-of-one Allegra McEvedy, a chef who was 44 yesterday. But critics pointed out that it was under Labour that private companies were invited in to run NHS services. Tory backbenchers expressed outrage at Miss Monroe’s comments. Nadine Dorries said: 'I respect Ms Monroe for many of her principles, but this is shocking. She is a parent, she only needs to imagine the unimaginable to know how hurtful and wrong that comment must be.' Charlotte Leslie added: 'Anyone of any integrity is left pretty speechless. Not only is this incredibly callous and hurtful from someone who is supposed to be in a position of some responsibility, it is also utterly inaccurate. 'It just goes to show what depths anyone must stoop to in order to find a criticism of a PM who has overseen a massive turnaround of this country from a Lefty Government that, in true Labour style, left us bankrupt.' Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘This is not just a distasteful tweet, it is sick. ‘If a Right-Wing politician or columnist had made such a comment, Miss Monroe would be writing hand-wringing columns about how evil or cruel such a comment was. 'If The Guardian had any moral compass it would sack Miss Monroe and publish a front-page apology to the Prime Minister and his wife for the distress this comment has made.’ Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, said: ‘This is thoroughly unpleasant and distasteful. David and Samantha’s tragic loss of their son has never been used to justify any Government policy. ‘These comments are deeply shocking and will cause enormous hurt. They should be withdrawn immediately.’ Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘Left-wingers like this are always the first to take offence in what others say, but think it is fine to make the vilest comments themselves. ‘This just goes to show how deeply unpleasant people on the Left are – something many of us see day in day out, but others tend not to see. They preach compassion one minute but are more lacking in compassion than anyone.’ Sarah Wollaston, Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘What would The Guardian say about an MP who made such a disgusting and heartless comment? 'Would they call for them to be sacked? She should immediately apologise… or The Guardian should decide if she should go.’","Jack Monroe writes for The Guardian on cookery and poverty issues .

"She denies she was close to the Communist rulers in East Germany, where she grew up. So this 1972 photo of her in military-style uniform has left German Chancellor Angela Merkel ‘not amused’. Then called Angela Kasner and aged 17, she is shown happily involved in a civil defence exercise under the gaze of an East German officer. Drills included first aid and preparing for nuclear attack.

A member of Italy's metalworkers union walks by a banner with a picture of German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a demonstration in Rome. The unrest came as Mrs Merkel tried to dampen speculation over her links with East German communists . All children had to take part if . they wanted to go to university, but Mrs Merkel is also alleged to have . been a propaganda secretary for the youth movement, the FDJ. The photo was found by an old schoolfriend, Sonja Felssberg, 58, and handed to a German newspaper.

Sonja Felssberg, now 58 and an old school comrade, found the photo and handed it to a national German newspaper. Mrs Merkel will hope the row doesn't undermine her bid for a third term in office . It was published as Mrs Merkel, who was the subject of austerity protests in Italy at the weekend, tried to play down allegations in a new book that she was much closer to the Communist rulers of the lost Socialist state than she previously admitted to, including holding a post as a propaganda secretary in the youth movement the FDJ. Mrs. Felssberg said: 'We all had to sleep ten to a room in bunk beds when we did the exercises. In the day we learned things like treating wounds and stabilising patients - not much different from what you would learn today in first aid training with the Red Cross. 'But we also had to march and learn to use maps and a compass for hikes in the woods and wilderness. It was long ago but I remember it very well - and Angela.'

"Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero may have an outstanding goal tally so far this season, but Barcelona boss Luis Enrique had no hesitations when asked who he feels is the best player in the world. Following the Catalan giants' draw against City in the last 16 of the Champions League, Enrique was asked his thoughts on their free-scoring front man. 'He's probably up there in the top ten or so players,' he said. Barcelona manager Luis Enrique expressed his opinion on Lionel Messi (left) and Sergio Aguero (right) 'But for me the number one is Leo Messi. Everyone else comes after him.' Having netted an impressive 19 goals in 20 games before suffering an injury against Everton, Aguero is not far behind his compatriot, who has 21 goals in 21 games for Barcelona. It's not the first time City will face Barcelona in the last 16 of Europe's most prestigious tournament, the Spanish side having eliminated Manuel Pellegrini's team at the same stage last season, winning 4-1 on aggregate. That said, Enrique will not be getting carried away with past results. Manchester City will be missing out on Aguero's talents whilst he is sidelined with a knee injury . Manchester City have been drawn against Barcelona in the Champions League for the second straight season . 'In principle (Manchester City) one of the hardest (teams) we could have faced,' he added. 'I am sure it will be a very hard match,' he added. 'The important thing in games like these is for us to be in good condition. 'If we're on form, we are good enough to cope with any competition. I always think positively, and I know we are quite capable of getting through the round against Manchester City.'","Barcelona boss Luis Enrique said he prefers Lionel Messi to Sergio Aguero .

"Mario Balotelli has been hungry for goals at Liverpool since joining in a £16million deal from Milan in the summer but the Reds striker has portrayed his predatory instincts in an altogether different manner. The 24-year-old uploaded an Instagram picture of himself on Wednesday dressed in what appears to resemble a shark. Along with the caption, '@pumarunnining #puma we are forever faster and different??' the enigmatic forward has his face covered by a shark hoodie and with two hangers representing his hands. Mario Balotelli posted an Instagram picture of himself in a shark hoodie on Wednesday . While his style can be questioned, the Italy forward has already proven popular on Merseyside with Liverpool fans already singing a chant in his honour despite his lack of goals. Balotelli has only scored once in eight matches for the Reds this season - netting their opener in a 2-1 victory against Bulgarian side Ludogorets in the Champions League last month. This poor statistic is one Balotelli is all too aware of that needs improving - especially in the Premier League where he has failed to break his duck in five games for the club. Balotelli admits he needs to improve his goalscoring record of one goal in eight Liverpool appearances so far . Balotelli (second left) scored Liverpool's opener in their 2-1 Champions League win against Ludogorets . Mario Balotelli was speaking in an exclusive interview with Sport Magazine . 'I can see already that the Liverpool fans really like me, although I know that maybe they are a little upset because I don't score. I see they appreciate that I am working hard, though, which is nice for me,' he said in an exclusive interview with Sport magazine. 'I know I have one goal in the Champions League, but in the Premier League I have to start with one. After that, I might set myself a target, but I swear – right now my first league goal is my first and only objective. 'I need to get in the box more. I don't do it enough, but it is something I am working to try to do more. I have never been a real, out-and-out striker – I have always been someone who goes around the pitch, you know? The forward has been used largely as a lone striker by Reds boss Brendan Rodgers in the absence of Daniel Sturridge - who is expected to return from a thigh injury to face QPR on Sunday. Sturridge's inclusion in the Liverpool squad is a boost to Balotelli, who revealed his preference is to play alongside another striker in the first-team. 'If it was my choice, I would always go with two strikers,' he added. 'It's the way I like to play, but Brendan asked me to play as the first striker. I understand that when the ball comes from wide on the left or right, I need to be in the box otherwise there might be no-one there at all.' Daniel Sturridge (right) is expected to feature against QPR after returning from a thigh injury . Balotelli's stuttering start has matched that of his new club, who have won three of their first seven league games. However, the striker is confident things will improve and believes a strong English core can only help on the domestic front. 'I didn't really know much about the club before coming here, but I've been really surprised,' said the Italian, who spent two-and-a-half years at Manchester City before returning to his homeland. 'I knew they were a very good team but I didn't know they were as good as they are. Raheem Sterling (right) is one of many English talents to have impressed Balotelli at Liverpool . 'Of course we need to improve many things because we have started off not very good but I think the players here are amazing. 'It's good to see young English players here too: (Raheem) Sterling, (Jordan) Henderson, (Adam) Lallana. I think the more players you have like this, the better. 'Maybe over time you have got used to not seeing so many good, young English players like that but now we are seeing some - it's good that they are in my team.' Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (left) has been compared to Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo by Balotelli . The best English player in the striker's eyes remains Steven Gerrard, whom he compared to his veteran Italy team-mate Andrea Pirlo. 'Gerrard is an amazing player. I had really not seen much of him before this season, apart from for England, but wow!' Balotelli said. 'I think of him as being at the same level as Pirlo. Vision, technique, but he is powerful as well. Stevie can do anything. 'It's going to be very difficult for the team to find another player like him in the future.'","Liverpool face QPR at Loftus Road on Sunday at 1.30pm .

"A New Orleans woman has spoken out after being drugged at a celebrity hot spot and waking up the following day to learn she had not only gone home with one man, she had also had sex with two others. Maria Treme's ordeal happened on June 30 after she went to The Country Club, a Bywater hot spot where A-listers Beyonce, Jay Z and Solange, partied less than a month later. Ms Tremem 30, had gone to the venue to drink with a girlfriend, and had sunbathed naked, which the club allows. But after five hours beside the pool and $36 worth of drinks she blacked out. Maria Treme, 30, said she woke up with bruised thighs and immediately knew she had been 'roofied' The next day, she told WWL-TV, she woke up with bruises on her inner thighs and a lubricant beside her bed which she had never seen before. Her car keys were also gone. She said: 'I didn't know where they came from and I immediately knew I was roofied because I know how much I had to drink, I know how much I can drink and there was zero memory, nothing.' Accompanied by a friend, she went back to the club where she watched security footage to help her piece together what had happened the night before. What she saw and heard from eyewitnesses shocked her. As well as signing a much larger bar tab and shouting at a bar tender, she learned that she had had sex with one man in the pool, another in the sauna, and had gone home with a third man dressed only in a towel. Ms Treme isn't claiming all the the men raped her, and only wants to find the person who drugged her. She said: 'I'm kind-of of the opinion that if there's three innocent people and one that's not, I'm not gonna take down the three innocent people because this one person wants to be a sicko, you know?' Scene: The incident took place at The Country Club, a Bywater hot spot which allows nude sunbathing . Beyonce and Jay Z, seen here with Jack Gyllenhaal at the premiere of his new movie this week, went to the Country Club on July 21, along with Beyonce's sister Solange . According to authorities, drug rape is common in New Orleans, which has a culture of heavy drinking. Leah Foster, director of Trauma Recovery Services at New Orleans Family Justice Center, said the crime wasn't necessarily on the rise, but was receiving far more publicity. One high profile case involves former Saints star Darren Sharper who is accused of drugging and raping women in New Orleans and in four other states. But unlike in the Sharper case, where he is accused of using drugs that incapacitated the woman involved, Ms Treme is believed to have been drugged with a substance that simply makes its victims forget what they've done. All traces of it, also disappear from the body within 12 hours. Ms Treme said: 'That's where it gets tricky because, I mean, I saw myself on video walking out of there, laughing and waving to the bartender, stumbling out of there, and, you know, this guy's drunk, I appear to be drunk and I just don't think it would be right for me to say everybody raped me.' Ms Treme is also angry at the way the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) handled her case. By the time they took her to hospital for testing, it was too late for doctors to find traces of the drug used in her system. Former Saints star Darren Sharper is accused of drugging and raping women in New Orleans and in four other states; he is accused of using drugs that incapacitated the women involved before having sex with them . Ms Foster said 'the number one thing' anyone suspected of being raped should do, is get to the hospital immediately. The NOPD defended its decision to gather more evidence before taking Ms Treme to the hospital. A police spokesman said that's standard procedure for such an investigation and said the department wants to keep working with Ms Treme. Ginesse Barrett, a forensic nurse at Interim LSU Hospital's SAFE unit, says sex predators often use GHB, or LIquid X, which can be made at home and only stays in a victim's system for 12 hours. The drug is known to lower peoples inhibitions. Another factor in the case is that New Orleans police also has a bad reputation for solving sex crimes. Reported rape cares there are far below any other U.S. city with a major crime problem. And a survey of 90 sex crimes in the area last year found nearly half of them had been mischaracterized as lesser offenses. Ms Treme said she has received a lot of support from women friends who say they had experienced similar things, but she is also getting criticized for not pursuing charges against all of the men she had sex with. Sarah Ney, The Country Club's vice president and attorney, told WWL-TV that the club has very strict rules against sex on the premises and works hard to protect its clients.

"Manchester City face the potentially daunting task of needing to topple the mighty Barcelona in a bid to reach their first ever Champions League quarter-final. The Premier League champions will host Barca at the Etihad Stadium on February 24 before a trip to the Nou Camp three weeks later. Sportsmail guides you through the mouthwatering second round clash. Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero do battle in the same fixture at the same stage last season . Will Manchester City be happy with their draw? Well, director of football Txiki Begiristain said immediately after the draw that City were 'very confident'. And who can blame them given the last couple of weeks? 'We have plenty of confidence with the way we qualified beating Bayern Munich at home and Roma away,' he said. 'The players will be working hard to get fit and arrive in confidence for those games. Have the two teams met before? Just a bit - this is exactly the same tie as last season's second round. City were beaten 4-1 on aggregate, largely thanks to Martin Demichelis horror performance at the Etihad Stadium. Manuel Pellegrini's side were barely in it from the off. Who do Manchester City have to watch out? A certain Lionel Messi is said to be a dab hand in these Champions League knockout games and is certain to cause even the very best all sorts of problems. Barcelona's Messi has proven a thorn in the side of a number of top clubs over the last decade . Whether Luis Suarez is able to arrest his slump since joining the Catalans over the summer remains to be seen, and encouragingly for City, the Uruguayan only scored once in four games against them while at Liverpool. An awful lot rests on the shoulders of Sergio Aguero, so the importance of Gerard Pique cannot be underestimated; he is the sort of defender who is capable of shackling the Argentine in full flight. And what about the managers? Luis Enrique is very much a novice at this level and that could be the sort of weakness City try and play on. Manuel Pellegrini is one of the best tactical coaches in Europe and definitely has the upper hand over the young boss. Manuel Pellegrini is one of the most tactically astute managers in European elite football . What kind of draw is it for the fans? Supporters flying from Manchester to Barcelona can get tickets for around £250, so it's not the cheapest option available from the draw. That coupled with the fact many will have been at last season's second leg doesn't make it as appealing as you'd perhaps imagine. From the airport, hop on a train to Sants station and then take the green metro line to Les Corts. What has it done for Manchester City's chances of winning the Champions League? No bookie seems to know what's going to happen here - the odds of both sides winning the competition have actually lengthened. There weren't too many draws more favourable than this for City, particularly given Barcelona's indifference under Enrique, although it was they who drifted the furthest afterwards.","Champions League draw throws up Manchester City against Barcelona .

"Loic Remy has labelled Liverpool 'dishonest' after the striker's move to Anfield fell through due to a failed medical. The new Chelsea forward was poised to join Liverpool for £8million from Queens Park Rangers, but the Premier League club pulled out of the agreement after Remy's medical tests.

The England defender saw a specialist on Wednesday after he was injured in last Sunday’s 2-1 defeat at Manchester United, having initially undergone scans on Monday.

Obviously, it’s a little bit of a setback because you don’t want to lose any players, but in John’s case we were very worried in the moment that it happened because those injuries can become a little bit difficult to treat.

"A man accused of burning his girlfriend's 5-month-old son so badly that part of the child's left leg had to be amputated has pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge in central Ohio. Twenty-year-old Zachariah Keen, of Mount Vernon, entered the plea Tuesday in Knox County court, avoiding a scheduled trial. Two child endangering charges were dismissed. Guilty: Zachariah Keen, pictured, pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge on Tuesday. Keen was accused of burning his girlfriend's 5-month-son so badly part of the child's leg had to be amputated . Girlfriend: Mother Lora Miller's baby also needed skin grafts on one arm . According to Fox28, Keen said 'I was going to give him a bottle and I heated it in a microwave for too long of a time.' 'I then had this occurrence and the baby was burned,' he also said. 'And I did not seek help right away because I did not know the severity of the burn at the time.' The affiliate station reported '[t]he child's father Zach Hammons appeared angry and had tears streaming down his face during Keen's confession.' Fox28 reported the child is in Hammon's custody. Keen will be sentenced next month. A message left with his attorney from the Associated Press wasn't immediately returned. Prosecutors have said Keen told police he tripped and spilled a baby bottle of hot water while baby-sitting in mid-January, but authorities didn't believe the second- and third-degree burns were accidental. Keen was accused of knowingly hurting and failing to seek appropriate medical help for the child, who also needed skin grafts on one arm. In January following the incident, the baby's mother Lora Miller told Mount Vernon News 'the burn is to the bone.'

"Socceroos star Tim Cahill has been connected to an alleged tax avoidance scheme in the UK that has embroiled more than 200 wealthy British celebrities and investors. The fund was created by Ingenious Media in 2008 to take advantage of a policy set up by Gordon Brown when he was Chancellor, which allowed investors to slash their tax bills if they backed the film industry. Scroll down for video . Socceroos star Tim Cahill has been linked to an alleged tax avoidance scheme in the UK . Documents show Cahill, who currently plays for the New York Red Bulls, is one of 229 sports stars, actors and politicians who paid a total of £1.2 billion ($2.2 billion) into Phoenix, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. The film funding scheme was initially approved by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), but HMRC officials now believe that Phoenix might have been aimed primarily at avoiding tax and not bolstering the British film industry. There is no suggestion Phoenix investors did anything illegal but HMRC officials wrote to them in May last year rejecting their claims for tax relief. It is not known how much each individual paid into Phoenix but the average amount was £5.2million, and the minimum investment amount to be eligible for tax breaks was £100,000. The football player has been linked to the alleged tax avoidance scheme . Among those who invested in schemes connected to Ingenious Media are David and Victoria Beckham, Tory MP Geoffrey Cox QC, Sir Michael Caine, and British celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. Last month Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall said he left Phoenix in June after first joining in 2008 believing he was making a 'bona fide' investment in the British film industry. David Beckham those who invested in schemes connected to Ingenious Media . He added: 'It seems from reports in the media that HMRC does have reservations about some of these types of investments. 'I always want to be transparent about and indeed comfortable with my investments and my tax affairs, so earlier this year I resigned my subscription to this particular investment and handed back all the tax gain I had made, plus interest, to HMRC.' Phoenix bought the distribution and production rights to  the 2010 re-make of the 1980s TV series The A-Team and Gulliver' s Travels. Investors could make significant profits if the films prospered at the box office. However, Ingenious Media, which ran the partnership, admitted in 2011 that 'box office performance had not met expectations' and was unlikely to deliver 'significant upside'. Regardless of the poor returns, investors were able to claim tax relief worth about half the cash they put in. Phoenix is one of more than 1,200 alleged avoidance schemes identified by HMRC where investors are being forced to hand over unpaid tax before their disputes are settled by a tribunal. . Ingenious has denied that Phoenix, or any of its other film  investment schemes, are tax-avoidance structures.

"'In no way careless': The family of Amber Vinson, who has Ebola, vigorously defended her conduct . The family of a Dallas nurse who cared for Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan then caught the disease herself have angrily denied she was 'careless' in flying to Ohio and back while carrying the virus. Amber Vinson, 29, who works at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, caught Ebola after helping to care for Duncan. She then went on a trip to Ohio and back - and was hospitalized with the virulent illness hours after her return. In the wake of her trip 153 people are being monitored for signs of the disease, and three are in quarantine. In a statement released by her family today, they say Vinson would never 'knowingly' put anybody at risk, was vigilant in testing herself for signs, and followed all the relevant protocols. The statement attacked any suggestion that she ignored medical or government guidelines. Medical staff dealing with Ebola are allowed to fly provided they wore protective gear while dealing with the virus. The statement said she reported her body temperature three times before boarding her flight home last week.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged Vinson checked in repeatedly and was cleared for travel. Cleveland station WOIO reported the family's statement and said that they feel public comments and media outlets 'mischaracterize Amber and her actions'. It said: 'Suggestions that she ignored any of the physician and government-provided protocols recommended to her are patently untrue and hurtful. Scroll down for video . Infection scare: 153 people are being monitored - and three are under quarantine - in Ohio as a result of a visit Vinson made while unknowingly carrying Ebola . Police line: Police keep watch over the house in Ohio where Vinson stayed with her stepfather, who is one of the three in quarantine . 'Although the majority of the correspondences we have received since her diagnosis have been positive, we are troubled by some of the negative public comments and media coverage that mischaracterize Amber and her actions . 'To be clear, in no way was Amber careless prior to or after her exposure to Mr. Thomas Eric Duncan. She has not and would not knowingly expose herself or anyone else.' Three people have been quarantined in northeast Ohio following Vinson's visit to Cleveland to prepare for her wedding. None of the three, quarantined after new monitoring guidelines by the state, has exhibited Ebola-like symptoms. Treatment: Vinson is now being cared for in Atlanta, having originally been admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian, where she works . Flight: Vinson went to Ohio after treating Thomas Eric Duncan. She checked whether she could fly and got approval from the CDC. By the time her flight home landed she had a fever . 'Patient zero': Thomas Eric Duncan was the first person to die of Ebola in the United States. He brought the virus over from Liberia, his homeland, and died on October 8 . Every day, the Ebola sufferers in the United States and their caregivers produce an astonishing eight 55-gallon barrels of medical waste PER DAY. Masks, gloves, linens, utensils, medical instruments--everything the patient contacts must be destroyed and the garbage is piling up. While one surefire way to destroy the pathogen is to incinerate the waste, some states have already said 'no way' to requests they accept the tainted garbage. Missouri's attorney general has even made moves to bar Ebola-contaminated waste from being destroyed at a St. Louis facility, reports the LA Times. Earlier this month, a Louisiana waste disposal site refused to accept the ashes generated when a Thomas Eric Duncan's belongings from his apartment were incinerated and a judge even signed an order temporarily blocking the disposal in the state. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said during a news conference that the virus is not considered to be hardy in the environment and that incineration and chemical treatment of the infected waste is sufficient to remove any risk. Initially, only Vinson's stepfather had been quarantined, in his home in suburban Akron. The two others, in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, and in Summit County, were quarantined after. Ohio governor John Kasich ordered the new guidelines, which include travel restrictions, on Saturday. A state health official said the guidelines are meant to remove any chance of Ebola spreading. 'As we've seen, travel is a potential problem,' state epidemiologist Dr. Mary DiOrio said. 'It's why the people of Ohio are dealing with the situation we have right now.' Under the guidelines, anyone who has had direct contact with the skin, mucus membranes, blood or bodily fluids of someone diagnosed with Ebola must be quarantined for 21 days. Anyone who did not have direct skin contact but reported spending more than an hour in close proximity to an infected person is not to travel commercially for 21 days. Such people also are to seek permission to travel outside the health jurisdictions where they live. People who were in the same enclosed space as an Ebola carrier are not to travel outside the U.S. Workplace: Vinson is a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital, which treated the United States' first Ebola victim . Kasich said the federal government should ban travel from West African countries hit hardest by the Ebola epidemic, which has killed thousands of people, mainly in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Vinson cared for a man who died from the disease in Dallas. She was diagnosed last week. She flew from Dallas to Cleveland on Oct. 10 and flew back on Oct. 13. Ebola is spread through bodily fluids. Someone who is infected does not become contagious until he or she shows symptoms of the disease. Health officials have said Vinson exhibited some symptoms while in Ohio. There are 153 people being monitored in Ohio because of contact or potential contact with Vinson. They include people with whom Vinson had direct contact, those who visited the Akron bridal shop where her bridesmaids tried on dresses on Oct. 11 and those who were passengers on the flights she took. Vinson is being cared for at a specialized unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Her family said she is a 'deeply committed nurse driven by a fundamental passion for helping others.' One of Vinson's Dallas hospital colleagues, Nina Pham, also is being treated for Ebola.","Vinson, 29, works at Dallas hospital that cared for Thomas Eric Duncan .

"By . Simon Carr . A daring World War 2 hero who captured 42 German soldiers armed only with his trusty Scottish sword has been ranked as one of the world's greatest adventurers. Lieutenant Colonel John Malcolm 'Mad Jack' Churchill is featured in a new book compiled by the Norwegian Royal Explorers Club which honours the finest explorers and adventurers of all time. He is known for his courageous exploits, including making the last recorded bow and arrow kill in wartime, saving 500 people in Jerusalem from certain death and capturing German troops with the use of his Claybeg sword - a smaller version of a Claymore. Mad Jack made the last wartime kill with a bow and arrow and represented Great Britain at and international archery contest . When once asked about the basket-hilted blade, Churchill - who prepared his men for battle by playing bagpipes - said: 'In my opinion, any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly dressed.' Espen Lazarus, co-founder of the Royal Explorers Club, and researcher of the currently untitled book, said: 'When we first read the stories of Jack Churchill, it immediately become obvious that it would strengthen the book greatly to tell his tale. 'The common trait for all our club members is a desire for adventure and the book we are writing is a homage to the explorers that have inspired us.' The book, which is set to be released . in summer, will see the Lt Colonel commemorated among the likes of . American frontiersman Hugh Glass and evolutionary biologist Charles . Darwin. The Royal Explorers . Club, founded in 2003, is devoted to celebrating adventure and . exploration and has members working across the globe. Espen . added: 'I would rate Jack Churchill as one of, if not the most, . inspirational and impressive people we have researched in relation to . the book. 'His key traits . that contribute to this impression are of course his resilience, . somewhat demanding leadership style and obvious disregard for danger.'

The picture was sent to him by German officer Wilhelm Herz (left, facing camera) in 1969 . Lt. Churchill (far right) leading the charge at Maaloy, Finland with his sword in hand . Lt Colonel Churchill regularly brought his trusty basket-hilted Claybeg sword, a set of bagpipes and a longbow into battle. Born in Surrey in 1906 he graduated from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and joined the 2nd Battalion of the Manchester Regiment in 1926. His glittering career won him two Distinguished Service Orders and the Military Cross. His son, Malcolm Churchill, 71, also from Surrey, explained when these weapons were used. He said: 'He would use the bagpipes to rouse the troops before battle and he's the last soldier to be credited with killing somebody with a bow and arrow.' 'Mad Jack' made the last ever recorded bow and arrow kill in WW2 when he shot a German officer in 1940 while holding the village of l'Epinette in France. Malcolm added: 'He and his section were in a tower and as the Germans approached he said, 'I will shoot that first German with an arrow' and that's exactly what he did and they held the rest off with machine guns.' Lt Colonel Churchill used his bagpipes to raise the morale of his troops and lower that of the enemy. He launched into a rousing rendition of the March of the Cameron Men before raiding a German garrison in Operation Archery in Vaagso, Norway in 1941. Lt Churchill playing the bagpipes. he famously played the instrument to rouse his troops . After recovering from an injury he sustained in the operation, he further raised his profile by leading troops through Sicily and then the landings in Salerno. It was here that, with the help of a corporal, he captured 42 German troops and a mortar crew with just the use of his Claybeg. But on a later assignment in Yugoslavia in 1944, he and his troops were struck by a German attack and he was sent to the notorious Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Malcolm said: 'He shouldn't have been captured inasmuch as he was a colonel and shouldn't have been in the front lines. 'However he was a fighting soldier and he didn't care much for being at the back filling out paperwork.' Lt Churchill at the barrel of a gun in Belgium. He died in 1996 aged 89 .

True to form, Lt Colonel Churchill managed to escape but was recaptured and sent to a PoW camp in Austria. After escaping a second time, Churchill walked 150 miles over to Verona, Italy where he met with an American column who sent him to England. Despite these amazing feats, however, Mad Jack, who died in 1996 at the age of 89, didn't spend much time boasting. Malcolm added: 'He didn't brag about these things at all but he would be happy to talk to anyone who asked, particularly if it was over a couple of nice glasses of wine in the evening. Mother ran the house, not him. Father was quite happy to have things quiet at home.' Mad Jack's civilian efforts were nearly as impressive as his wartime feats as he represented Great Britain in the 1939 World Archery Championships, worked as a professional bagpiper, played roles in films such as Ivanhoe and The Thief of Baghdad, and was commemorated in a comic strip. Malcolm added: 'He was slightly eccentric. He had very unusual taste but was happy so long as he was doing his own thing.' His feats also include motorcycling across Burma and helping to save 500 Jewish doctors and patients during the Hadassah medical convoy massacre in 1948.

"Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is not anything like Mario Kart – a statement that may come as a shock to some, but is – in fact, wholly justified. For developers Sumo Digital have not simply repackaged Nintendo’s winning formula, but have carved their own niche. The result is a wonderful, often moving, tribute to the golden age of gaming – a high speed trip down memory lane exploring the titles which shaped video game history. Vibrant: Graphics stay true to each one of SEGA's masterpieces, while giving them a current-gen twist. Thankfully, every bit of SEGA’s work has been handled with respect and care. You’ll race across the aircraft carrier decks made famous in Afterburner, meander through the orange canyons of Panzer Dragoon, and weave through rivers of lava in Golden Axe. The visuals, too, are exceptional – striking a perfect balance between achieving nostalgia without taking away from each one’s distinct artistic direction. Colours are vibrant, draw distances impressive and every mascot has been lovingly restored in pixel-perfect glory. Refreshingly, gameplay has had as much love and care spent on it, too. For starters, it doesn’t simply involve driving around in a cart. Instead, your vehicle can transform into a boat or plane to adapt to the ever-changing levels. Laps are rarely the same, and see you gliding through the skies one minute, and tackling waves the next. All vehicles handle very differently. In cart mode, you can drift around corners to accumulate boost, while you’re encouraged to zip through checkpoints when in plane form. Boats bob up and down gleefully, handling in a way reminiscent of Wave Racer. It’s this variation in gameplay that makes the career mode so enjoyable – all too often the weakest hand in these sort of games. There’s even an XP system, which allows you to upgrade your character and their vehicle. Other modes include World Tour, Grand Prix and Battle Arenas. Multiplayer, though, is where most of the fun is – both offline or when taking on up to 10 players online. Old favourites: There's a large roster of SEGA stars to choose from, each with their own powers and cart. Although graphics and frame rate take a hit when competing in split-screen mode, there are wonderfully inventive party modes (that are best left a surprise), as well as more traditional racing. That’s what best describes All-Stars Racing…’a surprise’. A game that stands head and shoulders above every carting game of recent years, and one – like the titles it pays tribute to – will be remembered and cherished.

"The center of a Quebec town has been wiped out, according to the mayor, after a runaway freight train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded in a fireball at 1am on Saturday. One person was killed and about 30 buildings were destroyed as the unmanned train exploded. About 60 people are believed to be missing, but the force of the fire has slowed rescue efforts. Parts of the town were evacuated in the early hours as fireballs shot several metres in the air, flames spread to nearby homes and thick acrid smoke filled the air in Lac-Megantic, which is close to the Maine border and about 250km from Montreal. Scroll down for videos: . Fireball: A cloud of fire is blasted into the sky above Lac Megantic after a freight train exploded . Explosive: Balls of fire and thick smoke fill the sky above Lac Megantic after a train carrying crude oil derailed . The name of the person killed in the blaze, caused by a runaway Montreal Maine & Atlantic train, has not yet been named. The train's conductor, who was in a hotel at the town at the time of the crash, is being questioned by police, according to CTV News. He had parked the train in Nantes, about 12km away, as he waited for someone to take over his shift, when it somehow 'got released', the railway company's vice-president Joseph McGonigle said. 'We're not sure what happened, but the engineer did everything by the book. He had parked the train and was waiting for his relief,' he added. The train's engine was found about 1km from where the explosions took place, creating what authorities have described as 'a war zone'. About 30 shops and homes in the town center, including the library and local weekly newspaper's office, were destroyed by the fire, which is being dealt with by firefighters from Quebec and Maine. 'Words cannot tell the damage that had been done,' Sergeant Gregory Gomez del Prado, of Quebec Police, said.  'Many, many buildings have been damaged. It’s a catastrophe for the town of course, but also for the whole province.' Scorched: Burnt out cars and rubble can be seen as the railway cars continue to burn . Extensive: The damage caused by the runaway train extends over a couple of blocks in the town center . Wiped out: Piles of brick are all that remain of several buildings close to where the rail cars exploded . Witnesses said the blast flattened an apartment building and part of a bar, which had a terrace packed with people at the time of the fire, according to CBC. Yvon Rosa had just left the bar when he saw the runaway train. 'I have never seen a train traveling that quickly into the center of Lac-Megantic,' he said. 'I saw the wagons come off the tracks ... everything exploded. In just one minute the center of the town was covered in fire.' The ferocity of the blaze has made authorities fear for the safety of many of the lakeside town's 6,000 residents. About 120 firefighters are still trying to contain the fire in the town center. 'When you see the center of your town . almost destroyed, you'll understand that we're asking ourselves how we . are going to get through this event,' the town's mayor, Colette . Roy-Laroche, said. 'We're told some people are missing but . they may just be out of town or on vacation,' Lieutenant Michel Brunet, . of Quebec police, said. A Facebook page has been set up to help friends and family check on their loved ones, according to the Toronto Star. Devastation: Residents said the explosion looked the the end of the world, as thick smoke and flames filled the sky . Rescue: As the town was evacuated residents watched in horror as the fire spread . Destruction: About 30 buildings in the center of the town, near the border with Maine, have burnt down . About 250 residents have taken shelter in a Red Cross center set up in the town's high school, and more are expected to arrive there later today. 'Many parents are worried because they haven't been able to communicate with a member of their family or an acquaintance,' Ms Roy-Laroche said. Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper has sent his sympathy to the stricken town. 'Thoughts & prayers are with those impacted in Lac Megantic. Horrible news,' he said on Twitter. Flames . could be seen from several miles away as the fire spread to several . homes after the 73-car Montreal Maine & Atlantic train, which was . heading towards Maine, derailed. Zeph Kee, who lives about half an hour from Lac-Megantic, told CBC: 'It was total mayhem ... people not finding their kids.' Resident Anne-Julie Hallee, who saw the explosion, said: 'It was like the end of the world.' Another resident, Claude Bedard, said: 'It's terrible. We've never seen anything like it. The Metro store, Dollarama, everything that was there is gone.' Still burning: Flames and smoke pour from one of the wagons hours after the derailment . Locator: The Montreal Maine & Atlantic train derailed about 250km from Montreal . Doused: Water is sprayed on to a burning rail car close to the railway track . Rubble: The remains of a building flattened in the blast can be seen through the smoke . Only 1,000 litres of oil on board the train has been recovered, and firefighters said that all of the 73 cars were on fire, according to a press conference held in the town on Saturday afternoon. A lot of the oil has leaked into a lake and the Chaudiere River, and plumes of thick smoke could be seen from about 10km away, nearly 10 hours after the blast. A 1km section of the town has been cordoned off and boats have been banned from coming close on the river, after flames were allegedly seen in two aqueducts. 'We have a mobile laboratory here to monitor the quality of the air,' Environment Quebec spokesman Christian Blanchette said. 'Firefighters are working hard to extinguish that fire, but it’s burning hard because of the crude oil,' Gergeant Gomez del Prado said,adding that it would take a while for the fire to be contained. 'We also have a spill on the lake and . the river that is concerning us. We have advised the local . municipalities downstream to be careful if they take their water from . the Chaudiere River.' Firefighters . have set up a perimeter around the town as they try to tackle the . blaze, which was caused when four of the cars that were pressurized blew . up. Derailment: Smoke is still filling the streets around where the 73-car freight train derailed . Pollution: Environmental workers are monitoring the plumes of smoke, as well as contamination of a river . 'There are still wagons which we think are pressurized. We're not sure because we can't get close, so we're working on the assumption that all the cars were pressurized and could explode. That's why progress is slow and tough,' local fire chief Denis Lauzon said. The cause of the derailment is not yet known. The railway company's Mr McGonigle, said the middle section of the train had derailed, the Montreal Gazette said. Investigators are headed to the town to begin gathering information and statements from witnesses.","First confirmed victim of freight train fire .

"Take a look at these two photos. Can you see any difference between them? A little, but not too much? Good, that is exactly how it should be. The pictures were taken a week apart — I think you’ll agree that in the second one, I look a little sharper, fresher, more alive. Nothing too revolutionary or extreme, though. In fact, most people have assumed I’ve just had a really lovely, relaxing Christmas break. Which is precisely what I intended. Scroll down for video . Before: Helen, 46, (pictured) went in for the new threadlift treatment at winner of The Apprentice Dr Leah Tottton's clinic in London before the school-run one day . You see, a few weeks ago, before the school-run, I nipped out for a threadlift — known in the cosmetic surgery world as a ‘non-surgical’ or ‘lunchtime’ facelift — at the London clinic of Dr Leah Totton, the 25-year-old winner of 2013’s The Apprentice. It’s said to be the most furtive, discreet and effective facelift of all. My surgeon, Dr Roberto Pizzamiglio, trained Leah, along with hundreds of other medics, in how to perform the Silhouette Soft lift, in which fine threads with tiny cones along the length of them are sewn into the face, beneath the subcutaneous layer of fat, with a needle, then pulled tight, gently lifting sagging skin. As it takes just half-an-hour and there is no recovery time, the procedure, which is available at clinics the length and breadth of the country for around £1,200, could be — and frequently is — performed during a lunch break, leaving colleagues none the wiser. After: Helen, 46, (pictured) underwent the half hour procedure, which has no recovery time, and was thrilled with the results . In fact, if you decided to greet inevitable comments like ‘Gosh, you look well’ and ‘You must tell me which foundation you use’ with a knowing smile, no one need ever know you’d succumbed to a secret moment of vanity. While I’m all for gilding the lily (I never leave home without a good smearing of make-up and regularly have my grey hair highlighted), I never imagined I would go so far as to have foreign bodies inserted in my face in my quest for eternal youth. But I became far more receptive to the idea a few months ago when, aged 46, I was shown an alarmingly jowly profile photograph of myself, taken by my ten-year-old daughter Isobel. I’d not seen myself in profile for some time and struggled with the harsh truth: my face, like the rest of me, was heading south. Dr Roberto Pizzamiglia (left) and Dr Leah Totton (right) performed the threadlift procedure on Helen at The Apprentice winner's clinic in London . Shortly afterwards, while washing up, I caught sight of my reflection in the kitchen window and recoiled in shock, actually believing I’d seen a vision of my mother, who died six years ago aged 82. A more public low-point followed one evening when, on my way home from work, a woman in her 30s stood up to offer me her seat on the Tube. Not so long ago, that act of kindness would have propelled me on to a crash diet, convinced she thought I looked pregnant. But it was so much worse to have to face up to simply looking old. Going under the scalpel was out of the question. Apart from the huge expense and weeks of recovery, as the mother of three children — aged 13, ten and six — I couldn’t justify risking a general anaesthetic unless it was absolutely necessary. Effects of the treatment are meant to last around 18 months, at which point the threads and cones biodegrade and are absorbed into the body . So, the Silhouette Soft threadlift, done using a local anaesthetic, sounded like the perfect solution. Better still, the results promised to be subtle and discreet, so there was no danger of me looking like Jocelyn Wildenstein — infamous as the Bride of Wildenstein after extreme plastic surgery wrecked her face. While threadlifts have for years been the beauty treatment of choice for the rich and famous — Madonna is understood to be among them — who want to rejuvenate without looking like they’ve been through a wind tunnel, what’s new about the Silhouette Soft technique are its ‘bi-directional cones’. With the procedure’s previous incarnation, the cones only pointed downwards, embedding themselves into the facial tissue to keep the thread in place, and at the same time causing inflammation beneath the skin to stimulate production of collagen, the protein that provides scaffolding for the face. The needle and thread are pushed upwards beneath the skin to the exit point near the hairline, the thread was pulled taut at both ends, so that the cones nudge the facial tissues northwards . But these new threads (developed in the U.S. and introduced here last year) are dotted with cones pointing up and down. As well as stimulating collagen production, the upward ones push into facial tissue, making skin tauter and giving more of a lift. Effects are meant to last around 18 months, at which point the threads and cones — which contain polylactic acid, the biologically-compatible substance used in suture threads and orthopaedic pins — biodegrade and are absorbed into the body. And so I made an appointment with Dr Pizzamiglio at Dr Leah’s clinic, in Moorgate, London. The ten local anaesthetic injections into each side of my face were, I was relieved to discover, the worst part of the whole procedure. Red dots were drawn to indicate where the threads would go in and out of my face. Then, as I lay on the bed, covered in sterile paper, I could vaguely feel the surgeon, assisted by Dr Leah, injecting a needle — to which the 30cm thread and cones were attached — into the centre of my cheek. Once both the threads  have been place in one side of the face, the doctor turns to the other side to create the same lift in the second cheek - Helen is pictured here during the procedure . It travelled 5mm from the top layer of skin (the epidermis) through the dermis, the subcutaneous tissue, the collagen and stopped just past the fibroblasts (the skin cells that make connective tissues). The needle and thread were pushed upwards beneath my skin to the exit point near my hairline, which was pricked with another needle to make a hole for the needle and thread to come through. The thread was pulled taut at both ends, so that the downward-pointing cones embedded into the subcutaneous fat and the upward cones nudged the facial tissues northwards. A second thread was inserted in the same way, further up my face, close to my cheekbones, and pulled upwards then downwards, until it was taut and embedded. As with many medical processes there was some blood visible at the end of the process and some had even run into Helen's hair . With both of the threads in place on my right side, the doctor turned to creating the same lift on my left cheek. The whole process took just 30 minutes, though it felt far longer — despite my efforts not to dwell on what was happening. Inevitably, there was some blood and, when the surgeon handed me a mirror, I was taken aback to see some had run into my hair. Back home, the children couldn’t see past the blood, and begged for the gory details. But my husband — a hardened doubter of cosmetic surgery — was astounded. Helen is pictured here after the procedure, her kids were keen to know the gory details, while her husband was astounded by the results . He even compared my new face to a picture that hangs on our landing, in which I’m holding Isobel as a baby ten years ago. I couldn’t have hoped for a lovelier comment. In the days afterwards, I was told to keep the incision points clean, dry and infection-free: showers were out, as was make-up. Also banned were saunas, contact sport and dental surgery, while the tissue around the cones healed. I was also ordered to sleep on my back for five nights — the biggest problem of all. Even without make-up, I could see I looked much better: like a fresher, less exhausted version of myself. And because the reflection staring back at me appeared less tired, I felt like I had more energy. Helen, pictured after the treatment, was thrilled with the results and can see that even without make-up she looks like a 'fresher, less exhausted version' of herself . The following Saturday, I met up with my friend Rachael, who I’ve known since playgroup. I hadn’t told her about my threadlift and her first reaction on seeing me was: ‘Wow, you look great! Sooo well.’ My sister, Louise, an advanced nurse practitioner who administers Botox and fillers, is also thinking about training to do threadlifts, after seeing my results on Skype. ‘It’s knocked a decade off you!’ she said. ‘Yet your face still looks natural — just plumper and less lined.’ That plumping effect should be even more noticeable over the next few months as more collagen is produced, thanks to stimulation from the cones. But will I tell anyone what I’ve had done next time they ask? Probably not. This is my little secret. Visit silhouette-soft.com .","Threadlifts are the new 'non-surgical' facelifts available .

"Scorned spouse: Officials say Adam Garibay murdered the man he discovered was having an affair with his wife . A Texas Border Patrol agent has been arrested on suspicion of killing a man he discovered was having an affair with his wife. Adam Garibay, 33, of Corpus Christi, discovered the affair online early Thursday, brutally beat and restrained his wife, then drove more than two hours north to murder Keith Martin, officials said. He then took police on a high speed chase before being run off the road and Tazed into submission. Mr Garibay’s young son witnessed the distraught man restrain his wife, 28, with duct tape and handcuffs before running to a neighbors for help while he sped off, KSAT reported. Mr Garibay discovered the Facebook affair and immediately confronted his wife, demanding to know where Mr Martin, 35, lived, police told KSAT. 'They were having an affair. She got caught,’ Medina County Sheriff Randy Brown told the San Antonio Express. When she resisted, he restrained her with duct tape and handcuffs, forcing her to give them Mr Martin’s Hondo, Texas address, authorities said. ‘He was able to get from her by threat the address of the man,’ Mr Brown told KSAT. The scorned spouse then drove more than 160 miles north to Mr Martin’s Hondo, Texas home to confront him about the affair.

Authorities were made aware of the murder plot when they arrived to free Ms Martin. Police told KIII they found her ‘pretty severely beat up… tied up with duct tape around her face, her legs, the tape behind her arms, waist, everywhere.’ It is not clear if Mr Garibay walked in and opened fire, or if there was an altercation before shots were fired, but police have fingered the Border Patrol agent as the main suspect in the killing. KRISTV reported that members of Mr Martin’s family witnessed his murder. Ran off the road: Mr Garibay then took deputies on a high speed chase in this car before being run off the road . Next stop: Mr Garibay was taken to a hospital for unspecified injuries, but his next stop will be Medina County Jail . Police say Mr Martin then led them on a high speed chase for 18 miles before being rammed off the road. He was then shot by deputies with a Taser before finally being taken into custody. ‘They did an outstanding job,’ Mr Brown told the Express, praising the deputies. ‘This guy was still armed.’ It is not clear if Mr Martin was armed with his service weapon or a personal firearm when he was apprehended. The suspected killer was taken to a local hospital for treatment of unspecified injuries. He will eventually face multiple charges in both Corpus Christi and Medina County.

"Prince Harry was launched into a new leading role in the royal family last night when he took centre stage at the Olympic closing ceremony. In his most important solo Royal engagement yet, the third in line to the throne was selected as the figurehead for the spectacular farewell to the Games, which the Queen opened two weeks ago. The high-profile task of celebrating Britain’s glory at London 2012 fell to the 27-year-old prince, sitting alongside the Duchess of Cambridge, after a succession of prominent appearances in the crowd at many of the history-making events of the competition. He stepped in after his brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, had to return to work as a search-and-rescue helicopter pilot at RAF Valley in North Wales. Scroll down for video .

In a separate message, the Queen . congratulated the athletes of Great Britain and the Commonwealth, saying . their efforts had ‘captured the public’s imagination and earned their . admiration’. The monarch said Team GB’s success - . the best performance in more than a century - would inspire a new . generation of Olympians and remind everyone how sport 'unifies . communities and nations'.

Phillips win an equestrian team silver medal. He and his brother Prince William gave . an extraordinary TV interview last week in which they spoke with . chat-show casualness about how much they were enjoying the Olympics.

"Angel di Maria's imminent move to Manchester United is a step closer after he passed a medical ahead of his £59.7million plus add ons deal from Real Madrid. The deal, which would be a British transfer fee record, would see Di Maria earn £200,000-a-week wages over a five-year contract.

"There is an 800lb elephant in the room for this Australian Open semi-final in the shape of Dani Vallverdu, but my advice would be: don’t make it personal. Andy Murray’s match with Tomas Berdych will be won between the lines of the tennis court, although there is no doubt it can be strange for all concerned when a coach switches corners. I experienced this in 2003 in my first match as a coach against Andre Agassi following our eight-year association. I was working with Andy Roddick at Queen’s Club and he won in three sets against Andre. The whole experience gave me a vaguely sick feeling. Andy Murray celebrates his straight sets win over Nick Kyrgios in the quarter-finals . Murray is set to come up against his long-term friend Dani Vallverdu, who now coaches Berdych . The key to this match is whether Murray can maintain the more aggressive style he has been playing. The stats don’t lie and there is a reason Andy has a 4-6 record against the Czech: too often he has tried to beat him relying on his more defensive game and most of the time it has not worked. If I was coaching Andy, I would tell him he needs to keep playing ‘first-strike’ tennis — being aggressive with the first ball that is there to hit. He has to take the ball on if it is anywhere near the centre of the court, and must avoid giving Berdych ‘meatballs’, those more passive plays that give him the chance to belt heavy groundstroke winners. The second serve will be crucial for Andy. He has been averaging 87mph on it here as opposed to 84mph in 2014 — an improvement, but still not enough by the highest standards. Novak Djokovic tends to average around 100mph and Murray needs to get closer to that. Tomas Berdych is Murray's next opponent after he saw off Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-0, 7-6 in the quarter-finals . Murray, working on his serve in practice on Wednesday, will have to serve well against the big hitting Czech . If the Czech has a weakness, it is that his second serve tends to be the most predictable of the top 10, but there are already signs Vallverdu is doing a good job coaching him. Tomas is picking when to really go for a winner much better. Before he would strike out too soon, especially when out wide, but now he is more intelligent. Another key for Tomas is that, at 29, he has improved his movement around the court significantly. Conditions are going to play a part. If, as expected, it is a cool evening and the ball flies relatively slowly, that favours the greater power of Berdych. But if it is significantly breezy, then Murray’s control is superior in the wind. Put me on the spot and I will say that there will be four tight sets, with the Brit going through to another final. The two-time Grand Slam champion has been in fine form so far in Melbourne, aiming for a fourth final .","Andy Murray faces Tomas Berdych in Australian Open semis on Thursday .

"England's players were finally able to get out and train in the Miami heat on Tuesday after the weather held off. Roy Hodgson's squad had expected to have their first training session on Monday, but it was washed out because of a storm, forcing the players to train in the gym instead.Thankfully the weather was much improved on Tuesday, with conditions inside the Sun Life Stadium - home of the Miami Dolphins - so warm and humid that four giant fans were set up by the pitch to help keep staff and players cool.

Gary Neville and Ray Lewington set out cones and mannequins on an immaculate surface ready for the outfield exercises.

"Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly has fired back at former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee for calling New York women 'trashy' for swearing. 'I do have news for you before I let you go,' she told him on her show, The Kelly File, on Wednesday. 'We are not only swearing. We're drinking, we're smoking, we're having premarital sex with birth control, before we go to work and sometimes boss around a bunch of men.' After Kelly, who lives in New York City, made the comments, Huckabee laughed, saying: 'I just don't want to hear that.' Scroll down for video . Not impressed: Fox News' Megyn Kelly educated Mike Huckabee on the ways of the modern woman on her show on Wednesday after he said it was 'trashy' that New York women swore in the workplace . Her comments came after Huckabee, who quit his show on Fox News earlier this month, described his shock at hearing women swear in the workplace while he worked in New York. 'In the South, or in the Midwest, there in Iowa, you would not have people who would just throw the F-bomb or use gratuitous profanity in a professional setting,' Huckabee, 59, told host Jan Mickelson. 'In New York, not only do the men do it, but the women... My gosh, this is worse than locker-room talk. As we would say in the South, that's just trashy.' After Politico published an article saying he had been referring to his female colleagues at Fox News, he sought to clarify what he had said. 'I never said anything derogatory about the people at Fox News,' he told radio host Tyler Cralle, who is based in North Carolina, on Wednesday. 'I talked about the overall coarseness of conversation and gratuitous profanity that I hear in places in what I call the bubble zoo like New York, Washington and Hollywood.' Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, announced earlier this month he is considering running for president. He is pictured after speaking at the Freedom Summit in Des Moines, Iowa on Saturday . He said it was 'an outright lie' that he was referring to women at Fox. Huckabee, who joined Fox in 2008, quit the network earlier this month as he announced he is thinking of running for president. He ran in the Republican presidential primaries in 2008. The latest furor comes less that two weeks after he slammed Beyoncé and Jay-Z for their explicit lyrics in his book, and suggested that the rapper was 'exploiting his wife as a sex object'. After making headlines for the comments, he told Fox News: 'You know, if people read the full chapter, it's in the context of, first of all, saying, ""Beyoncé is a wonderful talent."" 'My point is, she doesn't have to do some of the things that she does in the lyrics because it's not necessary. She has nothing to make up for. She's an amazing talent.'

"England coach Steve McNamara is confident his side can overcome the shock of losing new captain Sean O'Loughlin for their opening Four Nations Series clash with Samoa. The influential Wigan loose forward, who was the logical choice to succeed Kevin Sinfield as captain of the national team, has failed to recover from a quad strain sustained in the Warriors' Grand-Final defeat by St Helens 10 days ago. Former St Helens skipper James Graham will lead the side out at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium for the first part of Saturday's double-header while Hull loose forward Joe Westerman will take over the number 13 jersey and win his first cap. Wigan loose forward Sean O'Loughlin will miss England's opening Four Nations Series clash with Samoa. 'Sean tried his best and our medical staff tried their best but the Samoa match has come too soon,' McNamara said. 'We thought it was right that we made an early decision but we remain confident he'll be ready for Australia the week after. 'It's a blow because he's our leader and obviously he's a really, really good player. 'But I'm really happy with his replacement. Joe had a great season for Hull FC, a team that didn't make the top eight, and to be a real stand-out for them shows what a quality player he is. England coach Steve McNamara is confident his team will cope without O'Loughlin . 'James will step in as captain for this week and he's a tremendous leader. We saw that with the (Canterbury) Bulldogs towards the back end of the season when he single-handedly more or less led them to the Grand Final. 'He leads by example and gives 100 per cent effort in everything he does. He inspires everyone around him to follow his lead.' Graham, who is set to skipper his club in 2015, took over the captaincy for England's 2010 Four Nations campaign in the southern hemisphere when Adrian Morley was forced to return home due to injury. McNamara has named two other debutants in his starting line-up - Wigan scrum-half Matty Smith and Hull KR hooker Josh Hodgson - while 2014 Man of Steel Daryl Clark is set to make his England bow from the bench. Former St Helens skipper James Graham will lead England against Samoa at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium . 'There is a slight evolution to the squad this year with some new faces on show,' McNamara said. 'The debutants are exciting and they can prove themselves on the international stage.' Hodgson, who will stay on in Australia at the end of the tour to take up a two-year contract with Canberra Raiders, has been given the number nine jersey but McNamara also expects the Warrington-bound Clark to make an impact. 'Daryl's (the) Man of Steel and has been the best player in the competition this season so there is no doubting his ability,' he said. 'Josh is a tough, tenacious player and I think for this game, his robust start will help us. I think Daryl's undoubted electric speed will also help us when he comes on when the sting goes out of the game.' S Tomkins (New Zealand Warriors); J Charnley (Wigan), K Watkins (Leeds), M Shenton (Castleford), R Hall (Leeds); G Widdop (St George Illawarra), M Smith (Wigan); G Burgess (South Sydney), J Hodgson (Hull KR), J Graham (Canterbury Bulldogs, capt), L Farrell (Wigan), J Tomkins (Wigan), J Westerman (Hull). Replacements: D Clark (Castleford), B Ferres (Huddersfield), T Burgess (South Sydney), C Hill (Warrington). The only surprise is the selection of Joel Tomkins, whose appearance in the Grand Final was only his seventh in rugby league since his return from a three-year stint in the 15-man code, ahead of Super League Dream Team second rower Elliott Whitehead. 'Joel is very experienced and a very good player,' McNamara said. 'He fought his way back into the Wigan team, played in a Grand Final and has been in this group before. He brings a whole lot of leadership and energy into the group. He's a tremendous player to have back with us.' It will be Tomkins' first appearance for three years alongside younger brother Sam, who is one of nine survivors from the team that lost 20-18 to New Zealand in their last match, their World Cup semi-final at Wembley 11 months ago. The Super League-based players have been in Australia for less than a week but McNamara is confident that by Saturday his side will be ready for what could be a tricky opening test. 'We've only had nine days to get ready but we knew that from the outset,' McNamara said. 'The thing with this group is that they are very intelligent players and you generally only have to tell them once or twice and they pick it up. 'We've got some great combinations going. Ideally you would like to test them out in a game situation before the tournament but I'm really confident.' Samoa will make their Four Nations debut under a cloud after three players - Reni Maitua, Tautau Moga and Sauaso Sue - were not considered for selection after it was revealed they are the subject of an NRL Integrity Unit review into an alleged nightclub brawl in Brisbane over the weekend. 'Come game day, they will be past all of that,' McNamara said. 'They will be ready for this game. I don't think it will affect them.'","Wigan loose forward Sean O'Loughlin failed to recover from a calf strain .

"British hopes for a medal at Ibrox were brutally snuffed out as each of the participating home nations lost in the rugby sevens quarter-finals. Another 45,000-strong turned out at the home of football giants Rangers for the second day of action - with the loudest cheer reserved for Scotland as they took on South Africa. But, despite putting up a brave fight, the Glasgow 2014 hosts joined England and Wales in crashing out of the tournament after slumping to a 35-12 defeat. Tough draw: Mark Bennett of Scotland holds off the challenge of Chris Dry of South Africa . Scotland had pushed world champions and four-time Commonwealth champions New Zealand close in Saturday's group-stage meeting but failed to replicate that intensity as they fell three tries behind the Springboks early on. 'We're massively disappointed,' Scotland coach Stevie Gemmell said. 'We made far too many errors against a quality team. 'We didn't learn the lesson from the first half against New Zealand yesterday and the same things happened to us again. 'If you give one of the best teams in the world a 20-point start you will end up with that outcome. 'But I don't think there is a massive gulf between us and the southern-hemisphere teams. We showed against New Zealand what we can do. But we do need to work hard to close the gap further.' Winner: Pama Fou of Australia scores the winning try during their quarter-final against Wales . The Scots found themselves 21-0 down as Cornal Hendricks, Branco du Preez and Seabelo Sentala all crossed over. But Mark Bennett gave his side hope when he pulled a score back just before the break. Expectations rose further when Lee Jones - who scored five tries on the opening day of action - grabbed another at the start of the second half but, when skipper Colin Gregor sent his conversion attempt wide, Scotland's momentum faltered. That allowed South Africa to step up the pressure and Sentala and Cecil Afrika put the seal on their victory with two further touchdowns. There was agony too for Wales in the first last-eight clash of the afternoon. They led Australia 19-7 at half-time but were left sickened after the hooter went when Cam Clark stuck over a last-gasp conversion to seal a 21-19 win and a semi-final slot against the All Blacks. Diving try: Lio Lolo of Samoa is tackled by Philip Burgess of Scotland as he scores a try . And England were also punished with a 15-14 defeat by Samoa. Leading by Marcus Watson's try, they soon found themselves behind as James Rodwell was penalised for his late challenge on Samoa Toloa as he grounded the Pacific Islanders' first score in first-half stoppage time. He was sin-binned and Samoa allowed one last attack before the break. They made the most of it as Toloa ran in another score, while Lio Lolo added a third try early in the second half. Dan Norton pulled one back for the English after running on to his own chip but it was not enough to save their medal hopes, with Samoa now progressing to face South Africa. Rodwell admitted his disappointment but felt his yellow card was harsh. 'It was just the ref's interpretation,' he said. 'Their player was taking his time to put the ball down and I made a challenge on him. The ref said I took him after the whistle had gone. 'We came here for a medal, so to lose like that is annoying.' Scotland now take on England in the plate semi-finals on Sunday evening, while the Welsh meet Kenya.","Scotland crashed out after losing 35-12 to South Africa at Ibrox .

The jellyfish were the bizarre idea of the film's British director Sam Taylor-Johnson. She said: 'We went to this beautiful aquarium and there were these jellyfish. They're so sexual, jellyfish, when you look at them in tanks – just the way they move, the fluidity. 'So there was a scene when we go into Anastasia's world and her head, and we just had these jellyfish on the screen.' Scroll down for video . Erotic fiction: The adaptation of EL James' controversial novel starring Dakota Johnson as Anastasia (left) and Jamie Dornan as her sadistic lover Christian Grey (right) is one of the most anticipate films this year . She added: 'It was beautiful, very impressionistic. Everyone went, 'What the f*** are those jellyfish doing there?' 'So we had to take them out. I wasn't happy to let them go.' Fifty Shades Of Grey, which stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia and Jamie Dornan as her sadistic lover Christian Grey, is one of the most eagerly awaited films of the year, and its trailer has already been viewed more than 45 million times on YouTube. But Taylor-Johnson, 47, said that although the film is true to E L James's best-selling book, it may not be as explicit as people might be hoping for. 'The thing that was most difficult was how and where to pepper the sex, and to not make it feel like it was gratuitous,' she said. 'So it had to be a really strong part of the story, and I had to give characterisation to each sex scene, to make them different. Overruled: Director Sam Taylor-Johnson (pictured) said: 'It was beautiful, very impressionistic... Everyone went, ""What the f*** are those jellyfish doing there?''So we had to take them out' 'I didn't want it to be graphically explicit, and I know that's going to be disappointing to some people.' Taylor-Johnson, who is married to British actor Aaron Johnson, 23, added in an interview with The Guardian newspaper: 'It's the build up and titillation of touch and sensuality. So I don't think it goes into the realm of porn.' She explained there were constraints on sexual content because she wanted the film to earn an 'R' rating in the US – meaning it can be viewed by mainstream audiences. Taylor-Johnson, an artist who also directed the 2009 John Lennon bio-pic Nowhere Boy, said she had been initially nervous about taking on the project. But she added: 'I sat down with Aaron and he said, 'Just do it.'","Director wanted to use jellyfish to portray inner workings of character's mind .

"Liverpool legend Dietmar Hamann has revealed that if he was in charge at the club he would only have signed under-fire striker Mario Balotelli as a last resort in the summer transfer window. Hamann, who last week criticised Balotelli for swapping shirts with Real Madrid’s Pepe at half-time while the Reds were 3-0 down against the Spanish giants, says he would have evaluated every other option available before signing the controversial Italian. In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail at the London Sports Writing Festival he said: ‘I would have taken Balotelli on the last day of the window, but not before. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Mario Balotelli continues to struggle for form in a Liverpool shirt, again firing a blank in the 0-0 draw with Hull . Balotelli courted controversy this week when he swapped shirts with Real Madrid's Pepe at half-time . Liverpool legend Dietmar Hamann says the club should have signed Balotelli only as a last resort . ‘I would have tried to look at every other option which was out there to see if the right player could be found and a deal could be done. ‘And then on the last day if you don’t get anyone and he (Balotelli) is still keen on coming to the club I would have taken him, but I wouldn’t have taken him a week before – that’s for sure. ‘Having said that I’d rather have him at the club than not have him at all, because I think he can produce the moments of magic which can win you games. We just haven’t seen that yet.' Despite his criticism of Balotelli last week, Hamann insists the 24-year-old is being made a scapegoat at Liverpool to disguise their poor form, with the Reds already eight points off leaders Chelsea, having played a game more. He added: ‘He is part of a team that is struggling and is not playing well but all the blame seems to be directed onto him – he’s an easy target. Balotelli tries to beat Hull's James Chester and goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic to the ball . Balotelli appeals in vain for a penalty after colliding with Hull defender Alex Bruce . ‘He is not playing any differently to what he has done in the last five years. You know what you’re getting with Balotelli, and the only difference with him now to previous years is that he’s not scoring. ‘I don’t think he’s as good as people make out but he is a very talented player and could be a success at Liverpool. ‘I’ve been critical of Mario recently (the shirt swapping incident), but I feel the criticism elsewhere has been overboard in particular after the Real Madrid game. ‘He shouldn’t have swapped shirts with Pepe but ultimately it had no bearing on the result and the way Liverpool played. ‘They’ve been under par most of the season and have struggled for results and that isn’t Mario’s fault. He needs support now from everyone at Liverpool because the last thing he needs is people hitting him over the head with a sledgehammer.’","Dietmar Hamann says Liverpool should have only signed out-of-form striker Mario Balotelli if nobody else was available .

"A high school teacher, 41, resigned from his job and left his family so he could move in with a former student, now 18, he is having a relationship with. Enochs Hugh School teacher James Hooker quit his job after going public about his relationship with Jordan Powers from Modesto, California. Police are now investigating to discern whether or not something inappropriate or illegal took place before she turned 18. Since then, the teen's mother has waged a public campaign on Facebook after her daughter moved out of their home. She is alleging Mr Hooker actively pursued her daughter when she was underage and said his actions are tantamount to abuse. Forbidden Love: Jordan Powers, 18, left, is now living with her former teacher James Hooker, 41, right, who she says is 'more than just a lover, but a best friend as well' Where it all began: James Hooker quit his job at Enochs High School in Modesto - where his daughter, 17, is a student and where he met his teenage lover - so he could be with Jordan . The 41-year-old left his wife and children - one of whom is a year younger than Jordan and went to the same school - to move into an apartment with his teenage lover. Mr Hooker was placed on administrative leave on February 3 by Modesto High Schools before resigning a few weeks later. Mother Tammie Powers has launched an aggressive Facebook campaign against Hooker who she calls a 'sick child molester' He taught business and IT as well as running several after-school clubs, one of which Jordan was a member. Speaking to the Sacramento Bee, he said: 'In making our choice, we've hurt a lot of people. We keep asking ourselves, ""Do we make everyone else happy or do we follow our hearts?""' Jordan's mother Tammie Powers is blaming Mr Hooker for pursuing her daughter and taking advantage of her. She claims her daughter's grades fell this year and she started to have panic attacks 'from the stress'. She said Jordan was always a good and 'compliant' daughter. She told The Bee: 'I was really, really careful. I wanted her to be safe. In hindsight, in retrospect, I should have looked at things differently. 'She looked up to him. He was in the position of an educator, you don’t . abuse your student. Period. 'She’s still in high school. She still lives . at home. She has a curfew. That’s not OK.' Jordan has now stopped attending classes at the school and is doing independent study. She and Mr Hooker both maintain they only got together once she turned 18 and their feelings blossomed as they spent time together during and after school. True Love: The couple maintain their feelings for each other blossomed slowly by spending time together during and after school, and then via phone calls and text messages . Love nest: Hooker left his wife and children to move into one of these apartments with Jordan - 23 years his junior . 'He's my best friend', she told ABC. 'I mean, he's more than just a lover.' On Tannie Powers' Facebook account, she posts a picture of James Hooker with this message: . 'This is a picture of JAMES HOOKER from . Enochs High School....a perverted man in his forties, who has taken . advantage of a little girl. 'Now, James if you're reading this while you . have my daughter, you better believe everyone will know you're a sick . child molester. 'Don't . think for one second you will win. I'm smarter, stronger, and . way more determined. I WILL NEVER give up. 'I'll be getting my daughter back you . sicko.' The former teacher said he felt nothing for the teen when she was in his business class. 'She was just a student,' he said. 'There was no attraction. There was nothing that was out of the ordinary, as opposed to any other student.  We were very much a teacher-student role.' Mrs Powers does not believe these claims. She discovered up to 8,000 text messages exchanged between them, emails and late night phone calls. She has now even started a Facebook campaign against Hooker, calling him a 'sicko' and a 'pervert' Mr Hooker said, though he is being investigated, he is confident that he will be cleared of any inappropriate behaviour, but said he can see why people would be alarmed. He told ABC: 'I think the stigma of the teacher-student relationship just makes it messy, makes it really hard for people to get through to the point that we really do like each other. 'We really do want to have a future together.'","He's more than a lover, he's my best friend,' teen insists .

It was unclear why Mr O’Mara, who worked at a web firm, was on the tracks.

Gammon had appeared to dote on the dog during the time they were together, he told the Bristol Evening Post. Roxy originally belonged to a friend but developed anxiety problems after being left alone all day. As Mr Taylor works evening shifts and Gammon worked in the daytime, they thought that between them someone would always be around to look after Roxy, so agreed to adopt her in December 2012. But five months later the couple split up - with Gammon saying she would take on the sole responsibility of looking after Roxy. Mr Taylor says that within a few months, Gammon contacted him to say she was struggling to cope and was looking for a new home for Roxy.

"Lots of acounts, few passwords: New research out on Monday revealed the spiralling number of internet accounts is behind a dramatic rise in online fraud . The average Briton now has 26 online accounts, yet uses just five passwords to keep them secure. Remembering a huge number of different passwords is simply impossible for most of us. But using the same password, for instance, across an email account and an online banking account can leave people terrifyingly vulnerable to hackers. New research out on Monday revealed the spiralling number of internet accounts is behind a dramatic rise in online fraud. Fraudsters in the UK illegally traded more than 12 million pieces of personal information online in the first four months of 2012 alone. Figures from credit checkers Experian says online fraud has increased three fold since 2010, when 9.5 million pieces of information were traded illegally. Online accounts cover everything from banking to utility bills to social networks, with 25 to 34-year-olds signing up to an average 40 accounts. The number is set to grow, with nearly one in five people (17%) signing up to six or more new accounts every month. One in four of the 2,000 people quizzed use a single password for the majority of accounts and one in 20 (four per cent) sticking with the same login details for all their accounts. Experian says people are putting themselves further at risk by no longer using many of their accounts - meaning passwords are not changed regularly. Six in 10 adults (66 per cent) admit to having defunct profiles that hold valuable personal and financial information, including social network profiles (26 per cent), email addresses (18 per cent) and shopping accounts (21 per cent). Peter Turner, managing director at Experian Consumer Services, said: ‘The problem is that most people don't realise there is huge market for login credentials - email and password combinations. ‘These outnumber sales of credit card details by nine to one because they give access to a huge amount of other valuable information, such as address books and related accounts. ‘Using a different password for each account will minimise risks, but if password information is stolen from a website, all accounts using the same details will be compromised, and this information can spread among fraudsters rapidly. ‘Changing passwords after a theft can be like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. Users need to protect themselves with a service like CreditExpert's web monitoring, which will alert them by text or email if details turn up somewhere they shouldn't.’ Two million people said they have been victims of online fraud, leading to debt and refused loans or credit cards.","Rise in e-shopping and banking sites forces net users to reuse passwords .

"Formula One chiefs are proposing a speed limit to slow down cars during dangerous situations on the track, following Jules Bianchi's crash at the Japanese Grand Prix which has left the French driver fighting for his life. Race director Charlie Whiting says it would be best to give teams the ability to cut speed automatically if there is danger on track, rather than leaving it up to the drivers. Whiting presented a report on Bianchi's accident to FIA on Friday and later joined top officials in briefing the media. Formula One driver Jules Bianchi received urgent medical treatment after the crash but remains in hospital . Formula One chiefs are proposing a speed limit to slow down cars during dangerous situations on the track . Race director Charlie Whiting says it would be best to give teams the ability to cut speed automatically . Whiting briefs the media after presenting a report on French driver Bianchi's accident to FIA on Friday . Whiting said Bianchi had slowed down in his Marussia car before skidding off the wet circuit in Suzuka and ploughing into a recovering tractor. But not all drivers had slowed down during a double yellow-flag situation and many did not reduce their speed. Whiting would not say at what speed Bianchi was traveling when he lost control. 'Jules slowed down,' Whiting said, adding that it was a 'matter of degrees' and that more data will have to be studied before his speed could be given with certainty. With international federation president Jean Todt sitting next to him, Whiting showed previously unreleased footage of Bianchi's crash, which shows him driving into the tractor as the marshals had lifted a green flag to signal all clear. Philippe Bianchi, brother Tom, mother Christine, and sister Melanie arrive at the Mie University Hospital . The Bianchi family are pictured outside the hospital. Melanie (left) and Tom (right) arrived there on Thursday . 'Nothing could have been done better,' Whiting said of the reaction to Bianchi's accident. Whiting said he had asked Suzuka organisers to start the race earlier because of heavy rain and fading light but was turned down. He added the time of the start was not a factor in the accident. The planned speed control would enhance a system already available and would, in some situations, replace the safety car, which was not on the track during Bianchi's accident. 'It's probably better to take the decision to slow down away from the drivers,' Whiting said. The aim was to build a 'way to control speed with complete certainty and clarity, with the same effect as a safety car.' Formula One officials were beginning talks with the teams on Saturday, but Whiting said it would be unrealistic to expect any new systems to be in place before the next season.

"Life has not always been easy  for Anne, Britain’s last circus elephant, whose story touched the nation after footage emerged of her being beaten by her groom. But the time has finally come for her to put her feet up – as she retires to a £1.2millon luxury home partly funded by kind-hearted Daily Mail readers. Work is due to begin this month on the enclosure at Longleat Safari Park, which our readers donated more than £350,000 to help build. It should be finished within a year. Footage was handed to the Daily Mail in 2011 of . Anne being beaten by her Romanian keeper. He fled, but Bobby Roberts, . the owner of the circus, was prosecuted for allowing the abuse . The development, to be known as Anne’s Haven, will include under-floor heating, a bathing pool and a four-acre garden. Asian elephant Anne, who is in her sixties, was rescued from the Bobby Roberts Super Circus three years ago after the horrific video of her suffering was passed to the Daily Mail. Nicolai Nitu, the Romanian groom . filmed beating her with a pitchfork, fled after welfare charity Animal . Defenders International released the footage. However, circus boss Bobby . Roberts, from Northamptonshire, was found guilty of animal cruelty in . 2012 after it emerged he kept her constantly chained in her winter . quarters and failed to prevent the abuse. Anne, who is Europe’s oldest elephant, was brought over from Sri Lanka in the 1950s and worked in the circus for 50 years.

Longleat, Wiltshire, she has had physiotherapy for her arthritis and is . now being cared for by three designated keepers, a vet and an osteopath. Longleat’s experts decided that it is best for Anne to live alone for the time being, due to her age and health problems. But the building can house up to four elephants, and the park said it remained open to the possibility of rehoming others in need of rehabilitation.

He had dated Sedwick when they were classmates at Crystal Lake Middle School in Lakeland, Florida, and had known her since she was eight-years-old. After they split up he began dating Shaw - but said she was consumed with jealously because he made no secret of his affection for Rebecca. 'Guadalupe did not like the fact that I still liked Rebecca,' said Borgen, whose cover photo on his Facebook page shows him holding Guadalupe. 'She was angry that I still liked Rebecca and that I'd talk about her. 'It shocked me, it made me mad because she should have just told somebody,' he told WTSP. He said of the tormentors: 'They need to take life seriously. Why do you need to be bullying somebody?' Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said . Tuesday that Shaw allegedly posted this heartless message on Facebook: . 'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but . IDGAF [I don't give a f***].' Sheriff . Judd said that even though Shaw's parents say that she is nice and must . have been hacked since she would never do such a thing, he cannot . believe that they would allow her back online amid the controversy. 'This girl is back on Facebook after Rebecca dying? Can you believe parents would let their child do that?' he said. 'We will not tolerate that. If I can find something to charge her parents with - who are in total denial about this - I will. The apple does not fall far from the tree. 'Rebecca took the bullying to heart and we are not putting up with it. When I stood there at the base of that tower and saw that baby - that child - deceased on the ground it broke my heart and I know it would break the hearts of people all over the country if they were in my position. 'We want to send a message out to kids that anyone who cyber stalks or cyber bullies will be punished.' In the middle: John Borgen previously dated Rebecca and her alleged tormentor Guadalupe Shaw . Devastated: Rebecca Ann Sedwick, 12, pictured with her mother Tricia Norman, is said to have had a disturbing upbringing . Denial: Guadalupe Shaw's parents - who did not want to be pictured - said their daughter was loving and caring and would never write those terrible things . While Shaw's parents are still in denial about their daughter's supposed actions, the parents of the other accused girl- Katelyn Roman- concede that they could have done more. Katelyn's father told ABC: 'I feel horrible for the whole situation. It's my fault that maybe I don't know about that kind of stuff but I wish I did.' One parent who was left reeling even after the arrests was that of Rebecca's mom Tricia as her daughter's 13th birthday would have been this weekend if she had not died last month. After the arrests of her daughter's tormenters were announced, Tricia said: 'I felt like a big weight had been lifted. It was a mixture of tears, relief and sadness. Tragic loss: Rebecca with her sister Amy . Bullied: Rebecca was withdrawn from her . elementary school after being bullied and was home schooled by her mother Tricia (right) who says her daughter's death should be a warning to all parents to be vigilant . Tributes: Flowers, candles and messages are left out in memory of 12-year-old Rebecca . 'Nobody took Rebecca's complaints of . bullying seriously. They just said, ""you need to toughen up - adapt to . new surroundings- develop a thicker skin.""' Judd said they decided to arrest Shaw after she posted the 'reprehensible' message on Saturday. 'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' he said. Roman . was Rebecca's former best friend, but Judd said the 14-year-old turned . her against Rebecca. Other girls also stopped being friends with her in . fear of being bullied, the sheriff said. Missed: Rebecca Sedwick took her own life after being relentlessly bullied . 'Several . students corroborated stories of both girls bullying Sedwick on . different occasions, through name-calling, intimidation, threats to beat . her up, and at least one actual physical fight,' the sheriff said . today. He warned parents in a . news conference yesterday: 'Watch what your children do online. Pay . attention to what your kids are doing. Quit being their best friend and . be their best parent.' Roman . and Shaw were arrested on Monday night and detained at the county's . juvenile center before being released to their parents, the Orlando . Sentinel reports. They were charged with felony aggravated stalking.","Rebecca Sedwick, 12, was bullied online by a gang of up to 15 school girls .

"A Grade II listed hunting lodge favoured by Queen Victoria has gone on the market for the first time in a century. The imposing neo-gothic 19th century New Lodge has a price tag of £15 million and has been converted into offices but estate agent, Savills, hope it will be converted into a family home. The building, in Winkfield, near Windsor, is set in a stunning 55-acre estate that neighbours the ancient parkland of Windsor Great Forest. The hunting lodge that was once a favourite of Queen Victoria has been put on the market for the first time in 100 years . The building has been converted into dozens of offices all with catering and toilet facilities but retaining the stunning features of the building, including a grand staircase with a large stained glass window.

Windsor Castle itself. The stunning building is currently an office conversion featuring around 30 units . It is hoped that the hunting lodge will be restored to its former glory and turning into a family home . ‘It would be wonderful to see it transformed back into a magnificent British home.’ Queen Victoria and her children were regular visitors to the lodge and planted the Wellingtonia trees that line the driveway and it was used in the Second World War as accommodation for refugees. After the war it became a Barnardo’ orphanage before becoming the British Railways School of Transport in the 1950s.

"He's been searching for a 'fox in the box' since the days of Ian Wright and Thierry Henry, and Arsene Wenger thinks he might just have found one in his £16million signing Danny Welbeck. Wenger, who also revealed his preference had been to sign Welbeck on loan from Manchester United rather than permanently, once mistakenly thought Francis Jeffers had fox-like qualities but the in-form England striker might fit the bill. Welbeck is set to make his debut against Manchester City on Saturday, with the Arsenal manager confident he has solved his striking conundrum and given Welbeck an opportunity to finally play his club football in a central position. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsene Wenger and Phil Neville on Danny Welbeck Arsenal transfer . Welbeck enjoys his first training session with his new club alongside Oxlade-Chamberlain at London Colney . Danny Welbeck completed his move from Manchester United to Arsenal on transfer deadline day . Danny Welbeck scored twice to help England to a 2-0 win against Switzerland during the international break . Jeffers (left) was hailed as Wenger's original 'fox in the box' but failed to live up to Henry's standards . ARSENAL suffered their three biggest defeats of last season in 12.45pm games on Saturdays. Will it be the same this time? Dec 14, 2013 6-3 v Man City . Arsenal had only just returned from Italy following a 2-0 defeat at Napoli. Goals from Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Negredo put City 2-1 up at half-time, and Arsenal collapsed after the break to a Fernandinho double and goals from David Silva and Yaya Toure. Feb 8, 2014 5-1 v Liverpool . There were no European excuses when Arsene Wenger's side went to Anfield. They had a clear week to prepare but were caught napping as Liverpool fired in four goals in the first 20 minutes. They never recovered from that blitz and Raheem Sterling completed the rout. Mar 22, 2014 6-0 v Chelsea . A 1-0 win at Tottenham the week before ought to have given Arsenal plenty of confidence but three early goals and Kieran Gibbs's red card for handball, despite Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain committing the offence, led to another long afternoon for Wenger's men. Wenger said: 'He's happy and confident because he scored two goals for England in a very important game (against Switzerland) and that can only boost his confidence. 'When you analyse his game, you think he has the qualities to play through the middle. At United, where you had many big stars, he had to make room for players to play through the middle. But he has the perfect style to play through the middle.' Wenger rather cryptically claimed that nothing would have happened if he had not been on a trip to Rome. He was criticised at the time for being out of the country on September 1 as part of a trip to meet the Pope, but said the journey was important both individually and for the club. 'Meeting the Pope was an experience I did not want to miss,' said Wenger. 'I am a Catholic, so it was an experience, and one (invitation) I accepted a long time ago, and on top of that it was a game for peace and multi-religion understanding. 'I thought today where we are a bit in front of an international religious war, it was a very important game.' Wenger hailed Pope Francis as 'a great person', who met the likes of Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Diego Maradona during the reception at the Vatican. 'He shows humility and is available to meet for everybody, has a word with everybody,' said Wenger. 'He is a supporter of San Lorenzo in Argentina. He is a football fan, you cannot be born in Argentina and not be a football fan. 'He spoke with many Argentinians, so I wanted to be discreet and say 'it was nice to meet you and bye-bye'.' Danny Welbeck is expected to be given more chance to impress in his favourite central role at Arsenal . Danny Welbeck celebrates his second England goal against Switzerland with Rickie Lambert on Monday . Divine intervention is one of many theories put forward for United selling an England striker to a rival, a transfer that stunned Gary Neville among others. Wenger said his first instinct upon learning Radamel Falcao had joined United was to sign Welbeck on loan, with a view to buying him next summer. He muddied the waters by suggesting Welbeck had initially only been available on loan, but it is understood a temporary switch was his preferred option. Wenger held off competition from Tottenham to land the 23-year-old, pulling off a coup in the wake of France striker Olivier Giroud's foot injury and Falcao's loan to United from Monaco. Wenger conducted his business from Italy — a decision he defended by claiming the deal never would have happened if he was in London. 'If I had not travelled that day, Welbeck would not be here,' he said. 'I will tell you that story one day but that's the truth. We are in 2014 and you can always be in touch with everybody even when you travel. The advantage of that day was I had to get up at 6am and I was available the whole day.' When asked if Sir Alex Ferguson would have sanctioned such a deal to a rival, Wenger said: 'You should ask him. I met him by coincidence on Wednesday and I would like to keep that conversation to myself!' Arsenal are sweating on Aaron Ramsey's fitness after he injured an ankle for Wales against Andorra.

"Ministers are working on plans to commemorate the anniversary of the Christmas truce during the First World War with a football match on the battlefields of Flanders. Next Christmas will mark the centenary of when the guns fell silent and British and German troops emerged from the trenches in Belgium and played football in no man's land. The Government is talking to the . Football Association and the National Children's Football Alliance about . how the 1914 matches can be remembered. Scroll down for video . Unarmed: An artist's impression of a football match in no man's land between British and German troops . Defence Minister Andrew Murrison said a . football match was 'a no-brainer in terms of an event that is going to . reach part of the community that perhaps might not get terribly . entrenched into this'. When World War One began in July 1914, many troops were excited to be sent to the front line. People were optimistic that the war would be over promptly and they would be back by Christmas. But within a few months the death toll had reached one million before a single trench had even been dug. The fighting soon ground to a stalemate and the reality of war sunk in. Major JV Bates from the Royal Army Medical Corps wrote: '...the real horror of it came home to us, and if everyone else was as frightened as I was, then we were all petrified.' The fighting lasted for four years, with 16 million troops and civilians losing their lives - one million of them British. Prime Minister David Cameron raised the possibility last year of football matches forming part of an extended series of events to mark the centenaries of key moments during the First World War. Speaking to The Guardian, Dr Murrison indicated that it was an idea was being pursued although planning was still at an early stage and 'discussions are ongoing'. He said: 'I think football has a particular part to play because of the totemic significance of the Christmas truce in 1914. 'We have been in touch with Football Association and the National Children's Football (Alliance) to see how this can be done. 'I know they are enthused and have already clocked the fact that other countries are thinking along similar lines.' He added: 'It is clear the Christmas truce is going to be commemorated in a very significant way. It had no real relevance to the outcome of the war but at that deeply, intensely, personal level, it is something that people really do latch on to.' Remembered: Troops at Dale Barracks in Chester marked a previous anniversary of the Christmas Day truce by playing a football match against German soldiers . The Christmas truce of 1914 was a spontaneous and unofficial laying down of arms across various sectors of the entrenched Western Front. In some areas, soldiers on both sides merely held their fire throughout the day. But in some sectors, troops climbed out of their trenches and made contact with their enemies, some reportedly exchanging gifts and handshakes and playing football. More practically, soldiers used the time to reclaim their dead from no man's land and bury them behind the lines. In the evening, soldiers of both sides sang carols and hostilities were only resumed when fresh battalions were moved into the line, breaking the bonds between the enemies which formed during that day. The Christmas Day truce of 1914 was never repeated during the rest of World War One. VIDEO: .","Government in talks with FA about remembering the no man's land matches .

"An arrest has been made in the mysterious case of a New Hampshire 15-year-old girl who went missing nine months ago and reappared home last week. Nathaniel Kibby, 34, was arrested at his home in Gorham Monday afternoon and charged with the felony kidnapping of Conway teen Abigail Hernandez. The New Hampshire Attorney General's Office said in a press release that Kibby confined Hernandez on October 9, 2013 'with purpose to commit an offense against her.' Scroll down for video . Collared: Nathaniel E Kibby, 34, was arrested Monday in connection to the nine-month disappearance of New Hampshire teen Abigail Hernandez, who reappeared alive in her hometown last week . 'Hernandez provided police with details of her kidnapping sufficient to warrant (the) arrest,' investigators added. Kibby was allegedly arrested without incident and is set to be arraigned in Tuesday at Conway District Court. Neighbor Donald Stgermain, 76, was at home at the time Kibby was arrested and described the scene to MailOnline. Mr Stgermain said he was making food around noon when law enforcement showed up outside his neighbor's house, 'dressed in battle gear with rifles'. He says about an hour later FBI agents showed up at his house, asking if he knew Kibby or had ever seen a young girl near the house. Mr Stgermain said he never had, and never noticed anything strange happening at Kibby's house. Kibby has been living at the residence on Brookside Drive for about five years, Mr Stgermain said. When he moved in he had a girlfriend, but Mr Stgermain says they appeared to have broken up and Kibby has since lived alone. Mr Stgermain's wife has seen Kibby walking a Doberman around the neighborhood on a few occasions. Abigail made headlines last October 9 - . just days before her 15th birthday -  when she unexpectedly disappeared . after last seen by her boyfriend walking home from school. Back home: Abigail Hernandez made headlines last October when she disappeared from her hometown of North Conway, New Hampshire while walking home from school. She reappeared home last week . The . only contact she had with any friends or family was a letter believed . to have been sent by the schoolgirl to her divorced parents, Zenya and . Ruben Hernandez, in the weeks after her disappearance. Then last Sunday, she suddenly reappeared. Kibby's arrest came just hours after Hernandez's mother gave an interview, to speak out against rumors surrounding her daughter's disappearance. In an interview with the Today show, mother Zenya Hernandez shut down speculation that her daughter ran away because she was pregnant. 'The majority of people somehow believe that she was pregnant. She was not. She did not run away. I firmly believe that,' Mrs Hernandez said, adding that she does not believe her daughter knew her alleged abductor. 'She did not run away': Zenya Hernandez spoke with the Today show on Monday to dispell rumors her daughter ran away nine months ago because she was pregnant. Mrs Hernandez says she believes her daughter was abducted . Police have since released a sketch of the man believed to have abducted Abigail, according to the teen's descriptions. However, law enforcement have not released further details of their investigation since her reappearance. ‘Our biggest challenge is, we’re . dealing with incomplete information,’ Kieran Ramsey, assistant special . agent in charge of the Boston Division of the FBI told The Boston Globe. ‘The . victim in this case is a 15-year-old girl. It’s not as cut and dried as . people think that somebody can exactly recount what happened, when, and . where.’ Mrs Hernandez also described the moment her daughter returned home last week, wearing the same clothes as the day she went missing in October 2013. 'We just stood and looked at each other and then we hugged and I just said, ""Thank god you're home, thank god you're home.""' While it was a happy homecoming, Mrs Hernandez was worried by the change in her daughter who had lost a lot of weight and was very pale. 'She had a look in her eyes that I've never ever seen before and that's haunting me,' Mrs Hernandez said. In her interview, Mrs Hernandez vowed to bring her daughter's abductor to justice. 'I feel like they just took and ripped something out of our souls and just as I swore that I'll find her - I'll find the person. I'll find out what happened,' Mrs Hernandez said. Clues: This week police released video of Abby on the day she . disappeared, left, and a sketch of a man they believe drove her away in a . blue pick-up after interviewing Abby for three hours . A missing person poster of Abigail Hernandez displayed in a storefront window in North Conway, N.H., shows Hernandez has been found . On Saturday, authorities released a . sketch of a man, provided to them by Abby, who they believe drove her . away in a blue pick-up back in October. On Friday, the District Attorney's office . revealed that police had received 20 tips from members of the public, . following the release of the sketch. Despite conducting a three-hour . interview with the teen, it is unclear whether they know where she was . or if she was taken by force. They . have also appealed for witnesses who may have seen Abby return after . she was apparently dropped off on the same road that she was possibly . abducted from all those months ago. Sources . close to the investigation said the teenager has so far not been able . to tell officers many facts about her disappearance. But . they are convinced a crime has been committed - as they believe there . is no way the 15-year-old could have stayed hidden for nine months . without some kind of adult involvement. Abigail's reappearance has baffled her North Conway community, including her old boyfriend Jimmy Campbell, 15, and his family who spent a lot of time with the teen before she went missing. Heartbroken: Jimmy Campbell, 15, was left confused when Abigail, his first love, disappeared while walking home from school on October 9 last year ¿ just days before her 15th birthday . So far, they have had little contact with Abigail and her mother, and have received no answers in relation to her nine month absence. 'I have instant messaged Abby’s mother . Zenya, but we have not had any contact. All I want is the truth, I don’t . care what happened, but I want to know who the sons of b*****s were who . had her for nine months,' Jimmy's father James Campbell told MailOnline. Because Abby spent so much time with . Jimmy at the Campbell’s house, the family were questioned by FBI agents . as a matter of course when she first disappeared. Mr Campbell says his family are overjoyed . Abby is home, but he feels the community, who invested so much time and . effort into the search, deserve to know what happened. Zenya Hernandez, center, and her daughter, Sarah Hernandez look at Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young, during a news conference on Friday . 'I . understand the police want to keep the investigation hush hush to an . extent, but they wanted our help when they were looking for her, so how . about giving us some answers now?', he said. Abigail has not spoken publicly about her alleged abduction, but has released a statement thanking those in her community that aided in the search. 'My gratitude is beyond words. It's an incredible feeling to be home and I believe in my heart that your hopes and prayers played a major role in my release,' she said. However, many locals in North Conway feel the same as James Campbell and are still incredibly frustrated by the lack of answers. A number of people posted their views on the Facebook page of The Conway Daily Sun. One, . Jaime McKinnon, wrote: 'Okay... So I hate to be a huge jerk here.. but . seriously. It's like pulling teeth to get any darn info. The entire area . has gone above and beyond to support and help with the search for her. Now she's back and we can't get any darn answers.' Mystery: James Campbell, who says he was close to Abby and her family, has not talked to Abby's mother since she returned. He, like the rest of the town, are left searching for answers over where she has been . Reunion: Ms Smith said she spoke to Zenya this week who told her: 'It's over. The nightmare's over.'

"The elusive 'God particle' discovered by scientists in 2012 has the potential to destroy the universe, Professor Stephen Hawking has warned. At very high energy levels, the Higgs boson could cause space and time suddenly collapse - and 'we wouldn't see it coming', the former Cambridge professor of mathematics says. The God particle, which gives shape and size to everything that exists, could cause a 'catastrophic vacuum delay' if scientists were to put it under extreme stress. Scroll down for video . Stephen Hawking wrote that the recently-found Higgs boson 'God particle' could destroy the universe . The God Particle could destabilise at high energy, threatening the universe, but the Cern particle accelerator is too slow to cause such a problem . A disaster like this is very unlikely for the time being as physicists do not have a particle accelerator large enough create such an experiment, but Prof Hawking's comments have excited scientists, the Sunday Times reported. The theoretical physicist wrote his thoughts on the Higgs boson in the preface to a new book, Starmus, a collection of lectures by scientists and astronomers including Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Queen guitarist Brian May. Prof Hawking wrote: 'The Higgs potential has the worrisome feature that it might become megastable at energies above 100bn giga-electron-volts (GeV). 'This could mean that the universe could undergo catastrophic vacuum decay, with a bubble of the true vacuum expanding at the speed of light. 'This could happen at any time and we wouldn't see it coming.' The theoretical physicist wrote his thoughts on the Higgs boson in the preface to a new book, Starmus, which is released in early November this year . British scientist Peter Higgs predicted the  God Particle in the early 1960s but it was only found in 2012 . The Higgs boson was a key missing piece in the jigsaw for physicists in trying to understand how the universe works. Scientists believe that a fraction of a second after the Big Bang that gave birth to the universe, an invisible energy field, called the Higgs field, formed. This has been described as a kind of ‘cosmic treacle’ across the universe. As particles passed through it, they picked up mass, giving them size and shape and allowing them to form the atoms that make up you, everything around you and everything in the universe. This was the theory proposed in 1964 by former grammar school boy Professor Higgs that has now been confirmed. Without the Higgs field particles would simply whizz around space in the same way as light does. A boson is a type of sub-atomic particle. Every energy field has a specific particle that governs its interaction with what’s around it. The professor did add sarcastically, however, that such an event is unlikely in the near future. He said: 'A particle accelerator that reaches 100bn GeV would be larger than Earth, and is unlikely to be funded in the present economic climate.' Professor John Ellis, a theoretical physicist at Cern, said: 'One thing should be made clear. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) did not cause this problem, and collisions at the LHC could not trigger the instability, because their energies are far too low.' Particle accelerators make subatomic particles travel at greater and greater speeds as they are pumped with more energy before smashing them together. Scientists do this to try and spot tiny fragments of particles which fly off, and it is how the Higgs boson was discovered at the Cern LHC in Switzerland in 2012. In that experiment, physicists noticed unexpected debris from the collisions that fitted with what British scientist Peter Higgs had predicted in the early 1960s. The Higgs boson particle is thought to be part of the mechanism that gives matter its mass, but scientists do not fully understand it yet.

"A male friend of the Indian gang-rape victim who was with her when she was attacked has described how he had to carry her bleeding body into a police van on his own - because none of the officers wanted to touch her. The 28-year-old said no passersby stopped to help them as they lay naked and bleeding in the road after they were thrown off a Delhi bus on which the gruesome ordeal occurred on December 16. When the police finally arrived they wasted two hours arguing over which police station was responsible before finally taking the victims to a hospital which wasn't close to the crime scene, he said. Claims: Awindra Pandey, the male friend with Miss Singh Pandey when she was subjected to the brutal gang-rape ordeal, spoke out in an interview on Indian television . Treatment: The rape victim was taken to intensive care at a Singapore hospital but died of her injuries . Police in India today denied the man's claims. The 23-year-old woman died on December 29 in a specialist hospital in Singapore after a 13-day struggle to survive injuries so grievous that her intestines had to be removed. She underwent three major surgeries and suffered a cardiac arrest in India before being flown to Singapore for treatment. The horrifying crime has appalled India and brought simmering anger about widespread crime against women to the boil amid angry calls for safer streets, more sensitive policing and changed social attitudes. In an interview with Hindi TV channel . Zee News, the victim's friend said the gang of six men aboard the bus - fitted with . curtains and tinted windows - had planned to trap them. Once on the bus, he was attacked and his . 23-year-old friend was gang-raped by a group of allegedly drunk . men, including the driver, who also violated her with an iron bar . causing immense internal damage that led to her death. The man, believed to be the only witness in the case, said he did his best to fight off the attackers. 'They . beat us up, hit us with iron rod, snatched our clothes and belongings . and they threw us off the bus on a deserted stretch. 'From where we boarded bus, they moved around for nearly two and a half hours. We were shouting, trying to make people hear us,' said the 28-year-old, who suffered a broken leg in the attack. 'But . they switched off the lights. We tried to resist them. Even my friend . fought with them, she tried to save me. She tried to dial police control . room number 100, but the men snatched the mobile.' Police officer Vivek Gogia has denied claims that officers debated for half an hour before taking the rape victim and her friend to a hospital. In a statement, Gogia said police vans reached the spot where the rape victim and her friend were dumped within three minutes of receiving the alert. 'Police vans left the spot for hospital with the victims within 12 minutes,' the officer said. That time was spent borrowing bed sheets from a neighboring hotel to cover the naked rape victim and her friend, he said. Indian police personnel stand guard outside the district court Saket in New Delhi after fears of mob violence against the suspects . Public interest: Indian citizens queue to enter the Saket district court in New Delhi - where two of the five men accused of raping Miss Singh Pandey today begged to be allowed to turn witness for the prosecution . The friend of the rape victim made the comments after her alleged killers were kept away from court on Thursday amid fears of mob violence. 'After throwing us off the bus, they tried to mow us down, but I saved my friend by pulling her away in the nick of time. 'We . were without clothes. We tried to stop people passing by. Several auto . rickshaws, cars and bikes slowed down but no one stopped for about 25 . minutes. 'Then someone on patrol stopped and called the police,' he told Zee News. He claimed three police vans arrived at the scene after about 45 minutes, . but wasted time in deciding under which police station’s jurisdiction . the case fell. He alleged nobody, including the police, gave them clothes or called an ambulance. 'They . were just watching us,' he said, adding someone gave them a part of bed . sheet to cover his friend after repeated requests. 'My . friend was bleeding profusely. But instead of taking us to a nearby . hospital, they (police) took us to a far away hospital.' Anger: India lawyers participate in a protest outside Indian Saket District Court . He said he carried his badly injured friend to the PCR van on his own as . the policemen didn’t help them because the girl was bleeding profusely. 'Nobody . from the public helped us. People were probably afraid that if they . help us they would become witness to the crime and would be asked to . come to police stations and courts,' he told the channel. 'Even . at the hospital we were made to wait and I had to literally beg for . clothes. I borrowed a stranger’s mobile and called my relatives, but . just told them that I met with an accident. My treatment started only . after my relatives came,' he said. 'I . was hit on the head. I was not able to walk. I was not able to move my . hands for two weeks,' he said, detailing the injuries he suffered . on that horrific night. Five people have been formally charged over the rape and murder of the student paramedic, with one named as Ram Singh. It has emerged that a sixth suspect, . who is believed to be a juvenile and is expected to be tried . separately, was the cruelest of all. Indian TV station NDTV has shown footage understood to be the suspects charged in the gang-rape case . According to The Hindustan Times, a . police charge sheet reveals in horrendous detail exactly what he is . alleged to have done to the unconscious victim - after she had been . raped. The newspaper reported that he pulled her intestines out with his bare hands and was also responsible for suggesting that she be thrown naked from the bus. Yesterday, her father called for the hanging . of those responsible for the attack saying 'the death penalty is . compulsory for a crime so great.' The trial will be held in a fast track court. 'Of all the persons in the bus, two . had engaged in the most barbarism - Ram Singh, the main accused in the . case, and the juvenile ' said an officer according to the paper. 'Both of them had subjected her to . sexual abuse twice. Singh was the first to rape her followed by the . juvenile and then Akshay. Later, when she lost consciousness, Singh and . the juvenile raped her a second time.' Authorities . are waiting for the outcome of a bone marrow test before deciding . whether the sixth suspect in the attack will be charged as a juvenile or . an adult. Calls for hanging: In an interview the victim's father said 'The death penalty is compulsory for a crime so great - the assailants must be hanged' The results of the test, intended to determine the suspect's exact age, are expected to arrive soon. The other five men are expected to appear in court on Monday for pre-trial proceedings. Police plan to ask for the death penalty in the case. The men - the bus driver, his brother . and four of their friends - are residents of a south Delhi slum near . the site of the attack. Indian Chief Justice Altamas Kabir . said the accused should be tried swiftly, but cautioned that they needed . to be given a fair trial and not subjected to mob justice. 'Let us not lose sight of the fact . that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty,' he said . yesterday, while inaugurating the new fast-track court. Criminal lawyer Ajay Digpaul told India . Today: 'In my view, it should not take more than 10-15 effective . hearings to decide the case it as there is plenty of evidence.' Sanjay Kumar, a lawyer and a member of the Saket District Bar . Council said that 2,500 advocates registered at the court had decided to stay away to ensure 'speedy justice'. 'We have decided that no lawyer will . stand up to defend the rape accused as it would be immoral to defend the . case,' he said to AFP. The government is to set up four . other such courts in the capital to hold timely trials in sexual assault . cases, which often get bogged down for years in India's notoriously . sluggish court system. Women's activists hope the rape and . killing of the university student on December 16 will mark a turning . point in India's behavior towards women. Poignant: White lilies could be seen in the back of the ambulance as the body was transported through the city . Yesterday the father of the . physiotherapy student paid tribute to his 'fiercely determined' daughter . in his first interview since the attack happened. In an interview with the BBC the day . after he scattered his daughter's ashes on the sacred waters of the . River Ganges, her father revealed how his daughter wanted to be a doctor . and had promised to lift the family from their poverty. He said: 'She was very adamant about whatever she wanted. 'When . we used to stop at a sweetshop on the way to school she was adamant . about wanting a sweet and even the shopkeeper had to relent. 'It . was the same in high school. She wanted to be a doctor and said it was . only a matter of a few years and that when she was a doctor (all our . suffering) it will end.' 'I remember asking her once, who are all your friends? She replied, Dad it's only my books I am friends with.' Her . father moved the family to Delhi from a rural part of India in order to . improve her chances of realising her ambition of a career in medicine.

"John Balyo, 35, (pictured at his arrest last week) a former DJ for Christian station WCSG, was charged with having sex with a minor. FBI revealed today they found his storage unit containing handcuffs and duct tape . A Christian radio host has admitted to raping a 12-year-old boy, a prosecutors said on Monday. John Balyo, 35, was arrested last Friday while at the Big Ticket Christian music festival in Gaylord, Michigan. He was a morning show host on Christian station WCSG. The 35-year-old admitted to raping the child, a Calhoun County prosecutor said at Balyo's arraignment on Monday. The accused, of Caledonia, Michigan, was denied bail after being charged with first- and second-degree criminal sexual conduct.  He is now facing the rest of his life in prison. Balyo got married in April and has a stepson, according to the Christian Post. According to Mlive.com, prosecutor . David Gilbert said Balyo admitted to 'some' charges which police said . related to a single incident at a home in Battle Creek on May 17. The . DJ allegedly paid resident Ronald Moser, 41, to have sex with a young boy. Authorities who raided Moser's property on June 5 found him at the home with a 12-year-old boy. According to mlive.com, in a photo album allegedly posted online by Moser, there were ten images of a young boy lying face down on a bed. His hands and feet were bound and he was wearing only underwear, which had been rolled up to show his buttocks, according to a federal agent. The albums had titles such as 'very cute boy,' and 'sexy boys', police said. The FBI said Moser put images online and planned to trade in child . porn.  It is alleged that Moser ran a website providing sex with underage boys for money. The investigation into the alleged pedophiles has involved multiple agencies as part of a larger 'Operation Predator'. Balyo was fired from his job at WCSG and the station publicly asked for prayers for the former host, his family and alleged victims. The 35-year-old had been at the radio station for eight years.

"The Japanese Grand Prix  top 10 in Suzuka as shown by our live leaderboard . It was one of Lewis Hamilton’s stellar drives, the kind that lifts people off their seats to marvel at what sport at its best is all about. He was brave and relentless and skilled in a rain-splattered Japanese Grand Prix, seizing one of the finer of his 30 race victories by hunting down and passing his championship rival Nico Rosberg. But within minutes of the win, his face was sombre, his words grave, as he waited in the ante-room ahead of the podium ceremony. Rosberg had just whispered in his team-mate’s ear the news that Jules Bianchi of Marussia had been seriously injured. Although the seriousness of Bianchi’s condition was not entirely known, the podium men — Hamilton, runner-up Rosberg and third-placed Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull — refrained from spraying the champagne. In the fading light of a drab, sodden day, even Hamilton’s pyrotechnical driving had found sombre context. The whole benighted weekend had been beset by talk of the incoming weather — a super-typhoon called Phanfone. Would it tip an oceanful of water over the track at 3pm local time, the scheduled start of the race? The rain was incessant but only pitter-pattering down all day. As the cars were driven from the garage to the grid only Sergio Perez slipped off the track; the rest got round easily enough. As they waited to start, the rain markedly intensified. The teams prepared their cars under gazebos, turning the grid into a tented village. Puddles glistened even in the gloom. Rivulets ran across the track. Fans in ponchos were soaked to the marrow. Lewis Hamilton recorded his third straight win after winning a rain-affected Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka . Jules Bianchi was taken to hospital after crashing into a recovery vehicle that was removing Adrian Sutil's stranded Sauber . Bianchi was taken to hospital in an ambulance after being left unconcious following his crash at Suzuka . Bianchi's Marussia crashed into the recovery vehicle that was removing Sutil's stranded Sauber . 1. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) - 266 . 2. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) - 256 . 3. Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) - 196 . 4. Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) - 136 . 5. Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) - 133 . So the race started behind the safety car. It was a reasonable decision but even at this stately pace, Marcus Ericsson’s Caterham slid off. Hamilton came on to the radio to ask the team to tell Rosberg not to stop suddenly, so poor was the visibility. Perhaps rather cautiously, race director Charlie Whiting called for a red flag after only two laps. There was a 20-minute delay during which the Ferris wheel next to the track was the only wheel that turned. The race finally restarted, again behind the safety car. Hamilton was not keen on this artificial brake racing. In increasingly exasperated tones, he made it clear he thought conditions sufficiently good to take the safety car away. ‘Charlie, the track is fine,’ he said, addressing Whiting directly. Hamilton’s almost self-destructive blindness to danger is one of his finest traits as a sportsman. Not everybody agreed with his gung-ho promptings. Felipe Massa of Williams complained animatedly that the conditions were unsafe. Whiting waited a little longer before withdrawing the safety car. Now Hamilton was a dog off his lead. Ahead of him was Rosberg, who took pole position brilliantly in the dry on Saturday but was now being harried every lap by the other Mercedes. So it was no surprise when Hamilton passed him by coming out of the final chicane on lap 29 more cleanly, closing on his quarry on the straight and going round him on the outside of the first corner. It was clean, hard racing. There was no reprise of the Senna-Prost chicanery. ‘I was pushing to get by Nico,’ said Hamilton. ‘I had the DRS (overtaking device) open and I forgot to take it off. When I went into the corner the rear end stepped out. It was very, very close but I saved it.’ Paramedics and marshals attend to Bianchi after his Marussia crashed into a recovery vehicle towards the end of the race in Japan . Sutil, who spun off at the Dunlop Curve, looks distressed as he talks to medical staff following Bianchi's crash . Bianchi was rushed away in an ambulance and was unconscious after his crash with a recovery vehicle at Suzuka . Once he was ahead, he simply blitzed away to open up a 10-point gap at the top of the world championship standings with four races remaining. He takes the momentum of three victories on the bounce into next Sunday’s inaugural Russian Grand Prix, although the absurdity of double scoring at the final race in Abu Dhabi renders his advantage less significant than it should be. The race was brought to a premature end when Bianchi slid off as he exited Dunlop, the long left-hander seventh corner, and hit the crane that was trying to lift Adrian Sutil’s Sauber off the track. A safety car was deployed before the rising concern over his condition — and possibly the worsening light — caused the race to be brought to an end six laps early. The conditions were bad, but the typhoon stayed away. An honourable mention should go to Jenson Button, the supreme tactician, who was first in for intermediate tyres after the restart and finished an impressive fifth for McLaren. It was a timely reminder of the Briton’s ageless skills, with Fernando Alonso linked with his seat if, as expected, the Spaniard leaves Ferrari to be replaced by Vettel, who announced this weekend that he is moving from Red Bull. However, Alonso, it seems, may instead opt for a year out of the sport. His race ended after three laps with a suspected electrical failure. He was taken back to the garage on a scooter and threw his hands up in a resigned shrug. VIDEO Hamilton claims dramatic Japan GP .

"Eliaquim Mangala's £32million transfer fee to Manchester City squeezes him between Barcelona's Dani Alves, at £31m, and former Juventus full-back Lilliam Thuram, who moved there for £36.5m, in the most expensive ever defenders list. On current form for his new club, he would be more suitably positioned between a pair of unknown Sunday League defenders. 'Where did they sign him from?' one spectator at the Boleyn Ground asked. It was pointed out he came from Porto. 'I hope they kept the receipt.' Elaquim Mangala was poor against West Ham on Saturday and has not impressed in his seven games for City . The Manchester City centre back (right) is beaten to the ball by West Ham striker Carlton Cole (left) Mangala (left) is challenged in the air by West Ham's on-loan defender Carl Jenkinson (centre) Mangala struggled to deal with the likes of Cole (left) and had an especially torrid time against Diafra Sakho . The defender moved to Manchester City for £32million in August, signing a five-year-deal with the Blues . Mangala (left) appeals before Sakho's match-winning header was deemed to have crossed the line . What City manager Manuel saw in the player when he signed him in the summer is a mystery, at the moment. 9 min - Almost scuffs a clearance over Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart . 18 min - Easily beaten to a long-ball by West Ham striker Diafra Sakho, which lead to a chance for the home side . 19 min - Sakho steals the ball from the City defender near his own box on the right . 41 min - Leaves Enner Valencia unmarked in the City, but misses to the left . 42 min - Fails to clear the ball and loses posession to Sakho yet again . He was a constant liability at the back for City against West Ham. This is not the first nightmare afternoon he has had, in only seven games. Against Hull, last month, he conceded a penalty and scored an own goal. Fortunately on that day his team-mates managed to score four so he got away with it. That was not the case this time. From as early as the ninth minute it started going wrong, when he was facing his own goal and thrashed a leg at the ball sending the clearance looping over Joe Hart and heading in, only for the goalkeeper to push it over. Ten minutes later and Hart saved him again. Diafra Sakho all too easily beat Mangala to a long-range free kick sent into the box and his cushion header played in Enner Valencia, who was only denied by Hart from point-blank range. The same happened again in the second half – another ball booted high and long which the centre-back took time to position himself under and jump for the header, only for Sakho to beat him again. Nothing came from it on this occasion. On 19 minutes he was at fault again. This time Mangala had his pocket picked by Sakho near his own box on the right. Vincent Kompany eventually rushed back to clear, while tumbling, when the ball was crossed into the box. He must've been wondering how much more covering he had to do. Against Hull, Mangala conceded a penalty and scored an own goal in City's 4-2 victory at the KC stadium . The defender was in the French international squad for this summer's World Cup in Brazil but didn't feature . Just before half-time, he knew for sure. A low ball was played into the box and Valencia, completely free, took a touch before shooting narrowly passed the left post. Kompany pointed at the space and looked over at his defensive partner, questioning why so much was allowed. And it was heart-in-mouth stuff a minute later when he failed to clear the ball and Sakho got possession of it instead. In his defence, he hustled the player across the pitch to win the ball back. There was a moment of promise, midway through the second half, when he dived back, at full stretch, to intercept a rapid West Ham break to stop what would have been a certain goal. That is by no means £32m defending, though. Premier League 2014/15 . Appearances: 4 . Minutes on pitch: 360 . Total tackles made: 11 . Tackles won: 72.7% . Shots blocked: 1 . Interceptions: 6 .

"When Matthew Crawley got down on one knee before Lady Mary in the Christmas snow outside Downton Abbey, it seemed to be the quintessential fairytale proposal. And now one lucky super-fan of the TV series has had her own fairytale come true, after her clever boyfriend popped the question in exactly the same spot. Emma Harris, 30, was delighted when her boyfriend Andy Chapman, 38, asked her to marry him in the setting for her favourite ITV drama - Highclere Castle in Hampshire -  pretending to be Matthew Crawley to her Lady Mary. Downton one knee: Andy Chapman, 38, proposed to girlfriend Emma Harris, 30, during a tour of Highclere Castle in Hampshire, where her favourite TV show - ITV period drama Downton Abbey - is filmed . Miss Harris, who lives in Upnor in Kent, became the future Mrs Chapman during a surprise day out in the grounds of the stately home - the fictional estate of the Earl of Grantham and his family - on a fundraising tour organised by the charity Young Epilepsy. The surprise began when she turned up at work at 9am that morning and found Mr Chapman waiting for her in the office, ready to whisk her off to Hampshire. Originally thinking the day out was the whole surprise, Miss Harris was shocked when during the tour her boyfriend got down on one knee and asked her to marry him, just as Matthew Crawley (played by Dan Stevens) had to Lady Mary Crawley (played by Michelle Dockery) in the series.

"England stalwart Peter Reid has called upon Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson to be given the key role of becoming Roy Hodgon’s long-term holding midfielder – rather than Jack Wilshere. Reid believes finding the right “destroyer” is the biggest question left for Hodgson after the 2-0 win in Switzerland. Man in the middle: Jordan Henderson should be England's holding midfielder, according to Peter Reid . Shadow: Henderson keeps tabs on Switzerland's Admir Mehmedi on Monday night . He admitted: ‘I am not sure about Wilshere in the holding midfield role. 'We have good forward players like Ross Barkley and Adam Lallana to come back but at the other end, when Phil Jones lost the ball at 0-0, if we were against top quality opposition, we would have been 1-0 down. ‘That extra defensive shield is my one area of concern but we have time to improve on that.

"Cristiano Ronaldo’s social life may now be focus of more speculation than the footballing future of Lionel Messi, but make no mistake – Saturday’s rush of blood to the head was all about football and had nothing to do with the Real Madrid star's life off the pitch. The best evidence of that came as he walked off the pitch at Cordoba’s Archangel stadium on Saturday brushing the dust from the World Club Champions badge on his Real Madrid shirt. His supporters will say it was an act of defiance. His critics will say it was one of arrogance but neither will argue it wasn’t rooted firmly in football which is all Ronaldo cares about from the moment he steps off the team coach to the moment he gets back on it. Cristiano Ronaldo lashes out at Cordoba defender Edimar while Real Madrid were chasing a late winner . The Real Madrid superstar's customised CR7 boot clearly makes contact with the defender's leg . Ronaldo appears to claim there is nothing wrong as the defender goes down shamefully clutching his face . Ronaldo is reportedly dating  TV presenter Lucia Villalon (right) after his split from Irina Shayk (left) The split with Russian model Irina Shayk and speculation that Ronaldo is now dating Real Madrid TV presenter Lucia Villalon will have been a million miles from his mind when he hit-out at Jose Crespo. Elma Aveiro, speaking to Portuguese media Correjo de Manha, talks about the family’s hope that he finds a woman who ‘loves and respects him’ and who also denied the link to Villalon, will not have been what was troubling him as kicked Edimar with eight minutes left of Real Madrid’s hard-fought win over Cordoba. When football’s most focused player loses it, it is only ever about the game. It was the fifth red card of his six-year career in Spain and much like the one 13 months ago against Athletic Bilbao it will have been born out of frustration at perceived lack of refereeing protection and perhaps even more importantly at the ineptitude of Real Madrid’s performance against inferior but supremely motivated opposition. Surprise surprise Ronaldo hates not winning. He was frustrated. He has scored against 27 of the 29 teams he has faced in Spain. Cordoba, along with Real Sociedad are the only one to have resisted him. Marca match reporter Santiago Segurola called it ‘his worst game since signing in 2009’ and while that might have been stretching it, the performance was summed up by the degree to which Bebe was overshadowing him on the other side by showing all the pace and flair that made Manchester United gamble on his signing, as well as all the misplaced crossing and shooting that helped ensure he was never a success at Old Trafford. Bebe overshadowed fellow former Manchester United player winger during the La Liga clash . Manchester United flop Bebe, pictured with Marcelo, impressed against Real Madrid . Bebe attempts to win back possession from Real Madrid right back Dani Carvajal . Ronaldo and Madrid also felt aggrieved by the match referee who gave a first minute penalty when Bebe’s shot hit Sergio Ramos thigh and cannoned up on to his arm making it completely accidental. Ramos himself should have been given a penalty shortly after when Crespo held him down in the area. The same player could be seen holding Ronaldo at various set-plays and it is he who received the first of Ronaldo’s right-handers – the one the referee doesn’t spot. Edimar, who was kicked by Ronaldo for the sending off said after the game, said: ‘He had become a bit hot-headed because things were not working out for him. 'Things were not going right for the team and he had become a bit nervous because he wasn’t able to do what he normally does. He crossed the line but it's gone and forgotten. I hope he gets just a normal ban and nothing more.’ What is 'normal' will be decided by Spanish football's disciplinary committee who usually sit on Tuesday. The referee’s report does not mention him striking Crespo in the face after the kick and neither does it call the incident 'violent conduct' so a two-game ban is most likely. Ronaldo raises his arm as Cordoba defender Jose Angel Crespo moves closer following his kick at Edimar . The committee could ask Mr Alejandro Hernandez Hernandez to 'elaborate' on his brief summary of the incident and if he chooses to include the slap on Crespo then the ban could run to three games. If that sounds a bit amateur-hour bear in mind a year ago the referee actually changed his report post-match. First he said he had sent Ronaldo off for striking Carlos Gurpegui then he said it was because he had hit out at Ander Iturraspe. So it is possible the referee could add some misdemeanours to the list which would make for a longer ban. If Ronaldo is given a three-match ban it will include Real Madrid’s trip to the Vicente Calderon in the league to play Atletico Madrid. Real will need their talisman there more than ever. Could the player’s moment of madness actually cost them the title? Ronaldo will be reflecting on that on Sunday morning. But no one at Madrid will be turning the drama into a crisis. Gareth Bale has already said: ‘The team has shown it can cope without certain key players, even when we have been without him [Ronaldo].’ Carlo Ancelotti actually congratulated Cordoba for their performance, saying they made Madrid 'suffer'. No one was suffering more than Ronaldo and he reacted, as he has done before - four times before - with some costly petulance. In a final act of petulance, Ronaldo takes a backhand swipe at  Crespo before being shown the red card .

"A woman was shot by her ex-boyfriend after he came looking for her while she was working as a parking attendant at a baseball stadium. Though the woman has not been identified, the shooter's name is Marcus Collins and he proceeded to kill himself after firing several shots at his ex-girlfriend as she approached by foot. The woman, 41, was hit at least once in the abdomen after she walked up to Collins' silver Cadillac. Scene: The woman took a golf cart towards Marcus Collin's car before approaching by foot. He then fired several shots at her and then shot and killed himself inside the silver Cadillac . The Kansas City Star reports that she lost her spleen, kidney, and portions of both her liver and pancreas due to the shooting, but she is expected to survive. However, police have not been able to interview her to learn more about her relationship with Collins due to her injuries. As the woman was running away, Collins proceeded to shoot and kill himself. Police told the paper that Collins, who lived in Raytown, Missouri, knew the woman for nearly two decades but they had only recently started dating. That said, his family had never heard of her, and her family had never met Collins, implying that the relationship was not serious. On with the game: The shooting took place Friday afternoon in the Kauffman Stadium (pictured) parking lot just hours before the Kansas City Royals played the Los Angeles Angels . The incident took place at 3.20pm on Friday in a parking lot between Arrowhead Stadium, home to the Kansas City Chiefs football team, and Kauffman Stadium, home to the Kansas City Royals baseball team. The Royals played the Los Angeles Angels at home just hours later and the shooting did not disrupt the scheduled game.

"Even Steve Jobs worried about the effects of exposing children to technology. The late Apple co-founder didn't allow his children to spend too much time with the shiny gadgets he created — and even as the iPad roared into success in 2010, his youngest daughters didn't even have one. 'They haven’t used it,' Jobs told the New York Times back in 2010, the year the first-generation tablet came out, as recalled this week by Times columnist Nick Bilton. 'We limit how much technology our kids use at home.' Tech parents: Steve Jobs and wife Laurene Powell limited how much their young daughters, Erin and Eve, were exposed to technology. At the Jobs home, the girls weren't even allowed to have an iPad . Jobs had three children with wife Laurene Powell: a boy, 23-year-old Reed, and girls Erin, 19, and Eve, 16. He also has an older daughter, Lisa Brenna-Jobs, 36, with his first serious girlfriend, Bay Area painter Chris-Ann Brennan. His youngest girls, Erin and Eve, were about 12 and 15 when the iPad came out. 'Every evening Steve made a point of having dinner at the big long table . in their kitchen, discussing books and history and a variety of . things,' biographer Walter Isaacson, who wrote 'Steve Jobs,' told the Times. 'No one ever pulled out an iPad or computer. The kids . did not seem addicted at all to devices.' Jobs, who died in October 2011, was not alone: a number of executives limit how much they expose their children to the very technology they produce or sell to put food on the table. 'My kids accuse me and my wife of being . fascists and overly concerned about tech, and they say that none of . their friends have the same rules,' CEO Chris Anderson, of drone maker 3D Robotics, told the Times. Anderson, who has five children between ages 6 to 17, has a clear reason for now allowing his kids too much screen time. 'That’s because we have seen the dangers of technology firsthand,' he told the Times. 'I’ve seen it in myself, I don’t want to see that happen to my kids.' Some techie parents disagree. Ali Partovi, who advises tech giants such as Facebook and Dropbox, says he differentiates times when hils children use the computer as a tool of creation from times when they're just playing games or wasting time. 'Just as I wouldn’t dream of limiting how much time a kid can spend with her paintbrushes, or playing her piano, or writing, I think it’s absurd to limit her time spent creating computer art, editing video, or computer programming,' Partovi told the Times.","The Apple co-founder and wife Laurene Powell were strict about how much their young daughters, Erin and Eve, got to be in front of a screen .

"A bidding war between sportswear giants Nike and adidas is set to push the value of Manchester United’s next kit deal beyond the £70m-a-year mark, it emerged on Tuesday evening. Just a day after Arsenal signed a British record deal with Puma of £35m-a-year, Sportsmail can reveal that the battle for United’s next kit reached fever pitch this week with rival companies adidas, Warrior and Puma all attending meetings with commercial director Richard Arnold to pitch for the deal. United’s current suppliers Nike are favourites to renew the present contract that runs at £23.5m-a-year and expires in 2015.

It . is understood that United and Nike have had some serious disagreements . over the way a new contract would be structured in the last two weeks . and it is this that has opened the door for adidas and others.

"Nathaniel Clyne appears in no rush to sign the contract extension offered to him by Southampton. Since arriving from Crystal Palace in 2012, the 23-year-old has improved markedly and subsequently broken into the England set-up. Such performances have led to understandable interest from a number of clubs, with Manchester United strongly reported to be one of the vultures circling over St Mary's. Nathaniel Clyne (left) challenges Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha for possession at St Mary's Stadium . Ronald Koeman is relaxed about Clyne's future, although suggested last week that he would like to know by April whether he will be signing the contract extension on the table - a schedule the right-back is happy to stick to. 'My contract, we're still negotiating,' said Clyne, whose current deal expires in summer 2016. 'I'm negotiating with my agent and also with the club so, yeah, we'll wait until April.' Clyne's decision could be a whole lot easier then if Saints' march towards the Champions League is still on track. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman wants to know by April whether Clyne will sign a contract extension . While Saturday's FA Cup fourth-round defeat to his former club was disappointing, this still looks like being a season to remember given Koeman's men sit third in the Barclays Premier League after 22 matches. It is a remarkable feat considering the doom and gloom which followed the summer talent drain from St Mary's, and Clyne believes they can continue their a top-four tilt. 'Definitely, we're optimistic,' he said. 'We have got a good side. 'We know that we can continue the league form, the good run of form that we're in.

"Sergio Aguero was lucky to stay on the pitch against West Ham on Saturday during a game in which Sam Allardyce's side marshalled the Manchester City striker with relative ease. West Ham duo Winston Reid and James Collins were able to deal with everything that was thrown at them - with Aguero forced into feeding off scraps during the Premier League encounter. And the Argentina international should have been sent for an early bath for a studs-up challenge on Mark Noble.

Shooting accuracy: 65% . Chance conversion: 26% . Blocked shots: 9 . Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . Aguero looked lively during the opening minutes as the 26-year-old tried to test Hammers stopper Adrian. His effort flashed just wide of the goal but his attempt sent a warning to West Ham's defence -  they had to keep a close eye on the Premier League's joint-leading scorer. West Ham's rearguard were forced into stopping Aguero's typically mazy runs on two occasions by simply hacking the striker down on the edge of the box. Yaya Toure was handed the responsibility of taking the subsequent free-kicks but his attempts did not trouble Adrian. His link-up play with David Silva was particularly impressive but he was not allowed the time and space to test West Ham's Spanish keeper. Aguero, who cut a frustrated figure during the first half, should not have even appeared back on the Upton Park turf after the interval as the former Atletico Madrid man swiped at the legs of Noble on the stroke of half-time. Manuel Pellegrini brought on Stevan Jovetic for Edin Dzeko to try to get the best out of his star forward and the substitution seemed to have an immediate effect on City's forward play. Aguero had the perfect opportunity to put City on level terms in the 65th minute when he was played in by Jesus Navas but his shot from close range smashed against the bar. Silva stepped up to the plate after West Ham had doubled their advantage by twisting and turning inside the area before curling the ball past Adrian but the champions were unable to find the equaliser.

"A Hillsborough style investigation will probe the suspicious deaths of 92 pensioners at a hospital unit accused of 'routinely' administering morphine to elderly patients. The two-year inquiry will focus on the Gosport War Memorial in Hampshire which had higher than expected death rates of elderly patients between 1988 and 2000. Care Minister Norman Lamb announced the investigation yesterday appointing  former Bishop of Liverpool  James Jones to head the inquiry. Gillian MacKenizie, pictured, welcomed the new independent inquiry which will examine the treatment her mother Gladys Richards received at the Gosport War Memorial Hospital before her death in 1998 . The independent inquiry into the Gosport War Memorial Hospital in Hampshire, pictured, is expected to take two years and will probe the suspicious deaths of 92 elderly patients who died between 1988 and 2000 . A police review into a number of the deaths did not provide enough evidence for prosecution, however and earlier review of clinical practice at the hospital criticised the routine use of opiates while treating elderly patients. Minister Lamb said: 'Following the publication of the Baker Report in August 2013 into higher than expected death rates of elderly patients at Gosport War Memorial Hospital between 1988 and 2000, families have continued to raise concerns about the initial care of their relatives and the subsequent investigations into their deaths. 'In order to try and address their concerns, and having given consideration to a number of alternative options, I am setting up an independent panel to review the documentary evidence held across a range of organisations. 'I have asked Bishop James Jones to chair the panel. Having successfully steered the Hillsborough panel, he brings a wealth of expertise and experience to this work. He has begun to work with affected families, and will continue to do so over the coming weeks and months to ensure that the views of those most affected by these deaths are taken into account.' Gillian MacKenzie, whose mother Gladys Richards, 91, died at the hospital in 1998 after a routine hip opeation welcomed the probe. She told The Mirror: 'I am very happy there is finally to be a full inquiry, but I will be unhappy if it is contained simply to the hospital as there are far wider ramifications involving the police and the General Medical Council. 'It's frustrating that there has never been a criminal prosecution. I want to know why not.' The terms of reference of the investigation will be announced in the Autumn. Prof James Baker's earlier review of the hospital's clinical practice found that the 'almost routine use of opiates' for elderly patients 'almost certainly had shortened the lives of some patients'. Prof Baker said a number of those patients could have reasonably expected to make a full recovery. Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb, right, announced the independent inquiry into the hospital. Dr Jane Barton, left, was found guilty of serious professional misconduct by the General Medical Council in 2010 . The earlier probe found that the hospital routinely used morphine to make patients 'comfortable' as far back as 1988. Commenting on his new role, Bishop Jones said: 'I am aware of the heavy responsibility of accepting the invitation to chair the Gosport Independent Panel. 'My first priority will be to consult with the families so that their views are taken into account when framing the terms of reference. My next task will be to assemble a panel and secretariat with the appropriate skills. 'I have already met with some of the families and will ensure that the panel has regular contact throughout its duration. 'I believe the experience of chairing the Hillsborough Independent Panel will help to equip me in chairing the Gosport Independent Panel. 'Independence and integrity will be the hallmarks of the panel's work.' Gosport MP Caroline Dineage said: 'For the families involved, this has been a long and hard journey. I am pleased that the Government has expressed its commitment to addressing their ongoing concerns and finding out what really happened at Gosport War Memorial Hospital. 'I have always called for openness and transparency - the families deserve nothing less. The inquiry, selected by the families as their preferred course of action, is an important first step in finally bringing closure to this difficult case.' One of the hospital's clinicians Dr Jane Barton avoided being struck off following a General Medical Council investigation in 2010 into her treatment of patients at the hospital during the 1990s. The investigation found Dr Barton guilty of serious professional misconduct and placed 11 restrictions on her registration. Commenting after the hearing, Dr Barton said: 'I am disappointed by the decision of the GMC panel. 'Anyone following this case carefully will know that I was faced with an excessive and increasing burden in trying to care for patients at the Gosport War Memorial Hospital. 'None of the nurses who gave evidence were critical of my care of the patients in this inquiry. 'The consultants who had overall responsibility for the patients never expressed concern about my treatment and working practices. 'Throughout my career I have tried to do my very best for all my patients and have had only their interests and wellbeing at heart.'","Investigation will probe 92 deaths at Gosport War Memorial Hospital .

"Sebastien Aymar Bassong Nguena is currently playing for Watford on loan from Norwich City. The defender was captain at Carrow Road but fell out of favour towards the end of last season and moved out on loan to Vicarage Road in October. A product of the famed French academy at Clairefontaine, Bassong has also played for Metz, Newcastle United, Tottenham and Wolves. The defender also has 15 caps for Cameroon. In his second appearance in the Footballers’ Football Column, he talks about last season at Norwich, Cameroon’s terrible World Cup and his hopes for the future. Things can go up and down in football really quickly as I discovered at Norwich. Things change. If someone goes and someone else comes in [Chris Hughton was replaced by Neil Adams in April] with a different mindset your situation changes. You can see the difference between the way it was and the way it is. But I've dealt with it. It’s now in the past and I don’t want to go in to the situation again. It is part of my career.

Bassong celebrates scoring for Norwich at Everton back in November 2012 with Anthony Pilkington . Of course it was disappointing to see Norwich relegated and I was sad not to play in the games near the end. As regards the future, I don’t want to think about it. When the time comes, I will talk about it. I am just enjoying playing regularly, I am grateful for the chance and I want to be 1,000 per cent focused for Watford. It's been so far, so good at Watford. I'm really happy here, especially after not playing for a while. I'm enjoying competing at the top of the Championship. We are an attacking side and when we are performing we are capable of scoring plenty of goals. I don't know what will happen when my loan ends in January. I will talk to Norwich and I will talk to Watford. For the moment, I am just trying to focus and get my rhythm back. Watford have a really ambitious owner who is trying to do good things. Step-by-step we are getting there. We all want to do well and I feel we are on the right path. Bassong (left) in action for new club Watford against Nottingham Forest striker Britt Assombalonga . Watford are flying high in the Championship, one of a cluster of teams with promotion ambitions . It's always difficult when the club is changing managers, as happened at Watford earlier in the season, but as players you have to cope with it and the squad here has coped really well. All you can do is focus - you know what you have to do and that's win games. It’s a bit awkward when you have four managers but this happens in football. It can be very short-term for managers these days. The World Cup left every citizen of Cameroon disappointed about the results and the incidents that happened. It went against the Cameroon culture and you can’t defend what is indefensible. The Cameroonian people could not wait for it all to finish. It was an embarrassment. If I am to get my place back in the national team, I do need a run of games. That didn’t happen for me before the World Cup and I didn’t get picked. But it is not a big deal. Cameroon and the national team is in my DNA and I am always available to them. Cameroon's defence stands motionless as Croatia's Mario Mandzukic celebrates in their 4-0 World Cup win . Alex Song sees red in Cameroon's World Cup group match with Croatia in Manaus . Bassong in action for Cameroon against Denmark at the last World Cup in 2010 . The Championship is a very competitive division. There are many, many teams who could go up. It is very physical and it is demanding because you are often playing Saturday then Tuesday then Saturday. The pace and the level is different to the Premier League. I can understand why many players can struggle with the intensity. At Watford, we are trying to find that consistency week-in, week-out, get back to the top and open up a gap. I did find it physically tough at first as I had to get my body used to playing every week again. With the games so close together, it is important to get enough rest but I like the fact that the busy schedule allows the players to bond. Slavisa Jokanovic came here with a winning mindset, a mindset that suits the club and that is shared by the players too. We play from the back and like to play good football. He’s not against me going forward either! Slavisa Jokanovic has enjoyed a fairly successful start to his tenure as Watford manager . Mauricio Pochettino has found the going tough at Bassong's old club Tottenham this season . Bassong closes out Liverpool's Raheem Sterling during his Tottenham days . It can only improve at Tottenham – they have a great squad and manager. It is 50-50 when someone new comes in and Mauricio Pochettino had an alright start. But things can very quickly change and not go so well. But they’ll get back up there. Chelsea look really, really strong in every area from the goalkeeper to the strikers. They have experience, strength, style and quality. They will be confident they can go the entire season unbeaten but the magic of the Premier League is that there is a long way to go and anything can happen yet. Which defenders do I admire? Raphael Varane at Real Madrid is very, very talented and still so young. I also really like watching Thiago Silva at Paris Saint-Germain. Bassong is a big admirer of the Real Madrid and France defender Raphael Varane . Thiago Silva, of Brazil and Paris Saint-Germain, has also impressed Bassong . Bassong's former Tottenham team-mate Gareth Bale has enjoyed an excellent start to life at Real Madrid . Gareth Bale has had an outstanding impact at Real Madrid. Wow. He is a part of Real now despite the pressure of his transfer fee. For me, his first season was amazing. Few leave the country at all but he did and he is learning Spanish and on the pitch he is just flying. He is doing his part, scores great goals and has had a special impact. There were loads of rumours about the threat of Ebola at the Africa Cup of Nations but it is good that the tournament had now been moved to a safe place for the players and the fans. The likes of Nigeria will always be the favourites but sometimes you can get a surprise – look at Zambia when they won in 2012. I hope that Cameroon can do well, they will go there and try to win it. After the difficulties of the last six months, I just want to stay healthy and play week-in, week-out. If I can stay injury free, I believe I’ll do well and my team will do well.

"It may be the UK’s most successful film of all time, but it’s also one of the most error-strewn. Skyfall has 35 continuity mistakes which means the film starring Daniel Craig as secret agent James Bond has come second in a poll of the top ten most gaffe-ridden films of the year. Top of the list is Men In Black III which had 63 errors. Error-prone: Daniel Craig as James Bond in 2012's Skyfall. The film contained 35 mistakes despite costing £100million to make . Skyfall's most obvious blunder happened in the opening car chase scene, the jeep that Mr Bond and a female agent are driving crashes. She knocks out the cracked windshield, but later on, the window appears perfectly in place . In third place is the Hollywood action film The Amazing Spider-Man, followed by The Avengers in fourth. Last night film critic Barry Norman said: ‘If you analyse the number of continuity errors it’s astonishing how many mistakes seem to go under the radar but there’s no accounting for human error’. But Mr Norman, 79, said continuity errors do not hinder the enjoyment of the film. He said: ‘I never really noticed these so called bloopers and I’ve been watching films ever since I can remember. 'To be honest I think the people who pick these things out have far too much time on their hands’. Chart-topping: Men in Black III starring (left to right) Josh Brolin, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, had the most blunders in any 2012 film . Error-strewn: The third film in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy The Dark Knight Rises had 24 mistakes in it . Also on the list is the multi-million pound film franchise The Hunger Games, as well as the final instalment in the Batman series: The Dark Knight Rises. The top ten films with the most mistakes in 2012: . 1. Men In Black III (63) 2. Skyfall (35) 3. Batman: The Dark Knight Rises (24) 4. The Amazing Spiderman (24) 5. The Avengers (22) 6. Looper (14) 7. Prometheus (13) 8. Argo (13) 9. Underworld: Awakening (10) 10. The Hunger Games (10) The errors have been compiled by moviemistakes.com, a website which encourages fans to email in and point out the blunders they notice. Earlier this week it was revealed Skyfall is the first film to take £100million at the UK box office. It is still on general release more than two months after it first hit Britain’s cinemas. And although Skyfall had a budget of more than £100million, it appears not enough of the cash went into the editing and continuity. The most obvious blunder happened in the opening car chase scene, the jeep that Mr Bond and a female agent are driving crashes. She knocks out the cracked windshield, but later on, the window appears perfectly in place. Another error involves Bond’s black lace-up shoes morphing seamlessly into ankle boots while he battles an assassin aboard a moving train. And another mistake involves Mr Craig’s co-star Dame Judi Dench who plays Bond’s boss M in the film. When Bond meets with M in her office, M - who is silhouetted from behind - is wearing one dangling earring and one clip on earring. When the shot moves to a side view, M has two clip on earrings. In the action film Men in Black III, which took £624 million worldwide, a little alien sneaks inside the character Boris’s hand, and at one point his fingers are stretched out in one shot, yet bent a frame later. In another sequence when the character ‘J’ is trapped by the Chinese alien’s tongue, a red napkin magically appears on the counter. Film: The Amazing Spiderman (2012) with Andrew Garfield in the lead roll came joint third with 24 mistakes . Third on the list is the Hollywood action adventure The Amazing Spider-Man, a reboot of the popular comic book series. It had a budget of more than £230million, and grossed in excess of £700million at the box office worldwide. But fans pointed out 24 mistakes in the continuity. In one scene when fighting against the character Lizard in the lab, Peter’s jacket changes randomly from spotless, to covered in dust, to partially covered in dust. And in another scene when Lizard confronts Peter by the lockers, a girl with a blue striped sweater runs by twice between shots. Other films to make the top ten include the final instalment of the Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises, which has 24 errors, and The Hunger Games with a total of 10. Gaffes: The Hunger Games, starring Jennifer Lawrence (pictured) was tenth on the list with 10 mistakes .","Men In Black III tops the Moviemistakes.com 2012 list with 63 errors .

"Born out of the Iraqi War in 2003, Islamic State's deadly grip has stretched across the Middle East and into northern-Africa where today, only the Mediterranean Sea separates the militants from Europe. It has conquered regions of Iraq, Syria and recently Libya while building a terrifying support structure in Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt's Sinai Province, Afghanistan, Tunisia and Algeria. And this tyrannical expansion is all part of its 'global strategy' to seize control of destablised countries while 'engaging in all-out battle against the West,' The Institute for the Study of War told MailOnline. Counter-terrorism analyst Harleen Gambhir said: 'What we've started to see is ISIS has begun to accelerate its operation to activate these sleeper groups that its reaching out to and it's having international effects.' The vastness of its influence went largely unnoticed among the wider public until Sunday when it released a gruesome  video showing the beheadings of 21 Egyptian Christians on a Libyan beach. Growth of terror: Since its formation as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in 2013 - it has conquered regions of Iraq, Syria and recently Libya - while building support among marginalised Muslims in Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt's Sinai Province, Afghanistan, Tunisia and Algeria . The strength of ISIS' control went largely unnoticed until footage of 21 Egyptian Christians being beheaded on a beach in Libya (pictured) emerged . Control: Supporters brazenly show their support for Islamic State in their Iraqi stronghold of Mosul (pictured), which the government is now trying to take back . Expansion: As the West's gaze was transfixed on Islamic State's brutal acts of terror in Iraq and Syria, it was gaining support from marginalised Muslims as far as Kashmir (pictured) on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border . The country's proximity to Europe and its role as a 'hub' for radicalism now poses a 'disaster scenario' according to Middle East and Africa legal consultants Perim Associates. Its Chief Executive Ethan Chorin told MailOnline: 'There is real concern that dynamics in Libya could destabilise neighboring states like Algeria which, like Egypt, has had a long and particularly violent battle with extremism. 'Radicals from neighboring countries have been using Libya as a refuge and a base for operations against their home countries.' ISIS commands 31,500 loyal fighters according to the CIA but a commander of the Kurdish fighters who battled the extremists told the Independent on Sunday that they number closer to 200,000. Its growth in power and territory has been staggering since 2004 when it was known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). The group played a prominent role in the violent insurgency against the US and British occupation of Iraq after toppling Saddam Hussein's rule in 2003. After a string of bombings and murders over the next two years, its membership grew to around 1,000 according to the Washington Monthly. AQI then merged with its Mujahideen Shura Council allies in October 2006 to form the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI). During the Iraq War which took place between 2006 and 2008, ISI had strongholds in Mosul, Baghdad, Al-Anbar and Diyala and commanded between 1,000 and 2,500 soldiers by late 2012. When it expanded into Syria in April 2013, it finally transformed into the Islamic State of Iraq in Syria (ISIS) as it exists today. Islamic State has now self-proclaimed the Syrian city of Raqqa as its capital, although there have been reports of increased defections. New ground: Its presence in Libya went largely unnoticed - but footage emerged of terrorist group Ansar al-Sharia parading a fleet of Toyota Land Cruisers in Benghazi while carrying Islamic State flags . Europe's doorstep: Islamic State has now gained control of a number of Libyan coastal towns including Benghazi, Sirte, Derna and Nofilia . It was once a rebel group defying the British and US occupation of Iraq. Now other extremists across the Middle East and northern-Africa are pledging allegiance to it. 'ISIS has name brand power,' Harleen Gambhir says. 'What we've seen in a few different places is ISIS ability to transfer new military expertise, explosives planning, new planning to other groups to win over their allegiance and we're seeing that in Libya.' Terrorist organisations inside the country such as Ansar al-Sharia - which has taken control of Benghazi and declared its own Islamic state - also announced its alliance with ISIS in 2014. While Yemen-based militant group Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) - one of Al-Qaeda's most powerful branches - defected to ISIS this month according to US monitoring group SITE. And while it has no confirmed territory in Tunisia, the country has become a breeding ground for ISIS fighters with the Interior Ministry claiming 2,400 citizens had become combatants since 2011. ISIS does control regions in the north and west of Iraq, including Fallujah near the capital Baghdad and its second largest city Mosul. It continued presence in Iraq has forced the West into action, with the US announcing it will train as many as 25,000 Iraqi soldiers to retake it. Fighters in Kobane, northern-Iraq were able to successfully expel the insurgents from its village last month with the aid of Coalition air strikes. But Western aggression only fuels Islamic State's propaganda, counter-terrorism think tank Quillam has said. Fightback: The majority of ISIS' territory lies inside Iraq and Syria but there have been recent reports of defections in Syria, while Iraq plan to retake its second city of Mosul from the Jihadists . Researcher Charlie Winter told MailOnline: 'One of the mainstays of IS ideology is provocation. So air strikes by the Coalition were always going to be interpreted as air strikes by the crusaders. 'What better propaganda can you use to convince people there is a conspiracy against the Muslim world than showing horrible images of children who have been killed in air strikes?' 'Their ability to menace and intimidate the rest of the world is all based on propaganda. If you took away their propaganda, they would not look nearly as dangerous.' In Egypt's Sinai region, which became the centre of a violent insurgency after Hosni Mubarak was overthrown, the Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis militant group has pledged its support to ISIS. As did Algerian-based miltants Jund al-Khilafah - or soldiers of the Caliphate - who swore their loyalty to ISIS after kidnapping and beheading a French citizen in September. Earlier this year, pro-ISIS slogans and graffiti even began to appear on walls in North Waziristan, Pakistan. Local Taliban groups there have considered joining ISIS after becoming frustrated by the army's almost total control in the region, the BBC has reported. Propaganda: Experts say Islamic State's brutal execution videos are designed to entice the West into a war, while more 'inane' videos are planned to build support among 'marginalised Muslims' Exaggerated presence: Counter-terrorism experts also believe the group uses effective and carefully produced propaganda videos to amplify 'the exact amount of power it has in a region' Extremism: Islamist groups in Egypt, Nigeria, Libya and even the Philippines have pledged their support to Islamic State . Although it controls no territory in the country, the New York Times says it has declared an interest in the country and its neighbour Afghanistan - where it has reportedly sent envoys to recruit. Nigeria's Boko Haram publicly declared its support for the Sunni extremists just one month after it established a worldwide Islamic caliphate in June 2014. There have even been reports of guerrilla units taking its brand of brutal militancy to the Philippines, where its spokesperson said: 'We have an alliance with the Islamic State and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.' Experts say the group's recent surge in military support is down to obscure propaganda videos showing the militants fixing roads and planting flowers which are 'enticing' to Jihadists excited about the idea of a global caliphate. It also uses effective and carefully produced propaganda videos which could 'exaggerate the exact amount of power it has in a region'.","ISIS began as Al-Qaeda in Iraq in 2004 and militants had just 1,000 soldiers, but it has grown to more than 30,000 .
Reach of ISIS now spans Middle East and northern Africa, with only the Mediterranean sea separating from Europe .

"Daley Blind's agent says Manchester United are yet to launch a bid to sign his client. Blind is understood to be on Louis van Gaal's transfer shortlist, but the Manchester United manager has not made a move for the Ajax utility man, according to his representative Rob Jansen.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Daley Blind scoring 30 yard screamer against Utrecht . Sitting tight: Manchester United have not made a bid for Ajax's Daley Blind, according to his agent . Van Gaal knows Blind well from his time in charge of the Dutch national side. The 24-year-old son of former Holland international Danny Blind, can operate at left-back or in central midfield, where United are in desperate need of reinforcements. United expect to complete the record £59.7million transfer of Angel di Maria from Real Madrid on Tuesday, and more signings are expected thereafter.

United could make a move for Arturo Vidal, although the club have reservations about the state of the Juventus midfielder's right knee, which was operated on in May.

"Employees at New York City's Medical Examiner's Office have been accused of sickening abuses of privilege by looking at autopsy pictures and reports of recent high-profile deaths such as Philip Seymour Hoffman and Mick Jagger's girlfriend, L'Wren Scott. According to whistleblowers inside the department, the intimate details of the celebrities last moments and graphic photographs have been sordidly passed around and ME staff not authorized to see the files have been accessing the system anyway. Insider's at the office, which is supposed to keep these kinds of details confidential, have told the New York Post that the practice is rife and that it is relatively easy to pull the information despite efforts to plug the gaps. No respect: It has been alleged that employees of New York City's Medical Examiner's Office have been accessing and looking at the autopsy pictures and files of actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Mick Jagger's girlfriend, L'Wren Scott (right, with the Rolling Stone) Philip Seymour Hoffman died of a drugs overdose in February after being kicked out of the family home by his partner and L'Wren Scott committed suicide in March, reportedly in millions of dollars of debt. 'Too many people have access to the files - crime scene photos, autopsy reports - and share it was co-workers,' said an ME souce to the Post. Despite efforts to stop the indiscriminate peeking, the office has failed to prevent the  voyeuristic leering because there are 'a million holes' in the ME's operational system. ME spokeswoman Julie Bolcer denied the whistleblower’s claims. Last public pictures: Philip Seymour Hoffman is pictured here in Utah in January at the Sundance Film Festival - two weeks before his death . Tragedy: Philip Seymour Hoffman's body is brought out of his West Village apartment in February . 'Only authorized employees who use our systems for their daily casework have access. There are extensive security measures in place,' she said. This news comes in the week that it was revealed that Hoffman, 46, who died of a drugs overdose in February inside his Manhattan apartment, did not heed his accountant's advice to leave his $35 million fortune to his children. The Oscar winner bristled against any ideas his children would be 'trust fund' kids and in a July 18 filing in the Manhattan Surrogate Court, the actor's accountant David Friedman recalled conversations with Hoffman where the topic of a trust for his children was raised. He said Hoffman wanted his estimated $35 million fortune to go his longtime partner and the children's mother, Mimi O'Donnell. Hoffman was found dead in his Manhattan apartment in February of a drug overdose. Privacy: A medical examiners van leaves The scene outside the Chelsea apartment building on March 17, 2014 in New York City, where fashion designer L'Wren Scott, 47, was found dead from an apparent suicide . Ms Spencer, a costume designer who met the actor in 1999, had reportedly recently kicked him out of the family's $4.2million apartment as he tried to get his drug problem under control. The actor admitted struggling with drug addiction in the past, and reportedly checked himself into rehab in May last year for heroin abuse after 23 years of being clean. According to the filing, Friedman said the Oscar-winning actor treated O'Donnell 'in the same manner as if she were a spouse'. Hoffman told the accountant that he just didn't believe in marriage. The court-appointed attorney says the actor's will should be approved by the court because there isn't anything suspicious about it. Attorney James Cahill Jr., interviewed Hoffman's accountant as part of his court-appointed duties to protect the interests of Hoffman’s children, Cooper, ten, Tallulah, seven, and five-year-old Willa, according to the New York Post. Hoffman also said that he wanted his son to be raised in Manhattan, Chicago or San Francisco, an edict that was written before his daughters were born. Mick Jagger, 71, was devastated when his lover, L'Wren Scott was found dead in her New York apartment in March. An inquest ruled she had committed suicide.

"Less than 24 hours before one of the biggest-ever FA Cup giant-killings, Bradford's players are sitting in Kensington's Marriott Hotel watching Celebrity Big Brother. There are more enthralling ways to spend Friday night in London, but for these players the excitement is all to come. Two down against Chelsea on Saturday, the League One side mustered a glorious comeback, scoring four times to leave Jose Mourinho's hopes of an historic quadruple in tatters and the Chelsea boss talking of being 'ashamed'. But how did this team of free transfers pull it off? Bradford's players celebrate in front of their travelling supporters at Stamford Bridge after beating Chelsea . The League One side were only the fourth side to score four goals against a team managed by Jose Mourinho . Goalscorer Andrew Halliday (centre) and his team-mates enjoy the result on the Stamford Bridge pitch . 4 - Bradford became the fourth opponents to score four goals against a team coached by Mourinho after Barcelona (2010, 0-5), Borussia Dortmund (2013, 1-4) and Tottenham (2015, 3-5). The Bantams are the first team ever to do it away from home. 2008 - The last time Chelsea lost to a lower league team in the FA Cup was against Barnsley in 2008. Jon Stead has scored four goals and assisted four in his last five FA Cup games. 1 - This is the first time Chelsea have conceded more than two goals at home this season in all competitions. £7,500 - Striker James Hanson is the only Bradford player to command a fee, £7,500. In contrast, Chelsea’s starting line-up cost a whopping £101million. 10 - Mourinho’s side have conceded 10 goals in 2015 — only four teams in the Premier League, Championship, League One and League Two have let in more in the same period. Former Chelsea winger Filipe Morais  has scored three goals and provided two assists in his last five FA Cup games for Bradford. 1958 - Chelsea conceded four goals to a third-tier team for the first time since 1958, when they lost 4-1 to Darlington — the goals coming from Tommy Moran (two), Ron Harbertson and Dave Carr. Parkinson started devising his Stamford Bridge blueprint on Thursday, taking shape and tactical sessions aimed at nullifying Chelsea's threat. Midfielder Filipe Morais said: 'We had an idea they might rest a few players and that gave us more confidence.' Parkinson informed his squad of the starting line-up after Friday morning's training session and they arrived in Kensington at 5.30pm. They sat down for dinner in the plush hotel restaurant at 6.30pm, when players were given a choice of steak, pasta or chicken, and whisper it, a small bowl of apple crumble and custard. With no curfew, players retreated to their rooms to watch Cambridge v Manchester United. Some, though, found themselves switching over midway through the clash at Abbey Road to Channel 5 for some lighter viewing. Those who stuck with the football were impressed by Cambridge's gutsy display in securing a goalless draw. 'They were hungry and I took great inspiration watching them,' revealed Morais. Bradford's soon-to-be heroes were back in the hotel restaurant between 8am-10am for breakfast before congregating in the lobby at 11.30pm for a 10-minute pre-match walk around Kensington. Some did impressions of Jose Mourinho to ease their nerves, while goalkeeping coach Lee Butler — very much the joker in the Bradford pack — did his utmost to keep the players relaxed. Bradford had lunch at the hotel at 11.45am before setting off for Stamford Bridge at 1.15pm. As they got caught in some light Fulham Road traffic they were confronted with a heart-warming ice-breaker as thousands of Bradford fans, enjoying a few pre match beverages, swarmed the coach to provide the loudest of good luck messages. Arriving at Stamford Bridge at 1.30pm, some stayed in dressing room until the warm-up, while others immediately took a stroll on to the pitch to soak in the growing atmosphere. Less than 24 hours before the victory, Bradford watched Katie Price and Co on Channel 5's Big Brother . The League One side stayed in Kensington's Marriott Hotel ahead of the FA Cup clash against Chelsea . Some of the Bradford squad watched Cambridge's draw with Man United and took inspiration from the result . Parkinson re-iterated his side's gameplan in the team talk 10 minutes before kick-off - to break down the flanks, not to run through the middle of Chelsea, to hit diagonal balls into tall forward James Hanson allowing attacking midfielder Billy Knott to pick up second balls, not to press all over the pitch but only in their own half and to minimize any risk taking. Then it was time for Parkinson to inspire; ordering his charges to believe in themselves, convincing them they were fitter than Chelsea. 'We were all in their wishing each other luck, it was really genuine,' said Morais. 'At some clubs you'll see players just tap someone and say 'good luck' and not really mean it. But we were all shaking hands and hugging and we meant it.' Filipe Morais (left) runs away to celebrate after Mark Yeates sealed Bradford's historic win . Former Chelsea midfielder Morais celebrates wildly after finding the back of the net against his old club . Chelsea's players are left dejected after Bradford's stunning comeback in west London on Saturday . And there was even time for one more wise crack when one player's over-zealous attempts to gee-up his team-mates with some rather colourful language prompted substitute Alan Sheehan to tell his team-mate to calm down, prompting a huge ripple of laughter. As they opened the door into the tunnel, Chelsea were already waiting for them. For Morais, who played in Mourinho's first ever game as Chelsea manager, this was a poignant moment. But his attempts to remain focused were scuppered by his old mentor. 'As I come out I hear a scream of: ""Filipe Morais"" in a Portuguese accent. It's Jose,' said Morais. 'I didn't know where to look. I said: ""Hello Mister"" which is gaffer in Portuguese. He shook my hand, gave me a hug and said to me you're 29 now, you're a big man. 'At that time I didn't want to see him because I was so focused. That's just Jose.' Jose Mourinho (right) exchanges some angry words with his opposite number Phil Parkinson . Jon Stead (right) scores for Bradford to make it 2-1 and give the visitors some hope late in the first half . Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech dives to try and stop Stead's effort but comes up short . After the first 39 minutes, you could forgive Morais for fearing that his impromptu reunion with Mourinho would be the highlight of his afternoon as Chelsea raced into a 2-0 lead. But Jon Stead's phenomenal strike before half-time changed the game's complexion. And then came the moment that will remain with Morais for the rest of his life. Here it is in his own words: 'It was an easy tap in but it was crazy. I dreamt about it twice in the week. 'Before the game I thought I wouldn't celebrate scoring against Chelsea. In my mind I didn't know what to do, but my overriding emotion was that I scored for Bradford, they deserve my passion.' 'We could sense the tide was changing, we could smell it,' said Morais. Mark Yeates beats the Chelsea defence and slots home past Cech to make it 4-2 to Bradford . Chelsea boss Mourinho admitted he felt ashamed after Chelsea's defeat by the League One side . Bradford boss Parkinson is hoping to draw Manchester United if they beat Cambridge in a replay . Indeed it was, two more goals and Bradford were legends.

"Say cheese! This baby great white is in quite the great mood — and he's ready to show off his big smile along California's Golden Coast. The amazing footage out of Monterey, just south of San Fransciso, shows the growing predator swimming along the harbor as a group of tourists watch. Videographer Patrick Anders Webster on Monday submerged his camera at Monterey Beach Harbor and captured the incredibly photogenic fish. The little white shark appears to smile a toothy grin as he swims around the clear-watered harbor. Hello! The baby white shark swims close to diver Patrick Webster off the coast of Monterey Beach, California . The juvenile fish appears to smile as it swoops by the camera . The shark show happened at Monterey Beach Harbor, where this type of shark doesn't usually swim. Experts say they're showing up that far north along the California coast due to unusually warmer waters . Tourists can be seen gathering in the dock as the shark swims laps around. 'Adults and children were amazed and intrigued after the lifeguards identified it as a harmless shark,' eyewitness Rachael Zalan told KSBW. 'There was a giant crowd following it as it was cruising in the shallows for a good 20 minutes.' Wildlife experts at the Monterey Beach Aquarium say these juvenile white sharks can usually be found along the coast of southern California and Mexico. The warmer fall waters sometimes will draw the unusual guests much farther north. After capturing the stunning footage, Webster could only say: 'WOW. I mean...

"As far as foreign investors in English football go, Valeri Belokon - a garish tangerine suit aside - is one of the more inconspicuous. But the Blackpool president, widely credited with funding the club’s startling rise to the Premier League, has had enough. In his most revealing interview since buying a 20 per cent stake in the Seasiders eight years ago, Belokon does not hold back in tearing into the running of the crisis club. The Latvian millionaire takes aim at the controlling family, the Oystons, whose stubbornness with new manager Jose Riga saw just eight players contracted to the club three weeks before the Championship season. He implores them to pay back the parachute payments they have taken out of the club and claims ‘some people lose their mind when they’ve got so much’. Blackpool president Valeri Belokon is unhappy with the running of the club under the ownership of the Oystons . Belokon sat down to speak with Sportsmail reporter Jack Gaughan in the Latvian captial of Riga this week . Blackpool fans have long been protesting for owner Karl Oyston to leave the club as their club sit bottom . Belokon is credited with funding the club's rise to the Premier League after buying into the club eight years ago . Belokon claims Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston doesn't care what division the club play in . Blackpool’s recent history is entrenched in bitterness and disappointment at the missed opportunities after striking it rich by winning promotion four years ago. Belokon - speaking in Russian so as to not mix his words - backed supporters protesting against the ownership at Bloomfield Road. Talking at his Baltic International Bank headquarters in Riga, with a Havana cigar nestled between index and middle fingers, he left little unturned. Belokon, 54, announced he has opened legal proceedings against owner Owen Oyston and his son, chairman Karl, over unpaid loans and could lodge a bid to buy the club. He has sounded out a wealthy local investor who wants to partner him if, crucially, the Oystons included the stadium and properties in any deal. Kaspars Varpins, a director at Blackpool, takes a stroll besides Belokon and Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan . Belokon has opened legal proceedings against the Oystons and is willing to buy the club . ‘I wouldn’t be able to do it alone but I’m ready to be a partner. They need to be local. I have to be able to believe in them now I’ve had this experience with the Oyston family,’ he said. ‘Given Karl’s addictiveness to money, it won’t be easy in the short term. ‘It would be fair if they told the fans “we love money more than the club and help us sell”. Karl doesn’t care what league Blackpool play in.’ He added: ‘Soon it will be a point of no return. We asked our lawyers to start requesting a breakdown of the financial information not shown in the accounts over the last five years we are entitled to. It’s a letter before action. They have basically ignored us before now. Blackpool supporters staged a mass walk-out against the owners during October's clash against Cardiff . Current manager Jose Riga began the season with just eight players and the club have endured a poor start . July 2006 - Valeri Belokon buys 20 per cent stake in the club. May 2007 - Simon Grayson’s side promoted to the Championship. December 2008 - Grayson leaves for Leeds. January/February 2009 - Caretaker boss Tony Parkes given money to sign Charlie Adam and DJ Campbell and the club stay up. July 2009 - Ian Holloway appointed and calls training ground a ‘hell hole’ August 2009 - Belokon sets up player trust fund after directors refuse to sanction £500,000 permanent deal for Adam. March 2010 - South Stand - funded by Belokon - is opened. May 2010 - Blackpool reach Premier League via play-off final, with Belokon wearing a tangerine suit. Players are promised shared £5m bonus. November 2010 - Adam wins court case over unpaid bonuses. January 2011 - Blackpool lie 12th in top flight. May 2011 - Relegated. March 2012 - Accounts reveal Oystons paid £11m salaries. Monies transferred to other companies without Belokon’s approval. May 2012 - Lose Championship play-off final. November 2012 - Holloway joins Crystal Palace. January 2013 - Michael Appleton leaves for Blackburn after just 65 days in charge. March 2013 - Last time Belokon flew to Blackpool. July 2014 - Belokon issues open letter to Karl Oyston criticising the chairman, who hits back days later. Jose Riga has just eight players three weeks before new season. ‘I thought I was investing in a club and I feel as if I’ve invested in the Oyston family. We voted against the £11million salary from the parachute money and some other payments. They paid no attention. The only reason Owen would have a salary was for bringing me to the club.’ He laughed but there is more than a tinge of resentment. ‘I’m not angry... I pity. The optimist in me says we can still work but I’m very sceptical now. There are emotions, ambitions and Blackpool has to come first.’ Karl Oyston had argued in 2012: ‘The £11m was paid out as part of sound tax planning - we’re UK-based and believe in paying our taxes but still have to plan sensibly. But, frankly, after the way he has supported the club all these years, if it was an £11m salary to my father, so what?’ Belokon, who asserts he is owed around £9m in direct loans, has not been to Lancashire since March 2013 ‘because they don’t listen’ and has spent a minimal amount on the club over the last four years. ‘They shouldn’t have needed my money.’ Blackpool remain rooted to the bottom of the Championship following Saturday's 3-0 defeat to Reading . Belokon has not been to Lancashire since March 2013 and has spent little money on the club in recent years . The partnership began fruitfully. Then manager Simon Grayson was backed in order to keep the team in League One and won promotion the following year. The foreign money man set up a modest ‘player fund’ to alleviate problems the Oystons were enduring when bringing in new faces. Belokon claims Ian Holloway was ready to resign two months into the job after initially being told he couldn’t sign Rangers’ Charlie Adam for £500,000. Adam was purchased through the fund and became a major factor in their promotion. ‘It’s likely we wouldn’t have reached the top without this trust fund,’ said Belokon. ‘We agreed I would take 70 per cent of sales from players bought through the fund but I changed. I took 30 per cent and gave the club the rest from the sale of Adam.’ He alleges the club asked him to plough more money in to fund players after Adam left for Liverpool: ‘Maybe it was a joke... But I think Karl thinks I’m stupid. If you love something you’re stupid.’ Ian Holloway, pictured after winning promotion in 2010, was ready to resign from the club after just two months . Belokon smiles and applauds following Blackpool's 3-2 play-off final victory against Cardiff  at Wembley . It was a swelteringly hot day at Wembley against Cardiff in the Championship play-off final when Belokon overtly showed what an exuberant character he can be. The tangerine suit. ‘I made a promise to wear the suit. We had 10 days after the semi-final and the tailors all said no. I had it made quickly by those in the theatre here in Riga.’ Fans still buy into that ebullience but the Oystons less so. In an open letter posted on the club’s website in July, Karl slammed Belokon for asking for £24m. The latter said that figure is ‘out of context’ - that he never asked for that to be taken from club funds - and said the suggestion he was involved in money laundering in Kyrgyzstan was ‘nonsense’. The case was thrown out on Friday by an arbitration tribunal, and the Kyrgyz government was ordered to pay more than £10m for seizing his ‘Manas Bank’. The purchase of Charlie Adam was made through a 'modest player fund' set up by the club's Latvian president . Adam played a huge part in the club's promotion to the Premier League and netted in the Wembley final . Belokon had initially flown to the Fylde Coast to flog his brand of beer in the hope they would stock it on matchdays. The joke goes he was so bad at selling that Owen enticed him to spend £1.8m on shares. ‘When I came it was a very similar situation to now. It’s symbolic - the first time I arrived there were fans carrying an “Oyston out” banner,’ Belokon added. ‘Owen joked that I shouldn’t pay attention. He said “out” was his last name. ‘I fell in love with Blackpool. I received different proposals to buy other English clubs but this is about heart and soul - I can make money elsewhere. I have no other club. Belokon insists he wants to stay with Blackpool but is not prepared to invest in the Oyston family . ‘Owen can reverse this situation if he wants but there is a small chance of that. We would have the strength to achieve what we did before.’ What Belokon regrets is the extra millions he poured in for no return. He was responsible for the building of the Jimmy Armfield Stand and has never seen any of the profits the new structure yielded. ‘Investment for football is good but this has all gone to their family,’ he said. ‘I want to stay with this club but don’t want to invest in the Oyston family. You can spit on the fans but if they do it to you, you might drown.’ Blackpool were unavailable for comment.","Blackpool president Valeri Belokon is unhappy with  running of the club .

"Nigeria striker Peter Odemwingie joined Stoke three days before the transfer window shut in a player-exchange deal which saw Kenwyne Jones head the other way to Cardiff. He scored his first goal for the Potters, his third Premier League club, in last weekend's 2-2 draw with Southampton. Before you read his second Footballers' Football Column, check out his video… . In football you have to be ready to make changes quickly and that has happened to me. I have moved from Cardiff to Stoke and this is a new chance to make a mark, to show what I can do. I like what I am seeing so far. I have only been here a short time but already it feels comfortable and I’m happy. The gaffer, Mark Hughes, is a man I like working with. His team talks, before and during matches, are very good. He is a passionate man who knows how to get a point across. He doesn’t join in with training too much, but every now and then the ball will come near him and he’ll do something – he can still hit a great volley! I also like his tactics. We are playing some very good football and doing well, even if the Premier League is crazy this year. It is extremely competitive. But the manager has been calm about it. He knows what he wants us to do and we are doing it. When you have that clear idea of what a manager wants it makes changing team much easier. I scored against Southampton and that helps too – it’s always important to get going fast. City slicker: Peter Odemwingie (left) swapped Cardiff City for Stoke City in the winter transfer window and is loving life under Mark Hughes (right) at the Britannia Stadium . The style of football is important. I must admit I was frustrated at Cardiff. I enjoyed being there, with a really nice group of players and good people as well. But the style of football under Malky Mackay was not really right for me. It was effective in the Championship but not in the Premier League. We played a lot of long balls and sometimes we didn’t really have wingers. As a striker, you can get isolated that way. The spirit in the team was excellent, though. I stay in touch with Steven Caulker by text and I look forward to seeing the boys when we go there to play in April. But that is football. Things change and you move on. Finishing touch: Southampton's Artur Boruc (left) is unable to stop Odemwingie's effort during the 2-2 draw . Bluebird buddy: Odemwingie has maintained his friendship with Cardiff captain Steven Caulker, here celebrating his goal against Swansea with Kevin Theophile-Catherine . For me, football is always more important than just liking a place. I wanted to move on for the sake of my football. There is a hassle that goes with it that maybe people do not understand. You go through the process of leaving a place, finding a new home, getting settled in. Luckily for me, my wife is very supportive. Her and I and our baby have moved into a small apartment for now and we will move into our old house in the summer. I still have a house in the Midlands from my time at West Brom and there is a player on loan currently living there. We’ll move in during the summer. My wife is expecting another boy in June so it is an exciting time for our family. Stoke is probably a better fit for me in a football sense. We play the ball to feet more, which is great for me. And more often than not I am playing off someone, rather than being the target myself. It suits my game more. It creates more shooting chances and that is what every striker wants. I hadn’t had a proper shooting chance in a while before the Sunderland game so to get that sight of goal and then to score felt great. These things matter to a striker. The whole place feels good right now. Stoke have this brilliant training ground, and that is good when you are a player. It is where you go to work every day. And the medical team is very good, very professional. When I arrived, I was having cramps at first because I had not been playing 90 minutes – I had been getting taken off in games at Cardiff. Now I am feeling sharper and up to speed again. The Premier League has been crazy so far. I have been around it for quite a long time and I have not seen it quite like this before. Normally, you have some idea of who is going to win and who is going to go down. There are maybe a couple of teams in the top half of the table who look like they will stay where they are. The other 18 are moving all the time. It is intense. What's the Mata? Odemwingie clips the heels of Manchetser United signing Juan Mata during Stoke's 2-1 win at the Britannia . The screamer: Odemwingie reacts to missing a chance v Southampton . A few weeks ago you would have looked at the table and thought Crystal Palace and Sunderland were going down. Now look at them. New managers have come in and totally changed their circumstances. Then you have Fulham, who were struggling quite badly and then they get a draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford. It is hard to say what will happen. The top of the table is more exciting than it has been for years. As a player, you find it quite stressful but also very exciting. There is so much on every game. Even now, at the start of February, it feels like the games mean so much. If you go four or five games without winning you are going to be in huge trouble. If you go four or five games without losing, you will jump up the table. I think this next month will be crucial.","I was frustrated with the football at Cardiff, it was effective for the Championship .

"An ancient stone monument marking the grave of a king’s nephew who inspired one of the greatest love stories in British history is to be moved - to make way for a housing estate. The 'Tristan Stone' was erected 1,500 years ago, reputedly to show the final resting place of Tristan, whose forbidden affair with the beautiful Irish princess Isolde has inspired poets for centuries. But a council has now given a developer permission to move the stone, described by English Heritage as 'a significant scheduled monument', to a nearby field so that they can build a housing estate and park and ride next to the site. Testament to doomed lovers: The Tristan Stone in its current site in Cornwall . Local campaigners are furious at Cornwall Council's decision to move the 5th Century stone from its spot outside Fowey so that Wainhomes can begin development work there. Bert Biscoe, a member of Cornwall Council's cabinet, said: 'Such desecration is the equivalent . of Napoleon shooting at the Sphinx for target practice.' The developer plans to build 80 homes as well as a park-and-ride on the land close to the A3082, and have been given permission as long as they move the seven-foot high stone monument to a nearby field. Mr Biscoe, condemned the decision to shift the ancient obelisk as 'cultural violence' and one of the 'worst attacks on heritage in the world'. He said: 'How dare anybody . presume to shift it without good reason? Building a mundane houses in . its vicinity is not good reason. Ancient relic: The Tristan Stone is 1,500 years old . 'It’s an infringement of the cultural integrity of Cornwall; it is cultural violence.' Cornwall Council confirmed permission for . the homes had been granted subject to agreement on a number of issues, . including the relocation of the Tristan Stone. A spokesman for Wainhomes said moving the stone was a condition imposed on the company. He said: 'We would be quite happy for . it to remain where it is and we are simply responding to concerns . raised during the planning process.' According to legend, Tristan was killed by his uncle, King Mark of Cornwall for falling in love with his Irish wife, Isolde, also known as Isolde. Tristan, a Cornish knight, is said to have fled Cornwall a number of times, often going into hiding with Sir Lancelot, one of King Arthur’s Knights Of The Round Table. According to one of several versions of the legend, he eventually died (different versions have different culprits) and is said to have been buried in a field near Fowey, Cornwall, close to the stone monument. The love story later inspired poems by Biroul, Thomas of Britain and Gottfried von Strassburg and the opera Tristan und Isolde by Richard Wagner. Touching history: The story of Tristan and Isolde is one of the greatest romances in history . Forbidden lovers: James Franco and Sophia Myles in the 2006 film Tristan and Isolde . New site for the stone: This is where Cornwall Council want the developer to relocate the stone to . The story of Tristan, a Cornish knight and Isolde, or Iseult, an Irish princess, is an ancient Celtic legend that became popular in the12th Century through French medieval poetry.  Several versions of the tale exist. One popular telling of the story has Tristan defeating an Irish knight and bringing back the beautiful Isolde for his uncle, King Mark, to marry. Tristan and Isolde unwittingly drink a love potion on their way back from Ireland and fall in love.  One version of the legend says the potion's effects last a lifetime, another says just three years. Isolde has to marry King Mark, but she and Tristan seek each other out as lovers because of the potion. After evading several attempts by courtiers to entrap them, the lovers are eventually shown up to the King who sentences them to death. In one version, King Mark poisons Tristan while he is playing the harp to Isolde and she is so upset that her lover is dying, she begs him to crush her to death so they can die together, which he does. In another version, Tristan escapes on his way to the gallows and rescues Isolde, but the pair are later caught. King Mark agrees to pardon Tristan if he hands Isolde back to him and goes abroad, and Tristan goes to France where he marries another girl simply because she is called Isolde. Years later he is poisoned by a dart and can only be saved by the first Isolde.  The second Isolde tells him the first one refuses to come, and he dies in despair.  Isolde arrives to heal him and dies swooning over his corpse. Mark . was a king of Kernow (Cornwall) in the 6th Century, the son of King . Felix of Cornwall who died after a raid on his castle at Tintagel by the . King of Ireland. After this drama, the relationship between the two kingdoms was shaky, and Ireland demanded protection money from Cornwall. When King Mark refused to pay, he sent his nephew Tristan to fight . him, and bring back the beautiful Irish princess Isolde to be his wife. The story begins when Tristan and King Mark's intended drink a love potion on the way back. In various versions of the story, King Mark discovers his nephew is . cuckolding him with his wife, tries a variety of schemes to stop the . lovers or to catch them out, and eventually his suspicions are . confirmed. One telling has King Mark ordering his nephew to be hanged, and his wife to be banished to a leper colony. Another version has him as a villain who rapes his niece and . murders her when she has his child, and yet another has him murdering . Tristan with a poisoned dart while he plays the harp for Isolde. The Tristan Stone bears a Latin . inscription believed to refer to King Mark.  It says: 'Drustans hic . iacet Cunowori Filius' which translates as 'Here lies Tristan, son of . Cunomorus'. It is believed this refers to Tristan and King Mark, who was also known as Quonomorus, or Cunomorus. Again there are various versions of how King Mark met his own end . but he is believed to have been murdered by Sir Bellangre le Beuse, a . grandson of his murdered brother.","1,500-year-old Tristan Stone will be moved by developer for park and ride .

"Danny Welbeck left the Emirates Stadium with the signed match-ball from Arsenal’s 4-1 win against Galatasaray despite admitting he forgot to claim it at the final whistle. In his post-match television interview, the hat-trick hero confessed it was so long since his last treble that the protocol had escaped him. 'I forgot the match ball, didn’t I? But I’ll get it after,' said Welbeck, and he soon had the souvenir tucked under his arm. 'My last hat-trick was probably for Manchester United reserves. This is the first of my professional career.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mathieu Flamini: We're very lucky to have Danny Welbeck . Danny Welbeck (right) collected the match ball shortly after Arsenal's win, in which he scored a hat-trick . Danny Welbeck became the third Arsenal player to score a Champions League hat-trick. Predictably, Thierry Henry is another, against Roma in 2002, but even Gunners fans may struggle to name the other one. It is the much-maligned Nicklas Bendtner, who hit three against Porto in 2010. Stats courtesy of Opta . He became only the sixth Englishman to score a hat-trick in the Champions League and with four Arsenal goals for the season has already overtaken his 2014 total for Manchester United. His third of the night, seven minutes into the second half, brought Arsene Wenger to his feet as the manager celebrated his 18th anniversary of joining Arsenal with an emphatic win to put them second in Champions League Group D. The victory could not spoiled by a red-card for goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, for a foul which allowed Burak Yilmaz to score Galatasaray’s consolation goal from the penalty spot. Alexis Sanchez scored the other for the Gunners. The Gunners striker lifts the ball over Fernando Muslera to bag his first Arsenal hat-trick . Welbeck (above) celebrates scoring his third goal of the game against Galatasaray . 'I’m playing up front trying to score goals and get opportunities and tonight it paid off and I got the three goals,' said Welbeck. 'The manager has shown a lot of faith in me and I’m delighted to pay him back. He has given me a chance to play football up front in my preferred position and I’m going to do everything I can to make sure that he is happy.' Asked for his pick of the three, he said: 'The last one I think, because I was stretching for it. I’ve been in that position a few times and chipped the keeper and sometimes it goes in and sometimes it doesn’t. Today I've seen him coming him out and he slid in. 'We’ve set the benchmark now and we have really got to try and grow on that win. From now on we want to get three points in every game.' Welbeck praised Gunners manager Arsene Wenger for 'showing faith' in the English forward . Alexis Sanchez (right) put Arsenal into a commanding 3-0 lead just before half-time . Welbeck became the sixth Englishman to score a Champions League hat-trick. The others are: . Wayne Rooney, Michael Owen, Andy Cole, Alan Shearer and Mike Newell . Wenger hailed Welbeck’s contribution. 'The potential is there and hopefully this hat-trick will help him to gain confidence,' said the Arsenal boss. 'We had good pace and good movements and our finishing was good and Danny was on the end of a few. 'It helps always to know that you have a good chance to play the next game. His link up play is good as well his work-rate and his attitude is positive. He’s a team player, not only a finisher. He wants to help the team. 'I’ve learnt he’s a good finisher. I believe technically he’s very sound. That was a surprise, he’s technically clean and that he’s a good passer of the ball. I didn’t know he was so quick, honestly. I knew he was quick.

On the last leg of the flight towards home, during refuelling at 31,000ft with a KC-135 tanker, disaster struck. An official investigation later concluded that the B-52 overran in manoeuvres to hook up with the trailing fuel boom and rammed the tanker. There was an explosion and a huge fireball engulfed both aircraft. All four men on the tanker and three of the bomber’s crew died instantly. Four others managed  to eject before plunging into the  sea where they were rescued by Spanish fishermen. And the H-bombs? Mercifully there was no detonation. But while one splashed into the Mediterranean and a second drifted down on its parachute and landed intact in a dried-up river bed, the remaining two bombs split open upon impact, scattering plutonium and covering the tomato fields of Palomares with a fine and deadly radioactive dust. The rest of the world has mostly forgotten – or simply doesn’t care. Today’s holidaymakers are as oblivious to this brush with Armageddon as they are ignorant of the ancient history of these beaches where Hannibal’s war elephants once landed. The reality, however, is that Spain’s so-called Costa Bomba is scarred for ever – and  that the toxic legacy is getting worse, not better. There are 1,600 residents in this tiny farming and fishing village, half of them expatriate British, and they are understandably alarmed about the vast acres of ‘no-go’ farmland where, even now, men in masks drill deep down to search for the decaying remnants of H-bombs. No go area: A sign warns against entering one of the still-contaminated areas near the village of Palomares . Deadly legacy: American sailors recover one of the H bombs, still wrapped in its parachute, that fell into the sea, in April, four months after the crash . They are dismayed that America’s promises to clean up the mess they made have never been fulfilled, despite continuing pressure from the Spanish government. And they are furious that while America has fined BP £2.5 billion for violating US environmental and pollution laws after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, it has so far paid the residents of Palomares a pittance of £353,000 for the ruination of their livelihoods and, quite possibly, their health. The nuclear accident was not on the agenda when US President Barack Obama met Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in January, despite assurances made by the American Secretary for Energy, Ernest Moniz, that he would personally ‘look into the matter in detail’. ‘The Spanish government has been negotiating with the Americans for years without success to return and get rid of the radiation threat,’ said 70-year-old Ken Lee, originally from Stock, near Chelmsford in Essex, who now lives near Palomares. ‘It’s alarming when more hot spots keep being found that blight the  land on which the farmers depend for their livelihood.’ His wife Carole, 71, added: ‘We’re disgusted at the way the Americans have been bullying the British over the Mexico oil spill disaster. ‘There’s little sign of that “special relationship” and no sign of President Obama fulfilling the promise to clean up the H-bomb mess in Palomares.’ Georgette Hurcomb, another local expat, who  is from Islington, North London, said: ‘America’s lack of effort to come and clean up the nuclear poison is a disgrace. Many farming families have given up and left because they’re banned from growing crops in certain areas.’ Indeed, the passage of time has  only made the problem more deadly still. Nearly five decades on, the plutonium has degraded to become americium, a substance that emits lethal alpha particles. ‘I would be very surprised if local people haven’t suffered already some increased risk of cancer, or leukaemia or lymphoma,’ explained British scientist Dr Christopher Busby. ‘They should be very concerned. ‘In 1966 it wasn’t appreciated how dangerous this stuff was. Then the emphasis was mainly on external radiation and gamma doses. But after years of research, we know that internal radioactive particles, like plutonium, are singularly hazardous.’ Dr Busby, who serves on the European Committee on Radiation Risk, said: ‘Hot particles would burn a hole through your gut causing colon or lung cancers, or if they were small enough would pass through the lymphatic system causing lymphomas and leukaemia.’ Environmentalists accuse Spanish and American scientists of secrecy about health checks among Palomares residents. Each year 150 are sent to Madrid for physical examinations. The Spanish government claims  only small levels of radiation have been detected though in several cases plutonium has attached itself to  their bones. ‘I think the public has a right to  know if this disaster has had consequences for their health,’ said Francisco Castejon, of Ecologists in Action. ‘The type of radiation now being emitted after almost 50 years is totally different.’ It is true that, back in the 1960s, America originally spent more than £10 million recovering the intact bombs from the Mediterranean and the dried-up river bed. The authorities shipped out 4,810 barrels of radioactive soil for burial at the Atomic Energy Commission headquarters in Charleston, South Carolina. More radiological ‘hot spots’ have recently been discovered around the village and sealed off, along with a large area right in the centre of the village and others by the local cemetery and in neighbouring Villaricos. In nearby foothills, where lettuce had been grown for many years, Spanish scientists have made a grim discovery. Masked and wearing protective clothing, they were drilling to establish whether alpha particles had leached underground into the water table. Instead they located two trenches 30ft wide and 100ft long emitting high radiation levels. They also found the area was contaminated with americium, the disintegrating product of plutonium. Buried here are thought to be remnants . of the two H-bombs that broke open and wreckage of the two planes that . collided and crashed. At . some point, and at massive expense, the debris will have to be dug up . and shipped across the Atlantic back to the United States as it should . have been in 1966. America . stands accused of secrecy about the location of the trenches. US . Department of Energy officials admit knowing about their existence, but . not exactly where they are, claiming no proper notes or maps were kept . back in the 1960s. Now the governments in Washington and Madrid continue to squabble over the best way forward. Scientists . from CIEMAT, the Spanish Centre for Energy, Environmental and . Technology Investigations, want a complex three- year plan that would . involve vacuum-sealed tents and compacting contaminated soil and debris . into bricks. The B-52 bomber from the Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, North Carolina, has been on global patrol over Europe loaded with ur 1.5 megaton Mark 28 thermonuclear hydrogen bombs when it collided with a tanker mid-air . It’s an operation that could cost more than £20 million. The Americans disagree, saying the fastest and most cost-effective solution would be to shovel the debris into barrels and ship them out for burial in South Carolina. But the scientists concede that once the land has been surgically cleaned, radiation will still persist and still have to be monitored.  Plutonium is one of the most toxic materials and as it degrades into americium it takes 24,400 years  for even half of a given amount  to dissipate. This is the reason why, since 1966, air monitors have been installed in and around Palomares, crops and animals are regularly examined, and why over 1,000 villagers have had to undergo more than 4,000 physical examinations. Although test results have never been made public, they reveal that five per cent of those screened by doctors are carrying plutonium in their bodies, which is attached to their bones. However, none of the villagers affected have been told about this, only that their annual medical check-ups are satisfactory. After 20 years, an estimated 75 per cent of the plutonium will remain in their bodies. The official view has always been that the population was exposed to only small levels of plutonium. There are suspicions, though, that some of those in the area died young after the H-bombs fell. Some farmers and their families have spoken about deaths from cancer and other mysterious illnesses following the accident. General Franco, the Spanish dictator, was in power at the time and medical records were destroyed or suppressed. He was enraged that the disaster should threaten what was then the country’s fledgling tourism industry. Today, two of the H-bombs, battered and bruised, rest in peace thousands of miles away at the US Atomic Museum in New Mexico, safely stripped of their lethal plutonium contents. The original decontamination involved 7,000 American troops who burned crops and scraped up three inches of topsoil. As is now all-too clear, however, the operation was far from complete. After almost half a century, Palomares’s nuclear nightmare is set to continue – for centuries to come.

"Britain has more rapists in jail than any other EU country, research shows. There were 5,408 prisoners serving rape sentences in England and Wales in 2013, compared to 3,600 in Germany, 2,287 in Spain and just 2,034 in Italy, a report by the Council of Europe reveals. The figures could be attributed to  tougher sentencing guidelines, higher reporting rates and more 'progressive' rape laws, according to women's charities. Leading: There were 5,408 prisoners serving rape sentences in England and Wales in 2013, compared to 3,600 in Germany, 2,287 in Spain and just 2,034 in Italy, a report by the Council of Europe reveals . The number of rapes in Britain hit a record high in 2013 - with more than 35 women attacked every day according to the latest official figures, released in October. While this accounts for between just 20 and 25 per cent of rapes committed,  the government claims - others place the estimate at 10 and 15 per cent -  it is still higher than other European countries. Reporting rates in Germany fall at roughly 11 per cent, according to a study published by the Criminological Research Institute of Lower Saxony, in Hanover, Germany, in 2011. While in Italy, 92 per cent of rapes are not reported to police, according to the 2009 UN Secretary-General’s Database on Violence against Women. This higher reporting rate in Britain means that there are more opportunities for the offenders to be prosecuted, convicted and jail - contributing to the larger number of rapists in jailed. Sarah Green, Acting Director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: 'The relatively high sentencing rate for the UK does not necessarily indicate that there are more rapists here. 'Progressive': The Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, said last month it was time to move past 'no means no' when investigating rape . 'Only about 10-15 per cent of rapes are reported to the police in the UK but this rate is still one of the highest in Europe and means more perpetrators are prosecuted and then sentenced.' Numbers of rape cases coming to court in the past two years in Britain have also risen by 30 per cent. Of the cases sent to prosecutors for trial in 2012/2013, around 60 per cent result in convictions. However, this represented a drop on 3 per cent from the previous year. Tougher sentencing guidelines are one of the reasons there could be a higher number of Britons jailed for rape than in other European countries. Between 2005 and 2011 - the most recent set of data available - there has been an increase of 20.1-month increase in the length of sentence for raping a woman. It is now more than eight years. The average sentence for raping a man rose by 28 months over the same period to more than eight years. Ms Green added that the law on rape in the UK, which based on a definition of the absence of consent, is 'clearer and more progressive than many other countries'. Last month, the Crown Prosecution Service announced a major overhaul to the way rape cases are investigated, saying it was time to move past 'no means no'. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, said she wanted police to ask suspects how they knew the alleged victim was saying yes, and was doing so 'freely and knowingly'. The CPS wants to tighten the law against offenders who target people incapacitated through drink or drugs, or where the alleged rapist holds a position of power over the victim. Questions on consent should also be raised where the complainant has mental health problems or learning difficulties, it was said. Tougher sentencing: Between 2005 and 2011 - the most recent set of data available - there has been an increase of 20.1-month increase in the length of sentence for raping a woman. (Above, file image) This means it can be more straightforward for the CPS to convict rapists - and increases the chance of them being sentenced to time in prison. Ms Green noted: 'Some other countires are still examining rape as though it must involve physical force and resistance for example which is not the case here.' But, she added: 'The fact is that the UK's reporting rates are still very low and we also still fail to ask the question about what survivors of rape want in terms of justice and for support services - there is no guarantee of long-term counselling and support here. There's a long way for all EU states to go.'","There were 5,408 rapists serving time in jail in England and Wales in 2013 .

"Towards the end of his press conference at Arena Corinthians yesterday, Louis van Gaal was asked by a presenter from children’s television whether he thought youngsters in Holland should be allowed to stay up for Wednesday's game against Argentina. Van Gaal can be an obtuse man but on this he was unequivocal. ‘I would always allow my children to watch the match because this is absolutely unique,’ said the  Holland coach. ‘Look at the impact of the World Cup at a global level - and this is a semi-final. VIDEO Scroll down for All Star XI: Lionel Messi highlights . Playful: Holland coach Louis van Gaal believes children should be allowed to stay up back home to watch the game . Ready: Holland face Argentina in the World Cup semi-final on Wednesday in Sao Paulo . ‘Most children are on holiday and they won’t sleep anyway because they will be so stressed and tense. I would strongly advise parents to let them watch the match.’ In Holland, they are just glad to have these decisions to make. This was supposed to be a World Cup of limited horizons for Van Gaal and his functional (his own word) team. Yet, here we are and the Dutch are still in town, preparing for a classic fixture to conjure memories of the 1978 final - won by Argentina in their own country - and a 1998 quarter-final, won by Holland in Marseille. Those games, of course, featured defining contributions by genuine superstars. Mario Kempes scored the opening goal in Buenos Aires while Dennis Bergkamp settled the meeting in France with perhaps the best goal of his stellar career in the final minute. Tonight in mild, damp Sao Paulo, we have the opportunity to witness greatness once again. The deposed World Footballer of the Year, Lionel Messi, has approached this month in Brazil as if intent on proving people were wrong to give this year’s title to Cristiano Ronaldo. So far, he has done a pretty reasonable job and without him Argentina would certainly no longer be here. Celebration: Dennis Bergkamp is overjoyed after scoring the winning goal against Argentina in 1998 . Plan: Van Gaal says that he has prepared the way to play against Argentina and Lionel Messi . Ball skills: Wesley Snejder in training ahead of Holland's World Cup semi-final with Argentina . Moving on up: Quarter-final penalty hero Tim Krul (centre) and Van Gaal (right) walk out for training . Even Messi, though, would struggle to shift Holland’s Arjen Robben as player of the tournament in most people’s minds. The Bayern Munich forward has taken his game to new levels in South America and it is perhaps not surprising that Argentina appear to be approaching this game with some rather rudimentary ideas about how to stop him. ‘We have to be aggressive, to show the passion of the Argentine players to the Dutch - and especially to Robben,’ said Manchester City defender Martin Demichelis. ‘He doesn’t like physical contact, so you have to make him feel it and get under his skin. He is a phenomenon but he’s not got much edge, he’s not a fighter. Therefore you have to attack him.’ Demichelis and Robben played together at Bayern in 2009-10. Maybe the South American hasn’t been watching his old club mate closely out here, however, as the Robben of summer 2014 has shown as much courage as any forward in this tournament. Last Saturday, four of Costa Rica’s back five were booked for crude, hacking fouls on Robben. Still, he strode forward. If Argentina are to stop him tonight, they will need to find a cuter way. ‘It’s ridiculous how much he is fouled,’ said Dutch midfielder Nigel de Jong. ‘They foul him because they can’t find another way. He is too good for most.’ VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi highlights . Dangerman: Van Gaal says that his team have a plan and must be prepared for Lionel Messi . Star: But in Arjen Robben Holland arguably have the player of the tournament so far . Stretch: Robben has shone in Brazil and has only got better as the tournament has progressed . It may seem rich to hear members of Holland’s derided 2010 World Cup final team moan about treatment afforded one of their own, given the way De Jong and others kicked the Spain midfield all over Johannesburg four years ago. Certainly, they will seek other ways to neutralise Messi on Wednesday. Van Gaal’s Holland are different in their approach from the team shaped by Bert van Marwijk and yesterday the current manager did his best to play down questions about Barcelona’s magician. ‘We are playing against Argentina and we always refer to teams and not individual players,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We have a plan ready for Argentina. We showed the players Argentina this morning. Messi was once elected best footballer in the world. There’s a reason for that. If you score so many goals, you have an added value. ‘At the most important stage he can always pull it off but in principle he’s always found it difficult to show that at an international level. He wants to do that at this tournament and we want to stop him doing that, so that’s going to be quite a challenge.’ Focused: The Holland squad train ahead of their World Cup semi-final with Argentina . Team talk: Van Gaal talks with his players during their training session in Sao Paulo . VIDEO Team Profile: Netherlands highlights . Dutch training contained some surprises on Tuesday as De Jong, struggling with a groin injury, joined in and Robin van Persie, who had a stomach bug, did not. We can expect the latter to start, however, and he is already looking ahead. ‘Playing against Argentina is not a dream,’ said Van Persie. ‘It doesn’t interest me at all. We just have to win. A dream is to grab hold of that cup.' Dutch confidence is clearly high. Parents in Amsterdam and beyond should perhaps start planning ahead because if they win they will face their rampant German rivals on Sunday.","Van Gaal believes children should be allowed to stay up by their parents in Holland and watch this 'absolutely unique' match .

"But it wasn’t a foul-mouthed hoodie that so intimidated the Tesco  workers – but a church-going grandmother of four. Christine Crow, 83, was banned for life from her local branch after bosses claimed she was a ‘bully’ who had rammed staff with her trolley. Grandmother Christine Crow wants an apology from Tesco for 'humiliating' her after they accused her of bullying their employees . Mrs Crow, a widow, was banned after she was frog-marched from the store by security staff. They claimed that following an . incident at the deli counter months earlier she had been verbally and . physically abusive on subsequent visits and had used a trolley ‘as a . weapon’ and intimidated staff. It is understood she is accused of targeting one employee on more than one occasion. Mrs Crow, who lives in the Birmingham suburb of Moseley, a mile from the store in Hall Green, denied the accusations and is now demanding an apology. She has complained about being snubbed by staff and humiliated. But Tesco is standing by its decision with one worker, who asked not to be named, claiming a colleague refused to go on the shopfloor while the pensioner was there. The pensioner was ushered from the premises by two managers and a security guard . 'It's a trumped-up charge,' protested Christine last night. 'Bullying? You must be joking. 'Admittedly, the trolleys can have a mind of their own. You bump into someone else's and apologise, but 'ramming' suggests a deliberate act.' The drama unfolded at the deli counter of the Stratford Road store months ago when Christine, originally from Yorkshire, spoke out over slow service. She admits being 'sharp'. 'I may have said, ""is there no one serving?"". 'I've served customers myself,' said the former school meals supervisor. 'You don't always like the customer, but you get on with it.' Relations between Christine and staff soured following that skirmish, though she denies berating workers or attacking them with her trolley. She was informed of the ban in December - when she was ushered from the store. 'It was very humiliating,' she told the Birmingham Mail. 'When they said I'd been banned for bullying staff, I replied, ""you must be joking."". 'People were walking past with eyebrows raised. They thought I was a shoplifter.' Christine had used the store for 15 years but is now getting her groceries from Waitrose, Hall Green. The pensioner said: 'I will never go to the Tesco store again, but I want an apology.' Her daughter Alison Walker, aged 54, has demanded to see in-store CCTV evidence of the trolley attacks from Tesco but it has not been provided. Not welcome: Christine had used the store for 15 years but is now getting her groceries from Waitrose . She admitted: 'Mom's born and bred in .

But a Tesco spokesperson said: 'The well-being of our colleagues is very important to us and we have spoken to our customer several times to make her aware that we cannot tolerate abusive behaviour. 'Decisions to ban customers from stores are not made lightly and follow a full investigation.

"The League Cup has always been used by Manchester United as a chance to showcase their academy graduates. And with Louis Van Gaal facing an injury crisis in defence ahead of Tuesday night's second round tie at MK Dons, a 22-year-old right-back called Marnick Vermijl could be pressed into action. But who is he? Here's our lowdown on the young Belgian. Name: Marnick Vermijl . Age: 22 . Club: Manchester United . Position: Right-back . Getting stuck in: Manchester United's Belgian right-back Marnick Vermijl (right) slides in on Liverpool's Kristoffer Peterson during last Friday's Under 21 Premier League encounter at Anfield . Why all the fuss? Van Gaal faces a bit of a headache as he makes his team selection for the tricky-looking trip to Milton Keynes as United enter the League Cup at the second round stage for the first time since 1995. Chris Smalling limped off with a groin injury in the first half of Sunday's Premier League draw at Sunderland and is unlikely to make it, while Rafael is also a doubt. New signing from Sporting Lisbon Marcos Rojo hasn't received his work permit in time to make his debut and so United are struggling a little for men at the back. Enter Vermijl, who could be in line to make his first United start in two years at stadium:mk, most likely alongside Jonny Evans and fellow academy graduate Michael Keane. Selection dilemma: Injury problems could force Louis Van Gaal to field an untried back line at MK Dons . Forced off: Chris Smalling picked up a groin strain in United's draw at Sunderland on Sunday . Too soon: New £16m signing Marcos Rojo hasn't received a work permit in time to play . The 22-year-old has waited some time since his United debut, which came on September 26, 2012 when he played 77 minutes in a League Cup tie with Newcastle United. It was a campaign in which Vermijl appeared in the United squad on other occasions - twice in the Champions League and at Chelsea in both the League Cup and FA Cup - but didn't gain any further time on the pitch. Now, having gained more experience during a season-long loan with Dutch side NEC Nijmegen, it looks as though he will have another chance to impress. What's his background? Vermijl was born on January 13, 1992 in Peer, a small town close to the Dutch border in the north of Belgium and joined the academy of Standard Liege at the age of 16. With United's scouting network well established in the Low Countries, Vermijl was picked out despite not making a senior appearance for the Belgian top flight side. His delighted dad revealed the news of his contract at Old Trafford in 2010, after a £250,000 compensation payment had been agreed with Liege. 'They said he was the best right or left-back they had seen in years,' Dirk Vermijl told Het Laatste Nieuws. Shadowed: Vermijl keeps a close check on Liverpool's Cameron Brannagan during the U21 game . '[Sir Alex] Ferguson told me that Marnick in the following years would become a fixture in the Manchester United squad.' Ferguson and then-reserve team coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had clearly seen potential in him, as they had in his compatriot Ritchie De Laet. And he made an immediate impression when he scored twice, playing in a more advanced position, in a pre-season friendly with Shamrock Rovers. Part of the attraction had been Vermijl's ability to play right across the back four, or even on the right side of midfield, but he quickly settled into the right-back role. He became a mainstay in United's reserve team during the 2010-2011 season and picked up a winners' medal in 2012 when United defeated Aston Villa on penalties. His consistent displays in the reserves led to Ferguson calling him up to the first-team squad for the first time in the League Cup last 16 tie at Aldershot on October 25, 2011. He didn't feature in the 3-0 win, however. The following season was another encouraging one for Vermijl, with his handful of first-team squad selections balanced with a leading role in United winning the inaugural Under 21 Premier League. He scored one and created another in the Old Trafford final against Tottenham, inspiring a United comeback from two goals down to win 3-2. Under 21 coach Warren Joyce shortlisted him for the club's Reserves' Player of the Year award, capping a fine year. Battler: Vermijl goes in for a challenge with Sheyi Ojo during the 1-1 draw at Anfield . Going Dutch . With the departure of Ferguson and the arrival of David Moyes at the start of last season, Vermijl was sent out on loan to NEC in Holland, where he was a regular starter at right-back. He performed well, with three league and one Cup goal during the season, which unfortunately culminated in relegation from the Eredivisie for the Nijmegen club. His performances resulted in a call-up to the Belgium Under 21 side, but Moyes seemed indifferent to the young player. In March, Vermijl's agent said his client's future would depend on whether Moyes remained at Old Trafford. 'If the manager stays, then it does not look good because he let Marnick go quite easily to NEC. 'If Moyes is sacked, it may open greater chances.' As we all know, Moyes was shown the door and Vermijl, who has one year left on his contract, is back in the frame at United, with Van Gaal keen to assess what he can do. He played a full 90 minutes in the Under 21 side's 1-1 draw with Liverpool at Anfield last week and could now be set for another first-team chance, especially if the injury crisis worsens. Where does he play? As mentioned, Vermijl is a right-back, or the right-sided operator in Van Gaal's hallmark 3-5-2 formation. But in his younger days, he was more of a forward or a winger and so isn't afraid to get forward in support of the midfield if necessary. One of his main attractions when United first signed him was his versatility and, if required, Vermijl could slot in right across the back line. Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page. Out on loan: Vermijl spent last season with Dutch club NEC Nijmegen to gain experience . Strengths and weaknesses . Vermijl is well-regarded for his consistency and, in the Dutch league at least, was seldom found wanting by speedy wingers. If beaten, he possesses the pace to recover position and is a reliable winner of the ball in the tackle. During his campaign in Holland, he received just one booking. If he is to be part of Van Gaal's team, he'll have to show quality going forward and he does have a decent quick-step to get beyond defenders and a fairly good cross. One thing that was exposed in the Eredivisie, however, was his passing, with too many balls going astray. International honours? Yes, Vermijl has been capped by Belgium at every level from Under 17 to Under 21. In all, he has 43 caps for Belgium across the various standards and has scored five times.","Injury problems could hand Marnick Vermijl a start at right-back for Manchester United in their Capital One Cup tie at MK Dons .

Hammered: Scolari speaks to his team after their 7-1 hammering . Distraught: Brazil fans at the stadium in Belo Horizonte stand in disbelief . What a . vanishing act this was, with Julio Cesar, Maicon, captain David Luiz, . Dante and Marcelo turning in one for the worst performances at the . highest level in living memory.

And . where was Dante, where was Marcelo or Maicon as Germany put on the full . programme during this extraordinary performance?  The answer is . absolutely nowhere. Dante, . mild-mannered and elegant when he pulls on the shirt of Bayern Munich, . looked like a man who hadn’t played since a 4-0 win over Panama on June . 3. In . fact he gave the impression of a man who had never played the . game at all when Miroslav Klose, Kroos and Sami Khedira added to . the scoreline. Emotional: David Luiz unable to hold back the tears following full time . No hiding place: Marcelo reacting after full time . VIDEO Disbelief in Belo Horizonte after devastating Germany win . In . many ways, what with the shrine to Neymar Junior - ForzaNeymar 10 . baseball caps in his honour, a shirt held up by David Luiz with his name . on - they really asked for this. Behave yourself, Brazil. They . were lost in the moment, failing to pay attention to the job in hand . and that was to reach the final against Holland or Argentina. ‘Seven . steps to heaven’ Scolari had called it. Well they got to the sixth and . only hell will await them after this semi-final shambles. The . target was to win the World Cup and a embroider a sixth gold star on . that beautiful yellow jersey. There are some dark days ahead indeed for . Brazil now. Big Phil Scolari - Felipao - will pay the price. He will be sacked by the CBF for this shameful semi-final exit. Scolari, . a World Cup winner himself with the 2002 vintage, cannot escape the . blame for this disastrous performance. He is finished. On . the eve of the game he had lightened the mood by revealing that Luiz, . one of the team jokers, often mimics the coach during team meetings. Embrace: Miroslav Klose, who grabbed the second for Germany, consoling Luis Gustavo . Brace: Toni Kroos scored the third and fourth on the night . High five: Sami Khedira puts Germany 5-0 up before half an hour . Abject: Brazil's defending was non-existent all night . First to every ball: Brazil's team were off the pace all night . It is fair to say that no-one wants to be in Scolari’s shoes now. He . should be wondering what on god’s earth he was doing when he presented . Joachim Low with a CBF ‘goodie bag’ before the national anthems were . played. Low looked at him with utter bemusement. It . was toe-curling to watch them concede five times inside 29 mental . minutes at the Estadio Mineairo and yet this could have all been . avoided. Had . that back four, players who have Champions League pedigree with Real . Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Inter Milan, remained at their . stations and stayed in position the score would have been 0-0 at . half-time. Instead . they hared around the stadium, losing their minds and this game even . before Thomas Muller struck Germany’s opening goal in the 11th minute. Finisher: Andre Schurle, who scored Germany's final two, consoles his Chelsea team-mate Oscar . Contrast: Scolari with triumphant Germany coach Joachim Low . Those . boys have enough experience to know that the race isn’t won in the . opening laps and yet they lost their discipline, shape and, with it, the . game. It was embarrassing and pitiful. Luiz’s . performance brought back Gary Neville’s ‘PlayStation footballer’ analogy, the comment that made the former Chelsea defender mad.  Well . Neville got it right because the stand-in captain was all over the shop. There . is the mild temptation to argue that playing on the right side of . Brazil’ s defence, instead of his preferred left, because of Thiago . Silva’s suspension was somehow to blame. This . was a performance of shock and awe by Germany, a ruthless exhibition of . flair and fantasy as they chase their first World Cup win since 1990. They will take some stopping now, that much is clear. To be 5-0 up inside 29 minutes of a World Cup semi-final in the host’s backyard is really something quite radical. After this, Brazil just lost a lot of respect.","Brazil beaten 7-1 by Germany in World Cup semi-final .

"A New York City plastic surgeon pleaded guilty to killing a former model during a botched liposuction procedure on Wednesday in return for only two-months behind bars. Dr. Oleg Davie, 53, ignored the medical records of Isel Pineda which showed she'd undergone a heart transplant in 2004 performed by TV's Dr. Oz and falsified forms after her death to cover up his mistakes prosecutors said. The disgraced surgeon pleaded guilty to a charge of criminally negligent homicide and falsifying records after originally being charged with manslaughter for Pineda's death in 2012 which would have carried a prison term of up to 15 years. Death: Isel Pineda should never have been on the operating table having had the transplant in in 2004, making it unsafe for her to be given anesthesia . Pineda, 51, paid $3,200 for the procedure, described in online ads as being to 'lose the wobble'. She went into cardiac arrest before leaving Davie's office. Paramedics tried to revive her but she was declared dead at Coney Island Hospital. Guilty: Oleg Davie, 52, pleaded guilty to a charge of criminally negligent homicide . 'You knew she had a heart condition but you performed the surgery anyway, didn’t you?' prosecutor Patrick Cappock asked in Brooklyn Supreme Court. 'Yes,' Davie answered. According to The New York Post, Davie, who surrendered his medical license last year, was unapologetic to the victim's family when he left the courtroom on Wednesday. 'What happened here is tragic but not criminal,' said his lawyer, James DiPietro, who added that the deal was 'inherently fair'. He noted that his client would have faced 15-years behind bars if he had decided to fight a manslaughter charge. Instead he admitted to changing Pineda's records after she died and admitted he did not speak to her cardiologist despite knowing she had undergone a heart procedure. Davie, who was on probation at the time of Pineda's surgery for 'professional misconduct' deleted all mention of her heart transplant and medication after the unsuccessful SmartLipo operation. Paperwork found in Pineda's purse by her boyfriend suggested Davie knew about her heart disease and resulting life-saving operation that made her unsuitable for liposuction. Tragedy: Isel Pineda died before she left Dr. Davie's New York City practice in 2012 . On it were details of the diagnosis and the anti-rejection rejection drugs she was taking. 'This woman should not have been operated on — period,' a top plastic surgeon told the New York Post. 'You don’t screw around with people like this. If he knew she had a heart transplant, he should have shown her the door.' Davies appeared to have ignored the health issues when filling out Pineda's patient history form, on which he clearly marked 'no' where it asks whether she had ever been hospitalized. Heartbreak: 'She was stunning. She would walk into a room and the music would stop,' said Pineda's ex-husband . He wrote that she had a 'mid-chest, old, well healed' scar, describing it as resulting from 'skin surgery' to remove a 'cyst'. Pineda's scar would have stretched from the neck to her navel. And while her family believe she didn't tell them she was having lipo due to embarrassment, she was never shy about discussing her heart transplant. Last year her ex-husband, Jeffrey Mayer said, 'She was stunning. She would walk into a room and the music would stop,” adding that seeing Davie “brought all the pain and all the realness back.'","Dr. Oleg Davie pleaded guilty Wednesday to reduced charges after facing 15 years for manslaughter .

"Submerged in deep water, one of the last things a diver may expect to find 90ft below the surface is a river view. But that's exactly what awaits those bold enough to dive in Mexico's Cenote Angelita. The eerie landscape of swirling mist looks like a flowing river in the middle of the cave, complete with trees emerging from the surface. Deep below the surface on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula lies a secret tree-lined river flowing in a water-filled cave . The Cenote Angelita - which translates as 'little angel' - is a diver's delight, but can only be attempted by advanced scuba divers . The swirling mist looks like a river marks the bottom of a 90ft pit - but it's merely the halfway point in a difficult dive . The phenomenon can only be seen in person by extremely skilled scuba divers who can cope with exploring the depths of the 180ft pit. For those who aren't, photographer Anatoly Beloshchin filmed his exploration of the cenote - a cave created by the collapse of limestone bedrock which then fills with water - to show the drama of the moment the river comes into sight. Angelita, which translates as 'little angel', lies about a ten-minute drive from the Maya city Tulum, on the east coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. Cenotes were often used by the Maya for sacrifices and Angelita has certainly retained its mystique to the present day. For the first 90ft of the dive, adventurers are swimming through fresh water with a clear view of the inside of their surroundings before the 'river' appears below. The mist is actually a thick layer of . hydrogen sulfide, about 6ft deep, which is caused by the clash between . the fresh water at the top of the cave and the salt water that fills the . bottom half. The trees and discarded branches emerge from the depth, but are sitting atop a pile of rubble left when limestone bedrock collapsed to create the cenote . Divers can swim along the 'river' or be more daring and make their way through the cloud of hydrogen sulfide into the salt water below . The scenes, captured by diver and photographer Anatoly Beloshchin, easily look like a secluded forest instead of the middle of a water-filled cave . The chemical compound is often created when the . bacterial breakdown of organic matter happens when there's no oxygen . around and dissolves, according to BookYourDive. It looks like the end of the journey but is only the halfway point of the exploration. Divers can switch on their lights and find their way through the relatively short distance before emerging into the salt water. Those who weren't aware that the pictures were taken underwater could easily believe they were looking at a secluded spot in the middle of a forest. The trees and branches lie on top of the collapsed rubble which fills nearly half of the pit, leaving a narrow passage down the side. Mr Beloshchin said: 'Under me I see a river, island and fallen leaves… Actually, the river, which you can see, is a layer of hydrogen sulfide.' Cenote Angelita was formed by a rock collapse which created the 180ft pit containing fresh water and salt water, as well as the river effect of the hydrogen sulfide . The cave can be found a short drive from the Maya city Tulum on the east coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula .","The Cenote Angelita, which translates as 'little angel', reveals what looks like a river winding through a forest to divers .

"He's the Australian jihadist who, in between swearing to cleanse the world of infidel non-believers, apparently sees a lighter side in the Islamic State's barbaric war. Zia Abdul-Haq, a militant from Logan, south of Brisbane, who is fighting for IS in the Middle East, has purportedly posted a series of videos on YouTube with titles such as 'funny terrorist video part 1' - as well as Twitter images of militants cuddling cats, playing video games and training with assault weaponry. Terrorism experts said the often jokey social media posts proved the immaturity of some Westerners who have taken up arms fighting for the so-called 'caliphate'. Scroll down for video . Pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State (IS): Zia Abdul-Haq, from Brisbane, is pictured in a variety of social media posts. '#Mujahid crime! The cat love this young #French mujahid': Abdul-Haq posted this sarcastic caption alongside this picture of a purported French jihadist patting a small cat. Down time? Abdul-Huq captioned this image, of apparent militants wearing military fatigues, as 'jihadists having fun =)'. Their location is unknown. Abdul-Haq, who also goes by the name Abu Yusseph, has posted a number of images making light of IS's sinister reputation. A picture of a French IS fighter stroking a cat is captioned sarcastically: '#IS crime! The cat love this young mujahid (fighter)'. In another, he mocks the idea IS is cruel by showing fighters cutting up a dead animal and labelling them 'IS crimes'. Two militants are seen horsing around in Abdul-Haq's 'funny terrorist' video series, with one militant mimicking one of U.S. President Barack Obama's video greetings to the global Islamic community. But some of the material is much more chilling. 'Every #IS #mujahid needs to carry a big knife for slaughtering the enemies. It's more fun to slaughter :-)', reads one of Abdul-Haq's posts. 'May our blood become a flood to clean this world from all types of (non-believers)', said another. And while there is little evidence he has actively fought in the conflict zone, one message represented threatened Australian troops: 'Media propaganda is only to prepare the way for Australia and the West to send troops to fight , we hope to give them a good welcome'. Professor Greg Barton, from the Global Terrorism Research Centre at Monash University, said Abdul-Haq's posts showed that many IS fighters were 'juveniles' who did not understand the gravity of what they were doing. Pretending to be Barack Obama: With his head covered by black cloth, militants are caught on camera imitating the U.S. President. The videos were posted to YouTube by an account purported to belong to Abdul-Haq. 'Funny terrorist part2': The straight to the point caption on Abdul-Haq's apparent YouTube video. Weaponry: This image of ammunition and an assault weapon is one of many pictures posted to social media by the jihadist. 'Training': The militants. Few images are posted where any of the militants' faces are evident . The Abbott government revealed last month that it feared around 60 Australians were  fighting in the Middle East. 'For the most part, they're young idiots,' Prof Barton told Daily Mail Australia. 'We're dealing with young men doing foolish things, driven by peer pressure and a desire for affirmation.' He compared it to teenagers posting images on Facebook in order to attract high numbers of 'likes'. He said the militants posted jokes - and gruesome material - to get attention. 'I think it's generally true for (their) social media posts that what we see reflects a fairly juvenile mentality,' he said. 'There's not a lot of deep reflection on religious themes or agonising over moral choices'. Ali Kadri, a spokesman for the Holland Park mosque which Abdul-Haq occasionally visited for Friday prayers, told Daily Mail Australia Abdul-Haq did not appear to have an aggressive personality. 'He wasn't that kind of person. I remember him as a shy, quiet kind of person'. In recent months, the Islamic State - which is also known by the names ISIS and ISIL - has not hesitated in showing the gruesome lengths it is willing to go to in prosecuting its war. In the past month, the group's media arm has released videos depicting the beheadings of two Western journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Australian militants Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar also sparked international condemnation after they distributed images of themselves - and Sharrouf's seven-year-old child - brandishing the heads of decapitated Syrian fighters. Gruesome: The Islamic State have released videos of two U.S. journalists being beheaded in the past month. Khaled Sharrouf's seven-year-old son, pictured wielding a head. Abdul-Haq, who also goes under the identity of Abu Yussuph, has in recent days tweeted about how 'proud' he is to fight for the Islamic State. 'I never been part of any group / organisation in Australia or anywhere else, but I am proud to be part of #IslamicState', he said. Abdul-Haq also denied claims he was 'brainwashed' by Australian preacher Musa Cerantonio into taking up arms for the Islamic State, labelling them 'media lies'. 'No one brainwashed me,' Yusseph wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. 'Don't believe media'. Cerantonio said the allegation was unsubstantiated. Abdul-Haq did not respond to a request for an interview. In July, Cerantonio was arrested by Philippine authorities and deported to Australia, just weeks after he tweeted that he had arrived in the Middle East to join his brothers in the Islamic State. 'Al-Hamdulillah I have arrived in the land of Khilafah in Ash-Sham! May Allah honor all Muslims during this blessed time with His obedience,' he posted on Twitter at the time. On August 17, Abdul-Haq posted an image of fighters in the Middle East watching a video of Cerantonio. 'Mujahideen (warriors) in Ash-Shaam watching Musa Cerantonio's talks #IS #ISIS #jihadist #caliphate #Khilafah'. Cerantonio was approached for comment.

"Manchester United’s £59.7million signing Angel di Maria is set to break the British transfer record. It’s a switch far removed from the one which took Alf Common south from Sunderland to Middlesbrough in 1905, for the then princely sum of £1,000. Common was British football’s first grand star and he was the country’s most expensive player for six years. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cristiano Ronaldo flick Angle di Maria the V in training . Transfer: Angel di Maria's transfer from Real Madrid to Manchester United will become a new record . It took 23 years for the first player to cost £10,000 when David Jack – a scorer in the first FA Cup final at Wembley – moved from Bolton to Arsenal. The magic £100,000 barrier wasn’t broken until the early 1960s, when Denis Law returned to England from Italy, with United paying £115,000 for the striker. Trevor Francis became football’s first million pound player in 1979 as he joined Nottingham Forest from Birmingham City. However, despite scoring a European Cup final winner he never quite settled at the City Ground and was later shipped off to Manchester City for another hefty fee. Thanks a million: Trevor Francis (left) was the first £1m British player and scored a European Cup-winning goal . Midfielders such as Bryan Robson and Roy Keane have been the subjects of the record transfer fee but it is generally strikers for whom the big bucks are paid. But that was blown out of the water in 1996 when Alan Shearer joined his boyhood club Newcastle United from Blackburn Rovers for a staggering £15m. Just five years later, this record was nearly doubled as Argentina midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron signed for Manchester United from Lazio. He was one of the stars of the world game but, after a lively start at Old Trafford, flopped spectacularly. Talk of the Toon: Alan Shearer broke the record in 1996 when Newcastle paid £15m for him . Record: When Chelsea paid £50m for Fernando Torres he beat the old record by more than £10m . In 2002, Sir Alex Ferguson broke the record once more at United and this signing was a big shock in terms of positioning as centre half Rio Ferdinand was bought from Leeds United for just over £29million. Andriy Shevchenko became British football’s first £30m signing in 2006 but possibly the most surprising fee paid for any player was the £35m forked out by Liverpool for Andy Carroll in 2011. His record at Anfield never came close to justifying the fee. It may be a blessing for Carroll that he held the record for a matter of hours as later on that same January day, Fernando Torres joined Chelsea for £50m. It has become a symbol of the folly of spending big towards the end of a transfer window. United must be hoping Di Maria ends up more like a Cole or a Shearer than a Carroll or a Torres.

"All the challenges for Vincenzo Nibali were overcome well before he arrived in Paris on Sunday evening to be crowned Tour de France winner. Traditionally a sprinters’ stage, the finale on the Champs-Élysées was little more than a celebration for Nibali, or eight laps of honour, at the end of which Germany’s Marcel Kittel claimed his fourth win ahead of Norway’s Alexander Kristoff. Over the three weeks Nibali comprehensively dominated, and might have done so even if Chris Froome and Alberto Contador had not crashed out.

"Michael Shenton will relaunch his international career as a 'more rounded player' when England get the 2014 Four Nations Series under way this weekend. The Castleford centre wondered if he would ever get the chance to play on the international stage again after his last tour was cruelly cut short by an ankle-ligament injury sustained in the opening game. Shenton was forced to fly home early from the 2010 Four Nations Series in New Zealand and he missed the following year's tournament with an elbow injury sustained in the Grand Final. Michael Shenton is tackled by New Zealand forward Simon Mannering during the 2010 Four Nations Series . That came during a largely forgettable spell at St Helens and it took a return to his home-town club to get his career back on track. The Tigers skipper forced his way back into the thoughts of England coach Steve McNamara after rediscovering his sparkling form during his club's landmark season in which they reached Wembley and went within one game of topping the league for the first time in their 88-year history. However, Shenton, now 28, will be forgiven if his mind wonders back to the events of four years ago when he runs out for his 10th cap against Samoa at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium on Saturday. 'It came to an end pretty bad,' he recalled. 'I thought it was going all right out there as well. Shenton has thrived under the guidance of coach Darryl Powell at the Castleford Tigers this season . 'We played the Maoris in the first weekend, then the Kiwis down in Wellington and I did it there. It was not a good feeling to be honest. 'Once your chance like that goes, you wonder if you'll ever get another. The next year I did my elbow in the Grand Final and there are some really good young players coming through in the position I'm playing so it's been a long road back.' Playing for England was the last thing on Shenton's mind back in February as he and coach Daryl Powell set about trying to prove the critics wrong for writing off Castleford's Super League play-off chances but before long he found himself being asked about his international prospects. 'I had so much on with the club, I didn't think about it too much at the start of the year,' he said. 'It was totally at the back of my mind but I spoke to Daryl about it and he said it should be a goal of mine. 'He worked on my game and it paid off. It was awesome to get back in the training squad in mid-season and then I got told about six weeks ago when they were going to name the squad. 'Leading into that week, our season had already been finished and I was pretty nervous. I was thinking 'I'd love to go on tour' and I would have been really disappointed not to get in. The elation and relief was pretty special. It's great to get another crack at it. 'I think I'm a better player all-round to be honest.

"The Obama administration conceded on Thursday that its vaunted Affordable Care Act enrollment numbers from last year were inflated by a whopping 400,000. That's how many dental insurance plans were included in the final number when the White House boasted in September that 7.3 million Americans had signed up for medical insurance through government-managed marketplaces. The dental plans should not have been lumped into the overall total because they represented people who also had purchased medical insurance, effectively double-counting them. Including the dental policies was a break from previous practice that Republicans suspect was a scheme to push the administration's numbers over the 7 million mark. That the number the Congressional Budget Office had projected would be needed in order to keep the program financially viable. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told Congress in September that 7.3 million Americans had medical insurance through Obamacare, but 400,000 of that total was quietly double-counted by including dental plans . Rep. Darrell Issa (right) presides over the powerful House Oversight Committee, which uncovered the numerical sleight-of-hand on Thursday . Trouble in Washington: The Obamacare law is increasingly unpopular, according to a recent Gallup poll . Staff investigators at the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee uncovered the ruse, which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quickly called an honest mistake. CMS spokesman Aaron Albright confirmed the White House's use of creative math on Thursday. In May the administration had claimed more than 8 million people enrolled in Obamacare plans during the open-enrollment period that ended March 31. That number later fell to 6.9 million after more than 1 million were dropped from the rolls – some because they never paid their premiums, and others because they couldn't prove their legal resident status. With the 400,000 dental plans added in, the administration had the 7 million it needed for PR purposes, and to keep skeptical GOP opponents at bay. 'Faced with large numbers of Americans running for an exit from Obamacare, instead of offering the public an accurate accounting, the Administration offered numbers that obscured and downplayed the number of dropouts,' said House Oversight Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican. 'Now they’re saying this was just a ""mistake."" The claim that this was only [an] accident stretches credulity. The administration misreported Obamacare’s enrollment figures not once, but twice.' The news that the White House may have cooked Obamacare's books comes at an awkward time, after a series of videos surfaced depicting Jonathan Gruber, the law's architect, explaining how Democrats used deception to get it past Congress. In one video he credited 'the stupidity of the American voter' for the success of a ruse that recast large tax increases as penalties on insurance companies. Those costs are passed through to customers, rendering the result the same as if it were officially a tax. Second time's the charm? Obamacare is open for enrollment again through March 31 . Economist Jonathan Gruber, Obamacare's main architect, was caught on video candidly discussing the level of deception the Administration needed in order to pass the law in Congress . Former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Holtz-Eakin told Bloomberg that 'the No. 1 most effective message against the Affordable Care Act is [that] they lied to you to get it through.' 'People believe that years now after its passage. The distrust is already there, and they’re doing nothing but exacerbate it.' Issa, who will hand over his committee gavel to Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz in January, demanded action. 'HHS must provide a clear and detailed account of who knew about this decision and when they knew it,' he said in a statement. 'This administration still appears to be calling its Obamacare transparency plan from the Jonathan Gruber playbook: dismissing the American public’s right to know with the same deceptive arrogance that helped them pass the bill in the first place.' On September 18, CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner told the Oversight Committee that her agency had '7.3 million Americans enrolled in the health insurance marketplace coverage.' Five days later Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told a Brookings Institute audience that '7.3 million people signed up for marketplace plans, paid their premiums, and have access to affordable care.'","Official Obamacare numbers showed 7.3 million signups but that included 400,000 dental insurance customers who had never been counted in the total before .
Actual enrollment dropped from 8 million to 6.9 million when more than 1 million couldn't prove their legal status or failed to pay their premiums .
CBO had said the administration would need 7 million customers in the first year to keep Obamacare afloat financially .
With the numbers fudged, the White House had the total it needed in order to put Republicans on defense and claim victory with voters ."
"By LUCY ELKINS . Do you know a health hero? The Daily Mail, in partnership with Boots and ITV's This Morning, is asking you to nominate special people in the health-care sector  who have made a real difference to your life or a loved one's. To nominate your health hero, click here . Here, LUCY ELKINS tells one nominee’s story... Sitting beside her husband Peter as he slipped in and out of consciousness, Kay Hutchinson struggled to think clearly. Peter, 64, had had bone-marrow cancer for the past four years, but suddenly his condition had taken a rapid turn for the worse. Grateful: GP Janet Walker, left, has always been there for Kay and her family . He’d been at home for three weeks following a five-month spell in hospital - during which time his health had rallied. But overnight he'd become so ill that he'd stopped responding to Kay's voice. 'He was sleepy then he wouldn't wake up at all,' recalls Kay, 64, from Middlesbrough. 'I didn't know what to do for him or how to cope. It was frightening being on my own with him when he was so unwell.' To her huge relief, the couple's GP,  Dr Janet Walker, turned up unexpectedly at their front door. She had been making frequent out-of-hours visits to keep an eye on Peter, and on that particular day last October she'd popped by after surgery had finished for the morning. In fact, Dr Walker had been on hand, day and night, to help the couple cope with several major traumas over the past decade - including the sudden death of their only daughter when she was just 30 years old. Here she was again to give medical help and emotional support when they needed it most. Dr Walker examined Peter and explained that he was suffering from dehydration. Because Kay felt too worried to keep him at home, the GP said she'd get him into hospital to be put on a drip. Not only that but she'd try and get him on a ward at the town's James Cook University Hospital, where he was known by staff - not on an impersonal general admission ward. Kay says: 'Nothing is too much trouble for Dr Walker. She told me she would go to the surgery and sort it out and come back.' Despite the fact the part-time GP should have finished work for the day, she returned and stayed with Kay for six hours while they waited for an ambulance to take Peter to hospital. 'She talked to me throughout,' says Kay. 'I was sitting on the sofa, crying, and she sat on the floor in front of me holding my hand. If she hadn't been there, I don't know what I would have done. Beyond the call of duty: Dr Walker has helped Kay through some tough times . 'She has the most wonderful, calm manner. As soon as she came into the house, I felt supported and able to cope again. She told me, ""You know he's very poorly Kay."" She was trying to gently prepare me for the end. 'We had no way of knowing when a hospital bed would become available or when the ambulance would come but Dr Walker told me not to worry - she would stay with me. 'She was here a very, very long time, and at one point she said, ""Do you mind if I just phone home to let my family know I’m OK?""' Dr Walker waited with Kay until the ambulance arrived at 8pm. 'Then she gave me her home number and said, ""I'm on holiday next week but if you need anything just call me."" ...She listened to us and talked to us for . ages. I was crying and she got up and gave me a big hug and told us she . was there for us if we needed anything . 'I was amazed and touched. I called her on the Sunday and she was absolutely lovely and answered all of my concerns.' It was, says Kay, typical of the care Dr Walker offers her patients. Kay remembers when, eight years ago, her daughter Lisa died inexplicably of a pulmonary embolism  - a blood clot in the lungs - and Dr Walker went out of her way to support Kay and Peter. 'Nothing prepares you for the pain of losing a child,' says Kay. 'Just six weeks after Lisa died, Peter was due to have heart surgery but we thought it all might be too much for us so we went to see Dr Walker to discuss whether we could delay it. 'She was lovely and took a long time with us. Then she called us at about 8pm, long after she should have gone home - to talk to us some more about how we were feeling and to tell us why she didn't think the surgery should be delayed. Unsung heroes: Nominate your medical saviour . 'She asked us to come back the next week so that she could see how we were. And she told us to make the appointment for when the surgery had closed, so we could go in when it was empty rather than sitting in a room full of people, as she knew we were still so upset. 'She listened to us and talked to us for ages. I was crying and she got up and gave me a big hug and told us she was there for us if we needed anything.' Then, four years ago, when Peter was diagnosed with cancer - a type called multiple myeloma - Dr Walker emphasised she was there for the couple whenever they needed her - not just when the surgery was open. 'When we found out Peter had cancer, I was in pieces and couldn't stop weeping,' says Kay, who has a son, Paul, now 41. 'Seeing how upset we were, Dr Walker said we should go back after the surgery had closed, so she would have the time to take us through what would happen next.' During the next few years, Peter was treated by a number of 'fantastic' nurses and doctors - 'but none as outstanding as Dr Walker', says Kay. 'She has such compassion, and that type of kindness makes a big difference when you are going through the pain that we were at that time.' ...I am Evelyn's full-time carer and I get . on and do it, but it's a lot to cope with and I don't know what I would . do without Dr Walker . After being admitted to hospital for dehydration last October, Peter, a former process operator for the oil industry, was transferred to a hospice. Yet even though he was out of Dr Walker's care, she still checked on the couple. 'She kept ringing us at the hospice to see how we were, which was very, very comforting,' says Kay. Peter died on November 20, and Dr Walker phoned Kay as soon as she heard. 'She's never off-duty - you know she really does care,' says Kay. It's for these reasons that Kay has nominated Dr Walker for a Daily Mail Health Hero award. And Kay's not the only patient who's been overwhelmed by the GP's compassion and dedication. Jacqueline Jowsey, 75, who’s had several major health problems, including a heart attack and failing kidneys, says: 'It is so amazing how Dr Walker bothers  to keep tabs on you. She has  even called me at 9pm to see how I’m doing.' Three years ago, when Jacqueline had heart surgery, she was told by the hospital's nurses that 'Dr Walker was always ringing to make sure everything was OK'. Her surgery's hours are 8am-6pm but she often sees patients well outside these times. Colin Robinson, 82, whose wife Evelyn is ill with cancer and has had two strokes, says: 'Dr Walker often calls us in the evening to see how things are, and she'll pop in on her way home to check we are OK. You'll never hear her say she hasn't got time. 'I am Evelyn's full-time carer and I get on and do it, but it's a lot to cope with and I don’t know what I would do without Dr Walker. She is an amazing doctor. 'She will sit down and talk to us, all the time holding Evelyn's hand - making her and me feel much more reassured.' Despite being so highly praised by her patients, Dr Walker - who is 43 and married with a 13-year-old daughter - insists she does 'nothing unusual'. Talking to her, it's clear to see why her patients admire her - her soothing, warm manner shines through. She tells me: 'It's deeply flattering that Kay has nominated me for this award - but really I just do my job. 'Yes, I spent a lot of time with her when we were waiting for her husband to go into hospital, but I couldn't have left her.' But Kay, who deeply misses Peter, says: 'You do get through these things - you somehow find the strength - but I don't think I would have coped if it hadn’t been for the support of Dr Walker. 'Without her this would have been so much worse. She's not just a GP - she's a woman with such a very big heart.'","Do you know a health hero?

"Incredibly-resilient fish have been found living in perpetual darkness beneath a 2,430ft (740 metre) thick sheet of Antarctic ice. Stunned scientists made the discovery after drilling a small hole through the Ross Ice Shelf, which covers an area the size of France. They spotted the sea creatures in an area of remote seawater 33ft (10 metres) deep, sealed between the ice sheet and the seafloor. Scroll down for video . Resilient fish have been found living in darkness beneath a 2,430ft (740 metre) thick sheet of Antarctic ice . 'I'm surprised,' Ross Powell, a  glacial geologist from Northern Illinois University told Douglas Fox at Scientific American. 'You get the picture of these areas having very little food, being desolate, not supporting much life.' The discovery of fish in waters -2°C and perpetual darkness poses new questions about the ability of life to thrive in extreme environments. The expedition had initially wanted to analyse the stability of the Whillans Ice Stream, which is one of about a half-dozen large, fast-moving rivers of ice pouring from the West Antarctic. The discovery of fish in waters -2°C and perpetually dark poses new questions about the ability of life to thrive in extreme environments. 'You get the picture of these areas having very little food, being desolate, not supporting much life,' Ross Powell, a geologist from Northern Illinois University told  Scientific American . Pictured is the drilling site. The expedition had initially wanted to analyse the stability of the Whillans Ice Stream, which is one of about a half-dozen large, fast-moving rivers of ice pouring from the West Antarctic . When ice drillers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln peered beneath the region, they initially didn't believe it could hold life. But over several hours, they spotted 20 to 30 fish and lowered a camera into the area to capture their discovery. The fish had a bluish-brownish-pinkish, were roughly 15cm long with internal organs showing through translucent bodies. 'It was clear they were a community living there,' Proessor Powell says, 'not just a chance encounter.' The team encountered two other types of smaller fish - one black and another orange. They also found red, shrimp crustaceans, as well as some other marine invertebrates. Researchers suspect one source of food for the fish is plankton which can be grown in the waters of the Ross Sea and then swept under the ice shelf over a period of six or seven years. Stunned scientists made the discovery after drilling a small hole through the Ross Ice Shelf, which covers an area the size of France. They spotted the sea creatures in an area of remote seawater 33ft (10 metres) deep, sealed between the ice sheet and the seafloor below . Researchers suspect one source of food for the fish is plankton which can be grown in the waters of the Ross Sea (pictured) and then swept under the ice shelf over a period of six or seven years . Chemical energy from inside interior, rather than sunlight, could also be sustaining bacteria and other microbes which the fish feed on. The team are currently in the process of analysing the fish to understand more about their species. 'I have been investigating these types of environments for much of my career, and although I knew it would be difficult, I had been wanting to access this system for years because of its scientific importance,' said Professor Powell. 'Findings such as these - gaining an understanding of the ice sheet dynamics and its interaction with ocean and sediment, as well as establishing the structure of its ecosystem - are especially rewarding. It's a big pay-off in delayed gratification.' Researchers lowered this robolab complete with drill  through two miles of ocean and bored through several hundred feet of ocean sediment and into the rock where the aquifer flows . Two miles below the surface of the ocean, researchers have discovered new microbes that 'breathe' sulphate. The microbes, which have yet to be classified and named, exist in massive undersea aquifers — networks of channels in porous rock beneath the ocean where water continually churns, researchers say. About one-third of the Earth's biomass is thought to exist in this largely uncharted environment. 'It was surprising to find new bugs, but when we go to warmer, relatively old and isolated fluids, we find a unique microbial community,' said Alberto Robador, of USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, who led the study. Sulphate is a compound of sulfur and oxygen that occurs naturally in seawater. It is used commercially in everything from car batteries to bath salts and can be aerosolised by the burning of fossil fuels, increasing the acidity of the atmosphere. Microbes that breathe sulphate - that is, gain energy by reacting sulfate with organic (carbon-containing) compounds - are thought to be some of the oldest types of organisms on Earth.","Discovery made after drilling a small hole through the Ross Ice Shelf .

"High-risk Australian jihadist Musa Cerantonio is set to walk free once deported to Melbourne. Cerantonio will be deported from the Philippines on Tuesday night, and is due to arrive back in Australia on Thursday, according to the ABC. Although Philippine authorities are treating the religious extremist as a 'high-value prisoner', he will not be taken into custody because there are no warrants for his arrest in Australia. Musa Cerantonio was arrested by local police in the Philippines on Friday, but could walk free when he is deported back to Australia . 'He is a VIP - a high risk and high value prisoner,' a guard told the Sydney Morning Herald last week. Cerantonio, who converted to from Catholicism to Islam at 17, was expected to be deported for breaching the Philippines' immigration laws this week. Changing his name from Robert Edward, the 29-year-old was detained last Friday in the central Filipino city of Cebu where he was believed to have been hiding from Australian authorities, despite claiming on Twitter he had arrived in the Middle East just days before. He was found with a Filipina fashion designer claiming to be his wife, inside an apartment. Australian authorities cancelled his passport, triggering his arrest and leaving without any documentation. Police said Australian agencies had been monitoring Cerantonio's activities since February when he arrived in Cebu, the country's largest metropolis outside Manila and also his trip to the Filipino island of Mindanao. The Philippines has a large Muslim minority in the southern region of Mindanao, a hotbed for a decades-old Muslim insurgency and where Islamic militants linked to al-Qaeda also operate. As there is no warrant for his arrest, Cerantonio, pictured head down with Filipino police operatives on the day of his arrest, he could be a free man . Born to an Italian father and a mother of Irish heritage, Cerantonio has been living in the Philippines since 2013 and is one of the most influential supporters of Middle East jihadists. Since his arrest, he has been held in an immigration jail at Metro Manila's police camp at Taguig city. The jail holds some of the Philippines' top security prisoners, with Cerantonio being kept in a cell by himself. Australian Federal Police investigating terrorism and violations of the Foreign Incursions and Recruitment Act will continue to consider Cerantonio a person of interest. This means it is illegal for Cerantonio to promote others joining foreign paramilitary forces or insurgencies. On Wednesday, Attorney-General George Brandis introduced legislation to parliament which would strengthen ASIO's powers, enabling the national security intelligence service to track national security threats. Within hours of Cerantonio's arrest, a Facebook page calling for his release hit the social media site. Cerantonio himself has previously used the internet to urge people to join 'jihad'. Scroll down for video . A Facebook page calling for Australian jihadist Musa Cerantonio's release has emerged . It has more than 3,000 likes and contains messages of support for the Australian jihadist . Followers of the Melbourne-born jihadist, who is one of extremist group Islamic State's most prolific members urging people to join them in Iraq and Syria, have used the page to post messages of support for Cerantonio. Last week, the Abbott Government listed Islamic State as a terrorist organisation when it pushed through amendments to the criminal code. Created on the same day as the jihadist's arrest, the Release Brother Musa Cerantonio page has attracted more than 3,200 likes and calls for Filipino authorities to free 'the man who opened our mind and dig the very root of jihad in the Philippines and All of the Muslim Lands'. One supporter wrote: 'I love him so much, may Allah help and protect him always, he was chosen by Allah...stay strong bro'. 'May he be protected by ALLAH in all matters. He has the knowledge and courage given by ALLAH to tell the truth about ISLAM...,' another wrote on the page. Cerantonio was arrested on Friday in Lapu-Lapu City in the Philippines . In a telephone interview on Friday, July 11, Supt Capa told AAP that Cerantonio had 'been in Cebu since February... For the most part, he keeps to himself in his rooms, in hotels or apartments'. 'In one broadcast on his website, he called on brother Muslims to join the war in Iraq and Syria.' Supt Capa said Cerantonio was arrested and would be deported because the Australian government cancelled his passport, making him an illegal alien. However, Mr Banas said there is 'no evidence linking him to any terror act'. His arrest came more than a week after he tweeted on social media he had arrived in the Middle East to join his brothers of the Islamic State - which is also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. 'Al-Hamdulillah I have arrived in the land of Khilafah in Ash-Sham! May Allah honor all Muslims during this blessed time with His obedience,' he posted on Twitter. Two days before that he tweeted: 'Insha'Allah I will be arriving in Ash-Sham very shortly, keep us in your du'a, getting ready to travel.' Al-Hamdulillah means 'Thanks and Praise to God' in Arabic, Insha'Allah translates to 'God-willing', Ash-Sham refers to the Levant and the term du'a is used for the word 'prayers'. The Australian Federal Police confirmed the arrest but neither confirmed nor denied whether they are conducting their own investigation. 'The AFP is aware that Philippine authorities have taken action in relation to Musa Cerantonio, which may result in his return to Australia,' the AFP said in a statement. A federal government spokeswoman said she was aware Cerantonio had been detained but would not comment further. Prior to his arrest, Melbourne-born Cerantonio tweeted he was in the Middle East . He is one of Islamic State's most prolific extremists with more than 6,000 followers on Twitter . 'We cannot say with certainty that he had any contact with local Muslim groups,' Supt Capa said, adding the Australian had been living with a Filipina woman and moving periodically around Cebu until his arrest at a one-room apartment near the airport. The 32-year-old woman -  who bought food and other supplies for Cerantonio - was wanted by police over an unrelated fraud case and was also arrested on Friday, he added. A police intelligence officer involved in the operation said Cerantonio had been in Mindanao, though there was no indication he had tried to recruit Filipinos or been in contact with Islamic militants in the area. 'This person... has a website and he propagates extreme teachings and advocates jihad and calling on Muslim brothers to go to Syria and Iraq to fight together with the ISIS,' the official said, referring to the Islamic State militants who have seized large swathes of territory in eastern Syria and in neighbouring Iraq. Cerantonio is expected to be deported back to Australia as early as Saturday . 'Sometimes he mentions the Philippine government (on his website), but does not call for violence' against it, the officer added, adding that the Australian has 'no overt following' in the Philippines. Television footage aired by the ABS-CBN network showed a bearded Caucasian man in a white robe being ushered out of an apartment by officers wearing helmets and flak jackets. A report in The Australian newspaper in June described Cerantonio as a preacher and 'one of (the Islamic State's) most influential propagandists', and that Australian police were planning to move against him. The newspaper said Cerantonio called for the assassination of Western leaders in a Facebook post in December, and that a study had found one in four foreign fighters in Syria followed his Twitter account. Recently, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop commented that the government will do everything it can to ensure Australians don't become radicalised overseas and bring their extremist views back home. Ms Bishop refused to comment specifically about Cerantonio to avoid jeopardising the work of Philippine authorities, but she said reports of Australian citizens getting involved with radicals and fighting overseas were disturbing. 'We are determined to ensure that Australians do not leave this country to take up fighting in another country, become radicalised and then return to Australia with these new skills and extremist outlooks,' she told reporters in Brisbane. 'We are taking every step we can to ensure that Australians are kept safe.'","Melbourne-born Cerantonio was arrested in the Philippines last Friday .

"The Danny Welbeck fan club used to seem a little short of members. There was Sir Alex Ferguson, Roy Hodgson, a handful of Manchester United fans, me… and that was pretty much it. But now Louis van Gaal is prepared to let Welbeck leave Old Trafford, that little club has grown somewhat. It now includes Arsene Wenger, Mauricio Pochettino, Roberto Martinez, Alan Pardew, Gus Poyet, Steve Bruce and Cesare Prandelli, the Galatasaray manager. All of those well-respected bosses now want the 23-year-old forward at their clubs, and I have yet to meet a fan of any of these teams who thinks otherwise. The Welbeck fan club is swelling fast, and with good reason. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Danny Welbeck take part in a Q&A with Wayne Rooney . Wanted: Danny Welbeck is in demand with Premier League clubs with his future uncertain at Old Trafford . At a stretch: The United forward in action after coming on as a substitute at Sunderland last Sunday . Welbeck is a young English striker of huge potential. He is a supreme athlete – extremely fast thanks to his long strides, and strong enough to hold off the toughest defenders in world football. Anyone who saw him shirtless on Copacabana before the World Cup will know that his body is the ideal shape for a modern footballer, a physique as impressive even as Cristiano Ronaldo’s. He is also blessed with quick feet, technical agility and ability rarely seen in English strikers, and the ambition to attempt the audacious – witness his sublime chipped finish on the opening day of last season against Swansea. He is a fine link player, plays with his head up, is always looking to bring others into the game and for quick one-twos on the edge of the box. Bags packed? Welbeck wants regular starts and could be ready to quit United to find it . Young Lion: Welbeck played a big part in a bright England performance against Italy at the World Cup . Strikes: Positions from which Welbeck scored his goals in the Premier League last season . He was thrust into the limelight when Ferguson shunted Wayne Rooney aside for the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid in February last year, and then dropped his big name star for the second leg. United lost the tie after Nani’s red card but Welbeck scored in the Bernabeu and bullied the likes of Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane. A star was born or, at least, it should have been. Despite that sparkling introduction to the game’s biggest stage, Welbeck has not established himself at United and is on the verge of leaving the club. He is loved by some United fans for being a Manchester born-and-bred product of the youth system, a supporter of the club who never fails to give it all to the cause, even if that means a defensive-minded shift on the left wing. Other United fans simply see him as not progressing as a player and another symbol of the post-Ferguson mess Van Gaal finds himself in. To many other fans he is a laughing stock, a striker with a woeful goalscoring record who should never be near the England team. The next Emile Heskey, even (although this opinion seems to dissipate when Welbeck is linked with their club). Bully: Welbeck rises highest to head a goal for United against Real Madrid in February last year . Blast: Welbeck scored a stunning debut goal for United from long range against Stoke in 2008 . Reach for the sky: The young striker celebrates a strike against Wolves in the Carling Cup in 2009 . Withdrawn: Welbeck's average position on the pitch last season was behind the main striker . It can’t be denied that Welbeck’s goalscoring record is extremely disappointing for an international forward. In 117 appearances in the Premier League over his career to date, he has scored just 26 goals - a strike-rate of 0.2 goals per game with 262 minutes played per goal. He can look lost when he sees the whites of goalkeepers’ eyes – just ask Manuel Neuer after last season’s Champions League quarter-final first leg when Welbeck fluffed a glorious one-one-one chance. He has also been criticised – most notably by Thierry Henry on the BBC during the World Cup - for taking the easy options, playing safe passes instead of using his pace, power and vision to punch holes in the opposition. All are valid criticisms and Welbeck must improve these areas of the game. But how is a striker supposed to become more clinical in front of goal when he is shunted on the wing, seeing even fewer sights of goal, and asked to graft in a role almost more defensive than attacking, as David Moyes asked of him last season? When Moyes did play him further as a striker, Welbeck's goals per games ratio dramatically improved, and he scored six goals in six Premier League matches in a run between December 2013 and January 2014. The only way Welbeck will truly realise his potential is to start games, up front or as a No 10, on a regular basis. And he need look no further than Daniel Sturridge for proof. Sturridge, now 24, is becoming a superstar at Liverpool following four years in the doldrums at Chelsea. He too was shunted wide to play in a role that blunted his talents, or as a substitute, cast in the shadow of Didier Drogba and Fernando Torres just as Welbeck is with Rooney and Robin van Persie. Going nowhere: Daniel Sturridge was a lost talent at Chelsea until he moved to Liverpool . Hotshot: Sturridge is now one of the most feared strikers in the Premier League and England's No 9 . At Chelsea, Sturridge scored just 13 times in 63 Premier League appearances - a strike rate of 0.2 goals per game (just like Welbeck now) and averaging a goal every 220 minutes. Last season he netted 21 goals - behind only Suarez in the goalscorers’ charts - and is England’s undisputed No 9. Welbeck can similarly flourish if given the opportunity elsewhere and that is why his fan club now includes the likes of Wenger. Manchester City and their embarrassment of riches apart, Welbeck would improve the strikeforce of every single Premier League club. Buy him while you can.

"Harmful: Making young girls wear pink reinforces gender stereotypes, according to an educational expert . Making girls wear pink is wrong and could harm their future, an education expert has warned. Hannah Webster, a spokesman for a private schools' organisation, said the idea of having blue for a boy and pink for a girl is 'pernicious' because it leads them towards certain roles regardless of their real identities. She said: 'There will be those who say that pink and blue colour coding does not matter - that it is just a fact that boys like blue and girls like pink. They are wrong.' She added: 'If we designate a particular colour to a gender, it leads us to designate all manner of other things by gender too. 'The result is girls and boys read different kinds of books, play with different kinds of toys, study different subjects, consider different occupations, have different roles within the workplace and family and are ultimately valued differently by society. 'What is pernicious about this is that everyone is then attributed with roles and characteristics regardless of their individual identities and talents. And this then occurs before a child is even born.' Writing in the magazine Attain, produced by the Independent Association of Prep Schools, she writes that, at the time of the First World War, the colours were reversed. According to a 1918 edition of Ladies' Home Journal, the rule at the time was pink for the boy and blue for the girl. Blue was considered a softer colour which was prettier for girls, and also the colour in which the Virgin Mary was often depicted. Ms Webster, the association's communications manager, wrote: 'Most of us want a society in which people are judged according to their whole identities rather than just their gender. Modern phenomenon: Girls clothing is increasingly only available in pink shades - but a century ago, the colour was associated with boys . 'We can only have a hope of this if we stop presuming an array of character traits - starting on the basis of colour preference - go hand in hand with a person's biological sex.' Ms Webster spoke out after the parents' group Let Toys Be Toys launched a campaign to remove 'boys and girls' signs in shops. Marks & Spencer and Toys R Us are among those who have already pledged to make its toys 'gender neutral'. As previously reported in MailOnline, Let Toys Be Toys was set up by a group of British parents in November 2012, calling for a change in the way toys are marketed to boys and girls. They had noticed girls were increasingly being encouraged to play with dolls, prams and kitchens - all inevitably in pink colours - while toys deems to be for boys were cars, guns and sports-related. Colour-coding babies: This gives them roles and characteristics regardless of their individual identities and talents from birth . One of the campaign's founders, Tricia Lowther, 44, a self-employed copywriter from Durham, who has a six-year-old daughter, told the MailOnline: 'It does bother a lot of parents, we seem to have tapped in to a huge and growing sense of frustration with the way toys are promoted according to outdated, illogical and sexist stereotypes. 'I can't speak for any of the others but what pushed me to make a stand was the realisation, after my daughter was born, that gender stereotyping in children's products had become worse than when I was a child myself back in the Seventies. It's something that has become almost impossible to escape and is very limiting for children.' A similar Let Books Be Books project, calling for reading material not to be marked as 'for boys' or 'for girls' is backed by children's laureate Malorie Blackman, poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy and the author Philip Pullman.","Hannah Webster said pink for girls and blue for boys is 'pernicious'

DMS.Article.init('top'); . }); . Gone: Michael Jackson died from an overdose of propofol in 2009 . The jury in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial has ruled that the concert promoter was not negligent in hiring the doctor who treated the singer. Jackson's mother sued concert promoter AEG Live LLC over the hiring of Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for giving Jackson an overdose of the anesthetic propofol in 2009. Katherine Jackson claimed AEG Live should have done a thorough background check on Murray. The Jackson family matriarch was seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for herself and her son's three children. The company denied hiring Murray and said he had been picked by the singer as the doctor for his upcoming shows. The panel of six men and six women began deliberating on September 26, more than five months after the start of the trial that offered an unprecedented look into the superstar's private life. The case provided the closest look yet at Jackson's drug use and his battles against chronic pain and insomnia. It also took jurors behind the scenes in the rough and tumble world of negotiations with one of the world's most famous entertainers looking to solidify his legendary status after scandal interrupted his career. 'We reached a verdict that we understand that not everybody is going to agree with,' jury foreman Gregg Barden said after the decision was reached. Scroll down for video . Trouble: Dr Conrad Murray, who was already convicted of involuntary manslaughter for giving Jackson an overdose of the anesthetic, was the basis for the latest trial which was a lawsuit against the concert promoter . 'But the decision was reached after very careful consideration of five months of testimony, thousands of documents and of course the guidance of the court.' Witnesses said he saw the 'This Is It' concerts as a chance for personal redemption after being acquitted of child molestation. But as the opening date of the shows approached, associates testified that he had bouts of insecurity and agonized over his inability to sleep. They said he turned to the drug propofol and found Murray, who was willing to buy it in bulk and administer it to him on a nightly basis even though it is not meant to be used outside operating rooms. Saying their peace: Juror Gregg Barden spoke to the awaiting media after arriving at the not guilty verdict against AEG . All eyes on them: The group issued a joint statement saying that they knew not everyone would agree with them . Testimony at the civil trial showed that only Jackson and Murray knew he was taking the drug. In his closing argument, AEG Live attorney Marvin Putnam told jurors that the company would have pulled the plug on the shows if they knew he was using the anesthetic. 'AEG would have never agreed to finance this tour if they knew Mr. Jackson was playing Russian roulette in his bedroom every night,' Brian Panish, a lawyer for the Jackson family, countered that AEG Live was negligent by not looking far enough to find out what it needed to know about Murray. Major pull: At the time of his death Jackson was prepping for the 10-night 'This Is It' concert in London which was run by concert promoter AEG Live LLC, who the jury ruled was not negligent in hiring Murray . Those who live on: Michael's mother Katherine is now the trustee of his estate and cares for his children, including daughter Paris (seen together in January 2012) He claimed in his closing argument that the lure of riches turned the company and Murray into mercenaries who sacrificed the pop star's life in a quest to boost their own fortunes. Panish asked jurors: 'Do people do things they shouldn't do for money? People do it every day.' He said a $150,000-a-month contract to care for Jackson was a lifeline to help Murray climb out of his financial troubles, which included $500,000 in debt. AEG Live, meanwhile, had only one interest — launching a world tour for the King of Pop that would yield untold millions in profits, the lawyer said. AEG Live's lawyers framed the case as being about personal choice, saying Jackson made bad choices about the drug that killed him and the doctor who provided it. They said he was the architect of his own demise and no one else can be blamed. Putnam said Jackson insisted on hiring the cardiologist, despite objections from AEG Live. 'It was his money and he certainly wasn't going to take no for an answer,' the lawyer said. Putnam portrayed AEG Live and its executives as victims of deception by Jackson and Murray. He showed brief excerpts from the 'This Is It' documentary to show that Jackson appeared in top form just 12 hours before he died. Making the case: Brian Panish was hired by Jackson's family to argue that AEG should have done a background check on the doctor and found him to be unsuitable to treat the 'King of Pop' Legal minds: Panish, seen here talking with AEG's attorneys Kathryn Cahan and Marvin Putnam, ultimately won the case . Closing argument: Putnam told jurors that the company would have pulled the plug on the shows if they knew he was using the anesthetic . 'AEG Live did not have a crystal ball,' he said. 'Dr. Murray and Mr. Jackson fooled everyone. They want to blame AEG for something no one saw.' Murray was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter for causing Jackson's death and is due to be released in October after serving a two year jail sentence. Jurors heard testimony from more than 50 witnesses, including Jackson's mother and his eldest son, Prince, as well as days of testimony from AEG executives who were repeatedly asked about emails in which they discussed Jackson's missed rehearsals and described Murray's pay as a done deal. They also heard about Jackson's close relationship to many of his doctors, including Murray, who he first met in Las Vegas in 2007. Katherine Jackson called the case a search for the truth about the death of her son and the trial featured potentially embarrassing revelations for both sides. AEG's executives had their emails picked apart, revealing concerns that Jackson wouldn't be able to perform the shows as planned, that a lawyer at their parent company referred to Michael Jackson as 'the freak,' and that Jackson was derided even though the company had invested more than $30million in his shows. AEG Live, meanwhile, laid out Jackson's medical history, presenting testimony about his use of drugs, including the powerful painkiller Demerol, for pain stemming from an accident that occurred decades ago while he was filming a Pepsi commercial. Jackson had no trace of that drug in his system when he died. Legend lives on: Fans pay tribute to Jackson by imitating his signature moves outside the Los Angeles court . The lawyers called witnesses who recounted Jackson's use of propofol dating back to the 1990s. In 1997, two German doctors administered the anesthetic to help the singer sleep between shows in Munich. A few years later, Jackson requested the anesthetic from a dental anesthesiologist who refused, as did another doctor who testified that Jackson kept a box of propofol in his bedroom at Neverland Ranch. On the issue of possible damages, expert witnesses for the company said any estimate of Jackson's future earnings were speculative, and they showed the panel that the singer was deeply in debt and consistently spent more than he earned. In the verdict form, jurors were first asked to decide the central question of the case — whether AEG Live hired Murray to treat Jackson. During the trial, they heard evidence that AEG had drafted a contract that was signed by Murray. But there were no indications that it was signed by AEG Live or Jackson. Attorneys for the singer's mother argued that Jackson's signature was not necessary, but the company's attorneys said the contract required his consent to be binding. Jackson's mother and his three children are supported by his estate, which provides a comfortable lifestyle for them and erased hundreds of millions of dollars in debts by debuting new projects and releasing new music featuring the King of Pop.","Katherine Jackson, the singer's mother, has lost her lawsuit against concert promoter AEG  as she argued they were negligent .

"A fifth of us will try to cut down on alcohol in 2013 but sadly few will succeed . Just one in 11 people manage to keep their New Year's resolutions for at least six months, according to new research. Just under half break their resolutions within a fortnight, blaming a lack of will power. And of those planning to make a New Year's resolution, almost a fifth plan to cut back on alcohol. The poll of 4,000 adults by Cancer Research UK found 55 per cent have made New Year's resolutions in the past, and 23 per cent have made a resolution for 2013. When asked how long previous New Year's resolutions had lasted, nine per cent said they stuck to them for at least six months. However, 39 per cent had given up within two weeks. Of those that plan to or are thinking about giving something up for 2013, 19 per cent said they would cut down on alcohol. Other popular New Year's resolutions were to spend less money (34 per cent), cut down on chocolate (21 per cent), and go to the gym (22 per cent). Cancer Research UK is looking for volunteers to sign up for its new fundraising campaign, Dryathlon(TM), which is encouraging people nationwide to test their willpower and take the challenge of staying off alcohol for January, raising money for a good cause at the same time. Ed Aspel, Head of Dryathlon at Cancer . Research UK, said: 'We wanted to find out how good the great British . public are at sticking to those fabled New Year's Resolutions, which it . turns out we find harder to stick to than we might think. 'We'd encourage the fifth of us . who already plan to cut down on alcohol to go one step further and give .

MAKE IT EASY - don't start by . planning to train for an hour every day or eat nothing but meat and veg . if that's a huge change in your habits. It won't happen.

According to research from Utrecht University in the . Netherlands, you should focus on positives rather than negatives, such . as resolving to eat more veg and protein. 4. USE IF/THEN PATTERNS - . programme your brain as you would a computer and you won't need to . wrestle with temptation all the time, says Professor Mark Conner of the . University of Leeds. 'Set up cues that prompt your planned behaviour,' he suggests. For instance, 'if I feel hungry before lunch then I will . eat an apple, not a chocolate bar'.

"Google should be broken up to curb its dominance of the internet, say MEPs. The European Parliament is poised to call for the firm to be split into separate components in the most audacious attempt yet to loosen its grip on the sector. A draft motion backed by several MEPs and leaked to the Financial Times said investigators should look at ‘unbundling search engines from other commercial services’. This would mean separating Google’s search functions from other features such as its YouTube video-sharing website, or its internet maps service. The US firm is already being investigated by the European Commission in a long-running competition probe . One industry source said: ‘These guys are calling for the break-up of Google.’ The US firm is already being investigated by the European Commission in a long-running competition probe. While the European Parliament has no powers to ban or block Google, the Commission is its executive arm and can levy fines or bring in new rules to curb the company’s power. Google has grown to dominate the internet and international telecoms markets since it was set up in a garage in 1998. Its search engine accounts for two-thirds of all online searches, leaving rivals Bing and Yahoo trailing. It also provides software for 80 per cent of the mobile phones sold across the world with its Android operating system, while its Chrome internet browser is used by roughly 30 per cent of home computers. It has also photographed every road in the UK and many other parts of the world in order to build up its ‘street view’ function, which allows users to see images of almost every home in Britain. During this project, the company inadvertently harvested data from millions of UK homes, which it was later ordered to delete or face criminal charges. Google has also begun deleting search results for embarrassing articles under the European Court of Justice’s new controversial ‘right to be forgotten’ Google has also begun deleting search results for embarrassing articles under the European Court of Justice’s new controversial ‘right to be forgotten’. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office has criticised the company in the past for having ‘baffling’ privacy rules that leave consumers in the dark about how their data will be used. The company, which has an unofficial motto of ‘do no evil’, has also been criticised for its ‘immoral’ tax policies that see it funnel large amount of money into offshore havens. Five years ago the EC launched a competition investigation into Google over fears it was stifling rivals by promoting its own websites and services. The company has repeatedly – but unsuccessfully – tried to settle the case, proposing to pay a fine if none of the findings of the investigation would be made public. The EC’s digital chief, Günther Oettinger, has taken a hard line on the company since taking office in September. Speaking shortly after his appointment, he said: ‘When it comes to Google, in the light of complaints that have been received, you have to decide: are you going to get into a compromise with Google?’ The motion, set to be presented in the European Parliament in the next few days ahead of a vote on Thursday, will increase pressure on the Commission to tighten its grip on Google. German MEP Andreas Schwab, who is one of the motion’s backers, said splitting up the company ‘cannot be excluded’ as an option. Spanish MEP Ramon Tremosa said Google was unlikely to release its algorithm – which it uses to rank search results – to competitors, which leaves splitting it up as the only other viable option. Google has refused to comment, but executives at the company are reported to be outraged at the suggestion and have slammed it as ‘politically motivated’.","European Parliament is poised to call for firm to be split up .

"An Atlanta woman who lost her husband in a horrific car accident in 2011 embraced the driver who was responsible for it on Thursday. Tamara Matthews pleaded guilty in court today to causing the accident that killed Sandra Walker's husband Glen Walker - and Matthews' own son, Joshua Jenkins, 16. After Matthews was sentenced to 36 months probation and 500 hours of community service, Walker's widow, who suffered a life-altering brain injury in the crash, hugged her. Scroll down for video . Forgiveness: Sandra Walker (left) hugs Tamara Matthews (right) after she pleads guilty to a misdemeanor charge of homicide in the accident that killed Walker's husband Glen . 'I know she is going through as much pain as I am feeling. I wanted her to know that I forgive her for what she did,' Sandra Walker, 32, told WSB-TV. Police said the crash happened when Matthews drove her black minivan across the center line into the Walker family's white minivan on November 5, 2011 on Flat Shoals Road in Fulton County. The car, driven by Glen Walker with his wife and their two children as passengers, flipped over. Walker died from his injuries weeks after the crash. Sandra Walker, a kindergarten teacher in Gwinnett County, suffered a traumatic brain injury. 'Glen took the brunt of the impact and paid with his life,' said walker's sister Michelle Walker told CBS-46 in 2011. Matthews' son, Joshua Jenkins, died at the scene. Soul mates: Glen and Sandra Walker were married and had two young children at the time of the accident . Heart-rending: Sandra Walker reads her victim impact statement to the court . During her victim impact statement, Walker cried and told Matthews she forgives her for the crash that took the life of her husband. 'Ms Matthews and I have a lot more in common than is showing on the surface. But the one thing that is obvious is that we both suffered great loss,' Walker told the court. She spoke about her husband and their deep love and devotion, and how his loss affected not just her, but many, many others. 'He wasn't just my husband; this isn't just about me. Others are mourning his loss as well: his mother and father are still waiting for him to return and walk through their door. His brother and cousin have lost their person, their mentor and friend who was always there to give them guidance and advice. Friends, family and coworkers whose lives have forever been changed. Deadly accident: The Walkers' car was flipped over and Sandra Walker received a traumatic brain injury, while her husband Glen died in hospital . Forgiveness: Sandra Walker and Tamara Matthews both sobbed as they hugged in court . Young family: The Walkers' two children were unharmed in the accident that took their father's life . 'At 35 years old, over 600 people attended his funeral. He was a difference-maker in people's lives,' she said. She said her traumatic brain injury completely changed her life. She had to re-learn how to walk, shower, drive and take care of herself and her two young children. 'And live both without my life partner and with a disability that has left me unable to return to work or live independently,' she said. She said her brain injury took away not only her memories of the accident but her memory of the last interactions she had with her husband. Nevertheless, Walker said she never wanted jail time for the woman responsible for her husband's death, who also lost her own beloved son. 'I have no anger or angst towards you.'","Sandra Walker, 32, told Tamara Matthews she forgives her .

"A police investigation has been launched after a series of disturbing photos emerged showing schoolchildren licking whipped cream from the knee of a Polish priest. The images - which are apparently part of an 'initiation ceremony' at Salesians High School in Lubin, southern Poland - show both male and female 13-year old pupils taking part in the bizarre practice. Father Marcin Kozyra, who is also the . school's principal, has defended his actions by saying such ceremonies . for first year pupils have been an annual event for many years.

'This is very disturbing,' said Marek Michalak, the Polish government's spokesman on child affairs . Defence: The preist said no-one had ever complained, and said he saw nothing wrong in his actions . 'Surely the boundaries of decency and . acceptable forms of bodily contact have been exceeded.

"Australians were warned today that the British are about to become unbearable - thanks to a series of recent and upcoming events that will have everyone beating their proud chests for weeks to come. An Australian newspaper has given notice to its readers that the imminent birth of a royal baby, Andy Murray's win at Wimbledon, The Lions victory over the Wallabies, the Tour de France and, by the looks of things The Ashes, Britain has much to shout about - and will keep on shouting. 'Pity the poor 100,000 Australians living there, but hazards abound here at home - rugby tourists still lurk in Australian hotels, lolling about in self-satisfaction after their test victory,' says Sydney's news.com. Australians were warned today that the British are about to become unbearable - thanks to a series of events to make us unbearably proud - including Andy Murray's Wimbledon win . An Australian newspaper has given notice to its readers that the imminent birth of a royal baby will also contribute to a swelling of British pride . And of course, Sydney's Daily Telegraph also listed The Lions victory over the Wallabies as one of the things the nation would be 'shouting about' Why England is magnificent: . 1) London, one of the greatest cities in the world! 2) The Royal family! 3) Proper pubs and proper beer! 4) Shakespeare! 5) The food! Toad in the hole, crumpets and Sunday roast!Whereas with poor old Australia... 1) Animals that kill you are everywhere. 2) Everywhere is too far away from everywhere else. 3) Nothing good on television. Ever. 4) Incomprehensible sports. 5) Very bad losers when we beat them at sports with proper, rather than 'Aussie', rules. But in an attempt to boost the spirits of everyone Down Under in the face of an unstoppable swelling of British pride, the paper has listed 10 points that it says are worth reminding Britons about. For a start, there is the weather, with cricket officials at Trent Bridge, where the first of the Ashes is being played, looking at the skies and wondering just when rain will stop play. Then there is the English beer, bitter and lager, the bitter being bitter and warm, the lager tasting like gnat's p**s. As for British beaches, well, says they website, they are 'mostly armoured with pebbles or cobble stones as opposed to sand, necessitating deck chairs and barring long walks or lazing about on a towel. And the water is freezing.' British food is also under attack, with . chicken tikka masala taking over from fish and chips, with one English . food critic describing the meal as 'the culinary equivalent of . Liebfraumilch.' Holidays? When they go overseas, Britons . tend to cluster in enclaves, says the paper, where they eat British food . and avoid interaction with foreigners, apart from the waiters. England's James Anderson celebrates after bowling Australia's Michael Clarke during the first Ashes cricket test match between England and Australia. The paper has listed 10 points that it says are worth reminding Britons about to stave off boasting . Next there's the huge cost of paying for transport to get from Heathrow airport to Gatwick to fly on to, say, Ibiza, followed by at least three hours to get through customs, security and then allowing for flight delays. There's also the question of British . happiness - while Australia is in the top five in a recent survey, . Britain came in as the 10th happiest nation among developed economies. And of course, Britain is a nation . divided. The paper says that the north and south of England hate each . other, the Scots hate the English, the Welsh hate the English, the . English hate everyone and everyone hates the Welsh. The paper also critcises the English beer, . bitter and lager, claiming the bitter is bitter and warm, the lager . tasting like gnat's p**s. But Australian beers are also often crticised . for being tasteless and weak . It claims when Britons go overseas, they tend to cluster in enclaves, eat British food and avoid interaction with foreigners. The same could be said for the high number of Australians who congregate in Australian themed bars . On the economic and job front, says the paper, the UK's economy is 'basically down the toilet. Don't let a Pom fool you with stories about the greatness of the English pound.' Unemployment in Australia is at 5.7 per cent, while in Britain it's 7.9 per cent. Finally, there's those sporting wins. The paper says it should be pointed out to all British rugby bores that the Lions side is a composite team of British and Irish players. 'And if the Poms win the cricket, remind them who Keven Pietersen, Jon Trott and Matt Prior are. 'They're South Africans.'","News.com.au also criticises English beaches, beers and food .

"The parents of two teenage girls struck by a car, which killed one of them and seriously injured the other, have expressed sympathy for the teacher who was driving. Kalie Gill, 15, and her sister Lindsey, 12, were at a church festival in Yonkers, New York, on Friday night when Roseanne Piccirilli lost control of her Jeep. As they maintain a vigil by the hospital bed of Lindsey, who has not yet been told her big sister is dead, the Gill family have said they have no animosity to Mrs Piccirilli. Scroll down for video . Family tragedy: Sisters Lindsey and Kalie Gill were hit by a car at a carnival, which killed Kalie . 'She’s a good woman, a good person and she didn’t mean to do this,' Karen Gill told LoHud News. 'I believe it was a freak accident. I just wish her well.' Her husband Damien added: 'It’s something she’ll have to live with too.' It was just after 9pm on Friday that the sixth grade teacher lost control of her Jeep, causing it to plow into the carnival crowd, killing Kalie and injuring her sister and two others. Lindsey suffered serious injuries including a broken femur, and has undergone several operations since the crash. 'She’s a tough one. She’s a fighter,' Mr Gill said, adding: 'She has been under sedation . and has been in pain.' Mrs Piccirilli reached out to the family in a statement, and thanked them for their compassion. Tributes: Candles and messages are left for 15-year-old Kalie who died on Friday . Crash: A Jeep driven by a schoolteacher plowed into the sisters during a church festival . 'I am grateful for the kindness they . have shown in their public statements, and cannot even imagine the sense . of loss that they feel,' the 55-year-old's statement said. 'My . family and I are praying for the recovery of Lindsey and ask that God . will watch over her and over the soul of her sister Kalie. This is a wonderful family, and what has happened is so very tragic.' Injured: Lindsey, 12, is still in hospital where she is being treated for broken bones . Father James Healy said moments after the fatal incident Mrs Piccirilli told him she had been unable to stop, News 12 Westchester reported. 'She . said the car wouldn't obey when she was putting her foot on the brake. She said it felt like she was putting her foot on the accelerator,' he . said. The St Paul Apostle teacher had been on the way to the carnival, where she had volunteered to help out. Police have taken the 2002 Jeep away for analysis and took a routine blood sample from the teacher, who had no previous traffic violations on her driving record. Relatives of the Gills have been flying in from their native Ireland to help the family through their grief. The family had only just returned to the Bronx area of New York over the summer after spending several years in Co Leitrim, Ireland. Both Kalie and Lindsey had been born in the U.S. when the family first relocated with older sister Jamie, now 21, in the 1990s. 'Kalie was wonderful, the best. Just perfect,' Mrs Gill, a stay-at-home mother, told the Irish Voice. The 15-year-old sophomore and her younger sister were incredibly close and always together. Lindsey has not yet been told that Kalie died in the crash. 'There’s enough going on with her right now that she doesn’t need to know,' Mr Gill, a carpenter, said. Tributes and a touching YouTube film dedicated to the memory of the popular St Barnabas schoolgirl have been set up. Yonkers' Irish-American community has also rallied to support the grieving family. 'People have been so kind,' Mr Gill said. 'We could feed the whole hospital with all of the donations of food we’ve gotten.' Grief: 15-year-old Kalie, who had just returned to New York from Ireland, died on Friday . 'Just perfect': Kalie's parents paid tribute to their teenage daughter . Lieutenant Patrick McCormack said it could be months before crash investigators know what happened. He has not said how far Mrs Piccirilli's car traveled and said witnesses were still being interviewed. Skid marks were visible on the sidewalk, next to a flowers, pictures and messages of sympathy for Kalie and her sister.","55-year-old woman plowed into American-Irish sisters in her Jeep .

"Imagine a world where mosquito-sized robots fly around stealing samples of your DNA. Or where a department store knows from your buying habits that you're pregnant even before your family does. That is the terrifying dystopian world portrayed by a group of Harvard professors at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, where the assembled elite heard that the notion of individual privacy is effectively dead. Imagine a world where mosquito-sized robots fly around stealing samples of your DNA - hat is the terrifying dystopian world portrayed at Davos ©Christophe Simon (AFP/File) 'Welcome to today. We're already in that world,' said Margo Seltzer, a professor in computer science at Harvard University. 'Privacy as we knew it in the past is no longer feasible... How we conventionally think of privacy is dead,' she added. Experts predict technology will lead to: . Mosquito-sized robots fly around stealing samples of your DNA . Department stores knowing from your buying habits that you're pregnant even before your family does . Governments are talking about putting in back doors for communication . Another Harvard researcher into genetics said it was 'inevitable' that one's personal genetic information would enter more and more into the public sphere. Sophia Roosth said intelligence agents were already asked to collect genetic information on foreign leaders to determine things like susceptibility to disease and life expectancy. 'We are at the dawn of the age of genetic McCarthyism,' she said, referring to witch-hunts against Communists in 1950s America. What's more, Seltzer imagined a world in which tiny robot drones flew around, the size of mosquitoes, extracting a sample of your DNA for analysis by, say, the government or an insurance firm. Invasions of privacy are 'going to become more pervasive,' she predicted. 'It's not whether this is going to happen, it's already happening... We live in a surveillance state today.' Political scientist Joseph Nye tackled the controversial subject of encrypted communications and the idea of regulating to ensure governments can always see even encrypted messages in the interests of national security. 'Governments are talking about putting in back doors for communication so that terrorists can't communicate without being spied on. 'The problem is that if governments can do that, so can the bad guys,' Nye told the forum. 'Are you more worried about big brother or your nasty little cousin?' However, despite the pessimistic Orwellian vision, the academics were at pains to stress that the positive aspects of technology still far outweigh the restrictions on privacy they entail. Experts warn that stores will soon know from your buying habits that you're pregnant even before your family does. In the same way we can send tiny drones to spy on people, we can send the same machine into an Ebola ward to 'zap the germs,' Seltzer said. 'The technology is there, it is up to us how to use it,' she added. 'By and large, tech has done more good than harm,' she said, pointing to 'tremendous' advances in healthcare in some rural areas of the developing world that have been made possible by technology. And at a separate session on artificial intelligence, panellists appeared to accept the limit on privacy as part of modern life. Rodney Brooks, chairman of Rethink Robotics, an American tech firm, took the example of Google Maps guessing -- usually correctly -- where you want to go. 'At first, I found that spooky and kind of scary. 'Then I realised, actually, it's kind of useful,' he told the forum. Anthony Goldbloom, a young tech entrepreneur, told the same panel that what he termed the 'Google generation' placed far less weight on their privacy than previous generations. 'I trade my privacy for the convenience. Privacy is not something that worries me,' he said. 'Anyway, people often behave better when they have the sense that their actions are being watched.' The World Economic Forum in the swanky Swiss ski resort of Davos brings together some 2,500 of the global business and political elite for a meeting that ends Saturday.","Researchers told Davos that privacy is already non existent .

"Towards the end of his press conference at Arena Corinthians on Tuesday, Louis van Gaal was asked by a presenter from children’s television whether he thought youngsters in Holland should be allowed to stay up for the game against Argentina. Van Gaal can be an obtuse man but on this he was unequivocal. ‘I would always allow my children to watch the match because this is absolutely unique,’ said the  Holland coach. Look at the impact of the World Cup at a global level — and this is a semi-final. Eye to eye: Louis van Gaal and Robin van Persie talk in training . Rallying cry: Van Gaal has called on the Dutch public to ramp up their support . VIDEO Van Gaal hopeful on Van Persie fitness . ‘Most children are on holiday and they won’t sleep anyway because they will be so stressed and tense. I would strongly advise parents to let them watch the match.’ In Holland, they are just glad to have these decisions to make. This was supposed to be a World Cup of limited horizons for Van Gaal and his functional (his own word) team. Yet, here we are and the Dutch are still in town, preparing for a classic fixture to conjure memories of the 1978 final — won by Argentina in their own country — and a 1998 quarter-final — won by Holland in Marseille. Those games, of course, featured defining contributions by genuine superstars. Mario Kempes scored the opening goal in Buenos Aires and Dennis Bergkamp settled the meeting in France with perhaps the best goal of his stellar career in the final minute. On Wednesday night in mild, damp Sao Paulo, we have the opportunity to witness greatness once again. Non-flying Dutchman: Dennis Bergkamp scores against Argentina in 1998 . Decisive blow: Bergkamp scored the second as Holland ran out 2-1 winners in Marseille . The deposed World Footballer of the Year, Lionel Messi, has approached this tournament in Brazil as if intent on proving people were wrong to give this year’s title to Cristiano Ronaldo. So far, he has done a pretty reasonable job and without him Argentina would certainly no longer be here. Even Messi, though, would struggle to shift Holland’s Arjen Robben as player of the tournament in most people’s minds. The Bayern Munich forward has taken his game to new levels in South America and it is perhaps not surprising that Argentina appear to be approaching this game with some rather rudimentary ideas about how to stop him. Warning: Arjen Robben has been told to expect a rough ride against Argentina . Juggling skills: Robben looked relaxed in training on Tuesday ahead of the big game . ‘We have to be aggressive, to show the passion of the Argentine players to the Dutch — and especially to Robben,’ said Manchester City defender Martin Demichelis. ‘He doesn’t like physical contact, so you have to make him feel it and get under his skin. He is a  phenomenon but he’s not got much edge, he’s not a fighter. Therefore you have to attack him.’ Demichelis and Robben played together at Bayern in 2009-10. Maybe the South American hasn’t been watching his old club mate closely out here, though, as the Robben of summer 2014 has shown as much courage as any forward in this tournament. Last Saturday, four of Costa Rica’s back five were booked for crude, hacking fouls on Robben. Still, he strode forward. No nonsense: Martin Demichelis says Holland are in for some tough treatment . If Argentina are to stop him on Wednesday night in Sao Paulo, they will need to find a cuter way. ‘It’s ridiculous how much he is fouled,’ said Dutch midfielder Nigel de Jong. ‘They foul him because they can’t find another way. He is too good for most.’ It may seem rich to hear members of Holland’s derided 2010 World Cup final team moan about treatment afforded one of their own, given the way De Jong and others kicked the Spain midfield all over Johannesburg four years ago. Certainly, they will seek other ways to neutralise Messi. Van Gaal’s Holland are different in their approach from the team shaped by Bert van Marwijk and on Tuesday the current manager did his best to play down questions about Barcelona’s magician. ‘We are playing against Argentina and we always refer to teams and not individual players,’ said Van Gaal. Star man: Holland will have to stop Argentine ace Lionel Messi . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi highlights . ‘We have a plan ready for Argentina. We showed the players Argentina this morning. Messi was once elected best footballer in the world. There’s a  reason for that. If you score so many goals, you have an added value. ‘At the most important stage he can always pull it off but in principle he’s always found it difficult to show that at an international level. He wants to do that at this tournament and we want to stop him doing that, so that’s going to be quite a challenge.’ Dutch training contained some surprises on Tuesday as De Jong, struggling with a groin injury, joined in the session and captain Robin van Persie, who had a stomach bug, did not. Concern: Van Persie sat out the full session due to a stomach problem . VIDEO Team Profile: Netherlands highlights . We can expect the latter to start, however, and he is already looking ahead beyond the match. ‘Playing against Argentina is not a dream,’ said Van Persie. ‘It doesn’t interest me at all. We just have to win. A dream is to grab hold of that cup. ‘The other semi-final is Brazil- Germany so we’ll see who we’ll play next weekend.’ Dutch confidence is clearly high. Parents in Amsterdam and beyond should perhaps start planning ahead.","Manchester United star more interested in who Dutch could meet in the final .

"A timewaster dialled 999 to complain that McDonalds staff were refusing to serve them while another woman called police after she forgot the password to her laptop, it emerged today. West Midlands Police revealed some of their most bizarre calls which also included one man telephoning to ask whether he needed to put his area code before dialling 101 - the force’s non-emergency number. Others who misused the service included one caller asking if officers could come out to scare his sister, while another woman grumbled about being refused entry to a nightclub. Scroll down for audio . Which emergency service do you require?: Police today highlighted timewasting calls to 999 (stock image) The force released the almost unbelievable call-outs as part of an awareness campaign to highlight abuse of the emergency helpline, which receives around 700,000 calls a year. Chief Inspector Sally Holmes said: 'These calls are ridiculous and it doesn’t end just there. 'We regularly receive calls to 999 about lost property, people asking for directions and from people who have been denied entry to a nightclub. 'It's astonishing listening to them, but they hide a serious truth. 'Each call often takes minutes to deal with as staff have to clarify the situation and it might not sound like much but, if someone is trying to get through to report a genuine life or death emergency, then a minute is a very long time to wait. 'I cannot stress enough that the 999 number is for emergencies only, for guidance this is defined as: a crime is in progress, someone suspected of a crime is nearby, when there is danger to life or when violence is being used or threatened. 'To contact police for any other reason, call 101.' In one of the calls released by the force a hungry McDonalds customer called 999 to say he was holding up a queue at the drive-thru because staff had refused to serve him. Control room computer: Police say each call delays genuine callers receiving need urgent help (stock image) In the sound clip he can be heard saying: 'It is a bit of an emergency, but it isn’t at the same time. 'Basically I’ve come into McDonalds and ordered some food and there’s been a misunderstanding. 'We’ve drove back round and none of the staff are coming to the tills - they are just ignoring us. 'So we have decided to stop in the drive-thru now - but there’s 20 cars behind us now.' The frustrated operator can then be heard saying: 'This is not a police matter sir, at all.  You don't dial 999 unless it's a life or death emergency.' In a separate call, a woman tells a 999 call operator: 'I’m calling because my laptop had closed and I need the password number.' To which the baffled worker can then be heard replying: 'You have called the police to get a password for your laptop?' And in a final call released by the force, a voice with a strong Birmingham accent can be heard requesting: 'Excuse me sweetheart, what I’m after right....you know the 101 number - do you have to press 0121?' The force revealed that almost half of the 700,000 telephone calls received annually by the force’s emergency number were inappropriate. Today they began a 24-hour tweetathon to show the array of calls it receives. One tweet posted yesterday morning said: '999 call just received from an unlocked phone in a pocket, tying up an emergency line. Remember to check your phone is locked!'

"Shakespeare's plays contain their fair share of quarrelling princes – and now the Bard has sparked a real-life difference of opinion at the Palace. Scholars have revealed that the Duke of Edinburgh believes the playwright did not write everything attributed to him – in opposition to Prince Charles. Expert Stanley Wells, who has written in defence of Shakespeare’s authorship, last night said he had ‘crossed swords’ with Prince Philip on the issue. Crossing swords: Prince Philip believes not all plays attributed to Shakespeare were his, a scholar claims . He recalled asking the Prince if he was a heretic, only to be told ‘all the more so after reading your book’. According to Wells, Prince Philip believes it’s more likely that some plays were written by diplomat Sir Henry Neville, who was imprisoned in the Tower of London over a 1601 rebellion. Other theories have suggested that Francis Bacon or Christopher Marlowe may also have been the true authors. Another expert, Professor Jonathan Bate, revealed that Prince Charles, president of the Royal Shakespeare Company, had asked him to list arguments backing the Bard as author. He said: ‘I have got a hunch he wanted some arguments to put in front of his dad. I know he has the orthodox position on this.’ Much ado: There has long been a row among scholars about whether Shakespeare wrote all his works .","Scholars: Philip thinks not all plays attributed to Shakespeare were his .

"Mario Balotelli's 'miserable' performance summed up 'lightweight' Liverpool during their 1-0 defeat by Basle in the Champions League, according to Graeme Souness. The Anfield legend believes Balotelli, who failed to touch the ball in the penalty area as Liverpool lost, epitomised Brendan Rodgers' side's disappointing night in Switzerland. Speaking on Sky Sports on Wednesday night, Souness said: 'I think he summed up what Liverpool were about tonight. How many times did you see him and he ended up limping after any sort of challenge on him? VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Rodgers: Mario Balotelli is working hard to get scoring .

Souness, who won three European Cups with Liverpool, believes the current vintage now face an uphill battle to qualify from Group B with Real Madrid at home and away next up in the Champions League.

Balotelli looks down following a disappointing night for Liverpool in their second game of the group stages . Balotelli failed to register a single touch in the opposition's box as Liverpool failed to score in Switzerland . 'Tonight they were lightweight,' insisted Souness. 'You can talk all you want about tactics and formations, but if every one of the midfielders isn't winning challenges and the other team keeps taking the ball off you then you're always going to be on the back foot.

"It remains one of the great mysteries of the art world - what is the secret behind the mysterious smile boasted by the woman in the Mona Lisa, the world's most famous painting? Now a group of Italian art historians and archaeologists believe they are about to unravel the enigma after discovering what may be the skeleton of the woman who posed for artist Leonardo da Vinci. Lisa Gherardini, the second wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo, is recorded as buried in Saint Ursula convent and, after several false alarms, the team believe they have her remains. Ancient find: Archeologists have found a skeleton they believe belonged to the model who inspired Da Vinci's Mona Lisa . An archaeologist digs away at the floor of the medieval Convent of Saint Ursula in Florence, where the skeleton was discovered . The convent was the burial site of  Lisa Gherardini, wife of the wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo, who modelled for Leonardo Da Vinci . Silvano Vinceti, a former TV producer, is leading the team attempting to exhume and identify Gherardini's remains by sending the bones to universities in Italy and abroad, where they will be checked against the DNA of two confirmed relatives of Gherardini. If it is confirmed the researchers will be able to reconstruct her face. Speaking to CNN, he said: 'Once we identify the remains we can reconstruct the face, with a margin of error of two to eight per cent. By doing this, we will finally be able to answer the question the art historians can't: Who was the model for Leonardo?' There has been centuries of debate over the 77 by 52cm (30 by 31 inches) picture, also know as 'La Gioconda'. Most . modern historians agree that the lady depicted in the Mona Lisa was . Lisa del Giocondo, who became a nun after her husband's death. She died . in the convent on July 15, 1542, aged 63. However, Vinceti is not certain whether the painting that now hangs in the Louvre in Paris is of her. He added: 'When Leonardo began painting the model in front of him, he did not draw that metaphysical, ironic, poignant, elusive smile, but rather he painted a person who was dark and depressed.' He believes the famous smile was added later and may belong to da Vinci's longtime assistant Gian Giacomo Caprotti, also rumoured to have been his lover. The team unearthed a skull and other bones last year that they believe belonged to Lisa Gherardini . The skull was found five feet under the convent's original floor along with other fragments of human ribs and vertebrae . Other art historians say the 'Mona Lisa' is actually a sneaky self-portrait. An archeological team began digging at the abandoned Convent of Saint Ursula last year. They first had to dig through thick concrete, laid down ahead of plans to turn the convent into an army barracks. Muse: The enigmatic Mona Lisa has intrigued millions . But they quickly struck gold, finding . a crypt they believe to have been Lisa's final resting place and soon . after they unearthed a female-sized human skull. The skull was found five feet under the convent's original floor along with other fragments of human ribs and vertebrae. Plans . to continue the dig were suspended when the team ran out of funds, but . they were able to resume earlier this year and found the skeleton. Archeologist Silvano Vinceti, who is in charge of the dig, explained: 'We don't know yet if the bones belong to one single skeleton or more than one. 'But this confirms our hypothesis that in St.Ursula convent there are still human bones and we cannot exclude that among them there are bones belonging to Lisa Gherardini.' Several skeletons have been discovered but the group believe the latest find is the one they have been looking for. The initial discovery - made using . ground penetrating radar and ancient maps and documents - came after a . foot of modern concrete was removed and unearthed a layer of ancient, . 90-centimetre wide bricks. Professor . Vinceti said of the first discovery: 'This is a very exciting . development and the find is consistent with our records and our . preliminary research. 'The . crypt we have found is the one that was mentioned in church records from . 1495 and was reached via a grate and then a staircase. 'We also know from those records that in 1625 there was a second crypt and these are the ones we have found.' Resting place: The courtyard of the Saint Ursula convent in Florence, where archaeologists have been digging . Present on the dig is Natalia Gucciardini Strozzi, who is related to Lisa Gherardini and who is also a close friend of Prince Charles and former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Speaking after the skull was discovered, she said: 'It was so emotional being here - I didn't think I would get so emotional. I am certain that this is the final resting place of Lisa Gherardini.' It is not the first time that Professor Vinceti has used such techniques in his work. Last year similar methods were used to locate and identify the remains of Caravaggio, another Renaissance master. In a Dan Brown-style mystery, Professor Vincenti also claimed that a hidden message could be seen in the eyes of the Mona Lisa after examining them with a high powered magnifying glass. The Mona Lisa is an oil on panel painting owned by the French government and the image is so widely recognised and caricatured that it is considered the most famous painting in the world. Da Vinci started to paint it in 1503 or 1504 and finished it in 1519, shortly before his death, and after he had moved to France.","History experts may have found bones of Da Vinci's model Lisa Gherardini at a former convent .

"Tributes have been paid to a rough sleeper who died when a tree fell on a tent she was in during the storms and floods that struck parts of England and Wales. Michelle Conroy, 21, died and two other people - men aged 27 and 35 - were injured when the large spruce came down on Saturday night in Western Way, Exeter. Emergency services managed to free Ms Conroy but she died later from her injuries in hospital. Tragic: Michelle Conroy, 21, who died when she was hit by a falling tree in Exeter . Devon and Cornwall Police said she was in a sleeping bag in a tent underneath the tree when it came down in what they described as a 'tragic incident'. Tributes were left on Facebook to Ms Conroy, including from her partner David Browning. He wrote: 'RIP babygal I will never ever forget you. 'You will always be the first gal I ever loved and you will always be in my heart but it should never have happened to you. 'You were too young we still had a whole life to live together. And thanks to all my friends for the support and I'm sorry to all Michelle's family and friends. 'It was a tragic accident xxxx.'

'Unlike many of our visitors, Michelle wasn't dependant on drugs or alcohol, neither did she have any significant mental health issues, but rather she was a young person who was a lonely soul with a sad, broken childhood who simply couldn't sustain an independent life,' she told the Express and Echo. 'The street community were her family, friends and support network. 'We are all terribly sad to have lost her from our ‘Friday family'.'

"I had Novak Djokovic as strong favourite for the Australian Open title but now I am not so sure. I am feeling increasingly good vibes about Andy Murray. Novak’s semi-final win was one of the strangest five-set matches I have seen in a long time. He seemed to be struggling with himself, with his breathing, and in technical terms with his backhand. That is the world No 1’s bread-and-butter shot, and it misfired so much he was lucky Stan Wawrinka did not take full advantage. Andy Murray will make Novak Djokovic play to his maximum in their clash on Sunday . Djokovic was in wayward form against Wawrinka and missed a few bread and butter backhands . With the way Murray has been playing, he won’t be so charitable. So, while a different Djokovic might show up for the final, I like the Brit’s chances. Andy must stick with the aggressive game that has served him so well in getting this far, and the key for him is to stick with that big forehand and do what he did against Tomas Berdych. In the past he has shown a tendency to beat lesser opponents using his more defensive game and then tried to flick the switch towards a more attacking style when faced with the best. What has been encouraging here is that you could tell from the first round he was going to be aggressive. It is so much easier to keep that up and execute under pressure when you have been doing it from the start. Murray will look to flick on an attacking style of play when he plays against Djokovic . Murray has done a good job of putting pressure on his opponents’ first serve in this tournament. He is winning 36.6 per cent of first-serve return points, compared to 34 per cent in Melbourne last year. I have noticed quite a few changes. Murray’s first serve has been excellent and that has allowed him to play a lot more one-two combinations in the manner you associate with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer: get a fast and accurate first serve in and then follow it up with a big first strike. He has also shifted his court position slightly due to the confidence with which he is hitting his forehand. Often before, when the ball was in the middle of the court, he favoured his backhand side, but he’s been running around it more to hit the forehand — a sure sign of a feelgood factor. It has also been noticeable how many returns he has got back in play from first serves. Berdych had been serving outstandingly but he could not make that count enough in the semi. Of course, we know Andy is a great returner and a great mover, and in those departments he is back to what we saw in 2012 and up to Wimbledon 2013. All of the above must be replicated against Djokovic, as well as the way he has kept his frustrations to short flashes and recovered his composure when under pressure. He has got into a rhythm of playing his matches in the evenings since last Sunday’s fourth round on Rod Laver Arena. And it will not hurt that Novak had a long match, and didn’t finish media commitments until well past midnight. Right now, I’m thinking the final is what we call a ‘pick ’em’. In other words, a 50-50.","Andy Murray has lost seven of his last eight games against Novak Djokovic .

"A collection of surgical equipment that belonged to a Nazi concentration camp commandant is being put up for auction this week. The wooden box of tools . belonged to Anton Burger, a major in the SS who worked at the Theresienstadt concentration camp between July 1943 and February 1944, where 140,000 Jews were held  -  and 33,000 of them died. News of the sale has provoked outrage in the Jewish community. Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of Deputies, the main representative body of British Jews, said that 'to seek to profit from such ghoulish objects is deeply troubling'. Other Jewish groups, including the Anne Frank Trust and Holocaust Educational Trust, said that the collection should be placed in an educational context, such as a museum. Theresienstadt was used as a propaganda tool during the Second World War, with the Germans trying to fool the world that it was a 'paradise camp'. The wooden box of tools belonged to Anton Burger, a major in the SS who oversaw the Theresienstadt concentration camp between July 1943 and February 1944 . Disturbingly, given the contents of the box, there is no evidence that Sturmbannfuhrer Burger ever received medical training. A separate layer above the forked hooks reveals a sinister set of scissors . The case is marked 'instrumente gemischte', German for 'mixed instruments'. This has led to the theory it may have been part of the deception to fool the Red Cross into thinking it was for musical instruments . Austrian-born Burger was sentenced to death after the war but fled and lived under an assumed name, eventually dying in Germany in 1991 at the age of 80 . They even made a film showing happy . workers shoeing horses and making handbags, while children played . football or ate sandwiches to add to the deception. Burger played a key role in covering up the true horrors of the camp during stage-managed visits by the Red Cross - which were used to . help conceal the sickening purpose behind it and other camps from the watching . world. Disturbingly, given the contents of the . box, there is no evidence that Sturmbannfuhrer Burger ever received medical training. The mostly monogrammed equipment - which has a guide price of . £2,000 to £4,000 - has been . put up for sale at a small auction house in Bude, Cornwall, by an anonymous . seller. Grace Cloke, from Villa Hall Auctions, explained that the husband of the vendor . was Jewish, and his parents met and married at a concentration camp in Austria. Ms Cloke said: 'This set was always in . their home while they were married. 'He wouldn't talk about his history but he . used to spend a lot of time researching the Second World War.' The vendor's husband passed away . some years ago and she lost contact with his family so she still does not know . how he came to own the instruments. Ms Cloke added: 'The father [of the vendor's husband] used to deal during the war in the black market so we don't . know whether they were in the camp and were able to take it or whether it came . through the black market somehow,' she said. 'It is something we are never going . to know.' Theresienstadt, near what is now the town of Terezin in the Czech Republic, acted as a ghetto for 140,000 Jews, with 33,000 dying there during the war and 88,000 taken from it to extermination camps such as Auschwitz and murdered . Gillian . Walnes, executive director of the Anne Frank Trust UK . 'Inexplicably there are those who . have a grotesque fascination with Nazi memorabilia and instruments used to . inflict suffering on innocent adults and children. 'I . therefore hope that this item will be acquired by a respected museum or . academic institution that will use it for educational purposes.' Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of Deputies . 'There . is understandably a continuing fascination with this tragic part of our recent . history, and along with the countless books and films on the subject, from time . to time artefacts emerge that testify to the horrors of the Holocaust. 'These things serve to remind us of the terrible events that happened, and . incontrovertibly show the claims of Holocaust deniers for the lies that they . are. 'However, to seek to profit from such ghoulish objects, and to risk . that they might fall into the hands of admirers of the Nazis, is deeply . troubling. A more fitting home would be in a museum or suitable historical . archive somewhere.' Karen Pollock, chief executive . of the Holocaust Educational Trust . 'Wherever possible we believe . Holocaust-era items should be presented in an educational context, so that as . many people as possible can learn about what took place during that appalling . time.' The camp, near what is now the town of . Terezin in the Czech Republic, acted as a ghetto for 140,000 Jews, with 33,000 . dying there during the war and 88,000 taken from it to extermination camps such as . Auschwitz and murdered. Just 1,900 were still alive when the . ghetto was liberated by Soviet troops on May 7, 1945. Burger was ordered by SS leader Heinrich . Himmler and Adolf Eichmann, the orchestrator of the mass movement of Jews to camps . in Eastern Europe, to change the appearance of Theresienstadt to fool Red Cross . members who had requested access to a Nazi concentration camp. Many inmates were temporarily removed from . the overcrowded camp and cosmetic changes made to fool the inspectors. Fake shops and cafes were erected to give the . false impression that inmates had a life of relative comfort. The Red Cross representatives seemed to . fall for the deception and the Nazis went on to make a propaganda film at the . camp. The fact that the wooden instrument case . is marked 'instrumente gemischte', German for 'mixed . instruments', has led to the theory that this may have been made as part . of the deception, to suggest it was for musical instruments. 'Anton Burger was charged with . changing the appearance of the camp, and a lot of the Jews there were musical . so it is possible it was made to look like a musical instrument case,' Ms . Cloke said. Austrian-born Burger was sentenced to . death after the war but fled and lived under an assumed name, eventually dying . in Germany in 1991 at the age of 80. James Kendling from Villa Hall Auctions holds the macabre box, which was expected to fetch £2,000-£4,000 . It was only three years after his death, . in 1994, that anyone found out who the dead man really was. Ms Cloke said that the auction house was . aware of the sensitive nature of selling an item that once belonged to a Nazi . war criminal. Museums and other institutions across the . world have already shown an interest in the sale and Ms Cloke said they hoped . it would go to an organisation that would be able to use it in a positive, . educational setting. The collection is due to go on sale this Saturday.

"Inside a hotel room in this dreary industrial town in the Far East, a tearful Sebastian Vettel told his boss Christian Horner that he was leaving Red Bull for Ferrari, a deal that will earn him about £50million a year as the highest-paid driver in history. Nico Rosberg’s pole position ahead of today’s typhoon-threatened Japanese Grand Prix, a place ahead of his championship rival and Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, was a mere sideshow in a febrile paddock of intrigue, open cheque books and revolving doors. Vettel’s move was confirmed in a press release early yesterday morning Japanese time, just hours after Vettel texted Horner to ask if he could see him in his room. ‘I knew it wasn’t room service,’ said Horner with gallows humour of the 9.45pm message. Only minutes before he had confidently predicted Vettel would stay. Sebastian Vettel is pictured in the Red Bull garage during practice for the Japanese Grand Prix . Vettel will leave Red Bull at the end of the season after winning four drivers' titles . Vettel signs autographs ahead of this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka . The move is sure to affect the top end of the driver market over the next few months: . Fernando Alonso is almost certain to make way for Vettel at Ferrari, with McLaren his most likely destination. The McLaren management, including chairman Ron Dennis, who fell out with Alonso during his single year at the team in 2007, are willing to be reunited with the turbulent Spaniard. If Alonso does go to McLaren, rather than take a year’s sabbatical, he is likely to replace Jenson Button, possibly bringing an end to the Briton’s 15-year career in Formula One. McLaren sources have indicated privately that Alonso would be granted No 1 status and paired with a youthful No 2. Therefore, Kevin Magnussen, who only costs £500,000 a year, would stay and Button would go. The Mail on Sunday understands that Hamilton has agreed in principle a new deal to keep him at Mercedes through to the end of 2017.

Vettel is 117 points behind championship leader Lewis Hamilton and has decided to move on . Typhoon Phanfone threatens both the smooth-running of the Japanese Grand Prix race and the dash out of Japan. The worst effects of the storm are due to hit Suzuka late tonight or tomorrow, when the sport’s people, cars and freight are trying to travel 6,000 miles to Sochi for next week’s Russian Grand Prix. Regarding this Sunday's grand prix, an FIA spokesman said: ‘The timing for the organisers to change the race time has passed. We will see what is going on in the morning. The safety of the people has to be the most important thing.’ The possibility remains the race could run behind the safety car, with half-points an option should the race not be completed. Red Bull confirmed that Vettel’s place will be taken by 20-year-old Russian Daniil Kvyat from the start of next season. Ferrari will confirm Vettel in their driver line-up in the next few weeks. He will sign a three-year deal worth £150m. The Mail on Sunday understands Vettel negotiated his deal directly with Sergio Marchionne, the new president of Ferrari and chairman of the Scuderia’s parent company Fiat. Neither outgoing Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo nor team principal Marco Mattiacci was actively involved in negotiations. It is thought that Bernie Ecclestone, Vettel’s friend and mentor, advised the driver about the move. Vettel has no manager and negotiates his own highly lucrative deals. Asked about Ecclestone’s guidance, Vettel said: ‘Mind your own business.’ Despite wearing the grungy look of a student doing America on 10 dollars a day, Vettel is said to be protective about his money. A new father, to Emily, he lives quietly on a farm in the tax haven of Switzerland, enjoying his privacy as much as his hero Michael Schumacher, whose feats at Ferrari he aspires to recreate. Daniil Kvyat will replace Vettel at Red Bull, moving from the sister team Toro Rosso . Kvyat has impressed in his first season in Formula 1 and will get his chance with Red Bull next season . It is understood that Vettel started to seek a move away following the Italian Grand Prix at the start of September. In his five years with Red Bull, he won four world drivers’ titles and helped them to four constructors’ championships. But he suffered dents to his stellar reputation this season after being regularly outclassed by team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, who has won three races to the German’s none. Although Red Bull have massively outperformed Ferrari, they have not managed to match the dominance of Mercedes. That was the case again in qualifying yesterday, with Rosberg and Hamilton annexing the front row of the grid. Rosberg was supremely quick on the most testing track in the world, finishing two-tenths of a second ahead of his title rival. Rosberg suffered electrical problems at the last race in Singapore, allowing Hamilton to take a three-point lead, but he is far from crushed. That is more than could be said for Hamilton’s car after he broke his front suspension when he crashed into the tyre wall after carrying too much speed into the first corner in practice. ‘Nico was extremely quick today,’ admitted Hamilton. ‘I did the best I could. The guys did a great job to rebuild the car after I binned it. Today I just wasn’t feeling it. I don’t know why. Tomorrow is the day where you get the points so I’m looking forward to all the tricky weather.’ As for Vettel, he will start ninth, three places behind Ricciardo. But, naturally, he was still smiling. Laughing, in fact, all the way to the bank.

"Simon Cowell's pregnant, married lover Lauren Silverman is set to get a share of the multi-million dollar pre-nup she signed before marrying Andrew Silverman - despite breaking a cheating clause. The 36-year-old socialite, who is expecting a baby with the music mogul, has held 'productive conversations' with her estranged husband as they continue to thrash out their divorce agreement. And the couple- who spent the weekend locked in talks at their rental home in the Hamptons - are also working on plans to share custody of their seven-year-old son Adam. Today, a source told MailOnline: 'There have been productive conversations over the weekend. 'Lauren and Andrew are intent on resolving this - and Simon also wants it resolved.' Far away: Lauren Silverman leaves lunch at Ambroeus restaurant in Southampton, New York, today while her lover Simon Cowell is thousands of miles away in Europe. He is keen that she settles her divorce soon . Sombre: Lauren Silverman showed off her figure in a clingy striped sundress as she enjoyed lunch with a friend in Southampton - however, she failed to raise a smile . As MailOnline revealed, the X Factor . supremo, 53, jetted out of Los Angeles on Friday, watching his band One . Direction in concert in Las Vegas on Saturday night before heading to . Europe, where he will spend the month on board the Slipstream yacht, . touring St Tropez. He . is believed to want to give his lover space in order to work out her . divorce case. If the case is settled somewhat amicably, then it will . avoid an ugly court battle, in which Cowell could be dragged into - and . any embarrassing secrets exposed. The . New York Post reported that Lauren waited until her 10th wedding . anniversary to break the news of her affair with Cowell to her husband . so the terms of her pre-nup would kick in. And . a source again insisted today that Lauren tried to 'max out her return . by stringing things along past the 10 year mark to increase what she . would be eligible to receive.

Lauren today appeared outside the Bridgehampton home where she is staying with her husband and son. The striking brunette, wearing a sweatshirt and baseball cap, smiled as her son was picked up for summer camp. She then headed to lunch with a friend in nearby Southampton, where she had donned a clingy striped sun dress, with a black bikini top underneath. Lauren is now being represented by Bernard Clair - named as one of '10 lawyers you don't want representing your spouse in a divorce' - by Business Insider. Mr Clair famously represented socialite Jocelyn Wildenstein in her divorce from Alec Nathan Wildensteain, New York designer Carolyn Roehm, and Republican fundraiser Georgette Mosbacher. Thrashing it out: Lauren is said to be trying to reach an amicable agreement with estranged husband Andrew over their divorce . While Andrew Silverman is being represented Jeffrey Cohen of Cohen Goldstein Silpe. As previously revealed, his parents Eleanora and Allen refused to attend the wedding in 2003 in the fabulously elegant old-money confines of the St Regis hotel in Manhattan’s Midtown. According to a friend, the Silvermans 'did not approve of the relationship, they didn't have a good feeling about Lauren and the relationship.' Lauren did her utmost to take her mind off her situation over . the weekend, as she headed out for a spot of retail therapy. She wore a fitted yellow minidress as she was joined by her sister . and son Adam as the group browsed the local shops in Bridgehampton, New . York. Lauren's outing . came as Cowell headed to St Tropez, where he is expected to spend the . next month alongside ex-girlfriends including Sinitta. Cowell will . tour Europe and take time to evaluate how exactly to proceed after it . was revealed last week that New York socialite Lauren - married to his . friend Andrew - is expecting his baby. Ironically, . it was on board the $458,000-a-week Slipstream that Cowell was pictured . sharing a tender embrace with Lauren last August, in images that came . to light last week. Despite the St Tropez trip, Cowell is also expected to fly to . Britain within the next few days to meet up with his 87-year-old mother Julie and brother . Nick to discuss the pregnancy and his plans for the future. Prior to heading to St Tropez, Cowell . was seen taking his mind off the drama in his personal life by . attending a One Direction concert in Las Vegas on Saturday night. He was spotted mingling . with fans, standing alongside a male friend, as he stood in the audience . and watched his X Factor stars perform in the city - while his lover stayed on the East Coast.

A . friend close to Andrew Silverman told the New York Post that the idea that he . knew about his wife's relationship with Cowell is 'ridiculous' and 'she . knows this isn't true.' Lauren's accusations that her husband . messed around, partying with girls all over the world, is only adding . fuel to their bitter custody battle over son Adam. Andrew's friend said that it sounds like a 'desperate attempt to smear him.' The statement was in response to an earlier TMZ report that said Andrew knew about the affair all along. They . said Lauren was 'outraged' that when he feigned shock at pictures of . the Hamptons socialite kissing Simon on a yacht last year. The . website reported that Lauren has alleged to close friends that Andrew . 'knew what was going on the whole time and he was doing the same thing.' Laying low: Simon Cowell left his Los Angeles home on Friday night for a month-long trip to Europe . Escape route: Cowell had to deflect questions about the baby at the X Factor TCA press tour last week and he will soon enjoy a month long vacation - with the harem of course . While . Lauren's pregnancy is still in early days, Cowell is said to be . concerned about the strain the situation and publicity could put on the . socialite. The . pair are in a relationship, as MailOnline revealed, but . another friend said: 'At the moment, Lauren and Andrew need to thrash . out their divorce - Lauren can't just go running off to be with Simon, . as much as she wants to be with him. 'All sides want the divorce to go through as quickly as can be.' Furore: The X Factor star is having a baby with Lauren Silverman, a married New York socialite .

It remains to be seen just how the . news that he is to be a father will go down with Cowell, who has never . made a secret of the fact that he doesn't believe he is the right . material to become a parent.

Neil Warnock chose his words carefully given he already has one FA charge relating to referees hanging over his head, but his anger at the officiating following this dramatic draw was clear. Never one to shy away from emphatic statements, the Crystal Palace manager claimed Craig Dawson’s challenge on Julian Speroni in the midst of Victor Anichebe’s goal was tantamount to ‘assault’. Saido Berahino scored a late equaliser to hand his side a point against Crystal Palace at The Hawthorns . Substitute goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey dived the right way but was unable to save Berahino's spot-kick . Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak scored from the penalty spot to extend his side's lead .

Bert Trautmann, who broke his neck in the 1956 FA Cup final, got a mention. The goal, six minutes after the interval, sliced Palace’s 2-0 lead in half to set up a last-gasp equaliser from the penalty spot by Saido Berahino. His composed finish, in the third minute of added time, only enhanced his reputation as well as his standing as England’s leading marksman in the top-flight. Seven in the Premier League now, Roy Hodgson will note. Warnock had no complaints that referee Mark Clattenburg pointed to the spot when Mile Jedinak foolishly slid in on Anichebe as he shaped to shoot. But he complained that Clattenburg had failed to act when Dawson tripped Wilfried Zaha in the area in the first half. Having accused referee Craig Pawson of being influenced by Chelsea players last weekend, none of his Palace players tried to apply any pressure. ‘It’s a certain penalty,’ Warnock said ‘You can’t win. We had four or five Chelsea lads surrounding the referee last week and we were told that was wrong. I don’t want my lads to start going silly.’ On the Speroni incident he said: ‘It’s just like an assault. Dawson goes for two or three yards with his elbow and smashes him in the face. I’ve not seen one of them since Bert Trautmann, it’s ridiculous.’ That description is exaggerated to say the least but it is true that another referee may have blown for a foul as the players collided following Chris Brunt’s corner. Speroni was down for three minutes receiving treatment but wanted to continue. Warnock overruled and dragged his goalkeeper off. ‘He’s telling the physio, “I’ll be alright” and I didn’t want to risk it,’ Warnock said. ‘Once they’d scored I thought they’d try the same again. The only one to give him some protection was me.’ Alan Irvine believed the incident was no more severe than when bodies came together for Palace’s opening goal in the 16th minute. Brede Hangeland headed Yannick Bolasie’s corner into Dawson, then prodded the rebound in with his right boot. ‘I looked at the referee on both occasions and neither time he gave a free-kick,’ said Irvine. ‘There was an awful lot of players flying in at those inswinging corners. I thought the contact was after the ball had been headed by Victor.’ Berahino put in a hard working display against the Baggies as seen on the above heat map.

Fraizer Campbell            90          10.8      6.7 . Palace built on their lead shortly before the interval when Sebastien Pocognoli slid in desperately on Bolasie. Jedinak strode forward and sent Foster the wrong way. In the end a draw seemed fair, certainly once Anichebe arrived at half-time in place of Stephane Sessegnon to change the complexion of this match. It was Anichebe's first goal of the season after recovering from a groin injury and Irvine felt he played a major part. He said: 'There's no doubt Victor made a difference and before the game I thought we might need him. Having watched Palace and looked at their strengths and the way they are able to play I felt Victor would be needed at some point.' Irvine admitted, though, he had to get angry with his side after their first-half no show. He said: 'They did see another side to me, one which doesn't come out very often but has to come out from time to time. 'I was bitterly disappointed with the first 32 minutes of the game. We conceded the penalty on a counter attack but for the first 32 minutes we were awful. After that we did what we were supposed to be doing and we eventually got a reward for that.' Palace, meanwhile, are on the brink of being taken over by American entrepreneur Josh Harris, the owner of the New Jersey Devils and Philadelphia 76ers. Warnock had an opinion on that too. ‘If the billionaire is in the background I’m sure we’ll be looking for telephone numbers,’ he said. A busy January might beckon.

"I doubt that Tomas Berdych will be saying anything to Andy Murray again on court in a hurry. His brief few words as they changed over at the end of the first set created the perfect double whammy — it did him as much harm as it did Murray good. I am aware that I said prior to the match that Andy should not let this get personal, but the fact is the timing of Berdych’s remark was so perfect for Murray — and disastrous from the Czech’s point of view — that it swung the match around. Both players had invested so much in the first set, which was over an hour-and-a-quarter of really hard tennis, that it was massive for Tomas to win it. Tomas Berdych stares at his opponent Andy Murray during their tense Australian Open semi-final . You can be sure that he will have been pumped and his opponent deflated, especially as Andy knew he had chances to take it. I was surprised that Berdych initiated it because confrontation is not really in his character and his level completely dropped afterwards. He virtually donated the next two games and lost 16 out of the next 20 points. Murray celebrates victory against Berdych (left) and acknowledges coach Amelie Mauresmo's role (right) As for Andy, the incident just helped him forget those 76 long minutes after which he had ended up with nothing. Instead of being down on himself he got fired up all over again and started playing more positively, especially on his forehand side. He rode this momentum all the way through the next two sets and, as I predicted beforehand, ended up winning in four. It was not a big altercation but the key thing was that it suited Andy’s personality while it did not suit Tomas at all. Murray had actually been as emotional for a first set as I recall, so he was up for this from the start. He could have faded after that lost tiebreak but his opponent unwittingly ensured that it did not happen. Tomas Berdych looks in the zone after taking the first set on a tie-break against Andy Murray on Thursday . However Berdych floundered after the first set to fall to a 6-7 (6-8), 6-0, 6-3, 7-5 defeat to Andy Murray .","Andy Murray beat Tomas Berdych 6-7 (6-8), 6-0, 6-3, 7-5 in the semi-final .

"The running of Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix remains a threat as organisers are still unsure of the impact Typhoon Phanfone will have on Suzuka and the surrounding areas. The typhoon has been building over the Pacific Ocean throughout the week and is expected to bring rain and heavy winds to the track - which could severely challenge the race. With the lights due to go out at 15:00 local time, there is little room for pushing the start back, as dusk falls fairly soon after the end of the grand prix. L-r: Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Valtteri Bottas after qualifying in Japan . Nico Rosberg (left) with his crew members on the way to taking pole in the Japanese Grand Prix . An FIA spokesman explained why the race could not be moved, with Sunday morning or later on Saturday night originally mooted as potential options. 'The timing for the organisers to change the time the race is held has passed,' he said. 'We will see what is going on in the morning. If that is a storm, what are you going to do? The safety of the people, the spectators has to logically be the most important thing.' The situation is ever-changing, with the typhoon upgraded from a category one hurricane up to a category four inside 12 hours. It has also been at 'super typhoon' levels after reaching winds of 150mph and the FIA is in constant contact with their forecasters. Mercedes' Nico Rosberg takes the acclaim after clinching pole position in Suzuka . Ferrari's Fernando Alonso walks out from his pit after the qualifying session . Championship leader Lewis Hamilton makes his way around the Japanese circuit . 'Our team are monitoring at all times,' the spokesman added. 'Everyone is trying to make sure the race can go ahead - but it will go ahead only if conditions in and around the circuit are safe.' There remains the possibility that the race could run behind the safety car if the weather was bad enough to warrant it - with half-points also an option should the entire race not be able to be completed. Either way it adds another intriguing factor into the title battle between Mercedes pair Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton ahead of what will prove to be an interesting day.","Organisers still unsure the impact Typhoon Phonfone will have on Suzuka .

"Juan Mata has revealed Manchester United’s stars are still getting to grips with Louis van Gaal’s style of football. Spanish playmaker Mata insisted that his team-mates are fully behind the manager as the club remain locked in a struggle for a Champions League place. Some United fans are unconvinced by Van Gaal’s tactics and during their last Premier League match chanted ‘4-4-2’ after the Dutchman had again opted for his favoured 3-5-2. Manchester United playmaker Juan Mata (centre) admits players are still getting used to Louis van Gaal . The Dutch manager has switched between 3-5-2 and 4-4-2 formations this season . He switched to the more traditional format after the break and watched his side win 2-0 at Loftus Road. But on Friday night in the FA Cup, in a 4-4-2 from the start, United could not find a way past League Two Cambridge and will now face a replay at Old Trafford after a disappointing 0-0 draw at the Abbey Stadium. Speaking to the club’s website, Mata, who was rested for the FA Cup clash, is confident Van Gaal will get things right. ‘I think we are all learning from the manager,’ he said. ‘He is a great character and a great coach. The way he wants to play football is the right way, which is an attacking way. Despite a multi-million pound line-up, United could not overcome lowly Cambridge United in the FA Cup . The Spain international insists that Van Gaal's football philosophy will eventually bring rewards . ‘That means we try to work hard with the ball, try to create space to pass the ball quickly and to switch it from side to side. I really like the way he sees football and we are all trying to do our best for him, the staff and for Ryan [Giggs].’ Mata joined from Chelsea a year ago for a then club record £37.1m. And he says that the size of United continues to amaze him. ‘The pre-season tour made me realise how big the club is,’ he said. ‘Once we were on the tour and travelling around, we saw how many supporters we had against teams like Real Madrid and Inter Milan. We had more fans than anyone in the States. I expect places like Asia and Australia are the same – it’s unbelievable the support we get around the world.’ Mata remembers his first game against Cardiff City after arriving in a surprise move from Chelsea . Mata admits being blown away by United's popularity during the club's pre-season tour of the US . Mata highlights United's victory at Newcastle away last season as one of his best performances . Looking back over his 12 months, Mata was asked for his favourite match and goal. ‘I always remember my first game against Cardiff,’ he said. ‘We’ve had some good games, such as Newcastle away (last season) and Liverpool at home this season. There have been some good games personally and for the team. ‘I liked the two free-kicks I scored at Newcastle and Southampton last season. They were good goals.’","Louis van Gaal is still getting his philosophy across at Manchester United .

Brazil were 5-0 down at half-time after Thomas Muller, Miroslav Klose, Toni Kroos (2) and Sami Khedira scored in a remarkable 18 minute spell. Andre Schurrle added two more after the break and Brazilian forward Oscar responded in the final minute as the host nation were booed off the field.

Scolari, who insists he will not resign after this shameful defeat, said: ‘My message is, to the Brazilian people and fans, that we did and we tried to do what we could. ‘Please excuse us for this mistake. I’m sorry we couldn’t get to the final. This is a catastrophe. ‘It’s probably the worst moment of my career. This is the worst day of my life, but life goes on. ‘I’ll be remembered probably because I lost 7-1, the worst defeat Brazil have ever had, but that was a risk I knew I was running when I accepted this position. Life goes on. That’s what I’ll do. ‘We did what we thought was our best, and we lost to a great team that had the team, in six or seven minutes, to end the game with three or four goals in extraordinary manner. ‘I can tell you that, after the first goal, we had a problem and, with the skills of a team who have been working together for a long time, they capitalised on it. ‘We will continue working and honouring what our team means for the third place match in Brasilia. ‘I’d like to thank the supporters for supporting the players despite us losing by five, six, seven. It was interesting to see that happen.’ Emotional: Luiz was struggling to hold back the tears as he was interviewed on television after the defeat . Comforted: Luiz is consoled as he leaves the field after Brazil's semi-final humbling . Scolari, who was without injured Neymar and suspended skipper Thiago Silva, took full responsibility for the manner of the defeat. Brazil will now travel to Brasilia to play the loser of Wednesday evening’s semi-final in Sao Paulo between Argentina and Holland for the third and fourth place play-off. He added: ‘Who is responsible when the team plays? Who is invited to be the coach? Who is responsible for picking the team? I am. It’s me. So the catastrophic result can be shared by the whole group. ‘My players will tell you we will share our responsibilities. But who decided the tactics, I did. So the person responsible is me. ‘I don’t have any debt to the country. I did my job as I always have. I did what I thought was best. ‘We had one defeat today.

Despair: Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari looks helpless as he watches his side crumble against Germany . Crestfallen: Scolari was gesturing to himself on the touchline as Brazil conceded five first-half goals . ‘Yes, it was a terrible defeat in terms of the result, 7-1, but at 5-0, you try and rally to pull some goals back. ‘That leaves you open to further disaster. In 2002, we won. Great. Now we’ve lost. But it was my choice. I made the choices. Me. Don’t forget there’s a match on Saturday, though. We can be third, so we still have a match to play.’ Stand-in captain David Luiz was in tears again at the final whistle and they were booed off the pitch when they turned to applaud the Brazil supporters. Luiz said: ‘I wanted to give pleasure only for my people. All those who suffered so much, I want to apologise to every Brazilian.’ Down and out: Julio Cesar struggled to explain Brazil's embarrassing exit . Gutted: Cesar and his Brazil team-mates look dejected at the final whistle . Celebration: Germany coach Joachim Low screams with joy as he watches his side thrash Brazil 7-1 .

Kroos struck twice before 26 minutes had been played and Khedira added the fifth after 29 minutes. Scolari added: ‘No-one could change anything. It was one after the other.

Embrace: Low (right) shakes hands with record-breaking striker Klose (left) as he substitutes for forward . Scolari also insisted that the absence of Neymar had nothing to do with the shambolic performance in the semi-final. He added: ‘Let’s not try to find an excuse in Neymar or the emotions of the anthem. ‘What happened was Germany imposed a fantastic rhythm on the game.

"Liverpool find themselves outside the top four and unlikely to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League after two games in four days at Anfield in which they have failed to score against Real Madrid and Hull City. Joe Bernstein assesses how Brendan Rodgers can fix the problems currently afflicting the club. MARIO BALOTELLI AS SUAREZ'S REPLACEMENT . You can't say Liverpool weren't warned the Uruguayan would go one day. But by pebble-dashing their summer spending on a number of squad players instead of one A-lister, they've come up short. With Daniel Sturridge injured, Mario Balotelli has been tried as the main source of goals, and failed. But it's not all the Italian's fault. Asking him to make Suarez-style runs in a free-flowing attack is like picking Usain Bolt for the Olympics and telling him to compete in the 5,000metres. Balotelli's strength is his strength, feeling the defenders up against him and physically turning them. Rodgers must either leave Balotelli out or change Liverpool's style until Sturridge returns. Even Fabio Borini would be a better bet. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch... Brendan Rodgers has to solve Mario Balotelli's goal drought as he looks to replace the excellent Luis Suarez . Balotelli has been tried as the main source of goals and failed at last year's Premier League runners up so far . SIMON MIGNOLET LEAVING THE DEFENCE STRESSED . Simon Mignolet makes an excellent sweeper-keeper in terms of having great feet for a goalkeeper. It's the way many managers want to go in the modern game so that they play a high defensive line. Unfortunately, Mignolet's deficiencies, not commanding his penalty area and questionable communication, have left the back-four jittery. Rodgers would be better off going back to basics and spending £10million on a traditional, strong goalkeeper like Asmir Begovic, even if he isn't as good a footballer as Mignolet. Simon Mignolet's deficiencies have left Liverpool's back four shaken and the goalkeeper must turn it around . STEVEN GERRARD A FADING FORCE . Gerrard can still dictate the tempo of the game when he's allowed to. But opponents aren't stupid, they will try to find a way of capitalising on his lack of mobility at the age of 34. If Gerrard is going to play in front of the back-four, he needs legs alongside him – and that means Jordan Henderson rather than Joe Allen or Lucas. With Henderson on the bench on Saturday, it was noticeable how much more energy Hull had in their midfield, particularly Mo Diame. It was only after Henderson came on that Gerrard burst into late life. Steven Gerrard can still dictate the tempo of the game but only when the Liverpool captain is allowed to . Opponents seem to have sussed a way to limit the 34-year-old Gerrard's lack of mobility for Liverpool . THE RAHEEM STERLING 'CRISIS' Raheem Sterling arrived back from the World Cup the great hope of English football. But for every great performance this season, and there have been some, there have also been patchy displays, an unwise link to Real Madrid while contract negotiations are underway and claims from England manager Roy Hodgson that the player had told him he was tired. At 19, Sterling is a good winger and a good No 10. But it's too much for him to switch from one to another with regularity. For this season, Rodgers should tell Sterling where he wants him to play – and stick to hit. He needs stability. There have been patchy displays by Raheem Sterling so far and an unwise link to La Liga giants Real Madrid . At 19, Sterling is a good winger and a good No 10, but it's too much for him to switch from one to another . MIXED-UP STYLE . Liverpool's pattern of play was uncomplicated last season, and thrilling. Suarez, Sturridge and Sterling tore defences apart, Henderson and Gerrard dictated the play, they scored more than the opposition. But Liverpool have lost a bit of their identity with the number of new signings made. The addition of the Champions League means certain new signings like Adam Lallana haven't been given a run of matches to adjust to life at Anfield. It's difficult because modern football requires some rotation but Rodgers should surely stick to his best XI for a few games at least to establish rhythm. Then he can make changes.

"Motor racing’s governing body, the FIA, are hoping to trial ‘speed limits’ at the next race in Austin, Texas, as they seek to improve safety after the horrific crash that has left Marussia’s Jules Bianchi fighting for his life. Bianchi veered off at the Japanese Grand Prix last week, despite double yellow flags being waved to slow him down. He hit a recovery vehicle and was taken to hospital for emergency brain surgery. Race director Charlie Whiting presented a report on the accident to FIA president Jean Todt this weekend. Medical staff rush to the scene of Jules Bianchi's crash at the Japanese Grand Prix . The Marussia driver was taken to hospital with severe head injuries after the freak accident . Imposing a speed limit under yellow and double yellow flags is a suggestion that is expected to be tried out in practice at Texas in three weeks’ time. Lewis Hamilton said: ‘We had a drivers’ meeting with Jean Todt. One of the ideas that came out was based on when you go karting with electric karts. When the flags come out the engines are limited. ‘I think that’s quite good. What’s good is they are reacting to it and finding the best solution.’ Lewis Hamilton revealed that talks have taken place between drivers over safety measures .","FIA are hoping to trial speed limits at the US Grand Prix in Texas .

"Two-year-old Sophie Jones died after digesting the heroin substitute . A two-year-old girl died after drinking her drug addict parents' methadone which was kept in Tom and Jerry cups and Fruit Shoot bottles, a court has heard. Sophie Jones was found covered in vomit by paramedics at her parents home in Blackpool in March after digesting the heroin-substitute. She was rushed to hospital but pronounced dead less than an hour later after digesting the lethal substance, Preston Crown Court heard. Her parents Michelle King, 29, who was also allegedly selling the substance, admitted manslaughter. Her partner, 41-year-old Barry Jones, denies the offence and is standing trial. The court was told King, a known heroin addict, began selling her prescribed dosage of methadone instead of taking it herself, storing the lethal substance in children's cups and Fruit Shoot bottles. She would use the money to buy other drugs including cocaine, traces of which were found on the toddler's dummy during tests following her death. Prosecuting Jeremy Grout-Smith said: 'Both parents have been users of heroin and crack cocaine for some years and were habitually taking these drugs at the time of Sophie's death. 'Michelle King was prescribed methadone, which is heroin replacement. 'Sophie died from drinking the methadone, which she drank from a child's plastic drinking cup. 'She died because of the carelessness and neglect of her parents. 'The risk of the contamination that took place must have been obvious.' At around 11.40pm on March 4 Jones phoned an ambulance telling operators his daughter had stopped breathing. Three minutes later paramedics arrived to find the toddler lying on the floor, covered in vomit. The toddler's parents Michelle King (left) and Barry Jones (right) allegedly knew she was unwell and tried to cover up the fact she had ingested methadone before police searched their home, the court heard . Paramedics arrived at the couple's home to find two-year-old Sophie 'covered in vomit' and 'unresponsive' 'There was vomit in her hair, on her face, chest and on the floor that appeared to contain blood. 'Paramedics thought she was already dead,' Mr Grout-Smith said. Earlier that day King's mother had visited the family and noticed Sophie being 'unsteady on her feet'. She allegedly told her daughter, 'I hope you haven't left the lid off your tablets.' 'Jean saw Sophie fall at least once while she was at the house. 'She was concerned about Sophie and thought they should call an ambulance. 'They told her they would take Sophie to the medical centre later that day. 'After they had left, Jones phoned his mother and told her they had taken Sophie to the centre but that was untrue. 'They both knew she was unwell because of the drug she had taken and they knew that would be diagnosed by medical staff. 'They knew they were at fault. 'They were both aware that Sophie had been put into a deep slumber,' Mr Grout Smith added. The toddler's mother sent a series of text messages to another drug user reminding her that she was owed £25 on the day of her child's death, it was alleged. King, a known heroin addict, was selling her prescribed dosage of methadone to other addicts when her child died, the court heard . Traces of cocaine were also allegedly found on the toddler's dummy following an examination of the couple's home . Cuddly toys and flowers are left outside the home where the toddler died in March this year after digesting methadone . The court heard how the child's grandmother visited the day before her death and noted she looked unstable . A quantity of methadone was found in the couple's back garden when police searched the property . After their daughter was pronounced dead, the couple told police they feared she had drank cider that her grandmother's partner had brought to the house. King allegedly sent a text message to her partner following their daughter's death telling him to dispose of 'all the meth bottles out back under green thing. Another said 'don't tip meth out hide it', the court heard. The court heard how King allegedly stored methadone in empty Fruit Shoot bottles (file image) 'Prior to the 999 call made at 11:40 there had also been an attempt to clear the house of incriminating evidence - the child's drinking cup with methadone and had been put under a sheet in the backyard of the house, bins with shoot bottles in have been moved outside from the back of the house to the end of the street away from their house. 'The neighbour noticed that the water running the upstairs sink for significant period of time. 'It must've been a joint attempt by both defendants to clear up the house. They were acting together to clear the house of any incriminating evidence they were both aware she had been put into a deep slumber had not woken up - they needed to protect themselves. 'It is significant there were no phone calls for a period of one hour between 10:45 and the 999 call at 11:40. In the context of the usual use of phone it was an unusual silent,' Mr Grout-Smith added. Tests later showed Sophie had traces of four separate drugs in her hair. Three of her dummies had traces of cocaine powder on the teat. Methadone was also found on an upstairs bathroom sink. Officer searching the couple's home discovered 146ml of the heroin substitute in their back garden. Just 5ml of the substance is enough to harm a child of Sophie's age, the court heard. High traces of methadone were found in the child's blood following a post-mortem examination. As none was found in her stomach, pathologists suggested she had digested the substance by the time of her death. She died from poisoning by methadone which led her to fall unconscious and inhale the stomach's contents into her lungs. The trial continues.

"Lewis Hamilton insisted he felt comfortable in chasing down and passing title rival Nico Rosberg at a rainy Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday. The race in Suzuka was overshadowed by a crash involving Marussia's Jules Bianchi, who was left requiring surgery after suffering severe head injuries following a collision with a recovery vehicle. But, in terms of the now trivial battle between the Mercedes duo for this year's drivers' championship, Hamilton was the man to come out on top - picking up a third consecutive win to move 10 points clear of his German colleague. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Peter Windsor on Jules Bianchi crash at Sazuka . Lewis Hamilton holds up the trophy after winning the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka on Sunday . With Typhoon Phanfone sending plenty of wet weather towards the circuit, the race was red-flagged after just two laps despite starting under safety car conditions. Hamilton set about passing pole-sitter Rosberg once enough standing water had been cleared to allow the race to begin in earnest. And, even though he was following closely behind his team-mate for several laps, Hamilton felt in control of the race. 'Nico and I had a tough battle, we were pushing really hard,' he said. 'I had a big moment at turn one when I was too late getting off the DRS as I was just pushing so hard but fortunately I was able to get back on track. 'The conditions were difficult throughout but I had more pace than Nico and could follow him quite comfortably in the early stages. Nico Rosberg leads Mercedes team-mate Hamilton in the early stages in wet conditions at Suzuka . 'This is not an easy circuit for following another car or for overtaking, but he made a mistake out of the last corner and I was able to pass. The whole approach then needed to change to look after the tyres and make sure I stayed in the lead until the end of the race.' This was Hamilton's maiden victory at Suzuka and comes at a crucial time in his quest for a second world championship. Rosberg had out-performed the Brit in Saturday's dry qualifying session but was left conceding it was a case of ""damaged limitations"" after he came out second-best on race day. 'I struggled a lot with the balance of my car on the intermediate tyres, so I had to push hard to keep Lewis behind me,' he said. 'I had a lot of oversteering which is why the rear end of my car was very nervous. That was really strange and I didn't have the necessary confidence in the corners; we need to look into that in the next few days. Hamilton (centre) is on top of the podium alongside Rosberg (left) and Sebastian Vettel . 'It meant that Lewis was quicker today and deserved the win. It was damage limitation with losing only seven points to him. For the team it was a good result with another one-two.' Sebastian Vettel, who announced on Saturday he was to leave Red Bull at the end of the season, took the final place on the podium after being the fastest man on track during the middle stages of the race. His team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, who will lead the team when Vettel completes his widely-anticipated move to Ferrari, was fourth with Jenson Button unfortunate to only come home fifth having enjoyed one of his best performances of the season. The 2009 champion peeled off into the pits to change from full wet tyres and onto the intermediate option as soon as the safety car had come in. Hamilton negotiates tough conditions before emerging victorious for his maiden victory at Suzuka . And Button benefited from the decision as those left on track followed his lead - with the McLaren man moving up into third place as a result. The ultimately superior pace of the Red Bull duo meant the 34-year-old could not take his first podium since the opening race in Australia, with his future still a mystery as rumours Fernando Alonso is to return to the Woking-based team. But McLaren race director Eric Boullier was happy with the performance of Button, as the team continues to fight with Force India over fifth place in the constructors's standings. Jenson Button put in one of his best performances of the season to finish in fifth place . 'Jenson was the first driver in the field to stop to fit Intermediates, and, having done so, thereafter he drove very well all afternoon,' said Boullier. 'Indeed, he may well have finished third had things panned out better for us at the end of the race in terms of Safety Car and pit-stop timing. 'Even so, the 10 points he scored for fifth place may well be useful to us in our efforts to move up the Constructors' Championship table.'","Lewis Hamilton won the Japanese Grand Prix to move 10 points clear of Nico Rosberg .

"Sol Campbell has backed former England team-mate and QPR defender Rio Ferdinand to defy his critics and prove his worth after a disappointing start to life at Loftus Road. Ferdinand joined Rangers on a one-year deal in July, linking up with his former West Ham boss Harry Redknapp in the process, after 12 successful years at Manchester United. However, things haven’t entirely gone to plan for the 35-year-old, with him coming under a barrage of criticism for his performances so far this season as the R’s sit rock-bottom of the Premier League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Harry Redknapp: Rio Ferdinand is the ultimate professional . Rio Ferdinand has received the backing of Sol Campbell as he struggles for form in QPR's defence . Campbell, who played alongside Ferdinand for England, said he can still cut it in the Premier League . Campbell, who built up a formidable partnership with Ferdinand at the heart of the Three Lions defence in the 1990s, still believes the former England captain has plenty to offer at the highest level. When speaking to Sportsmail at the London Sports Writing Festival he said: ‘I have no doubt in my mind that Rio can still compete at the top. ‘I came back to Arsenal when I was 35 and played at the highest level for six months so why can't he? ‘At that time I felt I was the best defender around in the second half of that season (2009-2010) too and should have gone to the World Cup, so there’s no reason why Rio can’t have a similar impact to that at QPR. Ferdinand went on The Jonathan Ross Show to announce he would be retiring at the end of the season . Ferdinand was dropped by manager Harry Redknapp to the bench for QPR's defeat to Liverpool last Sunday . ‘Once Rio gets what QPR are and the club understand him, everything will be fine.’ Considering QPR’s current plight, supporters wouldn't have been entirely pleased to have heard Ferdinand reveal his intention to hang up his boots at the end of the current season on The Jonathan Ross show aired on Saturday night. However, Campbell has backed Ferdinand to win over the R’s faithful, and says they must remain patient with him as he adjusts to surroundings at the club. He added: ‘I don’t think anyone can question Rio’s hunger and desire for the game – he’s a top professional. I think people have to remember that he is getting on now - he’s not a 21-year-old anymore. ‘Once you go into the latter stages of your career you have to take extra care of yourself. There’s a completely different way of approaching the game. Ferdinand and Campbell were rock solid at the heart of the England defence for many years . Campbell (right) returned to Arsenal at the age of 35 and proved he could still perform at the top level . ‘There’s a way of playing, resting, looking after your body - it’s totally different. Harry (Redknapp) will know that. ‘When Arsene Wenger brought me back to Arsenal he had to manage me in a completely different way to when I was at the club before. ‘I was obviously getting fit in pre-season, but I wasn’t training every day. I would play and then rest and have a warm down. As long as you’re ready for the game it’s fine. ‘If you need your rest period you need it at the end of the day. There’s always a way of working around it though and I’m sure QPR and Rio will realise that and reap the rewards in the end.’","Sol Campbell has backed Rio Ferdinand to find form at QPR .

"Former Corrie actor Bruce Jones has been spotted looking worse for wear during a drinking session despite claiming on TV he was beating his battle with booze and depression. The star, who played the Street's resident drunk Les Battersby, was caught on camera leaving a pub just 36 hours before he appeared on ITV show Daybreak saying 'I feel great'. Mr Jones had headed to the drinking hole after he made a brief appearance on Keith Lemon's ITV2 panel show Celebrity Juice, arriving on set at 8.30pm. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Caught on camera: Coronation street Star Bruce Jones was spotted leaving the Chancellors pub in West London just 36 hours before he told Daybreak viewers he was beating his alcohol demons . Revealing: Former Coronation Street Actor was seen leaving a pub just 36 hours before he told Daybreak presenters Aled Jones and Kate Garraway that he was overcoming his problems with alcohol and depression . The 60-year-old was then said to have visited the nearby Chancellors pub, leaving the West London establishment at 9.30pm, the Daily Mirror newspaper reported. He then joined friends in the bar at . the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, where Celebrity Juice was filmed, . and was seen knocking back pints of Meantime beer. Mr Jones, who played Les Battersby between 1997 and 2007, was later heard telling his drinking partners that he feared he had been photographed leaving the Chancellors pub. Yesterday the father-of-four appeared on ITV breakfast show Daybreak, having been booked to chat about his battles with alcohol and depression. In the live interview with presenters Aled Jones and Kate Garraway, Mr Jones told how he felt he had turned a corner after hitting rock bottom in 2009 when he tried to kill both himself and his wife Sandra by drunkenly grabbing the wheel of the car as she was driving. He said: 'I feel great . actually. I think that moment was I'd been drinking all day and I was . supposed to go to North Wales with my wife and I'd had enough. Candid: The 60-year-old actor told viewers that he had turned the corner having been booked on the show to talk about his issues . Spotted: Mr Jones, who played drunken Les Battersby between 1997 and 2007, was seen leaving the pub after he filmed a cameo on Celebrity Juice on Wednesday . 'I love my wife, I love my wife . more than anything in the world, still do to this day, and I tried to . kill us both. I just grabbed the steering wheel and [thought], ""If I'm . going, you're coming with me. I love you that much that you're coming . with me"". 'I know it sounds stupid, but at . that moment in time, that's how I felt.' He added: 'My friends rallied round and I suddenly decided, it's got to end - either I've got to end or it's got to end - and ""it"", as it turns out was depression.' Mr Jones' Daybreak appearance followed an interview with Tyneside newspaper the Sunday Sun where he compared himself to troubled footballer Paul Gascoigne, 45, who is currently being treated for alcohol addiction. He said: 'Depression is as common as a cold. The more you do positive things, the better life gets. 'I thought: stop going to the pub, stop feeling sorry for yourself, stop blaming other people and blame yourself.' Mr Jones also gave Gazza advice on how to recover from his latest alcohol-related setback, and said that, like the footballer, he had suffered when fans had offered to buy him a pint. 'The only advice I would give to Gazza is get well,' he said. 'We can beat depression. I have beaten it.' Banned: Bruce Jones was given a three year driving ban in 2010 after he admitted drunkenly grabbing the wheel of a car driven by wife Sandra, pictured right . In 1998 Mr Jones was banned from driving for three years after he admitted being drunk behind the wheel. He also admitted to drink driving in 2010 following the incident in the car with his wife and was spared a prison sentence. It was his drinking that led to Mr Jones being axed from Coronation Street after 10 years on the show when he told fellow pubgoers about upcoming storylines. He has struggled to find acting work since leaving the show and has confesses to having blown his fortune and saddled his family with debt which lead to his £500,000 home in Cheshire being repossessed. Three years ago Mr Jones, who has been to rehab twice, was warned by doctors that more drinking could kill him. In an interview last year he revealed that he had drunk as many as 15 pints a day.

"‘The big man is back in town,’ so Christian Benteke did not say on his first appearance in a match for Aston Villa in six months. Wayne Rooney’s famous utterance at the 2006 World Cup is far removed from words that might fall from the Belgium striker’s lips, even if it feels that way for Paul Lambert. Benteke is a quieter soul, the kind who broke the news to friends and family that he would miss a potentially career-defining tournament in Brazil this summer with telephone calls conducted in calm tones. Christian Benteke (right) has been injured for six months, but made his return the U21 Development league . Benteke (right) started for Villa U21s on September 29, scoring a penalty and playing an hour in the match . It was April 3 when he shaped to shoot during a training session at Villa’s Bodymoor Heath training complex and instead crumpled to the floor in agony, not knowing exactly what had afflicted him. By the time he picked up his mobile he was aware it would be at least half a year before he could contemplate prowling the pitch again. Had he not worked so hard, treating his physiotherapy with Villa’s medical staff so seriously, during his lay-off it could have been longer. But the boots came on in earnest against Bolton Wanderers for Villa’s Under-21s game on Monday afternoon – six months to the day since his last match, a 4-1 defeat at Old Trafford. It was another step on the road to full recovery, which still carries potential for peaks and troughs. He scored a penalty, set up a chance for Jores Okore, and lasted 63 minutes before being substituted. Lambert, enthused about the return of his best player, will contemplate naming him on the bench for the visit of Manchester City on Saturday. If not to play, it will provide Benteke and his teammates with a psychological boost. His presence is such it can lift a performance and he would benefit from a matchday atmosphere. Pictured scoring against Norwich in March, Benteke has been a big miss for Villa since his injury . Benteke impressed against Bolton Under 21s, but fans must be patient until he is back to full fitness . It may still be another month before he is able to complete 90 minutes to full effect and Villa fans must be patient. But the statistics show his importance. Since Benteke signed from Genk in 2012 he has scored 34 goals in 67 appearances. With him, Villa win 30 per cent of games, that figure is 26 per cent without him. Possession, passing accuracy, and crosses per game all increase by fractions too when he plays. But it is his offensive impact in this altered Villa side that should be felt greatest. Successive 3-0 defeats to Arsenal and Chelsea should not cloud the fact this team remains significantly stronger in defence that the one Benteke departed. Villa collected 10 points from their first four Premier Leauge games off the back of just six shots on target and four goals. Benteke will advance those numbers. Benteke scored a penalty, set up a chance for Jores Okore, and lasted 63 minutes before being substituted . The Belgian international was back in training this week at Bodymoor Heath, Aston Villa's training ground . There are 8.7 shots per game when he plays, compared to 6.7 when he doesn’t, and 1.2 goals scored per game, compared to 0.8 when he doesn’t. That is the difference between another season struggling against relegation and a first campaign in four years where the threat of the drop doesn’t feature. Lambert must be thankful this troublesome injury, the same which kept Charles N’Zogbia out for the entirety of last season, has denied Benteke the chance of competitive action for a relatively short time. Even if he does not feature until the trip to Everton on October 18, after the international break, Benteke will have missed just 14 Premier League games for Villa. Being unable to represent Belgium in Brazil will have hurt deeply but it enabled him to join his club on the pre-season tour of Texas in July and focus on recovering during the summer. Mark Leather, head of sport development at Bolton and former head physiotherapist at Liverpool, believes Benteke and Villa deserve credit for the timing of his return but explains how the injury still needs to be closely monitored. Benteke will have been devastated to miss Belgium's World Cup campaign in Brazil over the summer . Benteke was all smiles in the week, as he trained with the first team at Aston Villa's training ground . ‘Achilles tendons are notoriously quite complex to rehabilitate, the outcomes are not consistent as with other injuries,’ says Leather. ‘There are more peaks and troughs in the rehab journey than ligament reconstructions or fractures. ‘The tendon is an extension of three big muscles in calf and is key in the ability to push off and accelerate into air. That puts it under immense strain. ‘It’s a good recovery time, not rushing him back too quickly. Benteke will be raring to go but this is the next stage of what is a very long process. ‘The chance of re-rupturing is very slim. But you only know what will happen with games. For the next month to six weeks there will be a grey area, with the medical team assessing how he is coping.’ Benteke’s left foot felt fine after his match against Leather’s team. Fine will do for Lambert, pleased his big man is back in town. Wolves missed the chance to top the Championship by losing to Huddersfield on Wednesday night. But it remains a fine stat after 10 games for three teams of the Midlands. Nottingham Forest sit second as things stand and Derby fourth. Wolves are now seventh. We have four teams from the region in the Premier League and that number could swell come May. Peter Crouch looked like the fall guy in Mark Hughes’s evolution of Stoke City as focus shifted to pace and quick passing. But the former England player still possesses required quality at 33 to contribute in moves and has shown that a striker of substance is needed to convert style into points. Two goals in two games and his understanding with Victor Moses is promising.","Christian Benteke was injured during an Aston Villa training session on April 3, and has missed 14 Premier League matches .

"Barack Obama's administration has cut the budget nearly in half for preventing domestic bombings, MailOnline can reveal. Under President George W. Bush, the Department of Homeland Security had $20 million allocated for preventing the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) by terrorists working inside the United States. The current White House has cut that funding down to $11 million. That assessment comes from Robert Liscouski, a former Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection, in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15 that killed three Americans and injured at least 173 others. He told MailOnline that the Obama-era DHS is, on the whole, about as well-positioned as it was during the Bush administration to handle the aftermath of the April 15 bombings in Boston, 'but the Obama administration has continued to cut the budget for offices such as the Office for Bombing Prevention from $20 million started under Bush, to $11 million today.' Robert Liscouski was the first Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection, and was responsible for creating the Office of Infrastructure Protection Directorate. That sub-agency's job included protecting U.S. sites from improvised explosives, and it later spun off the Office for Bombing Prevention . President Obama received an updated briefing on the Boston Marathon explosions during an April 16 meeting. OBP was represented by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, at far left . 'Comparatively,' he added, 'the Defense Department's Joint IED Defeat Organization had a budget of $1 billion per year focused on preventing IEDs in the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters.' 'Clearly more money needs to be focused on countering domestic IEDs,' Liscouski concluded. He is now a partner at Edge 360, a security and intelligence consultancy. The Office for Bombing Prevention (OBP) was created in 2003 when the Department of Homeland Security was founded. Its original name was the WMD/Bombing Prevention Unit, and it was part of the department's Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate. The sub-agency was renamed the Office for Bombing Prevention in 2006, according to a 2009 DHS briefing booklet obtained by MailOnline and marked 'FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.' Today the OBP describes its mission as 'enhanc[ing] the Nation’s ability to prevent, protect against, respond to, and mitigate the terrorist use of explosives against critical infrastructure, the private sector, and Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial entities.' Its website says it works to 'coordinate national and intergovernmental bombing prevention efforts' and 'enhance counter-IED capabilities.' In February, President Obama issued a National Policy for Countering Improvised Explosives that now governs OBP. 'We must not become complacent,' he wrote . Patrick Starke, an accomplished security expert, runs the Office for Bombing Prevention. He has managed security operations in the Navy, and was also an explosive ordnance disposal officer . But little is known about what role OBP actually plays in attempting . to prevent bombings at public events that could be considered . target-rich environments . Patrick Starke has headed the office since August 2012. He has lengthy security management experience with a defense contractor, in the Navy, and as an explosive ordnance disposal officer. On February 26 the Obama White House issued a lengthy National Policy . for Countering Improvised Explosive Devices. Obama wrote in an . introduction to that document that 'we have no greater responsibility . than providing for the safety and security for [sic] our citizens, . allies, and partners ... The use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) threatens these interests by killing, injuring, and intimidating . citizens and political leaders around the world.' 'We must not become complacent,' he wrote. The policy document included statements about 'enhancing our focus on protecting American lives' and 'screening, detecting, and protecting our people, facilities, transportation systems, [and] critical infrastructure.' Obama's effort followed President George W. Bush's 2007 Homeland Security Presidential Directive-19, which established a national policy on 'the prevention and detection of, protection against, and response to terrorist use of explosives (and IEDs) in the United States.' President George W. Bush (L) created the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 as part of a broad response to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. Former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge (R) was the cabinet-level agency's first secretary . White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Joshua Earnest didn't respond to a question about whether there were any failures in the president's National Policy for Countering Improvised Explosive Devices, or whether it was too soon to judge the February 2013 policy's effectiveness. He referred MailOnline's questions about the president's February policy statement to DHS, where public affairs officer Brian Hyer didn't immediately provide answers to questions. Earnest also didn't respond to a question about how much money Obama's current budget proposal, delivered to Congress on April 10, allocates for domestic prevention of terrorist bombing attacks on American soil. But the February White House policy document acknowledged that 'the threat from IED use is likely to remain high in the coming decade and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them.' 'A whole-of-government approach ... will best position the United States to discover plots to use IEDs in the United States, or against U.S. persons abroad, before those threats become imminent. The Boston-area Joint Terrorism Task Force did not respond to questions about whether an OBP representative was an active member. Homeland Secretary Janet Napolitano is responsible for overseeing the federal government's efforts to prevent bombings like the ones that claimed three lives on April 15. Her press office did not answer questions about why the agency had cut funding for preventing improvised explosive devices .","$20 million budget under Bush became $11 million under Obama .
Both administrations neglected domestic bombing prevention, devoting a tiny fraction of the $1 billion earmarked for IED prevention overseas .

"Friends of an Australian man believed to be fighting with terror group Islamic State have paid tribute to Zia Abdul-Haq who they say has been killed on the battlefield. Abdul-Haq - who is also known as Abu Yusseph - lived in Logan, south of Brisbane in Queensland, before he travelled to Syria in August to fight alongside other IS militants, leaving behind his former wife and child. The man was prolific on social media - including Twitter - and his account was filled with content that made light of the terror group's sinister reputation. Scroll down for video . A fellow militant who is thought to have fought alongside Zia Abdul-Haq has confirmed the Logan man is dead . The Australian is thought to have made his way to Syria in August. Friends back home say he was looking for a new wife . A fellow militant who is thought to have fought alongside Abdul-Haq confirmed his death on October 3, but friends did not learn of his death until Monday. He paid tribute to the Australian by uploading a photo of Abdul-Haq sitting with his legs crossed in front of him looking at his mobile phone, and then went on to say he had seen his body. On a Twitter account linked to Wisam Haddad - the man behind the controversial Al-Risalah Islamic Centre in Sydney which closed its doors last month - tributes starting flowing for Abdul-Haq, The Australian reported. Calling him a 'shaheed', Dr Haddad described his friend as a 'beautiful brother' who was 'always smiling'. 'Shaheed' means 'martyr' in Arabic. Wisam Haddad - the man behind the controversial Al-Risalah Islamic Centre in Sydney which closed its doors last month - paid tribute to Abdul-Haq with this post . Dr Haddad also asked 'Allah to accept him' and wrote 'Allahu Akbar' in capitals, which means 'God is the greatest'. Later he posted a meme-style photo of Abdul-Haq with a weapon behind him superimposed on a blue background with the words: 'Abu Yosouf Al Khura­sani May Allah Accept Him (Martyred on the day of Arafah).' The Day of Arafah is a holy day in the Islamic faith and is part of the yearly pilgrimage to Mecca. These words were accompanied by a translated passage from the Qur'an, which read: 'And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead. Rather, they are alive with their lord (sic), receiving provision'. Abdul-Haq has been described as a 'beautiful brother' who was 'always smiling' Other Twitter users also paid tribute to the Logan man who fled to Syria in August . Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Australian Federal Police for comment on this matter. In the past, Abdul-Zaq has used his Twitter account to showcase what life was like fighting for IS in the Middle East. He posted a series of videos on YouTube with titles such as 'funny terrorist video part 1' - as well as Twitter images of militants cuddling cats, playing video games and training with assault weaponry. The Logan man - who friends back home say he travelled to Syria to find a wife - has also tweeted that he was 'proud to be part of #IslamicState' and denied claims he was 'brainwashed' by Australian preacher Musa Cerantonio who was arrested in the Philippines and then deported back to Australian in July. A couple of weeks later following Cerantonio's deportation, Abdul-Haq posted an image of fighters in the Middle East watching a video of the preacher. 'Mujahideen (warriors) in Ash-Shaam watching Musa Cerantonio's talks #IS #ISIS #jihadist #caliphate #Khilafah,' Abdul-Haq wrote.","Zia Abdul-Haq - also known as Abu Yusseph - died in Syria on October 3 .

"The BBC was accused yesterday of keeping the growing paedophilia scandal from the airwaves in order to protect the Labour Party. Until yesterday afternoon, the corporation had refused to report that three Labour figures had leading positions in a human rights group that backed the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange. The story has been on the Mail’s front page three times but the BBC cut all reference to it from its press reviews yesterday. The BBC was accused yesterday of keeping the growing paedophilia scandal from the airwaves in order to protect the Labour Party . Philip Davies, a Tory MP on the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said the reason for the BBC’s continued silence was institutional left-wing bias. ‘It is a scandal that the Daily Mail is one of the most read papers in the country but is ignored by the national broadcaster,’ he said. ‘The BBC is interested only in stories that favour the Labour party or that appear in the Guardian. If this were about Conservative MPs the Labour party would be up in arms and the story would have been leading Newsnight five days running.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘BBC News is an impartial, independent news organisation and decides its editorial priorities based on merit alone and without external help.’ Philip Davies, a Tory MP on the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said the reason for the BBC¿s continued silence was institutional left-wing bias . Yesterday Sky News journalist Jon Craig confronted Labour leader Ed Miliband about the affair and reported on the story during the channel’s evening bulletin. Adding to the mounting confusion, its own journalists have provided contradictory excuses for why the story has been ignored. While some claimed they were given ‘legal advice’ to drop it, an official spokesman insisted news bosses simply decided the story was ‘not new’. Since it published the results of its PIE investigation last Wednesday, the Daily Mail has run a series of articles – including two further front page splashes - calling for the Labour trio to answer key questions about their time at the National Council For Civil Liberties (NCCL) in the 1970s. But yesterday’s front page story was still ignored by the BBC in its daily newspaper round ups on TV and radio. Late on Sunday night, the BBC News Channel was the first to preview the next day’s front pages. It found time to discuss the front pages of the The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, The Times, The Independent, The Daily Express and The Sun, but made no mention of the Mail’s main story. On Radio 4, the Today programme yesterday summarised a string of articles – from the situation in Ukraine to the news Piers Morgan has quit his CNN talk show – in its two newspaper reviews at 6.38am and 7.35am. Once again, there was no mention of the PIE. Radio Five Live also omitted the Daily Mail story from its 5.15am newspaper summary, and an online article about the day’s front pages made no mention of the PIE story. The striking gap in the BBC’s coverage was not missed by its viewers and listeners, many of whom took to Twitter to voice their frustration that the story had not been given airtime. But the corporation gave conflicting justifications for the continued omission. Last Wednesday, Five Live broadcaster Nicky Campbell blamed ‘legal advice’ for his failure to mention the Mail’s original splash in his newspaper review, saying there was a ‘lack of sources’ and adding it ‘would have been one to go big on if we could stand up.’ But when MailOnline published copies of all the key documents in the investigation later the same day, the BBC quickly changed its stance. Yesterday Sky News journalist Jon Craig confronted Labour leader Ed Miliband about the affair and reported on the story during the channel's evening bulletin . An official spokesman claimed the affair was in fact being ignored for editorial reasons, adding: ‘The story in question is not new, and instead, we have followed several big, breaking news story.’ The BBC’s first mention of the story was in an online article yesterday afternoon that repeated Miss Harman’s allegation she was the victim of a ‘politically motivated smear campaign.’ Its reticence was in marked contrast to its commercial rival Sky News. The channel aired a lengthy discussion about yesterday’s Daily Mail front page on its Sunday night press preview programme. Presenter Eamonn Holmes again mentioned the story in his round-up of the day’s papers in his early morning show Sunrise. And yesterday afternoon Sky journalist Jon Craig confronted Labour leader Ed Miliband about the affair and reported on the affair during the evening news bulletin.","Failed to report Labour figures 'link' with Paedophile Information Exchange .

"Danny Welbeck’s impressive start to his Arsenal career can largely be attributed to the players and backroom staff assembled at the Emirates, according to Calum Chambers. Chambers, who also arrived at the Gunners this summer following a £12million move from Southampton, has praised the welcoming nature of the squad and staff at the north London club. ‘He has settled in really well,’ said Chambers of his team-mate, after the former Manchester United striker scored a hat-trick in Arsenal’s 4-1 win over Galatasaray at the Emirates on Wednesday night. Danny Welbeck scored a hat-trick in Arsenal's Champions League clash against Galatasaray on Wednesday . Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain pose with the match ball after the striker scored his first career treble . Alexis Sanchez was seen sporting an ice pack on his ankle in the second half after he was substituted . Chambers added: ‘When I first came, I said the bunch of lads here and the staff are so welcoming to a new person that it is hard not to settle in quickly to be honest.' Welbeck's treble takes him to four goals in five appearances for the Gunners and also marked the first professional hat-trick of his career. ‘He is an athlete with pace and power on the ball and he is willing to work hard,' said Chambers. 'He is a goalscorer, so he is everything you could ask for. He is a great influence for the team.’ Calum Chambers has enjoyed a strong start to his career at Arsenal following his move from Southampton . Alexis Sanchez, Arsenal’s £30million arrival from Barcelona, has also impressed since signing from the Nou Camp. Sanchez scored Arsenal’s third goal on the night with a well-taken finish shortly before the interval. But the Chile international was later substituted and was seen nursing a knock to his ankle with an ice pack ahead of Sunday’s London derby against Chelsea. Ahead of the clash at Stamford Bridge, Chambers said: 'We will go into it with high hopes and we are on a good run. 'We had a good result tonight and we will give it our best shot. It will be a tough game, but we will go into it 100 per cent focused and look for a result.'","Former Manchester United striker scored a hat-trick against Galatasaray .

"A woman who thought she had a pain in her side died just four days after doctors told her she had ovarian cancer. Previously fit and healthy, customer services adviser Rachelle Beckett first felt the pain while she was on holiday in Rhodes with her partner Stephen Sinclair in May. The 43-year-old was treating it with Paracetamol on returning to the UK then went to see her GP who sent her to hospital for checks. Just five days later she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer which doctors found had spread to her liver, lungs and stomach. Rachelle Beckett, pictured, first felt a pain in her side while she was on holiday in Rhodes with her partner Stephen Sinclair . She was not well enough to undergo chemotherapy and Miss Beckett, from Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire died at Barnsley Hospital four days afterwards on June 27. Dr Patricia Foster, director of clinical director of oncology at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said ovarian cancer symptoms can be difficult to recognise. She said: 'There are early symptoms to look out for such as persistent bloating, pain in the pelvis and lower stomach and difficulty eating. 'It is most common in women who have had the menopause but it can affect women of any age.' Her mother Lesley Olsson and her stepfather Kris praised their daughter's bravery. Mrs Olsson said: 'Rachelle was a very private person and kept her pain to herself. I don't think anyone realised it was as bad as it was. 'She had time off work and was taking Paracetamol for the pain in her side. We kept asking the nurses at hospital what if we'd come sooner but they said her symptoms were not severe enough to point to what it was. 'She was so incredibly brave. She never cried or asked ""why me?"" she was just resigned to it. 'The day before she died I was alone with her in her room and she had the most wonderful smile on her face. She said: ""It's quite exciting. I'm going on an adventure."" That's what her attitude was like.' Rachelle Beckett was not well enough to undergo chemotherapy and she died at Barnsley Hospital, pictured, four days after being told she had ovarian cancer. The care she received was 'second to none' Ovarian cancer affects more than 6,500 women in the UK each year. It is the fifth most common cancer among women. It is most common in women who have had the menopause but it can affect women of any age. The symptoms are difficult to recognise, especially in the early stages of the disease, as they can be very similar to those of other, less serious, conditions. The most common early symptoms are persistent bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating and nausea. Other symptoms can include back pain and needing to pass urine more frequently. Source: NHS Choices . Mrs Olsson . said the care her daughter received at hospital was 'second to none' and they are now raising money for Cancer Research UK. Miss Beckett worked for a car firm and she holidayed in Greece twice a year and was interested in cooking and socialising. She loved the band Pulp and their hit 'Common People' was the first song to be played at her funeral. She always wore red lipstick and all the women who went to her funeral wore the lipstick in her memory. Her mother said: 'She was the victim of a nasty, insidious disease which spread through her body rapidly and took her life on the day she was going to be transferred to a local hospice. 'We are left trying to make some sort of sense of what has happened and searching for the reasons why? 'She had her life before her, things to do and places to see. She was only 43 and was taken from us in just nine days. 'We feel cheated but also privileged to have had her in our lives. She endured her illness with an inner strength which we found humbling.'","Rachelle Beckett first felt pain while she was on holiday in Rhodes, Greece .

"Marussia have confirmed they will run only one car at the Russian Grand Prix 'out of respect' to Jules Bianchi. The Frenchman remains in a stable but critical condition in Mie University Hospital following his horror crash last Sunday.

The second Marussia car will sit in the team's garage for the duration of the Grand Prix weekend . Max Chilton (centre) admitted he is 'truly devastated' after the crash that left his team-mate in hospital . Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone confirmed Marussia would not be sanctioned or penalised for only running one car. A team statement read: 'The Marussia F1 Team will run a single car for the duration of the forthcoming grand prix weekend in Sochi out of respect for their driver Jules Bianchi, who remains in hospital in Yokkaichi, Japan, in a critical but stable condition. 'The team have written to the stewards of the meeting to inform them they have withdrawn their second car. 'Notwithstanding the presence in Sochi of Alexander Rossi, the nominated official reserve driver for the 2014 Russian Grand Prix, the team feels strongly that fielding a single car, that of driver No 4, Max Chilton, is the appropriate course of action under the difficult circumstances of the weekend. 'Jules' car crew have built a second car, which has been scrutineered and is ready to race, and this will remain on his side of the garage throughout the weekend.

Bianchi underwent emergency brain surgery on Sunday evening after his crash. The 25-year-old Frenchman smashed into a recovery vehicle at Suzuka that was removing the wrecked Sauber of Adrian Sutil after the German hurtled off track into a tyre barrier. Bianchi has been diagnosed with a diffuse axonal injury to the brain whereby damage is widespread rather than localised in one particular area.

"The sales tax on cookies, chips, sodas and other junk food sold on the country's largest American Indian reservation is going up. Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly signed legislation on Friday to increase by 2 per cent the sales tax on food with little to no nutritional value, starting next year. No other sales tax on the Navajo Nation specifically targets the spending habits of consumers. It will remain in effect until 2020, but it can be extended by the Navajo Nation Council. A Navajo family outside their traditional dwelling called a hogan on a Navajo reservation - thousands of people live without electricity and have no way of storing perishable food items for too long . Navajos advocating for a junk-food tax said they wanted to pass a bill that could serve as a model for Indian Country to improve the rates of diabetes and obesity among tribal members. Proposals targeting sugary drinks with proposed bans, size limits, tax hikes and warning labels haven't gained widespread traction across the country. 'We want them to think twice about buying healthy foods instead of soda pop, potato chips and the junk food,' said Gloria Begay of the Dine Community Advocacy Alliance. 'The effort is really much more in the message of Navajo people making better choices for quality foods.' The bill cited statistics from the Navajo-area Indian Health Service that said about one-third of Navajos are diabetic or pre-diabetic, and the obesity rate for some age groups is as high as 60 percent. Diabetes was the fourth-leading cause of death in the Navajo area from 2003 to 2005, the health service said. The $1 million-a-year that the additional tax is expected to generate will pay for projects including farmer's markets, vegetable gardens and wellness and exercise equipment in the tribe's 110 communities. Begay said her group is meeting with tribal officials to figure out exactly how the money will be disbursed. The Navajo Nation (pictured) is putting a tax on junk food to try to cut obesity rates on the reservation . Another bill to eliminate the tribe's 5 percent sales tax on fresh fruit and vegetables sold on the Navajo Nation went into effect October 1. Shelly vetoed another version of the junk food tax earlier this year. His spokesman, Deswood Tome, said Friday that the latest version is clearer on how it will be implemented. Representatives of the beverage industry had lobbied the tribe to reject the tax, saying it would create problems for retailers and doesn't solve health problems. It also applies to sports drinks, fruit juice and pita chips. The tax won't add significantly to the price of junk food, but buying food on the reservation presents obstacles that don't exist in most of urban America. The reservation is a vast 27,000 square miles with few grocery stores and a population with an unemployment rate of around 50 percent. Thousands of people live without electricity and have no way of storing perishable food items for too long.","Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly signed legislation to increase by 2 per cent the sales tax on food with little to no nutritional value next year .

"Liverpool will consider a January move for West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino. The England Under 21 international starlet has been targeted by Tottenham Hotspur and there has been a £15million offer mooted by the north London club. That falls ways short of the price which would persuade West Brom to sell. West Brom and England Under 21 striker Saido Berahino has 11 goals for club and country this season . Berahino slots home West Brom's equaliser in the last minute in the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace . Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool are after Berahino but West Brom will want at least £25million for him . The Baggies believe Berahino is worth in excess of £25m, and Liverpool’s potential interest could see a bidding battle with Spurs. It is already recognised in Liverpool circles that the signing of Mario Balotelli is a gamble which has not worked. But the Reds will find it hard to 'move on' Balotelli in the January transfer window. Even if they can’t, the club are set to move for a new striker, with Behahino now high on the list.

They surrendered a two-goal lead which leaves their hopes of progressing hanging by a thread. Wed: Arsenal display great spirit by winning their Champions League game against Anderlecht that had seemed lost until the last few minutes. It could be a sign that the Gunners have that bit extra to go along in Europe this season given the Premier League title already seems beyond them. Thurs: Tottenham’s Erik Lamela comes good at last with a wonder goal in the Europa League. But it still remains to be seen whether he produces such magic in the Premier League (see Libero) Fri: Ahead of 'El Clasico', Luis Suarez snaps after being asked about the incident which caused his ban then storms out of a press conference. Why is Suarez so, er, bitter? Tony Pulis is being lined up as Harry Redknapp’s successor at Queens Park Rangers. The word on the grapevine is that Redknapp may only have two games to save his job. That process starts on Monday night at Loftus Road when QPR take on Aston Villa. They face Chelsea next weekend, too. It has been perceived that if Redknapp is ousted then Glenn Hoddle, whom he brought in as coach, would take over. Indeed that was one plan. Hoddle could well be asked to hold the fort in the short term should Redknapp go and the emergency engagement could evolve. Tim Sherwood would also come in to the equation as a successor given his close relationship with Les Ferdinand, who is now Head of Football Operations at the club. But Football Grapevine sources say club owner Tony Fernandes may well see Pulis as the best man to lead Rangers to safety just as he did at Crystal Palace last season. ...................................................................

Sportsmail had previously reported that Carlo Ancelotti will attempt to block any move to buy Khedira this January, but Real Madrid will overrule their coach if the offer comes close to their £10million valuation of the player whose contract runs out at the end of the season.

Although Sam Allardyce has turned the team and his fortunes around at West Ham thus far - not least in the eyes of co-owner David Sullivan - the club will not be rushing into talks over a new contract. Allardyce’s current reputed £2.7million-a-year deal expires next summer. Russell Brand (right) kisses West Ham United boss Sam Allardyce after their victory over Manchester City . By the way... Opinion seems divided as to whether Mario Balotelli was wrong to swap shirts at half-time when Liverpool were getting their shirts stuffed by Real Madrid last week. For what it is worth I think he was wrong, showing no respect for his team mates, the fans, the badge and indeed the idea of competitive sport where the shirt is a symbol of the team ethic. It seems to me the time has come for the football authorities to act on this issue so there is no debate. If a player can be shown a yellow card for ripping off his shirt as part of a goal celebration, then swapping shirts at any point during a match should be a red card offence.

Following Manchester City’s defeat at West Ham, Chelsea can forge ahead in the title race at Old Trafford on Sunday. That is why Jose Mourinho may now instruct his team to go for the kill and win, rather than seek a draw. A Chelsea win is 6/4. I fancy Coral's offer of 12/1 for a 2-0 Blues win.

Tottenham’s Erik Lamela caused a bit of a stir last week with a bit of maverick magic in scoring a 'wonder goal' for Tottenham in their Europa Cup win over Astreas Trioplis. It’s easy to see why many fans got so excited but it did seem some top professionals went over the top in their praise. Indeed one ex-pro striker I know, while admiring the technique, questioned whether Lamela would have been able to pull off that bit of showboating against anything other than low grade opposition. 'If it had been 0-0 in a cup final and one chance come along would he do it then? Can you imagine if you got it wrong, fell over and the chance went and the game was lost?,' my pal asked. Harsh? A bit of jealousy even? Maybe. Erik Lamela's astonishing rabona strike put Tottenham Hotspur in control against Asteras Tripolis . Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino gives Lamela a pat on the back after his goalscoring exploits . Anyway, as we all know now the technical term for a reverse scissor kick is actually a 'rabona'. And here is the definition: . A method of kicking the football with the kicking leg wrapped around the back of the standing leg, so it appears the player has their legs crossed. The first reported rabona happened in a league game in Argentina in 1948 and was performed by Ricardo Infante. Soon after, a magazine front cover featured Infante dressed as a pupil with the caption 'Infante played hooky'; rabona means to skip school in Spanish. Diego Maradona, Roberto Baggio, Gianfranco Zola and Paul Gascoigne are among the players who have performed a successful rabona during a game. England legend Paul Gascoigne performs the rabona in 1991 as he dons the Three Lions jersey . Back Heel . There are those who argue that had George Best signed for Chelsea in the early Seventies his career would have been re-booted and the success the Blues had winning the FA Cup then European Cup Winners Cup with swagger would have been sustained. As it was Chelsea, like 'Bestie', lost their way. That said, Best did appear for Chelsea in Peter Osgood’s testimonial in 1975. And his two goals in that game prompted then-Blues manager Eddie McCreadie to try and sign Best, who at the time was playing for Fourth Division Stockport 'on licence' from United. Peter Osgood (centre) at his testimonial match with George Best  (left) and Alan Hudson (right) in 1975 . Stockport were paying Best, who was just 29, £300 a week, which was more than the weekly wages of most players in the then First Division. When Chelsea approached Best he asked for £1,000 a week - a staggering sum back in the day. Blues chairman Brian Mears refused. A year later Best would sign for Fulham and for a season or so his career alongside Rodney Marsh enjoyed a revival before he ended up show-boating in the United States. One can only imagine though what it would have been like on and off the pitch had Best teamed up with Osgood and Alan Hudson sooner.
