Calmly strolling through a busy Tube station, the man in the leather jacket could be on his way home from work, or heading out for a drink with friends. In fact, police believe he is on a mission to murder. He is the main suspect in a hunt for the gunman who blasted a Russian banker six times outside his luxury flat. German Gorbuntsov, 46, was sprayed with bullets outside his Docklands apartment by a hooded hitman in a botched assassination which left him disabled. Scroll down to see the CCTV . Wanted: The man. pictured facing the camera in a black leather jacket and blue jeans is shown on a platform at Canary Wharf tube station moments after the shooting . Scotland Yard revealed yesterday that . they were pursuing significant new leads after releasing footage of the . suspect in the shooting. CCTV images show the man casually . dressed, wearing a black jacket with its  collar pulled up and blue . jeans, coolly  walking through Canary Wharf station and mingling with . dozens of commuters on their way home on a Tuesday evening. Just moments earlier, Mr Gorbuntsov, . an exiled financier who was in hiding in London, was gunned down on his . doorstep after stepping out of a taxi which dropped him off at his . exclusive apartment block at 7.20pm on March 20. The 46-year-old was shot six times . with a specially modified 9mm Russian semi-automatic pistol rarely seen . in Britain, which has been described by weapons experts as a . ‘professional assassin’s weapon’. The victim collapsed to the ground, blood pouring from his chest and stomach as his hooded attacker fled on foot. His mistress, Natasha Semchenkova, 36, . was seen crying hysterically and making phone calls as paramedics . battled to save Mr Gorbuntsov’s life. Astonishingly, he survived the attack because all the bullets missed vital organs. Suspects: As part of a Crimewatch appeal police . want to track down these two men, left and right, seen here on the night . of the shooting . Going out: The man, with a bag, makes his way out of Canary Wharf tube station moments before shooting . Yesterday the businessman, who is . still recovering under armed guard in hospital amid fears of another . attempt on his life, told how he came face to face with his would-be . killer. He told BBC Crimewatch: ‘The worst feeling is that guy shot me and ran away and probably very much hoped he had killed me. ‘This incident has changed my whole life.’ Mr Gorbuntsov added: ‘They found six . bullets inside me. I was badly injured and badly affected. I have . serious internal damage to my body and I still haven’t seen a single . doctor who is absolutely convinced it will be fine. ‘I will make it but I will be disabled. My future is uncertain.’ Victim: Lying surrounded by machines and cables German Gorbuntsov, is shown in his London hospital bed . Scotland Yard released CCTV images of . the suspect, described as white, 6ft tall and slim, fleeing the flats on . Byng Street wearing a dark hooded top. He is thought to have run towards the Marsh Wall area where he dumped the weapon and his blood-spattered clothing. Police found a hooded top in the . bushes nearby, along with the 9mm Makarov pistol complete with a . specially adapted silencer and a black fake leather bag that the man had . been seen carrying on CCTV moments earlier as he exited Canary Wharf . station at 7.08pm. Just after 7.30pm, the same man was seen entering the . station, this time wearing a leather jacket, but with no bag. Evidence: This Soviet military Makarov 9mm pistol was found dumped after the attack in March . Officers have also released CCTV . images thought to be of the same man wearing a hooded top in the area . the day before the shooting. Detective Chief Inspector Russell Taylor, . who is leading the hunt for the assassin, said: ‘The gun, a 9mm Makarov . pistol, is highly unusual and is rarely used in Britain.’ Yesterday a spokesman for Scotland . Yard said they had already received several calls following the . Crimewatch appeal on Thursday night. He added: ‘We are working on those . names now, to see if we can find anything out.’ He revealed that police already have a . full DNA profile of the attacker and they also have Russian-speaking . officers to assist the inquiry.

Detectives are liaising with their . counterparts in Moscow for the first time since Alexander Litvinenko, a . former KGB agent, was poisoned with polonium-210 in a London hotel in . 2006. Mr Gorbuntsov made a fortune in . banking and construction post-Communist Russia, but he also acquired . enemies and fled Moscow in 2010. There are several theories surrounding . the attack, including a Russian police investigation into the shooting . of Mr Gorbuntsov’s business partner, tens of millions missing from . Russia’s state railway, armed Chechen gangs and allegations of . embezzlement and the illegal takeover of a bank in neighbouring Moldova. Happy couple: German Gorbuntsov is shown with his wife Larisa Gorbuntsova on a trip to Prague in the Czech republic . Gun blast: German Gorbuntsov is pictured here being carried into ambulance after being shot in Canary Wharf . The victim believes the assassination . attempt is directly linked to his intention to provide evidence against . former associates over the 2009 shooting of a financier in  Moscow and . the alleged embezzlement of billions of roubles from Russia’s state . railways. Mr Gorbuntsov is seeking asylum in Britain for both his ‘wives’ and their children. He believes it is too dangerous for his wife Larisa, 46, and their son Vladislav, 26, to return to Moscow. He is also seeking political asylum . for his long-time Russian girlfriend, with whom he was living when he . was shot, and their two-year-old son.","German Gorbunstov was shot six times and is lucky to be alive after the attack in March .

A hero war veteran was left in agony with a broken back after being kept waiting for almost 20 hours in A&E, his daughter claims. Yvonne Ingley says that despite her father Bill Smith screaming in pain, staff at Burton's Queen's Hospital gave the 87-year-old no treatment at all for three hours. The father-of-eight, who served as a paratrooper during the Second World War, had suffered a fractured vertebrae in a fall at his home in Staffordshire on July 10th. Bill Smith, pictured, an 87-year-old war veteran, was forced to wait almost 20 hours in A&E according to his daughter . He was discovered by his 63-year-old daughter who has slammed the hospital's treatment of her father. She said: 'My dad was in agony, he was screaming out in pain. We got to hospital at about 1.30am and he was given no pain relief until about 4am. A photograph showing Bill Smith in his army uniform. Bill fought at the Battle of Monte Cassino in World War II as a paratrooper . 'My dad had a broken back, usually the older generation don't like to fuss about pain and he is a former paratrooper, but he was genuinely in agony. 'During all this time my father was left in the A&E waiting area, they decided to send him to the Hillfield Care Home in Stretton but he was not taken there until about 7pm. 'The care home said it could not take him because of his fractured spine. 'My dad then had to be taken back to hospital and re-admitted.' The 63-year-old added that despite the long wait in A&E, she did not blame medical staff at the Burton Hospital for her father's treatment. She said: 'I had no complaint with the doctors and nurses but it's obvious someone somewhere is not organising things properly.' The elderly war veteran waited until 11am - nine-and-a-half hours after being admitted - to be assessed by a physiotherapist. And finally, almost twelve hours later, she was told her father would be taken to a care home in Stretton, Staffordshire to recover. The ordeal was not over there, however, as the 87-year-old was taken back to the hospital after a transport mix-up. Bill Smith's daughter claims that the 87-year-old pensioner was left waiting in agony in A&E at the Burton Hospital after suffering a broken back in a fall at his home . An ambulance carrying her dad arrived at the care home only to be told they couldn't take him because he wasn't mobile. She said when she heard her dad had gone back to hospital she rushed down there only to discover he had been put to the back of the waiting list.

His daughter claims that the pensioner suffered greatly because of his lengthy wait. Ms Ingley also believes that as well as the wait he endured in the A&E department he could have been laying undiscovered for at least an hour before she called round to his house to check on him. She said: 'He was distressed because he was in pain and my sisters and I were distressed to see him in that state.' Helen Ashley, Chief Executive of Burton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We are aware of the concerns of Mr Smith’s family and we can confirm that Mr Smith did attend the Trust’s A & E Department.

Teacher Lizzie Griffiths, 25, is so smitten with her adopted bearded dragon George that she has spent her complete £3,000 wedding fund on pioneering cancer treatment for him, without which he would have had to have been put down. Lizzie lost her heart to George when she spotted him at a rescue centre last year. But after a few months she was devastated to find he had a tumour growing on his face. Devoted: Lizzie Griffiths has spent her £3,000 savings on cancer treatment for her pet lizard George . She paid for it to be removed twice, but it kept growing back. Now she has spent her £3,000 savings on a new treatment – chemotherapy for lizards. George is thought to be the first bearded dragon in the UK to have radiotherapy. Lizzie has been travelling 100 miles from her home in Purley, Surrey, so that George could have regular treatment at the Animal Health Trust in Newmarket, Suffolk. She has now been told that the cancer is in remission and George is likely to make a full recovery. Bearded lizards usually live for up to 15 years.

'When I first held him, he burrowed into my neck and it was like he was saying he had found his new home,’ she said of the lizard. 'Now I wake up at half five in the morning just so we can have a cuddle because, if I don't get much time with him, it upsets me.' She said during his treatment she worried about George as if he were a sick child. 'You would do anything to make a sick child better and it is like he is my child,' she said.

Unexpected arrival: Gemma with her partner David Phillips and their surprise son Alexander . A woman who was told her aches and pains were due to injuries from a car crash was astonished when she gave birth to a baby. Gemma Cleghorn, 25, said she had no idea she was pregnant until she was rushed to hospital with suspected internal bleeding five months after a motorway prang – only to be told she was actually in labour. The former NVQ assessor visited doctors six times after the accident, complaining of a bad back and swollen stomach. However, each time the medics put her symptoms down to the bump she had on a slip-road. Now weeks after giving birth Gemma still can’t believe she’s a mother. She said: 'Every time I went to see my GP they put my symptoms down the crash. Even when my periods stopped they said it had been caused by the stress and trauma of the crash. 'I was terrified I would die of internal bleeding when I was rushed to hospital so at first I was relieved when they said I was actually pregnant. Then they said I was in labour and it hit me that I was about to give birth to a baby. 'I went into shock again. My partner just went white. We couldn’t believe it was happening, especially given the amount of time I’d spent in the GPs surgery.' Her partner, Dave, 25, said: 'Earlier that night Gemma had posted a status on Facebook complaining of a stomach ache. I had to go and tell everybody why. At first they didn’t believe me at first.' Hours later their son was born and they called the 7lb 3oz baby boy Alexander. Gemma said: 'It's a miracle he survived the accident and then went unnoticed by all those doctors so many times. I was worried about all the drugs I had taken. But he’s perfect and I love being a mum. 'I always wanted a baby one day but I never thought it would happen like this.' Gemma, from Sunderland, was on her way to work in January this year when she tried to get on the motorway but with no gaps in the traffic came to a halt on the slip road. Her vehicle was struck from behind by another car at 70 miles per hour and her car was a write off. She said: 'The police and an ambulance came but it wasn’t until the next day when I woke in agony that I realised I’d even been hurt.' Daddy's boy: David with his son shortly after the birth . Gemma was diagnosed with bruising and whiplash. But despite being prescribed painkillers, as the weeks passed, her injuries seemed to get worse rather than better. She said: 'I went back to work two weeks later. The bruising had started to fade but my back was aching and I couldn’t stand for long.' The damaged car after the accident . Gemma went back to her GP and was prescribed painkillers for discomfort associated with whiplash. But over the next few weeks she visited several more times complaining of more backache and irregular periods. 'They said that was also due to the crash because stress and trauma can stop your cycle. It made sense so I didn’t question it,' she said. Gemma was also putting on weight but put that down to being unable to exercise due to her injuries. 'My weight has always fluctuated and again it made sense because I hadn’t been very active since the crash.' By May this year she’d been back to her GP six times. 'The last time I was so worried about my back ache that I asked for a scan but was told it wasn’t necessary and to keep up with the painkillers. 'I’d been living on Tramadol since the crash and it was starting to get me down. I just wanted to feel better again.' Nice to meet you: Gemma went to the doctors six times but her pregnancy wasn't noticed . Then on 23rd May this year Gemma, who had started a new job as nursery nurse, got a stomach ache at work. Soon after what she thought was her period started. 'I was pleased it was a sign of things getting back to normal,' she said. But back at home the cramps got worse and at 3am her worried student boyfriend called an ambulance. 'I told them about the crash and the pain I had been in ever since. Their immediate concern was internal bleeding. I was terrified. I thought I might die the pain was that bad.' She was rushed to hospital where an A&E doctor examined her stomach and ordered scan that revealed she was in fact pregnant. 'It was like it was happening to someone else. Things like that don’t happen in real life.' But before the astonished couple had time for the news to sink in, doctors dropped the bombshell that not only was Gemma pregnant – but she was full term and needed to push. 'I looked at Dave and could see he was struggling to take it in too. I told him to call my mum and they wheeled me straight to the maternity ward to give birth.’ Their son was born two hours later at 6.23 am that morning. David, pictured with Gemma before her pregnancy, said friends and family didn't believe them at first after they announced the birth of their son . Gemma with her son Alexander. Doctors told her that an earlier car crash was responsible for her pregnancy pains . She said: 'When I held him I kept thinking it was a dream. How could this baby be mine? 'Thank God after all he'd been through he was perfect and we can’t believe how lucky we are to have him. 'And as soon as I gave birth all the crash ‘symptoms’ stopped straight away. 'I think if they had examined me more thouroughly they would have found out I was pregnant and I would have worked it out had they not kept telling me everything was due to the crash.' She added: 'I was on the pill. The last thing in the world I expected was a baby. 'But I’m just lucky that were both well and so proud to be a mummy.’","Medics said Gemma Cleghorn's periods had stopped because of the trauma from crash .

But that's not Kate's style. She scored a thriftiness hat trick yesterday, wearing the same jaunty headpiece for the third time in little over a year. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were in Edinburgh, where William was installed into the highest order of chivalry north of the border. Kate, known in Scotland as the Countess of Strathearn, attends a Thistle . Service at St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh for the installation of The . Prince William, Earl of Strathearn, as a Knight of the Thistle . The Duchess attends Investec Derby Day at the Investec Derby Festival at Epsom Downs Racecourse in June 2011 (left) and (right) attending the wedding of Emily McCorquodale and James Hutt in June 2012 . The colour of the Emilia Wickstead coat-dress, which was created especially for Kate ahead of the event, was an unusual choice for the duchess, who has only worn yellow in public once before . Elegant: Kate has shown a fondness for the New Zealand-born, British-based designer of late, and wore a pink Wickstead coat-dress twice in recent months . It was the couple's first official engagement as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn, the titles they use in Scotland. In a typically thoughtful gesture, . Kate carried with her a wrap made out of the clan's distinctive tartan. And she also displayed her trademark thrift in the £99 latte-coloured . sisal cocktail hat, by Luton-based milliner Whiteley. She first wore it at last year's . Derby, and last month paired it with a pale embellished coat for the . wedding of William's cousin, Emily McCorquodale. Yesterday she wore a beautiful pale . gold coat dress by society designer Emilia Wickstead, a favourite of the . Prime Minister's wife, Samantha Cameron. The duchess recently sported a £1,200 . Wickstead coat in pink, but this one, according to the designer, was . made especially for her and would have cost significantly more. Her husband, William, wore the moss green velvet gown and distinctive heron-plumed hat of the Order of the Thistle. Kate's hat is by Luton-based milliner Whiteley, £99, supplied at Fenwick on Bond St, and is a style she has worn on a number of previous occasions . Just as she did on the day of the Jubilee flotilla, Kate carried a folded Strathearn scarf, a nod to her Scottish title . The Duchess of Cambridge last carried the folded Strathearn tartan scarf during the Jubilee flotilla last month, left, and in an identical manner today . The order, founded in 1687, is unique to Scotland. Unlike many national honours, it is in the personal gift of the Queen. She made her grandson a Knight of the Thistle to mark both her Diamond Jubilee and his 30th birthday. It is the . highest honour in Scotland and is second only in precedence in the UK to . the Order of the Garter. At her ears Kate wore a pair of simple gold and citrine drop earrings by jeweller Kiki McDonough . The order honours men and women who have held public office or who have contributed in a significant way to national life. The Princess Royal was invested in the Order of the Thistle in June 2001. The royal family entered the . cathedral shortly before 11am to a fanfare, accompanied by other members . of the Order, all wearing ceremonial gowns. Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cambridge, took her place in the audience. Kiki McDonough citrine drop earrings, £495, as worn by the Duchess of Cambridge .

The short ceremony took place within the internal Thistle Chapel and was broadcast through speakers to those in the cathedral. The Queen said: 'It is our pleasure . that His Royal Highness the Prince William, Earl of Strathearn, be . installed a Knight of the most ancient and most noble Order of the . Thistle.' The Queen and her husband are members . of the Scottish order of chivalry, as is Princess Anne. Only the . Sovereign has the power to bring new members into the order, and it is . an honour she may choose to bestow herself without seeking approval from . the Government. Kate wore a coat dress by Emilia . Wickstead in delicate primrose yellow - a colour often favoured by the . Queen on joyous occasions. Indeed, the monarch chose yellow on the . occasion of Kate and William's wedding last April.

The Royals dressed in traditional bottle green velvet cloaks and feathered hats for the service at St Giles Cathedral today . The pomp and pageantry of the Order of the Thistle ceremony dates back to the 1600s when it was founded by James VII of Scotland, also James II of England . The Queen said in the services it was her 'pleasure' that His Royal Highness the Prince William, Earl of Strathearn, be installed a Knight of the most ancient and most noble Order of the Thistle . The Order's vestements include a white taffeta-lined green velvet mantle worn over a suit or military uniform and tied with green and gold tassels, with the star of the Order on the left shoulder. The black velvet hat is trimmed with white ostrich feathers and a black egret or heron feather. A gold collar with thistles and rue sprigs is worn over the mantle, and the St Andrew, known as the 'badge-appendant' is attached to the collar . The Queen was accompanied by fellow Order of the Thistle members the Duke of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal and the Duke of Cambridge . The Royals leave the Signet Library to head to St Giles Cathedral ahead of the Thistle ceremony . Noble: The Queen and Prince Philip are also members of the Order of the Thistle, an order of chivalry unique to Scotland . Princess Anne is a member of the Order of the Garter as well as the Order of the Thistle, meaning she holds the highest honour in both Scotland and England . The Royals emerge after the ceremony, which took place within the internal Thistle Chapel and was broadcast through speakers to those in the cathedral . The Queen and Princess Anne removed their gowns after the service to reveal elegant floor-length outfits . The Queen's white gown was made from richly textured silk, and at her neck she wore a diamond and emerald necklace . Noble: The insignia of the ancient Scottish Order of the Thistle . Like the Order of the Garter in England, the Order of the Thistle is a noble order of chivalry, but it is unique to Scotland. The current order was founded in 1687 by King James VII of Scotland, also known as James II of England. The Sovereign grants membership to the order, and need not seek approval from the Government. The Queen, Prince Philip and Princess Anne are Knights of the Thistle. Male Knights of the Thistle may use the title Sir, while ladies can use Lady before their forename. Wives of Knights may use Lady as a prefix to their surname, although peers and princes do not use these titles unless their names are written out in their fullest forms. The motto of the order is Nemo me impune lacessit, which is translated as No one attacks me with impunity,  or alternatively No one can harm me unpunished. The same motto appears on the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom for use in Scotland and some pound coins. The same mottos is also used by the Royal Regiment of Scotland, Scots Guards, The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. The Order's patron saint is St Andrew, and its emblem is a thistle, Scotland's national flower. The Order's vestements include a white taffeta-lined green velvet mantle . worn over a suit or military uniform and tied with green and gold . tassels, with the star of the Order on the left shoulder. The black . velvet hat is trimmed with white ostrich feathers and a black egret or . heron feather. A gold collar with thistles and rue sprigs is worn over . the mantle, and the St Andrew, known as the 'badge-appendant' is . attached to the collar. On the left shoulder of the mantle is a star badge bearing the motto of the Order, Nemo me impune lacessit (no one can harm me unpunished). The velvet hat is trimmed with ostrich feathers and one black egret or heron top feather in the centre . Society favourite: Designer Emilia Wickstead with loyal client Samantha Cameron . British based, New Zealand-born designer Emilia Wickstead has fast become one of the go-to designers for London's high society.In business just three years, Ms Wickstead has already dressed a number of royals - not least Kate, who wore an emerald Emilia Wickstead coat dress for a St Patrick's Day appearance earlier this year, and the same £1,200 pink coat dress on two occasions in the past two months - once for a Jubilee lunch at Windsor Castle, and again just two weeks later for a Buckingham Palace garden party.

Homeowners are facing more misery with the announcement that the Co-operative Bank is the latest provider to push up the cost of its lending, as experts fear more could follow suit. The self-proclaimed 'ethical lender' joins Halifax, Bank of Ireland and Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks in raising its standard variable rate, which will rise to 4.74% in May. The Co-op's move is a further warning . sign that more lenders may push up their monthly payments, despite the . Bank of England maintaining the base rate at a historic 0.5% low. Price hikes: More homeowners are facing misery with the announcement that the Co-operative Bank are the latest provider to push up its cost of lending . Co-operative Bank are the latest bank to follow a round of increases. Lenders to have announced rises in SVRs in recent weeks include: . Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks will . increase their standard variable rates (SVRs) from 4.59% to 4.95% from . May 1, affecting 30,000 customers. RBS-NatWest said it is pushing up . rates on two of its products - the Offset and the One Account - by . 0.25%, taking them to a rate of 4%, affecting around 200,000 customers. Halifax announced that some 850,000 . borrowers will see their mortgage costs increase as the SVR rises from . 3.5% to 3.99% from May 1. The Bank of Ireland also . announced that it is increasing its SVR, affecting 100,000 UK customers. It will raise the SVR on its mortgages to 4.49% from 2.99% in two . stages. What does Standard variable rates mean? Standard variable rates are the generic . term for what borrowers typically revert to when a fix or tracker deal . period runs out and the vast majority have no lock to base rate, so can . move independently of Bank of England changes. James Cotton from London & Country . Mortgages said 'I’d be very surprised if we don’t see other lenders . following the lead set by these banks. 'It was a case of all quiet on . the Western Front for a long time but now we’ve had four lenders . announce a hike in their SVR in as many weeks - five if you include . Royal Bank of Scotland/Natwest increasing the rates on its offset and . One Account mortgages,' he added. Around 54,000 Co-operative Bank customers will . now face the 0.5% increase - meaning payments will typically go up by . around £15 a month, or £180 a year. The average borrower has a remaining . balance of £48,000 and 11.5 years left on their term would see their . monthly repayment increase from £440 to £455 a month. The bank has blamed changing conditions in the mortgage market and the increased cost of funding for the rise. The other lenders have used the same excuse after announcing they were also raising rates in late February and March. Experts say homeowners are already squeezed and the move will pile on the pressure to thousands of homeowners. The hikes have previously been branded 'shocking' by the Consumer Action Group. In reaction to the hike, a Which? spokesperson said: . 'At a time when people's household budgets are already squeezed, providers increasing the standard variable rate on mortgages will pile the pressure on thousands who have been relying on low base rates to keep their homes affordable.' Borrowers will be hit hard but lenders in an uncompetitive market know many people have no means to escape these rate hikes. People have effectively become mortgage prisoners because they are unable to move to another provider,' he added. The Co-op Bank said it recognised that . some customers who have a higher loan-to-value (LTV) on their mortgage . may be 'particularly concerned' about the change and measures have been . put in place to offer alternative options. The . bank is launching a new product specifically for those customers with a . higher LTV who are seeking an alternative, which is a five-year fixed . rate mortgage, available at the same rate they currently pay. Squeeze on homeowners: The bank has blamed changing conditions in the mortgage market and the increased cost of funding for the rise . The Co-op Bank also offers other products including fixed rate and tracker mortgages. Earlier this month, the financial regulator warned that homeowners in their 50s are sitting on ‘a ticking timebomb’ of mortgages handed out during the boom years. During a grilling by MPs, Martin Wheatley, a director of the Financial Services Authority, raised his fears about interest-only mortgages which are coming to the end of their life – but the homeowners have no money to pay off the loan. Of the 11.2million mortgages in Britain, about four in ten are interest-only, meaning the homeowners pay only the interest but not a penny of the actual loan. Between 2011 and 2020, the FSA expects about 1.5million such mortgages – worth a staggering £120billion – ‘will be due for repayment’. Mr Wheatley told the Treasury select committee: ‘There is a ticking timebomb that has been created over the last 20 years.’ The FSA said its figures mean 150,000 interest-only mortgages will come to the end of their life every year for the next decade. The vast majority of people with these types of loans – 80 per cent – have ‘no repayment strategy’, the FSA said. Others have been saving, but have been bitterly disappointed by how their investments have performed. David Hollingworth, from the independent mortgage advisers, London and Country, warned some mortgage holders ‘will potentially have nowhere to go’. They also face new age restrictions, which means they will not be given a new loan unless it ends before they reach the age of 75. It means a homeowner in their late 50s would not be able to take out another 25-year loan. Lenders are running up rates with the excuse of higher funding costs, but this is really about boosting margins and those borrowers unable to jump ship as their equity has declined due to falling house prices will now be stuck on higher rates.Most standard variable rates are considerably above the 1.03 per cent money market LIBOR measure of floating rate funding and the 3 per cent needed to be offered to pull in easy access savings cash.In their defence, lenders are suffering higher regulatory costs - as the British Bankers Organisation argued here - but the financial system is also awash with cheap money.The 0.5 per cent base rate has been here for three years, UK taxpayers alone have pumped £325bn in through quantitative easing, and now European taxpayers are funding another £1trillion in cheap cash for the banking industry through the Long Term Refinancing Operation.","Move will affect 54,000 Co-operative Bank customers .

Theresa May was warned of a 'possible temporary shortfall' in G4S guards for the Olympics as early as June 27 - two weeks before she claimed, it emerged today. She said G4S and Locog met at the Home Office at the end of last month and said they were 'experiencing scheduling problems' which could see a shortfall of 'significantly less than 1,000' guards. But the firm was 'unable to specify the size of the shortfall' and only said they were no longer confident of reaching their workforce targets on July 11. Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured in the House of Commons earlier this week, was warned of a potential security shortfall at the end of last month . The revelation, an embarrassing one for the Home Office, came to light in a letter from Mrs May to Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. It emerged as another 1,200 troops were put on standby to provide Olympics security tonight as the fallout from the G4S chaos continued. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the numbers of staff provided by the company were rising, and there was currently no need to deploy more military personnel. Mrs May wrote: 'On June 27 G4S and Locog attended an Olympics Security Board meeting at the Home Office and said they were experiencing scheduling problems. 'They warned of a possible temporary shortfall in G4S deployed number from July 1. Mrs May went on: 'Locog and G4S were pressed to clarify the shortfall and factors which had created it urgently. Mrs May admitted that permission to put 'a small part of the MCF' on 24 hours notice was sought as early as June 28, with the force being mobilised 'several days later'. Filling in: Members of the Armed Forces are . shown around the site of the Olympic Park. More service personnel had to . be drafted in after G4S failed to provide enough security guards . Ed Miliband called today for G4S to be blocked from getting new Government contracts in the wake of the Olympics security shambles. The Labour leader said no more deals should be signed until a review had been carried out to ensure the firm was fit to provide services. Make it clear: The Labour leader said no more deals should be signed until a review had been carried out to ensure the firm was fit to provide services . He also accused the coalition of opening the door to private companies carrying out core police roles. His attack came as Prime Minister David Cameron reiterated his vow to 'go after' G4S to make it repay the millions of pounds in extra costs incurred as a result of the fiasco. G4S has rarely been out of the . headlines since it admitted it had failed to employ enough staff . to fulfill their £284million contract obligations. As a result around . 3,500 troops have been parachuted in to help secure the Games as well as hundreds more police officers from forces around the country. 'People want bobbies on the beat, not G4S,' said Mr Miliband. 'We need to be much clearer about what private companies should and should not do.' The comments came as Mr Miliband launched Labour’s campaign for Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) elections in central London. He insisted it 'beggared belief' that G4S was trying to cling on to a £57 million management fee for Olympics security. But he refused to call for the immediate resignation of chief executive Nick Buckles, suggesting the Games needed stability. 'Clearly the company will have serious questions to answer about new leadership (after) the Olympic Games,' Mr Miliband said. Not happy: David Cameron vowed to 'go after' G4S to get it to repay millions of pounds over the Olympic security scandal yesterday . In a humiliating appearance before MPs earlier this week, Mr Buckles admitted there would be financial consequences from the company’s failure to recruit enough staff. But he dismissed the idea of giving up the multimillion-pound management charge. Mr Miliband said: 'I don’t think G4S should receive their £57 million management fee for services provided to the Olympic games. 'Frankly it beggars belief that they think they are entitled to it.' Under pressure: No10 sources said the Government 'will be very aggressive' in reclaiming funds from G4S. Its chief executive Nick Buckles, is pictured . There is speculation that a request may be made today for up to 2,000 additional troops to plug any further gaps in security if G4S’s problems become more severe. The Ministry of Defence, which has already upped its contribution by 3,500, said contingency plans were in place to increase the numbers again if necessary. G4S is already involved in £600 million of private work for the Home Office alone, and had been hoping to increase its share of the market. However, Mr Miliband said the security giant’s ambition must be put on hold. 'Before they are awarded any new policing contracts, we need a review of G4S’s ability to deliver,' he said. Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband have stressed that they expect the Games to be a major success despite the problems as the row continues to overshadow the final build-up. The Prime Minister has approved plans . to raise the number of military personnel deployed to protect the . Olympics to 19,000 – double the number of troops now fighting in . Afghanistan.

Sports minister Hugh Robertson said lawyers have been deployed to . trigger 'penalty clauses' in G4S's contract.

Bright lights: A view of Hackney Wick as flood lights are tested at the Olympic stadium . 'I think it's very important that we allow them to try and carry out the role that they are contracted to deliver. 'But of course the Government's interest, the interest of the Olympic Games, the interest of everyone in our country is to make sure that whatever it is necessary to do to deliver a safe and secure and successful Games is done. 'We've always had contingency plans in place to deliver just that. We activate those contingency plans as and when necessary to do that. 'But I couldn't be clearer - we will do what is necessary and contracts that aren't fulfilled will have consequences, including pretty tough financial consequences. 'I think G4S, in apologising for their performance, have already made clear that they realise that fact.' Later, Jeremy Hunt sought to reassure Olympic ticket holders from around the world that the Games would be safe and secure. When asked at an Olympic Park press conference if yesterday's bomb attack on a bus full of Israeli holidaymakers in Bulgaria presented extra security challenges to the Games, the Culture Secretary replied: 'Obviously we're monitoring the whole time what's happening with respect to the changing security situation. 'We have extremely competent intelligence services who are giving us advice and we're responding to that on an ongoing basis. 'But the world can be absolutely certain that we will deliver a safe and secure Olympics. It's always been our number one priority.'

A Russian banker who was shot six times in a failed assassination attempt in London has called on his home country to mount an 'honest' investigation into the attack - as he repeated his claim to know who was behind it. German Gorbuntsov believes the hit was orchestrated by people with connections to the Kremlin. He was speaking from his bed in an unnamed London hospital, where he is being guarded around the clock by a team of 20 armed police. Target: German Gorbuntsov, who is being protected in his London hospital bed by armed police, says he knows who is behind the attempt on his life . A lone assassin fired at the 45-year-old banker as he entered his flat on Byng Street in the capital's Docklands on March 20. Mr Gorbuntsov, who is recovering after coming out of a coma, said he believed his former business partners were behind the shooting. 'I ask the authorities to be honest and to investigate what happened in a fair way,' Mr Gorbuntsov told the Independent. 'I want them to question me quickly, and hand over documents to Britain quickly.' Scotland Yard detectives have dismissed suggestions that Russian authorities are being obstructive in the case, but have admitted there are no named suspects. Mr Gorbuntsov suspects the investigation is being held up because the men he has named claim to be friends of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Concern: Mr Gorbuntsov, left, suspects the investigation is being held up because the men he has named claim to be friends of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, right . Critical: German Gorbuntsov was taken to hospital by ambulance after the attack . Speaking via a Skype internet . connection set up from his lawyers' Moscow office, he said he had been . interviewed repeatedly by British police but no one from Russia had . questioned him. 'The . evidence I have is enough to put them behind bars,' he said. 'Of course . they have good connections, but I'd like to believe there is justice in . Russia.' Scene: The doorway to an exclusive London block of flats where Mr Gorbuntsov was shot . The banker had fled to London to hide from his former business partners and said nobody knew where he was living. But he noticed he was being followed in the days before the shooting. He did not see the man who fired at him. Doctors have told Mr Gorbuntsov he will need to remain in hospital for up to three months, although his condition is stable. The banker and his lawyers believe he was attacked because he was preparing to give evidence to Russian prosecutors about a botched assassination attempt on his former business partner, Alexander Antonov. Mr Antonov, father of Vladimir Antonov, the former owner of Portsmouth Football Club, was shot in Moscow in 2009 but survived. Mr Gorbuntsov first named the men he suspects of being behind the killing in an interview with the Mail on Sunday in April. In that interview he recalled how he had just stepped out of a taxi and was punching in the entry code to his apartment block when his would-be assassin emerged from the shadows and opened fire. He said: ‘It had been an ordinary day and it was around 8pm when I got back home from my office in the City. 'I tapped in the code and when I got to the third digit I suddenly felt a terrible sharp pain in my stomach, and then another, and another.' The case bears similarities with the poisoning of Russian intelligence agent Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. No one has been convicted of Mr Litvinenko's murder, which led to a cooling of relations between Britain and Moscow.

Soaring temperatures could make tomorrow the hottest day of June so far, particularly in the South-East and London, where the mercury could reach highs of 29C (84f). But the respite will be all too brief, with scattered showers likely to return shortly afterwards, followed by thundery downpours towards the end of the week.

Murray fans flocked to see their hero on the Centre Court today and made the most of a rare spell of warm sunshine in south west London. While occasional spells of sunshine mixed with rain have seen flowers bloom across the country, there has been little sustained time to bask outdoors during an unreliable start to June. According to the Met Office, today will see cloud and rain spreading north-eastwards as the weather becomes warm and humid. Far north-east Scotland and, perhaps, parts of south-east England will stay dry but it will start to become humid in the south.

'There will be some bright and sunny spells on Friday with scattered showers. Some of the showers will be heavy particularly across Scotland.' Meanwhile, the brief spells of hot weather have seen a new range of pet care products launched in the UK - suncream for dogs. Research has shown that dogs are just as likely to get skin cancer as humans, so a company has developed canine-friendly sunblocks to combat the UV rays. The range includes a 'sunstick' that can be rubbed on to vulnerable areas like the muzzle, nose and ears, which are burnt most easily. There is also a 'sunmist' which can be sprayed anywhere and is most effective on 'light coloured or short haired dogs'. Wimbledon: The sun poked through the clouds for day two of the lawn tennis tournament on Centre Court . Handy ‘sunwipes’ are available for  extra protection, and can be used on any part of a canine’s body. Each of the three products compares itself with factor 15 suncreams for humans and promises to ‘help prevent sunburn’. Two of the Petkin products claim they provide ‘the fastest, most convenient way to protect your dog from sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays whenever they’re outdoors.’ Pet accessory distributor Sharples ‘n’ Grant brought the range to the UK from the US, after spotting a gap in the market - although there may not be much call for them for the foreseeable future. Murray mania: Andy Murray fans flocked to see their hero on the Centre Court today and made the most of a rare spell of warm sunshine in south west London . Committed: Wimbledon fans put England's defeat in Euro 2012 behind them and focused on the tennis - some even camped out to get hold of tickets to see Andy Murray . Warm wait: Tennis fans basked in the sunshine as they queued for Wimbledon tickets before the second day of play began today . Bright start: The crowds at Wimbledon enjoyed the tennis in shades and sunhats this morning - but it could be a different story by the end of the week . Paul Pugh, marketing director of Sharples ‘n’ Grant, said: 'Dogs, like us, can get skin cancer and if you look online there is a lot of research into this. 'A third of all tumours in dogs are sun related so we thought, there needs to be something to protect against it. 'Human suncreams can’t be used on dogs as there is the PABA chemical in them which is toxic to dogs. There wasn’t a product for dog skin protection on the market in the UK, so we have brought this range over and it will go into pet shops in two weeks' time.

Inappropriate: Nicola Newman, 33, made the comment when her colleague asked why she had not been invited to her hen party . A 'racist' nurse who imitated Ali G in front of a colleague has been found guilty of misconduct. Nicola Newman, 33, told colleague Marilyn Rowe she was not invited to her hen party in Las Vegas 'coz you is black' in front of other employees at Birmingham Children's Hospital. The comment, which Ms Newman said was 'banter' left Ms Rowe feeling 'disgusted' and 'quite upset' and was judged by a member of a misconduct panel as being racist. The Nursing and Midwifery Council accepted Newman, a junior sister at the time, had been imitating the comic character and intended the remark as banter. But panel chairman John Haines insisted its content was racist, whether it was said in jest or not, adding the behaviour 'clearly' amounted to misconduct. He continued: 'For a junior sister to direct a racist joke at a staff nurse in a hospital ward is so clearly misconduct that the contrary cannot be argued. 'It's vital to proclaim to members of the profession and public at large that this type of behaviour is never to be condoned.' The hearing was told the conversation took place in front of other employees and near a patient on ward 10 of Birmingham Children's Hospital. Newman later approached her colleague to say she had only been 'having a laugh' by alluding to Ali G's catch phrase: 'Is it coz I is black?' Panel chairman Mr Haines said there was concern at Newman's 'limited' insight into her actions and had decided, as a result, that her fitness to practise was impaired. Comedy act: Sacha Baron Cohen's Ali G character used 'Is it coz I'm black' as one of his many catchphrases . Asked by Chloe Binding, for the NMC, whether Newman had replicated his accent or body language, Ms Rowe replied: 'No, not at all. She said 'it's because you are black.' Ms Rowe continued: 'I felt quite distressed to be honest. I was quite upset about it. 'It was a joke about my colour. Something I did not ask for and something I did not find funny. 'I thought it was a racist joke. Words said as humour to one person is not humour to someone else.' But Chris Green, defending, insisted Newman - who apologised that night - had used Ali G's exact words and added actions to stress her point. He said Ms Rowe laughed along with the others at first, before abruptly changing her mind. Mr Green also suggested to Ms Rowe - who said she had used a 'jokey' tone when asking why she had not been invited to the hen do - she should have expected a 'humorous' reply. The panel accepted Newman's account as it was consistent with the recollections of the other colleagues present. Newman admitted making an 'inappropriate' remark to Ms Rowe on or around August 12, 2007, but denied being racist. She was also accused of asking a Muslim colleague Ferhat Shaheen whether she wore a headscarf because her hair was greasy on a night-out in July 2007. Newman accepted making an 'inappropriate' comment, but denied being racist and using those exact words. Colleagues: Ms Newman and Ms Rowe had been working together at Birmingham Children's Hospital when the 'offensive' comment was made . The panel agreed the comment was not racist, but 'disparaging to religion' and therefore amounted to misconduct as well. A third allegation, that Newman asked staff nurse Alia Murtaza at some point in 2006 when Ramadan was going to end because she was 'suffering', was found not proved. The hearing will continue at a later date, where Ms Newman will find out what sanction she faces for the misconduct charge.","Marilyn Rowe felt 'disgusted' and 'quite upset' at 'joke'

Charged: Businessman Christopher Nathaniel, seen here on the left at a meeting with Chelsea footballer Ashley Cole (second left) and U.S. rapper Jay-Z, was one of nine men who appeared in court today over the fatal stabbing of 18-year-old Danny O'Shea . Links: Nathaniel (left) was a director of Manchester United footballer Rio Ferdinand's Live The Dream Foundation, which helps disadvantaged youngsters. He quit the post just five days before his arrest in March . Last year he brokered a deal, believed to be worth several million pounds, allowing Chelsea star Cole to open a London branch of U.S. rapper Jay-Z's 40/40 restaurant and bar franchise. After clinching the deal, he said: 'We . have done some exciting deals and worked with some world class names, . but this collaboration of Ashley Cole and Jay-Z has to be one of the . most exciting and it makes the nine months of negotiations worth it.' He was also a director of former England footballer Rio Ferdinand's Live The Dream Foundation, which helps disadvantaged youngsters and is understood to have acted as middle man in a book deal for another England defender, John Terry. He was initially arrested by police at Heathrow airport in March in connection with the killing of Mr O'Shea, who was stabbed in the neck outside his mother's house after being chased down the street by a mob. Victim: Danny O'Shea, 18, was stabbed to death in Canning Town, east London, in December . Mr O'Shea's stepfather desperately tried to stop the flow of blood and gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but it was in vain. Paramedics fought for 30 minutes to save his life, but he was pronounced dead at the scene in front of horrified neighbours. Nathaniel had just returned from the U.S. when he was seized in March. He and eight other men were formally charged when they answered their bail yesterday.

With his fondness for a drink or two, a wicked way with the ladies and a relentlessly mischievous nature, Prince Harry's playboy ways have earned . him countless headlines over the years. Just this week, his riotous five day trip to Las Vegas culminated with nude photos splashed across the internet - and no doubt a severe drubbing from his grandmother after he returned, fully-clothed and sheepish to receive a dressing down from his press secretary at Clarence House this morning. Now, in honour of the fun-loving prince's safe return to the fold, thanks to spoof photographer Alison Jackson, MailOnline can reveal how similar scenes might have played out if Harry's conduct on his earlier foreign trips this year had matched that of his week in Sin City. Up to his tricks again? Spoof clips of Prince Harry misbehaving while on tour have been created by photographer Alison Jackson . Truth is stranger than fiction: The images Jackson dreamed up turned out to be less outrageous than the real scenes played out in Vegas over the past week, when Harry was pictured cavorting naked in his hotel suite . Earlier in 2012 Prince Harry undertook an official tour on behalf of the Queen as part of her Jubilee celebrations, which took in Brazil and Jamaica. By all accounts, the young royal made an excellent impression - charming dignitaries and locals alike - including large swathes of the female population who by all accounts lavished the eligible bachelor with attention. But what would have happened if Harry had succumbed to the temptation to let his hair down, Vegas style, on those occasions? Meeting the locals: Alison Jackson imagines how Prince Harry's official tours abroad could have gone if he'd truly let his hair down . As part of a new series starting tomorrow, Alison Jackson imagines the scenes... with hilarious results. In one scene, filmed with impressive . foresight way before the happenings in Vegas, Harry strips off his . trousers to reveal Union flag boxer shorts before diving, still wearing . the rest of his clothes, into a swimming pool. In . another, he parties poolside with a gaggle of bikini-clad girls . (sounding familiar?) before they corner him in a hammock and pour . cocktails into his open mouth while he blows smoke rings after smoking . what looks like a marijuana cigarette. Doubletake: Jackson is famous for creating portraits of celebrities caught off guard in awkward situations using lookalikes . In a clip of what Jackson imagines could have been the sort of shenanigans that went on during his Brazil tour, Harry eyes are on stalks as a carnival dancer shakes her nipple tassels at him as she advances on the flustered prince. For Alison Jackson, who usually imagines the most outrageous and unlikely scenes in which to portray her fake subjects, the irony cannot be lost that for once, the scenes she has come up with have been trumped soundly by the antics of the real Harry himself just one day before the clips were due for release. Let's just hope the Queen realises they are fake before she takes her grandson to task again.

Inspirational paratrooper Ben Parkinson, 27, is the most injured British servicemen to have survived after he lost both his limbs and broke his back, hips and ribs when his Land Rover hit a mine in Afghanistan in 2006. Doctors believed he wouldn't be able to recover from such serious wounds - 37 in total - but thanks to his sheer determination Ben has proved them all wrong with his amazing progress. But his mother Diane Dernie, who refused to give up on him, today reveals how she faced an up-hill battle to get Ben the help he needed from the MoD to aid his path to recovery. Diane Dernie, pictured with Ben on Mother's Day, said her son Ben has made unbelievable progress and his memory is returning . Ben spent four months in a coma that experts thought he would never awake from but when he miraculously did revive Diane claims the MoD were just concerned about the cost of his rehabilitation. Under the advice of a surgeon, Ben underwent surgery so he would be able to sit in a wheelchair, but at the same time was discharged from the army hospital at Headley Court with no carers or help provided for him at home. She told The Times newspaper: 'They saved his life but they would rather him die than pay for him to recover. People were saying that Headley Court was being blocked by people who couldn't be rehabilitated. 'I suppose our view of the MoD is that there is very little care for the soldier as a person. The soldiers lives have never been worth a great deal.' Paratrooper, Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson, 27, the most seriously wounded soldier to survive the war in Afghanistan, as he carries the Olympic Flame through his home town of Doncaster . Amazing spirit: Thousands of people lined the streets of Doncaster to show their support to the torch relay's bravest participant as paratroopers from Ben's regiment supported him all the way . It was while Ben was still in a coma that Diane said she received an 'invoice' of Ben's compensation for his injuries amounting to just £152,000. After consulting a solicitor she managed to force a judicial review to fight the compensation scheme. Ben's compensation is now capped at the Government limit of £570,000. She added: 'We were able to fight the system. And Ben has forced the way so the same thing never happens to another boy.' Diane added that the MoD is very . separate to the soldiers and their regiments. While soldiers are very . loyal to eachother, the army, Queen and country, they are not loyal to . the MoD who just see them as a 'commodity'. Ben suffered a total of 37 terrible injuries when he was blown up by a landmine. He lost both his legs and sustained grievous damage to his spine, skull, pelvis, hands, spleen and ribcage, leaving him in a coma for months . Ben was just 22 when he was thrown 30 metres from a Land Rover from the blast of a 30-year-old Russian anti-tank mine in Afghanistan. He landed on his head causing severe brain injury while his legs were crushed, his pelvis broken as well as his arms, hand and fingers and his jaw was fractured. Despite all of this, he has fought an ongoing battle over the last six years to regain his memory and overcome his injuries. This culminated last week with Ben carrying the Olympic torch for 300 metres - taking 27 painful and exhausting minutes. He was determined to do it on his new prosthetic legs, scoffing at the offer to be pushed in a wheelchair or use crutches. Proud paratroopers from Ben's regiment, the 7th Parachute Royal Horse Artillery unit, supported him all the way. Few who saw Ben could fail to have been inspired by his strength of character as he walked slowly by the cenotaph in his home town of Doncaster. Speaking on the day, he said: 'I am very proud. I didn’t realise how much support I had, I was amazed.’ His mother Diane added: ‘I cried from start to finish. People were shouting and cheering. I couldn’t believe so many had turned out. 'It's the proudest moment of my life. We knew Ben would complete the route. He's so determined.' Ben was accompanied by 25 colleagues from 7 Para Royal Horse Artillery and his commanding officer Major David Walker said: ‘My men would have crawled over broken glass to be here today to show Ben our support. 'Everyone in the regiment is tremendously proud of the progress that he's made against incredible adversity. 'We're immensely proud of the physical and mental courage he shows in overcoming major injuries. It's nothing short of awe-inspiring.'","Paratrooper Ben Parkinson lost both legs and suffered brain injuries after driving over a mine in Afghanistan .

Police officers have told of their terror during a ‘living hell’ in the riots last summer. They were threatened with guns and machetes as the violence left them in fear of their lives and feeling like they were ‘in a movie’. Riot teams were left hopelessly outnumbered as reinforcements were not mobilised by senior officers quickly enough, added officers. Many fear rioting could erupt again this summer because of continuing social unease. Summer of chaos: Reeves Furniture Store burns to the ground in Croydon, south London, during four days of rioting in the capital last summer . Show of strength: The disorder eventually came to an end when 16,000 officers were sent out on the streets of London after four nights of chaos . But they warned that efforts to counter trouble would be hampered by budget cuts. A superintendent in Greater Manchester said: ‘We arrested 300 people but a lot of people on the periphery got away with it. ‘Probably, if I was them, I’d have . thought “yeah, I’d do it again, and probably get away with it next . time”.’ The anonymous accounts from more than 130 officers in eight . forces were collected in interviews by researchers. 'I think if you have bad economic times, hot weather, . some sort of an event that sets it off...my answer is: yes, it could (happen again).' 'Because I don't think anything has . changed between now and last August, and the only thing that's different . is people have thought: riots are fun.' They had been on the front line as the riots spread across London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Salford in August 2011. Many officers said they were astonished no-one was killed as rioters armed themselves with knives, sticks and makeshift weapons. Nearly all the police interviewed described . the unrest as the greatest physical and psychological challenge of their . careers. Violence: A rioter hurls a rock at riot police in Hackney as a car burns during the disorder last summer . Looted: A woman is detained outside a Currys store in Brixton last summer as riot police are deployed to try and bring the chaos to a halt . A 33-year-old senior officer said rioters tried to roll burning cars at colleagues in East London. He said: ‘You cannot believe this is . happening in an area of Hackney where people go and have a cup of . coffee. This is London, it’s not Beirut. ‘The lawlessness was just . unbelievable. And there seemed to be this anti-police feeling, even from . people whose property we were trying to protect.’ In Tottenham, a 52-year-old senior . officer said his riot helmet was split in half by a block of masonry . which knocked him unconscious. He said: ‘I had a splitting headache. There was no other option but to remain on duty and do my duty. I was . at the sharp end for just over four hours, no respite. A superintendent from Greater Manchester Police . ‘I had no doubt that if an officer . had become detached from the main body and taken off on their own, they . would’ve been killed.’ A 35-year-old sergeant in Liverpool . said battling rioters was like a scene from the film Zulu. He said: . ‘Three hundred people came round the corner and started attacking us. As . I had my visor down, it was like watching a TV screen.’ The project was carried out by the London School of Economics and The Guardian. A . 29-year-old constable recalled how he was forced to use his iPhone to . navigate their way to trouble in Tottenham as they travelled across the . capital to the disorder. A 25-year-old special constable on his first shift was left all on his own in Hackney, east London, being taunted by looters on Monday August 7 outside a branch of JD Sports. Fearing for his life at the hands of the mob, he managed to defuse the situation by putting his arm round one of the rioters and posing for a photograph. As riots spread across cities last summer, police were left drowning in a blizzard of often bogus intelligence. Rioters discussed tactics on BlackBerry Messenger - but officers were unable to access the messages. In exasperation they were forced to turn to Twitter in an attempt to stay one step ahead of the trouble-makers. But the Reading the Riots study revealed that officers ended up wasting their time checking out non-existent incidents. A bronze commander from Manchester said they would receive a report of 50 masked men 'on Regent Road' - only to find out that they weren't there. Officers found that senior officers were out of touch with where trouble was brewing - and some of the best information came from people on the ground. Senior Metropolitan Police officers . also accepted they struggled to deploy enough staff to contain the . violence during the four days of disorder in the capital. They . failed to activate a national alarm system to call for more resources . until the third day of riots - and once officers from other forces did . arrive they were hampered by poor communication with central command. There were just 3,380 officers on duty in the capital when disorder first broke out in London following the shooting of Mark Duggan by police officers on August 7. By the third night this had risen only to 6,000 - before a massive show of strength brought the chaos to an end when 16,000 officers were sent out on August 10. The Metropolitan Police had initially relied on local contacts to bring officers into London - and it was only on the third day that they used the National Information Co-ordination Centre to obtain back-up. Even once outside help was summoned, officers from provincial forces were left dealing with minor incidents as the capital burned. A 30-year-old Cambridgeshire Police constable told the researchers he could not be deployed in Hackney or Croydon where some of the worst disorder was seen because they could not access the Metropolitan Police radio channel. Another constable, 37, from the same force told the Guardian: 'It was just frustrating that we blue-lighted all the way down from Cambridgeshire to there, and never really got used for anything apart from sitting in car parks and going to deal with shoplifters in Tesco or Sainsbury's.' Destroyed: The 140-year-old Reeves Furniture Store in Croydon lies in ruins after an arson attack during the disorder. It had survived the Blitz and the Great Depression . The Metropolitan Police use their own radio channel rather than the standard Airwave system that other police forces use. Forces . across England also failed to fully act on intelligence gleaned from . social media networks, which were used by rioters to outmanoeuvre . police, the interviews revealed. A Cambridgeshire constable . Officers from West Midlands, Merseyside, . Greater Manchester, Cambridgeshire, Thames Valley, Hampshire, Surrey . and the Metropolitan Police, were interviewed as part of the study. Paul McKeever, chairman of the Police Federation, said police would struggle to cope with further disorder if the proposed austerity measures went ahead and urged the government to take 'urgent stock' of the results of the study. He said: 'This comprehensive analysis demonstrates what we have been telling the Government for two years now; that a 20 per cent budget cut to policing will have a negative impact on public safety and that police numbers really do matter. 'Officers interviewed rightly identify and voice concern that, should the same circumstances occur again, the police service would struggle to cope and contain the situation with the loss of police officers numbers we are experiencing as a direct result of the cuts - over 5,000 last year alone.'","Researchers interviewed 130 officers for study into causes of riots .

Sussex police chief Martin Richards (pictured) has been reported to the police watchdog amid allegations of 'undue influence' in a criminal investigation into a sexual assault . A chief constable is under investigation for misconduct over claims he meddled in a police inquiry into an alleged sex attack. Sussex Police Chief Constable Martin Richards has been reported to the police watchdog amid allegations of ‘undue influence’ in a criminal investigation into a sexual assault. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) launched a probe after the extraordinary claims were made last month by a member of his staff via an anonymous internal reporting system. Details of the specific criminal case cannot be reported for legal reasons as it involves a serious sexual assault of a woman which has yet to come to trial. There is no suggestion that the top policeman is implicated in any way in the case, but he is accused of interfering in the investigation led by his officers. The officer, who is married with two sons and two stepsons, is one of the most senior officers in Britain. He is the chair of the Association of Chief Police Officers South East Region and the regional lead for Serious and Organised Crime. After graduating from Bristol University, Mr Richards joined Warwickshire Police in 1982 before being promoted to Assistant Chief Constable at Avon and Somerset Constabulary in 1998. In 2002 he was promoted to Deputy Chief Constable in before moving to become Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police in September 2004. Mr Richards joined Sussex Police as Chief Constable in 2007 and was awarded the Queen’s Police Medal the following year. Yesterday the IPCC said it was investigating an allegation of misconduct after Sussex Police Authority voluntarily referred the matter last month following consideration by its Professional Standards Committee.

He wrote: ‘Colleagues, last month the Sussex Police Authority voluntarily referred an allegation against me of misconduct to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.‘ . They have launched an independent investigation and I have pledged to cooperate fully personally and to provide any support required from the force to help them establish the facts. ‘While the IPCC investigation is ongoing, my priority is to maintain business as usual and protect the service we provide to the public. ‘The delivery of normal business - including my responsibilities and those of my senior team - will continue as usual.’ The officer, who is regarded as an experienced chief and a ‘safe pair of hands’, is currently having to make £50million cuts, which means the force will have fewer frontline officers than any other police force in the country after scrapping 470 jobs by 2015.

A hotel receptionist knifed a colleague to death before dumping his body on a bed and hiding inside the divan for two days, a court heard today. Attila Ban, 32, stabbed 20-year-old Tibor Vass before murdering the victim’s girlfriend, Alice Adams, also 20, it is alleged. Hungarian-born Ban then cut off his fellow countryman’s clothes before leaving him naked and posed on a double bed in the flat they shared, the Old Bailey was told. Killed: Hotel receptionist Attila Ban, 32, stabbed 20-year-old Tibor Vass, left, before murdering the victim’s girlfriend, Alice Adams, also 20, right, it is alleged. All three worked at the Radisson at Heathrow Airport . Ban, who had been named Employee of the Year at the hotel where he and his victims worked, tried to avoid detection by crawling into the bed’s divan base, where he hid for two days, jurors heard. He denies murdering the pair, but has admitted manslaughter in each case, claiming he was mentally ill when he launched his frenzied attack. He wept loudly in the dock as prosecutor Richard Whittam QC opened the facts of the case to jurors. ‘As you will hear, two young people both met a violent and unjustified death at the hands of this defendant,’ said Mr Whittam. ‘Although it has been said before about other cases, it is difficult to find words to describe what happened in this case other than to state it was a tragedy that two young people should meet their death in the way they did.’ Ban and his two victims all worked at the Radisson Edwardian Hotel at Heathrow Airport, west London, and he and Mr Vass shared a flat behind the hotel. The openly gay killer had become attached to Mr Vass after he started work in August 2010, having moved to the UK after unsuccessfully applying for a university place. Attila Ban allegedly had crush on Tibor Vass and was jealous of his girlfriend Alice Adams . ‘Tibor Vass had been in relationships with women who worked at the hotel and there is no evidence he ever had a sexual relationship with Attila Ban,’ said Mr Whittam. ‘Attila Ban did, however, appear to have affection for Tibor Vass and behaved in a slightly possessive way towards him.’ ‘A friend thought that Attila Ban “fancied Tibor too much”,’ he added. Ban had been jealous about Mr Vass’s relationships, and just days before the killing launched an outburst at his victim during a team building exercise when he took a picture that did not feature Ban, the court heard. Things came to a head when Ban learned Mr Vass had been accepted on a university course back in Hungary and was due to leave the UK at the end of the month. Friends also thought Mr Vass had begun a relationship with Alice Adams. Ban launched his attack in the early hours of August 10, after he was left alone with Mr Vass and Miss Adams following a party at the hotel-owned flat. ‘What happened thereafter may never be known,’ said Mr Whittam. ‘Alice Adams had been in touch with her boyfriend during the day. ‘She sent a text to her mother just after midnight to let her know that she might stay with a friend who lived next to the hotel.’ The next day, none of the three showed up for work, while a new post had appeared on Ban’s Facebook wall reading: ‘I’d like to wake up from this nightmare’. Police went to the flat in New Road, Harlington, and discovered the bodies of the victims. Mr Vass was lying naked on a bed and had been posed with his legs up and splayed. His T-shirt and boxer shorts had been cut off and discarded by the flat’s main door. Miss Adams was found underneath a window, clothed and with her face covered. Traces of DNA belonging to Mr Vass and Ban were found on her breasts. But Ban was nowhere to be found. It was not until two days later that he was discovered, lying naked on a bed. He had tried to slit his wrists with modelling knives and electrocute himself with a hairdryer in the bath. ‘It became apparent that he had been hiding in the divan base of the double bed,’ said Mr Whittam. ‘He must have been there throughout the attendance of the pathologist, the removal of the bodies and the examination of the scene by crime scene examiners. ‘He had enough presence of mind to have concealed himself effectively and to remain undetected throughout the time they were in the premises.’ Ban denies two counts of murder but has admitted manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility in each case. The trial will continue tomorrow. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Attila Ban allegedly had crush on Tibor Vass and was jealous of girlfriend Alice Adams .

Mario Balotelli has found himself at the centre of yet another race row after a leading Italian newspaper published a deeply offensive cartoon of him as King Kong. Gazzetta dello Sport likened the star striker to the mythical monster with an image of him swatting away footballs in the same way King Kong did aircrafts atop New York's Empire State Building. The Balotelli camp was understood to be outraged by the cartoon and Gazzetta have issued an apology. Unfunny: Mario Balotelli was personified as King Kong in the offensive Gazzetta cartoon . Force: Italian striker Mario Balotelli . controlling the ball against Ireland (left) and receiving a yellow card . against European and World Champions Spain (right) ‘It wasn’t our cartoonist’s best product. In these times we need a bit more moderation, caution and good taste. 'But we have always fought against racism and condemned booing against Balotelli as unacceptable,’ said the Milan-based newspaper. A spokesman for the anti-racism organisation Kick It Out said: ‘Mario is such an important person in Italian football. 'Aspiring players in Italy who want to follow in his footsteps could wonder what support they will have when they get to his level when they see cartoons like that. ‘It is not the first time we have seen this sort of depiction of Mario and we think the media have a responsibility. How do they think they can portray him like that?’ Journalists in Italy were horrified with . Luigi Garlando saying: ‘It's an unfortunate cartoon. It's hard to defend . the right of satire against censorship in this case. I would never . have allowed it.' Disgusting: An Italian councillor mocked up this picture of Mario Balotelli and posted it on his Facebook page . Anger: Paolo Ciani, 51, of the right wing Future and Liberty party, mocked up the photograph which showed Balotelli, 21, wearing his Italian shirt and bent over collecting cabbages in a field . Last week an Italian regional councillor sparked outrage after he posted on his Facebook page a picture of Balotelli working in fields as an immigrant worker. Paolo Ciani, 51, of the right wing Future and Liberty party, mocked up the photograph which showed Balotelli wearing his Italian shirt and bent over collecting cabbages in a field. The caption underneath referred to Balotelli's elbow against Ireland's Richard Dunne in his side's 2-0 win which went unseen by the match referee, the player's goal and then his foul mouthed outburst. Ciani wrote: 'He comes commits a foul worthy of a red card, scores then unleashes a verbal onslaught against the bench forcing them to shut him up. 'This clown should go and work in the fields.' In Italy it is not uncommon to see immigrants from Africa or South America working in fields collecting vegetables in searing heat. There have been numerous complaints over conditions they have to endure. Ciani's comments immediately provoked controversy with many accusing him of blatant racism. And it came after UEFA launched an investigation against Croatian fans after they threw bananas at Balotelli and aimed monkey chants at him. Time to focus: Balotelli and Italy will take on Germany in the Euro 2012 semi-final . Verbal: Italy's Mario Balotelli is hushed up by team-mates Thiago Motta, Leonardo Bonucci and Federico Balzaretti after he scored his goal against Ireland . Before the tournament started Manchester City striker Balotelli, who was born in Italy to Ghanaian immigrant parents, had vowed to walk off if he was racially abused. So far he has stayed on the pitch. Ciani, based in Trieste in north east Italy, an area well known for its nationalism, immediately hit back at claims he was being racist and at those who had attacked him via Facebook. He posted a picture of himself at a council meeting with a black resident adding: 'How can they accuse me of racism. I work with non European Union nationals. 'This is the best response to this presumed racism.' Married Ciani added: 'What I was doing was making a footballing comment, I was highlighting how Balotelli had committed a bad foul which could have got him sent off. Balotelli is now preparing for tomorrow's semi-final against Germany in Warsaw. Different approach: Mario Balotelli (left) relaxes as his teammates go through a punishing training session . On Tuesday UEFA also opened disciplinary proceedings against the Spanish football federation and the Russian football union for alleged racist behaviour and chanting by fans. European football’s governing body fined the Croatian football federation €30,000 after supporters threw fireworks and  displayed ‘inappropriate and racist banners’ during a match against Spain. It was Croatia’s second racism-related sanction of the tournament. In Krakow the focus for the Italians remained on trying to do to Germany what they did to England on Sunday night in Kiev. Andrea Pirlo, the architect of England’s destruction, appeared before the media and had few words of encouragement for Roy Hodgson’s beaten quarter-finalists. ‘Our approach to the game against Germany will be the same as against England,’ he said. ‘This is because it is the only way we can play. We have to take advantage of our quality, our technique. Charged: Meanwhile, UEFA have opened disciplinary proceedings against Spanish Russian FA's over the behaviour of their fans . 'But, unlike England,  Germany can create many threats to our defence. ‘England played a very prudent and careful way. They were sitting back all match, like Chelsea did in the Champions League final. They tried to keep that same shape. 'For them, going to the penalty shootout was already a good result.’  Pirlo said his stunning chip penalty was a key moment in the game because it was a huge psychological blow to England. ‘I didn’t celebrate the penalty because at that point there was nothing to celebrate,’ he said. ‘But it was really relevant to the match and our win. This changed the course of the match. 'For me, Joe Hart seemed to be very confident in himself and it seemed to be a psychological blow. I needed to do something to beat him.

He is thought to have been heavily . armed and well supplied, West confirmed that Keller has brought 'a . number of rifles, scopes and handguns' as well as a bullet-proof vest.

Media magnate David Geffen is moving on up – literally – to the extraordinary Fifth Avenue penthouse once owned by wealthy socialite Denise Rich. Rich, 68, the Grammy-nominated songwriter, top Democratic donor, and glamorous figure in European royalty circles, renounced her American passport in November, according to her lawyer, and has now sold her main home in the states for a paltry $54million. The Massachusetts-born socialite was originally asking $65million for the stunning 12,000 square-foot New York City duplex, but settled for a selling price of millions less. Moving on up: Media mogul David Geffen has just bought the seven bedroom, 11 bathroom penthouse on Fifth Avenue owned by Denise Rich . Grand views: The co-op offers a sweeping panorama of Grand Army Plaza and Central park . Shiny new beginnings: There are marble floors and 11-ft ceilings throughout . New and old: DreamWorks founder David Geffen, left, reportedly purchased Denise Rich's home for $54million; he currently lives one floor below in the exclusive Fifth Avenue co-op . By dumping her U.S. passport, Rich will likely save tens of millions of dollars or more in U.S. taxes over the long haul, tax lawyers say. However, she will still have to pay exit tax on her penthouse. It is a matter of much speculation that . the wealthy Ms Rich left the States so as not to pay any income tax - if . that is the case, than she can afford a few million dollars loss. The New York Post’s Page Six exclusively reported the massive sale, noting that Geffen already lives in the building and will likely spend two years renovating the space. Rich’s apartment is directly below the one he just purchased. Sources tell Page Six that Geffen plans on selling his old place rather than combining the two properties. The penthouse sits on Fifth Avenue, right outside of Grand Army Plaza, the Plaza Hotel, and Central Park. The Corcoran listing for the apartment calls it ‘the epitome of luxury and grandeur.’ Complete with 11-ft ceilings and custom mahogany doors, the apartment boasts seven bedrooms and 11 baths, as well a library, two fireplaces, and wraparound terraces. The plush apartment offers sweeping views of the city, all the way across Central Park and to Columbus Circle. The dining room, which is off of the chef’s kitchen, can seat 22, and leads to one of three terraces. Hearth and home: The property's library features a wood-burning fireplace, one of two in the 12,000 square foot home . Fancy feasts: The dining room, which overlooks one of three terraces, seats 22, and has an attached chef's kitchen . The suite life: The plush apartment offers sweeping views of the city, all the way across Central Park and west to Columbus Circle . At a loss? Geffen purchased the sprawling duplex for a reported $54million, $11million less than the listing price; he currently lives in an apartment on the floor below . Dream big: The Master Suite has two bathrooms and closets galore . Gutted: Rich had a professional recording studio in her home; it is reported that the DreamWorks founder will likely tear it out . The incredible space also has two kitchens, a full gym, and a professional recording studio that was used by Rich. Page Six reports that the DreamWorks founder will likely tear it out. But aside from the $54million price tag, Geffen will have to pay a monthly maintenance fee of $25,000. Rich has written songs recorded by Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige and Jessica Simpson, and Mandy Moore, to name a few. When she listed the apartment in January, Rich told the Post that she had outgrown the space, as her daughters had recently moved out. ‘My greatest hope is that the next family loves and enjoys this home as much as we did.’ She now plans to live in London, it is said, and is a frequent habitué of Cannes, Monte Carlo, and St. Tropez, often sailing to each port on her 157-ft yacht, Lady Joy. Dining in style: This is one of two kitchens in the co-op, complete with granite counter tops and stainless tell appliances .

Panoramic views: Looking out the window, one can see the Plaza Hotel, left, and the southern entrance to Central Park, with Columbus Circle to the west . View from the top: The private rooftop terrace also affords a sweeping view of Central Park . But Geffen and Rich were supposedly . not on the best of terms. According to Page Six, Geffen threatened to . take Rich to court after her Jacuzzi flooded, soaking parts of Geffen’s . apartment. She later settled with him out of court. Geffen, . 69, is a stalwart in the media world, with properties both in New York . and Malibu. He is the proud owner of a 453-foot yacht called the Rising . Sun, which he bought from Larry Ellison. He expanded his maritime collection after he reportedly purchased one of Roman Abramovich’s yachts, the 377-foot Pelorus, for $300million. Forbes ranks the University of Texas dropout’s net worth at $5.5billion. He began his career sorting mail at the William Morris talent agency, the magazine reports, and worked his way up from there. He parted ways from his much younger boyfriend, Jeremy Lingvall in February, the Post said. Lingvall, 28, is a graduate of the University of Santa Barbara.

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 05:07 EST, 16 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:56 EST, 16 July 2012 . A would-be police officer who completed just 10 days in the training academy before going on long-term leave has collected almost $500,000 in tax-free disability payments. Donald E. Barnes Jr, then 30, was undertaking a 'light jogging exercise' as part of his police training in Chicago, U.S. in 1997, when he collapsed and was rushed to hospital, where he was diagnosed with heat stroke and placed in intensive care due to kidney and liver failure. Despite never returning to complete his training or working a single day as a Chicago Police officer, Barnes has picked up cheques totalling almost $500,000 - around £321,000 - over the past 15 years. He can keep collecting his annual disability payment - which now amounts to $46,343 and will increase as the salary for an entry-level officer goes up - until he reaches the compulsory retirement age of 63. Donald E. Barnes Jr has picked up nearly $500,000 in tax-free payments during 15 years on disability leave from the Chicago Police Department . The now 45-year-old stands to receive at least $1.2 million from Chicago's police pension fund when he retires. After Barnes had used up his allotted year of sick leave following the collapse, the city's police pension board made the decision to place him on duty disability, citing the ongoing effects of heat stroke. He is entitled to free health insurance for his wife and their two children - both of whom were born after their father went on disability leave. Barnes, who uses a brace on his left foot and walks with a 'slight limp', according to pension records, has a second job as a regional manager for Standard Parking, which operates the car parks at Chicago's O'Hare Airport and Midway Airport. In Chicago, police officers are the only city employees allowed to take on outside jobs while on disability leave. Barnes underwent surgery and outpatient rehabilitation following his collapse in 1997, but has had 'no other treatment or follow-up' since then, according to a pension fund doctor's report dating from 2010. The doctor's report, which states that Barnes walks with a 'slight limp', deems him 'capable of performing a sedentary light-duty position' within the police department. If offered a limited-duty position at a desk Barnes would have to move back to Chicago from his current home in Lockport, Illinois. He is one of 347 Chicago police officers currently on disability leave. An investigation by the Chicago Sun-Times revealed that Chicago police officers on disability leave are in line for millions of dollars, mostly as a result of injuries sustained while on duty. Barnes, who declined to comment on the story, is one of two officers collecting disability payments as a result of injuries suffered while still in the police training academy. A total of 347 officers are on disability leave from the Chicago Police Department . The other, Michael Terrano, underwent surgery on an injured knee 17 years ago, then refused to return to work and was fired. Despite being sacked from the police force and taking on another job Terrano has still picked up disability payments worth more than $560,000. Terrano, who was 39 when he joined the police in 1995, has also taken on work outside the force since going on leave. He tore a ligament in his right knee while completing an obstacle course seven weeks into his training with the Chicago Police Department. After treatment Terrano completed his training and began work in the 19th District, but his knee swelled while on patrol in June 1996 and he was told it required surgery. By December doctors declared Terrano, of Naperville, Illinois, fit to return to work with the police, but he refused. He was sacked in September 1997 for violating the police department's sick-leave policy, but applied for disability benefits anyway. When the police pension board rejected his claim - stating that Terrano could still work in a limited-duty position - he sued. A judge ruled in favour of the pension board, but in 2000 the appeals court ordered the pension board to pay Terrano disability benefits. The reason given was that the police department had never offered him a limited-duty job. Terrano, who could not be reached for comment by the Chicago Sun-Times, is receiving $48,434 a year, tax-free, in disability payments. He stands to have collected a total of $900,000 by the time he reaches the mandatory retirement age of 63.","Police recruit Donald E. Barnes Jr collapsed while jogging on his tenth day of training .

The coroner heard Anita Hughes was drinking vodka at a Christmas Eve party but was found collapsed on the floor . A mother-of-three was killed by her Christmas Eve tipple with friends in a sudden and rare reaction to drinking vodka. Anita Hughes, 44, died from a 'largely unrecognised phenomenon' when her heart stopped after the festive drink. An inquest heard she suffered Sudden Unexpected Death in Alcohol Misuse (SUDAM) - a condition which leads to 1,000 deaths in the UK every year. The coroner heard divorced Miss Hughes was drinking vodka at a Christmas Eve party with her partner and friends at home. When her children woke up on Christmas morning, they found their mother collapsed on the floor. She was taken to hospital in Wrexham, North Wales, where she was pronounced dead. Acting coroner for North East Wales John Gittins recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: 'Sudden Unexpected Death in Alcohol Misuse is a largely unrecognised phenomenon. This is a very sad loss of life. 'If the brain gets deranged and electrical signals go amiss then you can have a situation called cardiac arrhythmia. 'The signals that tell the heart to beat go awry and the heart simply stops. 'Alcohol can cause that if used excessively. 'I hope the circumstances of this death, traumatic as they are, do not take away from your memories of Miss Hughes.' Miss Hughes was found collapsed on Christmas morning by her children and taken to Wrexham Maelor Hospital where she was pronounced dead . Divorced Miss Hughes, from Brymbo, Wrexham, was mother to Karly, 22, and sons Ricky, 20, and Scott, 13. The inquest heard the cafe catering assistant normally drank twice a week but had shared vodka on Christmas Eve. Toxicology tests showed Miss Hughes was more than four times over the legal drink-driving limit. Pathologist Dr Anthony Howell Burdge confirmed the most likely cause of death was SUDAM. Paying tribute to her sister, Miss Jones said: 'She was very fun-loving, and she loved her children. 'She had always worked.

Rajwinder Kaur, of Queens, New York, left home on Sunday to go and do volunteer work at a homeless centre in Brooklyn at around 8pm and never returned. Later that evening Kaur's sister, Gurpreet, received a text message from the 26-year-old's phone. It read: 'The girl with this phone is dead, was smiling'. Mystery: Rajwinder Kaur, of Queens, New York, left her 198th Street, Hollis home on Sunday to go and do volunteer work at a homeless centre in Brooklyn at around 8pm and never returned . At first the family hoped the text was a joke but as the seriousness of the message sank in they began to fear the worst. 'It's too disturbing,' Gurpreet told NBC4, adding to CBS New York: 'I was reading it and it didn’t make sense and I worried, what’s going on?' Kaur's brother-in-law Kulwinder Bhinder told the station: 'We are very nervous, we are scared. I know Raji. She will never send a message like that. Harrowing: Not long after Kaur left the home her sister received this text message . 'There may be some bad, cracked person she faced that night, and that’s the scary part. Police said Kaur's phone was tracked to Brooklyn that night where it was then shut off. No other trace of her has been found. She has not used an ATM or credit card. Police are awaiting a warrant so that they can go through her emails to look for clues. They fear she may have joined a cult, speculating that the text message could be interpreted to mean 'the old Rajwinder is dead to you, the new Rajwinda is with us'.

A homosexual, devout Mormon who is married to a woman and has three children has outed himself via a blog post. Josh Weed from Auburn, Washington, wrote a detailed post last Thursday on The Weed, his blog, which explored his life as a closeted gay man. Although Lolly Weed, his wife, knew of his secret for some years prior to their marriage, the post revealed his sexuality to many of the couple's friends and family for the first time. Family man: Josh Weed (top left) is a married Mormon who outed himself as a gay man via his blog last week. He and his wife Lolly (top right), who knew his secret, have three children (l-r: Anna, Viva and Tessa) The post, which aims to answer questions that he and his wife preempt those close to them will have, goes into detail about Mr Weed's love for his wife and their sexual relationship. 'Lolly and I have an extremely healthy and robust sex life,' he wrote last week, as the couple were celebrating their ten year anniversary. Mr Weed, a family and marriage specialist, has never had sex with a man but claimed he is certainly homosexual and not bisexual. He wrote: 'Some might assume that because I'm married to a woman, I must be bisexual. Sexual orientation is defined by attraction, not by experience. In my case, I am attracted sexually to men. Period. I've never been turned on by a Victoria's Secret commercial in my entire life.' Happily married: Josh and Lolly Weed have been happily married for ten years despite his sexual orientation . The blog post, which is in part written by Lolly, explores everything from when Mr Weed discovered he was gay - he was '11 or 12' - to why he wants to 'grow old' with his wife. He added that despite his love and attraction to his wife, he is gay and will never become a bisexual. 'I have many, many years of experience which confirm this to be true, but it’s really as simple as what a girl asked me in junior high,' he wrote. '""If everyone in this room took off their clothes, would you be turned on by the girls or the guys?” My answer, which I didn't say out loud, was unquestionably the guys.' Mr Weed told his wife that he was gay when the couple went on their first date; Mr Weed was just 16. 'We have an extremely healthy and robust sex life... [but] I've never been turned on by a Victoria's Secret commercial in my entire life' He assured his readers early in the post that his words were 'written from the standpoint of a devout, believing Mormon'. He admitted that he was forced to reveal his secret after he began sharing personal information with his work clients. 'My clinical work as a therapist is taking me in the direction of helping clients who struggle to reconcile their sexual orientation with their religious beliefs,' he wrote. 'I have decided to be open with these clients about my own homosexuality, and in doing so have opened the door to people finding out about this in ways I can’t control.' Mrs Weed revealed that the pair met as 'small children' living on the same street in Utah. She wrote in one of the blog's most moving paragraphs: 'I knew that I loved Josh... I wanted to marry Josh Weed because I loved the man that he was. I loved everything that made him him. I didn’t want anyone else. I knew that we had the kind of relationship that could work through hard trials and circumstances. I did not choose to marry someone who is gay. I have never regretted it.'","Josh Weed and his wife Lolly from Auburn, Washington have a 'healthy and robust' sex life according to the blog post ."

BBC bosses have been accused of wasting taxpayers' money after spending £310,000 on entering another disastrous Eurovision Song Contest. 76-year-old veteran singer Engelbert Humperdinck opened the show in Baku, Azerbaijan on May 26, but gained a paltry 12 points and came in second last. The BBC admitted today the failure cost them the equivalent of £45,000 an hour or 2,130 TV licences at £145.50 a pop, according to data released under the Freedom of Information act. Out of 42 countries taking part, only Ireland, Latvia, Belgium and . Estonia awarded Humperdinck's Love Will Set You Free any points. Some critics are also shocked that the nations involved had to each pay hundreds of thousands to enter. 'The BBC paid £310,000 for the entry into the Eurovision Song Contest in 2012,' a corporation spokesman said. 'It is worth noting that as other broadcasters contribute to the Eurovision Song Contest the BBC is able to deliver a massive, live spectacle for a small fraction of the overall cost. 'The contest provides BBC viewers with over seven hours of programming across BBC One and BBC Three, making it extremely cost effective for a prime time entertainment programme.' The cash is not believed to include the thousands more the corporation spent on hotel and spending money for its staff, Humperdinck and his entourage. After Engelbert crashed to failure . humiliated music fans called on the BBC to pull out of the Eurovision . Song Contest after Britain's entry limped to a poor finish again. British viewers flooded the web with calls for the BBC to quit the contest. Romped home: Swedish entrant Loreen scored a phenomenal 372 points for her song Euphoria . TV presenter Philip Schofield led the charge, announcing on Twitter: 'It's time to pull out. 'Not even Robbie [Williams] could win it for us, it's too political.' Hundreds of viewers bombarded the BBC's Eurovision website, with many calling on the UK to withdraw from the 'biased' contest. One said: 'It doesn't matter who we have represent us things will always be the same and that's political PULL OUT AND DON'T BOTHER WASTING ANYMORE TIME OR MONEY!' Another said: 'Once again the voting has been political, when will we in the UK learn we are not liked and no matter what song or who sings it we will not get anywhere. 'It is time for the UK to pull out of this biased contest so we are not humiliated year after year.' Swedish singer Loreen won the title for the Scandinavian country with dance track Euphoria, which romped home with a landslide 372 points. Despite the low placing, Humperdinck insisted Eurovision was 'a wonderful experience'. He said afterwards: 'I want to thank everybody, especially my fans around the world for their words of support. I did the best for my country, the rest was out of my hands.'","The cash was the entry fee for Engelbert Humperdinck - who came second last in Baku, Azerbaijan in May ."

A woman who was unable to conceive naturally, has spoken out about the hardships of the adoption process. Jennifer Gilmore, who lives with her husband Pedro in Brooklyn, New York, describes that their quest for a child has left them emotionally and financially exhausted. After a string of failed pairings with birth mothers who picked other families or were discovered as frauds - playing the system for financial or emotional gain - Mrs Gilmore reveals that the biggest heartache came when they declined a newborn with Down's Syndrome. Keeping strong: Jennifer Gilmore (pictured with husband Pedro) has spoken out about the hardships of adoption . Mrs Gilmore, who has written a book based on her experiences titled The Mothers, contributed a first person article to the October issue of Vogue. The accomplished author was diagnosed with a form of inflammatory bowel disease in her twenties and was told after a number of surgeries that it was unlikely she would have children. Two years after getting married aged 35, the Gilmores started trying for a child, but after suffering a miscarriage and enduring five rounds of IVF they realised they would have to look for other options. Three years later they decided on domestic adoption, which meant they could raise the child from birth and the child would also have some knowledge of their birth mother. But after signing on and creating a profile with a national agency Mrs Gilmore describes that she and her husband were 'left open to heartache'. Mrs Gilmore has written a book based on her experiences . Giving a frank insight into the journey . that ensued in her magazine article, she states: 'We were blind to the . way open adoption leaves those who are unable to have children wide open . to heartache. 'When each relationship was cut, out lives unraveled. My husband and I grieved. We fought. We stopped trusting others and ourselves.' After two years navigating various stages of the adoption process the Gilmores still hadn't had any joy. As well as being turned down by birth mothers they were also alarmed to encounter women who had set up fake profiles which took advantage of those desperate for a baby. Mrs Gilmore writes: 'These are not birth mothers at all but women who are either exploiting those who will do anything for a child, for money, or, I would find, were after emotional support.' However after searching far and wide they found a suitable match in Missouri and started preparing for a new addition to their family. They had selected baby names, purchased items for the nursery and when they were told their little girl was two weeks early they boarded a plane and flew almost 1,000 miles to St Louis. Once there Mrs Gilmore describes that they were both 'overwhelmed' and spent time talking to the birth parents and thanking them before visiting their new daughter in intensive care. But once there they were informed that the newborn had a number of complications including an obstructed bowel, methadone withdrawal and a genetic disorder. Mrs Gilmore describes that while they became more open to options as time went on, special needs was never something they had never considered. It's estimated around 18,000 domestic adoptions take place every year in the U.S. Once inside the theater a nurse informed the couple that their adopted daughter had Down's Syndrome, and highlighted that a single line on the palm of her hand, instead of three, was an indication of the chromosomal condition. While Mrs Gilmore says that she has a friend who has a Down's Syndrome child, who is the 'light of her life', she and her husband were not 'equipped' for the undertaking. She adds: 'When we called out lawyer to tell her the news, she would assure us there would be another family for her... I did not think yet that our journey to have a family could - and would - continue.' Despite Mrs Gilmore's experience a 2011 Adoptive Families survey, found the majority of respondents were matched with a birth mother in less than three months, and 40 per cent were matched less than one month before their child was born. It's estimated around 18,000 domestic adoptions take place every year in the U.S,, each costing between $20,000 to $40,000.",Author Jennifer Gilmore speaks out about the adoption process in Vogue's October issue .

Honey Boo Boo's family has sparked shock once again after the child reality star's sister appears to have been pictured feeding a one-month-old baby Mountain Dew. New photographs show 12-year-old Lauryn Thompson, aka Pumpkin, apparently dipping a pacifier into a can of Mountain Dew, before allowing her newborn niece, Kaitlyn, to suckle on it. Of course, the soft drink is highly caffeinated, and can be dangerous for children to consume, let alone babies. Dangerous: 12-year-old Lauryn Thompson (in blue T-shirt), is seen dipping a pacifier into a can of Mountain Dew, before allowing the baby daughter of sister Anna 'Chickadee', 17, to suckle on it . The shocking images of the family, from . McIntyre, Georgia, the stars of Toddlers & Tiaras spin-off show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, were taken at the local Sparkle & Shine Pageant . this weekend, according to RadarOnline.com. Baby Kaitlyn is the daughter of Anna 'Chickadee', 17, the eldest sister of Honey Boo Boo, six, whose real name is Alana. Alana herself shot to fame early this year under similar controversial circumstances, after her mother, June Shannon, 30, was seen giving her a mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull on an episode of Toddlers & Tiaras. Ms Shannon, who was accused of 'doping' the child with high-sugar snacks and the caffeinated drink she called 'Go-Go- Juice', defended her actions saying: 'There are far worse things. I could be giving her alcohol.' Guilty look: Pumpkin dips the pacifier into the can of caffeinated drink as her sister cradles the baby . Caffeine hit: Pumpkin then allows the tiny infant to taste the sugary energy drink . But child health experts voiced . their concern about the so-called 'Go-Go Juice', given that a single can . of Mountain Dew or Red Bull contains as much caffeine as a cup of . coffee. A report last year from the American Academy of Pediatrics stated that children who have too much caffeine are at raised risk of neurological and . cardiovascular problems. Its . authors warned: 'Energy drinks are never appropriate for children or . adolescents. In general, caffeine-containing beverages, including soda, . should be avoided.' Child nutrition expert Melissa Halas-Liang told MailOnline that the first six months of life should be exclusively breast milk or . formula. Discussing today's photographs featuring Pumpkin feeding baby Kaitlyn Mountain Dew, she commented: 'I hope that the media attention that the Thompson family . receives over this incident can be used as teaching opportunity for the . family on what constitutes good health and nutrition practices. 'It . would be helpful for the family to ask questions about what and when . it's safe to introduce foods or liquids of any other kind outside of . breast milk or formula into their diet and the rationale behind it.' Controversy: The parents of pageant star Honey Boo Boo (front) were accused of child abuse according to new reports. June (behind the youngster) and Mike (to the right) and her three sisters, are shown . The new photographs of Pumpkin and baby Kaitlyn have been made public less . than a week after reports that the young pageant queen's parents were . accused of child abuse. The family was visited by the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services in March, according to The National Enquirer. A source told the magazine that  investigators were . called to the home as a result of Ms Shannon and Mike Thompson's unorthodox, . and highly-publicised, parenting methods which include feeding Alana . caffeinated drinks as well as roadkill for dinner.

Gil and Kelly Bates of Lake City, Tennessee, have spoken in detail about the complications that came with the birth of their 19th child Jeb Colton Bates. The super-sized Christian family, who recently received their own reality TV series United Bates Of America, have revealed that Jeb struggled to breathe on his own when he was born in February. The tiny tot, who is now healthy and appears in the TLC series as it premieres tonight, was sent to an Intensive Care Unit not long after he was born premature by two weeks. Scroll down for video . Precious: The Bates family, who boast 19 children, have revealed the complications of their youngest's birth . Frightened: Gil (right), the father, Kelly (middle), the mother, and one of their daughters feared for the baby's life . The family, who are the best friends of the infamous Duggar clan who have 19 children of their own, are seen in tears in a new teaser clip for an upcoming episode of the series. Gil, the father, tells the camera: 'He [Jeb] was kind of blue like every baby that comes out kind of blue... but I noticed he wasn't crying. It set off a red flag in my heart.' One of the his daughters, Tori, then says, 'He had a hard time breathing' before her sister, Erin, says: 'We  thought that it was just normal because babies normally, it takes them a minute to get their breath and cry or something'. Their father then explains what had in fact occurred which resulted in Jeb being transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Tiny: The baby, seen above, was born two weeks premature and was transferred to Intensive Care quickly . He says: 'Basically, he'd come through the canal so fast that he . didn't really get everything squeezed out of him, like fluids, and so his . body obtained a lot of that and had not been able to dissipate it.' He explains further that his son had air trapped outside of the lungs, in the chest cavity. Fortunately, doctors were able to nurse Jeb, who weighed a healthy 7lbs 8oz, back to health after several days. Kelly, 45, further explains how she had simply gone into the doctor's office that day for a routine check up. 'They sent me straight to the hospital,' she says. 'The delivery was kind of an unexpected rush.' The Bates roll call now stands at: . Zach, . Michaella, Erin, Lawson, Nathan, Alyssa, Tori, Trace, Carlin, Josie, . Katie, Jackson, Warden, Isaiah, Addallee, Ellie, Callie, Judson and Jeb. Supersized: The 21-member Bates family of Tennessee, pictured, were given a reality show by TLC. The show, which premieres tonight on the network, will follow Jeb's arrival as well as the other children . Birthday: Jeb Colton Bates (middle) was Kelly and Gil's nineteenth baby. The evangelical Christians said that the boy's name means 'beloved friend of God from Coal Town' According to the evangelical Christians, Jeb's name means 'beloved friend of God from Coal Town'. The network said in a press statement . about the new series that each 30-minute episode will focus on 'a new . adventure with the Bates family as they manage everyday life... and the . inevitable chaos that ensues with 10 girls and 9 boys running around . under one roof'. In an earlier teaser clip, the family are seen welcoming Jeb into the family home. One of the young girls tells the camera: 'When Jeb got home, it was just like a family reunion'. One of the smallest, and most adorable, children exclaims: 'He's so tiny!' The . clip also shows how important Valentine's Day is to the family, who are . seen treated to a special dinner with waiter service. New addition: Jeb's arrival took the family's size to 21 and became one of the largest in America. Their rival is the Duggar family, who have their own reality TV show and, of course, are best friends with the Bates . Big sister: The Bates' third oldest child, Erin (pictured), is a musician and, according to the family blog, 'a devoted organizer [who] helps us maintain order' The mother has had no twins, no C-sections and 14 drug-free births and has spent more of her adult life pregnant than not. Despite making the faith-led decision to avoid contraception, in keeping with their evangelical beliefs, the family have not been entirely without controversy. Gil and Kelly see no contradiction in wanting medical help to add to their already enormous family - but not to limit its size. They have been at the receiving end of criticism for failing to secure health insurance for their 11 youngest children. It was never the Bates' intention to produce a family that, according to 2010 Census data, is over seven times larger than the average Tennessee household size, they told ABC last year. 'We both came to the conclusion that we just want to trust God with how many children we have. We never really thought we'd have 18. We thought we'd have maybe one or two - maybe three,' said Gil, a 45-year-old tree surgeon. The Bates family does everything on a grand scale. Their 4,000-square-feet home in Lake City, Tennessee, has five enormous bedrooms. The family's laundry has five washers . and three driers and rails of clothes that stretch the length of the . loft room, holding hundreds and hundreds of shirts, pants and T-shirts - . not to mention an eye-wateringly large mountain of underwear and socks.","The Bates, from Lake City, Tennessee, have 19 children in total after Jeb Colton Bates was born in February, 2012 .

Police were called to a Texas highway early on Sunday morning because concerned citizens saw a young boy riding his bike alongside cars and trucks. They then discovered that the boy was running away from a very dysfunctional home. The seven-year-old boy, whose name has not been released, eventually told police where he lived and they escorted him back to his home where they spoke with his mother, Tamara Ruth Whitt, and her father, Edgar Dale Whitt. Not only were they allegedly abusive to the boy and his two siblings, but they were also believed to be involved in an incestuous relationship with each other. Father and daughter: Edgar Dale Whitt, left, is the father of Tamara, right, and he also allegedly fathered a child with Tamara . During their talk with the responding officers, the Whitts said that the seven-year-old, along with his five-year-old and two-year-old siblings, had all been in straitjackets. ‘They didn’t know how he got out,’ the police report states. A continued investigation into the family suggested that Edgar, 54, and Tamara, 26, had a sexual relationship and were the parents of the two-year-old boy found in the Howard County home. Sheriff Stan Parker confirmed to MailOnline that while Tamara was the mother of all three children, Edgar was the father of only the 2-year-old. ‘I've really never seen anything like this before in Howard County,’ Mr Parker said.

"By . James Chapman . UPDATED: . 10:41 EST, 22 October 2011 . Her rapid rise to become the youngest minister in  government has taken some colleagues by surprise. Now extraordinary claims are circulating at Westminster that Chloe Smith was appointed because David Cameron was confused about her credentials. Miss Smith, who became the youngest MP in Parliament when she won the Norwich North by-election in 2009, was promoted last weekend to become Economic Secretary to the Treasury in the mini reshuffle that followed Liam Fox’s resignation. Rise: Miss Chloe Smith with Prime Minister David Cameron, who appears to have been confused about her credentials . At the age of 29 years, four months and 27 days, she became the youngest minister in government, marking an unparalleled ascent to the political frontline. However, according to an account of the phone call giving her the good news, the Prime Minister was under the misapprehension that she had been a chartered accountant and would therefore be well suited to the post. After Mr Cameron told Miss Smith he would like to offer her the post, she is said to have replied: ‘Well, thank you Prime Minister. . .It would be an honour, but the Treasury…it’s a little daunting…’ The Prime Minister allegedly responded: ‘Not daunting surely for someone who was a chartered accountant?’ The confusion may have arisen because the MP, an English literature graduate, worked for accountancy firm Deloitte before entering politics, but as a consultant not an accountant . The Norwich North MP is then said to have admitted: ‘Er, well, actually Prime Minister, I wasn’t an accountant. I was a management consultant in an accountancy firm.’ Mr Cameron apparently then said ‘never mind’ and welcomed Miss Smith aboard. The confusion may have arisen because the MP, an English literature graduate, worked for accountancy firm Deloitte before entering politics, but as a consultant not an accountant. At the age of 29, Chloe became the youngest minister in government . Miss Smith’s promotion has delighted her friends – including Chancellor George Osborne – but angered some older MPs. One male minister described Miss Smith’s appointment as a ‘gimmick’ that was too obviously made in response to Ed Miliband’s recent Shadow Cabinet reshuffle, which saw a clutch of young female Labour MPs promoted. ‘I’m afraid this shows the shallowness with which Number Ten makes appointments,’ the minister said. ‘The intake that has been at this for 15 or 20 years has held the party together. 'These are people who actually have quite a lot of experience and David will find that he can’t keep on passing them over.’ Miss Smith admitted she was ‘surprised’ to be elevated to the Government. But she added: ‘I am also very happy and very proud. 'It feels quick to me but I’m pleased to have the Prime Minister’s confidence.’ And her allies brushed aside criticism of her appointment as jealousy. Elizabeth . Truss, Tory MP for South West Norfolk, said: ‘She’s very competent, . very trustworthy  and very energetic and I think it’s  a great . opportunity for her and for the Treasury.’ Miss Smith unexpectedly won her seat in the 2009 by-election with a majority of more than 7,000, after popular Labour MP Dr Ian Gibson quit Parliament, and held it at last year’s general election.",Chloe Smith was actually a management consultant at accountancy firm Deloitte .

'Someone had changed her Facebook . status and it was saying nasty things about her - things that weren't . true. 'She was upset because it was saying things about her sleeping . around - it was all untrue. I was trying to contact Facebook.' 24-year-old Leanne McNuff was taken to hospital on Sunday night with stab wounds where she was pronounced dead a short time later . Emma said she discovered her friend, a former call centre worker, had been knifed to death on the radio news. She added: 'Later I heard about her death on the radio. They hadn't named her, it just said a young girl had been stabbed. 'My stomach just jumped when I . Googled it and I started screaming. I was texting and ringing Leanne but . got no reply so I feared the worst.' After the knife attack Leanne's mother Margaret and brother Ryan who live next door dashed round to the house to find the young woman dying. Emma said: 'I just feel desperately sad and devastated for Jaden. He was great with my little one. He was Leanne's world and she was his. It's unbearable.' Leanne’s mother paid . tribute to her daughter in a statement she released through the police. She said: 'Leanne was loved by everyone and was . an honest and upfront young woman. We are all just devastated. We feel . numb and empty. 'Leanne was a beautiful, kind-hearted and generous girl, who lived and . breathed for her four-year-old son Jaden, who in turn idolised and . adored his mummy. 'Leanne had a great sense of humour, with lovely manners, and was loved by everyone who knew her.' Leanne and Pte Lowe, 24, spoke to . local media in February 2008 when the soldier returned from a tour of . Iraq to see his son Jaden for the first time. Police attend the crime scene, in Droylsden, Greater Manchester where the 24-year-old soldier has been arrested on suspicion of murder . He told how he had been worrying about Leanne, who gave birth just 10 days after he was sent to Basra. He said at the time: 'Although I had been sent photos, I was just amazed when I saw him for the first time. 'It . was wonderful to see him. I was worrying about Jaden and Leanne but my . mates knew what I was going through and were very supportive.' But it is understood the relationship had been strained in recent years and the couple had broken up on at least one occasion. A . family friend said: 'They broke up but then Ian managed to talk her . round again.' Leanne was found just after 7.45pm on Sunday. Paramedics . tried to save her at the house and she was rushed to hospital. A post mortem examination had revealed that she died from multiple stab wounds. Yesterday, friends and family left floral tributes outside the family home. Leanne’s aunt Teresa McCarthy told how Leanne had been a successful dancer as a teenager and had even won awards. Floral tributes have already been placed outside the young mother's home . She said: 'She was such a lovely girl. She looked after her son very well and she had a good job before she became pregnant. 'She was full of life, intelligent, bubbly and very pretty. As a mother . she doted on her little boy - it was the making of her. She comes from a . good family who supported her. 'We feel robbed and angry. As a family we are just devastated - what a . waste of life. Nobody deserves to die at 24. My sister is going through . hell.' A former pupil of Fairfield high school in Droylsden and Tameside . College, Leanne had worked at ATA security before becoming a mother. Detective Inspector Graham Brock from Greater Manchester Police said: 'Our thoughts are with Leanne's family and friends at this time, who are understandably distraught that their loved one has been taken from them in this way. 'We are in the early stages of the investigation and are working to establish the full circumstances of what has happened. 'I would like to reassure residents that we do not believe there is any danger to the wider community, as we believe this is an isolated incident. We would urge anyone who may have seen or heard anything to contact us.' Leanne's friend said she had been planning to move to Catterick, north Yorkshire, to be near Lowe, who was stationed at the garrison there with his battalion. Soldiers who are stationed in the UK live in barracks during the week and are free to leave at weekends unless they are on duty.

The family of a cancer-stricken little girl pleaded for help today after they faced the dawning reality that she could die stranded in Mexico. Olivia Downie flew to the city of Tijuana earlier this month to undergo specialist treatment, but unlike others, the bed-ridden seven-year-old has not responded successfully. She is unlikely to survive now that the cancer has spread to her lungs and brain, but doctors have refused permission for her to fly home to Fraserburgh, Scotland, without medical support. And the family are now battling to raise the £140,000 they need to fly her back home in a special private jet. Sick: Olivia Downie has not responded well to treatment and her family need £140,000 to fly her home . Because of her worsening condition, . Olivia requires specialist equipment to keep her alive and only a . private jet has the space and facilities to cater for her needs. With . the charter from Tijuana to Aberdeen Airport costing £137,196, plus . another £1,643 to fly a medic overseas, the family are desperate to find . ways to raise the cash. Speaking from Tijuana, Olivia’s mother Lauren said: 'We want her to be surrounded by friends and family that love her, not strangers. 'She was in quite a bad condition when we came but now she’s critical. The charity that we’re involved with is already having to fork out money that we don’t have. 'Any support we can get to help her back . home would be a massive help. I am hoping for a miracle where we can . take her home and have her for a little while. Support: Olivia with father Steven receiving treatment. Her family want to leave Mexico and be at home . 'My best case scenario is to get home, so that if she was going to die she could be surrounded by her family and friends.' Tragic: Olivia before she was first diagnosed with cancer in 2009. Her family have previously flown her to Germany for treatment . Olivia was diagnosed with stage four Neuroblastoma three years ago and the family have previously flown to Germany so she can receive immunotherapy. Earlier this month she flew out to the Hope 4 Cancer Institute in Mexico to try photodynamic therapy. But, Olivia, who is big sister to Jessica, 22 months, has been one of the few patients not to respond to a special injection to make the tumours easier to break down. Heartbroken Lauren said: 'She had the injection. We knew it would make her worse and then make her better. 'It’s made her worse, but she never seemed to get better. All the other people who have had the injection have been getting better after two or three days. 'Now she can’t even hear me. I was trying to tell her that I love her, but she couldn’t. 'I was holding her hand and telling her to squeeze if she could hear me, but she didn’t even move. 'I am hoping for a miracle. I want her at home, surrounded by people that love her.' Lauren, who is 25 weeks pregnant, also fears Olivia might not live long enough to see her sibling. She said: 'It’s always in the back of my mind that we might have a chance of losing Olivia before I have this baby. 'It makes me cry. It makes me think why is she like this and so unwell. Olivia is just in absolute agony - but doesn’t ever complain. She’s always putting everyone else first.

A police chief under investigation for allegedly making lewd remarks to female staff was found hanged after saying his force had made him a ‘pariah’, an inquest heard. Deputy chief constable David Ainsworth was removed from his duties after up to 24 complaints were made against him. Among the allegations were claims that the £110,000-a-year officer at Wiltshire Police had leered at a woman in an tailored blouse before commenting: ‘Nice buttons.’ Mr Ainsworth denied the accusations and wanted to ‘clear his name’, but he felt ‘abandoned’ by his force and ‘uncomfortable going out’, the inquest heard. His body was found in the garage of the cottage he shared with girlfriend Joanna Howes in Potterne, near Devizes. The father-of-four left Kent Constabulary, where he had served for 22 years, and joined the Wiltshire force in 2008 following the breakdown of his marriage to wife Emma. Known for his sharp intellect, Mr Ainsworth’s ‘ultimate goal’ was to become a chief constable, Trowbridge Coroner’s Court heard yesterday. The 49-year-old had been shortlisted for the position at Bedfordshire Police. But Miss Howes said he was upset at being forced to withdraw in September 2010 after he was told about the allegations. He was removed from front-line duties by Wiltshire’s then chief constable Brian Moore, now head of UK Border Force, and put on secondment winding down the disbanded Forensic Science Service. He became depressed and sought treatment in January 2011. Miss Howes sobbed as she told how she found his body on March 22 last year. ‘He felt abandoned by a police service he devoted his life to,’ she added. Tragic: David Ainsworth was found at his home in Potterne, Wilts., by girlfriend Jo Howes . ‘He felt under scrutiny and made into a pariah. He felt ostracised from his organisation and he felt uncomfortable going out. ‘He wasn’t the same David. He was shocked by the pettiness of some of the [allegations] that were included. ‘David told me senior colleagues had told him it was a witch-hunt. Mrs Ainsworth, who lives in Coxheath, . near Maidstone, Kent, with the couple’s three teenage daughters and . 13-year-old son, said her estranged husband had ‘become a shell of his . former self’ during the investigation, which was carried out by officers . from South Wales Police. Describing his visits in the weeks . before his death, she said: ‘The children were visibly shocked. They . didn’t know what to say to him. He looked physically ill. He looked like . he should be in hospital.’ Wiltshire Police’s director of . resources, Matthew Bennion-Pedley, said Mr Ainsworth was popular with . many of his colleagues. ‘He said he wanted to clear his name,’ he added. ‘He was concerned and aghast by the nature of the allegations.’ The three-day hearing continues.

A computer hacker illegally acquired enough credit and debit card details to carry out a potential £800,000 worth of fraud. Edward Pearson, 23, of Lendale, York, used a trojan virus to download thousands of credit card details along with the postcodes, passwords, names and dates of birth of more than eight million people in the UK. One of his programs scanned through 200,000 accounts registered to online payment service PayPal - identifying names, passwords and current balances. Pearson, an 'incredibly talented' boarding school student who carried out the crime for an ‘intellectual . challenge’, has been jailed for two years and two months. Fraudster: Edward Pearson, 23, stole the personal details of more than eight million people. Pearson's girlfriend Cassandra Mennim, 21, tried to pay for luxury hotels using stolen credit card details . He also managed to shut down part of the mobile phone giant Nokia’s internal network for two weeks after hacking in and copying the details of over 8,000 members of staff, Southwark Crown Court heard. His 21-year-old girlfriend, Cassandra Mennim, a sociology student at the University of York, triggered a police inquiry after she tried to pay for luxury hotel stays using stolen credit card details. Pearson was arrested after investigators linked a web alias, ‘G-Zero’, which had appeared on hacking forums, to his personal email address. On one of his computers officers found 8,110,474 names, dates of birth, and postcodes for adults living in the UK. Police officers in the case said that if the details were printed onto double-sided A4 it would fill a staggering 67,500 sheets. David Hughes, prosecuting, said the hacker had carried out a series of ‘sophisticated, planned frauds.' He said: ‘Pearson used his considerable expertise for his criminal intentions. ‘When police examined other computers they found the details of 2,701 credit or debit cards. ‘Based on the average fraud used on a single card being £309, the potential gain to be made by him was £834,000. ‘In fact the actual fraud on these . credit and debit cards attributed to Pearson amounted to £2,351, but the . total on the cards was £39,832.’ The details were all stolen over an 18-month period between January 1, 2010, and August 30, 2011. Pearson coded trojan viruses, called Zeus, SpyEye and Python, to automatically scour the internet in search of personal details. His Python program successfully downloaded the details of 200,000 PayPal accounts. Mr . Hughes added that Pearson had hacked into the systems of Nokia and web . giant AOL to gain access to their employees’ details, as well as other . sensitive information. ‘This . had a significant negative impact on the company, which had to shut its . networks down for two weeks while checks were carried out on it,’ he . said. Mennim was caught after booking rooms . at the Cedar Court Grand Hotel and Lady Anne Middleton Hotel, both in . York, using stolen credit card details and PayPal accounts. Andrew Bodnar, defending Pearson, said his hacking had not been for financial gain, but more as an intellectual challenge. ‘This . is a young man who has very advance computer skills, but has put them . to the wrong use, but he is not the criminal mastermind that everyone . claims he is. ‘The total amount of money he fraudulently amounted, is the figure of £2,351.

"By . Bob Graham . PUBLISHED: . 17:01 EST, 14 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:01 EST, 14 June 2012 . A Texan tycoon who defrauded almost £5 billion from investors and used his wealth to bankroll international cricket matches in England was jailed for 110 years yesterday. Allen Stanford, who for 22 years ran investment scams with an estimated 17,000 victims, was once one of the richest men in America, worth more than £1.2 billion. The courtroom in Houston was packed with many of his victims to hear the sentence handed down, the majority of whom were small business owners. Two of the estimated 17,000 victims of Stanford’s fraud were allowed to address the court. Jailbird: Convicted financier Allen Stanford arrives at Federal Court in Houston for sentencing . Jaime Escalona, who represented Latin . American victims, addressed the hearing before turning to stare directly . at Stanford to tell him: 'You, sir, are a dirty, rotten, scoundrel.' The other victims’ spokesman, Angela . Shaw, of the Stanford Victims Coalition, said of the fraudster: “Allen . Stanford has stolen more than billions of dollars. He took our lives as . we knew them.” She said some 28,000 people had lost money in the scam. Yet, even in his final hour of shame . the former tycoon couldn’t help but deny it all and to blame others. 'I’m not a thief.....I did not defraud anybody,' he said. 'The US government are responsible . ruining the business....they destroyed it and turned it to nothing. Stanford was a real brick-and-mortar global financial empire.' Guilty: Stanford was convicted in March of 13 of 14 counts of fraud . Stanford now plans to appeal against the conviction and sentence even though he was officially declared “indigent” – penniless. The court has now to appoint lawyers . who will be funded out of a scheme similar to Britain’s own legal-aid . and it is estimated to run into tens of millions of dollars. During yesterday’s sentencing, . Stanford’s 40-minute rambling account was the first time he had actually . spoken to the court about what had taken place during the 22-years his . banking empire existed. He claimed he was a scapegoat and . blamed the federal government and a court-appointed receiver who took . over his companies in 2009 for tearing down his business empire and . preventing his investors from getting any of their money back. He said: “ I’m not here to ask for . sympathy or forgiveness or to throw myself at your mercy but I will tell . you I did not run a Ponzi scheme. I didn’t defraud anybody.” Stanford was once considered one of . the richest men in the U.S., with an estimated personal net worth of . more than £1.2billion. His financial empire stretched from the U.S. to . Latin America and the Caribbean. Calling Stanford arrogant and without . remorse, prosecutors said he used the money from investors who bought . certificates of deposit, or CDs, from his bank in Antigua to fund a . string of failed businesses, bribe regulators and pay for a lavish . lifestyle that included yachts, a fleet of private jets and sponsorship . of cricket tournaments. Stanford added moments before being . led away: “If I live the rest of my life in prison …. I will always be . at peace with the way I conducted myself in business.” Disgraced tycoon Stanford’s schemes . were the second largest in US financial history – second only to Bernie . Madoff, the so-called ‘King of Con’ - who was given 150 years for his . £11.2-billion Ponzi scheme. The majority of the victims were small businesses or private investors, looking to cash-in on interest rates above bank rate. Cricket fan: The then Sir Allen Stanford poses with the England team during the Stanford 2020 Super Series match between England and Middlesex in 2008. He was later stripped of his knighthood . Cheeky: During the 2008 Stanford Super Series, the financier was photographed bouncing the wife of English cricket player Matt Prior on his knee . Happier times: Allen Stanford poses with Stanford Superstars following their victory at the end of the Stanford 20/20 Super Series match between England and Stanford Superstars in 2008 . Mike Bishop, of Houston, Texas, who . lost round £900,000 said outside the court: “ This was a wholesale . failure by government agencies who regulate companies such as Stanford. They are as responsible. “Here in Texas we believe in capital . punishment but I would not wish it on Stanford, I want him to wake up . every morning in his prison cell and reflect on what he did to us all.” Stanford, ever the showman, entered the courtroom dressed in green prison fatigues and grinning all over his face. When handcuffs were taken off he waved . to his elderly mother Sammie Stanford who sat in the well of the court . alongside Stanford’s daughter Randi. Prosecutors had asked the court for a . sentence of 230 years in prison. The prosecutor told Judge David . Hittner: “ 230 years will not get anyone their money back but on . sleepless nights they will know that he got the maximum.” In June 2008 Stanford signed a . controversial deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for a . series of five Twenty20 cricket games between England and a Caribbean . side nicknamed the ‘Stanford All-Stars.’ The winners would collect a . prize-fund of £13.6-million and the losers would get nothing.

His next trick was to fly into Lords . aboard a personalised helicopter laden with treasure chests of cash. He . planned to be the saviour of English cricket, even though he admitted he . never really understood the game. By the time of his arrest, in February . 2009, the ECB has severed all ties with Stanford and his honorary . knighthood provided by the government of Antigua had been stripped.

A hapless armed robber was such a regular at the betting shop he tried to hold up that staff thought he was joking and asked him: 'Liam, what are you doing?' The Ladbrokes cashiers initially thought Liam Darby was playing a prank when he stormed into their shop with a rock and demanded money, a court heard. But when assistant Wayne Newman realised he was serious he handed over £1,600 - most of which Darby dropped on the way out. Just minutes before he'd tried to rob the nearby Co-op supermarket where staff just ignored him and told him to go away. The 20-year-old raider was a regular punter on the gambling machines in the betting shop, in Gosport, Hampshire. And he was even easier to recognise than most customers because he has distinctive shaved eyebrows and a tattoo on his neck. His own barrister, Barry McElduff, even described his actions as 'idiotic', at Portsmouth Crown Court. He . said: 'One can scarcely think of a robbery of a shop that was more . likely to come undone than Mr Darby’s behaviour in his local Ladbrokes. 'This . is a place that he regularly goes into and a place that when he . approached the counter the staff thought he was joking to begin with . because they know him so well.' He added: 'Having been given the money by the employee, Mr Darby is so drunk he is dropping the money as he leaves the store.' Regular: Darby was a regular at this betting shop Ladbrokes in Forton Road, Gosport where staff knew him . The baffled shop assistant told him: 'What are you doing, you come in here all the time, you’re on CCTV.' But Darby, from Gosport, was determined to get his hands on some cash. Minutes before the raid on Ladbrokes, he had gone into a nearby Co-op supermarket where he botched another robbery. Botched: Before the raid on Ladbrokes Darby tried to rob the Co-op (pictured) nearby where he used a can to threaten staff as he was determined to get his hands on some cash . There, he had used a can to threaten staff but they ignored his demands for cash and told him to get out. As he left the Co-op he threatened a customer who also refused to hand his money over, telling Darby to 'just walk away'. The father-of-one was arrested four days later on March 12. Darby, who has previous convictions for theft and assault, pleaded guilty to robbery and attempted robbery. Mr McElduff added: 'They were drunken, idiotic, spur-of-the-moment offences for which Mr Darby hangs his head in shame.' CCTV: Darby is pictured during the first robbery in the Co-op where staff ignored him and told him to leave . The court heard Darby had been given a number of community orders which he had breached.

After the wettest June on record, another deluge is on the way, with at least a month's worth of rain set to fall today and tomorrow across much of Britain. The Met Office last night issued a severe weather warning, predicting 'heavy thundery downpours' and up to four inches of rain by the weekend – more than the average for the whole of July. Play continues at Wimbledon as threatening grey clouds hover over head . Despite the sight of some blue sky wet weather delayed the start of the One Day International between England and Australia at Edgbaston today . Rollers were used to try and drain the water from the field of play, but there were still heavy puddles in the outfield for the match at Edgbaston . Well if you're going to get wet anyway... One sport that won't be stopped by the rain is surfing. This picture shows the grey skies along the shoreline at St Agnes, Cornwall . Yet despite the seemingly endless wet weather, four water companies still have a hosepipe ban in force, brought in at the start of April. South East Water said restrictions would stay in place until autumn at least, while Sutton and East Surrey Water, Veolia Central and Veolia Southeast are also clinging on, saying underwater aquifers are still not fully recharged. The drought declared at the start of the year now seems a distant memory. Northern and eastern England and Scotland will see the worst of the rain today, but it is set to extend to central and southern areas tomorrow, threatening men's semi-final day at Wimbledon. The wet weather will continue in northern England on Saturday, but Sunday should be much drier. Brollies . ready! Spectators brave the elements during the quarter-final matches . at a rainy Wimbledon today as it emerged torrential rain and slow-moving . storms will soak the UK over the next two days . The Met Office and Environment Agency warned of more surface and river flooding, giving no respite to the families in risk areas already hit by last month's downpours. Temperatures over the next few days will hover around the average, reaching highs of 23C (73F) during the day. Heavy rain started falling again yesterday afternoon and there will be patchy downpours today, but tomorrow is set to see the worst of it, with torrential rain and some storms. It has been the wettest April-to-June period on record. Wales and northern England have suffered from flooding, while the downpours have affected summer events including the Diamond Jubilee, Henley Regatta and Wimbledon. In Wiltshire, strawberry farmers say their crop is in danger of rotting in waterlogged fields, and they hope to sell most of their stock as early as mid-July. Warnings: The Met Office has issued warnings for . much of Britain, including London, East Anglia, Devon and Cornwall, the . north of England and Scotland, while on Friday,  the north east . especially should be prepared . Unsettled outlook: Three-day weather forecast maps for the UK for (l-r) today, tomorrow, and Friday . Forecasters have blamed movements of the jet stream – the high altitude wind which sweeps from west to east – for the unseasonable weather. They say it has become 'blocked' by high pressure, causing a long-running heatwave on the east coast of America and non-stop rain and wind this side of the Atlantic. The average rainfall during a normal July is 70mm, nearly three inches. Up to 100mm – almost four inches – is set to fall today and tomorrow. Met Office chief forecaster Martin Young said: 'We are expecting outbreaks of heavy rain across a wide area of the UK, with worst affected spots likely to be in central and northern parts of the country. 'This is likely to lead to surface water flooding. The public should be prepared for disruption to travel and outdoor activities.' Downpour: Visitors to the Cotswold Show yesterday in Gloucester had to put up with the unseasonal conditions for June . Beachwear: Never mind sun hats and bikinis, essential clothing for a seaside break in the UK are waterproof jackets and a good, sturdy brolly . Waiting for the summer: This ice cream business, on the Exmouth seafront in Devon, remains closed during the wet and cold weather . But he added the rain would be patchy, with some areas seeing none at all. A good proportion of the country may also have some sunshine today. An Environment Agency spokesman said: 'Heavy rain on Friday and Saturday may lead to significant flooding of properties across parts of northern England. 'We urge people to remain vigilant and prepared for flooding by checking the Environment Agency website and signing up for localised river flood warnings.' Last month was the wettest June since records began in 1910. Provisional Met Office figures showed the UK had 145.3mm (5¾ inches), beating the previous record of 136.2mm (5¼ inches) in June 2007. If the weeks of torrential rain were not . bad enough, homeowners have a new problem to contend with - rats. Experts . say scores of rat communities have been displaced by the recent flash . floods and they are looking for shelter - in your home. The . water-deluged drains and sewers of the past few weeks have mobilised . rat populations previously living underground, driving them above the . flood waters and in some cases through cracked drains and into homes, according to drainage specialists Drain Claim. The . insurance handling company believes the nation’s booming rat population – . currently at 80 million – will continue to rise. The . combination of flash flooding, an ageing sewer system, councils cutting . back on services including pest control and weekly bin collections and . insurers failing to adequately repair damaged drains, is creating the . perfect breeding ground for rats in residential areas. David Hayes, CEO of Drain Claim, . said: 'One of the biggest issues we are . currently seeing is rats who have been moved around by the flood waters . finding their way through cracked pipe work and into properties. 'Home owners in the South East, Midlands and North East have . already reported a surge in rat problems and unfortunately this is . likely to continue as the flood waters subside.' Resilient rats are capable of swimming up to . half a mile, even against the current, in a sewer pipe. And young rodents can squeeze through holes . as small as one centimetre wide and capable of creating significant damage by . chewing through pipe work and building materials. Rats are also extremely difficult to eradicate once . they have established a nest, with females capable of producing . litters of up to 10, 10 times a year. Mr Hayes added: 'Once rats enter a . home, because of the serious health risks that they pose, the only . course of action is trapping or poisoning which runs the risk of . decaying and infected bodies being trapped within the fabric of a . property. 'It is far better to address the . problem outside of the property by preventing rats from establishing a . location within the sewage system and working their way into the home. 'I would urge property owners . affected by the recent floods, even if they haven’t noticed any visible . sign of rats, to get their drains checked and ensure they have adequate . protection for their drainage systems through their buildings insurance . policy’s accidental damage clauses.'","More than 2.4ins of rain expected to fall in 36 hours in much of eastern, central and northern Britain .

Excuses, rants, arguments  and even being pelted with the odd water balloon are all occupational hazards. But this traffic warden paid a high price for simply doing her job when one disgruntled driver apparently took things much further. Melissa Spencer, 39, was allegedly knocked over by a motorist in a dispute over a parking ticket. Witnesses claimed there had been a row between the warden and the driver of a Green Flag recovery van shortly before she was injured. Paramedics treated Miss Spencer at the roadside following the incident in Southport, Merseyside, on Thursday morning. Mother-of-two Paula Liddiard, 39, who lives nearby, said: ‘She was on the floor and moving, the driver was pacing up and down the road.’ Miss Spencer was put in a neck brace and on to a stretcher before being taken to Southport District Hospital with minor injuries. The driver was arrested and taken away for questioning. Neighbours said traffic wardens patrolled the street twice an hour and even worked on Sundays to catch motorists illegally parking on double yellow lines and in residents-only parking bays. One said: ‘I’ve even had a ticket myself outside my own home when my parking permit ran out. But I don’t agree with trying to knock the warden down, that’s going too far. They are just doing their job.’ Last night David Eyre, 44, was charged with driving without due care and attention. A spokesman for Merseyside Police said he was due to appear at South Sefton Magistrates’ Court next month. It is the second time that Miss Spencer has been injured on the job. Two years ago, she was dragged down a street after another driver trapped her arm in their window. Aftermath: Miss Spencer is treated by paramedics as concerned passers-by gather around her . The number of traffic wardens in Britain fell last year, but despite this there was an increase in the number of tickets given out. A parking fine is handed out every five seconds, with 6.8million issued in 2011, according to information from 71 city councils. That is a quarter of million more than in the previous year and equates to at least £234million in revenue. Figures released under a Freedom of Information request last year revealed that, since 2006, there have been 24 incidents in which wardens were deliberately hit by drivers, and another four where they were hit by car doors. Others have been pelted with eggs, snowballs, paint and water balloons in revenge for handing out tickets. In February, Diquyen Trinh, 39, of Stockport, was fined £1,590 and had his licence endorsed with eight points after deliberately driving at a traffic warden, knocking him to the ground, in Crewe, Cheshire. The officer suffered a broken wrist and shoulder injuries. A spokesman for Green Flag  said of the incident involving  Miss Spencer: ‘We take any road  incident involving our recovery operators seriously. However, as this incident is currently under police investigation we are unable to comment any further.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Allegedly knocked over by van after argument with driver this morning .

A woman tried to hang herself in a magistrates court building by leaping from a 30ft balcony - but was saved by fellow defendants awaiting a separate case. The 37-year-old tied a rope round her neck and attached it to a balcony before climbing over to jump as lawyers and staff looked on in horror. But two defendants in another case rushed to save her and grabbed hold of her T-shirt, splitting it in half. Croydon Magistrates' Court, where a woman tried to hang hersel by leaping from a 30ft balcony . As Shan Shan Su, 40, lost her grip on her clothing her partner Derek Hoilett, 48, grabbed hold of her arms but eventually the woman slipped from their grip. But by this time security guards had gathered underneath and they caught her, foiling the apparent suicide attempt. She had been in court for a committal hearing to the crown court on charges of false imprisonment of Christopher Bamber at her home in Sutton, Surrey, and wasting police time. Sources say the woman must have smuggled the rope into Croydon Magistrates' Court, south London, despite security bag searches on entry. The balcony she leapt from is in the court building complex leading to the courts themselves. A tearful Ms Su said: 'This morning the lady she had whiskers drawn on her face with black pen. 'We saw her coming up the stairs and she went into the toilet and I said to my partner ""This girl here is different"". She was very quiet that is all I know. 'She had a rope and my partner and I . were stood along the balcony from her then I saw her tying a rope to the . balcony and start to put her leg over. 'I ran over and I grabbed hold of her by her t-shirt. I held her and I held her and the top spilt.' 'Of the two people who were trying to . hold her the female was the main one. She did her level best and also . you could see it in her face how upset she was when she couldn’t hold on . to her anymore.' Barrister Steven Attridge . Ms Su had burn marks on her hands from where she desperately tried to cling to the woman. Mr Hoilett followed his wife to help. He said: 'Then I managed to grab hold of her arms but she slipped. Just before she did the security guards had come and stood beneath her an grabbed her legs. 'She didn’t tie it properly and the rope, which was synthetic and quite thin, snapped as she went down. The rope was long, too long I think.' Ms Su, said: 'I couldn’t hold on, but if I hadn’t managed to save her then I would have felt so guilty, I could not have lived with myself. Because we held her it gave them time to come round.' Ms Su and her partner are due to be sentenced later today for common assault later today. Barrister Steven Attridge witnessed the shocking events shortly after 10am this morning. He said: 'We were standing literally underneath when we heard a commotion, we heard a noise from the balcony and looked up and saw an Asian female and a black man run to the end of the balcony. 'It was at this point we saw the woman climbing over. At this point the couple, predominantly the female, grabbed hold of her, both her arms and clothes as she tried to lower herself down from the balcony. 'Now they both held on to her for as long as they could for what seemed like 10 or 15 seconds by which time the security guards had been alerted to what was going on, a number of security guards had run underneath her by the time the couple either decided to let her go or couldn’t hold on to her anymore. 'She fell into the arms of at least two security guards who brought her down as gently as they could at which point I realised she had a yellow rope tied tightly around her neck and the balcony edge, I couldn’t see if it had snapped. 'When she was brought down a number of police officers became involved and one of the first things I saw was one of them trying to release the rope around her neck. 'Of the two people who were trying to hold her the female was the main one. She did her level best and also you could see it in her face how upset she was when she couldn’t hold on to her anymore. 'They should certainly get a commendation, either she would have fallen and if the rope was secure she would have hung herself or if it was unsecured she would have fallen 30 feet on to a marble floor. 'They certainly should be commended, I don’t think many would have acted like that, they were very quick thinking, she was literally in the process of climbing over when they grabbed her. 'We do see some strange things in court but I have been doing this job for more than 20 years and this has upset a lot of people. I had seen her just five minutes earlier with black marks on her face.' The woman is charged with false imprisonment and wasting police time by falsely reporting a crime on April 3. After she was brought to the floor she was held down by officers as she screamed before an ambulance came and took her away.","She tied a rope around her neck and tried to jump .

Manchester City has asked for a historic Austrian church to silence its bells to avoid disturbing star players during their pre-season training camp in the Tyrolean mountains. It is one on a long list of strict conditions City boss Roberto Mancini’s has requested that also include handmade £1,000 specially-designed mattresses and the meticulous arrangement of condiments on hotel tables at meal times. Details of City’s travel requirements were revealed by Alois Seyrling, manager of the Klosterbrau Hotel - a former monastery that is almost 500 years old - which will be the squad’s home until July 20. Bells be gone: The bells of St Oswald's church in the Austrian Tyrol won't ring at 7am while City players sleep soundly in the five-star hotel right next door . Star treatment: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero walked the red carpet as he arrived in Seefeld and will get a star's sleep without church bells chiming at 7am and a specially-made mattress and blanket costing almost £1,000 . Silent St Oswald's: Traditional chiming bells dating back to the 13th century have been silenced for an extra hour of sleep for the City players . The bells at St Oswald’s in Seefeld, a . 13th century Catholic church which adjoins the five star hotel, . normally chime on the hour from 7am but during City’s stay they will be . delayed by an hour to start at 8am at the request of team officials, Mr . Seyrling said. He said it was a very special request. ‘They . wanted to ask the priest to switch off the bells of the church because . we are attached to it and the bells are ringing at seven in the morning, . eight in the morning and nine in the morning,’ he said. City are spending more than £200,000 . for their stay in the small village, a favourite destination of wealthy . winter sports fans, in preparation for defending their Premier League . title. Five star training: City is spending over £200,000 for their training taking out 54 rooms in the five star hotel in preparation to defend their Premier League title . All to Austria: City's medical and fitness teams have been flown to the Austrian town to make sure players including Sergio Aguero (left) and Carlos Tevez (right) get into shape in time for the season . The hotel has spent . three months preparing for the arrival of stars like Sergio Aguero and . Yaya Toure in what has been a painstaking process. They were required to import . specially-approved mattresses, handmade in Rome, as City insisted on a . specific density and height to offer optimum support for players’ backs. Along . with lightweight blankets, which had to be 3cm thick, the cost came in . at little under £1,000 per bed for each of the 54 rooms booked out by . last season’s title-winners. When it came to accommodating 6ft 3in . Yaya Toure, it required a specially-extended bed, driven over personally . by the manufacturer in time for the Ivory Coast international’s . arrival. A good night's sleep: The hotel's bedrooms (pictured) have been kitted out with specially-made mattresses to support the players' backs . After a hard day's training: Players will relax with the hotel's spa treatments during their intensive fortnight of training . Towering Toure: The hotel made sure a specially-extended bed for 6ft 3in player Yaya Toure was driven in personally by the manufacturer . Toure is also the only player to have his own massage table in his room. The restrictions also stretch to the dining room, with the team’s Italian coach making sure the player’s dietary requirements are kept in check by forbidding all chocolates and snacks in minibars, bread and butter, and ordering hotel staff to not place sauces on tables. Mayonnaise or ketchup will only be allowed on special request and the parmesan cheese must be situated in the exact position for every meal. The City chef has been brought over and fresh fish is flown in every two days as well as a huge amount of bottled water from England. Mr Seyrling said: ‘They want privacy in the restaurant and we have a very clear set-up for the buffet. 'The set-up is very detailed in the restaurant - down to how much space is in between the chairs. 'The manager I have heard is quite strict. They sent us the menu so we have all of the products so their chef can prepare the meals. 'Fish is flown in. Most of the products we always buy locally because Austria has a high standard, especially for beef but the special fish they requested will be flown in fresh every two days from France, the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. City have also brought their entire medical and fitness teams with them to the picturesque region. The hotel offers a range of unusual spa treatments to help the players wind down after a day’s training including a tiny room in the stone-walled basement, containing an old-fashioned bread oven and three easy chairs. It is intended to offer a relaxing experience while guests can also enjoy the aroma of freshly baked bread. There is also a tank filled with garra rufa fish to eat dead skin from the feet as well as hay bath.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith wants people to a life on benefits is not an option . Thousands of benefit claimants in the 56,000 households that will be hit by a new £26,000-a-year cap on handouts are already looking for work, Iain Duncan Smith says today. Official figures released eight months before the Work and Pensions Secretary’s restrictions come into place suggest the policy is already pushing some people back into employment. Mr Duncan Smith, writing for the Daily Mail, argues that thousands are finally beginning to realise ‘life on welfare is no longer an option’. He also launches a strong attack on Labour for refusing to back the £26,000 benefit cap, accusing the Opposition of wanting to maintain a ‘culture of dependency’. Data collected by the Department for Work and Pensions show 1,700 claimants who would have been affected by the cap have moved into work. A further 5,000 have indicated they would like to receive support to find jobs. Officials say the figures are far higher than would have normally have been expected among this high-claiming group. Letters were sent out in May to those who could be affected by the cap, outlining intensive support that will be offered to help them move off benefits and into jobs before the policy comes into effect in April 2013. The figures, released as regulations to bring the new limit into force are laid in Parliament today, show that 56,000 households will be affected by the  benefit cap. Of those, more than 29,000 have four children or more, and more than 5,000 have six children or more. The figures reveal that more than 7,000 families in London are currently claiming over £34,000 a year in benefits – the equivalent of an annual income in the higher rate of income tax of around £47,000. The £26,000-a-year cap is supposed to ensure that those who are on benefits can no longer receive more in state  handouts than the average salary of a working family. New official figures suggest a new £26,000-a-year cap on handouts is driving more people back to work. (File picture) However, senior Tories want to go . further in the next stages of welfare reform. Options being considered . include a reduced cap of around £20,000 or regionalising benefits so . that lower limits are applied outside big cities, where housing costs . are higher. Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘These figures show the benefit cap is already a success and is actively encouraging people back to work. ‘They also show that Labour’s criticism of the cap was nothing but needless scaremongering and opposition for opposition’s sake. Officials say reforms mean those who go back to work will be better off than those who stay on benefits . ‘When it comes to the tough decisions, Labour don’t have it in them to govern. It’s sheer madness that people on benefits can be getting as much as a higher-rate taxpayer earns. We need a welfare state that acts as a safety net and encourages people back to work, not traps them in out-of-work dependency.’ The Government has made a number of concessions to critics who warned the cap was too blunt an instrument, offering some exemptions for those on sickness benefits and giving those who have been in long-term employment for a year or more before they start claiming longer to find a new job. Officials pointed to one example of a single parent with six children who has been on welfare benefits since August 2010 and would have been affected by the cap. The unnamed woman accepted a Jobcentre Plus offer of employment support, with training, and found a 16-hour-a-week job on the national minimum wage. Calculations show the household will be £100.62 better off per week, and as a lone parent she is now entitled to working tax credit  and will no longer have the benefit cap applied. The cap will also not apply to those who claim Disability Living Allowance, Constant Attendance Allowance and Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit, recognising the extra costs they face. Those who receive a War Widow’s or  Widower’s Pension will be exempt, and those who have been employed for 12 months or more and lose their job through no fault of their own will have nine months before the benefit cap applies  to them. Iain Duncan Smith, pictured with his wife Betsy, says he was shocked to discover families claiming £100,000 a year in housing benefits . Today, the Government will lay regulations to bring the benefit cap into law. It will ensure that people can no longer receive more than £26,000 a year in state handouts, the same as the average salary. The last government lost control of welfare spending, for in a decade of growth, spending on welfare rose by an enormous 40 per cent. Take just two benefits. Spending on tax credits totalled £171billion in the last six years, while housing benefit nearly doubled in ten years to £21billion a year by the time of the last election. Worse, Labour planned to let it grow to a staggering £25billion by 2014-15. I was shocked when I realised it was possible for families to claim over £100,000 a year for help with housing costs, in addition to other benefits. It cannot be right that families on benefits are paid to live in large houses, in exclusive areas that hard-working people simply could never dream of being able to afford. This is unfair to the taxpayer and to those in low-paid work doing their best to maintain financial independence. But it also creates a huge stumbling block to those who are unemployed, who cannot take the positive step into work because they fear losing their home as their housing benefit is tapered away. Under the last government, the safety net became a cage, but today marks another step towards ending that trap. The benefit system should be seen as a means of temporary support for those who fall on hard times, rather than a lifestyle choice. Despite the mess the last government left behind, as I have tried to reform the system and bring this under control, Labour have set about scaremongering as they opposed each and every one of our changes. They have objected to our work experience programme which helps young people back to work, carped at our reforms to sickness benefit and, of course, they oppose the benefit cap. Despite all the scaremongering, research now shows that of those housing benefit claimants affected by the cap, a third said they would now be looking for a job. We are already seeing cases of people moving into work, and many others are seeking out the targeted support available to move into employment – all this some eight months before the cap is even introduced. We are witnessing a shift in behaviour as many are finally beginning to realise that a life on welfare is no longer an option. Despite the economic difficulties, we now have fewer people economically inactive than we have had since the election, and even since records began. This is precisely what our reforms are designed to do: create a welfare culture that incentivises work and limits those high benefit payments so that hard-working taxpayers can feel that the system is fair to them, while bringing to an end Labour’s damaging culture of dependency.","Department for Work .

The BBC has been accused of being ‘testosterone-fuelled’ after nine times as many male experts than women were shown on its flagship nightly news bulletin. Nearly all the interviewees appearing on the BBC’s Ten O’Clock News were male, according to researchers. The study, carried out over a week, found there was a night last month when only one woman featured on the programme ‘in any capacity at all’ – and she was on for only seconds. Unbalanced: Nearly all the interviewees appearing on the BBC’s Ten O’Clock News were male, according to researchers . Last night, critics questioned whether the BBC was even making an effort to reflect Britain’s gender balance, saying it was either ‘lazy’ or ‘playing it safe’. Researchers from City University London carried out the study for industry magazine Broadcast. Anti-discrimination campaigner Miriam O’Reilly said she was not surprised. She said: ‘I saw the news on June 13. I was actually shouting at the screen “Where are the women?”’ Miss O’Reilly, who won an ageism case against the BBC after she was removed from Countryfile, added: ‘I don’t know whether they are playing it safe or being lazy.’ Not surprised: Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly thought the BBC were being 'safe' or 'lazy' A BBC News spokesman said: ‘We do take the issue seriously and are working to improve the gender balance, although the BBC cannot dictate who organisations put forward for interview.’ The Ten O'Clock News compared badly with rival shows. While it could only manage one in ten women as experts, for Channel 4 News it was three to one in favour of men and four to one on Newsnight. The BBC1 show's main rival, ITV's News At Ten, was shown to have a ratio of five men to every women when it came to expert guests. Writing for Broadcast, Lis Howell director of broadcasting at the university, said even for broader topics such as gay marriage, male interviewees were used ‘for every aspect of the story'. The academic said: ‘Never mind women experts - there weren't any UK women at all. 'Our monitor noted that within the 27-minute programme, the only woman to feature appeared in an item about the Egyptian elections. How ironic is that? ] . ‘On a British news programme, the only woman who made it on air was an Egyptian in a gym - a vox pop at that. ‘Is it really likely that no women did anything of significance or had anything to say, in the whole UK, on that day? Even the most intransigent male elitist would have to admit that it bizarre.' h. Miss Howell said that because women journalists often appeared on the programme, such as Stephanie Flanders, as well as presenters Sophie Raworth and Fiona Bruce, there was an impression women were being fairly represented. In her article she said the ‘extravagant' amount of time given to sport was part of the problem. The research monitored the use of women on the Ten O'Clock News between Tuesday June 12 and Monday June 18. The other shows were measured between Monday, June 11 to Friday June 15. According to the research sport was responsible for between three and four minutes of most editions of the news programme in the week being measured. Politics was found to have averaged about five minutes per night. The research also revealed that the only Ten O'Clock News ‘package' with more women than men in during the week was about poor families in Greece. Miss Howell said: ‘Stereotypes from the BBC? Perish the thought.' The monitoring found that Channel 4 ‘gets the prize' for best use of female experts. As well as guests like Theresa May it also used women to contribute to general stories. Commended: As well as guests like Theresa May Channel 4 News also used women to contribute to general stories . The findings come after earlier this year director general Mark Thompson said there are not enough older women on television. He admitted the corporation had a ‘case to answer' over the lack of female presenters - especially in ‘iconic roles' and there were ‘manifestly too few older women broadcasting on the BBC'. Mr Thompson added there were simply not enough women in ‘key news and current affairs presenting roles', singling out the ‘big political interviews'. He had said that while economics editor Stephanie Flanders is ‘outstanding' there are too few women among the most senior on-air specialist journalists. In recent years, respected figures such as Anna Ford, Selina Scott, Kate Adie, Dame Joan Bakewell and many others have spoken out about their concerns over the treatment of older women by all broadcasters.In recent months this has broadened out to include the shortage of women as experts and contributors on news programmes.","Nearly all interviewees appearing on the BBC’s Ten O’Clock News were male, according to researchers .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:24 EST, 23 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:42 EST, 23 July 2012 . Accused: Drew Peterson, 57, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio . Drew Peterson introduced himself to . would-be jurors today as jury selection began in the former suburban . Chicago police officer's long-delayed murder trial. Peterson, 58, is charged with killing . his third wife, Kathleen Savio, in 2004. Her body was found in a dry . bathtub in her home, her hair soaked with blood. The ex-Bolingbrook . police sergeant also is a suspect in the 2007 disappearance of his . fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, although he has not been charged. Peterson, his trademark mustache shaved off, stood and spoke to some 40 potential jurors as proceedings began today. 'Good morning ladies and gentlemen, I'm Mr Peterson,' he said in a steady voice. During the trial, jurors are likely to . hear statements the women allegedly made to friends and relatives about . threats Peterson made. Such hearsay is usually barred, but an appellate . court ruled jurors can hear the statements. The 200-person jury pool has been . waiting three years for a trial to get under way. It was put off because . of appellate court battles over the hearsay statements. 'I've never heard of anything comparable . to this — a jury pool waiting around for so long knowing what case . they're going to be in and the reliance on hearsay,' said Gal Pissetzky, . a Chicago defense lawyer with no link to the case. Publicity in the case is an issue as the . judge and attorneys question jurors. The legal saga surrounding . Peterson and whether he used his status as a police officer to try to . get away with murder has attracted national attention. Rob Lowe . portrayed Peterson in a 2011 TV movie, Drew Peterson: Untouchable. The defense raised concerns that some . prospective jurors may have violated orders to avoid all news about . Peterson. Some of the half dozen would-be jurors questioned by the judge on . Monday acknowledged they have been unable to completely avoid the . television, radio and newspaper coverage of the case. One man said that when he hears . Peterson's name on the radio he switches it off or leaves the room. But . the man said that just last week he saw Peterson's photograph splashed . across the front page of a suburban Chicago newspaper. One woman who was asked what she thinks she's heard about the case answered: 'Something about a bathtub.' Earlier days: Former Bolingbrook police sergeant Drew Peterson talks to the media as he leaves his home in Bolingbrook, Illinois in 2007 . In memoriam: Flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of Kathleen Savio, the third wife of Peterson, at the Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois . Vetting would-be jurors typically takes a . few days, but extra time is sometimes required in high-profile cases to . weed out those who come in with well-formed opinions. Opening . statements at Peterson's trial in Joliet are slated for next Tuesday. Jurors are likely to hear from a parade . of pathologists who will dispute each other's conclusions about how Kathleen Savio died, aged just 40. They will hear about her death being ruled an . accident, her body being exhumed after 23-year-old Stacy Peterson's . disappearance and the autopsy after which her cause of death was changed . from accidental to homicide — and the continued dispute over those . findings. There's apparently no physical evidence, so the hearsay is the heart of prosecutors' case. Before jury selection began today, Will . County Judge Edward Burmila refused prosecutors' request to give them . blanket approval to admit eight key hearsay statements. Burmila said he . will make a final ruling on the admissibility of each statement only as . they come up at trial. Neither Burmila nor the attorneys spoke in any detail about the substance of the eight statements. At a 2010 hearing to determine what . hearsay a jury could hear, dozens of witnesses testified that Savio told . them she feared Peterson would kill her and make it look like an . accident. One question looming over the trial is . how much Peterson's personality will influence the jury. Before his . arrest, Peterson was often seen joking about a 'Win A Date With Drew' contest, his missing wife's menstrual cycle and other topics that were . widely seen as inappropriate. Grave charges: Peterson is accused of murdering Kathleen Savio, left.  It was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub, right, but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide . Peterson often joked with an army of news crews camped outside his house and even invited Geraldo Rivera into his kitchen. Brodsky has said the three years that . Peterson has been in jail and largely out of the public eye might help . him because the memories of his behavior have faded. Peterson, jailed since his 2009 arrest, . pleaded not guilty. His attorneys say Savio's death was an accident and . that Stacy Peterson — 30 years younger than Drew Peterson — ran off with . another man and is alive. Authorities have said they believe she is . dead, although her body has never been found. The frenetic coverage 'absolutely . has the possibility of reigniting,' said Mark Geragos, a prominent . California defense attorney who has been at the center of comparable . firestorms, including when he represented Scott Peterson (no relation), a . California man convicted of murdering his young wife and unborn child. Prosecutors . expect to tell a relatively simple story: Drew Peterson killed his . ex-wife to keep her from making off with much of his money in a . contentious divorce. Sometime around February 29, 2004, . according to the indictment, Peterson went to Savio's house and in the . bathroom caused her 'to inhale fluid', killing her. Observers say Peterson may benefit . from the three years he's been behind bars and out of the public eye, if . only because he spent much of the past three years in solitary . confinement, with his only human contact being from guards bringing him . meals. 'He really was . becoming one of the more hated individuals in America,' Joe Tacopina, a . prominent defence attorney in New York. 'Because he was in . jail, he took himself off the front page, and that can only help him . with a jury pool.' Peterson's . attorney agreed. 'Nobody's going to deny that Drew's relatively goofy . behaviour rubbed people the wrong way,' said Joel Brodsky, who explained . Peterson's actions as both the by-product of a sometimes grim job and . his way of moving on after his wife left him. 'The fact that he hasn't been at that for a period of years certainly helps some of his past antics fade from memory.' Missing: Peterson, right, is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, right . But . that simple story is complicated by what happened after Savio's body . was discovered by a friend of Peterson's. Peterson had called the friend . to the house to look for Savio, saying he was worried. Detectives are expected to testify, . as they did at a hearing in 2010, that nobody collected a single . fingerprint or hair fiber at the house. They will likely acknowledge . that Savio's relatives, who could have told investigators about the . couple's on-going battles, were never interviewed. Jurors . may also hear, as a judge did at the 2010 hearing, that Peterson was . allowed to sit in on a police interview with Stacy Peterson as a . 'professional courtesy'. This happened while officers were trying to . confirm Peterson's whereabouts the weekend Savio died. The one-time policeman of the year, told a reporter at the Chicago Sun Times: 'I’m sick of being called sinister.' Instead . he insisted he was a romantic and his disastrous track record with . women was not his fault - it was because he picked 'women who changed . after getting married'. Taken in: Police Lt. Carl Anderson, left, and a fellow investigator escort Drew Peterson, centre, into District 5 State Police headquarters in 2009 . Times past: Peterson, pictured on his motorcycle two months before his indictment in 2009, left, and right, with missing fourth wife Stacy Peterson . Authorities then reopened the . investigation into the March 2004 death of his third wife Kathleen . Savio, who was initially thought to have drowned accidentally in her . bathtub. But it was reclassified as a homicide after her body was exhumed and a medical examiner ruled she drowned following a struggle. Peterson was arrested and charged with her death in May 2009 and is being held on $20million bail. During the 30-minute interview in the jail's visitor center, Peterson . spoke about his children claiming to be a good father. He said his sons with Kathleen Savio, Thomas and Kristopher, had never asked him if he had . killed their mother because they knew he had not. He also said that he told his youngest children, Anthony and Lacy, that their mother Stacy was on vacation. They . are currently being looked after by one of his son's from his first . marriage - Peterson has six children from three of his four marriages. When asked if he missed Stacy he said . he did sometimes, but said if she did reappear the first thing he would . do is 'ask her to sign the divorce papers'. Family: During the interview Peterson claimed he was very close with his two children he had with his third wife, Savio: Thomas and Kristopher . He . said his last girlfriend Christina Raines has asked him to marry her . three years ago, but he had not seen her since she had become . intimidated by the press. Last . year it emerged that Peterson had written a dozen jail-house love . letters from jail, repeatedly propositioning a woman he has known since . she was 14. Diana . Grandel, now 40, said the former Illinois police sergeant has been . plaguing her with bizarre and increasingly sexual requests, like asking . for her measurements, photos of her in a bikini as well as describing . what he wants to do to her in bed. He also asked her if she had any sexually transmitted diseases. In . letters, obtained by the National Enquirer, he wrote to her: 'I just . think of your smile and holding you in the dark feeling your body . against mine...I want to spend a lot of time with my lips on yours. 'I like sex with a lot of foreplay, I'm more into pleasing my partner than pleasing others.' Peterson . spoke to Miss Grandel about the disappearance of his fourth wife, . sticking to his story that she walked out on him, saying she could have . all her clothes.","Drew Peterson, 57, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio .

A dog owner was jailed for four months today after a six-year-old schoolboy was brutally savaged by his pet called Tyson. Erfan Ali was scarred for life when the Rhodesian Ridgeback - bred to hunt lions - pounced from over the next door neighbour’s fence as he was helping his mother bring in washing from the garden. He had both sides of his face ripped off by the dog and only survived because the dog was eventually wrestled off. Scarred: Erfan Ali had both sides of his face ripped off by the dog and only survived because the dog was eventually wrestled off. He is pictured right with his scarred face and left just a short while after the attack . Owner Kevin Large, 27, admitted failing to control 18-month-old Tyson who has since been destroyed. Prosecutor Huw Evans said: 'Erfan had been in the garden with his mother playing in the washing basket when the dog grabbed his right hand. Jailed: Owner Kevin Large, 27, admitted failing to control 18-month-old Tyson who has since been destroyed . 'The child was screaming and Mrs Ali was desperately trying to get the dog off her son whilst at the same time retreating to the kitchen’s open door. 'By holding on to Erfan and trying to grapple with the dog she was able to get the dog off his arm and get him into the house. 'She couldn’t close the door quickly enough and Tyson followed them - that’s when it decided to go for the child’s face.' Primary school pupil Erfan was attacked when Large’s 18-month-old dog entered the family’s garden through a hole in the fence. Cardiff Crown Court heard how the family were all scared of the dog and had asked Large repeatedly to secure the fence. But his botched job of holding it in place with rope and nails was unable to contain the large dog who attacked Erfan at his home in the Gabalfa area of Cardiff. After the attack Erfan was rushed from his home to a specialist Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery in Morriston, Swansea. He needed stitches to his hand, knee, lip, eyebrow and required skin grafts and around 170 stitches to repair wounds on both cheeks. He will require surgery throughout his life to correct the scaring caused by the attack. Large later took the dog back to his home and put him in a cage, the police were then called to the scene and the dog was destroyed. He pleaded guilty to allowing a dog to enter a place where it injured a person, an offence under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. Matthew Cobbe, defense, said: 'The incident is awful and by Large’s own admission he has been suffering from nightmares about it. 'He has attended court with remorse and is very sorry for the injuries.' Judge Nicholas Jones sentenced Large to four months in prison and banned him from keeping dogs for 10 years. Injured: Little Erfan in hospital where had 170 stitches in his hand, knee, lip and eyebrow as well as skin grafts . He said: said: 'This offending is so . serious immediate custody is necessary. Persons who own dogs like this . must understand they are dangerous and must understand if they are . allowed to go and cause serious injury the courts will pass an immediate . prison sentence.' Rhodesian Ridgebacks are a South African breed of dog known for their bravery. Male dogs are often more than 70 cm tall and weigh around 85lb. They are also known as African Lion Hounds as they have been used to hunt lions. They are not banned in the UK. They are said to be calm, gentle and obedient but can become highly strung if they do not get enough exercise . Speaking after the sentencing, Erfan Ali’s parents called for laws governing the ownership of dangerous dogs to be tightened. Dilwar and Monowara Ali said: 'This attack has left our brave little son physically and mentally scarred. 'Despite . brilliant work by the specialist NHS team he will still have to undergo . repeat surgical procedures well into his teens and ultimately will be . left with significant facial scarring for the rest of his life. 'In this case, the dog attacked our son in our own back garden and forced its way into our house when our son fled inside. 'The attack happened when our son was in his own home - the place where he should feel at his safest. 'This has had a catastrophic effect on his sense of security and that of our family. 'We . all hope that the conclusion of the case will allow us to move forward . and start pushing this traumatic experience behind us.

"Study finds 90% of women have been on a diet . Average woman loses her body weight over nine times during her life . Women in North West find it most difficult to diet . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 04:58 EST, 18 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:44 EST, 18 September 2012 . Diet fads come and go, from Atkins to the Dukan diet, there is always a new means to a thinner end. And with 90 per cent of British women having been on some form of diet in their lifetime, it has now been revealed that women spend a staggering 17 years of their life dieting. Of these loyal dieters, the average woman loses her body weight over nine times during her life time. Women spend a staggering seventeen years of their lives dieting and the average will lose their body weight over nine times . The study also found that the average woman diets twice a year, losing 11lbs each time. Life expectancy data reveals that the average woman lives until 82 and weighs on average 11 stone, so if she begins dieting at the age of 18, she will lose her body weight 9.1 times and if she spends seven weeks on a diet twice a year she will spend 17.2 years dieting. Kevin Dorren, Founder & Head Chef of Diet Chef, who carried out the research, said: ‘Deciding to lose weight can be an easy one to make when we know we have a special occasion coming up or aren’t feeling confident in our appearance, however as we can see actually embarking on a diet and losing the extra pounds is more difficult and takes real commitment.' Health reasons, having a muffin top and wanting to look good in a bikini are top incentives for dieting . Those in the North West find it hardest to stick to a diet, only able to sum up the stamina for four days on average – the shortest amount of time in the UK. Whereas those in the North East (11 per cent) and East Anglia (17 per cent) have the most willpower with their last diet lasting one month. Less than one per cent of women managed to stick to a diet for a 12 month period and a third of all women diet for at least six months per year. Summer holidays (33 per cent) Health reasons . (22 per cent) Weddings (18 per cent) Not fitting into any of their clothes was the top prompt (52 per cent) to lose weight with the same number of people saying that developing a muffin top was the first sign that they had piled on the pounds. Ultimately it is a general love of food (35 per cent) and lack of willpower (33 per cent) that keeps would-be dieters from achieving their dream body with over a third saying they were their main reasons for struggling with managing their weight loss. Although a fifth of women say that they find it too expensive to buy healthy food. One in three women will splurge on comfort purchases when feeling down about their diet, with shoes being the top thing to buy (37 per cent).","Study finds 90% of women have been on a diet .

Staunch: Barack Obama has shown no inclination he wants to significantly tighten gun control laws in the wake of the weekend shootings . It is considered a basic right by many Americans and Barack Obama has shown no inclination to significantly tighten gun control laws in the wake of the weekend shootings at a cinema. The president reiterated the stance outlined in a piece published in an Arizona newspaper in March last year when he emphasised the need to protect citizens’ right to bear arms. White House press secretary Jay Carney, was quoted on abc News today saying that Obama’s views have not altered since 12 people died in shootings at the Dark Knight Rises Batman premiere in Aurora, Colorado. Mr Carney said: ‘He [the president] believes we need to take steps that protect Second Amendment rights of the American people but that ensure that we are not allowing weapons into the hands of individuals who should not, by existing law, obtain those weapons.' The announcement is in keeping with the position the president has taken throughout his tenure, namely to avoid a conflict with the powerful National Rifle Association. Should gun owners face tougher restrictions in wake of Aurora shooting? In the op-ed article published in the Arizona Star in March 2011, two months after the shootings in Tucson, Arizona, in which six people were killed and 13 — including now former Republican Gabrielle Giffords — were wounded, the president called for a focus on 'sound and effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place.' Horrific: Friends of Cecilia Alexander, 17, centre, comfort her after a memorial service at Gateway High School for movie theater shooting victim AJ Boik. Measures identified included a drive to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System by using incentives to encourage states to 'provide the best data — and therefore do the most to protect our citizens.’ The aim, said Mr Obama, was to make the system faster and more agile to create a structure that was ‘instant, accurate, comprehensive and consistent for background checks’ to those selling guns who want to do the right thing and to ensure that criminals can’t evade it. Massacre gunman: Checks Mr Obama wants to introduce would not have prevented the alleged Aurora shooter James Holmes . Such checks would not have prevented the alleged Aurora shooter, because James Holmes had no criminal record, bar a speeding ticket, and the indications are that he purchased the guns he used legally. Mr Carney added: 'The president’s view is that we can take steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them under existing law, and that’s his focus right now.' The spokesman also said there was no thought of pushing to renew a ban on assault weapons which expired in 2004 but which might have covered one of the weapons used by the shooter as well as a large capacity ammunition feeding device. Both Democratic officeholders and voters in important battleground states are against gun control and on CNN this morning Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper defended the second amendment right. He said: 'If it wasn’t one weapon, it would have been another. I mean, he was diabolical. If you look at what he had in his apartment and what his intentions were… If there were no assault weapons available, and no this or no that, this guy is going to find something, right? He’s going to know how to create a bomb.'","President says steps need to be taken to protect Second Amendment rights .

"Buffett and wife Susan lived apart for almost 30 years but never divorced . By . Meghan Keneally . UPDATED: . 16:25 EST, 13 January 2012 . The affable demeanor of Warren Buffett is not what one might expect when picturing one of the world’s most hard-nosed and successful businessmen. But neither is the image of him bursting into tears mid-interview when discussing his first wife, Susan, who died of oral cancer in 2004. Their relationship was always an unconventional one more akin to Hollywood than that of his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. For after marrying in 1952 they stayed as husband and wife despite her moving away in 1977 and him forming a relationship with a close friend of hers. Mostly happy guy: Though he is generally upbeat, the subject of his first wife's death brings Mr Buffett to tears . Loving wife: Just two months before she died in 2004, Susan Buffett spoke about her love of Warren and their unbreakable bond . Susan died of the cancer in 2004 and it was talking about her that brought the business titan to tears. ‘Her death is - it’s just terrible. It’s the only thing that’s really up there,’ Mr Buffett said in an interview with Time Magazine. ‘I still can’t talk about it,’ he said as he cried for several minutes. Mr Buffett met Susan at an early age, when she was headed to college to be his younger sister’s roommate at Northwestern University. ‘He made some sarcastic quip - I hadn’t even met him - so I made one back and I thought “Who is this jerk?”’ Susan said in a 2004 interview with Charlie Rose. The new group: Warren and Astrid Buffett walk with his daughter Susan who hosted their 15-minute wedding ceremony at her Omaha house . Mr Buffett then pursued Susan and she eventually relented, leading to a marriage in 1952. The couple had three children- Susie, Howard, and Peter- and lived in Omaha as Mr Buffett grew his business, Berkshire Hathaway, into one of the country’s biggest investment firms. Then, in 1977, Susan decided that she wanted to move away in an effort to pursue her own life and a career as a singer. ‘You know I would like to have a place where I could have a room of my own,’ she said in the interview with Mr Rose. Before she left, Susan told her friend Astrid Menks to check in on Mr Buffett during her absence, saying that his financial savvy did not always translate into social skills. ‘I called Astrid. I said “Astrid, will you take Warren, make him some soup, go over there and look after him?”’ Susan said. Bright future: Astrid and Warren got married in 2006, two years after Susan died and almost 30 years after they started their relationship . Life partners: Even after Susan (right) moved to San Francisco in 1977, the couple stayed as close as ever and never split up . Astrid and Mr Buffett then started a relationship, and that was fine by Susan. All three were very aware of their set-up and it seemed to work happily for all parties involved. They even sent out joint Christmas cards every year with their three names at the bottom. Mr Buffett never divorced Susan and only married Astrid two years after her death. The most recent tears that Mr Buffett shed over Susan are certainly not the first, as he was known to cry for hours during her prolonged battle with oral cancer. Family values: Mr Buffett (center right) is joined by (L-R) son Howard, daughter Susie and son Peter at a Berkshire Hathaway event . One big, happy family: (L-R) Buffett's daughter Susie sits beside her dad and mom Susan at a business function in 1997 . During her treatment, when she could not eat solid foods, Mr Buffett would cut himself down to 1,000 calories a day in solidarity, and would sit with her and watch episodes of Frasier in the San Francisco hospital room. He could not force himself to attend her funeral because he would become too upset thinking about her and trying to keep a brave face. Mr Buffett frequently attributes his success and his political consciousness to Susan, which can still be seen today as he continues to champion the cause of getting the super-wealthy to give back through charity and involvement in government. Living arrangements: When Susan moved to San Francisco, Astrid then started a relationship with Mr Buffett and the three were all very happy .","Buffett and wife Susan lived apart for almost 30 years but never divorced .

Following the hearing, her father . Stuart, who is divorced from Mrs Clarke, said he did not accept evidence . his daughter was likely to have died even if she had been wearing a . safety helmet. Remote: A mountain Village close to the Malealea Lodge in Lesotho, South-Eastern Africa, where Miss Wilson and Mr Langton had been staying on the trip . The Nottingham inquest heard that tour guides had not been issued with first aid kits or training, or even mobile phones. When the hospital was contacted, . using a fellow tourist’s phone, it did not send a helicopter for four . hours, until guides had broken in to lockers to get Miss Wilson’s . insurance details. Mrs Clarke, 53, said Mr Langton spent . almost four hours performing mouth-to-mouth while trying to stem the . flow of blood from his partner’s head wounds. Although travellers were advised . before their holidays to take helmets if they wanted to wear one, Mr . Langton, who lives in Selby, North Yorkshire, told the inquest he saw . helmets hanging in the stables when they set off on the overnight trek . to a mountain village. He added: ‘This was a trip aimed at . novice riders and I can say with 100 per cent certainty we were not . given any instructions on how to ride the horse.’ The accident occurred the next  day as they returned to their lodge from the trek in November 2009. Consultant neurosurgeon Ian Robertson . told the inquest Miss Wilson would probably have died even if she had . been taken to hospital within 30 minutes. Miss Wilson, left, parties with a friend. She graduated from Aston University in Birmingham with a first class honours degree and landed a job at BT . While a helmet may have lessened the . initial impact, he said it would not have prevented the injuries caused . by being dragged along. Delivering a narrative verdict, . Nottinghamshire Deputy Coroner Heidi Connor said: ‘The evidence is clear . that this was not horses riding in a straight line over stable terrain. This was something significantly more risky than that.’ Mrs Clarke said the evidence showed the company ‘failed to provide the most basic care to the people travelling with them’. Martyn Shapter, of Peak Adventure . Travel Group, which owned Imaginative Traveller at the time, said they . expected guides would have given advice and have first aid training. But the trek, which was provided by a local firm, was not considered to be high-risk. Dragoman Overseas, the current owner of Imaginative Traveller, now provides the tours in-house. Notts Deputy Coroner Heidi Connor recorded a narrative verdict, saying: 'I am satisfied that even if Gemma was wearing a helmet, the outcome would have been the same. But I must consider that in other situations this could be the difference between life and death. 'The evidence is that helmets should have been offered as they were available on the day, but this simply did not happen.' Speaking after the inquest, Miss Wilson's heartbroken father Stuart Wilson, 52, from the Scottish Borders, said that he did not accept the verdict or the findings of the inquest. 'I was looking for closure today, but that doesn’t appear to be the case,' he said. 'I plan to sit down and discuss this with my family and I am looking to appeal this decision. 'Gemma was exceptional and was going to be successful. Her death was devastating and James and the whole family have been traumatised by this. 'I wouldn’t stop my children from going on these adventure treks, but I want to ensure that the number one priority of these companies is the safety of their customers.'","Gemma Wilson took dream holiday with partner James Langton after graduating from Aston University .

Ashley Harris, 29, died on Sunday evening. She was the wife of San Diego Chargers defensive tackle Tommie Harris and had two young children, Tyson, aged three, and four month-old Tinsley. The couple had married on New Year's Day this year and were planning to hold a wedding reception in Oklahoma. Tragic loss: NFL player Tommie Harris and his wife Ashley, who died aged 29 of a suspected brain aneurysm . Ashley Harris was taken to hospital on . Friday afternoon in Norman, Oklahoma while the couple were in town for a . visit, according to the Daily Herald. Tommie Harris played college football for the University of Oklahoma. He had a four-year, $40 million contract with the Bears but was released at the end of the 2010 season and moved to the San Diego Chargers last September. An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the vessel wall. As blood passes through the weakened vessel, the blood pressure causes it to bulge outwards like a balloon. Aneurysms within the body or brain often have no symptoms. If an aneurysm ruptures, pain, low blood pressure, a rapid heart rate, and lightheadedness may occur. The risk of death after a rupture is high. An official cause of death for Mrs Harris has not yet been confirmed but an autopsy was pending. Family friend Bill Horn told the Chicago . Tribune: 'He's obviously in disbelief. 'But he's got such a strong . support group, teammates and everybody around him.'

"By . Paul Milligan . PUBLISHED: . 13:04 EST, 21 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:47 EST, 22 May 2012 . The police investigation to find Sumon Miah's killer was closed in 2008, but was reopened after new evidence emerged in 2010 . A mother who arranged for her 13-year-old daughter’s boyfriend to be battered to death after he posted topless pictures of the girl on the internet is facing jail today. Gedu Bibi, 47, lured 21 year-old hospital worker Sumon Miah to her home after being shown the photos of the schoolgirl. Once there he was hit over the head with a table leg and fell into a coma from which he never recovered. Mr Miah died nine days later from brain damage on October 17, 2006. Bibi got her teenage daughter to tell police she had hit the victim in self defence after he turned up with a knife. Her 12 year-old son Fhalak also backed up the story. Detectives shut down their investigation in 2008 but fresh information emerged two years later which led to Bibi and her former lover, 48-year-old cafe owner Lilu Miah, being charged with murder. After a trial at the Old Bailey, jurors cleared Bibi of murder but convicted her of manslaughter and perverting the course of justice. Lilu Miah was cleared of both murder and manslaughter. Bibi, who claimed she was asleep at the time of the attack, had suggested that her husband Angur Miah was involved. Judge Gerald Gordon said he would sentence Bibi at a later date when her counsel is available. The court heard Sumon Miah and Shuhina Khanam started a relationship after meeting at the hospital where he worked as a porter while she visited a friend. Just days before the attack, Lilu Miah had shown Bibi four lewd photos of her daughter he had discovered on the internet. On October 8, 2006, he was invited into Bibi’s family home in Walthamstow on October 8, 2006. After being knocked out with the table leg, the weapon was immediately wiped clean and then thrust into the hands of Shuhina to ensure it held her fingerprints. No blood or hairs were found on the weapon, and only her prints were found on the knife she claimed Miah had threatened her with. Gedu Bibi, was convicted of the manslaughter of Sumon Miah, at the Old Bailey, and perverting the course of justice . Following Sumon’s death, a friend handed his camera phone to the police - with the same pictures still saved in its memory. ‘It seems likely that these photographs were the trigger for the show-down that took place that day,’ said Mr Aylett. Lilu Miah admitted his guilt to close friend Monor Uddin, but it was not until Miah was behind bars that he gave an account to police. ‘He said he had done this murder by himself,’ he told jurors. 'He did it. As soon as the boy came in the door they push him in the sofa. Lilu was sitting in the kitchen with a stock. Lilu came out and banged his head just once. The boy collapsed. The stick was given to Shahina.’ During the trial, it emerged Lilu Miah’s teenage daughter had told police her father had ‘got away with murder’ - but officers ignored the information because the file had been closed. Bibi concocted a story that allowed her and the killer or killers to cheat justice for years, said prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC. 'If that was intended to hoodwink the police into an entirely false position, it worked,’ he said. 'Years went by without any charges being brought. But, in time, the case came to be reviewed.’ When Bibi was finally arrested, she claimed she was asleep when the killing took place, while Lilu Miah claimed he had been working at his cafe. She was overheard by a police officer fluent in her Bengali dialect muttering: ‘One bastard died, and we have to go through this.’ While being photographed in the police station, she added: ‘It’s good the b*****d died.’ Even more damning evidence came when a recording from a 999 call made seconds after the attack was re-examined. Talking to a police operator, Fhalak claimed Sumon Miah was outside the house trying to get in. But, listening carefully, an expert in phonetics heard a man groaning in pain in the background - revealing he had already been hit. In the same tape, Bibi is heard ordering Lilu Miah to flee: ‘Go now, get out of this house - through the garden.’ Bibi, of Forest Gate, east London, and Lilu Miah, of no fixed address, both denied murder.","Sumon Miah died from brain damage after being hit over the head with a table leg .

"By . Richard Dyson and Martin Delgado . PUBLISHED: . 16:18 EST, 9 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:29 EST, 16 June 2012 . Britain's biggest high-street stores have been accused of preying on vulnerable families by encouraging customers to gamble on their online shopping. Boots, Sainsbury's and Asda are among the 150 well-known retailers that offered their internet  customers the chance to win their shopping by placing a £1 stake on the spin of a roulette wheel. Shoppers using the stores' own websites to buy everyday items are told they have an 'unbeatable way to win anything you want'. Asda is one of the stores accused of preying on vulnerable families by encouraging customers to gamble on their online shopping . But last night MPs and anti- gambling charities condemned the stores for introducing gambling into the home as an everyday activity – and said families already  facing economic hardship risked losing hundreds of pounds while doing their shopping. To take part, customers open an online account with a gaming company. This allows them to browse through the stores' catalogues. When they find an item they want, they can choose to 'play' or 'shop'. If they click on 'play', £1 is deducted from their account and a roulette wheel pops up. If it lands on red, the user has won the item. If they don't win, they are not required to buy the product. But they are encouraged by various incentives, including discounts on future purchases and up to 25 'free plays', to spin the wheel again. High Street giant Boots said it has suspended its account with Yipiii pending further investigation . The scheme is operated by Yipiii Gaming, a Maltese gambling business, unregulated by British watchdogs. Hours . after The Mail on Sunday started raising ethical questions about the . scheme, several stores began withdrawing from it, apparently concerned . over the damage it might do to their reputations. Yipiii says that the odds of winning vary according to a complex mathematical formula, but that 85p in every £1 spent is returned to prizewinners, with the remaining 15p used to cover profit and costs. The site lures customers with promises of 'free' goods worth up to £30,000 and a pledge that 'with Yipiii, you never lose'. A tool has also been developed that makes the Yipiii roulette wheel appear each time someone logs on to one of the participating retailers' websites. But although customers were able to play the game directly on the stores' own sites, many of retailers told The Mail on Sunday they were not aware of it, and blamed third-party operators who link between websites to attract  more customers. Marks and Spencer, Asda, Debenhams, Comet, Sainsbury's, Boots,  Dixons and Selfridges last night said they were in the process of withdrawing from the scheme. Business Secretary Vince Cable  said he was 'disturbed' to hear of the scheme, saying: 'Gambling is quite rightly highly regulated because of the damage it can cause and it's clearly unacceptable to blur the boundaries between gambling and retail shopping. I am pleased to hear that responsible retailers are moving away from this.' Business Secretary Vince Cable said the scheme was 'disturbing' Conservative MP James Gray said he felt 'very uneasy' about the scheme, adding: 'Online gambling is a terrible evil and if store websites are encouraging people to gamble, I strongly oppose it. 'If the majority of stores are withdrawing their names from the scheme it sounds very questionable.' Mike Judge, of the Christian Institute, added: 'These companies have behaved in an irresponsible and  deplorable way. Schemes like this are  particularly dangerous for people on low incomes because they feel they can get out of their financial difficulties by gambling. But the result is often wrecked families and wrecked lives.' Yipiii founder Chistoph Klingler, an Austrian businessman, told The Mail on Sunday he thought his scheme would work well in this country because the British are 'confident' with online shopping and 'love a flutter'. His company is run from an office in the Maltese capital, Valletta, and is not subject to UK regulation or supervision. It is licensed by only one body, the Lotteries and Gaming Authority of Malta, and, as a foreign firm, does  not have to register with Britain's Gambling Commission – although  proposals to close that loophole were announced in the Queen's Speech. A Gambling Commission spokesman confirmed: 'You do not need a licence from us to run a remote gambling service if all of your remote gambling equipment is located outside Britain.' Psychologist Kim Stephenson, who has written a book on the psychology of saving and spending, said: 'Over time, you cannot win. All you can be certain of is that you will get less back than you paid in. That is the essence of the bet. 'Sites such as these promote the idea that gambling is acceptable and that the expectation of getting something for nothing is a normal way of life.' Yipiii users are encouraged to keep gambling by a variety of incentives, including the promise of discounts on future purchases and special offers  of free spins of the roulette wheel. Another ruse to keep customers on the site as long as possible is to compensate for a failed bet by offering free entry to online competitions. Shoppers are automatically logged off . after an hour as a safeguard against overspending, though there is . nothing to stop them logging on again straight away. The . Yipiii website says players must be 18 or over but customers are . required only to tick a box confirming their age. If they win a prize, . however, they are asked to send  a photocopy of their passport or . driving licence to obtain the item. Players can top up their account by up to £50 a time, up to £200 day. British retailers have become . increasingly keen on using affiliate websites, such as Yipiii, to . attract new customers. An industry source explained: 'There are salesmen . out there whose job is to target fledgling websites and link them up to . established brands. Either Yipiii did not disclose that it was a gaming . site or the stores did not bother to check.' When . a Mail on Sunday reporter visited Yipiii's registered address – a . first-floor office just off Freedom Square in the centre of Valletta – . the receptionist said she had never heard of the company but would make . inquiries through another firm, called Evolve. A . man who claimed to represent Evolve then told our reporter to leave the . building, saying: 'OK, enough now. Can you leave? It's  private . property.' Last night Mr . Klingler admitted he had never struck any deals directly with the . British stores, despite describing them on his website as 'trusted . partners'. He said: 'Yipiii is here to benefit British consumers, not mislead them in any way. 'We . are incredibly transparent about our model and we believe it is the . first of its kind. We have all sorts of processes in place that ensure . people cannot use the site irresponsibly. For example, there are maximum . amounts that they can credit to their account at any one time and . alerts if they have been on the site for a specific period of time.' Mr . Klingler said the decision to base the business in Malta had  nothing . to do with reducing tax  liability but because 'the process  for setting . up a licensed gaming business is much faster there' – and regulators . were 'genuinely interested' in licensing his business.  Last night . several retailers said they were launching their own inquiries following . The Mail on  Sunday's investigation. Marks and Spencer said: 'M&S has taken action to withdraw from the Yipiii service.' Asda said: 'Having reviewed the nature of the site we have taken  the decision to remove it from our affiliate programme'. Debenhams said: 'Once we were made aware of how this affiliate operated, we ended the arrangement.' Comet said: 'Our legal team is  contacting the administrator [of the Yipiii website] to request our logo is removed.' Sainsbury's said: 'We have asked that our name is removed immediately.' Boots said: 'We have suspended the account with Yipiii pending further investigation.' Selfridges . said: 'We closely monitor the internet for inappropriate brand . associations such as gambling sites and take action when required.' B&Q said: 'We are looking into this.' An earlier version of this article said Mail on Sunday reporters had spent £162 on Yipiii plays but won only a £20 toy goldfish bowl. In fact, one reporter used ‘free plays’ acquired during the experiment and went on to win an iPad worth up to £400. And in a different experiment another journalist spent £40 and won £35 of flowers and a £101 iPod Nano. We apologise to Yipiii for not mentioning these. Also, we said customers can top up their accounts as often as they like. In fact, top-ups are limited to £200 per day.","Customers encouraged not to pay for shopping but to gamble to win it .

Fraud mastermind: Jay Moore, 21, sold on credit card details, allowing criminals to defraud unsuspecting internet users in frauds which cost £27million . A 21-year-old computer hacker has been jailed for three years for masterminding  a scam which enabled £27million of fraud to be committed. Jay Moore set up fake shopping website Freshshop to ‘farm’ credit card data from unsuspecting users, which he then sold to international criminal gangs. He also hacked into payment systems to obtain databases of card information which he sold in bulk through his website. Detectives later found the card details of more than 340,000 individuals on his home computer and £81,000 of cash in a safe in his bedroom. Moore spent his money on a top-of-the-range BMW with a personalised number plate valued at over £10,000, and gave £40,000 to his father to help buy a large farmhouse. Banks reported fraudulent losses linked to cards in excess of £26.9million. Moore, who has no formal qualifications, pleaded guilty to 12 charges of fraud, money laundering and computer misuse at Bristol Crown Court. His accomplice Damian Horne, 22, who used his personal bank account to collect criminal funds received through the website, was jailed for 21 months. The court heard how Moore, of Cromhall, Gloucestershire, met Horne, of Manchester, in an online chatroom for hackers. Together they began selling stolen iTunes vouchers on eBay. But their criminal enterprises soon . escalated into credit card data and they began laundering the proceeds . through a network of bank  accounts, online financial institutions and . overseas money exchangers. Fraud HQ: Jay Moore, 21, set up his fake shopping website from this home in Cromhall, Gloucestershire. When police raided the property they discovered £81,000 stashed in a bedroom safe . Freshshop appeared like any other . retail site and Moore allowed other hackers to sell their stolen data . through him for a commission. Moore paid two of his friends, Lewis . Danter, 20, and John Allen, 22, to collect cash from outlets which had . been wired over from international criminals as payment for the illicit . card data. Meanwhile, Horne would post bundles . of cash to Moore. When Moore was arrested at his  parents’ home he had . almost £81,000 of cash in a bedroom safe and more than £170,000 in his . bank account. He lied to friends and family, telling them he operated a web design business. Danter and Allen, both of Bristol, . pleaded guilty to money laundering and were each sentenced to 120 hours . of community service. A spokesman for the Serious Organised Crime Agency said: ‘The sale of this compromised data earned Moore substantial profits. ‘In addition to the fraud attributed . to specific cards, the information brokered by Moore would also have . been sufficient to enable fake bank accounts to be set up. ‘These could in turn be used to commit further fraud, such as cheque or identity fraud.’","Jay Moore, 21, acted as the middleman selling stolen credit card details through his website Freshshop .

He was a child actor with a promising future, winning plaudits 12 years ago for his portrayal of an emotionally disturbed boy whose destructive behaviour tormented his family. But Eric Byrne is today beginning a jail sentence for burglary and theft after his life took a similar path to that of the character he played on television. Byrne appeared alongside stars including Ross Kemp, Lee Evans and Kathy Burke but sank into debt after becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol. The 24-year-old, who starred in television dramas Holby City and Kid in the Corner as well as movie The Martins, was jailed for 15 months by a judge at Bristol Crown Court. Squandered talent: Eric Byrne (left), who has been jailed for burglary and theft, played an emotionally disturbed boy in the critically-acclaimed television drama Kid in the Corner (right) Judge Carol Hagen heard how Byrne had squandered a promising talent, eventually stealing from friends and burgling a house in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, to pay for his addictions. One of his victims was a woman who had helped find him a flat to live in. Byrne came to prominence in 1999 when he starred in Kid in the Corner, a Channel 4 drama which received award nominations. He played Danny Letts, an emotionally disturbed boy who was given therapy and prescription drugs in an attempt to combat his destructive behaviour. Byrne's on-screen sister was played by former EastEnders star Brooke Kinsella, who has become a prominent anti-knife campaigner since the murder of her half-brother Ben in 2008. In 2000 Byrne played a villager in comedy Garage: A Rock Saga, starring former Cheers actor George Wendt, and appeared in made-for-television movie The Sleeper. Child star: Byrne (pictured in the foreground) appeared with Terri Dumont, Linda Bassett, Kathy Burke and Lee Evans in the film The Martins . He also starred in the television version of A Christmas Carol, with ex-soap actor Ross Kemp. Byrne played a dysfunctional child in The Martins, a comedy with a cast led by Kathy Burke and Lee Evans. He next appeared alongside veteran British actor George Cole, the star of popular television series Minder, in TV railway film 'Station Jim'. His final performance on television came in 2002 when he appeared as character Glen Hale in an episode of medical drama Holby City. Difficult: Byrne's character in Kid in the Corner, Danny Letts, was given therapy and prescription drugs in an attempt to curb his destructive behaviour . Actresses Tina Hobley and Luisa Bradshaw-White also appeared in the programme. Trouble began when Byrne left acting and a once-promising football career, which involved training with West Ham United's youth academy, petered out. In December last year, Byrne stole £300 from friend Ben Tarr after he stayed with him following a night out. Troubled: The court heard that Byrne, pictured in Kid in the Corner broke up with his circus worker girlfriend and his life spiralled out of control . Robert Reed, prosecuting, told the court Mr Tarr had slept with his wallet under his pillow, but recalled being woken during the night by Byrne, who was heading out again. 'Only the following morning did the victim realise what had happened,' Mr Reed said. 'The wallet had been removed along with £300 in cash.' Byrne later agreed to pay the money back by New Year's Eve. Mr Reed told the court that Byrne called Mr Tarr that night and told him he had left four televisions in his van to replace the money. But the televisions were linked to a burglary at the home of Natalie Days - who had previously helped Byrne find accommodation in a flat below hers. Jewellery, watches and clothes were also stolen in the raid. Ms Days's insurance company paid out £20,000 but many items are still missing. Byrne fled to Hertfordshire, where he was arrested on May 14 after handing himself in to police. Nicholas Fridd, defending, told the court that Byrne's life had spiralled after he broke up with his girlfriend, a circus worker. He said: 'That's when things went wrong for Byrne with drink and drugs. 'He is ashamed of what he did as he breached trust and friendship to steal.' The judge told Byrne his actions had been 'particularly mean' as he had breached the trust of a woman who had helped him.

German neo-Nazis helped Palestinian terrorists kill 11 Israeli athletes during the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, newly released intelligence files reveal. Abu Daoud, who is believed to the mastermind of the atrocity, met fascist Willi Pohl in Dortmund, according to a city police dossier kept secret for 40 years. But despite the file being passed on to the German federal intelligence agency, Verfassungsschutz, there is no evidence that they acted upon the 2,000-page report. Chilling: One of the terrorists wearing a ski mask on the balcony outside the Israeli contingent's apartment . Tragic: A combination photograph shows the 11 Israeli athletes and coaches who were killed in Munich . And this lack of action allowed Daoud, who is named in the police report as his alias Saad Walli, to travel the country to meet fellow terrorists and plan the attack. Pohl, who is now a crime fiction author, told magazine Der Spiegel: ‘I chauffeured Abu Daoud through the entire Federal Republic where he met in different cities with Palestinians.’ The 68-year-old, who insists he had no idea the group were planning the attack, claims he unwittingly also helped Daoud obtain false passports and other documents. Helped by fascists: Mastermind Abu Daoud was driven around the country by Willi Pohl, who also helped procure false documents, intelligence files reveal . But Pohl allegedly later bragged to his employer about his contact with the extremist wing of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, according to the report. Pohl, who spoke on the condition that he was not photographed, was later asked by the PLO's leadership to carry out vengeance attacks for the police killings of five militants, the files say. Several possible attacks were considered, including a hostage-taking at the cathedral in Cologne, it was claimed. But he was arrested in Munich in October 1972 and later jailed for two years for possession of illegal weapons. Police . found he had hand grenades, firearms and a threatening letter from . Black September addressed to a judge who was preparing to bring charges . against Palestinians involved in the Munich massacre. The documents also . suggested Pohl helped to procure weapons that may have been used in the . atrocity itself. Black . September had used the same sort of grenades - made in Belgium from . Swedish explosives - to kill the Israeli hostages, the files show. Daoud, whose real name was Mohammed Daoud Odeh, died in July 2010 aged 73. He claimed responsibility for the attack in his book Palestine, from Jerusalem to Munich, published in 1999. He defended the act as a military operation against athletes who were military reservists. Blood and bullet holes cover the floor and walls where one of the two Israeli killed in their apartment was murdered . Failure: Armed police drop into position on a terrace directly above the apartments. But they did not try and rescue the hostages . Defeat: The burned wreckage of the helicopter in which nine Israelis held hostage were killed after a botched rescue mission . It . began on the morning of September 5, 1972, with six days left in the . Games, when eight terrorists stormed the Olympic village and raided the . Israeli contingent’s apartment. Two Israeli athletes were killed and nine more were seized as hostages. They demanded the release of over 200 Palestinians serving time in Israeli jails, along with two renowned German terrorists. After a day of unsuccessful negotiations, the terrorists collected the hostages and headed for the military airport in Munich for a flight back to the Middle East. At the airport, German sharpshooters opened fire, killing three of the Palestinians . Thugs: Neo-Nazis marching on German streets . A horrifying gun battle ensued, claiming the lives of all nine of the hostages and two terrorists on board a helicopter.

Among a rapidly dwindling band, no one epitomises the courage and heroism of the Bomber Command veterans more than Freddie 'Johnny' Johnson. A survivor of 92 missions during five years of service in the Second World War, the highly decorated rear gunner was shot down twice – once behind enemy lines – but lived to fight another day. Now aged 91 and a wheelchair user, he could have expected to be a VIP guest at the unveiling of a long-awaited £6.5million Bomber Command memorial in Green Park in central London. War hero: Rear gunner Freddie Johnson, 91, who has been denied a ticket to the unveiling of the £6.5million bomber command memorial . But despite his distinguished service . and years of work helping to raise money for the memorial appeal, Mr . Johnson has been told he cannot attend the ceremony on June 28 because . there are no tickets left. The memorial, a sculpture which features seven bomber air crew members, is expected to be unveiled by the Queen. It is seen as overdue recognition for . the bomber crews whose place in history has been widely played down . because of the high number of civilian deaths they caused. Mr Johnson's family are furious about . the snub. They found out too late that veterans had to apply for . tickets, like anyone else wanting to attend. Now the entire allocation has been . taken up, largely by relatives of those who served on the bombers, and . Mr Johnson has been told he can't go. His daughter Mandy Stewart, 56, said: 'How can they expect a 91-year-old war veteran to sort this out himself?

'He's a member of the RAF Association so it couldn't have been that hard to trace him and invite him to the ceremony. 'We feel that precedence should be given to those who were actually there.' Mr Johnson, of Tadcaster, North . Yorkshire, supported numerous fundraising events over the years which . finally led to the memorial being given the go ahead. He said: 'I would have loved to have gone. I was very pleased when I heard it was being built.' Like many other veterans he was determined that the 55,573 bomber crew who lost their lives should be given a fitting memorial. Mr Johnson was 20 when he joined the . RAF. As a rear gunner he had a life expectancy of six weeks, but went on . to survive the entire war and earn six medals, including the . Distinguished Flying Cross, in the process. Tribute: Mr Johnson has raised funds for the £6.5million Bomber Command memorial in Green Park, London . There were 25 missions over Germany, as well as stints in Burma and North Africa in Wellington and Halifax bombers. Mr Johnson's closest shave came at El . Alamein in 1942 when his plane was shot down. He survived by a stroke of . luck when the turret of his plane where he was sitting came away as the . aircraft crashed into the desert. The front end of the plane exploded, . killing four men on board, but he survived. Despite being behind enemy lines he . marched off into the desert  and was picked up by a group of British . soldiers who had spotted the crash. Decorated: Freddie was involved in 91 bombing raids during the war - and survived being shot down twice . A second crash occurred when his plane . was shot down near the Burma border, and on this occasion everyone . survived. The rear gunner badly damaged his leg in another operation and . was in hospital when his medal and letter from the King arrived. He . still has pins in his legs and suffers severe arthritis. He remains fiercely proud of his war years and his wife Jean, 85, believes the authorities have let him down. She said: 'It's a shame. He is . bitterly disappointed. There can't be that many veterans left who saw . such long service and were presented with so many medals. This memorial . is what my husband has been waiting for. At one point in the war the . bombers were all we had. The bombers deserve this.' The memorial organisers said that they . were extremely sorry that Mr Johnson and other veterans had been unable . to get tickets to the event. A spokesman said: 'The problem is we . have been absolutely overwhelmed by demand for tickets. We have a . licence limiting us to 6,500 guests which we cannot exceed, and have . prioritised two groups – people who lost relatives such as husbands and . fathers, and veterans who flew in the planes. 'But we still probably have at least . 1,000 people who would like to attend but cannot come. Other events will . be staged at the memorial later in the year and we would hope that . people who cannot get a ticket this time will be able to attend one of . those functions.'","War Hero Freddie Johnson, 91, won six medals during the war .

The threat many families face of losing their home has been . starkly highlighted, as the towns and cities most at risk are revealed. The list shows the risk is spread across England, and not . just confined to the north of the country where public sector austerity and . weak economic growth has hit areas hard. The hot spot table shows homeowners in London and the east of England are also . struggling to keep up with mortgage payments and are issued repossession warnings. But a separate study . showed that those in the south of the country were more likely to survive from the repossession claim, and cling on to their home. Housing charity Shelter compiled the list of possession claims . using figures recorded by the Ministry of Justice. A possession claim is the . first step in a property being taking away from its owner, though not all cases . end in repossession. New figures obtained by housing charity Shelter show the risk of repossession is spread across the country . Topping the bleak list is Barking and Dagenham in London, . where more than twice as many homes face repossession as the national average - as many as eight in every 1,000 properties. Knowsley in the North West and Thurrock in the East of . England followed closely behind the top two, while Lewisham in south London and . Rossendale, also in the North West, came in at fourth and fifth place . respectively. Chief executive of Shelter, Campbell Robb, said: ‘Most . people think that repossession will never happen to them, but rising . unemployment, rising living costs and high house prices mean that many people . are living close to the edge already, and risk falling into a spiral of debt . and repossession. ‘The journey from being a homeowner to becoming homeless is . frighteningly swift, with just one small thing like a wage cut, a health . problem or a job loss meaning that a family can no longer meet their mortgage . payments. This map shows the area most at risk of repossession claims, based on government data . 'When repossession happens, the impact on families is . devastating - research shows people think repossession is worse than having to . fight a child custody battle.' However, further research shows that those in the north of . the country are less likely to survive the risk, and will lose their homes. An analysis of court-ordered repossessions in the second . half of 2011, by chartered surveyors e.surv, found that the North East and the . M62 corridor were the regions where repossessions are rife. Richard Sexton, business development director of e.surv, . said: ‘Spending cuts, negative real wage growth, falling house prices and . public sector unemployment have hit the North much harder than the South. 'This has opened up a gaping geographical divide in . repossessions levels.’ Researchers said they found a strong link between rising . unemployment and repossession claims, with the towns and cities facing the . highest risk also suffering a faster rate of unemployment . Housing minister Grant Shapps said he is determined to help people facing the frightening possibility of loosing their home . As well as facing tougher criteria to take out a mortgage, . borrowers have also been hit by a steady rise in rates for new mortgages in . recent months, despite record low interest rates, as lenders deal with the . increased cost of funding a mortgage amid the weak economy and the ongoing . eurozone crisis. More than a million existing mortgage borrowers also saw . their rates rise last month as a string of lenders put them up. Mr Robb added: ‘Housing is the largest monthly cost for many . homeowners, yet the affordability of housing is not getting the same government . attention as the monthly costs of other essentials such as food or energy . bills.’ He said those struggling with mortgage arrears should . contact their mortgage provider to avoid repossession and seek advice from . bodies such as Shelter. Housing Minister Grant Shapps said: ‘By tackling the record . deficit we inherited we’ve prevented the need for rapid rises in interest rates . that would have put pressure on hard-working families, meaning repossessions . are at their lowest level since 2007. ‘But I’m determined that help is available to those facing . the real and frightening prospect of losing their home. ‘That’s why I’ve given £19 million to councils so they can . offer short-term loans to struggling homeowners, and over £3 million to the . National Homelessness Advisory Service, run by Shelter and Citizens Advice, to . ensure help is on hand to families when they need it most. ‘Like Shelter, I would urge anyone struggling with their . mortgage to seek early help, so that repossession is always the last resort.” The table shows the areas suffering from the highest repossession rate.

The start of the Great British summer might typically see people seek shelter from the sunshine. But in one of the wettest, coldest and dullest June's since records began, taking refuge under a sink from yet another downpour was all part of the start of summer for youngsters attending a Gloucestershire show. And elsewhere, the story wasn't much different as storms and hailstones as big as golf balls were all scenes which unfolded due to June's unseasonable weather. 'Mum, can we go home now? Two youngsters shelter from the torrential downpour at the fair in Gloucestershire . Visitors to the Cotswold Show in Gloucester today had to put up with the unseasonal conditions for June . Average rainfall over England and Wales, . including an estimated figure for today, was 157mm - more than twice . the average for the period between 1981-2010. The wettest June recorded previously was in 2007 when there were heavy floods in the north of the country. Previously, the second wettest June was . in 1912 and the Met Office said that we have already far surpassed the . amount of rain that fell in that month. The equivalent figures for Scotland were 104mm and 171% of the normal amount of rainfall, and for 145mm, which is twice the typical amount expected in Northern Ireland. As well as being amongst the wettest Junes on record, the month has also been one of the dullest . Intense downpours have plagued much of the country as the unseasonal conditions have taken hold . It has already been confirmed that this month has been the wettest June in Wales. June 2012 was also the dullest since 1909 and the coldest since 1991. Average sunshine over England and Wales, including an estimated figure for June 30, was 123 hours, which is a mere 64% of the 1981-2010 average.. In Scotland, there were 123 hours of sunshine and in Northern Ireland, an unseasonable 136 hours. And it doesn't look like the start of July will be much better as Chris Burton, of forecasters Meteogroup, said: ‘Next week looks unsettled again with lots of wet weather around.’ The torrential rain and fierce storms have been put down to a weather phenomenon known as the Spanish plume, forecasters said. The pattern occurs when warm, moist air sweeping up from the south is lifted by a cold weather front from the west bringing prolonged and exceptionally intense downpours. Riding the wave: A wave of flood water hits a police 4X4 as it struggles to drive through flooded streets in Gateshead . Hail: The ground looks like it is covered in snow in Queniborough, Leicestershire, following a storm earlier this week . Paul Knightley, senior forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: 'It is a pattern that when it sets up in the correct fashion will produce spectacular thunder storms.' The Spanish plume was behind three . rare 'super cell' thunderstorms that swept across the Midlands this week . bringing hailstones the size of golf balls in some areas. The Godiva Festival due to take place in Coventry's War Memorial Park over the weekend that was expected to attract more than 100,000 revelers has been cancelled due to the heavy rain. Elsewhere, swathes of the Midlands were hit by . intense downpours, with some parts receiving almost an inch of . rain in just an hour - a third of the average rainfall for the whole . month of June. A flash thunderstorm in Newcastle-upon-Tyne this week turned the roads into rivers . Many homeowners were forced to remove ruined furniture from their homes after flash floods . Water, water everywhere: June 2012 looks set to be one of the wettest on record . The dreadful weather this month also caused transport headaches for thousands. A landslide caused by a torrential downpour led to a freight train derailing, blocking the West Highland railway line. The 24-wagon train came off the tracks between Corrour and Tulloch on the 28th June as a result of a huge influx of rain. The final figures for this month's rainfall will not be released until June 2nd by the Met Office, but it is anticipated that rainfall will be amongst the highest ever for the month. 186.3mm of rain fell in the country beating the previous highest amount of rainfall for June - 183.1mm - which had been set in 1998. A store owner in Durham tries to put his livelihood back together after heavy rainfall caused severe flooding . A landslip on the East Coast Main Line in Scremerston, near Berwick, caused chaos for travelers . Many rail passengers had their journeys disrupted due to adverse weather conditions more typical of other times in the year . As well as having to put up with a higher than average amount of rain, people looking forward to enjoying the sun have also been disappointed this month. Temperatures have been below average, with a mean temperature of 11.9c - 0.7c below average for June, and the Central England Temperature of 13.6C (56F) was 0.9 degree Celsius below the average for 1981-2010 - the lowest in June since 1991. As well as the Spanish Plume, one of the main factors behind the dull weather so far this month has been the position of the jet stream, which has been much further south than usual. This has led to low pressure systems ending up close to the UK for almost the whole month. Despite the mostly dreadful weather this month, however, June appeared to end with a slight and brief spell of more typical conditions for the month. Yesterday saw a patch of hot and humid air pushed up into the country from Spain, which led to warm and muggy conditions. The temperature in St James's Park in central London even reached 28.4c. Typically, the sunshine did not last in many parts of the country, though, and there were thunderstorms across the UK. Northern Ireland and Scotland were worst affected by the sudden downpours and a staggering 1,000 lightning strokes hit the UK during a five minute period yesterday.","The Environment Agency confirmed that the period from April to June had been the wettest since records began .

Patrick Ribbsaeter, 32, is accused of repeatedly hitting Wachiraporn Sara-Pod in the face during their two-hour journey home from the 'Killing Kittens' event in London's West End, leaving her  struggling to see. But Ribbsaeter denied he was responsible for causing her injuries and said she was making up the accusation out of spite, claiming that he had no reason to be angry with her . He told the court: 'It was a sex party, everyone's having sex everywhere with everyone. I had nothing to be angry about.' Defence: Patrick Ribbsaeter (left) told the Old Bailey that he only slapped Wachiraporn Sara-Pod (right) because she was 'wasted' on drugs . Miss Sara-Pod claims she was forced . to jump out of the car wearing only a fur coat after he told her: 'I'm . going to hit you until you cannot remember your name.' The Old Bailey heard the Thai woman . was hardly able to see out of one eye and had a blood streaming down her . face when she sought help from a mechanic. But Ribbsaeter  claimed they must have been inflicted by two men Miss Sara-Pod went with to another party in Forest Hill south London. He told jurors: 'She was doing coke in the car and she wanted to go to the party. I didn't feel like partying. 'I go to eat something at a chicken . shop in the same area and then go back home. They seemed like normal . guys, party people like you might see clubbing.' Ribbsaeter described Miss Sara-Pod's claims that he hit her repeatedly in the back of his car as 'complete lies'. 'I feel sad for her, what happened to her. I would never do that to her.' Asked why she would make it up, he . said: 'I don't know why she is so angry. My lifestyle, I was around with . girls, sometimes when I go to my events if I don't invite her she . questions me. 'If I do she gets angry asking who is this girl. She's very very possessive.' On trial: Ribbsaeter, 32, is accused of beating his girlfriend repeatedly, forcing her to flee her car wearing just a fur coat . Ribbsaeter said he told one of their mutual friends that he wanted to break up with Miss Sara-Pod. 'I just said I don't want anything to . do with her, it's finished. I feel sad for her but I can't do things I . want to, she's possessive, it's affecting what I do, my work. We have . been on and off, this time that's it.' Prosecutor Camilla De Silva said in her closing speech that Ribbsaeter's story of the two men was 'unbelievable'. She told the jury he made up the story in a bid to 'cover his tracks'. 'The two men are a fiction. We say . you can be sure that Miss Sara-Pod is an honest witness. You might think . she was a young vulnerable woman in love with Mr Ribbsaeter. 'She spent her whole time trying to placate him. What happened was he assaulted her. 'She has been punched and beaten repeatedly for about three hours by her boyfriend. ' Ribbsaeter's defence barrister Safora Syed suggested that he had been falsely accused by Miss Sara-Pod. 'Hell hath no fury like a woman . scorned is a saying that has applies to this case. She was very angry . and she was very jealous and she could not control her emotions. 'Today Mr Ribbsaeter is paying the price for rejecting Miss Sara-Pod by sitting in the dock. 'She is feeling rejected, deprived of the attention she desperate wanted from him, of course she is going to be angry. ' In cross-examination Ribbsaeter . admitted he had repeatedly lied to police during his first interview . when he claimed he went home in a taxi without his girlfriend. He said: 'That's because I'm not allowed to drive, I'm disqualified to drive.' But Ribbsaeter said he did not have any problem with his girlfriend having sex with someone else at the event. But . he told the court he was 'surprised' that she sent him a text message . asking where he was and saying she would have sex with someone if he did . not turn up. Evidence: Patrick Ribbsaeter, pictured in a 2006 promotion for animal rights organisation PETA with a model unrelated to the case, told the court he lived life 'in the fast lane' Ribbsaeter . said: ‘I go to look for her on the fourth floor. I wanted to use the . toilet and I hear a girl, I could recognise the voice, it sounded like . Anna. ‘A man opened the door and he was standing there in his boxers, with his pants down. Anna was leaning against the wall. ‘I was worried because I see her, she was wasted, she was gone. I took her out to the sofa.’ Ribbsaeter . left her there and went to the British Luxury Club in Mayfair with a . friend but arranged to meet his girlfriend back at the car in Chinatown . later that morning. He said: ‘She was very hyper. She slapped me in the face and said “Why did you leave me at the party?” ‘I told her “Get a hold of yourself” and I slapped her. It was not like to hurt her, it was like get a grip. ‘She stumbled back. I said “Anna get a grip on yourself” and slapped her... It’s hard to explain what she’s like on cocaine.’ Ribbsaeter admits that he slapped his girlfriend twice when she became hysterical in the car park in Chinatown at around 6.30am. 'She was very high on cocaine, she . was wired. She punched me. I did not assault her. I tried to shake her . up, I just tried to get her attention.' Two men who saw the slap and ran over to punch Ribbsaeter in the face, the court heard. ‘I was upset she had put me in this situation,’ he added. Ribbsaeter, of Streatham, south London, denies grievous bodily harm. The judge, Richard Hone QC, told the jury he would sum up the evidence and send them out to consider their verdict on Monday.

The former public schoolboy choked Emily after seeing pictures of her posing with two topless men for a modelling assignment. He pushed her head so hard into a pillow he left it with a ‘face mask’ indentation. When Turner’s parents woke the next morning they found their son – who was obsessed by gangsters – had packed his bags ready to flee to Spain. But former jeweller Mr Turner, 54, and his Indonesian-born wife Anita, 51, convinced him to stay and concocted a story claiming Emily had died in her sleep. It was only after police bugged their home in Bournemouth that the Turners were heard talking about destroying the letter of confession with bleach. The court heard how Mrs Turner had held ‘Support Elliot’ parties for her son while detectives were still investigating the death at their home in May last year. Model: The picture of Emily Longley that led to her death . During more than 291 hours of covert recordings, Elliot Turner was heard discussing the night of the murder with his parents and claiming that he had ‘just lost it’. Police scans of a computer seized from their home found Google searches for ‘death by strangulation’ and ‘how to get out of being charged for murder’. On the recordings, Mr Turner is heard asking his wife if she thought they were right to destroy the letter, saying: ‘We’ve perverted the course of justice, we’ve destroyed the vital evidence in this case.’ Mrs Turner is heard to reply: ‘Yes because he is our son, we’ve done the right thing.’ Mr Turner is later heard telling his wife: ‘Stop denying it. He ****ing strangled her.’ Guilty: Elliot Turner (left) strangled Miss Emily (right) in his bedroom during a drunken argument . Unhappy couple: Elliot Turner and Emily Longley, pictured in the days before her death . Emily's parents Caroline and Mark. Caroline said that Turner saw Emily as 'a trophy adorned on his arm' 'That light has been extinguished suddenly and needlessly by you. Fern Russell, representing Mrs Turner, said: ‘She is a mother who couldn’t accept that her son had committed the worst imaginable crime and it was in that turmoil that she carried out that act. ‘In her mind she wasn’t concealing a murder but at worst was buying time for her son to explain himself.’ But in her sentencing Mrs Justice Dobbs said: ‘The destruction of a confession to a killing is a very serious matter indeed. ‘Despite the strength of evidence against you, the two of you chose to fight the case showing little remorse for what you had done.’ Speaking outside court, Emily’s grandfather, Ron Longley, said: ‘We are satisfied with the sentence, we feel it was balanced and just. A year ago, Mr and Mrs Turner’s son murdered our lovely, shining Emily.’ When asked if he believed his family had received justice, Mr Longley added: ‘In law certainly. Morally, in terms of life, we can’t feel that anything has been made fair.’ Flowers were left at the scene following the death of Emily Longley, pictured on a night out .","Elliot Turner, 20, murdered 17-year-old .

Christian of Twickenham, south-west London, was sent home after refusing . to remove or hide a necklace with a cross. An employment tribunal ruled she had . not suffered religious discrimination, but the airline changed its . uniform policy after the case to allow all religious symbols, including . crosses. Miss Eweida has pursued the case, however, to try to establish . in law the rights of other religious people.

Exit: Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown leaves the Leveson Inquiry at the High Court in London after a controversial morning of evidence . Gordon Brown yesterday accused Rupert . Murdoch of lying on oath in his claim to the Leveson Inquiry that the . former prime minister ‘declared war’ on his media empire. Mr Brown said an alleged ‘unbalanced’ phone call the tycoon claimed was made after The Sun switched its . backing to the Tories did not take place. ‘This call did not happen. The threat was not made. I find it shocking. There is no evidence that it happened,’ he said. In a statement issued last night by . News Corporation, Mr Murdoch stood by his evidence. But in extraordinary . testimony to the judicial inquiry into media standards, Mr Brown also . insisted he did not give consent for The Sun to publish a story about . his son’s diagnosis with cystic fibrosis. He said he was ‘shocked and surprised’ that Mr Murdoch had told the inquiry he had said that in allowing his . newspaper to support the Tories, he had ‘declared war on the . government’, leaving him ‘no alternative but to declare war on your . company’. Mr Brown rejected evidence from the . newspaper’s former editor Rebekah Brooks that he and wife Sarah had . agreed to the publication of details of the illness of their son, . Fraser, though he appeared to accept that it was not obtained by . accessing his medical records as previously claimed. And he accused The Sun of distorting . reports on the war on Afghanistan to make it appear that he had ‘evil . intentions’ and did not care about British troops. Mr Brown’s claims are serious because they charge Mr Murdoch and Mrs Brooks of not telling the truth at the inquiry. Witnesses must swear on oath to give truthful evidence, and could be charged with perjury if they have not done so. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Evidence: Gordon Brown has started giving evidence this morning as he was drawn into the Leveson firestorm . Under oath: Mr Brown has made several sensational claims today in his evidence and denied much of Rupert Murdoch's evidence was true . Battle: Gordon Brown and Rupert Murdoch have been engaged in an incredible war of words with the former Prime Minister accused of making a 'threatening' phone call to the media mogul when The Sun dropped support for Labour in 2009 . The former PM’s evidence was his first . major public appearance since he spoke in the Commons a year ago to . attack the ‘criminal-media nexus’ he said had been created by the . Murdoch empire. A defiant Mr Brown appeared determined . to contradict Mr Murdoch’s evidence in which the former prime minister . was alleged to have vowed to go to war with his company. ‘I am alleged to have acted in an . unbalanced way. This conversation never took place. I am shocked and . surprised that it should be suggested,’ Mr Brown said. He said he had spoken to Mr Murdoch . weeks after The Sun’s switch to the Tories in 2009, but the conversation . was about Afghanistan. In her evidence, Mrs Brooks told the . inquiry that Mr Brown had been ‘extraordinarily aggressive’ in response . to The Sun’s coverage of the conflict. But the former PM dismissed that . claim. Big day: Gordon Brown with his wife Sarah arrive at a rain-soaked Royal Courts of Justice this morning . Off to work: Mr and Mrs Brown head into the Leveson Inquiry where the former Prime Minister will be grilled on his dealings with the Murdoch Empire . He also denounced claims in The Sun . that he fell asleep at a memorial service, insisting he was bowing his . head to pray, and also attacked its coverage of a letter he sent to the . mother of a dead soldier that was said to have contained 25 mistakes. He added that he felt he did not have the support of The Sun ‘for almost all the time that I was prime minister. 'You have to remember that when I . started off as prime minister, the first thing The Sun did was try to . ruin my first party conference by launching their huge campaign about . how we were selling Britain down the river and demanding not only a . European referendum but demanding that I support it,’ he said. Exit: Gordon Brown, pictured with his wife and boys when he left Downing Street in 2009, says he had tried to protect his children from the media . Angry: Then PM Gordon Brown arrives at the Showal forward operating base in Lashkar Gah, southern Afghanistan in 2010, and attacked the Sun on its coverage on the issue . Cosy relationship: Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah with Rupert Murdoch and his wife Wendi shortly after Mr Brown became Prime Minister in 2007, but their relationship eventually turned sour . An emotional Mr Brown also rejected . Mrs Brooks’s evidence that he and his wife gave permission for the paper . to reveal that their son Fraser had cystic fibrosis. ‘I don’t think there’s any parent in . the land who would have given explicit permission for this story,’ he . said. Mr Brown sought to undermine The Sun’s evidence that the story was . obtained legitimately. He cited a statement from John . Wilson, chief executive of NHS Fife, who said they accepted that a . member of its staff had spoken, without authorisation, about Fraser’s . medical condition. Mr Wilson also insisted ‘there was no inappropriate access to the child’s medical records’. Mr Brown struggled to explain why he and his wife continued to socialise with Mrs Brooks after the story was published. Big smile: Rupert Murdoch is driven away with his wife Wendi after giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry in April. Wendi went to a Pyjama party at Chequers with Sarah Brown . Mrs Brown held a slumber party to mark . Mrs Brooks’ 40th birthday at Chequers at which Rupert Murdoch’s wife . Wendi was also present. The Browns also attended Mrs Brooks’ wedding. ‘Sarah is one of the most forgiving people I know,’ Mr Brown said. ‘We had to get on with the job of doing what is expected.’ Responding to Mr Brown’s evidence, a News Corporation spokesman said: ‘Rupert Murdoch stands behind his testimony.’ A News International spokesman said: . ‘We welcome the fact that NHS Fife have today said that they believe . there was ‘no inappropriate access’ to the medical records of Gordon .

The Leveson Inquiry was repeatedly told by Mr Brown that he knew nothing about his aides plotting against Tony Blair and other Cabinet ministers yesterday – sparking incredulity from party insiders. The former PM refused to accept any responsibility for unleashing the ‘forces of hell’ as his spindoctors were dubbed. Mr Blair, Alistair Darling, Alastair Campbell and other leading Labour figures have repeatedly insisted that Mr Brown’s special advisers Charlie Whelan and Damian McBride engaged in aggressive briefings against Mr Brown’s internal enemies. Denial: Gordon Brown told the Inquiry that he never briefed against Tony Blair . The judge chairing the inquiry into press ethics said today that it was 'essential' that cross-party political support for his investigation was 'not jeopardised'. Lord Justice Leveson said the 'politics of personality' and any impact inquiry evidence might have on current political issues was not his focus. The judge told the Leveson Inquiry in London that nothing he said or did was intended to limit any investigation by Parliament. He was speaking prior to hearing evidence from former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown. 'The purpose of the inquiry is not to challenge the present Government or the decisions taken in the recent past but to look at the much wider sweep of history, across party political boundaries,' said Lord Justice Leveson, a Court of Appeal judge. 'To the extent that there are political questions that Parliament wishes to investigate, I repeat that nothing I say or do is intended to limit or prevent that investigation taking place.' But Mr Brown insisted he neither sanctioned nor was even aware of the briefings. Mr Brown dismissed as ‘tittle tattle’ the repeated assertions that Mr Whelan and later Mr McBride engaged in . systematic anonymous briefings against his rivals. ‘I wouldn’t say that . at all,’ he told the inquiry. ‘It would be without my knowledge and . without my sanction.’ Asked if they ever briefed against Mr Blair, he . said simply: ‘No. If they did so it was without my authorisation. Mr Campbell has told the inquiry there was a ‘real problem’ with Mr Brown’s special adviser in the Treasury, Charlie Whelan. Mr Brown’s chancellor, Alistair . Darling, has accused Mr McBride and Mr Whelan, who was by then with the . Unite union, of briefing against him in the financial crash of 2008. ‘The forces of hell were unleashed,’ he said. But Mr Brown said yesterday: ‘One . thing I can say to you that is absolutely clear ... is that nobody in my . position would have instructed any briefing against a senior minister, . and Alastair Darling was a friend of mine as well as a senior . colleague.’ Mr McBride was forced to resign in 2007 after it emerged that he had passed smear stories about senior Tories to a website.","The former PM denied he called Mr Murdoch to threaten him with war after The Sun backed the Tories .

But that dream quickly turned into a nightmare when just 15 minutes after picking up the vessel from a Hampshire boat yard, Mr Ward, 61 and his crew member John Innes were leaping for their lives, their clothes in flames, as the yacht exploded.

He then intends to take further action for damages concerning his injuries and psychiatric damage. Then, as they shivered in a life raft . on a freezing cold February day, they watched in horror as the blazing . boat, by now a ball of fire, sank beneath the waves. The pair were rescued by a lifeboat and rushed to Southampton General Hospital with serious burns. A spokesman for the Coastguard said: . 'When we first saw the boat in flames from our air/sea rescue helicopter . we were convinced nobody could have escaped alive. It is a miracle . anyone survived.' Mr Ward . and his partner Dawn Roads are now suing dealers MGM Marine Ltd, trading . as MGM Boats, and Dun Laoghaire Yacht Services for more than £300,000.

Within a short time the boat was in flames and the men prepared to abandon ship. Mr Ward said: 'I said to John, ""We are going to have to get off here quick"".' By this time the whole of the bottom of the boat was in flames and as Mr Innes was making his way towards the life raft the cockpit canopy exploded showering him with burning plastic and vinyl which set his jacket and hair alight. Mr Ward said: 'I started to beat out the globules of flame stuck to John's hair and clothes - burning my hands quite badly in the process. 'I flung the raft into the water and pulled on the rope to inflate it but by this time the flames were at our backs and my jacket and hair caught fire. 'For ten minutes we were drifting on the raft waiting for the lifeboat to pick us up and we watched the boat sink.' Describing his injuries, Mr Ward said: 'My face was just one huge blister.

Ofsted inspectors have been offered counselling after a 'troubling incident' caused a school inspection to be cut short. The inspectors were asked to leave the renowned Newcastle College - rated one of the top further education institutions in England - after a dispute with teachers over the way the inspection was conducted. The inspection results would currently see the Newcastle College - part of the Newcastle College Group that also incorporates West Lancashire College and Intraining based in Sheffield - downgraded from its outstanding status to good. Chief Executive of Newcastle College Group Dame Jackie Fisher has made an official complaint about 'some troubling incidents' during an Ofsted inspection at Newcastle College . Chief executive of the Newcastle College Group Jackie Fisher - who was made a Dame in 2010 for her outstanding contribution to further education - has now told staff she now plans to challenge Ofsted’s decision. She has formally complained about the behaviour of some inspectors following the visits in May and June. An email to staff said: 'Unfortunately the inspection came to an untimely end as a result of some troubling incidents. 'However, we finally agreed to allow the inspectors to return and the on-site inspection of NCG has now been included.' Renowned: Newcastle College was rated as the number one general further education institution in England earlier this year by the Department for Education . The e-mail from Dame Fisher - who was also awarded a CBE in 2005 - adds: 'Many of you are aware that the Ofsted inspection was not entirely trouble-free. 'We are planning to pursue with Ofsted some outstanding matters which may improve the grade profile. 'However, based on Oftsed’s track record in listening to provider complaints, this must be viewed as unlikely, regardless of how strong our case is.' Chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, introduced a tougher inspection regime for Ofsted . Ofsted’s inspection saw much of the college’s work rated as good rather than outstanding, a move which will come as a blow to a college rated by the Department for Education earlier this year as the number one general further education institution in England for 16 to 18-year-old achievement. Ofsted's inspectors are reportedly now being offered counselling after the incident. NCG has been at the centre of political controversy over the last two years, with Newcastle Council withdrawing co-operation on one of its projects in opposition to NCG’s plan to open a free school. Ministers last week turned down NCG’s plans. A spokesman for NCG said: 'This briefing was a private memo to staff to update them on the inspection. 'We are awaiting the full report from Ofsted. 'However, their provisional findings say several areas of our teaching are outstanding and the majority are good. 'However, we are very concerned with the way the inspection was conducted and there were some troubling incidents which meant the inspection ended before it was complete. 'We agreed inspectors could return to complete the inspection last week. We have officially complained to Ofsted and are awaiting their response. 'It would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.' 'Troubling incident': Ofsted inspectors were asked to leave Newcastle College in the middle of an inspection . An Ofsted spokeswoman said: 'While Ofsted does not comment on individual complaints, we do take complaints very seriously, investigating each one rigorously and dealing with issues as quickly as possible.” Ofsted has introduced a tougher inspection regime under new Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, which makes it harder for schools to make the grade.

Mrs Kennedy was surrounded by relatives on Tuesday night as as she emerged from court in Amonk, New York after entering her not guilty plea. Speaking to reporters she claimed numerous neurological tests show that she suffered a 'partial seizure' which was the result of a previous head injury . She added: 'I want to apologise to the driver of . the truck who I apparently hit and all those who I apparently . endangered,’ ‘A MRI showed an area of hypo-density which appears to be the result of a head injury sustained some time ago,' she said. Kennedy concluded that doctors believe the accident was caused by a partial seizure. She added that this was the only seizure she had ever suffered and would continue to get treatment over 'the months ahead and, perhaps, indefinitely.' Recalling Friday's accident she said, 'I remember getting onto the highway and then I have no memory until I was at a traffic light and a police officer was at my car door.' 'I have never had any history of drug or alcohol abuse and in my discussion with the police officer I was confused and erratic,' she continued. She told the officers that she had possibly mixed up two prescription drugs before getting behind the wheel and taken the sleeping pill Ambien instead of a daily prescription that she takes for a thyroid problem.

Westchester highway before the Lexus slammed into his rig and careered . off the interstate. He told . the New York Post: 'My first impression was that she was really, really . drunk. She's very lucky she didn't kill somebody. 'I’ve been a truck driver for 22 years. I’m pretty sure she was half-asleep or very, very intoxicated. 'She scared the heck out of a lot of people. She was completely out of it.' He told the Post that right before the crash, he saw Kennedy's head drop down to the steering wheel before snapping up again and nodding off again, all while veering in and out of lanes. 'She started . coming at me, like she didn’t see me. She was starting to nod off, . her head was bobbing toward the steering wheel,' he said. 'I hit the horn. I couldn’t go back into . the breakdown lane because there was a disabled truck up ahead. I could . either hit that truck or let her do whatever she was going to do. 'I hit the brakes, but she hit the brakes at the same time and veered right into me. 'When she hit me, my left tire tore up . her passenger-side door. She woke up a little bit, not a lot — not the way you’d wake up if you’d just hit a 6,000-pound truck.' Arrested: Kerry Kennedy has been charged with driving while impaired with drugs in New York . One of the tires on her car came free and shot into oncoming traffic and smoke was pouring out of the Lexus, the truck driver said. Mr Scuitello told the Post he first thought she must be 'really, really . drunk' and recalled when he saw her she looked like she had just rolled . out of bed.

But despite Bradley Wiggins' incredible achievements on the streets of France this summer, a Twitter row involving his wife Catherine and the partner of teammate Chris Froome has exposed rumblings of discontent within the Sky Team camp. In what has been dubbed 'the War of the Wags,' Mr Froome's partner Michelle Cound has Tweeted her disapproval at what she sees as the favourable treatment given to Mr Wiggins at her boyfriend's expense. Michelle Cound (pictured with boyfriend Chris Froome) has taken to Twitter to criticise his treatment during the Tour de France . Catherine Wiggins (pictured with her husband Bradley Wiggins) has clashed with Ms Cound over her tweet . The blonde, South African sports photographer is upset that Kenyan rider Mr Froomes has been forced into a support role for his team captain as he continues his quest for glory. Tensions first arose during stage 11 of the race, when Mr Froome was instructed to hold back so that Mr Wiggins could catch up and retain the leader's yellow jersey. In a thinly veiled criticism yesterday - which has now been deleted - the blonde South African sports . Ms Cound and Mrs Wiggins exchanged thinly-veiled jibes on Twitter . photographer tweeted: 'Team work is also about giving the people around you, that support you, a chance to shine in their own right.' Mrs Wiggins quickly shot a Tweet back in response which praised other members of the Sky Team Mick Rogers and Richie Porte for 'genuine, selfless effort and true professionalism' -  but omitted Mr Froome. This Tweet led to an immediate response from Ms Cound who replied: 'Don't think there are many . other pro-riders who's partners know more about cycling than Chris's precisely & I know what happened just then.' 'If you want loyalty, get a Froome dog a quality I value although being taken advantage of by others!' Peta Todd, the partner of Mark .

The tension does not seem to have ruffled Mr Wiggins however, as he takes a lead of two minutes and five seconds  over his competitors into the final stage.

The number of U.S. cases of West Nile virus has climbed by nearly a third in the last week, it emerged last night. The spread of the mosquito-borne disease accelerated and threatened to make the 2012 outbreak among the most severe on record, government figures show. So far this year, 2,636 cases have been reported to federal health officials, up from 1,993 reported the week before, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its weekly update of outbreak data. Blood-sucker: The number of U.S. cases of West Nile virus, which is spread by mosquitoes, has climbed by nearly a third in the last week . A total of 118 people have now died from the disease, compared with 87 reported one week ago. The disease has been reported in people, birds or mosquitoes in 48 U.S. states, so far absent only in Alaska and Hawaii. About 40 per cent of all human cases are in Texas, the CDC said. Two-thirds of the cases have cropped up in six states. Officials are convinced . that this will be the worst year for West Nile virus deaths and severe . illnesses since the disease hit America's shores in 1999. The worst year for the mosquito-borne . disease was 2002, which saw nearly 3,000 severe cases and 284 deaths. West Nile virus is a disease spread by mosquitoes. It was first diagnosed in Uganda in 1937, . but no cases were reported in the U.S. until 1999 in New York. The . virus gradually spread across the country. Only about one in five infected people report feeling unwell. Early symptoms can include fever, headache and body aches. Some . recover in a matter of days. But one in 150 infected people will . develop severe symptoms including neck stiffness, disorientation, coma . and paralysis. Of the cases reported to the CDC this year, 1,405, or 53 per cent, are of the severe neuroinvasive form of the disease, which can lead to meningitis and encephalitis. The milder form of the disease causes flu-like symptoms and is rarely lethal. While the height of mosquito season has . passed, infections are expected to continue into October, and severe . illness and death reports are expected to keep coming in for months, CDC . officials said. West Nile outbreaks tend to be unpredictable. Hot temperatures, rainfall amounts and ecological factors such as the bird and mosquito populations have to align just right to trigger an outbreak like the one this year. It was first diagnosed in Uganda in 1937, but no cases were reported in the U.S. until 1999 in New York. The virus gradually spread across the country.

"By . Meghan Keneally . UPDATED: . 01:27 EST, 17 February 2012 . The cold case of the missing teenage girl who disappeared while on spring break three years ago is now coming back into the spotlight as police identify a convicted sex offender as a ‘person of interest’. Brittanee Drexel, who was 17 at the time of her ill-fated vacation, disappeared after leaving a group of friends at their hotel in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina around 9pm. When she left the Blue Water Resort, she headed back to the room where she and some girlfriends were staying at the Bar Harbor Hotel which is just 1.4 miles away down a busy road. Security footage at the Bar Harbor Hotel shows that Brittanee never made it there. Linked: Police think that Raymond Moody is involved in both the disappearances of Crystal Soles (left) and Brittanee Drexel (right) who went missing in 2005 and 2009 respectively . Instead, she vanished during that small stretch of a walk, and she has never been seen again. The last trace of Brittanee came from her cell phone in Georgetown County, South Carolina, which is about 50 miles south of the hotel where she was last seen. Brittanee, a high school junior from Rochester, New York, was not even supposed to be in Myrtle Beach when she disappeared. She had gotten into an argument with her mother who would not allow her to go on the trip with her older friends, and instead of staying at a friend’s home near Lake Ontario like she said she would, Brittanee went on the trip anyway. Police still have not found the girl’s pink cell phone itself, but consider the fact that the signal had travelled so far south to mean that Brittanee was also taken to the area. Last seen: Brittanee was shown on the security footage of the Blue Water Resort in Myrtle Beach as she left the room of a group of her male friends and headed to the nearby hotel where she and some girlfriends were staying . Gone: She should have been able to make the 1.4 mile walk- which ran along a busy road- between the hotels, but security footage at the Bar Harbor Hotel never showed her re-entering . Throughout the multi-year search police have said that there were anywhere between one and three people of interest, but have never formally released the names of these individuals either to the press or to Brittanee’s family. Person of interest: Raymond Moody, 51, spent 21 years in a California prison for abducting and raping a 9-year-old girl . In August,  however, Georgetown County police conducted an extremely thorough investigation of apartment number 22 in an area motel called Sunset Lodge. A convicted sex offender named Raymond Moody, 51, checked into that room on April 24, 2009- the day before Brittanee disappeared. ‘We cannot eliminate him as a person of interest,’ Myrtle Beach police captain Joe Vella told FoxNews. Moody . was issued a speeding ticket in Surfside- a town in between Myrtle . Beach and Georgetown County- the day after Brittanee disappeared. His previous run-ins with the law were significantly more violent, and he is classified as a level 3 sex offender. Moody . spent 21 years in prison stemming back to a 1983 abduction and rape . case of a 9-year-old California girl, and was considered the suspect in a . number of similar rapes, but was never charged. Spring break gone bad: Brittanee Drexel (right) was visiting Myrtle Beach in April 2009 when she went missing. She was last seen leaving the hotel where one group of friends was staying, but never made it back to her own room. Rebellious: Brittanee got in a fight with her mom because her mother did not want her to go to Myrtle Beach with her older group of friends. Brittanee went regardless and told her mother she was at a friend's house . Police have stressed that while they are investigating Moody, this is not new. ‘Mr. Moody was a person that was investigated in this case. His hotel room was searched last year and he is one of many people that we have investigated during the course of this investigation,’ Myrtle Beach police captain David Knipe wrote in a statement to Carolina Live. During that search of his apartment, police reportedly took pieces of the wallpaper from the bathroom, portions of the mattress cover, and sprayed an unknown substance on the sink, refrigerator, and curtains. ‘This is still an active investigation and we continue to follow any and every lead possible,’ Mr Knipe continued. Covering the coast: The distance Brittanee hoped to walk wasn't far (inset) but her last cell service came from Georgetown, which is 50 miles south of Myrtle Beach . Investigations in the wooded area near the apartment where Moody was staying in Georgetown have been fruitless . In addition to their suspicions about Moody’s involvement in Brittanee’s disappearance, police have also linked him to a very similar case where then 28-year-old Crystal Soles went missing in 2005- a year after Moody was released from prison. She was last seen in Andrews, South Carolina, which is to the east of Georgetown. While police have said that they no longer feel that Brittanee is alive, her single mother Dawn is holding out hope. ‘Every day is a nightmare,’ she told FoxNews.  ‘I miss her so much.’","Brittanee Drexel, then 17, was last seen on hotel security footage in 2009 as she headed back to her room, but she never made it there .

A man has walked for the first time in 26 years after a road accident left him in a wheelchair at the age of 21. Mark Hornby sustained serious head injuries in 1986 and doctors warned his parent he could be a 'vegetable' for the rest of his life. But Mr Hornby proved them wrong and thanks to martial arts classes he can now stand unaided and move a few steps. Scroll down for video . Mark Hornby stands with the aid of martial arts instructor John Turner . Mark started attending John Turner's academy in Brigg, Lincolnshire when it first opened in 2000. He said the classes gave him the confidence to start stretching himself. 'I like coming here,' said Mark. 'It’s made me much more flexible. John has made me stand and I’ve been breaking wooden boards. 'When I’m warming up and John tells me to stand for 10 seconds, I always increase my targets and I say make it 20. 'He gets me to recite about how I am calm, I am positive, I am confident in order to control my breathing.' Now there is hope Mark will eventually be able to walk again properly. Speaking about Mark’s remarkable journey, Mr Turner said: 'We are now on the brink of something phenomenal. 'I really believe Mark will be walking . in the not too distant future. He has the determination, perseverance . and spirit to make it happen. 'When he first came into the academy, he . didn’t know if he could do anything, so I taught him some hand . techniques. He eventually moved on to hand hitting, using nunchucks - a . type of martial arts fighting sticks - and board breaking.' 'I got him a new tripod frame and he’s now standing with that. 'He’s got strength . in his body to stand - the challenge now is overcoming his mind, so . that’s why we’re using the ancient martial arts methods of mind, body . and spirit. 'I know he . can do it - he’s not giving up.' Mark Hornby with proud parents Liz and Bob. The couple didn't think their son would live after the car accident . Mark was hit by a car when he was a student at the University of Bradford in 1986, which left him in a coma for nine months. He spent almost a year in Hull Royal Infirmary and was later transferred to Castle Hill Hospital to start his rehabilitation. Mark’s father, Bob Hornby, 79, said: 'We . didn’t think he would live, to be honest. He had massive head and . internal injuries and he broke his legs so has been in a wheelchair and . we were told he always would be.' Mark's parents said martial arts has given their son 'everything to live for' after it dramatically increased his mobility. His father added: 'Mark has a fantastic sense of humour and that’s what’s kept him alive and going forward - he’s got his own house now and we have carers going in 24/7.' Mark's mother Liz, 76, said: 'When he first came home from hospital he could do very little. They more or less told us to put him in a home because they said he would be like a vegetable and we wouldn’t be able to look after him, but I wanted to give it a try. 'His body has built new brain cells over the years. He’s had to build up the repetition of sending the signal that he wants to stand until it clicks into place. 'It’s been a very long and slow process. Every year he can do something that he couldn’t do the last, but it’s small progress all the same.'","Martial arts classes helped to strengthen Mark's body .

The 22-year-old man had to  be wrestled to the ground by  air hostesses and fellow passengers before being tied down  with seatbelts. The flight from Majorca to  Newcastle then made an  emergency landing at Gatwick so he could be arrested. The drama unfolded as the 22-year-old man attempted to open the emergency doors of the Thomson flight at 36,000ft (file picture) A 28-year-old passenger, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It was dark but suddenly all the lights came on and all the air hostesses were shouting and we could see a man trying to open the emergency door. 'The plane started shaking. I thought it was going to go down. ‘His friends tried to pull him away from the door and he started punching them and saying 'It’s OK we are just on a simulator.' ‘Then another man came from nowhere and smacked him in the head.’ The mid-air drama started about 45 minutes into the early morning Thomson flight TOM1269 from Palma Airport on Wednesday. Lights in the cabin were  dimmed and most passengers were sleeping or eating breakfast when cabin crew rushed to deal with the incident. Shaken: The McCallum family from Billingham, Teesside, told of their mid-flight terror, as a crazed passenger on their Thomson flight from Palma, Mallorca to Newcastle, tried to open the plane's door at 36,000ft . With help from other passengers the air hostesses managed to restrain the passenger and wrestle him into a seat. They then used around eight seatbelts to tie him up. Children were crying and passengers were panicking as the plane made its sudden descent. The passenger continued: ‘The plane went down really quickly, it was quite a dodgy landing. All our ears were popping. Then as soon  as it came to a stop about six  police officers ran on board and arrested him.’ After police took statements from passengers and the plane was  refuelled, the holidaymakers were able to continue their return journey to Newcastle. Dan Alberts, 20, from Bensham, Gateshead, who was on the flight with a group of friends, said he heard one air hostess shout to the man that he could have killed everyone on board. The incident occurred on a Newcastle-bound flight which left from Palma, Majorca (pictured), yesterday morning. The pilot made an emergency landing at Gatwick Airport . He said: ‘We just heard a big  bang and then he started going  for the door. One of the girls I  was with started having a panic attack and there were quite a few people crying. ‘There were a lot of kids on the plane screaming their heads off.’ Gavin McCallum, from Billingham, Teesside, was on the flight with his wife Sarah, 30, and children Freya, three, and Jack, two. The 35-year-old said: ‘It was  terrifying. We didn’t know that  he had tried to open the door until we landed and I’m quite grateful for that. ‘When we were on the ground and realised what had happened it was quite disturbing. ‘The cabin crew were fantastic. The pilot told me he had been flying for 20 years and that is the only time anything like that has happened.’ The man, of Ashington, Northumberland, was questioned by police on suspicion of endangering the safety of an aircraft. He was bailed pending further enquiries. A spokesman for Thomson Airways said: ‘We would like to reassure customers that it would not have been possible for this passenger to open the aircraft door while the aircraft was in the air. ‘We would also like to reassure our customers that incidents of this type are extremely rare.’","22-year-old man had to be tied up with eight seatbelts .

Apple's new CEO Tim Cook knew that he was facing an impossible task when he was tapped as the one to fill Steve Job's iconic turtleneck. 'Steve was a genius and a visionary… He’s an irreplaceable person. Steve was an original and I don’t think there is another one of those being made. I’ve never felt the weight of trying to be Steve. It’s not who I am and it’s not my goal in life,' Mr Cook said at a recent technology conference. 'I learned a lot from Steve. It was absolutely the saddest days of my life when he passed away. Opening up: Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke at the All Things Digital tech conference in California on Tuesday . 'At some point late last year, somebody kind of shook me and said, it’s time to get on. That sadness was replaced by his intense determination to continue the journey. Without revealing too many details from the labs of the notoriously-secretive company, Mr Cook said that while Mr Jobs was always going to be remembered and honored, the best way to do so would be to continue his legacy by moving forward with their various endeavors. 'I love museums, but I don't want to live in one,' he said. 'He also taught me the joy is in the journey and that was a revelation for me.' Where that journey will lead is the next question for many Apple observers, as the company's acquisitions are closely monitored. Tim Cook, left, seen with Steve Jobs in 2010, took over after Mr Jobs' death in October of last year . The television arena is one that is expected to be on the company's radar, and Mr Cook's comments at the All Things Digital conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California confirmed the theories. The annual conference was hosted by The Wall Street Journal which posted a video of his interview. Apple already produces set-top box product for televisions, called Apple TV, and they plan to 'keep pulling this string and see where it takes us,' implying that it certainly is not going to be their last product in that field. 'This is an area of intense interest for us,' Mr Cook said, though he refused to answer the question of whether or not Apple is developing a television set. Hobby: Mr Cook's recent comments confirm theories that the company's next big move will be in the direction of the television industry . In previous interviews, the $99 Apple TV unit has been dubbed a 'hobby' within the company, and at the conference he reaffirmed such a title saying that it would remain as such even though Apple is not known for being a 'hobby kind of company'. 'It’s not a fifth leg of the stool. It’s not of the same market size of the phone business or the Mac business or the music business or the tablet business,' Yahoo News reports Mr Cook saying. Secretive: In keeping with Apple's notoriously closely-guarded ways, Mr Cook did not reveal any new acquisitions or plans . 'Here's the way we would look at (television), not just at this area but other areas, and ask can we control the key technology? Can we make a significant contribution, far beyond what others have done in this area? Can we make a product that we would want?' Mr Cook also discussed the tablet and smartphone market, maintaining an almost modest stance on Apple's role in shaping the two fields- marking a significant personality difference from that of Mr Jobs who was known for his dramatic boastfulness of his company's products. 'I wouldn’t say we dominate (the smartphone market). I’d say we have the best phone,' Mr Cook said. 'We didn’t invent the tablet market. It was there. We invented the modern tablet,' echoing himself. Certain criticisms of the company were . also discussed, including their decision to base manufacturing in Asia . as opposed to the U.S., which Mr Cook explained was a logistical move. Factories in China have had multiple suicides, even installing nets to prevent stressed and tired workers from leaping to their deaths. 'Some . people want to work a lot. They want to move and work for a year or two . and then move back to their village and bring back as much money as . they can,' Cook said. Defining products: Mr Cook said that while they didn't create the . smartphone and tablet markets, their products are the best in those . fields . 'On the assembly piece, could that be done in the U.S.? I hope so, again, one day.' Another . point of tech-world gossip fascination is Apple's relationship with . Facebook, a company whose grasp on the needs of the people is arguably . one that Apple- and many others- want all for themselves. Mr Cook denied that they are sworn enemies and had only positive comments when asked. 'Facebook is a great company. And the relationship is solid. I saw (Chief Operating Officer) Sheryl (Sandberg) earlier outside. We have great respect for each other,' he said. 'They have their way of doing things, but people say that about us as well. Just because they have a point of view doesn’t mean we can’t work with each other.'","Tim Cook, who took over Apple after Steve Job died last year, spoke on a wide range of issues about new product development and his takeover .

They'd spent £2,000 on the trip, which included flights, vaccinations and malaria tablets and a honeymoon package at the  Laico Atlantic Banjul Hotel, which included fresh fruit and sparkling wine upon their arrival. But when they arrived they were devastated to discover there was no five-star reception and their honeymoon suite had two single beds. Their disappointment grew as they looked around to discover dirty curtains, loose plug sockets, a stained toilet seat and a faulty air-conditioning unit held together with just masking tape. A broken shower head meant that they had to stand in the corner of the bathroom to have any chance to getting under the water. When they left the room for the solace of the beach they claim they were hassled endlessly by staff members touting for business. Mr Monk said: 'We were expecting rest and relaxation but at every turn someone was trying to hassle us for money - you had to hold on tight to your bags otherwise staff would carry them for you and then demand a cash tip. 'We were looking forwards to a lovely romantic break and I did not expect to be spending the first night of our honeymoon comforting my crying wife. It was a complete nightmare. 'After such a wonderful wedding day and looking forward to a great honeymoon for such a long time, all we were left with was bad memories which tainted the whole wedding experience. 'It was a very expensive holiday for us but it was so upsetting because what we got was far from what we were promised - it was certainly anything but relaxing.' Five-star: Adam and Sarah Monk's experience was far from the luxury advertised on the hotel's website . The Laico Atlantic Resort: Adam and Sarah claim they were hassled by pushy and aggressive staff at the resort . The couple said the pushy approach from staff made them feel intimidated and with no sign of their holiday rep at the resort they were left feeling isolated. Deciding a change of room would not be enough to end their ordeal, they took the massive decision to book flights home instead, after just one night, at a cost of an extra £600. They jetted out of Gambia the following day - meaning their honeymoon had lasted just two full days. Mr Monk said: 'Even though our trip was so short, we felt a massive sense of relief to be heading home from the nightmare.' Their nightmare ordeal was far from finished though as, following a night in the airport hotel, they then had to catch three separate coaches and spent almost 10 hours getting back to Suffolk - more than 200 miles away. Incredibly the couple have been told they cannot claim a refund from operator Thomas Cook, because they didn't register an official complaint during their short stay in Gambia. Wedded bliss: The couple are now planning a second honeymoon, in the UK . A spokesman for Thomas Cook said: 'We urge all customers to make contact with us while in resort if they have any concerns about their hotel or holiday/honeymoon arrangements, as we have a dedicated team of representatives on hand to offer immediate assistance. 'Regrettably Mr and Mrs Monk did not give us an opportunity to help on this occasion.' Mr Monk said: 'When you look through the small print, there is a line about registering complaints whilst on the holiday but the last thing you are thinking about when you book your honeymoon months in advance is about it being a nightmare and having to complain. 'The fact that our honeymoon was ruined was one thing but the attitude of Thomas Cook about putting it right for us has been a complete shock. 'We did not want anything more than our money back - we are not asking for any compensation but they just don't want to take responsibility for it and their attitude has bordered on hostile - they are concentrating on finding the loopholes to get out of paying us anything rather than trying to make things right.' His bride Sarah added: 'I was in tears, floods of tears - it was just not what we had expected or the relaxing experience we have been told about when we booked it. 'It was just absolutely awful - I did not want to be there and just wanted to get home. 'It was not what a bride would expect on the first night of a honeymoon - I think the room was the low point, it's not where you spend the whole time but I think it's an important part of the honeymoon. 'To have it in that condition, in sweltering heat and the air conditioning unit not working, it was terrible.' The couple are now planning a second honeymoon but will stay in the UK this time, with a trip to Devon or Cornwall on the cards. Mr Monk added: 'Luckily, when we got back, the weather at home was nice so we managed to have an enjoyable week off work but we could not stop thinking about how we should have been enjoying our honeymoon. 'It has been embarrassing and upsetting when our wedding guests, who kindly donated cash towards the honeymoon, have been asking us how the trip was and we have to tell them about how it all went so badly wrong.'

Fighting for her life: Retired nurse Lorraine Scurr is in critical condition in hospital after surviving a horrifying 60ft cliff fall that killed her husband . This is the first picture of the retired nurse who is fighting for her life after surviving a horrifying 60ft cliff fall that killed her husband. Lorraine Scurr, 65, and her husband Peter, 69, lost their footing on Monday while climbing to a viewpoint over the village of St Aubin in Jersey. The holidaying couple from Southampton fell and landed on the concrete roof of a Nazi Second World War bunker that forms part of the popular Jersey War Tunnels museum. Mr Scurr died instantly. His wife . grabbed some tree branches and locals heard her screams as she clung . to the cliff face before she lost her grip. Mrs Scurr suffered severe head injuries and was last night flown to a hospital in Southampton, where she is undergoing specialist treatment. A hospital spokesman said on Wednesday she remained in 'serious' condition. Emergency services were called by a horrified passer-by who witnessed the fall shortly after 5pm on Monday. The couple had been taking a stroll along a disused railway line that links St. Aubin to the capital St.Helier. It's believed they left the path and climbed a steep bank to get a better view of the village below and lost their footing. Locals said the steep path they used was slippery following torrential rain. Holidaymakers staying near the scene described how a crowd of people rushed to help Mrs Scurr after hearing her pleas for help. The woman from Bristol, who did not want to be named, said: 'We heard a lady screaming for help, it was horrendous. 'We ran along Railway Walk and there were a couple of people already there. 'I think she had fallen part of the way and then we heard her fall again onto the concrete roof.' Jersey Police are investigating the incident, but last night said they . believe it was a 'tragic accident' and were preparing a report for the . Deputy Viscount, the island’s coroner. They added the couple were regular visitors to Jersey. The bunker they fell upon forms part of the Jersey War Tunnels museum, an unfinished underground hospital and a network of tunnels built by the Germans after they occupied Jersey during the Second World War. Accident: Firefighters at the scene of the tragedy where Peter Scurr fell to his death on to the concrete roof of the German tunnels below Railway Walk . Fall: Eyewitnesses claim Mr Scurr appeared to lose his footing before he fell while his wife managed to grab on to some tree branches . After Jersey was liberated in 1945, the tunnels were turned into a museum which now tells the story of the Nazi invasion of the island . - the only part of the British Isles that was occupied. The Scurrs, regular guide dog volunteers, were accompanied on their walk by a four-month-old Guide Dog puppy, their eighth, called Skipper. The Scurrs were walking along Railway Walk, which follows a disused railway line that was taken over by German troops during their occupation . There was no-one at their £220,000 semi-detached, three bedroom house today. A black Chevrolet Lacetti estate car was parked on the drive. Last night a distraught family member, who asked not to be named, said: 'We are heartbroken. They were so in love and always together.' Southampton Guide Dogs mobility team manager Tim Stafford said: 'We’re very sorry to learn of the sad death of Mr Scurr. 'He was a dedicated volunteer puppy walker, fundraiser and speaker. He . was a great ambassador for Guide Dogs and will be missed by all who knew . him. 'Our thoughts are with his family.' Mrs Scurr also regularly helped at St Patrick’s Church, in Southampton. Father Claron Conde said: 'Lorraine is a very generous woman and very active, nothing is too much trouble for her. 'They loved to go walking and were always out enjoying the countryside. 'Lorraine is very involved in helping local disadvantaged children and is involved in the Sunday Liturgy. 'Her husband was a very nice man and we will be holding a memorial mass in the morning. 'Everyone is very shocked and devastated at what has happened. We have had messages of support pouring in all day.'

Arrested: Thomas Langenbach, 47, was caught swapping bar codes on boxes of Lego at Target in Cupertino . A top Silicon Valley executive has been switching bar codes on Lego boxes in a scam to buy the toys at huge discounts, according to authorities. Thomas Langenbach, 47, is vice-president of SAP, a global software company in Palo Alto, California. He is expected to be arraigned today on four felony counts of burglary at Santa Clara County Court. The 47-year-old was being watched by security at several Target stores after his purchases were flagged as suspicious. On May 8, staff at the Target branch in Cupertino recognised him and placed him under surveillance. He was caught red-handed covering the store's  labels with his own. When he walked out with a set, which he didn't pay full price for, security apprehended him and called the police. Langenbach carried out the scam by making his own bar codes using his software skills, according to police. He would then surreptitiously switch the tags before going to the check-out point. It allowed him to buy a $279 box of Millenium Falcon box for just $49, for example. Liz Wylie, of Mountain View police, told Mercury News that Langenbach was caught on CCTV performing the scam with expensive Lego kits. When his multimillion-dollar home in San Carlos was searched by police, they discovered hundreds of Lego boxes stashed inside. The bricks were ordered by size, color and style. Scroll down for video . Scam: Langenbach, 47, was seen on CCTV at several Target stores switching bar codes on huge boxes of Lego to buy them at massive discount . Operation: The tech executive allegedly sold more than 2,000 Lego boxes on eBay for $30,000 . The tech executive allegedly sold more than 2,000 items on eBay for around $30,000 under the name 'tomsbrickyard'. Authorities found a bag of pre-made bar codes in Langenbach's car. He was arrested on May 9 and charged with stealing seven boxes of Lego worth $1,000. He posted $10,000 bail on the same day. The tech executive's motives were unclear but authorities suggested he may have acted out of 'boredom or compulsion'. Ms Wylie said: 'In his house, we found hundreds of boxes of unopened Lego sets... The motive was clearly money. Why does he want the money? I don't know. I can think of a million different possible scenarios.' Baffling: Lagenbach's motive for stealing the Lego was unclear considering he is VP of a multinational tech company and lives in this multimillion dollar home in San Carlos, California . SAP, the software company that the 47-year-old works for, offers a detailed guide on their website how to create bar codes. Lagenbach has been with SAP since 1988 and moved to the company's Palo Alto base in 2000, according to his LinkedIn profile. He has a degree in computer science and business administration from Berufsakademie Mannheim university in Germany.

Erin was forced to learn how to walk again, bend her limbs and eat but sadly her singing voice was damaged beyond repair.

Despite the 21-year-old's inspirational show of bravery she still became the target of Facebook trolls who created a page about her saying she was disgusting. Erin, from Alloa, has now decided to fight back by entering an international pageant in an incredible bid to prove that beauty really is more than skin deep. Already named Miss International Scotland, the 21-year-old will compete against other contestants from around the world at the final in Chicago next month. 'Discrimination is not acceptable,' Erin told the Daily Star. Brave: Erin's dreams of becoming a singer were dashed after her vocal cords were damaged by smoke inhalation and feeding tubes .

Erin was looking at a bright future before her accident and was on the verge of a record deal when the fire broke out. Firefighters believe the blaze was started by a pot that was left on the stove. The house was engulfed in minutes with temperatures reaching 600 degrees. Erin's arms and chest were burned to the bone and the rest of her body left red-raw and blistered. Doctors even considered amputating her arms but eventually performed pioneering surgery using extracts of shark skin, which tricks the body into growing new skin cells. After three weeks doctors stapled on healthy skin, like a graft and the new cells helped her arms to heal and stop leaking fluid. But the accident still left her with an apron of loose skin around her belly and she was forced to endure the discomfort of further surgery to remove it. Erin now volunteers with the fire service and has a boyfriend, Grant, whose dad is also in the fire service.","Erin McNeill suffered third degree burns when her house was ravaged by fire in 2009 - putting an end to her promising singing career .

Defending the Union: Ed Miliband accused Jeremy Clarkson and the Scottish National Party of holding 'deeply pessimistic' of national identity . The majority of English and Welsh people want to save the Union and prevent Scotland becoming independent, it was revealed today. Only one in three asked by pollsters said they would be happy if their northern neighbours left the United Kingdom. The new survey by The Independent asked whether Scotland should be separate and independent, and two out of three said no. Its result flies in the face of claims that most English and Welsh would be happy not to 'subsidise' Scotland, as some critics have claimed happens. ComRes said when asked if they agreed Scotland should be separate from the rest of the UK and become independent, 28 per cent agreed, 57 per cent disagreed and 15 per cent didn't know. And only one in five pensioners wanted Scotland to gain independence. It came as Labour leader Ed Miliband launched an attack on Jeremy Clarkson and Scottish nationalists in a speech hailing patriotism and defending the Union. Mr Miliband criticised the Top Gear presenter for ‘shrugging his shoulders’ at the prospect of Scotland breaking away from the UK. He accused the likes of Mr Clarkson and the Scottish National Party of holding ‘deeply pessimistic’ and ‘narrow’ views of national identity and warn that it is a ‘false choice’ to ask people whether they want to be Scottish or British in the referendum that is expected in 2014. Mr Clarkson used his newspaper column in January to proclaim: ‘If the Scottish people want to break away, then I shall stand on Hadrian’s Wall with a teary handkerchief, and say, “Good riddance to the lot of you, and take your stupid bagpipes with you”.’ Scroll down to watch Ed Miliband's speech . Controversial: Top gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson used his newspaper column in January to declare how he would say 'good riddance' to Scottish people if they chose to break away from the Union . In a speech at the Royal Festival Hall in London, the Labour leader warned against a retreat into narrow nationalism within the United Kingdom and call for a  progressive patriotism which embraces the mixed identities of modern Britons. He said: ‘The nationalists of the SNP pose a false choice. They ask: are you Scottish or British?  I say you can be both. And here in England there are people like  Jeremy Clarkson who shrug their shoulders at the prospect of the break-up of the Union. ‘It’s a mistake wherever you find it. Having to say Scottish or British, Welsh or British, English or British. I don’t accept any of that. It’s always a false choice. 'We in the Labour Party have been too reluctant to talk about England in recent years, as if somehow talking about England is a threat to the United Kingdom. 'Somehow, while there has been a lot of romanticism on the left about Scottish identity and Welsh identity, English identity has just tended to be a completely closed book, something that people have shied away from. 'Why is that? I think it's partly . because people have been nervous that it undermines the union, but also . because it was connected for some people with the kind of nationalism . that left people ill at ease.' Winning: Ed Miliband said England's run at Euro '96 had helped reclaim a sense of national identity . He . said the Union Flag had been reclaimed from the National Front and the . Euro 96 football tournament reclaimed the English flag. But there was still 'nervousness' and polling showed some people still associated the Cross of St George with racism. 'That's not my view, I think we should be proud of the flag of St George, I think we should applaud people who fly it.' He urged the Scots to back the England football team yesterday - and then said he wouldn't mind if Scotsmen backed France instead. The Labour leader risked ridicule over mixed messages as he made a speech on national identity. Mr Miliband said the England football team would need all the help it can get at the European Championships which begins on FridayI. But his attempt to keep everyone happy only risked offending everyone. In answer to a question about whether Scots should support England, he added: 'England needs as many supporters as it can get in these championships but I don't think it makes them un-British if they don't support it. That's what's important about national identity.' In a message to First Minister Alex Salmond, he said: 'Economic progress is not going to be achieved through Scotland leaving the United Kingdom and simply being part of Europe. 'It's going to be achieved with Scotland part of the United Kingdom. Our identities, our economies, are too intertwined to believe anything else. 'Change will come when the United Kingdom works together, not pulls apart.' Admitting that his party has been ‘ill at ease’ discussing nationalism in recent years, Mr Miliband said: ‘For too long people have believed that to express English identity is to undermine the Union. At the same time we have helped express Scottish identity within the Union. ‘This does not make sense. You can be proudly Scottish and British. And you can be proudly English and British, as I am.’","New poll finds two out of three don't want Scotland to leave the UK .

A patient who complained about the treatment she and a frail blind woman received at the hands of a poorly-trained nurse was branded a racist. Sandra Hynes, 50, had only gone into hospital for a simple operation to relieve her acid reflux, but following complications was left with a punctured right lung. She had to stay in for an extra two weeks and was put on morphine and oxygen to cope with her pain. Accusations: Sandra Hynes (right) complained about the treatment at Chelsea and Westminster hospital only to be told she was a racist by staff nurse Maureen Nwadike . But further problems arose when her morphine drip and oxygen needed replenishing over a weekend. Astonishingly, the staff on duty had not been trained in how to insert a ‘cannula’ needle into her hand, and struggled to provide new oxygen, leaving her in excruciating pain. When she was given morphine orally instead, and began hallucinating and crying, a member of staff told her off. Her patience finally snapped when a nurse fed hot soup to a blind patient in the bed next to her, leaving her blistered and screaming. Mrs Hynes told the junior nurse – who happened to be black – that she should have tested the temperature of the soup before serving it. Moments later the nurse’s superior, Staff Nurse Maureen Nwadike – who is also black – arrived in the ward, and told horrified Mrs Hynes: ‘You’re racist.’ Despite being in great pain, the patient grabbed a Zimmer frame and tried to leave the hospital. Now, following a complaint, the Chelsea and Westminster hospital in West London has apologised for her appalling treatment. Sandra Hynes, 50, had only gone into hospital for a simple operation to relieve her acid reflux, but following complications was left with a punctured right lung . Last night Mrs Hynes, of Grays in Essex, said: ‘I was called a racist for complaining about a lady  getting scalded, and because no one was able to fix my morphine over the whole weekend. It was a horrific experience. ‘I was in terrible pain, and because it was over the weekend no one could do anything about it. ‘I was scared to be on the ward, and about what might happen while I was asleep. ‘At one stage I even took a Zimmer frame and tried to get out so I could call for help on the street. ‘I never want to go there again, however ill I am.’ Following her complaint, Senior Nurse Sian Davies admitted in a long letter: . ‘It is recognised that there are indeed less doctors working at the weekend, which unfortunately resulted in a severe delay in reviewing your pain relief, which is not acceptable. ‘You also described how Nurse Hannah did not know how to change the oxygen. She was  relatively new to the ward, not  very confident, and has learnt from the experience. ‘And you described how Nurse Maureen Nwadike accused you of being racist. 'The behaviour you described will not be tolerated and is not acceptable. I will be monitoring her communication skills.’ Contacted at her home in Thamesmead, South-East London, Mrs Nwadike, whose husband Anthony, 54, is a director of a private nursing business, refused to comment.","Sandra Hynes, 50, went in for acid reflux treatment  but following complications was left with a punctured lung .

A Tory donor avoided tax by flying outside UK airspace on his private jet at night, a lobbyist has claimed. The millionaire donor is said to have routinely flown out of Luton airport in the evening so he could sleep on his jet. Because he was outside British jurisdiction at night, this allowed him to extend the number of days he could stay in the UK without paying tax. Jet dodge: The millionaire donor is said to have routinely flown out of . Luton airport so he could extend the number of days he could stay in the UK without paying tax . As a non-resident, he could spend just 91 full days in the country each year. The arrangement was revealed by Sarah Southern, the lobbyist at the centre of the recent cash-for-Cameron scandal. The former aide to the Prime Minister made her comments during a dinner with undercover reporters in Zurich earlier this year. The identity of the donor, who would often skip out of the country overnight to avoid tax, is not known. Ms Southern said: 'I love that 90-day thing... because it's a full day. 'I know someone who will sometimes get on his jet and fly out and fly back in after midnight. So he's not been there for a whole day.' She said the donor was so rich that it was worth his while making flights to nowhere to avoid an enormous tax bill. Whistleblower: The arrangement was revealed by Sarah Southern, the lobbyist at the centre of the recent cash-for-Cameron scandal . The lobbyist said that with a fortune like his, 'you can sleep on your jet three times a week. You can do whatever you want. The world literally is your oyster.' She said a helicopter took the donor to Luton airport where he stepped onto his jet and retired for the night in an onboard bedroom. Since 2008, the tax authorities' 'midnight rule' has applied to anyone who is still in the UK on midnight of the 91st day. Before 2010, days travelling in and out of the country were not counted under the 91-day rule. The donor could therefore have saved two days off his entitlement with each overnight trip. The guidelines were changed by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to include the days that a non-resident is in the country at midnight, even if they have just travelled into Britain that day. Ms Southern told the reporters that she believed the donor's tax arrangements have since changed. Chancellor George Osborne has described aggressive tax avoiders as 'morally repugnant' and has warned tax cheats that the government 'will find you and your money'. The revelations come two weeks after Peter Cruddas, the former Tory party co-treasurer, was forced to resign after he was filmed selling meetings with the PM for £250,000. He told the undercover reporters how he himself had made a fortune by avoiding taxes on financial transactions. The spread-betting tycoon said his firm, CMC Markets, got around tax rules legally by classing transactions as 'bets' rather than conventional trades. He said: 'That's my claim to glory. If you bet on something in the UK you avoid capital gains tax and stamp duty.'","Unnamed donor routinely flew out of Luton airport in the evening .

The wife and mother of missing Guma Aguiar have launched furious attacks on each other as they both wage a legal war to control the millionaire philanthropists $100 million fortune. Court documents filed in Broward County Clerk of Courts yesterday by Jamie Aguiar allege that her mother-in-law Ellen Aguiar is 'incapable of looking out for the interest of anyone but herself.' In her counter-petition to become the conservator, or temporary guardian of her husband's assets, Jamie accused her mother-in-law of becoming an 'impediment' to the investigation into Guma's disappearance after his empty boat washed up ashore on a Fort Lauderdale beach last week. Wranglings: Ellen . Aguiar (pictured left) mother of missing Guma, is in a legal battle with . his wife Jamie (right) over his $100million fortune . This comes as friends of Guma Aguiar said that he'd been spiraling out of control for years, and seemed troubled and confused shortly before he disappeared as he sought treatment for severe bipolar disorder. 'The lawsuits were taking a major toll on him. Emotionally. Mentally. He . was completely spent,' said Bob Denison, a 35-year-old yacht broker who . met Aguiar in high school. The battle between 35-year-old Aguiar's mother and wife has led to three legal filings between the pair over who will eventually gain control of the family fortune. 'Rather than rally around her family in this most difficult of times, Ellen Aguiar instead focused on being first to the courthouse, petitioning this Court to serve in a position she is ill-suited to hold as she is incapable of looking out for the interest of anyone but herself,' Jamie Aguiar said in her filing, obtained by ABCNews.com. Accusing her mother-in-law of tampering with 'critical pieces of evidence', including Guma Aguiar's cell phone and wallet, Jamie Aguiar's filed her petition on Monday. Without a trace: Guma Aguiar went missing on June 20th after leaving his family home . 'These items were subsequently returned by Ellen Aguiar's attorney, but not before she made a few phone calls and possibly deleted critical voice and/or text messages,' said Jamie Aguiar's legal team in her court filing. Troubled? Guma Aguiar's mother has claimed her . son and wife Jamie were heading for a divorce before his empty boat . washed up on a Florida beach . 'While Jamie Aguiar has been home grieving and trying to add to the search efforts being conducted privately and in conjunction with the authorities, Ellen has been attempting to take control of the Jamie and Guma's assets without even providing Jamie with notice.' Refuting these claims, Ellen Aguiar's attorney Richard Baron, was unequivocal. 'She's a liar,' remarked Baron speaking about Jamie Aguiar. 'Ellen Aguiar never asked for the phome. 'She never asked for the wallet. That's complete and utter fantasy. 'It's creative writing and it's a third-rate novel.' Ellen Aguiar's attorney explained that the phone and wallet were handed to her when she arrived at the water front when police discovered her son's empty boat. He explained that she checked her son's phone for any clues as to his disappearance but couldn't access his phone because she didn't know the password. He added that she gave them to him and he handed them to the police. Jamie Aguiar's legal petition alleges that she and her husband financially supported Ellen for years and gave her the use of a credit card, car and provided her with a home. 'Although Ellen Aguiar purports to have the best interest of her grandchildren at heart, the record will reveal that her actions consistently drove a wdge between the family by seemingly flaming the fumes of Guma Aguiar's paranoia,' said Jamie Aguiar's petition. Accused of being a mother-in-law who 'consistently drove a wedge between the family,' Ellen Aguiar has suggested that Jamie Aguiar demanded a divorce from her son and that this contributed to his despondent mood as he boarded his 31-foot fishing boat. 'I'm of the belief that that's what pushed him over the deep end,' said Baron. 'He loved his wife. He did not want a divorce.' Furthermore, Ellen Aguiar's petition claims that her son's property is in 'imminent danger' of being ,wasted, misappropriated, or lost,' by Jamie Aguiar. The claim to administer Guma Aguiar's $100 million worth of assets alleges that Jamie Aguiar has fired her husband's employees, 'without any reason or justification whatsoever and without a majority vote.' Last sighting: On this time-stamped CCTV footage, Mr Aguiar can be seen leaving his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida . Yesterday, a surveillance video from a South . Florida port shows 35-year-old Guma Aguiar steering his boat into rough . seas less than half an hour after leaving his home. It is the last known . image of the man whose boat washed ashore last week without him. 'I just stare at those pictures of . him on that boat and can't help but be struck by the symbolism of him on . a vessel by himself in rocky seas, fighting a world that he probably . felt like was crashing down on him,' said Wes Shelton, a close family . friend who said Aguiar was troubled in the months before his . disappearance. Aguiar made a fortune in 2006 when the Texas-based energy company he ran with his uncle was sold for a reported $2.5 billion. But he has been locked in a contentious legal battle with his uncle, Thomas Kaplan, over money. A phone call to Kaplan's attorney was not immediately returned Monday. Meanwhile, his mother, Ellen Aguiar, who is fighting for control of his nearly $100 million dollar estate, has claimed she believes her son may have been in a delusional state or suffering from psychosis, according to court records. Famous friends: Aguiar poses with former . presidential candidate Rick Perry while holding the Defender of . Jerusalem Award in Jerusalem in 2009 . She filed an emergency petition while rescuers were still searching for Aguiar's body last week. Police called off their search Thursday night. There was no blood on the vessel and no evidence of foul play. Police have been reviewing the boat's GPS and Aguiar's cell phone, which was on the boat when it washed ashore with its engines still running Wednesday. His wife Jamie has declined interview requests. They have four children who range in age from 10 months to 7 years. Shelton said he knew of no significant emotional triggers just before Aguiar's disappearance but that he'd struggled for years with his mental health. Aguiar had been admitted to psychiatric hospitals several times. Aguiar knew nothing of the oil and gas business when the company he started with his uncle while in his mid-20s struck oil. Keeping kosher: Aguiar embraced his Jewish heritage after being raised as an Evangelical Christian . 'That was his compulsion, that was his obsession. He spent morning, noon and night trying to build that company,' said Shelton, who also worked at the company for a time. But even after selling the company, for which he reportedly received more than $200 million, Aguiar struggled to find happiness. He took a Colorado ski trip with friends shortly after the sale. But while everyone else was relaxing, Aguiar was on his computer working. 'He used to ask me all the time, 'help me decompress, help me relax',' Shelton said. 'I didn't even know what that meant.' Aguiar donated millions to a foundation that helps Jews move to Israel. Denison said Aguiar also liked to give when no one was looking 'reaching out to the guy sleeping on the bus stop, finding a friend a job on the brink of hopelessness.' Aguiar, whose mother is Jewish, was raised Christian but converted to Judaism about a decade ago. He became well-known in Israel after his $4 million investment saved the Israeli Premier League soccer team Beitar Jerusalem a few years ago. But in Israel, he didn't know who to trust and felt he was only embraced because of his money, friends said. The T.T. Zion, the boat that Guma Aguiar was piloting before he went missing is now being held at a . police warehouse in Fort Lauderdale . Guma Aguiar, 35, and his family live in one of the most luxurious parts of Fort Lauderdale . 'He had a lot of hurt and had a lot of regret due to what happened over there,' Shelton said, but declined to elaborate. He pleaded no contest to drug charges in 2009 after deputies said they found marijuana in his Bentley during a traffic stop in South Florida. His family checked him into a psychiatric hospital in Tel Aviv in roughly a year later after he claimed he entered the Gaza Strip and met with an Israeli soldier held there by Hamas militants. His wife filed a domestic violence order against him last summer. A short time later, he filed for dissolution of marriage, but both were voluntarily dismissed, according to court documents.

Jewish millionaire, Guma Aguiar, has contributed millions to charitable causes using his oil and gas wealth . Life seemed to be turning around this year, according to friends. Aguiar was seeking treatment for bipolar disorder and was spending more time with his family, fishing and attending soccer games. Not long before his disappearance, the family vacationed in the Florida Keys. Friends said Jamie Aguiar desperately tried to create a peaceful home life for her husband and wasn't interested in big houses or cars. They married in 2006 before he made his fortune. 'That was all Jamie wanted for him,' said Shelton. 'I think Jamie was really hopeful that the old Guma would come back.' Still, friends sensed that Aguiar wasn't at peace. 'He wasn't doing well. Guma was deeply burdened by the lawsuits he was fighting. I don't think I've ever heard him so confused,' Denison said of his last conversation with Aguiar a few weeks ago.","Missing Guma Aguiar, 35, transferred guardianship of personal property 'in the event of my incapacity' from his wife to mother in May .

A woman has revealed how an old flame secretly camped in a tent at the back of her garden until they were able to be together. When Sue MacLean accepted a Facebook friend request from Alex MacDonald, her former boyfriend of 25 years before, she was intrigued to see if he had changed at all. Gone was the thick mop of black hair and teenage looks, but she realised her feelings were as strong as ever. Love is in the open air: Sue MacLean (left) was reunited via Facebook with Alex MacDonald, who is shown in the tent he pitched near her back garden in Banchory, Aberdeenshire . Romance rekindled: Sue MacLean and Alex MacDonald got back in touch last year - 25 years after splitting up in 1986 . After he revealed he felt the same way, things then moved so fast he walked out on his wife and ended up living in a tent near her back garden - without her other man knowing. Now, after their whirlwind reunion last year, the couple have moved into a rented house in Inverness-shire and are planning to get married in Gretna Green once his divorce comes through. They originally met at an Inverness disco in 1985 when Ms MacLean was 19 and Mr MacDonald was 16, but split after a year because he thought he was too young to settle. Both got married but Mr MacDonald could not forget his first true love, so he searched for her on Facebook. Ms MacLean, 47, told the Daily Mirror that Alex's first words to her were 'I've missed you. I've been looking for you for 26 years'. And even though he was married and Ms MacLean was in a new relationship after getting a divorce, they arranged to meet last year. How they were: Sue MacLean (left) as she was in the 1980s and (right) Alex MacDonald in his youth . Mr MacDonald, 44, drove 160 miles to her home in Banchory, Aberdeenshire, last August and they planned their future together. They decided that shop manager Ms MacLean would work out her month's notice and then they would run away together. But Mr MacDonald, unemployed at the time but now a supermarket worker, turned up at her workplace a few days later saying he had walked out of his marital home in Inverness and could not bear to be apart from her any longer. He brought his tent so he could be near her until they could be properly together and pitched in a wood near her back garden - unbeknown to her partner Stan Bain, 50. Still in love: Alex MacDonald and Sue MacLean are planning to marry in Gretna Green once his divorce comes through . Ms MacLean said: 'Living in a small tent - especially during the cold autumn nights - just to be near me was the most romantic thing anyone has ever done.' She walked out on Mr Bain three weeks later, leaving a note on the kitchen table saying she was getting back together with her ex. And the mother-of-two daughters aged 21 and 24 had a bombshell piece of news for Mr MacDonald related to their past. Ms MacLean revealed that she had discovered she was pregnant six weeks after he left her in 1986 - but had an abortion. He said: 'I was stunned. Maybe I would have stayed and we could have had a life and a child together.' Ms McLean's former partner, Mr Bain, has forgiven her for dumping him, although he said it would have been nicer to have been told in person that she was leaving rather than through a note. However, Mr MacDonald's jilted wife Val, 50, is less upbeat. She said: '[Ms McLean] stole my husband. 'She may have known him when they were younger, but I was his wife.'","Sue MacLean met Alex MacDonald, her former boyfriend of 25 years before... even though he was married and she was in a relationship .

Federal authorities investigating a devastating wildfire that has singed nearly 18,000 acres of Arizona have traced the inferno to a bachelor party celebration gone wrong. A Mesa man has been charged with starting a wildfire that burned nearly 18,000 acres after the blaze started on May 12. Federal prosecutors said Steven Craig Shiflet, 23, was target shooting with a group of friends as part of a bachelor party when he fired a 12-gauge shotgun loaded with a flame-shooting shell. Firestarter: Prosecutors say Craig Shiflet accidentally started the Sunflower Fire while at a bachelor party with friends . Federal documents obtained by TheSmokingGun.com said the five revelers at the bachelor party all told similar stories, with Shiflet admitting that he sparked the fire with the shot. Shiflet, of Mesa, admitted during an interview with investigators that shortly after firing the shot at a soda box, the group noticed smoke. The group tried to stomp out the fire but could not put out the flames, so they called 911 - and a police dispatcher told them to get away from the area. The group was identified by the licence plate of a car the group was seen fleeing in, a white GMC Yukon. Devastating: The Sunflower Fire was the largest of the blazes that have plagued Arizona during the 2012 wildfire season . During the interview with investigators on May 19, Shiflet handed over all of the guns he said were being used on May 11, including the Remington shotgun that he believed fired the 'incendiary' shell. He also turned over a Fiocchi 12-gauge shotgun shell that he claimed was identical to the one that sparked the fire. According to the report, a warning label on the ammunition read: 'Shoots 100 feet of fire, setting everything in its path ablaze. Warning: Extreme FIRE HAZARD.' He also led authorities to the place where he believed he shot the round, which was in the same area that fire investigation officials had identified as the location where the fire started. Firefight: Firefighters are hoping that monsoon storms will help contain the wildfires that have been burning for months . Shiflet faces three charges, each of which carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison and a $5,000 fine if he is convicted. The Smoking Gun reported that Shiflet was indicted on May 22, and will appear in court on July 13. The Sunflower Fire in the Tonto National Forest hasn't been active in weeks but remains 80 per cent contained. It was the largest of the state’s 2012 wildfire season, and has burned nearly 18,000 acres in the Tonto Forest.

Jailed: Christopher Lunn, 67, committed sex attacks on three different girls over more than 40 years . A paedophile has been jailed after the parents of an 11-year-old girl found a price list of sexual acts and financial rewards he had tried to bribe her with. Christopher Lunn, 67, committed sex attacks on three different girls over more than 40 years but was only caught when the schoolgirl’s hand written note was found in her room. Police then discovered that he had committed similar offences with young girls of the same age in the early 1970s and the mid 1980s after befriending their families and grooming his victims with treats. The note written by his most recent victim, from Exmouth, Devon, started: 'Touch £5, Feel £4, Video £10' then moved on to other sexual acts for which the reward was £10 or £35. In the past he had bribed other girls with sweets, crisps and chocolate, Exeter Crown Court was told. The abuse had devastating long term psychological effects on the historic victims, one of whom had met him by chance in a pub many years later and denounced him as 'a dirty little pervert'. Retired van driver Lunn, of Topsham, near Exeter, admitted sexual activity with a child and seven charges of indecency or indecent assault. He was jailed for seven years by Judge John Neligan who told him: 'Some of these offences go back 40 years and during those in the 1980s you bought the girl’s affection with chocolate. 'You took advantage of these young girls, some of whom are now mature ladies with families of their own. They have suffered psychologically from what you did to them as children.' Mr Sean Brunton, prosecuting, said Lunn was arrested after a family from Exmouth who he had befriended called the police. He said: 'The 11-year-old girl had gone upstairs with him on occasions and her parents found a note which said ‘touch £5, feel £4’ and carried on with other prices. In court: Exeter Crown Court was told Lunn had bribed girls before with chocolate, sweets and crisps in the 1970s and 1980s. He has been jailed for seven years . 'She then told her parents he had touched her through her knickers, although the note suggests it went further than that.' He said the parents then learned of an earlier incident in which Lunn had been confronted in a pub by a woman who he abused at the age of 11. They traced her and put her in touch with the police. A third woman later came forward to reveal she had been abused in the 1980s and given chocolate after being touched by Lunn. Mr Brunton said: 'He was arrested and interviewed and his account of his actions was a masterclass in denial, self justification and minimisation of what happened.' He said the older victims made statements detailing how the abuse had affected them in later life, making adult relationship difficult and in one case leading to agoraphobia. Mr David Evans, defending, said Lunn deserved credit for pleading guilty and sparing the victims the ordeal of giving evidence. He said: 'Many people in his position remain in denial but he has accepted his responsibility and is trying to understand why he did what he did. 'He is never again going to be in a position where he has any access to children and the sex offender register provisions will ensure the authorities keep a watchful eye on him.'","Christopher Lunn committed sex attacks on three different girls over more than 40 years .

Rupert Murdoch made a dig at the English as he announced plans to split News Corp into two companies . Rupert Murdoch criticised the English and vowed to take his money elsewhere as he announced the splitting up of his company. The billionaire media mogul said he was now 'a lot more reluctant' to invest in the UK 'because of the English'. Mr Murdoch was discussing the separation of News Corp into a film and TV entertainment company and one for publishing titles such as the Sun and the Times. The eighty-one year-old announced the . plan after a year of intense pressure from the phone hacking scandal at . the News of the World. But he denied the decision was a direct result of that and said there had been discussions about it for 'three years'. 'There are billions and billions of . dollars, and if Britain didn't want 'em, there are plenty of good places . to put them here [in the US]. I'm much more bullish about America than I . am about England,' he told Fox Business. 'I would be a lot more reluctant to invest in new things in Britain today, rather than here.' Asked if this was because of the phone . hacking revelations and the subsequent Leveson Inquiry, he said: 'No, . not at all, just the English.' But analysts were quick to point out that the News Corp was now more likely to be given approval to take control of BSkyB if it mounts a renewed bid for the broadcaster. Some saw the split as an attempt to distance the lucrative entertainment arm of the business from the newspaper division, which is under scrutiny over alleged phone hacking and payments to police. Mr Murdoch said it was 'highly . unlikely' his son Lachlan would be in charge of the publishing business, . responsible for titles including the Sun, the Times, the Wall Street . Journal, the Herald Sun and Harper Collins. Split: The News Corp board approved a plan to carve the conglomerate into distinct entertainment and publishing businesses . He said that business prospects in the . U.S. were 'more rosy' than the UK but warned against Barack Obama's . healthcare plan creating a 'culture of entitlement'. 'We've seen where it's taken Greece. We've seen where it's taken France and Spain today. So, on a political . level, I worry about it,' he added. Mr Murdoch said he will serve as . chairman of both new companies and CEO of the entertainment company. The . Murdoch family, which controls nearly 40 percent of the voting shares . in News Corp., is expected to maintain control of both companies. Divided: The production company 20th Century Fox (left) will be part of the new entertainment business, while Harper Collins (right) will be on the publishing side . News Corp.'s board unanimously . approved the split in principle. It will take a more formal look at the . plan's details in coming months. The separation is also subject to . regulatory approval and is expected to take about a year. The split of News Corp. is a symbolic . turning point for Mr Murdoch. Through the years, he maintained a . fondness for newspapers even as he bought  entertainment companies and . built a media conglomerate with a market value of $53 billion. He is known to have regularly called his newspaper editors and asked them: 'What's doing?' There were some fears among commentators that the Sun and Times could suffer without the financial support of a parent company. Politicians and public officials were now less likely to be held to account without such  established titles being able to investigate them, it is claimed. But investors have already applauded the . change. Since news of the split broke early Tuesday, News Corp. shares . are up 9 percent. They slipped 32 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $21.99 on . Thursday. News Corp. said existing shareholders . will get one share of stock in the publishing company for every News . Corp. share they own. The exact ratio could change. Each company would . maintain two classes of stock, voting shares and non-voting shares. Mr Murdoch is hoping the television . and movie company will be more highly valued by shareholders who had . been unwilling to accept the dour growth prospects of the newspaper and . book business. Chase Carey (left) is seen as the likely future CEO of the entertainment business, while Joel Klein (right) is a possible candidate to head the publishing business . But he now faces the challenge of making the publishing division attractive to investors. Taken as a whole, News Corp.'s . entertainment businesses are much more promising. In the nine months . through March, the combined cable channel, TV station, satellite TV and . movie businesses saw revenue rise 9 percent to $18.66 billion. Operating . profit rose 23 percent to $4.17 billion. By contrast, the publishing arm's . revenues and profits have been shrinking over the same period. Revenues . declined 4 percent to $6.22 billion while operating profits slipped 22 . percent to $458 million. Investors have long pestered News . Corp. to get rid of the newspaper business. Mr Murdoch acknowledged . yesterday that the idea has been discussed internally for more than . three years. Still, he said he rejects 'naysayers' who doubt the long-term future of the printed word. 'The answer is one word: it's . digital,' Murdoch said to analysts on a conference call. 'People are . buying pure papers printed on crushed wood, but they are equally getting . their news in many other forms.' Troubled: Murdoch's News Corp has been under pressure to spin off its newspaper business following the phone-hacking scandal . Even so, Murdoch plans to put money . behind those words. To address the concerns of future shareholders, he . promised that the publishing division will be split off with 'a robust . net cash position' to be used for potential acquisitions. News Corp. had $10.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of March. Analysts said the split will allow . Murdoch to pursue the newspaper business with the same fervor he had . when he began building his empire 60 years ago. It also contains the . possible damage from mistakes, such as the one he made when he overpaid . for Dow Jones & Co. in 2007. 'Once the companies are separated, . he'll be able to make acquisitions without upsetting the valuation of . the entertainment business,' said Alan Gould, an analyst with Evercore . Partners. 'I don't worry about the acquisitions he's doing 2 to 3 years . down the road in publishing.'","'It's not the phone hacking, it's the English,' says mogul .

A young mother was told her baby son had a condition that could potentially leave him brain damaged from a stranger on the internet. Charlotte Dent discovered six-month-old George had the rare condition trigonocephaly because a woman whose son has the same thing spotted the tell-tale signs on a Facebook profile picture. The woman spotted the ridge running down George's forehead - a sign that he has the condition. It is so serious that without an operation the one-year-old could be left permanently brain damaged. Charlotte, 22, who lives with George’s father - car factory worker Adam Knowles - in Fazakerley, Liverpool, said she was angry the condition was not spotted by doctors earlier. Relieved: Charlotte Dent and Adam Knowles with their son George Knowles, who they discovered had a rare skull condition from somebody who made the diagnosis over Facebook . She said she also wanted to tell other parents so babies affected could get the help they need. Charlotte said: 'My son is six months old and I found out that he has something quite rare. 'All the doctors I’ve been to see and even the health visitors haven’t picked up on this. It was a mum whose son has the same thing. 'If she hadn’t got in touch he could have ended up severely brain damaged. Unaware: Ms Dent had been using a picture of George on Facebook when one of her online friends spotted the signs of trigonocephaly - something her own son suffers from . 'All I want to do is raise awareness so other people can notice it and get something done before it’s too late.' When baby George was born Charlotte said she noticed that he had a misshapen head but he was checked over and given the all-clear. Trigonocephaly is the fusion of the two frontal parts of the skull, also known as the metopic suture. The metopic suture runs from the top of the head, at the fontanel or soft spot, down the center of the forehead to the nose. It is the only part of the skull that begins closing in infancy. In cases of Trigonocephaly, a ridge can be seen running down the center of the forehead and the fontanel is usually closed. Children with Trigonocephaly will have a forehead that looks narrow, and the child's eyes are often spaced closer together than is normal. The forehead will have a triangular shape, like the bow of a boat. Trigonocephaly affects between one in 2,500 to one in 3,500 babies. It can be difficult to diagnose the condition due to the the variations in severity. It is not known what precisely causes Trigonocephaly. However, the children of mothers who have taken Valproic Acid for seizures can be more at risk. It was thought after the birth his different head shape could be a sign of Down’s Syndrome but when he was checked by a pediatrician at Liverpool Women’s Hospital it was dismissed and he was discharged. After being warned that her son could have trigonocephaly she contacted a specialist at Alder Hey and received the diagnosis the same day. The condition is caused when the frontal part of the skull fuses together to produce a head shaped like the bow of a ship. Charlotte, who is on maternity leave from her admin job at a care agency, said if the condition goes unnoticed it can cause blindness, severe learning difficulties and in worst cases even death. Charlotte said: 'When he was diagnosed I was absolutely devastated, not only with the diagnosis but he will need a major operation at one year which will leave him with a scar from ear to ear which he will have for life. 'And if it hadn’t been noticed by this woman I dread to think what he would have gone through and what his life would have been like.' Craniofacial consultant Christian Duncan at Alder Hey said trigonocephaly was a very rare condition and often not picked up immediately. A spokeswoman for Liverpool Women’s Hospital said: 'We always take concerns relating to care provided by this Trust very seriously and where appropriate we will investigate thoroughly.'","Online friend of mother Charlotte Dent recognised symptoms of trigonocephalyin in Facebook picture of George .

"By . Steve Doughty . UPDATED: . 07:54 EST, 16 November 2011 . Lord Judge: Warned that European judges could ask English courts to disapply British statute for the first time . England's most senior judge yesterday warned the European Court of Human Rights against interfering too far in British law. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, said judges in Strasbourg could be about to make the extraordinary demand that British courts ignore laws set down by Parliament. He told MPs and peers that an imminent ruling ‘has huge implications’ and ‘could in effect call on us to disapply the 2003 Criminal Justice Act’. The looming showdown relates to the case of Imad Al-Khawaja, who was convicted of indecent assault in 2004. One witness gave evidence but died before his trial. A statement she made to police was read to the jury. Mr Al-Khawaja’s is now a test case over whether criminals can be convicted on the basis of so-called ‘hearsay’ evidence from witnesses who do not appear in court. British law says they can, and the principle has been backed by the Supreme Court. But Strasbourg’s final appeal body, the Grand Chamber, is thought to be likely to over-rule that decision with its own, due shortly. European human rights judges have regularly ordered Parliament to rethink its laws, as in the ongoing dispute over votes for prisoners. However, they are yet to order courts to actually ignore current statutes. Lord Judge told the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights that a decision to overrule the Supreme Court would amount to trespass on British independence and contravene the ‘margin of appreciation’ – the term for how much Strasbourg may interfere in domestic laws. Rights showdown: Grand Chamber is expected to rule that British courts should disapply the Criminal Justice Act 2003 . ‘If the decision is that [Al-Khawaja] had an unfair trial, then that decision will be a very good demonstration that the margin of appreciation is not being followed,’ he said. Lord Judge told the committee that the decision on whose law must be obeyed – that of Westminster or Strasbourg – will eventually go to the Supreme Court. ‘It will have to be resolved,’ he said. He also claimed that British courts had been following Strasbourg’s rulings too closely. ‘Most of the decisions are fact-specific decisions; they are not deciding any point of principle. They are just saying “here are the facts, here is the answer”. That is not precedent for anything,’ he said. ‘There has been a tendency to follow much more closely than I think we should.’ In addition, the Lord Chief Justice indicated that he fears European Union manoeuvres may remove any opportunity for British courts to defy Strasbourg. At present, the Human Rights Act states that courts should merely ‘take account’ of the court’s judgments. But the EU is negotiating to use its new constitutional powers, granted by the Lisbon Treaty, to become a member of the ECHR, with the same status as member nations. If it succeeds, the EU’s own European Court of Justice, which sits in Luxembourg, will be able to tell EU countries to follow the judgments of Strasbourg. Lord Judge said: ‘There is a difference between Luxembourg and Strasbourg. ‘Never mind take account of – we will be ordered to follow Strasbourg law because Luxembourg is following it.’","British courts could be told by European judges to ignore laws Acts of Parliament .

But for Amanda McGreavy, the sight of the flapping laundry was the final straw in a long-running dispute with her wealthy neighbours. Furious that her view of the countryside had been ‘deliberately’ blocked, she demanded the washing be taken down. Amanda McGreavy, who was in a planning dispute with her neighbour, found the countryside view from her window obstructed by Barry Winter's washing line directly opposite .

Above, Mrs McGreavy, with Mr Winter's house in the background . When neighbour Barry Winter refused, Mrs McGreavy moved her car to block access to his £450,000 executive home. Tempers flared, and when Mrs . McGreavy’s partner Roy Walker arrived, the two men clashed outside their . homes in the quiet cul-de-sac. Winter, 46, a £100,000-a-year power . station manager, punched Mr Walker, 53, to the ground before kicking him . in the face and ribs, Hull Crown Court was told. Hearing the commotion, . Mrs McGreavy’s son Christopher, 21, ran outside and was prodded in the . eye amid the chaos. Police were called and the washing line row landed Winter with a criminal conviction. The father of two of Howden, East Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm and assault. Mr Winter with his wife outside court yesterday. Barrister John Thackray said the father-of-two often worked long hours and was on call to work abroad, making it difficult to complete community punishment . The view from Mrs McGreavy's home which was spoiled by washing . He escaped jail but was ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work and pay £1,200 costs. His total legal bill was at least £5,200. Passing sentence, Judge Simon Jack . described the problem between the neighbours as ‘a very unfortunate set . of circumstances’. The court heard there had been a long-running . planning row that had soured relations between the two families. The . Winter family’s large detached home was built shortly after Mrs . McGreavy, 51, a sales rep, moved into her house opposite. The problems . began when the mother of two claimed her neighbour built a boundary wall . and gate partially on her land. Talking to the Mail outside court, Mrs . McGreavy said she became upset by the Winters’ habit of hanging their . washing in view of their front room, rather than on another less visible . area of their garden. Amanda McGreavy with her partner Roy Walker, who, along with Mrs McGreavy's 18-year-old son Christopher, was attacked by Mr Winter . At one point her former husband Keith, 54, told . Winter: ‘You take the washing line down or give us the land back.’ She . said he relented and removed the washing line. Peace returned to the . cul-de-sac until a row over a bonfire on Winter’s property on a summer’s . day three years ago. Police were called and Mrs McGreavy hired lawyers . to recover the parcel of land. The washing line soon returned to its . former spot and Mrs McGreavy said she was further annoyed by Winter . leaving three wheelie bins in the same line of view and slamming them at . night. On their side, the Winters are understood to have complained about damage to their property and set up CCTV as a result. Mrs McGreavy said she was treated in . hospital for high blood pressure linked to stress and was put on . anti-depressants because of her neighbour’s ‘harassment’. Meanwhile, the . planning problems continued. Winter re-positioned the boundary wall . because of the disputed patch of land and a planning application to . increase the height of the wall opposite Mrs McGreavy’s house was turned . down after she objected. She has now put her £275,000 house on the market. She said: ‘I have suffered harassment . for the last four years and have had enough. 'It has been a lot of silly . things, like deliberately hanging washing, including his wife’s . knickers, on the line to upset me, and setting the alarm off late at . night and leaving it going.’ Mrs McGreavy said on the day of the . incident last July she returned home after a drive and ‘snapped’ when . she saw the washing out. John Thackray, defending, told the court the offences followed ‘sustained and significant provocation’ from Mrs McGreavy. Commenting on the attack, which left . Mr Walker requiring stitches, he said: ‘He (Winter) was pushed to the . limit. He realises now his actions were in excess of self-defence.’ The judge said he took into account . Winter’s previous good character in passing a community order. He added: . ‘I want to make it clear that a substantial part of the blame lies with . the other neighbour as much as yourself.’ But Mrs McGreavy remained defiant: ‘I . think the sentence is a joke and he should have gone to prison. Justice . has not been done.’ Winter declined to comment.","Amanda McGreavy objected to height of line outside Barry Winter's house .

Its report released last month in Washington D.C. was intended to look at how to tighten the border with Canada to improve security.

Breathalysers: David Nutt says every motorist should be forced to take a breath test before setting off in his new book . A former Government chief drugs adviser who controversially claimed Ecstasy is safer than drink has said alcohol sensors should be fitted in every car. Professor David Nutt said all motorists would have to breathe into a device to prove they were not over the limit before their vehicle would start. But the call was today dismissed as 'impractical' by the AA. The controversial professor was sacked as the Government chief drugs adviser three years ago after claiming that drink was more harmful than Ecstasy. He also suggested that riding a horse was more dangerous than taking the banned Class A drug. The alcohol sensors plan is one of seven . ways he suggests to reduce the harm caused by alcohol in his new book, . Drugs - Without The Hot Air. Other suggestions include shorter . licensing hours, compelling pubs and supermarkets to sell non-alcoholic . lagers and beers alongside alcoholic drinks, and devising less dangerous . alternatives such as drinks which give people a moderate 'buzz'. Prof Nutt is president of the British Neuroscience Association and a professor at Imperial College, London. He told the BBC that some countries use the in-car breath-testers, known as alcohol ignition interlock devices, to ensure that people convicted of drink-driving do not take to the wheel, but he had an even more 'radical' idea. He said: 'You could potentially have it so that was true of all cars - everybody would have to breathe in (to the device) before they were able to drive away. Alcolock: A motorist blows into an in-car breathalyser attached to the ignition. The car will not start unless the driver successfully passes . 'You hear about terrible accidents when four or five young people die simultaneously in the one car because the driver’s been drunk. It could save a lot of lives.' Professor Nutt has long courted controversy. Under his stewardship, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs resisted the reclassification of cannabis and also called for Ecstasy to be downgraded to a Class B substance. On both occasions he was overruled by ministers. But it was a paper he authored for the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King's College, London, that proved the final straw. He accused former home secretary Jacqui Smith, who reclassified cannabis, of 'distorting and devaluing' scientific research, and said smoking the drug created a 'relatively small risk' of psychotic illness. He also claimed those who wanted to move Ecstasy into Class B from Class A - including himself - had 'won the intellectual argument'. Most controversially, Professor Nutt said all drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, should be ranked by a 'harm' index - with drinking coming fifth behind cocaine, heroin, barbiturates, and methadone. Alcolocks - which Prof Nutt wants fitted to all cars - are attached to the ignition . and do not allow the driver to start the engine until they have . successfully blown into a tube. Drunk crash: A National Express coach on its side on a slip road off the M1 near Milton Keynes. Driver Leslie Weinberg was jailed . However, . critics have pointed to the fact that it is ludicrous to make all . drivers blow into a tube every time they start a journey. The . system will also fail to catch the most determined drunk drivers who . could get a sober person - or even a child - to take the test for them. National Express began introducing the devices to their coaches last year to ensure their drivers are never over the limit. Bosses took action after drunk driver . Leslie Weinberg injured 33 passengers by flipping a coach onto its side . as he left a motorway services on the M1 near Milton Keynes, . Buckinghamshire, in September 2007. The driver, who was one-and-a-half times the drink drive limit was jailed for ten months. AA president Edmund King said today that introducing alcolocks to all cars was not a sensible idea. 'There is a voluntary scheme of ""alcolocks"" at the moment but I don’t think Prof Nutt’s plan is practical,' he said. 'Our message is that no one who drives should drink. If that message gets across and the police target drink-drivers and breathalyse more people, then you don’t need new devices. 'In France, drivers have to carry a breathalyser in the car. The problem here is that you could be under the legal drink-drive limit when you set off and then over the limit half an hour later, as it takes time for alcohol to get into the bloodstream.'","AA dismiss plans to force all drivers to take test before setting off as 'impractical'

Scrutinised: Journalists crowded round the player as he trudged into court with this hands deep in his pockets . Entourage: John Terry and supporters arrive at Westminster Magistrates' court this morning . The Premier League defender is said to have reacted after Ferdinand . accused him of ‘s******* Bridge’s missus’ – a reference to his . relationship with Miss Perroncel who was dating his former colleague, . Wayne Bridge. Evidence: Anton Ferdinand leaves the court yesterday with friends . The incident came in front of 20,000 fans – as well as a TV audience of . two million – in a clash between Terry’s Chelsea and Ferdinand’s Queens . Park Rangers on October 23 last year. The row began after Terry failed to return the ball to QPR during the . last few minutes of a tense game at the latter team’s ground in West . London. Annoyed, Ferdinand began to make lewd ‘fist-pumping’ hand . gestures at 31-year-old Terry. His opponent understood the gesture to ‘refer to the well-publicised . allegation’ that he had had ‘an extra-marital affair with a team-mate’s . wife’, prosecutor Duncan Penny said. In response, Terry began shouting at Ferdinand, using a string of swear . words, Mr Penny said. The prosecutor added: ‘The words were abusive and . insulting in a straightforward sense.’ They were ‘uttered as an abusive insult demonstrating hostility based on Mr Ferdinand’s membership of a racial group’. Ferdinand said he had not heard the word ‘black’ – only swear words that he reacted to by raising the issue of Terry’s affair. After the game, Terry called Ferdinand to his team’s changing room, . where he is alleged to have said: ‘It’s handbags innit – it’s what . happens on the pitch.’ The pair shook hands but – after watching footage of the incident with . his then girlfriend – Ferdinand believed that Terry had made a racist . comment and became ‘livid’ over what had happened. No special treatment: Terry was ordered to take his place in the dock after his lawyer asked if he could sit beside him . In the dock: John Terry watches on as his alleged race abuse victim Anton Ferdinand gives evidence in this artist's impression of proceedings . Watching: Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered teenager Stephen, arrived at court yesterday with Ferdinand's mother Janice . When he was questioned by police over the incident, Terry admitted using . a racist jibe but claimed he had said it ironically, believing . Ferdinand had just accused him of making that same remark. ‘Whilst footballers are used to industrial language, saying racist terms . is completely unacceptable whatever the situation,’ he said. ‘I was . completely taken aback by this remark as I have never been accused of . something like that.’ The England defender added that he had not been offended by the taunts . about his alleged affair, because ‘it’s not the first time I’ve heard . it, so it’s with a pinch of salt’. Terry, a married father of two who earns £160,000 a week, denies a . racially aggravated public order offence, which carries a maximum fine . of £2,500. Fraternal affection: Rio Ferdinand tweeted support to his brother Anton ahead of the hearing . More than 100 photographers and cameramen lined the entrance to the West London Court awaiting his arrival yesterday morning. Wearing a tailored grey suit and pink tie, he was bundled by his . security team through a side door to avoid the huge crowd of press and . public at the front of the court. Scandal: Terry's alleged comments came in response to taunts by the other player about his alleged affair with an ex-team-mate's girlfriend, Vanessa Perroncel, pictured, the prosecution said . At the start of the hearing, the England player asked if he could sit . next to his barrister rather than in the dock. Chief magistrate Howard . Riddle rejected his request although he briefly permitted him to leave . the dock so he could watch as footage of the incident was played to the . court. Giving evidence yesterday, Ferdinand said: ‘When someone brings your . colour into it, it takes it to another level and it’s very hurtful.’ But he said he had initially avoided giving a statement to police . because he wanted the incident to be dealt with by officials at the . Football Association. ‘This is a footballing issue that happened on the football pitch where . we work,’ he said. He denied a suggestion that he went to police only . when persuaded to by his publicist Justin Rigby, who also works for Rio. Ferdinand said: ‘No, I made up my own mind, I wanted to do it.’ The decision to investigate the former England captain was taken when . police received a complaint from a member of the public after the . Premier League match. A lip reader gave evidence saying she had studied the footage and confirmed the use of the word ‘black’. Terry, whose Chelsea team won the Champions League and the FA Cup in . May, was part of the England side that reached the quarter finals of . Euro 2012 last month. He was stripped of the national team’s captaincy . for a second time this February after the date for his race row trial . was set. Ferdinand has played for West Ham, Sunderland and QPR.

An axe-wielding man went on a destruction spree causing nearly £50,000 worth of damage after a row with his fiancee over a Valentine's Day card. Paul Hyde, 46, used a four-foot axe to destroy cars and homes in a quiet street in Billericay, Essex, as terrified homeowners barricaded themselves inside. He has been jailed after admitting threatening to kill residents on the street following the break-up of his year-long whirlwind romance with Alison Hall. Basildon Crown Court heard how Hyde's violent rage was triggered by an argument with his now ex-fiancee when he went to collect his belongings from her home the day after Valentine's this year. Miss Hall had dumped him by text for 'not showing enough gratitude' for the Valentine's Day card she had given him the day before. When Miss Hall arrived home from work shortly after 5pm she found Hyde swallowing paracetamol tablets whilst downing whisky. A heated argument ensued and Hyde threatened to kill Miss Hall but she managed to wriggle free of his grip and fled the property. Hyde then grabbed a four-foot axe from the house and began his costly destruction spree by smashing his way into the house of her 49-year-old neighbour Pauline Hilton. He bashed Ms Hilton around the face before holding the axe across her throat as her terrified daughter Gemma Hilton, 27, locked herself in the upstairs bathroom and called police. His rampage then spilled out into the street where he began violently hacking at parked cars and front doors as terrified neighbours watched on in horror. Hyde's rampage of destruction - which caused a total of £48,000 worth of damage - was eventually ended when armed police used rubber bullets to disarm him. Damaged: Up to 10 cars and vans were attacked in the street in Billericay . The rampage lasted around 20 minutes - causing thousands of pounds' worth of damage before police could stop Hyde .

Jailing Hyde for four-and-a-half years for 18 separate offences on Thursday, Judge David Owen-Jones told him: 'You simply lost it. You went on a rampage with the axe and threatened lots of your neighbours. 'Everyone involved in this terrible incident has been psychologically affected and it has devastated a neighbourhood. 'You threatened to kill your ex-partner and she must have been terrified out of her wits. 'You did not stop and went from house to house threatening neighbours with the axe. What you did was simply unbelievable.' Victim Pauline Hilton attended court on Thursday and spoke after Hyde's sentencing about the devastating effect the attack has had on their quiet neighbourhood. She said: 'No amount of time for a sentence will compare to the utter trauma we've been through. 'We've been so impacted by this and it's something none of us will ever forget but you have to try to move on. 'Everyone involved has been psychologically affected and it has devastated a neighbourhood.'

In a declaration filed on Thursday Pinto-Walsh said: 'The establishment of the museum was very important to Thomas,' the LA Times reported. 'He went to great lengths to describe . for me and to show me his vision for the museum. It is my every . intention to see that his wishes are carried out.' The painter was married to Nanette Kinkade for more than 30 years and had four daughters together. Pinto-Walsh, who was called a gold-digger by the estranged Mrs Kinkade, said after the painter’s death that the two were planning to wed after his divorce was finalised. In April, lawyers portrayed Mr . Kinkade's girlfriend as a ruthless gold digger who is out to 'tear down' the late artist's reputation and do irreparable damage to his family. The . restraining order against Amy Pinto-Walsh claimed she broke a . confidentiality agreement by talking to reporters the morning Mr Kinkade . was found dead and threatened to reveal his business and personal . secrets. The artist's . bodyguard - who drove him around after he was caught drink driving - . said the family had reason to fear Pinto-Walsh because she was prone to . 'impulsive and erratic' behavior and once threatened to 'tear Mr Kinkade . down'. 'Amy was already part of his circle of friends and that really enraged Nanette,' an unnamed source told Radar Online. Will and testament: The will was written on notepaper and is barely legible . 'Nanette was furious and humiliated that he not only cheated on her, but moved on so quickly and publicly with her.' She didn't make any attempt to hide . her frustration either, as she filed a restraining order against his . mistress shortly after his death, wanting to stop her from breaching a confidentiality agreement she signed more than a year ago. The so-called 'Painter of Light' used to estimate that around one out of every 20 homes in America. His estate - of which Mrs Kinkade is . the principal trustee - has filed documents with a Santa Clara court . seeking an injunction against Ms Pinto-Walsh, according to Los Gatos . Patch. Painter of light: Mr Kinkade's talent, shown here in Living Waters: Golfer's Paradise, Hole One is a characteristic of his serene style that put roughly one of his paintings in every 20 homes . Success: Mr Kinkade's works were popular, but his battle with alcoholism led him to an arrest for DUI (right) Mr Kinkade died of accidental acute intoxication from alcohol . and an anti-anxiety medication, an autopsy report revealed. The . Santa Clara County Coroner's Office reported Kinkade's cause of death . as 'acute ethanol and Diazepam intoxication' and manner of death as . 'accident,' according to NBC Bay Area. Diazepam is the active ingredient in name-brand drug Valium. Kinkade, whose works captivated . millions of Americans despite the scorn of many art critics, died in . April at his home in Northern California at the age of 54. The coroner’s report also said the painter suffered from ‘hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease.’ Father: Mr Kinkade, pictured here drawing his daughter Winsor, was said by his brother to have been cleaning himself up to remain in his children's lives . In layman’s terms, Kinkade had high blood pressure and thickened artery walls in his heart due to high cholesterol. His . brother told the San Jose Mercury News newspaper that the painter had . battled alcoholism for several years and suffered a relapse before he . died. Patrick Kinkade said . his brother had been burdened in recent years by a separation from his . wife, financial troubles and the low opinion of his work by critics. Thomas Kinkade was arrested for drunk driving in 2010, the same year his company filed for bankruptcy. Art galleries reported a surge in sales of Kinkade's paintings following his death.","Painter split from wife Nanette in 2010 and moved in with Amy Pinto-Walsh .

"PUBLISHED: . 22:07 EST, 13 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:07 EST, 13 June 2012 . Photographs have emerged capturing a year in the life of John F Kennedy as he fought a bitter and exhausting presidential campaign in 1960. Looking pensively through an aeroplane window, laughing with his three-year-old daughter Caroline and leaping from the back of an open-top car, the man who would become America's second-youngest president showed off the star quality combined with down-to-earth charm that beat rival Richard Nixon. The race for the White House in 1960 was tough, with voters focused on how to rebuild the economy following the Second World War, the Cuban crisis and the Space Race. Leap of faith: John F Kennedy on the campaign trail in 1960, jumping from an open-top car in New York . American dream: JFK, alone on his private plane, fought one of the closest campaigns in American history against Richard Nixon . Kennedy fought hard across all 50 states with his vice-presidential candidate Lyndon Johnson, shaking hands and wooing voters with passionate campaign speeches. Compared the high security surrounding presidential nominees today at times he often appears to stand alone at the center of clamoring crowds. The effect that 43-year-old war hero Kennedy had on female voters was well-documented. As it was reported in the last edition of Life Magazine before Americans went to the polls: 'The blissful fog of feminine adoration surrounding Jack Kennedy - the great phenomenon of the 1960 campaign - grew even thicker in the last days of his tour.' At the time of her husband's run for the White House, Jacqueline Kennedy was just 31 years old but quickly enthralled the American public with her beauty and poise. The Kennedy image proved one of the secrets to the success of his campaign. A turning point in the race came when the candidates went head to head in the first televised presidential debate in history. Queen of Camelot: Jacqueline Kennedy, 31, looks regal in opera gloves as she watches her husband sworn in as President on January 20, 1961 . Luck be a lady: Many political commentators noted the effect that the youthful and heroic JFK had on his female voters - young and old . While Kennedy appeared relaxed and at home in front of the camera, Richard Nixon seemed uncomfortable and out of touch. Still the last legs of the race were closely run - Kennedy beat Nixon to the White House with 49.7 per cent of the vote to Nixon's 49.5 per cent. John F Kennedy became the 35th President at noon on January 20, 1961. He led the country until he was tragically assassinated while driving through Dallas in November 1963, collapsing in the back of his car, into his wife’s blood-splattered arms.

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 10:18 EST, 5 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:17 EST, 5 July 2012 . Under investigation: Former France Telecom chief executive Didier Lombard was questioned yesterday . The former chief of France Telecom was yesterday put under investigation over his alleged role in a wave of suicides by staff. Didier Lombard was head of the telecoms company when when more than 30 employees committed suicide in 2008 and 2009, a decade after its privatisation. Following a complaint from trade unions, he has now been accused of advocating management practices that were so tough they amounted to psychological harassment, his lawyer said yesterday. He was released under court surveillance on bail of 100,000 euros (£80,000) after being questioned for four hours by two investigating magistrates. Lombard stepped down as France Telecom CEO in early 2010 amid criticism of his handling of the crisis. The company had suspended its restructuring plans the year before amid an outcry. Yesterday he issued a statement in the prominent French national newspaper Le Monde proclaiming his innocence. 'I forcefully reject the idea that (restructuring) plans vital to the survival of the company might have been the cause of human tragedies,' he said. The former CEO added: 't no point were these plans conceived and put in place by France Telecom directed against employees. 'They were meant to save the company and its employees, and to open up new career paths in the new digital world.' Lombard's lawyer, Jean Veil, said his client had not been given a chance to explain himself fully. Mr Veil said Lombard sought to clarify the context of his actions by referring to tough economic conditions and pressure exerted by the government, a minority stakeholder. Unions said harsh practices including forced moves and impossible performance targets were partly behind the rash of suicides. Many of France Telecom's workers had protected status making it difficult to fire them. The company instead gave them meaningless jobs to force them out, driving some to suicide, unions said. France Telecom had countered by saying the suicide rate was no higher than in the general population. Nevertheless, many of those who killed themselves left notes blaming work pressures, the BBC reported. Yet the former CEO, who was succeeded by Stephane Richard, said after stepping down that he regretted not taking measures earlier than he had to boost staff morale at the company, which employs 100,000. In February 2010, government labour inspectors wrote in a report on the suicides that France Telecom had ignored warnings from doctors about the mental health of certain employees. The report, seen by Reuters, pointed to a restructuring plan that sought to reduce headcount by 22,000 and put 10,000 other workers in new positions as having a 'pathological effect' on staff morale. 'In this case, Mr Didier Lombard is being accused of harassment against people that he never met,' Mr Veil said. 'That is a stunning accusation.' If found guilty of harassment, Lombard could face up to one year in prison and a 15,000-euro fine. Two other former senior executives at France Telecom have been summoned by investigating magistrates.","Thirty members of staff killed themselves during Didier Lombard's time at the top of the company .

"By . Daniel Bates . PUBLISHED: . 10:39 EST, 2 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:38 EST, 3 July 2012 . CNN anchor and talk show host Anderson Cooper has publicly revealed he's gay for the first time . Anderson Cooper has thanked fans for their support after his decision to come out as gay. The CNN news anchor was in Botswana filming when his sexuality was made public for the first time. Cooper wrote on Twitter: 'I appreciate all the nice tweets. I am in Botswana working but want to wish everyone a great 4th of July!' In an interview published yesterday, the journalist bluntly stated: 'The fact is, I'm gay'. He said that he did not want people to think he is 'trying to hide something' and that he is 'proud' of who he is. In candid comments he said that he was taking a stand because 'the tide of history only advances when people make themselves fully visible'. The 45-year-old added he was moved by recent events such as Barack Obama's endorsement of gay marriage - and hopes his example will put an end to bullying. Cooper's sexuality has long been an open secret in TV circles, but for him to state it publicly is a brave and bold move. He is also one of the most high profile people to come out in recent years, given that he hosts CNN's 'Anderson Cooper 360' and his own daytime TV talk show. Cooper came out by giving permission for friend  Andrew Sullivan, who is openly gay, to print an email exchange between them on the Daily Beast. In it he said: 'The fact is, I'm gay, always have been, always will be, and I couldn't be any more happy, comfortable with myself, and proud. 'I have always been very open and honest about this part of my life with my friends, my family, and my colleagues. Cooper has frequently been photographed with Benjamin Maisani, seen here shopping in the West Village with the news man in May 2010 . 'I love, and I am loved' he told Sullivan in the Monday letter. Here he and Benjamin ride bikes through New York city in July of 2010 . 'In a perfect world, I don't think it's anyone else's business, but I do think there is value in standing up and being counted. 'I'm not an activist, but I am a human being and I don't give that up by being a journalist.' Anderson says he was distressed he may be giving the impression that he had something to hide, when in fact he has lived openly among family and friends . In the interview, Cooper added that he did not address his sexuality in his memoir which he wrote in 2006 because it was about war reporting and he 'didn't set out to write about other aspects of my life'. He also long thought that being a . journalist he should not become the story, so did not respond 'even when . I've been directly asked the 'gay question''. What changed is that Cooper now worries that he could be setting a bad example by not being honest with the public. He said: 'Recently I've begun to consider whether the unintended outcomes of maintaining my privacy outweigh personal and professional principle. 'It's become clear to me that by remaining silent on certain aspects of my personal life for so long, I have given some the mistaken impression that I am trying to hide something - something that makes me uncomfortable, ashamed or even afraid. 'This is distressing because it is simply not true. 'I've also been reminded recently that while as a society we are moving toward greater inclusion and equality for all people, the tide of history only advances when people make themselves fully visible. Anderson, seen left in 1969 in Southampton, is the youngest son of Gloria Vanderbilt. Here is pictured with brother Carter, who committed suicide when he was 23 . Anderson, here with brother Carter and his mom in 1976, is the youngest of Gloria's four sons . Father and son: Anderson Cooper, right, as a boy with his father, writer Wyatt Emory Cooper, who died of heart disease in January 1978 at 50 . 'There continue to be far too many . incidences of bullying of young people, as well as discrimination and . violence against people of all ages, based on their sexual orientation, . and I believe there is value in making clear where I stand.'

(Posting a photo)Neil Patrick Harris Good for you, @AndersonCooper. You're awesome. Cooper's . comments appear to be a reference to the case of Tyler Clementi, the . Rutgers University student who was spied on by his roommate whilst . having sex with a man and then killed himself. He . also suggested that Mr Obama's backing of gay marriage may have made a . difference, as did the decision to allow gay couples in New York to . marry. Cooper said that on balance he came out . because 'visibility is important, more important than preserving my . reporter's shield of privacy'. His going public will be old news to . some, especially those who know him in New York where he has been a . regular fixture at gay pride events for years. Celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres, Don Lemon, Kelly Ripa and Joan Rivers took to Twitter today to show their support for Cooper. Most people tweeted that they were proud of him for coming out or called him an inspiration. Actor Kathy Griffin posted a photo of herself and Cooper holding hands while sunbathing and said 'Here I am w/ my friend @andersoncooper who I'm so proud of.' Joan Rivers tweeted: 'Thrilled @AndersonCooper came out! So, . THAT’S why he never wanted to date me! I would’ve loved having Gloria . Vanderbilt as my mother-in-law.' Cooper is said to be dating long term . boyfriend Benjamin Maisani, who runs a bar called Eastern Bloc in . Manhattan, and the two share his converted fire station home in . Greenwich Village. The pair have frequently been photographed together, but never at a public event. In an apparent reference to his relationship, he said in the interview: 'While I feel very blessed to have had so many opportunities as a journalist, I am also blessed far beyond having a great career. 'I love, and I am loved.' Cooper's disclosure is the latest twist in his eventful life as one of the Vanderbilt family, one of the most famous dynasties America has ever seen. The bar owner, seen here leaving David Barton Gym in 2010, reportedly lives with Cooper in his converted fire house . Anderson recently moved into this firehouse in Greenwich Village that he bought and renovated . His brother Carter, a Princeton . graduate, killed himself at the age of 23 by jumping off the family's New . York penthouse balcony two decades ago. Close bond: Anderson and his mom in 2010 . Cooper . and his 87-year-old mother, former fashion designer Gloria Vanderbilt, . spoke about the tragedy for the first time last September in his talk . show 'Anderson'. At the time . he was praised for talking in such an honest way about suicide, and his . latest disclosure is likely to earn him similar plaudits. Cooper . is the latest of a growing number of celebrities who have come out in a . more relaxed fashion than gay people have in the past. Star Trek actor Zachary Quinto revealed his sexuality in an interview with New York magazine in which he casually mentioned it when being quizzed about bullying, as if everyone knew already. He said: 'As a gay man I look at that and say there's a hopelessness that surrounds it, but as a human being I look at it and say 'Why? 'Where's this disparity coming from, and why can't we as a culture and society dig deeper to examine that?' We're terrified of facing ourselves.' The Big Bang Theory's Jim Parsons also revealed he was gay in a New York Times profile which mentioned his sexuality near the end, adding he had been in a relationship for 10 years. 1967 - born Anderson Hays Cooper on June 3 to mother, heiress Gloria Vanderbilt and father, writer Wyatt Emory Cooper. 1970 - appears as guest on the Tonight show aged three with his mother. 1977 -  joins Ford Models, starts three year stint as Ralph Lauren model.1978 - Cooper’s father dies of a heart attack aged 50 whilst undergoing open heart surgery.1970s - 80s - attends exclusive Dalton School in New York then Yale.

Frustrated: David Cameron said sport in state schools was being 'squeezed out' Too many of Britain's Olympic athletes went to public schools, David Cameron said yesterday as he called for barriers to be broken so all children could achieve their sporting potential. The Prime Minister claimed that fee-paying schools were producing 'more than their fair share' of medal winners while sport in state schools was being 'squeezed out' with rundown facilities and children lacking ambition. At the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, almost 40 per cent of Great Britain's medal winners had been privately educated – and that rose to 100 per cent of winners in equestrian events. With about a third of the 2012 squad expected to have been educated privately, Mr Cameron lamented the numbers of top sportsmen from less well-off backgrounds. He said: 'Sport can change lives. So why is it that in so many schools sport has been squeezed out and facilities run down? 'The result is that independent schools produce more than their fair share of medal winners and too many children think taking part in sport just isn't for them. We've got to change that.'

'Getting young people to follow their heroes and take part at school and in their local clubs.' His . comments came after Education Secretary Michael Gove warned that a . 'profoundly unequal' education system meant that private school pupils . were dominating positions of wealth and power in Britain. The Prime Minister went on to claim that the Olympics, which have so far cost £9.3billion, would boost the economy by £13billion over the next four years from new business deals, foreign investment and tourism. Downing Street said the figure included £1billion in additional sales by British companies, up to £4billion in business opportunities, £6billion in foreign investment, and £2billion from an increase of about four million tourists. Mr Cameron said: 'Now there's a further reason why the Games have got to be great for Britain too – they should be great for our economy. 'We shouldn't see them as some sort of expensive luxury in tough times. Because it's precisely because times are tough that we have got to get everything we can out of these Games, to support jobs and to support growth in the economy.'

The body of Eva Rausing may have lain undiscovered for four weeks as her loyal housemaid prevented anyone from entering her bedroom. Her body was only found when police forced their way past a Filipino employee shouting ‘out of bounds, out of bounds’ as they searched for drugs. They were alerted by a strong smell of decomposition after arriving at the sprawling £70million Georgian mansion several hours after arresting her husband. Grim discovery: Police found the badly decomposed body of Eva Rausing, right, several hours after arresting her husband Hans Kristian Rausing, left . Investigators now suspect Mrs Rausing, 48, may have died as long as four weeks before the grim discovery a week ago. They are studying CCTV, banking and phone records, as well as statements from friends and neighbours, to try to identify her last movements. Her sister Be, 47, said she travelled to London from the U.S. at the beginning of June but could not find her, despite banging on her bedroom door. She said: ‘The housekeeper let me in and I went upstairs to her bedroom and I was knocking on the door and texting her and calling out to her and there was no reply. ‘I think my sister was in there, passed away. I’d been worrying for weeks. I suspected something awful had happened.’ Prelude to a tragedy: Eva and Hans Rausing at a Windsor polo match with her sister Be and her fiance polo player Jack Kidd in 2000 . £70 million home: Police outside the Rausing's London mansion in Cadogan Place where Eva was found dead .

Let go: Yoga instructor Alice Van Ness has been fired for her disapproving stink-eye glare at a Facebook employee using a cellphone in class . A yoga instructor was fired for her ‘strict’ behaviour after enforcing her no cell phone policy at a class at Facebook’s Menlo Park campus earlier this month. Alice Van Ness, who has been teaching yoga for years, has always kept her policy – cell phones turn off when her classes begin. But according to the San Francisco Chronicle, Ms Van Ness was let go last month after asking a Facebook employee at the California campus to shut off her phone mid-class. The Facebook employee complained to Ms Van Ness’ contracting company, Plus One Health Management, who decided to terminate her. She said in the complaint that Ms Van Ness glared at her, though the yoga instructor said it was nothing more than a 'disapproving look.' Plus One Health said at the time: ‘We are in the business of providing great customer service,’ her notice read, according to the Chronicle. ‘Unless a client requires us to specifically say no to something, we prefer to say yes whenever possible.’ Increasingly, yoga studios across the country have posted strict no-phone policies amid a new generation of smart phone users addicted to checking emails, Twitter, the news, and Facebook. Ms Van Ness said she initially asked all people in the class at Facebook to turn off any electronic devices before she began. But the Facebook employee in the front of the class could not bear to be out of the know for the entirety of the class, and attempted to check it halfway through the session. Stretch it out: Yoga instructor Alice Van Ness, left, instructs students Wednesday, July 11, 2012, at Lifestretch Yoga  in Milpitas, California . Though Ms Van Ness said she only gave the employee a disapporiving look, that was enough for the worker to file a complaint. ‘I’m sure my look said it all,’ she told the paper. ‘Really? Your email is more important than understanding your body?’ She told MailOnline: 'She just thought what was going on at work was more important than yoga, or being there at the time. It's fine if you've got something going on, life still happens, but you're allowed to leave.' She said she thought it was the least disruptive way of handling it at the time. 'I handled it how I handled it. I’m the teacher. It’s done. 'I don’t think I did anything wrong. I have to stand by my beliefs. That’s the kind of environment I want, and that’s what I have to hold on to.' The yoga instructor has had brush-in’s with tech-oriented clientele. At Cisco, she had to tell an employee not to take pictures of fellow workers during class. Nonstop: Employees work at their computers at the Facebook main campus in Menlo Park, California; Ms Van Ness said that tech types are often too tightly wound for yoga . Representatives for Plus One Health Management did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment. Facebook simply said: 'Alice Van Ness was not an employee of Facebook, so we are not able to discuss this matter.' Van Ness said losing the job meant losing a third of her monthly income. But she secured a part-time office job in the mornings, allowing her to teach yoga to children, small classes, and private clients. 'I don’t think I did anything wrong. I have to stand by my beliefs. That’s . the kind of environment I want, and that’s what I have to hold on to.' She told MailOnline that in this day and age, many people could use the hour or so of silence that yoga allows. 'I love to go in on lunchtime and give people that break. It’s so rewarding to walk into an office, and they take an hour and they’ve taken that time for themselves,' she said. 'I feel like the people in corporate environments are so over-taxed and over-stimulated and have a lot of obligations and responsibilities.' That hour, she explained, allows people the 'space to connect and do what they need to do, and what's healthy for them.' And she's keeping her yoga classes cell-phone free.","Alice Van Ness taught yoga to Silicon Valley tech companies like Cisco and Facebook .

Seventy-six Eurocrats spent part of a top-level meeting deciding what to name a corridor - and even failed to reach a decision, it has emerged. This was even though a name had already been proposed and just needed signing off. In a shocking example of Brussels wasteful bureaucracy, the decision over the naming of one of the corridors in the Altiero Spinelli building had to be referred to a committee. Critics have branded it another example of how 'detached from reality' Eurocrats are. The request had been made to name the corridor 'The Baltic Way', after a peaceful 1989 mass protest against Soviet Rule, minutes of the May 9 meeting showed. European Parliament president Martin Schulz was even present at the Bureau meeting. But bungling officials could not come to a conclusion and passed the issue on to a committee who have been told to report back. Tory MP Philip Davies said the Eurocrats were 'detached from reality'. Head of the UK Independence Party Nigel Farage told The Sun: 'This is straight out of TV's Yes, Prime Minister. It's about fighting over support of a couple of Baltic MEPs.' In June it was revealed how it cost nearly half a million pounds to send five Eurocrats to the Earth Summit in Rio. The European Commission said it cost £475,000 to send officials, including their president José Manuel Barroso, along with an entourage of over 60 to the Rio+20 conference. The high financial costs were revealed in an answer to a parliamentary question submitted by London Conservative MEP Marina Yannakoudakis. Mrs Yannakoudakis, who is a member of the European Parliament’s environment committee, condemned the decision to send such a large delegation. She said: 'The Rio+20 Summit may address important issues, but the EU needs to be mindful of the costs of sending so many officials halfway across the world. The Altiero Spinelli building in Brussels in which Eurocrats were asked to name a corridor, however, they failed to come up with a solution and referred the matter to a committee and asked for a report back . 'At a time of austerity, we must ask ourselves was it really necessary to send five European Commissioners and their entourages to Rio. Saving the planet shouldn’t cost the earth.' Earlier this year it was also revealed that Baroness Ashton, the EU's foreign policy chief, was among one of the Eurocrats eligible for the use of private jets to fly them to meetings around the world. Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, and Herman van Rompuy, president of the European Council, are among other dignitaries who will benefit from the agreement with Belgian firm Abelag. At a cost of £10million for the next four years, they are able to use a choice of aircraft, including the Falcon 7X jet and Boeing 737, when they travel abroad for EU business. Peaceful demonstration: The Baltic Way's human chain . The Baltic Way - which has also come to be known as the Baltic Chain or Chain of Freedom - was a peaceful political demonstration that took place on August 23, 1989. An estimated two million people across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - which at the time were part of the Soviet Union - joined their hands to form a human chain more than 370 miles long. It marked the 50th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the USSR and Nazi Germany, which split up Eastern Europe and led to the occupation of the Baltic states in 1940. The protest, organised by Baltic pro-independence movements, was designed to bring the issue of independence to global attention. The event presented an opportunity for the Baltic activists to claim that the Soviet occupation was illegal. Within six months, Lithuania became the first of the Republics of the Soviet Union to declare independence.","It was discussed at a top-level meeting usually intended to discuss strategy .

Spain's king and his family are to take a pay cut as part of the latest round of austerity measures meted out by the country's government. The royal family's popularity has waned in recent months after a series of scandals, as ordinary Spaniards endure high unemployment and belt-tightening measures. Measures include a 65billion euro package of cuts and tax hikes announced by the government last week. Unpopular: King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain are being asked to make cutbacks by their country's government . King Juan Carlos will take around 20,900 euros less from his state payout this year, according to an updated version on Tuesday of the 2012 royal budget and sources at the royal household. His son and heir to the throne, Prince Felipe, will take about 10,500 euros less. That amounts to a 7.1 per cent pay cut, roughly equivalent to one of the most bitterly-disputed cuts included in the recent austerity package: the axing of Christmas bonuses for public workers, which amounts to about 7 per cent of their income. Other family members like Queen Sofia and Princess Leticia, Felipe's wife, will also receive less money from the budget, which is entirely made of taxpayers' money. The royal household estimates its move will help cut between 90,000 euros and 100,000 euros (between $109,900 and $122,100) off its budget for the year, which was already down on 2011 levels. The government's steep spending cuts are aimed at averting an international bailout amid a deep economic downturn. Riot police and protestors face-off during a demonstration by Spanish coal miners against austerity cuts . They have sparked daily protests by public-sectors workers throughout Madrid in the past week, with staff staging walkouts from various ministries and at the prime minister's office. The king, who has long been revered in Spain for his role in the nation's transition to democracy, angered many by going on a lavish elephant hunting trip in Botswana at a time when one in four Spaniards is out of work. The salary cut got a mixed reception from the public, with some readers of newspaper websites and Twitter users joking on whether the royal family would now struggle to make ends meet, or whether they would still be able to afford safari trips. Others, however, commended the royal household for at least volunteering to take the cut. The king's son-in-law Inaki Urdangarin is also embroiled in a court case over allegations he abused his position to embezzle money through a sports charity. He denies the allegations.","Popularity of royals has waned after series of scandals .

With a police helicopter hovering overhead and a specialist dog team on the prowl, locals were convinced they were witnessing a major manhunt. But a few minutes later the operation was stood down after officers caught their quarry – not a dangerous escaped prisoner or a terror suspect, but two naughty boys who had pinched some plastic goalposts. And the result? The two 16-year-olds were simply given a ticking off because of their ages and lack of previous offences. Over reaction: Essex Police scrambled its helicopter (file picture) and a dog search unit after the theft of equipment from a school playing field . Essex Police was yesterday criticised for scoring an own goal as locals accused them of a massive overreaction when they could have used the resources to catch serious criminals. Andy Wright, head of Rayne Primary School near Braintree, from where the goalposts were taken, said he was stunned the £700-an-hour helicopter had been deployed. 'I was very surprised when the caretaker told me that the police helicopter had been sent out,' he said. 'Of course, we do not want any of our equipment to be stolen as it belongs to the children. But  I really have no idea how this incident came to be escalated. 'I think the boys came on to the school grounds during the evening and just picked up a set of plastic goalposts that were on the grass.' A parent, whose daughter goes to the school, said: 'I saw the helicopter and thought there must have been something major happening nearby. So when I found out what  it was for I couldn't believe it. It's a massive overreaction, and parents I have spoken to feel the same way.' The operation began last Thursday evening when an off-duty police officer spotted two teenagers acting suspiciously in the grounds of the village school. Shock: Rayne . Primary School’s (pictured) headteacher, Andy Wright, was stunned when he was told . of the deployment of the helicopter to such a minor incident last . week . Minutes later the force's 145mph helicopter, which has a thermal- imaging camera, was clattering through the skies of Rayne while the dog team was scouring the ground. The boys were caught in nearby woodland after a few minutes and were spoken to before being released. They were not interviewed at a police station. The goalposts, which are worth less than £100, were recovered and returned to the school. Former Essex Police chief superintendent Mick Thwaites, who is running for the role of the county's police commissioner, said: 'It was potentially an own goal to send up the helicopter for this incident. 'The helicopter is a fantastic resource but it should be up there for major incidents such as firearms crime, police pursuits – a whole raft of things where air support is absolutely fantastic.' Stolen: The stolen goalposts were worth just £100 (file picture) and two 16-year-old boys were tracked down . Essex Police said the helicopter had 'not been up for very long'. A spokesman said: 'Due to the realistic prospect of catching the people responsible for the theft, resources – including the dog unit and helicopter – were sent to the scene to assist with the search. They were not being deployed to any emergency at the time. 'The resources were required because the two suspects had made their way into a wooded area. 'Essex Police is pleased that the two youngsters responsible were apprehended, given reprimands and strong words of advice.' The force is closing stations across the county as it cuts its budget by 20 per cent. The force saw a small rise in crime last year to 105,077 reported incidents, while the number solved fell nearly 3 per cent to 26.7 per cent. In 2010 police in neighbouring Hertfordshire were criticised when they sent out a helicopter to catch a shoplifter who stole meat from Tesco.","Parents have accused Essex Police of a 'massive over reaction'

When you look at the perks they receive - Britain's politicians could already be accused of taking the biscuit. But the Secretary of State for Justice, Ken Clarke, has nevertheless called for the return of a free supply of the tea-dipping snacks to cabinet meetings. Mr Clarke let his complaint slip-out during an appearance on the Channel 4 TV show 'Gordon Behind Bars'. The veteran Conservative politician . was visiting Brixton Prison as celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay requests . funding for the 'Bad Boys Bakery' where inmates cook products to sell on . the outside. As . he was talking to prisoners, Mr Clarke said: ‘I was complaining at . cabinet this morning that we don’t have biscuits anymore, so I’m looking . forward to a decent lunch.' He certainly had his fill at the prison as he tucked into lemon slices and steak during the visit. Asked about Mr Clarke's comment a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice confirmed that the cabinet minister would like to see biscuits back on the table at cabinet meetings 'because he likes them.' Mr Clarke revealed his concern about the lack of biscuits at cabinet meetings during a visit to Brixton Prison . Free biscuits are no longer a feature at the Coalition Government's cabinet meetings . His call appeared to be at odds with the mood of Prime Minister David Cameron who has predicted that austerity in Britain will continue until 2020. A 10 Downing Street spokesman refused to discuss the issue saying 'we don’t comment on such details.' The Biscuit Appreciation Society (BAS) is backing Mr Clarke in his bid to get digestives and shortbreads back on the trolley at Number 10. A BAS spokesman said: 'We are totally behind Ken Clarke on this - they should indeed bring back the biscuits at Cabinet meetings. 'For a start, biscuits are cheap. Secondly, people always get grumpy when they’re removed, usually as part of ridiculous cost-cutting measures. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice confirmed Mr Clarke wanted free biscuits to be returned to cabinet meetings 'because he likes them' 'If Cabinet members eat them and feel happy then they or more likely to make effective decisions that will have a beneficial effect on the nation and the economy.' The spokesman said it was 'short-sighted to scrimp on biscuits' and claimed that research had shown the snacks have 'a positive impact' on meetings. Nutritional expert Charlotte Watts said that, although biscuits give an immediate energy boost during a long working day, the effects are temporary. 'Biscuits are provided in business meetings as a ‘treat’ and as an immediate sugar high. 'They are so popular in meetings because people think they will get that immediate energy rush from them, but there is no actual health benefits in the long term.’","Clarke bemoans removal of free biscuits from cabinet meetings .

It has been a busy two days for George Zimmerman as he sat down for his first on-screen interview since his arrest over the death of Trayvon Martin. He revived his old website and posted a personal plea to supporters, thanking them for their continued prayers and financial help. Each of those public moves have had a judicial impact as both his hour-long interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity and his bilingual YouTube video have been added to the collection of possible evidence to be used in his trial. Scroll down for videos . Direct appeal: George Zimmerman posted a nearly-2 minute, bilingual video thanking fans for their support . Different view: Zimmerman writes, in addition to hoping to collect money for his defense fund, his new website can be a way for his supporters can connect and get the true information . ABC News reports that the prosecution, . which charged the neighborhood watchman with the second degree murder . of the unarmed teen, entered a tape of the interview into evidence . Thursday morning. One of the most controversial points . of the interview was when the 28-year-old said that 'It was God's plan' when asked if he would do anything differently. He went on to clarify his statement, . saying: 'I do wish there was something, anything I would have done to . put me in a position where I didn’t have to take his life.’ Prosecutors will likely use this to . argue that the attack was premeditated and his lack of remorse shows . that he may have had ulterior motives during the attack. Legal analysts feel that Zimmerman has put himself in a trap in allowing for the interview to take place. ‘He has impeached himself publicly, . this is going to be a huge problem for him... and the prosecutors must be . extremely pleased... He was making inconsistent statements that they can . use in a trial against him,’ said veteran legal consultant Mark Eiglarsh . to ABC News. Opening up: This is the first time George Zimmerman has spoken publicly about the night he killed Trayvon Martin . No regret: George Zimmerman, left, tells Fox News' Sean Hannity in an exclusive interview that aired Wednesday night that he did not regret being armed or carrying a gun . Latest twist: Zimmerman tried to speak to Walters today while she was talking about him on The View but she refused again . Whether he likes it or not, Zimmerman . is also being tried in the court of public opinion and that case does . not appear to be going very well either. Legendary anchor Barbara Walters . appeared on her show, The View, on Thursday morning telling of her own . chaotic interaction with Zimmerman the night before. Zimmerman told the ABC team yesterday . he would only agree to talk to her after the exclusive with Sean Hannity . and only if she put him and his wife up in a hotel for a month. Walters, already reportedly seething . she didn't get the exclusive, was said to have been 'appalled' by the . conditions and called him 'desperate for money'. Speaking about the almost-interview on . The View, she explained that Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara agreed to . let her do the interview but only after he sat down with Hannity, who . 'had been very supportive in the past and George Zimmerman told me that . he was very grateful, and I appreciated his loyalty to Hannity', she . said. When she arrived in Florida yesterday . morning for the planned interview, she told viewers when Zimmerman came . to the door in a T-shirt, it should have been her 'first clue' that he . wasn't going to do it. Defence: Zimmerman is represented by attorney Mark O'Mara, centre, seen walking to the Seminole County Court . Though she would not disclose what the . 'one condition' was that the 28-year-old demanded, she alluded to the . fact it was payment of some sort by saying 'as a member of ABC News it . was not something she was able to grant'. ABC News does not pay for interviews. She then went on to describe Zimmerman . as 'desperate for money' and 'very worried about his family', adding . that he was 'polite, soft-spoken, stubborn' as his lawyer 'wanted him to . do the interview'. As she was explaining the situation to . her co-hosts and the world live on TV, she heard through her earpiece . that Zimmerman and his lawyer Mark O’Mara were on the phone asking to . speak with her. On air, she rejected the call, saying: . 'Well this is an interesting day. But Mr Zimmerman, if you could not do . the interview yesterday, I don’t think we should do a quick one today. In the future if you feel differently, we will consider it. 'We will now continue with our program and the people who want to be interviewed.' Zimmerman’s lawyer Mark O’Mara spoke . to The Miami Herald, giving a glimpse in the seemingly-chaotic world of . dealing with George. ‘The client always calls the shots,’ Mr O’Mara said. ‘If you’re on the streets or about to . be hungry and worried for the wife you love, maybe you have to make . decisions along the way.’ Speaking about the on-air phone call to Walters, Mr O’Mara defended his client. ‘He just wanted to thank her for being . gracious and to apologize. We weren’t expecting to do an interview live . on her show,’ he said. ‘It was a team decision, made on the . fly, quite quickly. Someone said she was talking about it on the show, . so we jumped up and turned on the TV. There wasn’t a lot of . forethought.’ First appearance: George Zimmerman was pictured for the first time after his second degree murder charge on April 12 . Fellow Florida defense attorney . Michael Grieco says that the actions over the past few days give an . insight into how the case is being handled behind the scenes, and it . isn’t pretty. ‘O’Mara is not in control over the situation and has got to pull the reins in,’ Mr Grieco told The Herald. ‘Zimmerman is a loose cannon... he can’t see past his nose.’ Enter Zimmerman and his computer: on . Thursday morning, Zimmerman relaunched his website and posted a note to . supporters as well as a bilingual YouTube video saying that he wanted to . thank them but also expressing his financial need. ‘Given the extraordinary circumstances . surrounding this case, we have now realized that it is much larger than . we ever thought regarding its extent and cost,’ he wrote on the site. ‘We have been in hiding in temporary . housing, and our security needs have been extremely high. The fund has . been devastated by the need to pay $100,000 to a bondsman and almost . $50,000 in security expenses. ‘The skyrocketing legal costs have . gone unpaid. The defense fund is at its lowest point since its . inception; in fact, with outstanding expenses yet unpaid, the fund is . near depletion.’ Evidence: Zimmerman told Hannity that Trayvon broke his nose and slammed his head into the pavement, which corroborate with the Sanford police department's photos from that night . First encounter: George Zimmerman, right, seen in chains, first apologised to Trayvon Martin's parents at a bond hearing on April 20th . The . couple have already come under fire after lying about their finances . which - when disclosed - led to Zimmerman being arrested again and his . bail being put up to $1million. The interview came one day after it was . revealed that Zimmerman and his wife blew through $36,000 of cash he . raised from his online legal defense fund on personal expenses like car . payments, cell phones and paying off credit card debt -- even though he . was in jail at the time. Among . the expenses were $600 in jailhouse phone calls. Zimmerman, 28, spent . three to five hours a day on the phone while he was in jail -- placing . an average of 13 calls to friends and family each day, the Orlando Sentinel reports. In . many of those calls Zimmerman used code to talk about money, especially . from the PayPal account. The biggest single chunk of money was a $5,000 . payment for Zimmerman's first bail, which was set at $150,000. However, the couple spent $7,000 to pay . down credit card bills - $4,000 on their America Express bill alone. O'Mara says the bills were for expenses that Zimmerman incurred when they . had to flee their home after they began receiving death threats. Grieving parents: Sybrina Fulton, left, and Tracy Martin, second right, the parents of Trayvon Martin, as seen on April 20th . Killed: Trayvon Martin was shot and killed the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida by George Zimmerman . Since being released, the interview with Hannity was the first time the 28-year-old has . publicly spoken about the fateful night, explaining that it was no . longer a choice for him to reach for the gun once he said Trayvon Martin . started bashing his head into the sidewalk and noticed his gun. He said: ‘At that point, I realized . that it wasn’t my gun, it wasn’t his gun, it was the gun. He said you’re . going to die tonight, [expletive]. I felt one of his hands going down . my chest to my bolster. It just happened so quickly.’ Hannity later asked him if he . regretted getting out of his car initially. Zimmerman said no, then . saying he didn’t regret being armed, nor his other actions that night, . adding: ‘I feel that it was all God’s plan. For me to second guess it, . um...’ Throughout the interview, O’Mara sat beside his client, listening and at one point . taking a moment to say that with all the evidence presented, . Zimmerman’s second-degree murder charge should be dropped to . manslaughter.

Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 12:00 EST, 20 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:00 EST, 20 July 2012 . Professional boxer Clifton Mitchell has been sentenced to seven years in prison for the manslaughter of Leeds University student Jagdip Randhawa . A professional boxer who killed a talented young student with a single punch to the face on a drunken night out has been jailed for seven years. Super middleweight Clifton Ty Mitchell, 21, hit Jagdip Randhawa, 19, with a jab to the chin during a row outside a Subway fast food restaurant in Leeds. The blow knocked the victim unconscious and caused him to fall and hit his head on the concrete pavement. Mr Randhawa - described as a 'brilliant student' and 'excellent sportsman' - was taken to Leeds General Infirmary with a fractured skull and bleeding from the brain. He never regained consciousness and died five days later on October 17 last year. Sentencing Mitchell for manslaughter at Leeds Crown Court Mr Justice Maddison order that his jail term be extended by three years because he is a dangerous offender. 'You have been a professional boxer and it is a great shame that you will not be able to maintain what was clearly a promising career,' the judge said. 'But, being a professional boxer, you have the strength and skill to cause serious harm with your bare fists.' Mitchell, of Broadway Park Close, Derby, had a string of previous convictions for similar offences, including punching a woman in a nightclub, and knocking out a man in Derby city centre. 'Gifted': Student Jagdip Randhawa, 19, never regained consciousness after being punched in the face by boxer Clifton Ty Mitchell following a night out in Leeds . Mr Randhawa, who had been head boy at his school, was in his second year at Leeds University, where he was studying English and linguistics. The 19-year-old was described in court as a 'gifted writer', who had ambitions of being a journalist after finishing his degree. Mr Randhawa, from Hounslow, Middlesex, had been published at 17-years-old, the court heard. Mr Randhawa's family wept in court as Mr Justice Maddison told Mitchell: 'You not only took his life but ruined the lives of those who loved him'. The student's sister Majinda said her family had been left 'scarred for life'. 'Me and my mother are stricken by grief,' she said in a victim impact statement. 'His mother goes into his bedroom every day and cries.' The jury was told that Mr Randhawa might have survived had be not been hooked up to faulty ventilation equipment at Leeds General Infirmary, which starved his brain of blood and oxygen. Tragic: Jagdip Randhawa's sister has said her family has been left 'scarred for life' by the loss of the 19-year-old . Mitchell was visiting friends in Leeds on the night of the incident, and they had been drinking vodka and Red Bull in the city's Tiger Tiger nightclub before heading to the nearby Subway takeaway, where they encountered Mr Randhawa and his friends in the early hours of October 12 last year. Prosecutor Peter Moulson QC said Mr Randhawa had been goaded into a fight by one of the defendant's friends Krishan Chauhan, 23, and who Mr Randhawa got the better of. Mitchell was also spoiling for a fight with Mr Randhawa and the boxer punched him to the ground. The defendant and his friends then walked away, the court heard. A security guard who witnessed the scene described the super middleweight's punch being delivered with 'lightning' speed. Pro boxer Clifton Ty Mitchell had been drinking with friends in Tiger Tiger in Leeds city centre (file photo) Mr Randhawa was 'wobbly' but able to walk, and the two groups went their seperate ways, but encountered each other again soon afterwards. Enraged Mitchell targeted his victim again shouting 'let's do it, let's do it', the court heard, before punching the 19-year-old in the face. 'This second and we say fatal punch was again delivered by the defendant, the professional boxer to Mr Randhawa's face,' Mr Moulson said. Southpaw Mitchell used his right hand because his left had been injured in a boxing bout four days earlier, the court was told. Witnesses described Mr Randhawa being hit ‘square on the chin’ and said his legs ‘went like jelly’. His friend Gareth Donovan was also hit by Mitchell. Mr Randhawa was taken by ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary, where he was linked up to a faulty ventilator for 46 minutes, the court was told. This starved his brain of blood and oxygen, and contributed to his death five days later on October 17. The jury found Mitchell not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. He was also found guilty of assault on Gareth Donovan.

"Fearne Cotton, Holly Valance, Tess Daly and The Saturdays all own a pair of Zaggora's Hotpants . Shorts increase core body temperature so wearer expend more energy . By . Deborah Arthurs . PUBLISHED: . 05:44 EST, 17 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:30 EST, 18 May 2012 . They sound too good to be true. A pair of pants that allow you to burn calories simply by wearing them. But that is just what Zaggora's HotPants claim to do. Launched last year amid great fanfare, the £50 garment can help the wearer burn four times the number of calories they would expend during a regular work out, the firm says. And what's more, when the wearer stops their physical activity, the shorts continue to burn calories at a rate of 16 per cent more than the body would burn without the shorts. Scroll down for video . HotPant fans? Holly Willoughby, left, and Fearne Cotton are both said to own pairs of the shorts, while Tess Daly has raved about them in her newspaper column . If true, it is nothing short of a miracle (and begs the question, why are we not wearing these shorts right now?). We might not be - but there's a good chance Holly Willoughby is - she was given a pair late last year.  Or Fearne Cotton, Holly Valance, Tess Daly and any one of The Saturdays, all of whom have their own pairs of the fat-burning magic pants. Tess Daly was so impressed by the shorts that she was moved to wax lyrical about them in her newspaper column . The company, who have released two collections of their HotPants to date, which include both bottom and calf-targeting garments, has just released their summer collection - a brightly coloured, lighter range that uses less fabric to get the same results. That means a lighter feel on the body, but the same number of calories burned, according to Zaggora. Just as with the original HotPants and the rest of the Zaggora range, the new Viva HotPants target the thighs, stomach and bottom, and claim they can help wearers lose two jean sizes in two weeks. Working up a sweat: Zaggora's Viva HotPants raise the core body temperature to increase the number of calories expended with physical exercise . Fat-burners: The colourful new summer range is made of a lighter fabric than previous collections but are just as effective, the firm says . The shorts work by increasing perspiration - and the manufacturers say the results have been 'lab-proven' by scientists, after researchers from the Chelsea School of Sport at Brighton University found weight loss to be four times greater in subjects who exercised wearing the HotPants. The core temperature in HotPants increased by an average of 18 per cent compared to the control, they found - with the effects ongoing after activity has ceased. The firm's Facebook page is full of thousands of enthusiastic women extolling the virtues of the HotPants. Tara Cash writes on the firm's wall that she has lost eight pounds thanks to the shorts. 'For the past seven weeks I've been wearing my Zaggora HotPants under my shorts when I run during my lunch hour Monday to Friday, and under my pants when I Zumba three times a week. And I am happy to report I've lost 8 pounds and am finally back to my normal weight whereas I had been struggling for 7 months prior.' Another wrote: 'Three weeks wearing my HotPants and I've lost three inches from my waist and one and a half from my thighs.' The shorts are available from zaggora.com. VIDEO: Want curves like Holly?

But it appears that Bowie shares similarly mismatched colour eyes to Speedy - a white domestic cat from Norfolk, Virginia, U.S. Speedy, who has one green and one gold eye, was born with a feline form of complete heterochromia, a condition that also occurs in some other animals. The condition most commonly affects white-coloured cats but may be found in a cat of any colour, provided that it possesses the white spotting gene. Mismatched: Speedy was born with bi-coloured eyes - one is blue and the other is gold. She has a feline form of complete heterochromia, a condition that also occurs in some other animals . It appears that Bowie shares similarly mismatched colour eyes to Speedy - a white domestic cat from Norfolk, Virginia, U.S. But Bowie's different colour eyes are the result of being punched at secondary school, by a school friend. The impact tore the sphincter muscles in Bowie's left eye and although he had several operations, his pupil remains permanently open. This causes the eye to look like it is a darker colour, but it is actually the same shade. Lorraine Hudgins took the photographs of odd-eyed Speedy as she kept her company at her desk.

Tyrone admits that opposition forwards regularly underestimate him. But they are often left frustrated by his shot-stopping prowess - and has saved three of his last five penalties. One-armed wonder: Tyrone Welcome regularly surprises his opposition with his shot-stopping prowess despite his disability . At full stretch: Tyrone has saved three penalties out of his last five for his team, Aston Stars FC . Tyrone, 38, said: 'Once the other team have seen me make a few stops they soon realise I’m hard to beat. 'Because I’ve had to focus so hard on my game, my mind is always one step ahead - I think my anticipation is twice what it would have been otherwise. 'It’s a bit of reverse psychology. I know they’ll naturally try and stick it down my right hand side, so I edge even closer to the left to encourage them to hit it that way. 'Once they’ve fallen for it I throw my weight the other way and save it. It works like a dream.' Reverse psychology: Tyrone play mind games with the opposition to ensure he can anticipate which way they will shoot . Penalty hero: Tyrone celebrates with his teammates, who play in the Birmingham Southern League . When it comes to catching the ball, Tyrone says he normally opts to punch it safety. 'With practice you get very good at anticipating the flight of the ball and getting some real distance on it,' he added. 'I take real pride in a clean sheet and every time I play I aim to keep one. I have a mixed record, but over the years I’ve got my fair share.'

He said: 'I’ve wanted to test myself in proper match situations for a while now so when Aston Stars came calling it was the perfect opportunity for me. 'I initially got the call-up to the national team nine years ago from a GB amputee player. I wasn’t going to go as I regard myself as able-bodied, but I went and I loved every minute. 'To pull on the jersey and belt out the national anthem in front of thousands of people is beyond a dream - I get a tear in my eye when I’m out there.' The FA currently offers no financial support meaning the only way Tyrone and his national teammates can compete in tournaments is through self-funding.

The woman accused of killing the young wife of a US Marine pleaded not guilty to murder charges Thursday. Prosecutors offered no details of the motive Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, had to allegedly harm Brittany, Dawn Killgore, 22, whose body was discovered in brush near a lake in San Diego, California. However, Lopez's neighbor claims she and Mrs Killgore were involved in a dangerous sex ring, playing sex slaves. A second Marine, Louis Ray Perez, who has been named a person of interest, has not been charged with the murder. He is currently in jail, facing charges he stole an assault rifle. Scroll down for video . Tragic: The body of Brittany Killgore was discovered on Tuesday, four days after she was last seen with a marine who was later arrested on an unrelated charge . Suspect: Authorities believe that the victim knew Jessica Lynn Lopez (pictured here), and the two were involved in some kind of sex slave ring . Lopez, who pleaded not guilty Thursday, was discovered with the note in a San Diego hotel room, prosecutor Patrick Espinoza said. No further details were released about the note. Authorities said earlier this week that paramedics hospitalized Lopez after finding her with self-inflicted cuts in the room but didn't disclose the suicide note. Within hours of finding Lopez, searchers discovered the body of Killgore. Bail for Lopez was set at $3 million at her arraignment in Vista Superior Court, north of San Diego. Lopez's attorney Dean Broyles said he didn't know if his client knew Perez or Mrs Killgore, who was reported missing Saturday -- one day after Lopez turned 25. 'There's a lot of speculation, a lot of innuendo, a lot of weak allegations and charges out there,' he said. 'I would caution everyone to not jump to conclusions and prejudge based on all the information flying around right now.' Mr Broyles said Lopez would ask the judge for a public defender after her family sought his help in fielding media questions. Lopez's parents, who live in nearby Escondido, released a statement saying they loved their daughter. 'We pray for the family of Brittany Killgore and ask that the Lord comfort them during their time of grief and anguish,' the parents said.

Missing: Brittany Killgore lived in Fallbrook, California, not far from Camp Pendleton . Lopez's bail was set at $3 million. Mrs Killgore went missing shortly after . filing for divorce from her husband, Cory Killgore a 22-year-old Marine deployed to . Afghanistan. Her body was found in brush near Lake Skinner in Riverside . County about 25 miles northeast of her modest, two-story apartment in . Fallbrook, a San Diego County community known for its avocado orchards. Killgore lived a short walk from an . entrance to Camp Pendleton, and her complex - like others around it - is . full of Marines and their families who tend to be short-term residents . and often don't get to know each other well. Fears: Cory, right, is returning from Afghanistan after hearing about the disappearance of his wife, left . Killgore's husband, Lance Corporal . Cory Killgore, flew back to California after learning his wife was . missing. Sheriff's authorities say he is not a suspect. The couple from Missouri were married . in July 2010. Brittany Killgore filed for divorce April 10 and listed . 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason. She gave no details on the . paperwork. Her cellphone was found in the Gaslamp District of downtown San Diego, an area populated with bars and restaurants. Darryl J Wrest of Rolla, Missouri, . confirmed Brittany Killgore is his daughter but said he was not . commenting on anything at this time. Killgore's other family members . also declined to comment. Authorities investigating the homicide said a suicide note . of the prime suspect contained key details about the case, including . the location of a body. Serious: The Fallbrook scene where Louis Ray Perez is being questioned in connection with the disappearance . Authorities in California are now reportedly examining a possible link between Killgore, the suspect, and a seedy sex ring. ABC 10 reported that officers later responded to a Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport, . where they found a woman with stab wounds all over her body in an . apparent suicide attempt. That woman, 27-year-old Lopez, was arrested at the scene but hospitalised at UCSD Medical Center. She was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday, and charged with murder in Killgore's death.

"By . Emily Andrews . UPDATED: . 23:12 EST, 27 January 2012 . The opening ceremony of the Olympic Games will feature a performance by hundreds of nurses, it was revealed yesterday. Artistic director Danny Boyle – the Oscar-winning director behind Slumdog Millionaire – said he wanted to celebrate everything that was ‘unique and special’ to the British Isles…including the National Health Service. Europe’s biggest bell will be specially made to ring in the start of London 2012. Our turn next: Mark Foster of the Great Britain Olympic men's swim team carries his country's flag to lead out the delegation during the Opening Ceremony for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics . The 27-ton bell will be a feat of engineering and twice the weight of Big Ben. Mr Boyle said the ceremony will be called ‘Isles of Wonders’ after a speech in Shakespeare’s play The Tempest. More than anything, he said, he wanted it to be a ‘people’s Games’ and . to try to capture the very particular, and sometimes peculiar, British . sense of humour. A sense of humour that has, at times, been tested by the spiralling . budget for the Olympic ceremonies – last month it doubled to £81million. At the vast rehearsal studios in East London Mr Boyle gave a small . glimpse of what 80,000 spectators and millions of TV viewers can expect . on July 27. The biggest ringing bell in Europe has been commissioned and will hang at one end of the stadium. It will ‘ring in’ the start of the Games and will be inscribed with . Caliban’s line from The Tempest ‘Be not afeard; the isle is full of . noises’. Shakespeare, NHS and schoolchildren will be at the centre of the Olympic Opening Ceremony display, Danny Boyle, pictured, revealed today . The half-man, half-monster Caliban is devoted to the island on which he . lives – and Mr Boyle hopes to mirror that pride and patriotism in the . ceremony. Indeed he seemed to be rather keen on monsters – he said that last . year’s production of Frankenstein at the National Theatre had allowed . him to practise lots of ideas. So perhaps we’ll see lots of prosthetics, . green paint and pantomime costumes alongside runners from Kenya and . gymnasts from Russia. Another theme will be the cleansing and recovery of poisoned land – . after the Olympic park site was cleaned of all its industrial . pollutants. Greatest show on earth: The spectacular Opening Ceremony in Beijing in the Bird's Nest Stadium four years ago . One certainty is that there’ll be lots of flying – and flowers. A flying . system that can lift 25 tons, the equivalent of five elephants, has . been installed in the main stadium to enable some impressive aerial . acrobatics. Most employers have not drawn up plans for dealing with an expected surge in staff absence during the Olympics, months before the Games start, according to a report today. A survey of 1,000 office workers by recruitment consultants Badenoch & Clark showed that two-thirds were employed in companies yet to draft a plan. Among those who have agreed procedures in place, some said annual leave will be given on a first-come, first-served basis, while a small percentage have told staff they will not be allowed to take a break while the Games are held. Employers in London are among those most likely not to have told their staff about holiday plans when the sporting event is held in the capital. Nicola Linkleter, managing director at Badenoch & Clark, said: 'Given the immense interest the London Olympic Games will create among workers, this is poor planning that could lead to employee discontent, confusion or threadbare cover.' And Sebastian Coe, chairman of London 2012, dropped another hint by . saying whenever he popped down to see rehearsals he kept tripping over . buckets of flowers. So it will be noisy, acrobatic, colourful and floral. What else? Well, the only other confirmed part was that nurses will have a starring . role in one ‘sequence’ as the NHS is one of the things that is ‘unique . about us…along with our sense of humour’. Featuring with them will be some 900 children from the six Olympic host boroughs who have been auditioning in recent weeks. No details of performers were revealed – but again a hint that . ‘everyone’ wants to take part. But we can expect the spectacular. And . the unexpected. Asked if the fear of technology going wrong had ensured they play safe, . executive producer Stephen Daldry implied they would be pushing . boundaries. He said: ‘The idea of jeopardy is one of the great fantastic . tensions of the evening.’ Mr Boyle said only about a third of the budget would be spent on the . opening ceremony, which was much less than the £65million the Chinese . spent at Beijing 2008. He said: ‘You are standing on the shoulders of giants when you do this . kind of job. You cannot but live in the shadow of your predecessors. Countdown: Sebastian Coe, Boris Johnson and David Cameron discuss the six-month countdown to the Olympic games in Davos yesterday . ‘The spectacle of Beijing was just breathtaking. The sheer beauty of . Athens is very inspiring but I have to say that Sydney has inspired us. It got the feel of a people’s Games right. ‘It is inevitable that people will compare us – and that is fine. ‘I think there is a sea change and we are lucky enough to be setting it. It will be spectacular but the reduction in scale is inevitable.’ London 2012 said it will release more details of the opening in the . run-up to the Games to give people a flavour of what to expect. Mr Boyle said he would have preferred to keep everything a ‘surprise’ but that was impossible when everyone ‘films everything on their . mobiles’. Estimates suggest the advertising spend during the ceremony, which will last three hours, could be worth £2billion globally. Staging . the four showpiece opening and closing ceremonies for the London 2012 . Games is 'challenging, daunting but also incredibly exciting', executive . producer Stephen Daldry said today. He described it as like putting on 165 West End shows at the same time. Nurses, the biggest ringing bell in . Europe inscribed with lines from Shakespeare, and children will be key . features of the opening ceremony. Here are some of the facts, figures and details behind the ceremonies.

Mystery still surrounds the 2008 'kidnapping' of a pilot who was subjected to an unclaimed $750,000 ransom bid and whose body has never been found. More than four years on, the whereabouts of 26-year-old Robert Wiles is still unknown, despite a workmate recently being found guilty of his manslaughter. His parents, Tom and Pamela, this week revealed for the first time the inside story about their heartbreaking ordeal in a special 48 Hours Mystery broadcast on CBS. Scroll down to see video... Missing: Robert Wiles vanished in 2008 and has never been found . Ransom demand: This is the email sent to Tom Wiles demanding $750,000 for the release of his son Robert . They told how they received an anonymous note, signed 'Group X', demanding three quarters of a million dollars on April 3 - two days after Robert vanished. Convicted: Toby Holt, who was sentenced for the manslaughter of Robert Wiles . They stumped up the cash and tried to drop it off to the supposed abductor, but no-one came to claim it. Robert, business development manager and pilot at the Lakeland, Florida, branch of Tom's aircraft maintenance firm National Flight Services, was never heard from again. No further demands were made on the ransom, and his body was never found. Speaking of the moment they received the note, Tom said: 'I can't imagine anything worse. Somebody has taken one of your children, and is threatening to kill him. 'When I opened the email, it scared the hell out of me. I found the ransom demand from the people who had taken Robert.' The note said: 'We have Robert, if you . hope to see him alive again, you must follow our instructions without . deviation! Do not speak about this to anyone, including family.' There . was a five-day deadline of April 8, and so, after drafting in the FBI, . Tom, who lived in Toledo, Ohio, set off to Florida. Hope: Robert Wiles' family offered a $250,000 for any information leading to the discovery of the missing man . He . wired the money to a Florida bank with the idea that he would use it as . bait to entice the abductor. But officers rejected that plan and filled . it with coffee that weighed the same amount as the cash. They . placed the box, as demanded, in Robert's office. A secret camera was . set up to record what happened, and armed SWAT teams hid close by. But . no-one ever came to collect the loot. It was during this time the FBI turned its attention to Tom, who had separated from Pamela some years earlier and had just reached a deal where she would receive $750,000. FBI special agent Jim Bucenell told 48 Hours Mystery this information led him to believe that the author of the ransom note was 'very close to this business'. Desperate: Robters' parents, Tom (left) and Pamela (right) this week revealed for the first time the inside story about their heartbreaking ordeal in a special 48 Hours Mystery broadcast on CBS . Tom said he felt, during that time, like a suspect. He said: 'They treated me like one. I was grilled a number of times. I was very angry. You know, 'How could you possibly be looking at me?' Pamela was also under the spotlight, as was former colleague mechanic Steve Lindsey who had been sacked because of a drink problem. No-one could understand how Robert, a star athlete in great physical condition who was a keen boater and fisherman and had spent years in military academies, could have vanished so suddenly. Tom and Pamela, becoming increasingly desperate, offered a $250,000 reward on national television and followed up on tips from psychics who claimed to know the location of their son. Then came the bombshell, from his barber Janie Bear, that Wiles could still be alive. She said he once told her 'he was frustrated with his life'. Puzzle: No-one could understand how Robert, a star athlete in great physical condition who was a keen boater and fisherman and had spent years in military academies, could have vanished so suddenly . She said Robert had learned his father carried a kidnapping insurance policy and ended their conversation by saying: 'Please don't tell anybody I told you all this'. But family members say Robert would never be that selfish and the investigation took another turn as officers spoke to Joel Valle, the the owner of another airplane engine repair business. The pair had been together the day before his disappearance and had come up with a plan to partner their firms with Steve Lindsey to play a key role. Everything was in place but Tom, who had previously sacked Lindsey, vetoed the proposals. Lindsey went on the run. In desperation, FBI agents obtained detailed call records of the location of Robert's mobile phone calls and, in turn, CCTV footage of the various toll booths on the Polk Parkway where a call was made from. Tom was drafted in to look at the tapes and quickly spotted the car of Toby Holt, his 42-year-old operations manager, who passed through the toll booth with his right arm and hand close to his ear. But, according to Holt's own phone records, his mobile was not in use as he went through the toll. He then became a prime suspect, was called in for questioning and could not provide an alibi for his whereabouts that evening. The FBI discovered he had several mistresses, outside his marriage to wife Beverly. But there was no DNA, blood or forensic proof to link him to the crime. The trail had gone cold. Then, in March 2009, the FBI called in reinforcements to 'systematically' go back over the case. They soon realised that 'Toby Holt's phone and Robert Wiles' phones were seemingly synchronised' meaning that, in the tollbooth photograph, Holt was using Wiles' phone. Bucenell said: 'When you put them together - the pieces of the puzzle - it's - it's a very strong circumstantial case.' Holt was arrested on December 18, 2009, at Orlando International Airport after a flight from Bogota, Colombia. Toby Holt, whose real first name is Stobert, denied the charges of extortion, kidnapping and murder of Robert Wiles and languished in a Florida jail for two years. Then, in January 2012, he stood trial. Defence lawyers said there was no evidence and pointed the finger at Steve Lindsey, who in fact died of lung cancer in 2009. But prosecutors said that 'too many coincidences is not a coincidence' and that Holt's unexplained whereabouts for over four hours the night Robert disappeared was key. They also said Holt repeatedly used Wiles' phone, even using it to send the ransom demand to his father. Holt was found guilty of manslaughter and is currently scheduled for release in 2039 when he will be 72-years-old. He is appealing his conviction based on insufficient evidence. Tom Wiles told the court following the verdict: 'Keep this man off the street, and maybe someway, somehow, somewhere he'll decide to tell us where, what he did - what he did with Robert. 'We have a son. We don't know where he is. We wanna bring him home. I wanna know where my son is.' Pamela added: 'I'd give anything for - to hear him again. Just to touch him again.'","Robert Wiles vanished from Florida aircraft maintenance firm in April 2008 .

'Children's end': Nick Clegg told told the Leveson Inquiry he was 'ignored and derided' before the Lib Dems entered Government . Nick Clegg was left to sit at the 'children's end of the table' when he first met Rupert Murdoch, he told the Leveson Inquiry today. The Deputy Prime Minister said he was 'ignored and derided' before the Liberal Democrats entered Government. Giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into media standards, Mr Clegg revealed he questioned David Cameron on his decision to appoint Andy Coulson as his press secretary in the days after the coalition was formed. But the Prime Minister told him that 'everyone deserves a second chance'. The Lib Dem leader said prior to the election he was shunned by the Press and was only an observer at the dinner party in December 2009 which Rebekah Brooks also attended. But after he performed strongly in the first televised debate in the run-up to the last general election, he said that newspapers led a 'vitriolic' campaign against him. Mr Clegg accused the media of going after 'the man rather than the ball' to tackle the new 'yellow team' who had come to the field. In contrast, the Liberal Democrat leader said when he became leader of the party in 2008 many senior figures did not 'know me from Adam'. Talking about the dinner on December . 16, 2009 that he attended with Mr Murdoch, Mrs Brooks and Sunday Times . editor John Witherow and a number of other people, Mr Clegg said he was little more than 'an . observer'. 'I was at the very end of the table, where the children sit, so to speak,' he added. It is unclear who else was at the dinner. The following March he had lunch with . Sun editor Dominic Mohan, and a 'brief' meeting with Mrs Brooks and Mr . Murdoch lasting a maximum of 10 minutes. He had also met the media mogul's son James Murdoch twice before in April 2008 and July 2009. The Lib Dem leader's appearance before Lord Justice Leveson meant he avoided frontbench alongside David Cameron at Prime . Minister's questions today after he ordered his MPs not to back Jeremy . Hunt in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister is due to give evidence to Lord Justice Leveson himself tomorrow. Labour will force a vote on whether . there should be a sleaze inquiry over his handling of the Murdoch . empire’s takeover bid for BSkyB. Mr Clegg said Jeremy Hunt has given a 'full, good and convincing account' of his handling of the BSkyB bid. The Deputy Prime Minister delivered . his strongest backing yet for the Culture Secretary - despite signalling . last night that Mr Hunt should be subject to a sleaze probe. Mr Clegg said he sought assurances from . then cabinet secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell that News Corporation's attempt . to take full control of BSkyB would be handled properly if . responsibility was shifted to Mr Hunt. 'I was ready to accept the reassurances, . as I did, that the process would have to be conducted in a sort of . objective and quasi-judicial manner and that in one sense Jeremy Hunt's . personal views were as irrelevant as Vince Cable's were,' Mr Clegg said. Evidence: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today said newspapers played the 'man and not the ball' with attacks on him after he performed well in the first television debate before the general election. However, he defended the right of papers to be partisan . Mr Cameron has refused to call in Sir . Alex Allan, the independent adviser on the ministerial code of conduct, . to investigate if Mr Hunt breached the rules. Mr Hunt has faced criticism over his office's ties with News Corporation lobbyist Fred Michel. Tennis partner: News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel's children goes to the same school as Nick Clegg . Nick Clegg lives near Mr Michel in Putney, south-west London and has also played tennis with the lobbyist. However, he today sought to distance himself from him and said they have barely met since the general election. Mr Clegg told Lord Justice Leveson: 'Fred Michel and I first met each . other many years ago well before I thought of entering British Politics . when he was working at the time for a centre-left think tank. 'Our children go to the same school in . south-west London so I very much knew him before he was employed in his . current capacity.' My Clegg added that he had not seen Mr Michel since November 2010. He said: 'Since the general election . in May 2010 my social contact with him is very very infrequent indeed . there was one dinner we were both invited to held by someone we both . know in Putney in September 2010.' Nick Clegg said he questioned David Cameron about his decision to appoint Andy Coulson as his press secretary in the days after the election. But the new Prime Minister said that the former News of the World editor 'deserves a second chance'. Mr Clegg said that Mr Cameron was free to make his own appointments. The Liberal Democrat leader told the inquiry: 'I said to the Prime Minister ""is this the right thing to do given the controversy around Andy Coulson and my party's view on him?"".' Nick Clegg today praised the Daily Mail for their 'outstanding' campaign to have Stephen Lawrence's killers brought to justice. The Deputy Prime Minister said it was important that newspapers led campaigns and that politicians responded to them. Gary . Dobson and Stephen Norris were jailed for life in January for the . racist murder of 18-year-old A-level student Stephen Lawrence in Eltham, . south London, in April 1993. The . Daily Mail campaigned for justice for Stephen's parents Doreen and . Neville Lawrence, culminating in the landmark convictions. Mr . Clegg said: 'The Daily Mail's outstanding campaign on bringing the . murderers of Stephen Lawrence to justice was a brave campaign and . undoubtedly justified.' He . also praised the Guardian for pursuing phone-hacking and said it was a . 'virtue' of the British press that they launched such campaigns. But Mr Clegg said Mr Cameron replied that he 'felt, as he put it, he deserved a second chance. A lot of the allegations we now know were not known to us then and this conversation would have been quite different. 'In a Coalition the Prime Minister has a right to make choices about who he appoints to his team which I can't, and wouldn't ever, seek to veto.' Mr Clegg gave details of an apparent warning over the BSkyB bid which was conveyed though his then parliamentary aide Norman Lamb. The MP had been told 'that it would be good for the Lib Dems to be open to the bid, otherwise we would expect no favourable treatment from the Murdoch press', according to the Deputy Prime Minister. 'Norman was quite agitated about that,' Mr Clegg went on. 'As we had not received particularly favourable treatment in the first place I did not think it was a particularly credible threat.' Mr Clegg said newspapers led an at times . 'vitriolic' campaign against him in the run-up to the last general . election after he performed strongly in the first television debate . between the three party leaders. He said the Press had gone from being 'indifferent at best' to 'lashing out' after his ratings spiked in the polls. 'If that is what you are used to in . the press it must come as a bit of a shock, I guess, when you suddenly . have these people who you have been either ignoring or deriding suddenly . doing well in a general election, you start lashing out a bit and that . is what happened,' Mr Clegg said. However, he defended the right of newspapers to hold whatever editorial positions they want. Asked by Robert Jay QC about a Sun . editorial before the election which said 'vote Clegg and you will get . Gordon Brown, he responded: 'Editorials are about expressing partial opinion and I would defend that to the death.' Mr Clegg said his contacts with . journalists and media executives were more formal since entering . government, partly because he was based in Whitehall rather than . Parliament. Mr Clegg said his contact with national . newspaper editors had been infrequent - although there had been a spike . in the run-up to last year's AV referendum. Discussing his meetings with editors and proprietors, he said he often could not remember what they talked about. 'All of these meetings are a whole lot . less intriguing and surprising, I suspect, to the outside world than it . might initially seem,' Mr Clegg insisted. 'A lot of them are fairly humdrum.' He praised the British Press for their 'campaigning zeal' - which he contrasted with that of foreign media. He said without the Guardian's pursuit of phone-hacking, the Leveson Inquiry would never have happened. He . told the inquiry: 'It is one of the great virtues of our press that . we've got the campaigning zeal in our press – I think readers like it . and it's something we should celebrate.","Nick Clegg said he had only brief contact with Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks at the dinner party in 2009 .

A Cambridge University student died after being dragged for nearly a kilometre under a double-decker bus - and even stopped to pick up passengers with her lifeless body underneath. Mingwei Tan, 20, suffered massive injuries after being hit by a N5 night bus in Hampstead, northwest London, driven by 52-year-old Shahriar Firouzian.

Model student: Mingwei Tan, 20, suffered massive injuries after being hit by a N5 bus driven by in Hampstead, northwest London, driven by 52-year-old Shahriar Firouzian . The medical student's body was found . lying in the road in Haverstock Hill after the crash, around 825m from . where her shoe came off in Pond Street when first hit by the bus. Iranian-born Firouzian, who has worked for bus firm Metroline since 2003, is standing trial accused of causing Ms Tan's death by careless driving. Hamish Reid, prosecuting, told a jury at Blackfriars Crown Court Firouzian should have spotted Ms Tan when he turned sharply into Pond Street from Hampstead Road. 'He should have anticipated that pedestrians might be present in the road in front of him', he said. Tributes: The medical student's body was found lying in the road in Haverstock Hill after the crash, around 825m from where her shoe came off in Pond Street when first hit by the bus . 'Essentially by failing to ensure that he had a clear view in front of him, he fell below the standard to be expected by a competent and careful driver and was driving without due care and attention. 'It is by this failure on his part that he collided with Ms Tan and this caused her death.' Ms Tan, a medical student at Peterhouse College, Cambridge, and president of the university's karate club, had returned from a holiday with friends to Cyprus late on September 29, 2010. Friends at university have described her as joyful, talented and enthusiastic. Popular: Ms Tan, a medical student at Peterhouse College, Cambridge, and president of the university's karate club, had returned from a holiday with friends to Cyprus late on September 29, 2010 . She took the N24 bus from Victoria . Station to Hampstead to pick up luggage from a family friend's house . where she was staying, planning to head off on another trip to Rome . later that day. But the third year student was knocked down and died shortly after getting off the N24, at around 1.45am. Bus driver Shahriar Firouzian, 52, is accused of careless driving after running over 20-year-old Cambridge medical student Ming Wei Tan in London . The court was shown CCTV footage from both the N24 and Firouzian's bus in the moments before Ms Tan was hit. Mr . Reid said: 'Ms Tan is seen walking up Hampstead Road towards the . junction with Pond Street, and she crosses Pond Street from the south to . the north on the west side of the junction. 'This . is at the time when Mr Firouzian is turning right into Pond Street, . therefore she is crossing the road directly in front of him. 'He totally fails to see her. 'She is caught by the bus and dragged underneath it towards the offside.' Firouzian stops to pick up a passenger . in Pond Street and then carries on driving up the road, unaware of . having hit a pedestrian. Mr Reid said: 'All this while, Ms Tan is underneath the bus. 'Her . body only comes free from the underside of the bus just south of the . junction with Belsize Grove, 825m after the point of the original . collision.' Passers-by soon spotted her body lying in the road and called for help, but she was declared dead at the scene. Firouzian finished his shift and only realised what had happened when he showed up for work the next day, the court was told. He was immediately suspended and later arrested and charged. Tragic loss: Miss Tan was a brilliant student at Peterhouse College, Cambridge (pictured), where friends described her as joyful, talented and enthusiastic . In a statement to police, he said he thought he may have hit a fox that night near Belsize Park tube station. Mr Reid said Firouzian was not breath tested after the crash, but is not suspected of being unfit to drive, on his phone, or under the influence of drink or drugs when the crash happened. However, he suggested Firouzian may have been looking to his right rather than straight ahead at the exact moment of hitting Ms Tan. Firouzian, of Harrow Way, Watford, Hertfordshire, denies causing death by careless driving. The trial continues.

A mother who was admitted to hospital with an aggressive flesh-eating infection just days after giving birth to twins has been reunited with the babies a month later. These heart-wrenching images show the moment Lana Kuykendall, 36, was able to hold the babies again, after her condition improved and doctors deemed her well enough to be exposed to them. 'Lana grinned from ear to ear when she was holding them,' her brother, Brian Swaffer, said after watching her renuion the newborns, Abigail and Ian. The new mother, from Greenville, South Carolina, is just one of the five victims ravaged by flesh-eating bacteria across the South, with some losing their limbs to the infection. Reunited: This is the moment Lana Kuykendall, 36, was able to hold her newborn twins again. She was admitted to hospital with a flesh-eating infection days after they were born . Kuykendall was admitted to Greenville . Memorial Hospital on May 11, after she noticed a painful spot on her . leg that was ultimately diagnosed as necrotizing fasciitis, a serious infection of the skin. It was caused by the skin bacteria Group A streptococcus, according to Dr. Bill Kelly, epidemiologist for the Greenville Hospital System. The infection grew one quarter of an inch in an hour. She has since . had almost 20 surgical procedures to contain and treat the infection, . and is tentatively scheduled to have skin graft surgery on her legs, hospital spokeswoman Sandy Dees said. Mrs Kuykendall also underwent . extensive hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but has not had to have any limbs . amputated, Ms Dees said. She has now been upgraded from critical to . 'fair' condition. First touch: Kuykendall 'grinned from ear to ear' when she held the babies, her brother said . Happy and healthy: Doctors deemed it safe for babies Abigail and Ian to be reunited with their mother . She has become more alert and responsive and has communicated by . blinking, pointing and mouthing words, family members said. 'She has improved tremendously over . the last week,' her husband Darren said. 'Although she is still in ICU, . we believe she is on the road to recovery. She looks more and more like . herself.' Another woman is being treated for necrotizing fasciitis at Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia. Graduate student Aimee Copeland, 24, has lost one leg, both her hands and her . remaining foot after she was infected when she cut herself after falling . from a homemade zip line. Doctors . blamed her infection on Aeromonos hydrophila bacteria, which are found . in fresh or brackish water and may have entered the wound when she fell . into the river. Torn away: She returned to hospital with a painful patch on her leg just 13 hours after returning home . Early detection: Mrs Kuykendall quickly recognized something was wrong as she is a paramedic. Her husband, Darren (pictured), said she has now improved and 'looks more and more like herself' A third victim of the bacteria has been . identified as 32-year-old Bobby Vaughn who became infected when he fell . out of a tree and cut his side. Vaughn has lost two pounds of flesh from . his groin and back since catching the aggressive bug. He went to the . doctor after the infection site grew from the size of a peanut to that . of a grapefruit and is recovering from five surgeries. When it came to Mrs Kuykendall, she knew . something bad had happened when she spotted the spot on her leg and . began experiencing pain that wouldn't go away, the Greenville News reported. She had been home from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where she gave birth to Ian and Abigail, for just 13 hours. Her . husband took her to the hospital and within 90 minutes, she was in . emergency surgery. Doctors removed the dead, infected flesh on her leg . in the hopes that they could stop the bacteria from spreading. Other victims: Aimee Copeland, 24, (left) remains in the hospital after her leg, foot and both hands were . amputated. Grandmother Louise Thompson (right) had infected flesh removed from her leg . Also hit: Paul Bales (left) and Bobby Vaughn (right) have both been struck down by the infection . Outbreak: Mrs Kuykendall was initially taken to hospital in Georgia. Four other people have been infected with the horrific disease in the state after sustaining cuts and wounds . Before . she went into surgery, Mrs Kuykendall and her husband Darren watched in . horror as the infection visibly spread throughout her leg. 'And the longer she sat there, the . bigger that spot got. It was initially the size of a 3-by-5 index card. But it got bigger and bigger,' Mr Kuykendall, a firefighter, told the . newspaper. 'It moved a quarter of an inch in half an hour. Then the high-risk OB physician had a suspicion of what it was.' '(We're) still in disbelief that here is . my friend, who just had these two beautiful babies, and now she is . intubated upstairs, and not able to enjoy the bonding experience, and . enjoy the babies,' her friend Kayla Moon told MSNBC. Necrotizing . fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but . extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to . something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy . skin, muscles and fat. The . disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a . minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that . kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms . include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading . bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock . are also common complications. Sufferers . must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given . powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can . become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.

A 'smirking' gunman who shot a student dead was tattooed only two days later with a teardrop design that signified he was a killer, a court heard yesterday. Kiaran Stapleton, 21, who appeared in court amid heavy security charged with the murder of Anuj Bidve, was told by shop staff that the tattoo suggested the wearer had killed someone, a jury was told. Brian Cummings QC, prosecuting, said: ‘This was pointed out in an effort to ensure this was really what he wanted and he said words to the effect that he killed his goldfish and did that count?’ 'Smirking killer': Kiaran Stapleton, pictured left before the murder, allegedly laughed as he killed Anuj Bidve . Stapleton has already pleaded guilty . to the manslaughter of Mr Bidve on Boxing Day last year on the grounds . of diminished responsibility but that admission has been rejected by . lawyers. Mr Bidve’s parents, Subhash and . Yogini, travelled from their home in Pune, India, to Manchester Crown . Court   for the start of the trial. The jury heard Indian-born Mr Bidve, . 23, had been in the UK since September 2011, when he enrolled on a . postgraduate micro-electronics course at Lancaster University. He decided to go to Manchester with friends for the Boxing Day sales instead of returning home for the holidays. The group of five women and four men . had set off from their hotel sometime after midnight and were using a . GPS phone to guide them. They were walking through Ordsall, Salford, towards Manchester city centre when they saw two men. In the dock: Stapleton facing a murder charge at Manchester Crown Court today . Emotional: Anuj's father Subhash Bidve and mother Yogini Bidve arrive at court today . Mr Cummings said as they got closer . one of the men crossed the road and approached them, asking the time. He . said: ‘One of the group answered that it was 1.30am. ‘With no warning, the male produced a gun, put it to the head of Anuj Bidve, and fired a shot. ‘He immediately fell to the ground, fatally injured. ‘The gunman smirked or laughed and ran off.’ Stapleton and his friend, Ryan Holden, . allegedly fled into the housing estate where they lived, and showered . and discarded their clothes. During the investigation, police . seized CCTV footage from a nearby garage which showed Stapleton walking . towards the scene of the shooting with Holden. Holden was arrested at . his home in Ordsall 48 hours after the shooting and initially refused to . speak to police, saying he feared for the safety of his family. Protection: Armed Police stand guard outside the court as they prepare for the arrival of Kieran Stapleton . High security: Armed police and a convoy of police cars outside the court Stapleton arrives . But he decided to give a statement after receiving assurances that they would receive police protection. He said Stapleton had been in a . long-term relationship with his cousin, Chelsea Holden, and they had had . a child together but had split up in 2011. The court heard Stapleton had been out . with Holden earlier on Christmas Day and was fine until he was told his . ex-girlfriend had slept with another man when he had been living with . her. The jury was told Stapleton was ‘p***** off’ and said something like: ‘If I see him, I’ll kill him.’ Mr Cummings alleged: ‘He then went on . to say something to the effect that this had been the worst year for him . – he’d lost his girlfriend, lost his house, lost his licence and hardly . saw his kid.’ The pair became aware of Mr Bidve and his friends as they walked home, Mr Cummings said. He added: ‘They could see they were not local. They were dark skinned and not dressed like Salford people. ‘They seemed to be having a laugh. As . they drew almost level with this group, Stapleton said to Holden “Wait . here a minute.” He then walked across the road. Tragedy: Flowers are left at the spot where Indian student Anuj Bidve was shot dead in the early hours of Boxing Day . ‘(Holden) couldn’t hear anything that . was said but he saw Stapleton raise his arm and make a gesture as though . he was asking the time. ‘Stapleton moved back a little and . Holden again saw Stapleton raise an arm, he couldn’t remember if it was . the same arm, stretch it out as if he was going to shoot and then Holden . heard a loud shot.’ Mr Cummings said: ‘He also heard a lot . of screaming and then Stapleton ran back towards him, shouting “Run!” but he was already running. ‘They ran back to Stapleton’s house where he told Holden to “Chill the **** out” and “Don’t fold on me”.’ Holden did not know Stapleton had a gun before he heard the shot, Mr Cummings added. Stapleton was arrested in the early hours of December 29. When he appeared before magistrates the next morning he gave his name as ‘Psycho Stapleton’. Mr Cummings said: ‘The prosecution do not accept this is a case of manslaughter and we seek a conviction for murder. ‘If you deliberately fire a loaded gun . at someone’s head, you must intend to cause really serious injury or . death. Kiaran Stapleton intended to kill.’ The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Kiaran Stapleton, 21, shot Anuj Bidve on street after asking him the time .

Lianne Smith faces up to 34 years in a Spanish prison after she was last night found guilty of murdering her two children. The British mother stared blankly at the floor as the unanimous verdict rang out at Girona Provincial Court, in north-east Spain. The 45-year-old is now on suicide watch after previously trying to kill herself. After eight hours’ deliberation, the jury foreman announced the panel of seven men and two women had believed Smith was ‘fully conscious’ and knew what she was doing when she smothered Rebecca, five, and 11-month-old Daniel in their beds in a Costa Brava hotel. They flatly rejected Smith’s defence claim that she was insane, pronouncing her guilty on both counts of murder. It means she faces spending the next three decades in a standard Spanish prison cell, as the jury rejected an alternative verdict which would have allowed her to serve her sentence in a psychiatric wing. Jurors agreed Smith, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, did suffer from an unspecified psychosis and from depression – but ruled she was not criminally insane. They said she ‘took advantage of  the trust the children gave her as their mother’ and their ‘defencelessness’ as sleeping children. Judge Adolfo Garcia Morales will sentence her at a later date. Outside court, prosecutor Victor Pillado Quintas said: ‘Today justice has been  done for two defenceless small children who were murdered in the most abominable and vile way – by their own mother.’ After the verdicts, the judge and lawyers in the case joined members of the jury in a local bar. Scroll down for video... Unanimous verdict: The jury rejected Smith's defence claim that she was mentally ill . Appalling case: Smith is led into the court in Girona, Spain, for the final day of her trial . Blank stare: Lianne Smith looked impassive as the unanimous verdict was read out . During a four-day trial, the court heard . how Smith killed the children after her fugitive partner, TV hypnotist . Martin Smith, was arrested on child sex charges at their home in . Barcelona. She became obsessed with the idea . that UK social services would put the youngsters in care – which she . considered a fate ‘worse than death’. She asked her daughter if she . would prefer to spend a few brilliant days with her mother or a horrible . lifetime without her. When Rebecca said she wanted to stay . with her mother, Smith took the children to the resort of Lloret de Mar . to give them ‘a perfect holiday’. They checked into room 101 of the Hotel Miramar on May 15, 2010. After two days of playing together . and posing for seaside snaps, she put them to bed at about 7pm and . waited an hour until they were asleep. Then she took a plastic shopping . bag and suffocated them. The next day – having tried to commit suicide – she instructed reception to summon Spanish police. During her trial Smith refused to answer more than 100 questions from prosecutor Victor Pillado Quintas. The jury were shown a chilling video of Smith calmly confessing to detectives as she sat on a bed in the next-door hotel room. 'Conscious': The 45-year-old looked on edge today as she waited to hear if the jury would accept her defence of mental illness . Martin Smith, who was found dead in his cell in January . She told officers: ‘I have ended the . lives of my two children. 'I gave the children a three-day holiday, a . perfect holiday. I knew they were going to take my children to England. ‘My intention was that my children and me together would go. It wasn’t just the children.’ The court heard Smith was . ‘pathologically obsessed’ with her partner Martin Smith – they shared . their surname but she was not his wife. As she was led away to the cells . last night, British social services faced questions about their role in . the tragedy. Both Cumbria and Staffordshire social . services knew Rebecca was potentially at risk when Martin Smith was . arrested on November 1, 2007, on suspicion of raping his step-daughter . Sarah, Smith’s elder daughter from a previous relationship. Yet they allowed the family to flee to Spain before Rebecca could be taken to safety. Last night a blame game erupted as . Cumbria social services said they had passed the file to Staffordshire, . who said they were relying on the police to chase the family in Spain. Martin Smith was previously thought to be the father of Daniel and Rebecca, whom his partner has admitted killing in a Spanish hotel room . Smith admits suffocating Rebecca and Daniel but claims to have been in an unsound mental state at the time of the killings . Smith in court in yesterday, where she insisted the DNA test results showing her partner was not the father of her two children must have been incorrect . Meanwhile the Spanish equivalent of social services claimed: ‘Nobody put . us on alert and so nobody took any measures to protect the children.’ Even after Martin Smith was deported . to the UK, Staffordshire social services did not ask its counterpart to . retrieve Rebecca, and two weeks later she was dead. A Staffordshire council spokesman . said: ‘During the short time the family were resident in Staffordshire, . the council did everything possible to initiate safeguarding procedures, . and have assisted police fully in their continued investigations into . this case.’ Smith is led into court yesterday after her lawyer called for her to be acquitted on mental health grounds . Smith, pictured with her son Daniel, was placed on suicide watch after learning of her partner's hanging in prison . The riddle over the dead children’s paternity took a twist yesterday when it was suggested their mother had once worked as a prostitute. Lianne Smith used to offer ‘personal services’ to clients across the North of England, police sources said. Her trial in Spain heard the bombshell DNA revelation that the children she suffocated were not fathered by her partner, paedophile Martin Smith. He killed himself in January in prison. The mystery over their true parentage was made deeper by the fact Rebecca was born in Blackpool in 2004, and Daniel was born in Barcelona in 2009. A senior police source in Britain said: ‘In the 1990s, the family had very little money and at one stage were even forced to live for some time in a static caravan. ‘During this time Lianne was offering “holistic” or “personal” services to a wide range of clients in the North, and Martin Smith would drive her to one of these sessions and wait in the car while she conducted the business. ‘It is generally understood by those investigating the case that Miss Smith was offering sexual services to those clients – that she was in fact a prostitute.’","Lianne Smith looked impassive as unanimous verdict was read out .

A man was being quizzed tonight over the nightclub murder of a 17-year-old boy, stabbed to death in a 'silent killing'. Jordan Malutshi, 17, from London, was stabbed early this morning while partying in the Face Bar in Chatham Street, Reading, Berkshire. A 31-year-old man handed himself in to police today and was being interviewed by detectives over the killing. Crime scene: Police seal off the area outside Face Bar in Reading, where Jordan Malutshi, 17, was stabbed . The venue was full of clubbers enjoying an R&B event, where Radio 1 Extra DJ Young Lion played a set. Revellers . said they did not even realise someone had been stabbed, adding that . there had been no fracas or fight in the moments before Jordan was . murdered. A woman noticed blood on her dress and told bar staff she did not know where it had come from. Jordan was found lying on the floor near the club's toilets shortly afterwards. Police called to the club at 3.50am tried to revive him at the scene before he was taken to hospital. But he died from his injuries a short time after being admitted to the Royal Berkshire Hospital, said Thames Valley Police. A murder inquiry has begun into the killing which has been described as an 'isolated incident' by police. Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Mahon, of the force's major crime unit, said tonight: 'This was an isolated incident in which a young man needlessly lost his life. 'We have a team of detectives working on the case and are committed to carrying out a full and thorough investigation into the circumstances leading to this tragic incident. 'We know there were a large number of people in the Face Bar at the time of the incident and I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has information which could assist our ongoing inquiry, to call us.' Shocking: Jordan was found lying on the floor near the club's toilets. Police tried to revive him but he died in hospital . A post mortem conducted by a Home Office pathologist this afternoon found Jordan died from a haemorrhage caused by a stab wound to the heart. Clubbers spoke of their shock at the incident, which happened 10 minutes from the scheduled end of the nightclub's 'Love Suh Nice' R&B night. One reveller, who would not be named, said: 'There was a girl who found blood on her dress. She didn't know where it had come from. 'When they found him collapsed we thought he had just been punched.' Another clubber said: 'It was about 3.50 and there were a few in from out of town. 'There hadn't been a fight, there didn't seem to be anything going on. 'The guy who had been stabbed even walked to the entrance, near to the men's toilets. 'There wasn't even an argument or a bad word said but it must have been ongoing. 'I don't know what it was to do with. I think they were from London.' About 150 people are believed to have been in the bar when the attack occurred. The clubber said: 'These nights have been running for 10 or 15 years and most of the people who go are regulars - everyone loves it and they all have a good time. 'Maybe this group came down because they thought people wouldn't know them.

The witness added: 'There has never been any problem at all, no fights or arguments or anything.'

The grown-ups had to grin and bear it. The children, however, just grinned and enjoyed the mud and rain that swamped the Isle of Wight festival over the weekend. Rain clouds may have left 55,000 music fans’ tents awash, but they brought a silver lining to youngsters who pulled on their wellies and had fun. It was the only thing to do in a June which forecasters say could end up being one of the wettest for 100 years. Although the heavy rain is set to settle down this week there is still no sign of sustained summer weather. After washing away much of the Jubilee spirit during the Queen’s celebrations earlier this month, the weather did its worst to the Isle of Wight festival. It had begun on Friday amid chaos, and when campers woke up yesterday morning it was to a sea of mud. Anyone planning to cut and run early before the festival’s scheduled end this morning certainly faced a struggle if they had a car with them. In some cases Land Rovers pulling cars required another four-wheel-drive vehicle to drag them both free of the quagmire. Extra police were due to be on duty from last night to help the getaway and avoid a repeat of Friday’s problems, when those arriving amid the mud and rain ended up in such huge traffic jams that ferry services from the mainland had to be suspended. Festival organiser John Giddings apologised but proclaimed the event, whose acts included Pearl Jam and Bruce Springsteen, a success. He said: ‘We knew it was going to happen. We were prepared. We knew there would be adverse weather conditions – it was just slow and we caused a great traffic jam and I am sorry to all those who got stuck in it. ‘I hope that I have made up for it by providing one of the best weekends of music ever. ‘There is something about adverse conditions that makes people enjoy themselves. There’s something about British people – they are going to have a good time whatever and I love them for it.’ Packing up their troubles: Violeta (left) and Ves Stevens (right) prepare to take five-year-old Orphee home from the festival . Heading through the quagmire: A mother pushes her child through the mud (left) while another girl gets swept off her feet . Splashing out: A boy in wellies appears to be stuck in the mud, but the smile on his face says all is well . He said 100 four-wheel-drive vehicles would be on hand to help drag the vehicles of those leaving out of the mud in the car parks. Matt Dobson, senior forecaster at the Meteo-Group weather centre, said: ‘This is one of the wettest Junes since 2007, which was exceptional. It could be one of the wettest Junes of the last 100 years.’ On the plus side, Britain is set for a few drier days with temperatures approaching the June average. But Met Office forecaster Rebecca Sherwin said things looked like remaining unsettled ‘for the next couple of weeks’. The . festival was affected by a deluge which saw gridlocked drivers forced . to sleep in their cars as the car parks at Seaclose Park, Newport, had . become flooded and inaccessible with mud. The queues caused ferry companies to . suspend their services and about 600 people were stranded on ferries on . the Solent as the cars could not disembark because of backed-up traffic . on the island. But . after emergency car parks were opened off-site on Friday the backlog was . cleared and sunshine even broke through for the rest of the day. Police have warned festival-goers and local residents to expect delays after the event finishes. The . traffic plan being put into place will control traffic leaving the site . during today's rush hour to enable commuters to reach their workplace . and schools as freely as possible. Transport . operators have already reported an increased flow in people leaving the . festival early to avoid the expected slow exit. Ferry companies Wightlink and Red Funnel are both operating extra sailings to help people leave the island more easily. Stuart Love, Isle of Wight Council . director of economy and the environment, said: 'This is a constantly . evolving situation but I can assure residents and festival-goers that . all agencies are working together to implement arrangements designed to . keep disruption to minimum. 'Regulating . movement from the car parks should mean that the situation today and . Monday will be very different to that on Thursday and Friday when the . congestion was unacceptable.' Chief Inspector Nick Heelan, of . Hampshire and Isle of Wight police, said: 'Getting people home safely . and returning the local roads and community to normality as quickly as . we can is our priority. 'We have extra officers drafted in from the mainland today to work with marshals to keep traffic moving. 'We . are working very closely with the organisers, the council and other . agencies to minimise disruption, and have every resource available doing . everything possible to keep people safe and moving.'

Two-year-old Jamie Heaton died instantly when an explosion tore through the family's home in Shaw, Greater Manchester last week, while mother Michelle was smoking outside. Mrs Heaton, 31, has admitted she has been wracked with guilt since the tragedy, fearing she was responsible. Grief: Michelle And Kenny Heaton visit the scene of the blast and lay a tribute to their two-year-old son Jamie . Police are still investigating the cause, but have reassured the mother-of-three her cigarette couldn't have sparked the blast. But it's little comfort for the . grief-stricken shop worker, who left her son watching Peppa Pig on TV . while she stepped outside for a smoke break. She told The Sun: 'I knew Jamie was occupied . and wouldn't be causing mischief so I got my fags and went out onto the . back step, closing the door behind me. I lit a fag, had a few puffs and . then there was a 'boom'. Tears: Michelle Heaton weeps as she reads tributes to her son Jamie . 'I feel so guilty for going outside . that day. I know that if I had been in the room with him it would have . been that quick that I wouldn't have been able to do anything. But that . doesn't stop me wishing I could have done something. 'I am just thankful I survived so that my other kids still have a mum.' After she heard the blast, Mrs Heaton raced back into the house to search for her son. Police . quickly arrived on the scene and ushered the frantic mother to a nearby . pub, where she met husband Kenny, 36, who was at work at the time of the explosion. The pair waited for four hours while police sifted through rubble, before they were given the tragic news Jamie had died. The couple take comfort in the fact their son died instantly and wouldn't have suffered. In a statement released in the aftermath of the explision, they revealed they have been able to spend 'quality time' at hospital with Jamie's body. They described Jamie as a 'happy little boy, mischievous and full of laughter (who) adored his family, his brother . and sister Jack and Jodie, they loved their cuddles and play fighting'. Police have arrested a 32-year-old gas fitter who is believed to have examined a boiler in one of the affected houses in the days before the disaster. The unnamed man has been bailed to appear in court on August 9. Officers are still waiting to speak to the couple's next-door neighbour Anthony Partington, 27, who suffered 80 per cent burns when the blast happened at his home. Police have confirmed he was under sedation in Wythenshawe hospital and will be questioned when he regains consciousness. Agony: The couple had to wait for four hours while rescue teams searched the rubble of their home for two year old Jamie's body . Steve Heywood, Assistant Chief . Constable of Greater Manchester Police, told a press conference there . had been no change in Mr Partington's condition and might not be 'for . days or even weeks'. The . landlord of the rented property has revealed it had a new, . safety-certified boiler, and checks by gas engineers have yet to . identify any faults in the area. But . is thought the boiler developed a fault last week and say it may have . caused a gas leak which could have ignited when Mr Partington lit a . cigarette. Police are also thought to be probing . claims that Mr Partington had sent a text message threatening to hang . himself after his partner, Tanya Williams, also 27, walked out on him . the night before the explosion, taking her five children - who were said . to be wearing just their pyjamas - with her.. Tragic: The Heatons take some comfort from the knowledge Jamie died instantly and didn't suffer . TV: Mrs Heaton had left Jamie watching Peppa Pig when the blast happened . Jamie's parents describe him as a 'happy' 'smiley' and 'content' little boy . Last . week the 27-year-old’s family claimed she had fled after suffering . months of drink-fuelled violence but insisted nothing Mr Partington had . said suggested he had set off the blast deliberately. According . to Miss Williams’s family, she had sneaked out along with her five . children earlier in the evening, later sending him a text message to say . what she had done. Mr Partington is currently under . police guard at a burns unit, but officers yesterday said they had . ‘significant questions’ to put to him. They have also interviewed Miss .

The Fourth of July fatal tragedies involving children being electrocuted while swimming has claimed its fourth victim. Nathan Lynham, who was shocked during celebrations at Cherokee lake, Tennessee, has died in hospital. The accident occurred when he was playing with his friend, ten-year-old Noah Winstead and the two jumped into a lake off a docked houseboat. Investigation: In a second incident, in eastern Tennessee, one 10-year-old boy died and another was critically injured after being shocked while swimming in German Creek Marina. Evidence tape covers an electrical meter located near two house boats at the marina in Bean Station . Tragedy: 13-year-old Alexandra Anderson and her 8-year-old brother, Brayden, were electrocuted while swimming near a private dock in Missouri's Lake of the Ozarks on Wednesday . Noah died at the scene and Nathan was airlifted to Children's Hospital in Knoxville, Tennesse, but died of this injuries on Thursday night.

'We . believe that somehow or another, the electricity at this point got into . the metal of the boat, and when the children touched the metal ladder . to get in, that's when the electrocution occurred,' Grangier County . Sheriff Scott Layel said. Devastating: Authorities said it was uncertain whether the boys were electrocuted in the water or when they touched the metal ladder of one of the houseboats . In a separate incident Alexandra Anderson, 13, and her . eight-year-old brother Braydon were killed by an 'unknown source of . electricity' in the Missouri lake on Wednesday.

Texas has launched a fleet of armed-to-the-teeth gunboats tasked with hunting down the Mexican drug runners that strike fear on the waterways along the US border. Almost every day gangs of sea-hardened smugglers attempt to cross the Rio Grande river in boats laden with guns, drugs or people. Their business has become so lucrative that the pirates will stop at nothing to get their precious cargos into America, and have developed a reputation for extreme violence towards anyone who stands in their way. Patrols: The Texas Department of Public Safety said the 34-foot shallow water crafts would be deployed on the Rio Grande and the Intercoastal Waterway, which separates the Texas mainland from Padre Island . 'The people we go up against, the drug cartels, . they have unlimited money and unlimited fire power,' Major Bob . Bailey, Texas Highway Patrol Special Operations, told Fox News. The new gunboats are similar to the Navy swift boats that plied the rivers of Vietnam during the Vietnam War. They are equipped with night vision technology, ballistic shielding and an arsenal of heavy machine guns capable of firing up to 900 rounds a minute. The Texas Department of Public Safety said the . 34-foot shallow water crafts would be deployed on the Rio Grande and the . Intercoastal Waterway, which separates the Texas mainland from Padre .

Armed to the teeth: The gunboats are equipped with night vision technology, ballistic shielding and an arsenal of heavy machine guns capable of firing up to 900 rounds a minute . Just last week a gruesome video depicting the . decapitation of five members of a Mexican drug cartel by a rival gang was posted on the internet in the latest atrocity in the raging battle over drug-smuggling routes. In January, one gang, known as Los Zetas, released a video . showing the hanging of two members of the gulf cartel and last month 49 . decapitated bodies were dumped along a highway by the same gang. Business time: The machine guns on board are capable of firing up to 900 rounds a minute . Look out: The 34-foot shallow water crafts would be deployed on the Rio Grande and the Intercoastal Waterway, which separates the Texas mainland from Padre Island . The Zetas, one of Mexico's most feared cartels, were founded by former . soldiers who defected from the Mexican military in 1998 to work as hired . killers for drug traffickers. They have since carved out their own . smuggling empire, expanded massively across Mexico and diversified into . kidnapping, extortion and theft of crude oil. On June 10, the dismembered bodies of 11 men and three women were discovered in the sugar-cane . farming town of Ciudad Mante in the south of Tamaulipas state, which . borders on Texas.

Just five days earlier, Mexican police found seven dismembered bodies in Pacific coast state Sinaloa, along with a message accusing authorities of cooperating with drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman - the country's most-wanted man.

A father accused of killing his teenage daughter for dishonouring their strict Pakistani culture wept yesterday as he denied he was a murderer. Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, is accused of suffocating 17-year-old Shafilea with a plastic bag in the culmination of months of rows about her Westernised behaviour. Giving evidence yesterday, his barrister told him: ‘The prosecution say you’re a murderer.’ ‘I am not,’ the Pakistan-born taxi driver responded. Scroll down to watch home video of Shafilea . Tears: Iftikhar Ahmed is seen crying in 2004 after Shafilea's body is found. Yesterday he denied murdering his daughter alongside his wife Farzana Ahmed, pictured yesterday . Asked by Tom Bayliss, QC, how it felt . to stand trial accused of murdering his own daughter, he replied: ‘I . can’t believe it – it’s devastating.’ Ahmed and his wife Farzana, 49 – seen  leaving court yesterday in handcuffs (above) – both deny murdering Shafilea. Ahmed, . who sobbed in the witness box, denied there had been any arguments on . the night Shafilea was last seen alive nearly nine years ago. He . said he had been the last one to go to bed apart from Shafilea, who was . downstairs ‘doing her homework’. The next morning, she had vanished, he . said, adding that they had assumed she had run away as she had done . twice before. Earlier in the trial, the jury heard from Shafilea’s younger sister, Alesha, that both her parents took part in a murderous attack that night – September 11, 2003. Victim: . Shafilea disappeared in September 2003 and her body was found on the . bank of the River Kent in Cumbria the following February . She claimed their mother began it by saying – in Urdu – ‘Just finish it here’, before picking up the plastic bag which her husband held in place until Shafilea went limp. Mrs Ahmed originally claimed no argument took place that night, but earlier this week she dramatically changed her account. She now says she saw her husband angrily hitting and punching Shafilea that night. The following morning, she says she asked her husband where Shafilea was, to which he allegedly responded: ‘If you care for your dear life and that of your children, don’t ever ask me this question again.’ Yesterday Ahmed was asked by his barrister how he felt about his wife. He replied: ‘I love her to bits.’ Asked if that had changed now she had altered her account, he answered: ‘No.’ Ahmed, giving evidence at Chester Crown Court, broke down as he denied ever having been violent towards his eldest daughter. Ahmed said the family had endured ‘constant attention’ from police and the media following Shafilea’s disappearance. ‘We never got any rest,’ he said, describing the coverage as ‘constant finger-pointing’. Of the impact of the trial on the family, he insisted: ‘We have been fighting to achieve justice for our daughter Shafilea.’ Shafilea’s body was found in February 2004, dumped beside a river in Cumbria. Her parents were charged with her murder after Alesha, now 23, came forward in 2010. The trial has also heard an account allegedly given by a third sister, Mevish, to a friend describing her father hitting Shafilea on the night of her disappearance. However, Mevish, now 21, told the court she had made it up. The trial continues. VIDEO: Home video of Shafilea at a family wedding in Pakistan in 2003...

She is pictured with husband John on their wedding day . The family of murdered honeymooner Michaela McAreavey have been left outraged after a Mauritian newspaper today published pictures of her body following her death. The country’s Sunday Times, a paper with no connection to any British or Irish company, used crime scene photographs of the hotel room where Mrs McAreavey was killed. Irish Taioseach Enda Kenny and Stormont Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness have also condemned the publication. The newlywed was killed while on honeymoon with her husband John at the Legends Hotel in Mauritius in January last year. Last week, two men were acquitted of her murder after an eight-week trial. A statement from members of the couple’s family said: 'As the families struggle to come to terms with the result from the trial - this action by the newspaper is not only insensitive to their grief but marks another low in the treatment of John, the two families and the dignity of Michaela.' Around 12 black and white images of the crime scene were published today in the newspaper. On the front page there is a photograph of Mrs McAreavey taken after her death - under the headline 'Exclusive'. Inside there are more images of the crime scene, including the hotel room and the bathroom. There are also close-up pictures of Mrs McAreavey’s injuries. John McAreavey and other members of the 27-year-old Irish newlywed's family stormed straight out of court on Thursday when the foreman of the jury declared Avinash Treebhoowoon and Sandip Moneea not guilty after just two hours of deliberations. The men were hotel workers at the exclusive beachside complex on the paradise island of Mauritius where Mrs McAreavey, from Ballygawley, County Tyrone, in Northern Ireland, was found strangled in a bathtub. Their acquittal now leaves the family again searching for answers over just who killed her.

'Just when it seems the system in Mauritius cannot heap any more pain and anguish on to the McAreavey and Harte families, a local newspaper publishes pictures of Michaela’s body,' he said. 'The decision of the newspaper in Mauritius to publish crime scene photographs, including pictures of Michaela’s body is an outrageous abuse that cannot be justified in any way,' he said. 'People in Mauritius need to realise that the eyes of the international community are firmly focused on their country and their justice system in the wake of the brutal murder of Michaela and the absolute failure to deliver justice for John McAreavey and the rest of family. 'This case will not simply go away as some in Mauritius seem to hope. I can assure the Mauritian authorities that people in Ireland will continue to keep a focus on this case until justice is done.' The McAreavey and Harte families’ statement added: 'The Mauritian authorities need now to match their words with actions and ensure that insensitive reporting by newspapers within their jurisdiction does not further exacerbate the violation of Michaela and the hurt to John.'","The country’s Sunday Times used crime scene .

Dancer: Ballet talent Jack Widdowson has made a miraculous recovery after the street mugging in Cardiff last year and is dancing at the Royal Bern Ballet in Switzerland . After teenage ballet star Jack Widdowson had his neck broken by a mugger demanding his mobile phone he pledged he would once day dance again. The 19-year-old who was viciously attacked during a night out visiting his brother in Cardiff was told doctors it was unlikely he would ever walk again, let alone take to the stage. But the court heard that nine months later Jack has fought back to full health due to his fitness, strength and flexibility. His alleged attacker Mohammed Mohamoed, 23, has admitted robbing Jack for his Apple iPhone last November but denies causing the injuries which had doctors fear he  would spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair as a quadriplegic. Doctors said Jack was held in a headlock and suffered spinal damage likened to a rugby injury before the young man was left unconscious on a canal tow path, Cardiff Crown Court was told today. Jack, an apprentice with the Royal Bern Ballet in Switzerland, was attacked while visiting his brother who is studying at Cardiff University. Cardiff Crown Court heard Jack was 'extremely drunk' at the end of the night out celebrating when he became separated from his brother. Prosecutor Paul Lewis QC said: . 'Mohamoed was in the city centre centre and specifically targeted Jack, . taking advantage of his extreme drunkeness. ‘He guided him to a secluded place where he broke his neck causing serious and life-threatening injuries. ‘He helped himself to his victim’s property and departed, leaving Jack to his fate.' The court heard that minutes after . the alleged attack Mohamoed was seen laughing and joking in the city . centre, even kicking a football around with a group of boys. Unemployed Mohamoed was later arrested at his home in Roath, Cardiff. He . admitted meeting Jack and robbing him of his mobile phone which he . later used to make a call to a friend in Italy before throwing it away. On stage: Jack during his debut performance just days before the attack where a robber's desire to get his hands on the 19-year-old's iPhone let to the injuries which could have robbed him of his ability to walk . Athlete: Jack is back to full health due to his fitness, strength and flexibility and will take to the stage again . But he claims Jack was unharmed when he left him in the dark alleyway in Cardiff Bay. The court heard ‘very violent force’ was required to cause Jack’s injury. Mr Lewis said: ‘When a consultant spinal surgeon first saw Jack he thought the injury would render him quadriplegic. ‘His . view was that Jack was held in a headlock - then his head and neck were . used as a lever. The injury was deliberately inflicted. ’Fortunately Jack survived and made a miraculous recovery.’ Paul Davies, senior spinal surgeon at . the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff who saved Jack's life, . said: 'It was caused caused by some form of manipulative strangle hold. 'The neck would have had to be in a violent headlock and then the head pushed down and forward with considerable force.' Dr Davies said the spinal damage suffered was similar to that seen in rugby injuries. Attacked: Jack pictured lying in his hospital bed after the mugging. His alleged attacker broke his neck with his bare hands after getting Jack into a headlock on a street where Jack was later found unconcious . United: Jack's family during a police press conference after the attack happened, left to right, his sister Chloe, brother, Mark, father Julian and mother Celia . He said: 'The force it takes to do this damage on the rugby field is enormous. 'It can be life threatening. Eighty per cent of people with these injuries have some form of permanent neurological deficit. 'Jack has done remarkably well. That is down to the fact that he is very fit, an athlete really.' Jack, . from Bath, Somerset, gave evidence through a video link saying he could . remember very few details of the night of November 5 last year. Mohamoed denies attempted murder and an alternative charge of grievous bodily harm with intent. The trial, which is expected to last four weeks, continues.

Beachgoers in Hawaii have been left mystified after millions of tiny purple creatures, curled up in balls, appeared on the shoreline. The identity of the strange, pea-sized animals - littered along the beaches of Oahu, Honolulu - has also perplexed marine biologists, who have never seen anything like it. Most of the crabs, which washed up in the surf over the past few days, were dead or dying. Scroll down for video . Millions of weird little purple balls have been washing up on the coast of Honolulu over the past few days . Many of the tiny crustaceans found on the shoreline were dead or dying . On closer inspection, scientists believe the creatures, less than an inch long, may be the larvae of 7-11 crabs . Experts at Waikiki Aquarium believe . they may be the larval stages of the 7-11 crab, a crustacean commonly . found in the area, but added there has never been an event like this . before. Norton Chan, a biologist at the aquarium, said: 'What you are seeing is a swimming stage, . probably a few more molts before they settle into their crab stage . self.' Researchers are said to be studying those which are still alive to try to find out what they will . grow to become. The 7-11 . crab (above) is so named because when first seen in the water, it has seven . spots but closer inspection reveals a further four on its underbelly. Also known as the spotted reef crab, it can grow up to 7inches long. They live in the tidepool reef - and according to legend, the spots are the results of a fight with a sea god. While the tiny crabs that washed up were purple, the 7-11 has a rusty orange shell - although its spots are maroon. It generally feeds at night on other crustaceans and invertebrates and hides during the day. The little crabs are less than an inch long and, if they are 7-11 crabs, they will eventually grow to around six or seven inches. 'The lifeguard called and asked what . these things were because she had reports that surfers were actually having . these things crawl up on their boards and onto them,' Mr Chan added. Meanwhile, one resident told KHON news: 'It's really weird. 'It looks like you want to eat it like a berry.' Another said: 'When something washes up like this, you don't know what to expect - maybe tsunami stuff.' The coastline affected stretches from Kahala to Ala Moana on the southern tip of Honolulu. Dr Andrew Rossiter, director of the Waikiki Aquarium, reckoned that the crabs were washed up after rough seas left air bubbles in their shells, leaving them unable to dive. As a result of this, they get caught up in tides and come ashore. 'It could be a flux of warm or cold water coming in but I don't have any signs of that,' Dr Rossiter told Hawaii News Now. He added: 'And if it was pollution, it would have affected other species as well, so we really don't know [why this is happening].'

Guilty: Conrad O'Donnell stalked his female co-worker while planning her kidnapping in what the judge called 'the stuff of nightmares' An obsessed salesman spent up to three years secretly building an online ‘shrine’ to a female colleague as part of a sordid plan to drug, kidnap and rape her. Conrad O’Donnell took the pretty  27-year-old’s keys while her back was turned at work and got copies made so that he could let himself into her flat while she was out. He would film himself prowling around the victim’s flat where he rifled through her underwear and made copies of her family photos and personal documents, which he stored on his laptop at home. Yesterday O’Donnell, 29, pleaded guilty to kidnap with intent to rape and was jailed for nine and a half years. The court was told that O’Donnell also secretly took pictures of the woman’s bottom as they worked together at a shop in Manchester. His obsession finally emerged when the woman woke up in the night to find him in her bedroom. He thrust a sock in her mouth and said, ‘I want you to come to my house’, before repeatedly punching her. He only fled when he became shocked at the sight of blood from her facial wounds. Police later raided O’Donnell’s home . in Failsworth, Manchester, to uncover the sinister shrine that even . included her bank statements. On the day of the attempted . abduction, O’Donnell had entered Google searches on his mobile phone . that included, ‘how to kidnap someone’, ‘strongest over-the-counter . sedative’, ‘how to conduct a lobotomy’ and ‘the best way to gag . someone’. After he was arrested, the woman told police: ‘I used to be confident but now I am shy and suffering from depression.’ She said the ordeal had forced her to . postpone an accountancy course and added: ‘This is causing me to lose . my hair because I see my future that I have worked extremely hard for . falling apart.’ Passing sentence at Manchester Crown . Court, Judge Anthony Gee QC told him: ‘The circumstances of what you did . to that poor girl is the stuff of nightmares from which she is still . suffering. Your victim was vulnerable, asleep and alone in her own flat . which had been locked. ‘It was an outrageous attack on a vulnerable woman in what should have been the sanctuary of her own home.’ Google search: On the day he attempted to kidnap his victim, O'Donnell did a Google search for 'best way to gag someone' The obsession began after the woman – . referred to in court as Miss X – took a job at a shop where O’Donnell . had already worked for two years. Nicoletta Amatino, prosecuting, said: . ‘Since the complainant started working at the shop the defendant . persistently asked her to go out with him. He would often send her text . messages and would compliment her, telling her she was beautiful. ‘She did not reciprocate his feelings . towards her and ignored his advances. He repeatedly asked her to marry . him and again she declined.’ In 2010 Miss X began a relationship with another man but jealous O’Donnell told her, ‘he was not the right type of man for her’. Miss Amatino added: ‘O’Donnell became so possessive he would stand outside the toilet door whilst she was in there at work. ‘She began to feel increasingly . uncomfortable and tried to avoid O’Donnell, something she feels affected . her relationship with other work colleagues.’ The full extent of O’Donnell’s . obsession emerged in December last year. She had gone to bed when at 1am . she was woken by the sound of someone unlocking her front door. Miss Amatino said: ‘She got out of . bed and switched on the bedroom light to find O’Donnell in her bedroom. He then pushed her back and she fell so that she lay on her back on the . floor. He knelt down beside her and pushed a sock into her mouth. ‘He said, “Stop screaming, shut up, . stop screaming. If you shut up nothing will happen to you, all I want is . you to come to my house.” He then dragged the complainant across the . floor and took hold of her arm, picking her up.’ Miss X screamed and O’Donnell punched . her in the face four times at which point he looked shocked and fled . before surrendering to police. At his home officers found 80 video clips of Miss X’s bottom and 141 of the victim using the toilet at work. There were also videos of other females using the same bathroom. O’Donnell was ordered to sign the sex offender register for life and was banned from contacting the victim indefinitely.","Conrad O'Donnell, 27, sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in jail .

Lina Prestwood, the commissioning editor for the season, said: 'Despite the fact one in four of us are likely to experience a mental health condition in our lifetime, misunderstanding and stigma persists. 'We wanted to demonstrate how outmoded attitudes towards mental illness can be - by using the archaic image of the straightjacket in conjunction with individuals whose achievements have made them some of the most celebrated Britons of all time - they also happened to have mental health conditions. 'In 2012, it is no longer straitjackets holding people back - it is discrimination that is preventing people from fulfilling their potential.' Jane Harris, associate director of charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: 'We’re pleased to see Channel 4 putting mental health on the agenda with this bold stunt. Churchill in a straightjacket is a provocative but powerful image which highlights the message that mental illness can affect anyone, no matter how able or successful.' During the season comedian Jon Richardson will investigate obsessive compulsive disorder, while Ruby Wax will follow a number of successful business people as they disclose their mental health problems to employers and in some cases their families.","Channel 4 dressed statue in a straitjacket emblazoned with 'depression'

Brave Terri tried to fight off her . attacker who pounced as she walked along Dog Kennel Walk in Dunstable . between 9.30am and 9.50am on Tuesday June 26th.

Victoria's Secret helps 'boost' the assets of cash-rich women around the world, with its bust-enhancing bras. But according to reports the lingerie company is also improving the lives of thousands of rural Indian women who are responsible for creating the garments. Traditionally confined to the house, spending their days doing chores, making meals, cleaning and looking after the family, an increasing number are said to be realising the benefits of economic freedom. Workers produce Victoria's Secret bras at the Intimate Fashions factory in Kanchipuram district, 30 km (18 miles) south of India's southern city of Chennai . Indian villager Jaya, 22, who has recently been making up one of Victoria's Secrets most popular innovations - the padded 'Very Sexy' push-up bra, said: 'I knew nothing but the village before. 'My parents just wanted me married as quickly as possible. 'They never saw me as an asset, just a burden. They did not think a woman could earn money, but look at me.' On Intimate Fashion’s massive factory floor, in India’s Tamil Nadu state hundreds of women can be seen wearing aprons and headscarves, in the Victoria's Secret signature pink. Intimate Fashions - which also produces bras for Victoria's Secret brand 'Pink' and the La Senza brand - employs around 2500 mostly female workers . Rosie Alice Huntington-Whiteley and Miranda Kerr have both fronted campaigns for the lingerie label . The firm - which also produces bras for Victoria’s Secret brand 'Pink' and the La Senza brand - is one of thousands of companies that have cropped up in the area over recent years. And Mamandur village, just a 30 minutes drive away, provides a steady pool of young women for the factory which employs around 2,500 workers. 'Thousands of companies have mushroomed here and there has been increasing competition to get good employees,' says Prasad Narayan Rege, Intimate Fashions' general manager. 'So when the World Bank and the Tamil Nadu government came to us with the idea of employing women from some of the poorest communities and give them training, we saw a good opportunity. If it wasn’t for this project, we would be in big trouble.' The World Bank provided a $350 million loan to fund the Pudhu Vaazhvu (meaning 'New Life' in Tamil) project, helping to identify jobless youths in local village committees. Workers at Intimate Fashions earn a monthly salary of around 7,000 rupees ($130) Firms are then connected with individuals and hold rural job fairs at least once a month - giving presentations, answering questions on qualifications, training and salaries - in particular focusing recruiting on young female employees. Officials say firms have to adopt 'culturally sensitive' approaches such as bringing parents to see their manufacturing units to show them the environment their daughters will be working and living in as some girls must stay in hotels set up by employers. 'Initially, it was strange to see rural women working. Our society has kept women at homes in their traditional roles as homemakers,' says Shajeevana R.V. from Tamil Nadu’s Rural Development Department. 'But now, these young women are breadwinners. Not only that, we are seeing positive social changes taking place due to these jobs. Girls, who were married off straight out of school are now delaying their marriages by three or four years.' Since this public-private partnership which began in 2005, 143,709 young people in Kanchipuram and 25 other districts, have got jobs with 421 companies, which include Intel, Nike, Samsung and Nokia, say government officials. 'Before I struggled to send my children to school, even food was a problem,' says Latta Gubendran, mother of three, whose 19-year-old daughter, Divya, works at Intimate Fashions and earns a monthly salary of 7,000 rupees ($130). 'Divya earns more than I thought possible. My two younger girls can go to school and we have bought a fridge, a television and even tiled our floors in our house. She is like the son I never had. She brings me and my family respect.' Most villagers in the region are dependent on manual labour, working on farms for a daily wage of 100 rupees ($2). The U.S. lingerie giant is currently racing to open its first UK stores before July 28 in a bid to capitilise on tourism driven by the London Olympics. It is set to open its 16,500 sq ft, three-floor Bond Street store on July 25, two days before the start of the sporting spectacular, while its Westfield Stratford City store is expected to open a day later, sources told Retail Week. The retailer, which has 1,000 stores globally, is likely to attract thousands of shoppers, who are expected to spend an extra £16.6m in the West End as a direct result of the Games.","More than 2,500 jobs created in Southern India .

A top chef who once served afternoon tea to the Queen was today spared jail after spiking chocolate truffles with ecstasy. Neil Iron, 32, laced the desserts with the party drug to ‘liven up’ a birthday celebration at the Red Lion pub in Hoxton, north London. Guest Charlie Webster had an ‘out-of-body experience’ after eating two ‘special’ chocolate truffles left over from the party, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Iron, a former head chef at The Royal Marsden hospital in Chelsea, once gave the Queen and Prince Edward afternoon refreshments when they opened a rehabilitation centre for cancer patients. He also reached the semi-finals of the National Chef of the Year awards and was named the most promising hospitality and catering student of the year while studying at Waltham Forest College. A jury of five men and seven women found Iron guilty of one count of administering poison or a noxious substance with intent. But Iron was cleared of two further identical counts relating to two toddlers who were hospitalised after sharing a chocolate pudding allegedly spiked by Iron at the pub. The court heard Iron had been cautioned last April for possession of cocaine. Sentencing Iron to nine-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months, Judge Neil Sanders said: ‘This is a difficult case and as I indicated when you were convicted, I consider it crosses the custodial threshold, and I am still of that view. ‘Happily Charlie Webster didn’t suffer particularly greatly and he had been accustomed to taking ecstasy. ‘However the real danger was there was no telling from you as to what his reaction would be and in other circumstances - if he had to drive for example - the consequences could have been very much greater. ‘I’ still at a loss to what the motivation behind this was, whether it was a prank or anything more serious. ‘Anyone who supplies to someone else in this way a class A drug is bound to receive a prison sentence. Ecstasy dessert: The Red Lion pub in Hoxton, north London, where the children were fed the laced food . Spiked: Ecstasy was added to chocolate truffles similar to these. One person who ate them had an 'out of body experience' ‘People speak extremely highly of you as a result of your career as a chef. That is something you enjoyed and is no longer going to be open to you and I am prepared to accept this is never going to be repeated.’ Judge Sanders also ordered that Iron complete 180 hours unpaid work and pay £2,500 court costs. He will also be subject to a three-month curfew from 9pm-6am. Iron, who began working at the Red Lion last September, insisted he would never put drugs in food. He claimed the chocolate truffles could have been tampered with by guests at the party, which started late on Saturday, October 8 last year. ‘It must have been a person from the party because that’s where the food was. I wasn’t in the room, I was in the kitchen,’ he said. He claimed the chocolate mousse pots were made earlier in the week, stayed in the fridge and were nothing to with the party. Accused: The chef went on trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured, where he was found guilty of one count of spiking the food . The truffles were made the day before the party, he said. ‘I took them out of the fridge and put them on a presentation plate which was left out with the guests all evening. ‘After that I returned to the kitchen as there were other areas of the pub open to the public.’ When the party ended at about 1.45am, guests brought in leftovers, including the truffles, to be stored in the kitchen overnight. ‘At that point, there were about six people milling around in the kitchen,’ Iron said. ‘They were putting stuff in boxes; other people were putting food in the fridge as well as me. ‘Before I left that night, I made sure the fridge door was closed and everything was fine.’ The next day, a couple took their two children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, to the pub for a roast dinner.

The chef denied telling Mr Webster that there were drugs in the ‘special’ chocolate truffles. He insisted: ‘I have never suggested there were drugs in any of the products - I’m not going to say to someone, ‘would you like some drug laced food products’ when you are about to sit in my restaurant and consume a lunch.’ John King, defending Iron, said Mr Webster admitted in evidence that he has ‘not been an angel’ and ‘has engaged in taking ecstasy in the past on more than one occasion’. ‘The reality is Mr Iron will not be able to work in the catering trade again. He had a good record as a chef and in terms of punishment, the result of his actions has taken that away totally.’ Iron, of Charles Gardner Court, Haberdasher Street, Hoxton, denied three counts of administering poison or a noxious substance with intent, namely methylenedioxymethylamphetamine or MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy.","Neil Iron, 32, once served afternoon tea to the Queen .

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 03:22 EST, 12 January 2012 . A new aircraft carrier strike group has been sent to the Arabian Sea - as U.S. tensions with Iran continue to escalate. The move comes as Iran threatens to close the world's most important oil shipping lane, the Strait of Hormuz, if sanctions over its nuclear programme cut off its oil exports. The U.S. military said it will stop any blockade of the strategic strait, and the top U.S. naval officer said preparing for a potential conflict there was something that 'keeps me awake at night'. New arrival: The USS Carl Vinson is now in the Arabian Sea as tensions between the U.S. and Iran continue to escalate . But the Pentagon denied any direct link between recent tensions and the movement of aircraft carriers. Spokesman Captain John Kirby said: 'I don't want to leave anybody with the impression that we're somehow (speeding) two carriers over there because we're concerned about what happened, you know, today in Iran. It's just not the case.' Military officials said the USS Carl Vinson arrived in the Arabian Sea on Monday to replace the outgoing USS John C. Stennis carrier strike group, which Iran last week warned not to return to the Gulf after departing in late December. The Stennis was due to return to its home port in San Diego but the Pentagon did not say when that would happen. Shipped out: The USS John C. Stennis left the area in December, which prompted Iran to tell it to 'never come back' Another carrier strike group, led by the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, concluded a port visit to Thailand on Tuesday and was now in the Indian Ocean. It is on track to join the Vinson in the Central Command area of operations, which begins in the neighboring Arabian Sea. A second U.S. military official added: 'It is not unusual to have two carriers in the CENTCOM theatre at the same time.' Another official said there had been two carriers in the Gulf region at least twice in the past 18 months. Tensions between Iran and the United States ratcheted up again in the past week. Iran started an underground uranium enrichment plant and sentenced an American to death for spying. Washington and Europe have stepped up efforts to cripple Iran's oil exports, and Tehran on Wednesday blamed U.S. and Israeli agents for killing an Iranian nuclear scientist. Israel declined to comment on the killing and the United States denied any U.S. role and condemned the attack, in which the scientist was blown up by a bomb attached to his car by a motorbike hitman. Iran had warned the Stennis not to re-enter the Gulf and it is unclear when another U.S. carrier will enter Gulf waters. The Pentagon has suggested only that, sooner or later, a carrier will pass through the Strait of Hormuz into the Gulf. Kirby added: 'We routinely operate our ships - all of our ships, all of our types of ships - inside the Arabian Gulf and that will continue.'","Pentagon said deployment was 'not unusual'

Faileigh Cooper, 23, allegedly resorted to fraud to pay for liposuction and lip enhancements. When questioned about the invalid payments, she claimed the surgery had left her with a burnt arm so she was considering legal action, Southwark Crown Court heard. Accused: Faileigh Cooper, 23, arrives at Southwark Crown Court with a friend. She allegedly resorted to fraud to pay for liposuction and lip enhancements . The part-time model went to the top clinic in Wimpole Street in central London for consultations on the treatment before handing over a £500 deposit. After the treatment was carried out, Cooper and a man only known as ‘Aaron’ then repeatedly called the surgery to pay the remaining balance, with £5,250 coming from the stolen cards. Prosecuting Bartholomew O’Toole said Cooper had hoped to improve her image for her modelling career. ‘What this case is about is using someone else’s credit card without their authority with a view to use that card to the extent of thousands of pounds,’ he said. ‘The background of this case was in the early part of 2011, when Miss Cooper decided to have cosmetic surgery. ‘She had made enquiries to a surgery . about having liposuction and lip enhancements at a clinic called the Dr . Alexandra Chambers Medical and Aesthetic Practice, on Wimpole Street, . central London. Treatment: The part-time model went to the top clinic in Wimpole Street in central London for consultations on the treatment before handing over a £500 deposit . The prosecution said after meeting with Dr Alex Chambers, who later treated her, she decided on the procedures which were going to cost £6,850. ‘She was or is planning to do some modelling, which no doubt meant that her appearance was important to her,' said Mr O' Toole. ‘She . initially paid an £500 deposit, and then made the rest of the payments . using credit cards, mostly or indeed exclusively on the phone,' he added. Cooper . and ‘Aaron’ called the surgery 14 times between February 21 and . February 23 last year using both legitimate and fraudulent cards to pay . off the balance . ‘A number of payments were made lawfully, and the crown say that the sum of £5,250 was made unlawfully without the authorisation of the card owners William Churchill and Constance Logan,' said  Mr O' Toole. The clinic was later informed that the card payments were fraudulent, leaving them out of pocket. Police were informed and Cooper claimed in her interview: ‘The surgery burnt my arm and I wasn’t very happy, and I was thinking of taking them to court.’ Mr O’Toole added: ‘The clinic had not heard one part of her claim. ‘When asked about Aaron she said that she was seeing him, but he was not her boyfriend, and she had met him less than 20 times after meeting him in a club. ‘She did not remember which club, know his surname or where he lived. ‘She said that she thought they were Aaron’s (credit) cards 100 per cent, and that she was desperate for the operation. Cooper, of Battersea, southwest London, denies four counts of fraud. The trial continues. Practice: The clinic she attended is in London's Wimpole Street .

A teenage girl who organised the killing of a 15-year-old schoolboy at Victoria Station on Facebook and kicked him as he lay bleeding to death was jailed for 12 years today.Victoria Osoteku had just turned 18 when she joined a 20-strong mob armed with an array of weapons as they hunted down Sofyen Belamouadden, 15, in front of hundreds of horrified rush hour commuters at the busy London train station. The teenager helped to set up the attack on the social networking site Facebook and then bought a £3.99 knife set from Argos, which was used to stab Sofyen at least nine times. Jailed: Victoria Osoteku was sentenced to 12 years in prison at the Old Bailey for her involvement in the killing of Sofyen Belamouadden . Osoteku was then seen kicking the victim as he lay helpless on he ground with stab wounds to his heart and right lung. The Old Bailey heard Osteku claimed she just ‘nudged’ him with her foot 'to see if he was okay'. But Osoteku, now aged 20, was convicted of manslaughter after giving evidence for 21 days - the longest testimony at the Old Bailey in recent years - in a four month trial. Victim: 15-year-old Sofyen Belamouadden from Acton, west London, was repeatedly beaten and stabbed to death by a gang of youths . She was also found guilty of conspiracy . to commit grievous bodily harm but the jury was unable to reach a . verdict on the charge of murder. Sentencing her to 12 years in a young . offenders’ institution, Judge Christopher Moss QC told her: 'You played a . pivotal role in the events of and leading up to that day and must take a . substantial share of the responsibility for that.' Osoteku is the 13 teenager to be sentenced for her part in the killing. Her jail term brings the total sentences handed down to 124 years. Three other teenagers - Samson Odegbune and Christopher Omoregie, both 18, along with Obi Nwokeh, 19 - were convicted of murder during a series of trials last year and jailed for 18 years each last week. Pastor’s son Femi Oderinwale, 18, along with Adonis Akra, also 18, and Samuel Roberts, 19, were each given 12 years after they were convicted of manslaughter. And Enoch Amoah, 19, and Tyrone Richards, 17, were locked up for seven years after they were found guilty of violent disorder. Lewis Sinclar, Olawale Olaribigbe and Melvin Mensah, all 18, along with Selassie Ahiaku, 19, all got two years after they pleaded guilty to violent disorder before their trial got underway last September. The attack was the result of ‘simmering tensions’ between students at a sixth form college in Ladbroke Grove, west London, and Sofyen’s fellow pupils at Henry Compton School, in Fulham. On March 24, 2010, the two groups were seen arguing at Victoria Station and one youth was left with a bloody nose. Murderers (from left to right): Obi Nwokeh, 19, Christopher Omoregrie, . 18, and Samson Odegbune, 18, were all given a life sentence and told . they must serve a minimum of 18 years . Determined to get revenge, the Ladbrooke Grove group used the social networking site Facebook to recruit ‘troops and weapons’. Osoteku, . who was taken into care at the age of eight, was at the centre of the . conversations and agreed to buy a box set of kitchen knives from Argos. The . next day, March 25, they arrived at Victoria on two buses at around . 5.14pm armed with a samurai sword, knives, sharpening steels, and metal . bars to confront the rival group. Witnesses saw ‘knives glinting in the air’ as they chased Sofyen through Terminus place and down into the underground. Accomplices (from left to right): Adonis Akra, 18, Samuel Roberts, 19, and . Femi Oderinwale, 18, were found guilty of manslaughter and given 12 . years detention each . Jailed: Tyrone Richards, 17, (left) and Enoch . Amoah, 19 (right) were found guilty of conspiracy to commit GBH and were . sentenced to seven years detention . Sofyen was pushed or fell down the . steps in to the ticket hall where he was set upon by several youths as . he lay defenceless on the floor. Sofyen . was kicked, punched, beaten and stabbed repeatedly in front of dozens . of commuters including a priest and his blood was found on at least . three knives and a sharpening steel. Proud: Abdeslam Belamouadden, the father of Sofyen, said his son 'was a star in the making' Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC described Sofyen’s murder as ‘brutal and merciless’. He told the court: 'Such was their arrogance they carried out that kind of attack in the heart of the capital in a public place. ‘That . confidence and arrogance came no doubt from the security of acting . together as a group in sufficient numbers and with a common purpose. ‘It . came too from the security of knowing that between them they were so . heavily armed as a group that no one individual, small group, police . officer or member of station staff could withstand them or stop them or . detain them in the course of what they were doing. ‘It explains why they did something so truly terrible that many will not, even now, acknowledge that they had any real part to play in it at all. ‘It explains why for a trivial slight, they executed a truly terrible revenge.’ Osoteku was the last of the attacking group to leave the scene and the prosecution claimed that she had ‘very great’ responsibility for Sofyen’s death. Mr Heywood said: ‘Victoria Osoteku was one of those who set up and organised the confrontation that led to the death.’ Osoteku admitted she was at the scene of the attack but denied being involved. She told the jury she was just following her friends and was shocked to see Sofyen being stabbed. ‘I just froze there,’ she said. ‘I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I know it was 17 seconds but it didn’t seem that short at the time. It seemed to go on for a longer time.’ Horrific: Judge Christopher Moss told the court that the 'ferocious and merciless attack' took place in front of horrified commuters at Victoria station . She denied kicking Sofyen as he lay fatally wounded and claimed she had just ‘nudged’ him with her foot. ‘I don’t know why I did it, but I just wanted to know if he was OK,’ she added. William Boyce QC, defending, urged Judge Moss to distinguish Osoteku’s case from those of the other teens convicted of manslaughter. ‘These are 24 hours that will always haunt her,’ he said. ‘She is not just going to move on. They will always be in her mind.’ Osoteku, of Mereton Mansions, Brookmill Road, New Cross, south London, denied murder, conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and violent disorder. Convicted: Victoria Osoteku, now 20, claimed she had just nudged Sofyen with her foot to see if he 'was ok' but was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter after a four month long trial at the Old Bailey .","Mob of youths armed themselves with a samurai sword, knives, sharpening steels, and metal bars to confront rival gang .

Just days after it was claimed the wayward Manchester City striker had a fling with Rooney prostitute Jennifer Thompson - it's emerged he dated and even proposed to the Manchester United star's second cousin. Glamour model Holly Henderson, who was spotted on a date with the 21-year-old back in November has come clean about their romance - and confessed she's related to Rooney. Glamour model Holly Henderson claims she's Wayne Rooney's second cousin . Ex escort Jennifer Thompson claims she had sex with Wayne Rooney and Mario Balotelli . Mario Balotelli with his long-suffering girlfriend Raffaella Fico . Miss Henderson, 33, claims she met Balotelli in a nightclub last year and the pair enjoyed a string of dates. She said: 'We went out a few times and he seemed fun. He told me he was single, so I didn't see a problem. 'It's all a bit odd. I am Wayne's second cousin though I don't know if Mario is aware of it.' Their relationship got so heated, the footballer - nicknamed Super Mario - offered to marry her if she agreed to quit modelling. 'He said he would marry me if I gave up my career,' she told the Daily Star. 'He hated my modelling.' Miss Henderson - who didn't fully explain her family connection to Rooney - said she began to have doubts about the relationship when Balotelli became controlling. She claimed he even showed up on the set of Channel 4 reality show Come Dine With . Me, because he was suspicious about her relationship with a male . co-star. She added: 'He would be constantly messaging me to find out where I was or asking me to meet him and if I didn't reply straight away he would send me angry faces.' The fling ended for good when the pair were photographed together on a date in November. The photos appeared in the media, forcing Balotelli to admit he had a girlfriend, 23-year-old Raffaela Fico. Miss Henderson insists they haven't spoken since. Just two months later, Balotelli met and began a six-week-long affair with former escort Jennifer Thompson, who found notoriety in 2010 when she claimed to have had sex with Wayne Rooney while his wife Coleen was pregnant with their son Kai. The Italy international was forced to admit the affair with Thompson when news leaked last week - his agent admitting the pair had a 'brief involvement'. News of Balotelli's fling with Henderson will be another huge blow to Rafaella Fico, his longterm girlfriend. Miss Fico has already had to suffer the humiliation of discovering Balotelli slept with Jennifer Thompson just two days before he declared his love for her infront of 47,000 fans during a game against Blackburn in February. After scoring, Balotelli lifted his shirt to reveal a t-shirt bearing the slogan 'Raffaela Ti Amo', Italian for 'Raffaela I love you'. And the revelations come just two days after he was photographed with yet another woman - a mystery blonde - in Manchester city centre.

A drunken thug who stamped repeatedly on a young woman's head aboard a crowded tram simply because she was dressed in goth-style clothes was today facing a lengthy jail term. Kenneth Kelsall, 47, battered innocent Melody McDermott after he and his accomplice Gareth Farrar, 43, spotted her on the tram in Bury, Greater Manchester. Kelsall first headbutted 22-year old Melody inside the carriage, sending her reeling across the floor. Attack: Kenneth Kensall (left) and Gareth Farrar (right) attacked a young couple aboard a Manchester tram because they were dressed in goth-style clothes . She managed to struggle to her feet and kicked out at the tram doors but Farrar then bundled her into the corner as other passengers looked on in horror. Kelsall then repeatedly punched Melody and viciously stamped on her head and face five times as she lay between two seats. Farrar thumped Melody’s friend Stephen Stafford, 29, and aimed two punches at Melody before running off. Melody suffered a fractured eye socket and swelling to her face and body and Stephen sustained a black eye and an ear injury in the attack on a Metrolink passenger tram near Bury, Greater Manchester. Ordeal: Melody McDermott, 22, suffered a fractured eye socket and swelling to her face and body while her friend Stephen Stafford sustained a black eye and an ear injury . The attack has chilling echoes of the killing in 2008 of Goth student Sophie Lancaster, 20, who was beaten to death by two teenagers in a park in Bacup, Lancashires simply because of the long dark clothing she was wearing. At Bolton Crown Court, Melody dressed in long dark dress with lacy sleeves and dyed red hair and Stephen watched from the public gallery as a judge said Kelsall, of Cheetham Hill, Cornwood Close, Manchester and Farrar of Ellingham Close, Beswick, Manchester would facing prison terms over the vicious assault in October last year. Kelsall pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was remanded in custody. Farrar pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray and was granted bail. Both men are due to be sentenced on July 2. Melody and Stephen were returning home from a night out in Bury and were on board a tram at the Metrolink platform when they were attacked by the two men. Karen Brooks, prosecuting, said Farrar and Kelsall had 'worked together' in the attack - pushing the complainant into the corner of the tram and then turning on Stephen Stafford, punching him to the ground. Comparison: The attack has chilling echoes of the killing in 2008 of Goth student Sophie Lancaster, 20, who was beaten to death by two teenagers in a park in Bacup, Lancs . 'He remembers getting kicked in the face,' said Miss Brooks. 'I understand, the complainant Mr Stafford, had quite a serious injury on his ear which required four stitches. Those injuries are more likely to have been caused by a kick than a punch.' CCTV of the attack was shown to the court, which also includes footage of a third man with the accused. Farrar’s counsel Stuart Duke said: 'There is no dispute on what has actually happened - simply the label we put on it. The co-accused approached the complainant inside the Metrolink tram and head butts her. 'She is then seen to get up and to be kicking at the doors. Mr Farrar pushed her violently into the corner and assaults the other complainant. 'Mr Farrar on video, it seems, swings two punches at the complainant, but whether they connected or not we will never know.' 'It’s an unpleasant incident, he’s certainly guilty of an affray for pushing the complainant violently out the way while he assaults the boyfriend. 'He can be seen swinging two punches against the complainant. But he is a man of 43 and effectively good character.' Mr Duke said Mr Farrar wasn’t even on the tram at the point Kelsall was inflicting violence on Miss McDerott. He added: 'His instructions were that he didn’t even know she had been head-butted. 'The co-defendant continues to kick the complainant - it is arguable to say that the main injuries were caused when my client wasn’t present.' But Judge Elliot Knopf warned they could both face jail sentences and called the incident a 'dreadful assault'. Referring to Kelsall he said: 'He comes in and head-butts her at some sort of speed and sends her flying. She gets up and kicks the door then two of them come in. 'There is a melee - that’s the only way I can describe it.' 'It seems clear from the video the person who actually perpetrated in the assault to the girl would have been Kelsall. But because this man came back in with Kelsall, there is an argument. We have all had to opportunity to see the disgraceful display. 'All the options will be kept open, including immediate custody. Anyone who saw that recording would be horrified by the events on that day.' Both Melody and Stephen declined to comment on the attack until after the sentencing hearing.But at the time of the attack Det Con Simon Swann from Bury CID said: 'This was a completely unprovoked and violent attack on two people who were returning home from an evening out. 'They were left with serious injuries that have left them both in a lot of pain.'

Her boyfriend survived the beating but Sophie died in hospital two weeks later. At the trial into her death the court heard Harris, 15 and accomplice Ryan Herbert, 16, were so violent in their attack that when paramedics arrived at the scene in Bacup they couldn’t tell if Sophie was male or female.","Kenneth Kelsall headbutted victim before stomping on her face in attack on crowded train .

Shot: Jennie Leeman was killed with a gun which her husband David kept hidden for years in a secret compartment in a bedroom wall, a court heard . A property developer  murdered his wife after she had an affair with the tenant of one of their converted barns, a  court heard yesterday. David Leeman, 60, shot his wife Jennie five times in the chest days after discovering her secret. The couple, who had been married for 17 years and had four children together, had hit a rocky patch in their relationship, the jury heard. Mrs Leeman, who was 44, started going out with 40-year-old Norman Laramy, a fellow parent she met through their children’s school. He had been living in a converted outbuilding on the Leemans’ remote farm in Devon and moved to a caravan with his new lover when their affair was discovered. A few days later, Mrs Leeman drove back to the farm with Mr Laramy and one of her daughters. There, Mr Leeman asked his wife to accompany him to his office for a quick chat which descended into raised voices, screams and the sound of gunshots. The jury heard that Leeman then pointed the semi-automatic pistol at his love rival, and told him: ‘It should have been you first.’ Mr Laramy ran from Higher Cowley Farm and hid in a field from where he called the police. After his arrest, it was said, Leeman told police: ‘I did it. She would just not listen. I shot the woman I loved because she didn’t do what I wanted.’ Leeman had accused Mr Laramy of being a drug dealer and paedophile, the court heard. He is said to have made a series of statements after the shooting, telling friends and family: ‘A man’s got to do what a man’s got to do to protect his family from perverts.’ Rural: Police outside of Higher Cowley Farm in Parracombe, Devon after Mrs Leeman was found dead last year . He is also alleged to have said: ‘If I go to my God, I do so doing something good, protecting my daughters from a paedophile.’ Prosecuting, Geoffrey Mercer QC told . the court that matters came to a head in the week running up to Mrs . Leeman’s death last September. One of her sons overheard a telephone . conversation between her and Mr Laramy and realised they were having an . affair. ‘Emotions were running high,’ Mr Mercer said, adding that the two men later met and shook hands. A few days later, when Mrs Leeman . turned up at the farm to drop off her daughter, the situation took a . violent twist. Mr Mercer said: ‘[Leeman] asked her to go with him for . two minutes and she went with him, in fact to her death. Gun: Mrs Leeman died almost instantly from chest injuries and also suffered injuries to her arms . ‘She was unaware he had a loaded gun . with him. They went into the barn and Mr Laramy heard an argument, then . Jennie screaming, then shots, then further gunshots.’ Denial: Property developer David Leeman denies murdering his wife Jennie in September 2011 . Leeman, who has admitted killing his wife, sobbed yesterday as the court was shown pictures of her body. Mr Mercer told Exeter Crown Court: ‘He . shot her with a semi-automatic pistol. 'The magazine was loaded with . five bullets and the defendant shot her five times, emptying the . magazine, at close range to her chest area. ‘She would have died very quickly.’ Leeman, from Parracombe, Devon, denies murder but has admitted . manslaughter ‘through loss of control’. Mr Mercer said: ‘The defendant shot . her having armed himself with a loaded gun, intending at the time he did . it to kill her. He is guilty of murder.’ Mr Laramy told the court: ‘I heard two . gunshots. There was a weird silence. I started running towards the . barn. 'I had my boys with me and told them to run and get the police. 'I . heard two more gunshots and as I got there, David walked out with the . gun still in his hand. 'He made a sound like a wail. ‘I went in and found Jen. I kneeled . beside her and touched her hand and told her I loved her. 'When I walked . out, I met David who was with his sons, Rene and William, and he said . “it should have been you first” and pointed the gun at me. I froze and . Rene pushed the gun away. ‘I turned around and ran. I was in a panic. I kept running up the hill until I could get a signal to call the police.’ The trial continues.

A suspected armed robber evaded police custody today after allegedly escaping through a luggage chute moments before he was arrested by officers. Anthony Morrison, 32, touched down at Manchester Airport on a flight from Amsterdam when he was due to be held for questioning. However, he is believed to have got into the secure baggage area of Terminal 3 before leaving through the main door. Detectives want to speak to Morrison in connection with an armed robbery in Oldham, Greater Manchester, in December last year, and he was due to be held at an immigration desk in Terminal One. He is understood to have contacted police from Amsterdam to say he wanted to give himself up. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: 'On Friday police were made aware that a 32-year-old man was flying into Manchester Airport from Amsterdam to be spoken to in connection with a robbery that took place in the Oldham area in December 2011. 'After the plane landed the man subsequently escaped. 'Inquiries are ongoing to find the man and a review of the circumstances of how he escaped is underway.' Two years ago, the UK Border Agency’s (UKBA) independent chief inspector criticised Manchester Airport over its security. John Vine said he’d found two areas, one thought to be in Terminal 3, which allowed travellers to walk out without passing through customs and immigration checks. Police believe that after entering the secure baggage area Morrison then left the airport through a main door in Terminal 3 . Mr Vine said: 'We observed that there were two areas in the airport where there was the potential for international passengers transferring between terminals to be able to walk out of the airport without passing through primary control points. 'It was considered serious enough to have been discussed at the level of Home Secretary yet had been removed from the airport risk register, placed on a regional risk register and not dealt with.' He added that he was concerned to discover UKBA staff had known about the 'potential risk to the border' for some time. Manchester Airport said at the time that the issues had been addressed by the UKBA.

Aftermath: The teenage driver was speeding when she mounted a curb, careered across a lawn and ploughed into a house, killing Dr Twine-Wright . Gerdes pleaded guilty in April to manslaughter, driving while high on drugs and several other charges. Nassau County Court Judge John L Case said her plea spared the victim's family the ordeal of a trial. She had faced up to 59 years in prison. Gerdes had a stolen prescription pad and over 50 painkillers, including  Xanax and Oxycodone, when she was arrested. Federal charges are pending against pharmacist Lutful Chowdhury, who is accused of illegally filling prescriptions for painkillers. Following her arrest, the court heard Gerdes told police: 'I don't feel bad, she was old.' District Attorney Kathleen Rice told the hearing: 'Kayla Gerdes' actions before, during, and after the crash prove that she cared more about her pills than the innocent woman she had just struck and killed.

A 39-year-old man was in custody Friday in connection with the deaths of a Detroit-area couple who were fatally shot, dismembered and discovered miles away in and near the Detroit River, police said. Police refused to say if the suspect was the same man who recently moved in with the victims, 42-year-old Chris Hall and fiancee Danielle Greenway, 32. That man was picked up at the house by police Thursday, neighbors said. Two bodies with no feet, heads or hands . were found Tuesday in the Detroit River and a canal that feeds the . river, a mile-wide body of water that separates Detroit from Windsor, . Ontario. In custody: Police wait outside an Allen Park, Michigan home on Friday; A man who recently moved in with a couple whose decapitated bodies were discovered floating miles away in Detroit was removed from the home by police . Charges likely are the next step, said Allen Park Police Chief James Wilkewitz, who called the deaths 'heinous' and not a random act. The suspect's name was not released. A circular saw and a suitcase were also discovered. Relatives of the victims reported them missing Wednesday after having no contact for at least five days. 'It makes my heart drop,' neighbor Samantha Dolliver said. 'They were the sweetest people. It hasn't hit me yet. But when it does, I'm going to barricade myself in a room with a pillow and cry. ... They were human beings, not a piece of scrap metal.' Police released few details at a news conference Friday but asked for the public's help in locating Greenway's van, a tan 2005 GMC Safari with Michigan license plate 7JCM9. 'We still have a lot of work left to do,' Detroit Police Chief Ralph Godbee said. Meanwhile, yellow police tape was stretched around the home while a state police evidence technician, wearing gloves and foot protection, went in and out. A car and a boat were parked in the driveway. A Greenway family friend, April Purdin, told The Associated Press that the man who was living in the home was Greenway's ex-boyfriend. Dolliver said she knew him only as 'Roger' and that he arrived about three weeks ago. More: An hour before, a fisherman discovered body parts just beneath the surface, along with a circular saw and a suitcase . Dolliver said Hall's sister was searching for the couple Wednesday and pounded on the couple's door. She had no luck. 'She said she had a feeling in the pit of her stomach that something was wrong,' Dolliver said. Dolliver's father, Richard, also a neighbor, said Hall was an electrician and Greenway worked for a cleaning service. He last saw them about a week ago. 'She made us cookies and banana-nut bread all the time,' he said of Greenway. Richard Dolliver said he asked Greenway about the man who moved in. Found: The decapitated bodies of a man and a woman were pulled from the Detroit River . 'She said he was a friend who needed help,' he recalled. U.S. Border Patrol agents spotted the first body from shore about 6:45 a.m. in Fox Creek earlier this week. The creek empties into the mile-wide Detroit River. The U.S. Coast Guard was called in to retrieve the body, and on their way to Fox Creek, guardsmen found the second mutilated body floating in the river. About an hour later, Fussell was getting ready to set up his fishing gear along the river seawall when he looked into the partially clear and greenish water near Fox Creek. About 10 feet down, he said, he saw what looked like ‘three legs.’ ‘They were submerged in the water,’ the 53-year-old said. ‘A sheet was in the water. A saw was there. A suitcase, too.’ The bodies and body parts were turned over to the Wayne County medical examiner's office, whose investigators wouldn't comment on the case. Outside of the body parts found by Fussell, police wouldn't comment on whether anything else was found in the river. They also were not sure if the body parts belonged to the bodies found floating in the water. Investigators said there were few if any clues pointing to the circumstances that led to the bodies being dumped in the water. ‘I have no idea, to be honest with you. It is different,’ Sgt. Shawn Wesley said during a news conference not far from where the body parts were found in the Detroit River, which separates Detroit from Windsor, Ontario. That section of the river, along the city's far east side, is popular with anglers who typically arrive around dawn during the warm summer months to fish for walleye, rock bass and other fish. Border patrol agents often patrol the area. Mystery: The bodies, which were also missing hands and feet, didn't provide any immediate clues about the deaths or potential suspects . Fox Creek meanders through a wooded area where small clumps of trees are broken up by pockets of high grass and tall weeds. The area has received very little . maintenance over the years, so trash — plastic soda bottles, empty packs . of cigarettes, clothing, even a baby's crib mattress — litter the . ground. A small boat sat abandoned on a rarely used parking lot. The . creek also connects to a series of narrow canals that abut backyards . and the rear of some homes. Many of those home owners have boats and . direct access to the river.","Police have man in custody in connection with deaths of Danielle Greenway, 32, and Chris Hall, 42 .

Dolce & Gabbana brought summer straight to the catwalk in Milan yesterday with their Sicilian chic collection which incorporated the rich and vibrant Italian culture. To set the scene, cactuses in pots lined the end of the catwalk as the models paraded against a rustic green wall in stripey and colourful garments perfect for a lazy summer day in the city. Entitled Sea, Sun and Love, the new line encapsulated Sicilian culture with puppet-inspired glistening chandelier earrings, head-shaped ceramic vases from Caltagirone and floral heels as well as the odd colourful pom-pom brightening up the season's flat sandal shoes. It was a summery colour splash on the Dolce & Gabbana catwalk yesterday in Milan . An 86-strong pack of model took to the catwalk to show off the striped collection against a backdrop reminiscent of a summer in Sicily . The star of the show was a basket-shaped skirt which was inspired by those traditionally used in the farming community to collect and transport fruit, but given a chic and stylish new look, of course. An emerging trend was most definitely the use of the basket to construct corsets and skirts alike with an occasional hint of lace as well as stark stripes in red, white and monochrome. Symbolising a glamorous holiday in the Italian sun, designs featured gorgeous prints of lemons, maps and Sicilian folk art. In true Dolce & Gabbanna style, the show closed to loud applause as a pack of eighty-six models in 86 different . patterned scarves took to the catwalk. Bold stripes, colourful prints and dazzling chandelier earrings were prominent on the catwalk . Basket-style dresses, skirts and corsets were the stars of the show drawing on baskets once used by women to collect fruit . The collection was a perfect reflection of the brand's newest shop in the Italian capital of Milan.

Twenty million DirecTV subscribers will again have access to television favourites like SponeBob SquarePants and Snooki after the satellite TV provider reached a deal to restore Viacom’s networks. The loss of 26 networks – including Comedy Central, MTV, VH1, and Nickelodeon – to 20million homes means the size, length and scope of this programming blackout was unprecedented to date in the U.S. pay-TV industry. Contentious relationships between program distributors and program makers are on the rise as the industry's growth appears to have peaked. Scroll down for video . Restored: DirecTV and Viacom have reached a contract agreement after . nine days' dispute, restoring all 20 channels, including MTV's Jersey Shore featuring Snooki, and SponbeBob SquarePants, right . They killed Kenny: Viewers were not able to watch Comedy Central's offensive yet hilarious animated show South Park either . 'The Viacom/DirecTV dispute may be remembered as a critical turning point in programmer, distributor negotiations,' Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger told Reuters. 'For the first time in memory, it was the distributor that won the public relations war.' While distributors typically take the brunt of the complaints about network blackouts, DirecTV argued that the increasing number of disputes with other distributors had educated customers that they would face the same problems with their rivals. 'By showing their willingness to take a blackout, and arguably winning the battle for the hearts and minds of their customers as a result, DirecTV may extract better terms from other programmers down the road,' said Juenger. Viacom said it restored all of its cable networks, including Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV and BET, which became unavailable to DirecTV customers from July 10.

Centric . MTV India . The channels went off air after DirecTV balked at what it saw as a steep increase which it said Viacom was demanding. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the new contract. But people familiar with the talks said DirecTV will pay Viacom around $600million in the first year of the seven-year contract with subsequent mid-single digit percentage increases. That would be a 20 per cent increase over the previous contract's $500million a year that was publicly stated by DirecTV Chief Executive Mike White. DirecTV previously said Viacom sought a 30 per cent increase in carriage fees, equalling $1billion over five years - a boost that DirecTV said was not justified. Viacom countered that its networks represented about 20 per cent of all viewing on DirecTV but accounted for less than 5 per cent of its programming costs. Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman said in the memo to staff that on Thursday afternoon the two companies had made a 'decisive push to hammer out a deal that we believe is fair and mutually beneficial.' In particular, DirecTV had pushed back against having the Epix movie channel tacked on the agreement, at a price of around $500million. 'They took Epix off the table in the last 24 hours and we could move ahead with a deal,' said Derek Chang, DirecTV's top programming negotiator. Mad viewers: On July 1, AMC, the company behind shows such as 1960s period drama Mad Men was removed from the Dish Network after the two companies failed to reach a new contract . Master of satire Jon Stewart of the Daily Show poked fun at the severe manner with which the blackout was being reported. ‘Viacom and DirecTV, what are you doing here? Telling people to rise up and demand it like it’s some sort of basic cable Arab Spring? I got news for you – it’s not! None of this is indispensable!’ But so some of the 20million viewers would still get the full Daily Show experience, he sent correspondent John Oliver to a couple’s home in Montclair, New Jersey, to tell them – verbatim – what they were missing. No doubt viewers of the comedy news show will be relieved to get the real thing back. Watch the video below . 'The attention surrounding this unnecessary and ill-advised blackout by Viacom has accomplished one key thing: it serves notice to all media companies that bullying TV providers and their customers with blackouts won't get them a better deal,' said Chang. On July 1, AMC Networks, the company behind shows such as Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and Mad Men, was removed from the Dish Network after the two companies failed to reach a new contract. Similar blackouts have taken place in recent years between Cablevision and Walt Disney Co's ABC; News Corp and Cablevision; and News Corp and Dish; and Time-Warner Cable Inc and Hearst Corp. Time Warner Cable Inc, the second largest U.S. cable provider, said late Thursday it had reached a deal with Hearst Corp after 16 broadcast stations were blacked out in 14 markets for eight to 12 days. DirecTV and Viacom had been in talks over a new contract but could not agree on terms before the July 10 deadline. The nine days of the blackout resulted in Viacom's channels such as Nickelodeon losing ground to competitors like The Disney Channel. DirecTV also shed some customers in the period. The new contract will let DirecTV customers view Viacom's programming on tablets, laptops, handhelds and other personal devices. Viacom shares were up 9 cents at $46.74 on the Nasdaq on Friday.

"By . Jill Reilly and Beth Stebner . PUBLISHED: . 22:18 EST, 21 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 23:17 EST, 21 July 2012 . Accused: Drew Peterson, 57, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio . Five years after he became an object of national scorn, former policeman Drew Peterson is about to go on trial on charges that he murdered Kathleen Savio in 2004. He has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for her death, and is the chief suspect in the 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife Stacy, who has never been found. The case, which begins Monday with jury selection, is sure to rekindle memories of the media frenzy that engulfed Peterson before his arrest, when he often joked with an army of news crews camped outside his house and even invited Geraldo Rivera into his kitchen. Reporters from around the country and maybe from as far away as Japan will descend on a courthouse in Joliet to watch the latest chapter of a story that has already spawned a couple of books and a cable TV movie starring Rob Lowe as Peterson. The frenetic coverage 'absolutely has the possibility of reigniting,' said Mark Geragos, a prominent California defence attorney who has been at the centre of comparable firestorms, including when he represented Scott Peterson (no relation), a California man convicted of murdering his young wife and unborn child. Prosecutors expect to tell a relatively simple story: Drew Peterson killed his ex-wife to keep her from making off with much of his money in a contentious divorce. Sometime around February 29, 2004, according to the indictment, Peterson went to Savio's house and in the bathroom caused her 'to inhale fluid,' killing her. Earlier days: Former Bolingbrook police sergeant Drew Peterson talks to the media as he leaves his home in Bolingbrook, Illinois in 2007 . In memoriam: Flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of Kathleen Savio, the third wife of Peterson, at the Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois . Observers say Peterson may benefit from the three years he's been behind bars and out of the public eye, if only because he spent much of the past three years in solitary confinement, with his only human contact being from guards bringing him meals. 'He really was becoming one of the more hated individuals in America,' Joe Tacopina, a prominent defence attorney in New York, told the AP. 'Because he was in jail, he took himself off the front page, and that can only help him with a jury pool.' Peterson's attorney agreed. 'Nobody's going to deny that Drew's relatively goofy behaviour rubbed people the wrong way,' said Joel Brodsky, who explained Peterson's actions as both the by-product of a sometimes grim job and his way of moving on after his wife left him. 'The fact that he hasn't been at that for a period of years certainly helps some of his past antics fade from memory.' But that simple story is complicated by what happened after Savio's body was discovered by a friend of Peterson's. Peterson had called the friend to the house to look for Savio, saying he was worried. The investigation unfolded nothing like the ones jurors may have seen on television programs such as 'CSI' and 'Law & Order.' Grave charges: Peterson is accused of murdering Kathleen Savio, left.  It was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub, right, but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide . Detectives are expected to testify, . as they did at a hearing in 2010, that nobody collected a single . fingerprint or hair fibre at the house. They will likely acknowledge . that Savio's relatives, who could have told investigators about the . couple's on-going battles, were never interviewed. Jurors . may also hear, as a judge did at the 2010 hearing, that Peterson was . allowed to sit in on a police interview with Stacy Peterson as a . 'professional courtesy.' This happened while officers were trying to . confirm Peterson's whereabouts the weekend Savio died. The one-time policeman of the year, told a reporter at the Chicago Sun Times: 'I’m sick of being called sinister.' Instead . he insisted he was a romantic and his disastrous track record with . women was not his fault - it was because he picked 'women who changed . after getting married.' Missing: Peterson, right, is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, right . Authorities then reopened the . investigation into the March 2004 death of his third wife Kathleen . Savio, who was initially thought to have drowned accidentally in her . bathtub. But it was reclassified as a homicide after her body was exhumed and a medical examiner ruled she drowned following a struggle. Peterson was arrested and charged with her death in May 2009 and is being held on $20million bail. During the 30 minute interview in the jail's visitor centre, Peterson . spoke about his children claiming to be a good father. He said his sons with Kathleen Savio, Thomas and Kristopher, had never asked him if he had . killed their mother because they knew he had not. He also said that he told his youngest children, Anthony and Lacy, that their mother Stacy was on vacation. They . are currently being looked after by one of his son's from his first . marriage - Peterson has six children from three of his four marriages. When asked if he missed Stacy he said . he did sometimes, but said if she did reappear the first thing he would . do is 'ask her to sign the divorce papers.' Taken in: Police Lt.

Last year it emerged that Peterson had written a dozen jail-house love letters from jail, repeatedly propositioning a woman he has known since she was 14. Diana Grandel, now 40, said the former Illinois police sergeant has been plaguing her with bizarre and increasingly sexual requests, like asking for her measurements, photos of her in a bikini as well as describing what he wants to do to her in bed.

'I like sex with a lot of foreplay, I'm more into pleasing my partner than pleasing others.'

In order to maintain his enviable new physique, he has started taking the bus to work in order to avoid the fast food options that would once lure him over before and after his working day.","Jarvez, a 28-year-old from Portland, Oregon, went from 549lbs to 267lbs over the span of one year ."

But this isn't the latest Bond film - it's is a video of how one man dealt with fireworks being hurled into his local pub in Derby. The incredible footage shows people running for their lives surrounded by flames after arsonists threw huge fireworks into a pub. Scroll down for video . Cool customer: The bemused regular watches the fireworks fly around the room as he sits at the pub table . The regular brushes a spark out of his hair as he stays seated during the explosives . The front bar of The Grampian, in . Sinfin, Derby was filled with smoke and customers had to run outside the . pub to get their breath on Tuesday night. But while everyone else - sensibly - ran for cover, the customer coolly acts as if nothing is wrong whatsoever. At one point the regular even brushes a . spark out of his hair before putting his hand on his hip and then picking up his . bar stool as he gets up to as if to leave, then calmly watches the flames and fireworks fly around the room. The regular stops to pick up his bar stool - but does not look like he's in any rush to leave the pub . The regular nonchalantly stands with his hand on his hip as he surveys the damage, after yobs threw a firework inside it . As plumes of smoke filled the room, licensee Philippa Macdonald said she feared for her 13-year-old son, Greg, who was sleeping in his room above the pub. Amid the panic she and partner Karl Richards, both 36, managed to phone the police and fire brigade, who arrived within minutes to clear the front room of the pub of smoke. Philippa said: 'It was absolutely petrifying. The fireworks were banging and popping around the room, flames were shooting everywhere. 'The regulars did not know what was happening and smoke and fireworks filled the place. It’s a miracle nobody was hurt. 'I was so scared that the flames would take hold and spread. Karl Richards and Philippa MacDonald, are shocked why someone threw a firework inside their pub, while their son Greg, 13, was in bed at the time . 'We are just so fortunate that the pub only had about four or five customers. It was quite late at night. 'If it had been an hour earlier the place would have been packed because there were a lot of people in here watching the football. 'I’ve rung all the other pubs in the area warning them about what has happened to us.' Karl said: 'I have no idea why we have been targeted. It seems like it was just a random attack. 'We don’t think this was kids, it was definitely adults because these were fireworks of the expensive variety. 'We were stood behind the bar when we saw the front door open slightly and then we saw a flame. 'Someone shouted something like ""have it, take that""and the first firework was thrown in the door, followed by the second one. 'They started fizzing and banging. One of the fireworks had 12 smaller ones that shot out from it. Both were pretty big and must have cost quite a lot of money. 'One was about eight inches square and the other was circular and a similar size. 'I can only think the reason there was no fire is because the carpet is fireproof and there was nothing too flammable lying around to catch light.' The incident happened at 11.25pm on October 23. A spokesman for Derbyshire Police said its officers were studying CCTV of the incident and appealed for information from anyone who may have seen suspicious activity in the area at the time.

President Barack Obama, who has struggled to live up to his rock star status of 2008, brought in some extra glamor to Las Vegas this time around in the form of singer Katy Perry, resplendent in a latex dress decorated with a ballot paper. At a rally and concert that attracted 13,000 people, there were screams and squeals as the pop star opened with a rendition of Al Green's soul hit - and Obama favorite - 'Let's Stay Together' and performed five songs, including 'Teenage Dream' before finishing up with her hit 'Firework.' On the screen behind her, images of Obama and his slogan 'Forward' were juxtaposed with pictures of Obama rallies, volunteers and supporters. Scroll down for video . Grand entrance: President Obama waves to supporters as he arrives for a campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada . Musical guest: Katy Perry performs for a crowd before President Obama's arrival at the Vegas campaign rally . Perry urged the crowd to take heed of a large sign imploring: 'Vote Early.' She said: 'Don't wait. Go tomorrow. How many of you are 18 here? It's going to be your first time, right?' The dress, which was revealed when a male dancer pulled another outfit of her after the first song, had 'President of the United States' across her chest with a square box on her right hip filled in next to the names of Obama and Joe Biden. Mitt Romney was on her left thigh and an empty box on her right. Man about town: Obama is on a two-day, eight state, campaign swing as the election draws closer . There were long lines for the event and metal barriers gave way at one point as the crowd crushed against them. The crowd eclipsed the 5,000 or so who turned up to see Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan in Las Vegas earlier this week.

We'll finish what we started.’ Sensation: Perry performed five songs as well as a rendition of Al Green's soul hit - and Obama favorite - 'Let¿s Stay Together' He said: 'I've come to Nevada to ask you for your vote. I've come to ask you to keep America moving forward.' Obama blasted Romney for shifting positions, leading to the condition the Obama campaign has termed ‘Romnesia’. Obama said: 'There's a cure in Nevada. All you got to do is vote.' He suggested that Romney could not be trusted. 'Trust matters,' he said. 'Who's going to look out for you? Nevada, you know me by now. You know I say what I mean and I mean what I say.' There were cheers as he said: 'We are pulling an all-nighter. No sleep. And if you’re not going to sleep, you might as well be in Vegas.' En route to the airport afterwards, he made a surprise visit to the Bellagio hotel and casino, where he greeted hundreds of workers crowded inside.

A husband who watched his wife die in a car crash gave emotional testimony in court at the trial of the Melrose Place actress accused of killing her. Fred Seeman told the New Jersey court on . Wednesday that it was like getting hit by a bomb when his car was struck . by an SUV driven by Amy Locane-Bovenizer. Mr Seeman said the SUV's headlights were 'way, way off' in the distance as he turned into the driveway of his Montgomery Township home on June 27, 2010. Trauma: Widower Fred Seeman tells the New Jersey court on Wednesday about the night he lost his wife Helene when their car was struck by an SUV driven by Amy Locane-Bovenizer . Prompted: An attorney for the actress, pictured left as Sandy in the 1990s TV series Melrose Place,  argued her having been chased by another driver causing her to speed and crash into the Seemans' vehicle . He tearfully told jurors how he heard gurgling noises from his wife Helene. The . prosecution and the defense agree 40-year-old Locane-Bovenizer was drunk. However . the defense claimed the actress was distracted by another driver who was . chasing her after she rear-ended their vehicle and Seeman turned in front of her. The woman, identified in . court as Maureen Ruckelshaus, honked her horn and flashed her lights, . causing Locane-Bovenizer to drive nearly 20 mph over the speed limit on . narrow country roads. The chase ended when the actress slammed . into the Seemans' vehicle as it pulled into a driveway. The couple had . been returning from dinner with friends at a restaurant ten . minutes from home. Mr Seeman, a 62-year-old Manhattan real estate attorney, suffered critical lung and rib injuries in the crash. Victims: Helene Zucker Seeman was killed when her car was hit by Locane-Bovenizer's vehicle while also critically injuring her husband Fred, pictured beside her, who gave testimony this week . He told the court that 2010 had been a . 'last glorious year' for the family and that he and his wife, an art . adviser, had recently watched their youngest son graduate from high . school, according to nj.com. Somerset . County Assistant Prosecutor Matthew Murphy said at the opening of the trial on October 4 that Locane-Bovenizer had . eight to ten drinks at two gatherings before the accident and had a . blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit. 'Death was probable, not merely possible,' Mr Murphy told jurors. 'These circumstances were so extreme that death was probable.' Locane-Bovenizer, a mother of two, is . charged with aggravated manslaughter and assault by auto and faces up to . 30 years in prison if she is convicted. Showing face: Former Melrose Place actress Amy Locane-Bovenizer is seen teary-eyed in a court hearing last year in what would be her first appearance battling charges of manslaughter . Reality check: Locane-Bovenizer, a mother of two who prosecutors say was highly intoxicated the night of her accident, faces 10 to 30 years in prison if convicted . Locane-Bovenizer appeared on 13 episodes of Melrose Place in 1992 in the role of Sandy Louise Harling. She also appeared in numerous movies including Cry-Baby that starred Johnny Depp, School Ties and Secretary. During court hearings last summer, a police testified that the actress was found ‘giggling’ and appearing ‘happy’ as she sat in a drainage ditch following the collision in June of 2010. A short time later, the actress asked the officer and emergency medical personnel why they were 'making such a big deal' about applying a neck brace and putting her in an ambulance, Montgomery police officer William Wilkes told the court. 'She said we were being overly dramatic,' said Officer  Wilkes. 'I said, ""The reason I’m making such a big deal is because you were just in a severe two-car collision.""' Violent path: Prosecutors said Locane-Bovenizer was being chased by a driver upset that the actress had also hit her car, causing her to slam into the vehicle that killed Mrs Seeman, pictured with one of her sons . 'After they had taken a blood sample, at some point she said, ""Am I pregnant or am I just drunk?""' Officer Wilkes told the court. He also recalled that, in the hours following the crash, Locane-Bovenizer urinated in her hospital bed, rambled incoherently and at times seemed unaware of what had just occurred. Officer Wilkes was the second officer to arrive at the crash scene after the emergency call was made at 9.16pm where he found Locane-Bovenizer sitting upright in the nearby ditch. 'Her clothes were a little messed up, dirty,' he recalled to the court. 'Her eyes were bloodshot and watery, her speech was a little slurred.' He added that the actress was 'happy giggling laughing' when he found her and alleged that during the ambulance ride she told emergency personnel that she had consumed four glasses of wine and a beer. In the hospital emergency room, he told the court that Locane-Bovenizer asked several times what had happened to her sport utility vehicle. When Officer Wilkes answered her, he said, 'She kind of acknowledged it and a couple minutes later it would be like that conversation never happened, almost.' Locane-Bovenizer eventually asked, 'I’m sorry, am I getting a DWI?' Officer  Wilkes added. The mother-of-two is married to liquor store owner Mark Bovenizer. Despite the seriousness of the incident, her attorney previously  told website TMZ  that he was 'surprised' at the aggravated manslaughter charge. 'I don't believe it is supported by the law or the facts and I think it constitutes over-reaching by the prosecutor's office,' said Mr Zwillman.","Amy Locane-Bovenizer, 40, 'slammed into Helene Seeman's vehicle killing her and critically injuring husband'

The tiny baby had been brought home just six hours before the blaze began. Kayleigh visited her surviving baby every day in hospital for five months until the child  was allowed out for the first time. In a Facebook message last week Kayleigh said: 'She is 11lbs 3oz. Getting excited now. Could be home soon but not saying until she is home. Don’t want to jinx it.' Congratulations banners were hung from the family home and there was a little party for family and friends on Monday night when they finally brought Kayleigh home. The house was set on fire around 3am the next morning as the family slept. People nearby heard Kayleigh screaming: ‘Help, us, help us’ as the fire ripped through the family home. Firefighters found their bodies shortly afterwards. The funeral was attended by firefighters who battled to save the family when the flames tore through their home last month. Pictured here is Kayleigh Buckley & baby Kimberley Buckley, who both died in the blaze that swept through their home .

'Her baby Kimberly fought bravely for many months until strong enough to come home to a house filled with balloons. 'Within hours it all, through the fire, ended in tragedy.' The service sung a number of hymns including Abide With Me, Love Divine, Guide me O Thou Great Redeemer, All Things Bright and Beautiful.

Pratik Pandya, 48, tried to stop the car containing his boy rolling away when he was killed on his driveway. He suffered abdominal injuries and a deep cut to his left leg when the VW Touran pinned him against a wall outside the family home in Isleworth, west London. Immediately after the accident, his unnamed son told his mum: 'It’s my fault, he was trying to rescue me.' Pratik Pandya, who was crushed by car his after his seven-year-old son knocked off the handbreak, and wife Nikhlia (right) The little boy later admitted accidentally releasing the handbrake as he searched for gum, West London Coroners' Court heard. Mr Pandya, an IT consultant, died two days later in hospital after three operations to try to stop internal bleeding. He was preparing to go shopping with his son and his accountant wife when tragedy struck on May 5 this year. Reading a statement made by Mr Pandya’s wife Nikhila, deputy coroner Elizabeth Pygott said: 'She could see the Touran rolling backwards with her son sat in the middle. 'Her husband was not sat inside the vehicle when it was rolling, and the driver’s door was open. Her husband was half in and half out of the vehicle. 'She could see he was attempting to do something in order to stop the vehicle, but was looking confused and unable to know what to do to stop it.’ Mr Pandya spotted the car rolling away as he went inside the semi-detached house to collect something, and rushed outside to try to stop it. Mr Pandya, 48, tried to stop the car containing his boy rolling away when he was killed on his driveway . Jane Carne, the first paramedic on the scene, said: 'He tried to stop it but got caught between the wall and the car. 'There was a lot of blood coming out of one of his calves on his left leg, and I could see a lot of blood in the foot well of the car.’ Mrs Pandya said her husband had 'twisted himself free’ after being trapped against the wall, and sat in the driver’s seat until paramedics arrived. 'Her husband was telling her he thought the child had released the handbrake,' Ms Pygott said. The inquest heard how the boy had revealed more about the incident more than a fortnight later, on May 23. 'She was with her son and sister in law, having a conversation, when Mrs Pandya said she wished the accident hadn’t happened,’ said Ms Pygott. 'Her son said he wished he hadn’t sat on the handbrake. He thought he had come in contact with the handbrake on his search for gum.’ The inquest heard the boy was strapped into a seat in the back of the car, but was able to undo the restraints and would often look in the front seat for sweets and mints. More than 30 family and friends had just left the house when the accident happened, and many rushed back to help an 'inconsolable’ Mrs Pandya. Mr Pandya was taken to West Middlesex University Hospital around 45 minutes after the crash after complaining of back and arm pain. He was rushed into surgery where three litres of blood from internal injuries was removed, and it was discovered his colon had been severely damaged. His condition deteriorated despite undergoing three operations for internal bleeding, and died at 7.05pm on May 7, two days after being admitted to hospital. His death was initially put down to a combination of internal bleeding and abdominal injuries. Ms Pygott said no one is to blame for Mr Pandya’s death after hearing it was unlikely the handbrake of the people carrier had been released accidentally. The coroner said Mr Pandya’s son should not shoulder responsibility for the freak accident as she recorded a verdict of accidental death. 'It is not for me to say, but it is not apparent there is anyone to blame for this, especially Mr Pandya’s young son,' she said. 'It is plain to me, very strongly, that this was an accident. It is not something someone could have prevented, it was untoward.’ 'In trying to prevent his car from . rolling backwards down the front drive on to the road, he became trapped . between the driver's door of the car and a brick pillar at the top of . the drive.' The Deputy Coroner . Crash investigator PC Martin Fearon inspected Mr Pandya’s car nearly two weeks after the crash, and found the handbrake was stiff but not defective. 'I examined the handbrake up to five clicks and found it held securely on a slope of a similar degree,' he said. 'My conclusion was if the handbrake was securely applied, it would hold on a slope of up to four degrees.’ Ms Pygott commented: 'It would seem pretty unlikely a seven-year-old child is going to be able to operate that unless it was done deliberately.’ PC Fearon replied: 'I would find it unlikely.' The inquest heard Mr Pandya was crushed against a pillar at the end of a garden wall, with the full force of the two-tonne car bearing down on him. 'It appears to me he attempted to get back into the vehicle as it rolled back down the drive,' PC Fearon said. 'He would have the whole weight of the vehicle through the thin edge of the door on his abdomen. It also appears, from the denting of the vehicle, that his knees and legs were doubled up around his body.’ Ms Pygott said the medical staff at West Middlesex University Hospital made all reasonable efforts to save Mr Pandya, before he died of internal injuries and bleeding. Surgeon Jason Smith said Mr Pandya lost 60 per cent of his blood after the initial accident, and lost a further 1.6 litres as his body struggled handle the severe internal injuries. 'He was very unwell and had a massive blood transfusion,' he said. 'I couldn’t stop all of the bleeding.’ Mr Pandya died despite several blood transfusions and three operations to try to stem the bleeding and release pressure on his abdomen. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Ms Pygott said: 'In trying to prevent his car from rolling backwards down the front drive on to the road, he became trapped between the driver’s door of the car and a brick pillar at the top of the drive. 'It caused severe internal injuries which were not amenable to treatment.’ She recorded a verdict of accidental death and said the cause of death was haemorrhaging and internal abdominal injuries.","Pratik Pandya lost 60 per cent of his blood in the freak accident .

A year after friends Mesfin Nega and Shimelis Yegazu made a pact to switch off the other's life-support machine should either of them suffer a horrific injury, Nega was attacked outside a nightclub - and left with irrevocable damage to his spinal cord. Now, six years after Nega woke from a coma to find he was a quadriplegic, Yegazu has fulfilled his promise - administering a lethal dose of phenobarbital to his friend before taking it himself. Police have ruled the August 14 deaths in Columbia Heights, Washington D.C. as a murder-suicide, as one official said detectives believe the two men, both 38, carried out a suicide pact. And friends speaking to the Washington Post have revealed how Yegazu stepped up to fulfill his friend's long-desired wish to kill himself - one he was unable to achieve on his own. Pact: Shimelis Yegazu, left, gave Mesfin Nega, a paraplegic, a lethal dose of a barbiturate before taking it himself - seeing through a promise they had made to end each others lives if they suffered an injury . Nega, who worked construction jobs and loved dancing at nightclubs, was left paralysed from the neck down after he was attacked by four men as he tried to get into a club in May 2006. They threw him against a metal grate and punched and stomped on him on the sidewalk; police chased them and caught one,  Miguel Angel Avalos, who was sentenced to eight years in prison. After Nega woke from an induced coma after two weeks, he was moved to a rehabilitation ward before going to live with his sister, Mamie Masfin - whom he often told he wanted to kill himself. She said he spent his days watching movies, surfing the internet with the help of special devices and was in constant pain - but knew he could not take his life. 'How would he do it?' Mamie asked. 'He couldn't scratch his nose. You had to move his arm for him.' She said that she had never thought Yegazu, who had a three-year-old daughter, would help him with his suicide - and added she does not know why the man also wanted to take his own life. Left behind: Friends said they were aware the men had made a pact seven years ago, but said they did not think Yegazu would go through with it as he had a three-year-old daughter . Devoted: Yegazu, left, told friends he felt guilty when Nega, right, was left paralysed from the neck down after he was beaten up by four men outside a nightclub in Washington D.C. in May 2006 . But a friend, Lydia Tabesse, said she had been with the men seven years ago when they first talked about turning off the other's ventilator if they suffered a bad injury. 'If anything were to happen to me, I hope you got my back. I hope you advocate on my side not to keep me on a machine,' she remembered Nega telling Yegazu, the Washington Post reported. She added that Yegazu felt guilty when his friend was put on a ventilator after his accident, aware that he had made a promise to Nega. Mamie, who acknowledged her brother's pain 'was like putting his hand in hot oil', said he would 'joke' that his relatives were selfish for keeping him alive. 'Why would you want to keep me around like this?' he would ask his family. Tabesse said that more than a year ago, Nega said that he had come across a drug in China that would help him kill himself - but that he would need someone to administer it. When she asked who would possibly help, he eventually admitted that Yegazu was going to. Scene: Nega had tried to get into a nightclub on this street in Adams Morgan, when four men set on him . She confronted Yegazu about the suicide and asked if he could see him killing himself, to which he responded: 'Not at this moment.' On August 13, Yegazu flew to Washington D.C. from his home in Colorado and the two men stayed up late watching films. When Nega's nurse returned the next day, she found the two men unresponsive. Nega had died, and Yegazu passed away five days after taking the drug, which police believe he used in pill form. Mamie later found an email exchange between the two men which had taken place days ahead of Yegazu's visit. 'Did you get enough for two?' Yegazu had asked in his email. The two friends, who had bonded over their love of nightclubs, were eventually buried side by side. A medical examiner ruled that both men died from 'acute phenobarbital intoxication.' Phenobarbital is a barbiturate.","In 2005, Mesfin Nega and Shimelis Yegazu promised to switch off the other's life support machine if they were ever in an life-changing accident .

Britain is a nation of bargain hunters, with the savviest among us spending up to 130 days of our life searching for the ultimate value-for-money deal. Hit by major recession, Brits are increasingly going to remarkable lengths to save money. A decade ago customers spent an average of five minutes contemplating prices, but many of today's shoppers spend at least 20 minutes in the aisles - and nine per cent of keen bargain hunters take a calculator with them. The ultimate bargain hunter David Dickinson, left, and British supermodel Kate Moss, right, has only popcorn to her shopping list . Research conducted by budget retailer Poundland shows that over 56 per cent of British families have cut back more than half of their weekly spend since recession hit. Jim McCarthy, CEO at Poundland, who conducted the research into weekly spending habits, said: 'More than ever, the pressure is on shoppers to make their money stretch further as they spend increasing amounts of time and energy worrying about how to avoid going over budget. 'Poundland attracts savvy shoppers who know what a real bargain looks like. With every item priced at just £1, there won't be any nasty surprises at the checkout.' With shoppers ditching luxuries such as expensive clothes, customers will be swarming to bargain basements such as this flagship Primark store on Oxford Street . Three quarters of shoppers have ditched luxuries such as clothes, and almost half of UK families have stopped purchasing air fresheners. Thirsty adults are also leaving temptation at the door, with 44 per cent omitting alcohol from their baskets. Thanks to the recession, Britain has . seen a sharp decline in the amount of 'fun' family purchases or things . that will 'make the kids smile'. Mr McCarthy continued: 'It's a sad reality that families are cutting back on 'treat' items and sticking to the real essentials. Yet while over 90 per cent of us visit 156 stores annually in order to bag the best bargains, the survey also reveals that we Brits are not half as strict or savvy as we could be. Nearly half (44 per cent) of families said they don't add up the total of their basket as they go around the store and just 'hope for the best' when they get to the checkout. Moreover, 90 per cent of people who write a grocery list then don’t stick to it.","Due to recession, 56% of British families have halved their weekly spend .

Waiting for decision: Some foster parents are cannot make a decision on whether their child goes on a school trip or stay at a friend's house . Children in foster care are being prevented from having haircuts and going on school trips because of excessive council red tape, a study has found. Thousands of foster children suffer because carers have to check with social workers before making basic decisions about their lives. Research by the Fostering Network found that one carer in five was not allowed to take a child to get their hair cut without seeking permission. A third were not allowed to give permission for a child to stay over with a friend. And 17 per cent, or almost one in five, could not allow a child to go on a school trip. Others described how they could not even get permision to take foster children on family holidays with them. One parent was banned from allowing her foster daughter to go on a school trip because she could come into contact with animals. She said: ‘My foster daughter Jane had to miss a school trip to a local farm because the local authority wouldn’t sign the consent form because there would be animals there. 'This meant that Jane had to stay at school on her own because all the other children in the class got permission.’ Another carer revealed how red tape had led to his child being bullied. ‘She came home from school crying because she didn’t know whether she would be able to go on a school trip when all of her friends could. ‘It is hard enough being in care without being made to feel different from your friends,’ he said. Another foster carer described how her child had lost friends because the council asked for police vetting before they would allow a sleepover. Missing out: Foster children often miss out and are bullied because of the delay for local authorities to make a decision on whether to give permission for them to attend outings, a study has found . Needs to change: Robert Tapsfield, chief executive at The Fostering Network says there 'needs to be a change in culture within the system' She said: ‘The local authority wanted . to run police checks on the family of our foster daughter’s friend who . she wanted to have a sleepover with. ‘This meant that her whole family . found out that our foster child was  in care and they decided they . didn’t want her to see their daughter any more.’ The Fostering Network quizzed more than 1,000 carers for its ‘Like Everyone Else’ report. Despite government pledges to tear up . red tape, 59 per cent of foster carers said it had stayed the same or . got worse since 2010. Robert Tapsfield, chief executive at . the Fostering Network, said: ‘We hear far too many examples of children . missing out on the essential experiences of childhood because their . foster carers are not allowed to make basic decisions. ‘One girl wanted to go on a school . trip, but because it took 16 weeks for the local authority to give . permission she couldn’t go. That is ridiculous and the system has to . change.’ He added: ‘The system trusts foster . carers to provide some very vulnerable children with a safe and stable . home, but it doesn’t trust them to get their hair cut. ‘Foster carers make these types of . decisions for their own children all the time and they feel undervalued . and undermined when they can’t do the same for fostered children.’ A Department for Education spokesman . said: ‘The Government is currently consulting on proposals that make it . clear that foster carers should be given the power to take day-to-day . decisions about the children in their care.’ There are more than 59,000 children . living with 45,000 foster families across the UK.

She was the last line of defence but these dramatic pictures prove how a little old lady was no match for armed robbers as they staged a daring gems raid. The elderly woman in her 80s shuffled towards the gang and waved her walking stick at one of them after she spotted them looting a jewellery store of Rolex watches. But as the brave OAP attempted to thwart the robbery the burly masked hoodlum - turned to her as she stood in the entrance of the shop then stood over her waving a samurai sword in her face. Raid: CCTV shows gang of armed men entering Fraser Hart jewellers in Rochdale armed with a crowbar an axe and a Samurai sword . Violence: The men break into a secure part of the shop as one wields the axe . Courage: The elderly woman can been seen approaching the shop front (top left) to confront the robbers . Thug: One of the gang waves a Samurai sword in the pensioner's face as she stands her ground . Escape: The thugs decide to make a swift getaway as the pensioner looks on (left) As she retreated a few paces the robber then towered over the woman telling her to 'butt out' before the gang fled the store clutching a booty worth at least £200,000. The old woman could only look on helplessly as the gang barged past her during their escape. Pictures of the dramatic raid at Fraser Hart Jewellers in Rochdale, Greater Manchester emerged as five men began jail terms totalling over 32 years over 20 raids in which jewellery worth £1.8m was stolen. One officer said: 'She was [an] extremely brave old lady to confront those men but we would never recommend anyone to do what she did. 'She obviously suspected these people were up to no good but thankfully she did retreat when one of the robbers told her mind her own business. We’re thankful she wasn’t injured at all although it must have been very shocking for her.'The robbery occurred at 10.30am on July 7 2010 when the three masked men forced the security door of the shop on Yorkshire Street then used a crow bar to break the display glass at the front of the store and stole a number of watches. The unnamed pensioner was believed to be on a shopping trip when she noticed the robbery taking place. Gang: From left, Lewis Murkin, Dale Fitzpatrick and Philip Clarke were all jailed for their part in the raid in Rochdale. They had snatched a haul worth around £200,000 from the jewellery shop . She tried to intervene and one of the offenders waved the sword in her face and hit the weapon against the window of the shop in attempt to frighten her away. The gang escaped in an Audi getaway car stolen from a house. Police captured the gang after linking them to a number of raids in which they used stolen cars to target high street jewellers. The gang would often arm themselves with weapons such as crowbars and swords to attack the jewellers during busy trading hours while members of the public were shopping, using balaclavas to disguise themselves. In August 2010 they struck at the Humberstones Jewellers in Blackburn, Lancs using weapons to force open the door and smashing the display units with crowbars. They then put up to £80,000 worth of jewellery into black bags before fleeing in a stolen car. The following day, four expensive motorcycles worth up to £13,500 were stolen during a burglary at the Manchester Motorcycle Centre on Manchester Road, Altrincham. Then in September 2010, the same gang . were involved in an armed robbery at Peter Jackson the Jeweller on St . John Square, The Rock, Bury. The . masked men drove a stolen red Subaru through a pedestrians-only area . before threatening staff with a large machete and stealing more than . £100,000 worth of watches. Sentence: Fellow gang-members Michael Stephen Bradbury (left) Paul James Smith (right) were also jailed . In another raid the gang burst into David Robinsons the Jewellers in Altrincham, during which a stolen Volvo was used to ram raid the shop before staff were threatened with crowbars and sledgehammers. A large amount of valuable watches were stolen. The gang were arrested in September 2010 after they raided a hair and beauty salon in Stockport not realising it was under police surveillance. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Dale Fitzpatrick, 28, of Seymour Avenue, Clayton, Manchester was jailed for ten years after he admitted conspiracy to rob and burgle and asked for 49 burglary offences to be consideration. Paul Smith, 26, of Devon Close, Brinnington, Stockport, was jailed for nine years and four months after admitting conspiracy and asking for 38 offences to be considered. Philip Clarke, 25, of Lymm Close, Bridgehall, Stockport was jailed for four years. Lewis Murkin, 26, of Daresbury Close, Bridgehall, Stockport was jailed for four years and eight months. Michael Stephen Bradbury, 26, of Church View, Lymm, Cheshire was jailed for three years and eight months. All pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery and conspiracy to commit burglary. Det Insp Chris Duffy, from the Force Robbery Unit, said today: 'These men were involved in a plot stretching at least four months to steal cars which would then be used to target high street jewellers. 'The mere fact the conspiracy involves more than 20 criminal acts shows just how determined and persistent these criminals were, and had it not been for my officers who locked them up and put them away for a long time, these men would undoubtedly be out there today committing more robberies. 'Make no mistake - the streets are far safer now these men are behind bars. 'I hope this case sends out a message to the criminal fraternity that no matter how long it takes, we will use all the resources at our disposal to disrupt your activities and send you to prison.'

Claim: British manufacturer Dyson, founded by inventor and entrpreneur Sir James Dyson, has filed proceedings at the High Court, alleging that rival group Bosch obtained company secrets . The German technology giant Bosch paid an engineer working at its British rival Dyson £11,500 to leak details of its revolutionary digital motors, it was claimed yesterday. The mole worked for Dyson for two years, during which he was providing secret information about the motors to a senior Bosch executive, it was alleged. Dyson, founded by inventor and entrepreneur Sir James Dyson, has filed proceedings at the High Court against Bosch demanding a return of all the information it is said to have received from the man. Such industrial espionage would pose a . serious threat to Dyson because the digital motors, which are used in . the company’s cordless cleaners and powerful hand dryers, give it a . unique sales advantage. Dyson said it had discovered an email . trail between its engineer, who worked at the firm’s design . headquarters at Malmesbury, Wiltshire, and Dr Wolfgang Hirschburger, a . vice president of engineering at Bosch. This identified contacts thought to have taken place over two years and payments totalling £11,500. The mole, who is a graduate of Chinese origin, has been dismissed by Dyson, which has not named him. It is understood that he worked for Bosch in the past before taking up other posts and then joining Dyson. Allegation: Dyson said it had discovered an email trail between its engineer, who worked at the firm's design headquarters (pictured) at Malmesbury, Wiltshire, and a senior Bosch executive . A Dyson spokesman said: ‘Bosch has . unlawfully obtained secret motor technology via an engineer employed in . Dyson’s advanced digital motor development team.

The transsexual wife killer who was granted a state-funded sex change may also be provided with  electrolysis hair removal at the cost of the taxpayer. A judge ruled that Michelle Lynne Kosilek, 63, of Mansfield, Massachusetts, who was born Robert Kosilek, should have an expert opinion to decide if the procedure is medically necessary. Electrolysis is a beauty treatment carried out at many salons, where body hair is permanently removed by applying heat to the follicle through a small probe. Scroll down for video . Attention: Convicted killer and transsexual Michelle Lynne Kosilek, 63, is to be assessed to see if she needs electrolysis hair removal... paid for by the taxpayer . The Department of Corrections was ordered to find an expert to evaluate Kosilek by November 2, according to the Boston Herald. Most male-to-female transsexuals need electrolysis treatment to remove facial hair while they are undergoing their gender change. Kosilek has already received hormone . treatments, psychotherapy and electrolysis previously while serving a life sentence . as a woman in an all-male prison. Federal Judge Mark Wolf decided last month that the killer is entitled to be reimbursed by the state for years of legal bills because the state prisons department violated Kosilek's rights by refusing to pay for a sex change. The state is appealing that decision. In a hearing set for November 19, a state prison doctor will testify that Kosilek does not need the treatment after already testifying to the same assessment two years ago. In . 2002, Wolf ruled that Kosilek was entitled to treatment for . gender-identity disorder, but stopped short of ordering surgery. Kosilek sued again in 2005, arguing that the surgery is a medical necessity. 'The . court finds that there is no less intrusive means to correct the . prolonged violation of Kosilek's Eighth Amendment right to adequate . medical care,' Wolf wrote in his 126-page ruling. Prison . officials have repeatedly cited security concerns in the case, saying . that allowing her to have the surgery would make her a target for sexual . assaults by other inmates. But Wolf found that the DOC's security concerns are 'either pretextual or can be dealt with by the DOC.' Convicted: Robert Kosilek was convicted of murder in the killing of his wife in 1990. He is pictured on May 24, 1990, being led to the county jail following his arraignment on drunken driving charges, in New Rochelle, NY . Black out: Kosilek has said that he did not remember killing his wife Cheryl . The 63-year-old legally changed his . name to Michelle Lynne Kosilek nearly 20 years ago and has been living . and dressing as a woman at the all-male MCI-Norfolk state prison. He has tried to kill himself twice and . also threatened to castrate himself because he is so distressed over . his gender identity. Wolf said the sex change was a 'serious medical . need'. According to research by psychiatry professor George R. Brown at East Tennessee State University, 27,000 people nationwide have gender identity disorder. Experts estimate 500 to 750 Americans undergo the surgery each year, with hundreds more seeking the procedure abroad. Federal courts have said prisons must provide adequate medical care, and that they must protect inmates from themselves. But correctional officials and lawmakers balk at using taxpayer money for sex-change operations that can cost up to $20,000. Brown estimates that at least 750 of the more than 2 million prisoners nationwide had gender identity disorder in 2007, his latest count. Kosilek was convicted of first-degree murder in the . killing of his wife, Cheryl, in 1990. Cheryl Kosilek was found dead in the back seat of her car in a shopping mall parking lot on Sunday, May 20, 1990. Markings showed she had been strangled . with a rope and a wire and a taxicab driver testified in court that he . had picked up Kosilek from that very mall in the afternoon and driven . him home. A few hours later, Kosilek called police to report his wife missing, suggesting that she might have gotten into a car accident. Police . picked him up at his Mansfield home and questioned him, telling him . that 'a body was found in the back seat' of Cheryl's abandoned vehicle. Kosilek . said his wife was at work all day and had intended to stop by the mall . afterwards and that he was busy at the couple's home all day. Timothy . McCaul, Cheryl's 15-year-old son who lived with the couple, said that . he called home for a ride around 5 pm and no one answered the phone. Kosilek was questioned again, only this time he left half way through the interview and said he was getting an attorney. Two days later, Kosilek was involved in a car crash at midnight. Officers found him in the driver's seat dressed in women's clothing and sent him home. On May 24, 1990, Kosilek was stopped for speeding in New Rochelle, New York, and arrested him for drunk driving. 'You would be drunk too if the police thought you killed your wife,' he said. Later, . at the police station, the defendant stated, 'Look, I had a fifteen-year-old son and a wife. I can't call my wife. I murdered my wife. Now, I . need to call a psychiatrist now.' He later admitted to a reporter that . he and his wife got into a heated argument during the day and she had . thrown boiling water in his face. He picked up a wire and blacked out, waking up days later in the hospital. 'Apparently, I did take her life,' he told the reporter. 'It was probably in self-defense.' Change: Kosilek first sued the Massachusetts Department of Correction 12 years ago . After he was indicted for the crime, he began the transition from male to female and legally changed his name to Michelle. Kosilek's lawsuit has become fodder for radio talk shows and lawmakers who say the state should not be forced to pay for a convicted murderer's sex-change operation – which can cost up to $20,000 – especially since many insurance companies reject the surgery as elective. Wolf noted that Kosilek's gender-identity disorder has caused Kosilek such anguish that she has tried to castrate herself and twice tried to commit suicide, including once while on Prozac. Kosilek's lead attorney, Frances Cohen, called the decision courageous and thoughtful. 'We feel very grateful that the judge listened very carefully to the medical experts and has given Michelle Kosilek what the prison doctors had recommended,' Cohen said. Inmates in Colorado, California, Idaho . and Wisconsin have sued unsuccessfully to try to get the surgery, making . similar arguments that denying it violates the U.S. Constitution's . protection against cruel and unusual punishment. 'This is not a choice. Transsexuals are born and not made,' said psychiatry professor George R. Brown at East Tennessee State University. 'If you didn't have this condition, why would you want to have your genitals removed, if not by a competent surgeon but by your own hand?'

A wild monkey that gained notoriety for wandering around Tampa Bay, Florida for two years - before attacking a 60-year-old woman earlier this month - has finally been captured. Wildlife officials caught the  rhesus macaque on Wednesday on a low tree branch following a five-hour stakeout in south St Petersburg. 'We concealed ourselves in the area,' Baryl Martin, spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, told CBS. 'And we waited for the monkey to approach.' Caught! The Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay has been captured after more than two years on the run . Plan: Wildlife officials staged a five-hour stake out before they caught the monkey in a tree branch . The monkey was shot with a tranquilizer dart and officials waited for its effects to set in - but the monkey ran off, leading to a chase for 50 to 100 yards. After the dash through a wooded area, wildlife trapper Vernon Yates grabbed it with his hand and a pole, and Martin said he then 'settled down quite a bit'. He was then taken to a veterinarian's office to be evaluated. Staff will check him for contagious diseases and microchips, which would lead them to a previous owner. Officials will hold him for 30 days to ensure no one claims him before trying to find him a new home. Attempted escape: A chase ensued after the monkey was hit with a tranquilizer dart but ran off . Checks: He will now be tested for diseases and authorities will try to find him a new home if he is not claimed . The capture was much simpler than initial plans to lure the monkey with companionship and food, first by using a female monkey and then Doc, a one-year-old male sitting inside a trap with fruit. Another plan that authorities had . tried was enticing him with bananas - but he always nabbed the fruit and . ran off before he could be caught. That effort came two weeks ago after a woman was attacked by the animal as she sat on her porch. The animal jumped on the woman and began scratching . and biting her, proving theories put forward by experts that its . interaction with humans would eventually lead to dangerous behaviour. Hearing her mother's screams from . inside, the woman's daughter rushed outside to her aide, grabbing the . monkey by its legs and flinging it across the garden before it scampered . away. Fears: The capture comes two weeks after the monkey jumped on a local woman and attacked her . Neighbour: The rhesus macaque has lived in the St Petersburg, Florida area since 2010 and though wildlife officials have warned that it would become a hazard if fed . 'She could hear the clicking of teeth,' her daughter told the Tampa Bay Times. 'It's been very traumatizing for her.' The . woman was treated for puncture wounds and both she and her daughter are . said to be fine after having been given shots to prevent them from . contracting infections. The . incident has ignited fear among members of the south St Petersburg . community who are well acquainted with the animal and have come to refer . to it as the Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay. It . is thought to have been separated from a colony in Silver Springs and . has been living alone in gardens belonging to Pinellas county residents . since 2010. The daughter of the 60-year-old woman . who was bitten said that it had visited their garden nearly every . morning for the past year and a half. Very serious: Steven Colbert shot a segement on the Colbert Report about the monkey in 2010 and made fun of the way it had managed to elude authorities with its resistance to tranquilisers . Long way from home: The rhesus macaque is thought to have been separated from a colony in Silver Springs before it ended up in Pinellas County and more specifically St Petersburg . She said in a statement: 'The monkey is not afraid of people. So don't got outside very often. I don't trust the monkey.' So . famous was the 40lb macaque, that it has its own Facebook page and . comedian Steven Colbert even filmed a segment about it in 2010. Chuckling . overt the monkey's ability to escape capture by wildlife experts, Mr . Colbert showed a clip from an interview in which animal rescue . professional, Vernon Yates told reporters: 'I've personally shot drugs . into this animal a dozen times and for whatever reason it doesn't seem . to affect him.' In August, a sincere Mr Yates even . appeared in a Bloomberg special speculating on whether the monkey may . show his face at the RNC in Tampa and explaining that, thanks to his . agility and speed, he could be anywhere at any time and hard to catch.","Rhesus macaque has lived in St Petersburg area since 2010 .
