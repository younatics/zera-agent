"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Doris Paver, who is said to have died in squalid conditions at St James's Hospital in Leeds after staff failed to monitor her care . A great grandmother who suffered from Parkinson's disease was repeatedly left semi-naked in soiled bedding by hospital carers in the weeks leading up to her death. Doris Paver 79, died at St James's Hospital in Leeds, where it is claimed staff failed to monitor her care and even subjected her to an unnecessary surgical procedure. Mrs Paver was admitted to the West Yorkshire hospital after collapsing at her nursing home in Leeds, and later developed several pressure ulcers and a severe bed sore. It is claimed she was stripped of her dignity after being left in a state of undress in soiled bedding on several occasions while in the hospital's care. There were also concerns that her feeding tube was fitted inappropriately into her stomach and that staff failed to control her pain. Her daughter Valerie King also alleged that the hospital took longer than needed to provide a specialist mattress. She also added that staff failed to keep records on how often she was turned over to prevent further ulcers. Mrs King, 56, was awarded a four-figure pay-out from Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust after consulting solicitors. Now she has hit out at the Trust, who she says failed to provide basic care, which in turn contributed to her mother's death in May 2011. She said: 'It was stressful enough dealing with the emotional strain of a sick mother, without the added worry about her physical well-being, a lack of adequate pain management and a loss of dignity for the duration of her stay. 'It was clear to me from the outset that mum was not getting the proactive support she desperately needed from the nursing and medical teams.' Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust has now apologised to Mrs Paver's family for the treatment she received at St James's Hospital, pictured . Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust has now apologised for the treatment of Mrs Paver while she was in their care from March 2011. They also added that they hoped to learn from previous failures. Chief nurse Suzanne Hinchliffe said: 'We recognise that, regrettably, certain aspects of Mrs Paver's care did not meet the high standards that we aim to achieve and were below the standard that she and her family were entitled to expect.' While James Thompson, medical negligence solicitor at Simpson Millar's in Leeds, who handled the case added: 'Mrs Paver suffered throughout with poorly controlled pain, a dry mouth and was left in soiled bedding with little respect to her dignity. 'This is a very sad case and the family hope that as a result of bringing these issues to the fore, the Trust will offer training and reassurance that there will not be a recurrence of such inadequate hospital care.'","Staff at St James's Hospital failed to monitor the care given to Doris Paver .

"Wayne Swan regrets 'not telling the Australian public more' about the removal of Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister . The former Treasurer believes the failure to convince Kevin Rudd to contest the first ballot after he was removed in 2010 was the party's downfall . Mr Swan said Labor should have been 'more open' about why the party dumped Kevin Rudd which would have removed him as a destabilising force within the government . Wayne Swan says it's unlikely they'll bury the hatchet over a quiet drink because Kevin Rudd 'is not a couple of beers kind of guy' Mr Swan claims Julia Gillard was 'the better politician' not just the best PM and Bill Shorten can lead the party to victory over Tony Abbott . By . Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia . For Wayne Swan the bitterness still runs deep. The former Treasurer, now sitting on Labor's backbench and in the middle of promoting his new book 'The Good Fight' on his time in government, said if there was one regret from those turbulent six years of the Rudd-Gillard governments, it was not putting an end to the Kevin Rudd threat once and for all in 2010 by way of a party room ballot. Mr Swan believes if he and his ALP colleagues had been able to convince Kevin Rudd to contest the leadership within the party room, a heavy loss would have humiliated the then PM and saved the Labor government from three subsequent years of turmoil. Scroll down for video . Wayne Swan regrets not getting Kevin Rudd to contest the 2010 party room ballot. He's convinced a heavy defeat would have stopped the ousted PM having any influence on Julia Gillard's leadership . The former Treasurer told Daily Mail Australia today that 'in retrospect we should have dealt with Kevin through his running for the leadership (against Julia Gillard) in 2010'. 'I regret not telling the Australian public more,' Mr Swan said. 'We should have been more forthright (publicly) as to the reasons why it all came about and then had a vote about it, rather than leaving it and let it sit,' Mr Swan said. The resentment over Rudd's sniping and destabilising of the Gillard leadership clearly still festers inside Wayne Swan. When mention was made of their friendship coming through the Labor ranks and Kevin Rudd being Godfather to his son, the Member for Lilley in Queensland was quick to interrupt and say: 'but that was a long time ago remember, well before I became a Minister'. The end of the road. Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan leave the leadership ballot in 2013 when the then PM was defeated by Kevin Rudd . As for letting bygones be bygones, Mr Swan said he wasn't expecting a call from the ex-PM any time soon. 'I'm not holding any ongoing grudge but he's not the let's have a couple of beers kind of guy anyway.' In his book 'The Good Fight', Mr Swan says Kevin Rudd's 'prime ministership was not built to last'. 'Its shelf life, being built on celebrity, as it was, was likely quite short unless he changed. ‘Kevin’s treatment of people was extraordinarily vindictive and juvenile. And it was frequently on display.’ Wayne Swan says he's not waiting for a phone call from Kevin Rudd 'I don't think he's a couple of beers kind of guy' He writes in the book that 'Kevin Rudd had left no stone unturned in wreaking his revenge on Julia Gillard and the government'. Mr Swan said his biggest acts of treachery was during the But he added 'all of his subsequent treachery pales into insignificance compared to what he and his agents did in the 2010 election campaign'. Mr Swan said of allegations Mr Rudd was the source of leaks from strategy room discussions as being 'an act of treachery worthy only of someone of the standing of Billy Hughes as a Labor Party rat'. Wayne Swan launches 'The Good Fight', in which he accuses Kevin Rudd of 'an act of treachery worthy only of someone of the standing of Billy Hughes as a Labor Party rat'. Just as quick, his response to the question, with hindsight, as to which of the two Prime Ministers he served was the better politician. 'I'd vote for Julia Gillard, unquestionably and I don't say that with any recall,' he added. Julia Gillard is 'unquestionably the better politician' when compared with Kevin Rudd, says Wayne Swan . As for current leader Bill Shorten, Wayne Swan has given his seal of approval. 'What he did yesterday was courageous, it was the right thing to do. That's the sort of thing  leadership is made of,' he said in reference to the ALP leader going public on Victoria Police investigations clearing him of rape allegations. And as for Labor returning to power at the next election, under Shorten. 'Too right, I'm very optimistic and you wouldn't have made that judgement six months ago.'","Wayne Swan regrets 'not telling the Australian public more' about the removal of Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister .

"By . Dominic Connolly . With the release of Helen Mirren’s new film, The Hundred-Foot Journey, cinemagoers are this weekend being transported to a quaint village in southern France. There Mirren’s icy restaurateur Madame Mallory does battle with an Indian family who have the affront to  open a restaurant next to hers. The scenes depicting Madame Mallory’s restaurant were shot at La Durantie, a belle epoque chateau where you can now buy holiday homes in the grounds. Whet your appetite:  The La Durantie chateau starred in Helen Mirren's new film The Hundred-Foot Journey and its country club has both indoor and outdoor pools . Situated in the Tarn area of south-west France, the house is being transformed into a country club and spa, and new houses and apartments can be bought off-plan. Buyers automatically belong to the country club, so they will be able to dine exactly where Madame Mallory holds court. ‘We’re keeping for posterity some of the changes the film crew made to the chateau,’ says Jeanne Boden, director of La Durantie. The chateau was lived in by a couple in their 70s until last year, when it was bought for development. Jeanne – who is English but has lived in the Tarn for 17 years – was charged with transforming it. A few months later a location scout contacted Jeanne about her own home, to see if would be suitable for the film. ‘It wasn’t right but I was able to say, “Actually, I’ve got another one..,” ’ she explains. Change ahead: La Durantie is being transformed into a country club and spa, and houses and flats start from £266,000 for a two-bedroom home and rise to £625,000 for five bedrooms . When they saw La Durantie, they knew instantly they had found their location and filming took place in October last year. ‘The weather was amazing,’ Jeanne says. ‘We often have lovely Indian summers.’ The film, based on a novel by American Richard C. Morais, is produced by Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg. The director, Lasse Hallstrom, has a track record of films about food and rural France – he directed Chocolat, starring Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp. Jeanne, 52, was even an extra in a scene when Helen Mirren serves drinks on Bastille Day. ‘The extras were mostly French and she was speaking French to them,’ Jeanne says. La Durantie is close to the village of . Castelnau-de-Montmiral amid a landscape of rolling hills, vineyards and . ancient hilltop towns. Toulouse airport is 50 minutes away by car. Tasty: Helen Mirren stars as Madame Mallory, the chef proprietress of a restaurant, The Hundred-Foot Journey . The house itself has seen several owners, including in the 1980s the Schwarzkopf family, famed for beauty products. Between the wars, nuns ran the estate, which in the  13th Century was part of a large landholding belonging to the Count of Toulouse. The country club will have a bistro, drawing room, library and two private dining rooms. There will also be 20-metre indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a spa, tennis courts, a croquet lawn, pitch and putt, a lake suitable for swimming, and outdoor dining terraces. In the first phase, 57 detached houses with up to five bedrooms will be built in the grounds, together with apartments with two or three bedrooms. All properties will have individually designed back gardens and most will have a private pool. They are due to be completed next spring, and prices start from £266,000 for a two-bedroom home and rise  to £625,000 for five bedrooms. One couple who have bought off-plan are Helen and David Ponsford, from London. They both work in IT and had made many trips to the Riviera looking for the right holiday home but found prices too high. But when Helen saw an advert for La Durantie, they flew out and bought a three-bedroom house for £393,000. Rental return was not a key reason for their purchase, but as La Durantie offers a ‘check-in and check-out’ service for rentals, the Ponsfords decided to put their home into the programme. ‘We were originally looking for a romantic, independent property before realising that a fully managed rental suits our lifestyles much better as we will be able to “lock up and leave” with no hassle,’ says Helen, 43. ‘We anticipate we might use our new home for a two-week summer holiday per year as well as numerous weekend breaks, and Christmas too.’ Meanwhile, vines are being reintroduced to the 15-hectare estate. From next year, owners will be invited to lease or buy a package of  50 vines, with custom labelling available. durantie.com, 00 33 615 54 33 13 .","The Hundred-Foot Journey was partially shot at La Durantie in France .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . An Australian man has died while surfing at a popular tourist break off the Indonesian coast at Lombok. Geoff Moase, 48, was pulled from the water at Sorga Beach in Lombok, east of Bali, on Friday morning after he was spotted floating in the surf by a local fisherman. Friends of Mr Moase's helped bring him to shore and performed CPR on the 48-year-old who was taken to an Indonesian clinic where he died a short time later. Geoff Moase, second from right, has died while surfing in Indonesia . The Gold Coast surfboard shaper was believed to have been killed by 'a harsh wave,' according to an Indonesian policeman. 'By the time he was pulled from the water, he was already so weak,' West Nusa Tenggara police spokesman Amerun said. At his Gold Coast workshop, Dovetail Surfboards, Mr Moase crafted unique boards from Australian-grown plantation timbers. He told the website surfcareers.com prior to his death of the fascination he had with surfing from a young age, describing it as his 'obsession.' 'At least half of it is just being part of a postcard-like scene,' he said. 'Surfing reminds me that I'm lucky to live in a country that's free.' A 48-year-old man was pulled 'very weak' from the water at Sorga Beach in Lombok in Indonesia on Friday . Geoff Moase was a keen surfer who   ran a board shaping business on the Gold Coast . One of those paying tribute to Mr Moase on Saturday was Burleigh Heads retailer Keith Davis, who saw Mr Moase just before he left for Indonesia. 'Geoff was an inspiring individual who really tried to help people do what they loved doing, and that was surfing,' Mr Davis said. 'He loved helping other people make their surfboards as much as he loved making his own.' He had been staying in the area for three days, police said. Meanwhile, on Nusa Lembongan, a small island just off the coast of Bali, the search continues for missing Sunshine Coast man Peter Maynard. The father-of-three from Noosa was last seen on August 27. His family, who arrived on the island on Friday, believe he went for a surf on that morning. Police say the conditions that day were relatively calm. Mr Moase's death comes after Australian Peter Luke, 27, died after being hit by a huge wave on a remote beach on the island of Sumbawa last month. Mr Luke, originally from Warrnambool in Victoria, was surfing five-metre waves when his friends lost sight of him, and eventually found his body on a nearby reef. The search continues for 46-year-old Queensland man Peter Maynard who was last seen on August 27 off the coast of Nusa Lembongan island .","Gold Coast man Geoff Moase was pulled from the water by a fisherman .

"By . Cindy Tran for Daily Mail Australia . Meet the Australian photographer who captures the sense of serenity and magical moments of miniature waves, expressing its own unique personality with colours of rainbows, shapes and textures. Deb Morris, who lives in Angourie, far north coast of NSW, shoots miniature waves that are impossible to surf from five to 30 centimetres in size at beaches across Northern NSW coastline. The 49-year-old professional photographer told Daily Mail Australia that she bought her first camera at the age of 14, but it wasn't until three years ago when she turned her love for photography into a life long career. Deb Morris started her professional photography career just three years ago where she captures the sense of serenity and magical moments of miniature waves . 'Three years ago, I was wondering what to do, so I decided to pursue my dream of being a photographer,' she recalls. 'My father had a great passion for photography so I guess he inspired me to turn my hobby into a passion.' 'I rang a couple of friends who were in the photography industry and they said to ""find a niche"".' After taking her first photograph of a micro wave on June 10 2011, she knew from that moment that she had unveiled her 'niche'. 'Growing up in Bondi, I was part of a surfing association so waves started me off in my career. 'Everyone always looks at the big waves and we tend to overlook the small waves but I think the small ones provide the fine details, give the same expression and makes us all think they're bigger than they really are in reality. 'I decided to challenge myself by working with anything under 30 centimetres - it's definitely taken me to where I'm at in my career now. 'All my photographs are taken raw, which means I don't use any water housing (waterproof) because it allows me to be more flexible and gives me the best results I want. 'So rather than just capturing frozen moments from this beautiful landscape, I have found a whole new hidden world to investigate, that of the micro or mini wave. When asked what her favourite photograph was, she said the 'jewel' picture and it was also her first photograph she sold. 'I managed to capture the 20 centimetre barrel shot which was filled with colourful glitter of jewels and I entered it in the Nikon surf award where I was the first and only female competitor. 'It was also my first photograph I sold to someone who I didn't know - which assured me that I was on the right path.' She added: 'Over 3000 images are now housed in my collection with each five to 30 centimetres waves still providing its own unique moment and a beautiful insight to the treasures of mother nature.' Ms Morris said she was one of the 12 photographers selected worldwide for an environment themed exhibition held in Korea and hopes to be in the surf exhibition on the Gold Coast next year. Spirral glass swirls taken in Yamba far north coast of NSW describing her moments where she has captured a 'moment the naked eye misses' The photographer said she doesn't use water housing and all her photographs are taken raw. 'This shot makes you think it was taken under water' The delicate lines and textures capture both break and the peak of the wave allowing for the rainbow of colours to shine through . Another amazing shot which was taken by her raw skills - tricking us to think that it was captured underwater . The colours and shape of this image reflect the perfection of the day where she captured the droplets falling off its tip just as it breaks . Ms Morris calls this the 'touchdown lick' where she has spent a lot of time focusing to capture the waves as close to perfect as they get . The condition had to be near perfect for the water to take on a glass sculpture appearance . A 'chunky lip' forming a mountain of water where in reality it was a 15 centimetre wave . Kaleidoscope of colours caught in the early hours one morning. Submerged in three foot of water, crouched in anticipation as the 10 centimetre wave formed into a tongue as if trying to reconnect with the ocean . A glass sculpture created by the backwash of a forming miniature wave . Small bait fish swimming through the 15 centimetre waves . Looking through the belly of a 15 centimetre wave, which was taken with no waterhousing . This was taken at only 8 centimetre tall of the perfect barrell rolling through on the shoreline . Overcast conditions aided the metalic effect of this 8 centimetre wave as it curled itself back into the ocean . This would be one of the smallest barrells the photographer has captured, being of 5 centimetre in size, coloured by dirty waters from rain . Sun subtley shimmered one evening over the ocean, creating a metalic effect when with five centimetre wave curled. The photographer said she was on her knees, water to her waist, using no water housing as she captured this . The full midday sun beaming through the top of this 10 centimetre wave, which highlighted the exotic colours on show. Morris said: 'I was waste deep in water with no water housing as this glass formation touched down..' Submerged two foot in water without water housing, slightly crouched in anticipation of what the approaching wave was going to do, as this 15 centimetre wave started to curl its way into the shoreline as she was able to capture the inner beauty . As this 15 centimetre wave crashes to shore, it presents itself as a main of hair with each strand being branded by a glow of the morning sun . Laying flat on the sand, a foot from the forming face of the wave with no water housing. Ms Morris said: 'I was able to capture the reflection of this 10 centimetre of wave tanned by the flood waters passing down river with the morning sun providing the perfect lighting .

"By . Belinda Robinson . and Snejana Farberov . A teenage couple from Colorado accused of murdering the boy's grandfather and killing and dismembering his grandmother for his inheritance could face the death penalty. Prosecutors are actively seeking the maximum penalty for Brendan Johnson, 20, and his girlfriend, 18-year-old Cassandra Rieb from Colorado, who allegedly strangled Charles and Shirley Severance, both 70, to death at their home in Sterling in May. Police say Rieb told them Johnson wanted to inherit their house and $20,000 from their checking account. Scroll down for video . 'Criminal duo': Brendan Johnson, 19 (left), and his girlfriend, Cassandra Rieb, 18 (right), could face the death penalty for allegedly murdering the boy's grandparents in order to get their hands on $20,000 . Crime scene: Police performing a welfare check found Charles Severance's body inside his Sterling, Colorado, home nine days after the murder . District Attorney Brittny Lewton said Friday that Johnson and Rieb are charged with 14 and 13 felony counts respectively, including two counts of first-degree murder in the horrific deaths. Johnson was just 19 at the time of the slaying. Police say the teens dumped some of Shirley Severance's remains at a reservoir near Sterling and others about 30 miles away across the state line in Lorenzo, Nebraska. The body of Charles Severance was discovered in his home in the 400 block of South Third Avenue on May 29 after Brendan Johnson contacted police asking them to perform a welfare check. According to court documents, the couple admitted that they had begun planning the murders in early May following their arrest. ‘We had agreed to do it together; Obviously… like one get one and the other get the other one,’ Cassandra Reib was allegedly quoted as saying in the affidavit obtained by The Denver Channel. According to the document, Rieb told investigators Shirley Severance offered her and her grandson money, but the pair stabbed and strangled the woman to death anyway. Johnson allegedly said he and Rieb entered his grandparents’ Sterling home on May 20. The 70-year-old Mr Severance put up a fight, and Johnson told police he believed the elderly man ultimately died of a heart attack. Motive: Police say the Walmart worker wanted to inherit $20,000 and his grandparents' home . In the meantime his girlfriend confronted and tried to strangle Shirley Severance. The woman’s grandson attempted to slit her throat, but missed and cut her jaw. Mrs Severance tried to flee, but Johnson pulled her back into the house and stabbed her multiple times before strangling her with a string. Before she died, Shirley Severance reportedly asked her attackers ‘why are you doing this to me?’ according to Rieb. Johnson allegedly responded: ‘You know why.’ Victim: Shirley Severance, 70, was stabbed multiple times, strangled to death with a string, burned and dismembered . The couple escaped in Charles Severance’ truck after Johnson allegedly wrote out two fake checks and forged his grandfather’s signature. The 19-year-old Walmart employee used the stolen vehicle to go to a concert in Denver and to dispose of his grandmother's corpse. To cover up the evidence, the couple burned and buried the 70-year-old woman's body in two separate locations. Johnson revealed during questioning that after he doused his grandmother’s body with gasoline and lit it on fire at a reservoir near Sterling, he tried to hack off an arm and a leg. The pair came back to collect the scorched remains buried in a fire pit a few days later, but could not get to them because there were people camping in the area. They made a third trip to the reservoir May 28, at which time they dug up the body and re-interred it in Nebraska. Johnson's next court appearance will be October 27 and Rieb's will be September 19.

"By . Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . Union whistleblower Kathy Jackson said her affair with union barrister Mark Irving was a mistake and and described having a one-night fling with him as nothing more than 'a charity shag' which would take place in a lounge-room with a barber's chair. Ms Jackson's comments outside the royal commission into union corruption follow her unsuccessful bid to prevent Mr Irving from cross examining her, claiming yesterday in an affidavit that he would be biased. But her claim was ultimately rejected by the commission. Speaking outside the commission today, she pulled no punches today, dismissing their brief affair of 21 years ago. 'Forget the former lover stuff - everybody makes mistakes and has a charity shag along the way,' she said. Scroll down for video . 'Forget the lover stuff - everybody makes mistakes and has a charity shag along the way' is how Health Services Union boss Kathy Jackson described her affair with barrister Mark Irving . Barrister Mark Irving, representing the Health Services Union, leaves the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption in Sydney. His former lover Kathy Jackson had unsuccessfully attempted to stop him being able to cross-examine her during proceedings . Her affidavit read: 'Over the course of the next six to eight weeks I would go back to his place after Friday night drinks and we would have sex. I recall he lived near the cemetery and had a barber’s chair in his lounge'. Ms Jackson went further today, describing the investigation into her alleged misuse of union members' funds as being the equivalent of 'judicial gang rape'. She also insisted that she wouldn't try to expose union corruption again. Ms Jackson finished giving evidence to the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption and used a media conference to make the comparison about the proceedings against her. Ms Jackson said she 'could not believe the audacity' of one-time lover Mark Irving, now the barrister for the Health Services Union, cross-examining her before the commission about her alleged improper use of union funds. Kathy Jackson (left) took aim at union barrister and former lover Mark Irving (right) outside the Royal Commission, describing their affair as little more than 'a charity shag' Ms Jackson said she now understands the community concern about union slush funds like the one she operated as national secretary of the Health Services Union. The commission has investigated Ms Jackson's use of a $280,000 union slush fund known as the National Health Development Association - including a $50,000 withdrawal that was paid to her ex-husband. Ms Jackson called for all unions and union officials to be investigated like she had been. Kathy Jackson says the funds were needed because there are 'vultures' in the ALP circling unions to take them over . Ms Jackson had attempted to stop union barrister Mark Irving (above) from questioning her because she argued in an affidavit that he would be hostile to her due to their six-week affair. Her request was thrown out . 'They should be looked into because I understand now the community concern,' she said. 'But the reason they're there and the reason they were set up not just in my time but before my time is to get around electoral disclosure.' Asked if she was playing along with the game, Ms Jackson said 'of course I was'. 'But it was more than that - I was buying protection for my members,' she said. Ms Jackson said funds were needed to protect the union from 'vultures' in the ALP 'that are circling these unions to take them over'. Yesterday she recalled in the affidavit that: 'after about eight months, in or about, late 1992 or early 1993 Mr Irving and I had a few too many drinks and went back to his place where we had a sexual relationship'. 'I was at the time married to my first husband, which he knew.' Ms Jackson has been excused from the commission. The commission will continue next week with investigation of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union.","'Forget the lover stuff', he was just 'a charity shag'

"By . Jacinta Taylor For The Mail On Sunday . Tony Marsden, 23, from Whitley Bay, admitted inciting a child to commit a sexual act when he appeared at Newcastle Crown Court in June . A trainee teacher who was spared jail despite bombarding a 13-year-old girl with sexually explicit messages could now face prison after the victim’s mother appealed against the leniency of his sentence. Tony Marsden admitted inciting a child to commit a sexual act when he appeared at Newcastle Crown Court in June. The judge slashed a third off a mandatory two-year custodial sentence and suspended the remainder for two years. The court heard that  Marsden, 23, from Whitley Bay, became ‘infatuated’ with the  girl last year. The Mail on Sunday has seen the sickening catalogue of messages with which he tried to lure the impressionable teenager. While he was able to walk free from court, his once happy and outgoing victim has been left  too traumatised to leave the house unaccompanied. The girl’s mother later asked the Attorney General to look at the case again on the grounds of an unduly lenient sentence. It has now been referred to the Court of Appeal for review by three judges. She said: ‘My daughter’s life has been turned upside down. I have been determined to fight to get justice for her.’ She told how she printed around 24,000 Facebook messages – mostly written by Marsden – to show to the NSPCC and police.

"By . Freya Noble . A German backpacker who got lost in the Australian outback survived for nearly a month by eating flies and insects. Daniel Dudzisz was attempting an epic 2,485 mile (4,000km) journey on foot from New South Wales to Uluru via Queensland. But the 26-year-old became stranded between Windorah and Jundah in central-west Queensland after being cut off by floodwaters. Scroll down for video . Rescued: Daniel Dudzisz, has been found after becoming stranded in the Queensland outback . He was finally found near Coopers Creek by two men yesterday afternoon. Police Inspector Mark Henderson told the ABC Mr Dudzisz became lost and was stranded in bushland for about 10 days between two flooded sections of the Barcoo River. 'If you hadn't heard it with your own ears, not that I have but my officers have, they said they certainly wouldn't have believed it,' he said. 'He joked about never going hungry in the Australian outback because of the amount of flies you can eat for their protein apparently. 'He had some baked beans and cereal when he left Windorah and exhausted that pretty quickly, and said he'd been eating flies ever since.' Mr Dudzisz described his travel method as 'quite hardcore' in an interview with the Warrego Watchman in early February. However, he was certain he could handle it, after being homeless for two years. The plan: Mr Dudzisz started his journey in NSW, was found in Windorah QLD and said he will make it on foot to Uluru. 'What I enjoy about the walking most is just how much closer nature feels when you cross and experience it like this,' he told the publication. 'And all the little unexpected encounters and adventures that tend to accumulate along such a journey.' However police believe the man, who is diabetic, was under-prepared for his expedition and were concerned about his insulin medication not being properly stored. When talking to the ABC, Inspector Henderson said Mr Dudzisz remains determined to continue his mission and has agreed to keep to main roads. 'He understands the risks and is disappointed and regretful that we had been looking for him and caused people to be looking for him.'","German backpacker stayed alive in the Australian outback eating flies .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A cataclysmic meteor impact in Canada that is linked to the death of many animals, including the woolly mammoth, may have also been the catalyst that triggered the start of civilisation as we know it, claims new research. Evidence suggests a meteor struck Quebec around 12,900 years ago and scientists believe this impact caused the Earth's climate to become colder and drier - known as the Younger Dryas period. These freezes and droughts led to some larger animals dying out which in turn forced humans to change their diet and develop agricultural methods to cultivate cereal, for example. Evidence suggests a meteor struck Quebec around 12,900 years ago and scientists now think this impact caused the Earth's climate to become colder and drier - known as the Younger Dryas period. Previous theories thought the change was caused by an ice dam rupture releasing huge amounts of freshwater into the Atlantic . The Younger Dryas period is also known as the Big Freeze. It was a period of cold climatic conditions . and drought that took place between 12,800 and 11,500 . years ago. Scientists from New Hampshire believe this change in climate was caused by an meteor impact, but another theory is that it was because of the collapse of the North American ice sheets. During the period, forests in Scandinavia were replaced with a glacial tundra. There was more dust in the atmosphere that originated from deserts in Asia. The drier conditions caused drought in the Levant, known as the region of Syria or the Eastern Mediterranean, which led inhabitants to agriculture. The change in climate is especially linked to the development of cereal cultivation. Fragments of rock from the meteor are also thought to have released toxic gas which poisoned the air and blacked out the sun, causing temperatures to plummet, plants to die and landscapes to alter forever. In North America particularly, big animals including mastodons, camels, giant ground sloths and sabre-toothed cats all died out. The meteor strike is also thought to have caused the demise of the Woolly mammoth. Human hunters turned to a subsistence diet of roots, berries and smaller game to survive. Meanwhile thousands of miles away in the eastern Mediterranean, the first farmers started growing cereals. The scientists claim that this invention of agriculture was a pivotal step in the development of large settled communities and civilisation. Experts agree on the climate change that marked the start of the Younger Dryas period, but are divided about its cause. The new research is said to provide 'conclusive' evidence that the trigger was a meteor impact. Before now, the most popular explanation has been an ice dam rupture releasing huge amounts of freshwater into the Atlantic. This in turn was thought to have shut down ocean currents moving warm tropical water, resulting in colder conditions. The meteor is thought to have struck forests in southern Quebec in Canada, pictured, around 12,900 years ago . Scientists analysed spherules, droplets of solidified molten rock, deposited in Pennsylvania and New Jersey at the start of the Younger Dryas period. They identified geochemical 'fingerprints' exactly matching the profiles of rock found in southern Quebec. Although no 'smoking gun' crater had been found, this was a strong clue that the spherules had been created by the massive temperatures and pressures of a meteor impact in Canada. The findings appear in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Professor Mukul Sharma, one of the study authors from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, US, said: 'The Younger Dryas cooling impacted human history in a profound manner. 'Environmental stresses may also have caused Natufians in the Near East to settle down for the first time and pursue agriculture.' During the Younger Dryas period, also known as the Big Freeze, around 12,800 years ago a change in climate caused many large animals to die out. This forced humans to develop agricultural methods (modern farming pictured) to gather food and is thought to have led to a rise in communities and civilisation .","Evidence suggests a meteor or asteroid struck Quebec 12,900 years ago .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A charity watchdog is examining possible extremist links at the Cardiff mosque where three British jihadis once worshipped, it has been revealed. The Charity Commission launched the probe into the Al Manar centre in the Welsh capital amid 'concerns' that have been raised over the mosque. The body says it is 'engaged' with the Al Manar Centre Trust on the 'regulatory issues in question' - but it declined to expand on what exactly it was looking into. Scroll down for video . The Charity Commission launched the probe into the Al Manar centre, pictured, in the Welsh capital amid 'concerns' that have been raised over the mosque . Earlier this summer two school friends, Nasser Muthana and Reyaad Khan, both of whom are 20 and attended the mosque, appeared in a chilling ISIS recruitment video. Muthana's brother Aseel, 17, is also reported to be in Syria. The news sparked questions over what prompted the trio to join Isis. Formerly a prospective medical student, Nasser Muthana was joined in Syria by his younger brother Aseel, 17, who has since spoken of his willingness to die fighting for ISIS. The Muthana brothers grew up in Cardiff after their father moved there from Yemen as a teenager. In June, their father Ahmed Muthana, 57, said if his sons ever return to the UK, he would like to see them jailed. Their friend Reyaad Khan, 20, also from Cardiff, said has said he had 'fireworks' for the U.S. if they returned to fight in Iraq. A Charity Commission spokesman told MailOnline: 'We’re aware of concerns raised about the Al Manar Centre Trust in the media. Friends: Reyaad Khan (left), who is also from Cardiff, appeared alongside Muthana (right) in the ISIS propaganda video, urging other young Muslims in the West to join them in jihad . 'We have engaged with the charity on the regulatory issues in question. As this is an ongoing case, we cannot comment further at this time. Please note we are not formally investigating the charity.' Earlier this month it was reported that Prime Minister David Cameron said he would look into how the young men were able to obtain passports and travel to Syria to fight for Islamic state. They are among as many as 600 Britons believed to have joined forces fighting President Bashar Assad in the last three years. MailOnline has made attempts to contact the Al Manar Centre Trust today. A statement posted on the centre's website earlier this summer insisted it rejected extremism and condemned 'those who have recruited these young and impressionable individuals with false promises and a twisted version of Islam.' Nasser Muthana's brother Aseel (pictured), 17, is also reported to be in Syria . The statement said: 'It is worth mentioning that ACT's stance is well known; that we are opposed to going to Syria or any other country, to participate in an armed struggle and have always made this clear. 'We would like to emphasise that the vast majority of the local Muslim community, are law abiding British citizens.' In July, the centre told the Guardian that it denied having anything to do with the radicalisation of the three young men - and that they could have been inspired by images in the media. The centre also denied visiting preachers may have encouraged the men to head to Syria. A statement added that it had been liaising with South Wales police and the Muthana brothers' father.","Charity Commission confirms it is liaising with Al Manar Centre in Cardiff .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Andrew Ross has been jailed for 11 and a half years after carrying out two armed robberies . A former soldier who carried out two terrifying armed robberies and a blackmail plot was caught after holding captive a detective disguised as a pizza delivery boy. Ex-boxer and press-up world record holder Andrew Ross went on a shocking spree of serious crimes after falling on hard times. Using an inside man at a North Shields hotel, balaclava-clad Ross burst in brandishing a knife and demanded that staff fill his bag with cash from the safe. Ross shut two workers - including night shift manager Carl Riley, who was in on the plan - in a cupboard as he fled with more than £6,000. He then held up a post office in South Tyneside, pointing a gun at a customer as terrified staff lay on the ground in fear for their lives. A court heard Ross also blackmailed car garage businessmen in Sunderland, damaging vehicles when they refused to play ball with the crook's protection racket. The 31-year-old former Nissan worker also falsely imprisoned an undercover police officer disguised as a pizza delivery boy during a police sting to arrest him for the blackmail. Ross pleaded guilty to two robberies, attempted robbery, possessing an imitation firearm, blackmail, false imprisonment and affray. He was jailed for 11 and a half years. Judge Penny Moreland told the ex-soldier, who once took part in a hostage rescue in Sierra Leone: 'You have qualities and potential for good and it is a great shame for a man who has potential for good to be being sentenced for offences such as this.' The pre-planned robbery at the Village Hotel, at Silverlink, North Shields, took place on October 16, 2012. The Village Hotel in North Shields, which Ross robbed with the help of an inside man, Carl Riley . Co-accused Riley was night shift manager at the hotel and made sure he was on reception around 2am when Ross was due to come in, before wedging the front door open for him. Armed with a knife, wearing a balaclava and carrying a holdall, Ross came in and started demanding cash from Riley and another member of staff on reception, who he threatened with the blade. Prosecutor Jolyon Perks told Newcastle Crown Court: 'Ross shut Riley and the other man in the cupboard, telling them to stay inside for at least 10 minutes. 'Eventually the other man kicked the cupboard door open and phoned the police. He was fearful he or Riley would be stabbed.' Ross fled with £6,431 from the hotel safe and sped off in a Vauxhall Astra, with the help of two other men - named Daniel Walton and Mark Wright. Riley pretended to police he was a genuine victim of the raid but phone records showed all four had been in touch in the lead-up to the heist. Seven months later Ross, on police bail for the first raid, carried out a second robbery at Whitburn Post Office, in South Tyneside. Again wearing a black balaclava, he burst in around 11.30am on May 24 last year, this time armed with a black handgun. Newcastle Crown Court, where Ross was jailed after pleading guilty to all charges made against him . Customer Stephen Reid, a former soldier, said the weapon looked like a Beretta, but he couldn't tell if it was real or a fake. Mr Perks told the court: 'Ross approached the counter and shouted: ""Give me the money"". 'Both women dropped to the floor and one of them crawled along the floor to the kitchen from where she contacted police. 'Ross pointed the handgun at Mr Reid, who stepped back against the wall with his arms raised. 'Ross moved towards the counter and kicked the counter door with full force but it held secure so he then turned back to Mr Reid, again pointing the gun at him, shouting: ""Give me the f***ing phone"".' Having stolen the phone, Ross fled, screeching away in his getaway car outside. He was arrested around a week later and police found texts on his phone referring to the robbery. However he was still on bail in January this year, when he started blackmailing two Sunderland business partners, damaging cars when they refused to bow to his demands that they pay him for protection. Ross smashed the porch window at the home of one of the men and left a brick on the bonnet of the other's car as a warning. Police were called and recorded a phone conversation between one of the men and Ross. A surveillance operation was set up.as a result. On January 30 a detective was sent to Ross' home dressed as a pizza delivery boy in order to gain access to the block of flats covertly. But as the undercover officer went into the block, Ross was coincidentally on his way out and became suspicious. He went back to his flat, armed himself with a knife and returned to confront the officer, who was waiting for firearms back-up to arrive. Mr Perks said: 'Despite yelling at him to get out, the defendant then deliberately trapped the officer in the lobby with him by locking the front door and standing between him and the exit. 'He then produced the knife from his waistband and brandished it at the officer. The officer pressed his radio panic alarm and at that point identified himself as a police officer.' Ross then ran back to his flat and climbed out of a window onto the roof. After a period of negotiation and him trying to smash his phone to hide evidence, he was arrested. Ross, of Aidan House, Sunderland, had a previous conviction for possessing a firearm in 2005, for which he was jailed for five years. Riley, 24, of Gregory Road, Sunderland, pleaded guilty to robbery and was jailed for three years and nine months. Walton, 24, of Milton Street, South Shields and Wright, of Stafford Grove, Sunderland, admitted theft and both got an 18 month suspended sentence with 200 hours unpaid work. David Roberts, 21, of Raby Street, Sunderland, admitted handling stolen goods after selling Mr Reid's phone online. He got a community order with 100 hours of unpaid work.","Andrew Ross was jailed for 11 and a half years at Newcastle Crown Court .

Staff at the £30 million Proton Therapy Centre in Prague are due to meet tomorrow to finalise plans for Ashya’s treatment. It is understood he will first undergo chemotherapy at the city’s Motol University Hospital before being moved to the private clinic five miles away. His treatment could cost around £60,000. Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz, the family’s lawyer, said yesterday: ‘Finally the English authorities are allowing Ashya to travel to Prague. ‘There are two options. One is a private plane, which has already been costed, and which would take Ashya straight to Prague with all the appropriate medical facilities, including doctors and nurses who would look after him. ‘The other and the preferred option is a plane provided by the hospital in Prague.’ He added: ‘Ashya is laughing which is the most important thing. He’s fit to travel and very happy, and playing with toys and with his mum, dad and brother. Ashya was reunited with parents at a Malaga hospital.  It is understood he will first undergo chemotherapy at the city's Motol University Hospital before being moved to the private clinic five miles away . ‘His parents think this treatment is going to be less aggressive for his future and is going to have less negative repercussions in terms of his future intellectual development and his quality of life. ‘We all want the best for him. We want this treatment to work because that’s what his parents have fought for. Like any parent would, they’ve just tried to do the best for their child.’ However, Dr Peter Wilson, lead paediatrician at Southampton General Hospital, has insisted that Ashya’s best chance of survival is conventional radiotherapy. Dr Wilson, who cared for Ashya in Britain, said the boy’s form of  cancer – called medulloblastoma – was not suitable for proton beam therapy because radiation was needed over a much wider area to kill all the cancerous cells. Ashya's parents think the pioneering treatment is going to be less aggressive than traditional chemotherapy. Above, Ashya's father Brett and brother Danny wait outside the children's hospital in Malaga on Friday . ‘For this particular tumour, the reason why the proton beam was  not deemed to be of any benefit is because you have to irradiate most of the brain and spine,’  he added. Southampton Hospital staff and Hampshire Police have faced heavy criticism at the way Ashya’s disappearance was handled, with Mr King, 51, saying he and his wife were ‘treated like terrorists’. An inquiry has been launched by the local safeguarding children board. A spokesman for the Proton Therapy Centre said last night: ‘We have received the documents and a decision will be made on the boy’s treatment at a meeting of doctors on Monday morning.’ Staff at the £30million Proton Therapy Centre in Prague are due to meet tomorrow to finalise plans for Ashya's treatment, which could cost around £60,000 .

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . Police are  behind in the search for a 23-year-old woman who wasn't reported missing until four days after her disappearance. Christina Morris, 23, of Plano, Texas, was last seen on August 30, walking with a male friend into a mall shopping garage, but she never drove out. She wasn't reported missing though until September 3, when she failed to show up to work and her boss got worried. Missing: Christina Morris, 23, went missing last Saturday after attending a party at a friend's house. She was last seen walking into a parking garage at 4am that day. On the left is the last picture taken of her . Morris lives with her boyfriend, who failed to report her missing, her parents Ronnie and Jonnie McElroy said. Police are now enlisting the public's help in the search, after releasing surveillance footage showing her entering The Shops at Legacy parking garage around 4am Saturday with a male friend. She had been hanging out at a friend's house just previously. Piece of the puzzle: Police released this surveillance footage showing her entering a parking garage with a close male friend around 4am Saturday. She was not recorded leaving the garage . Scene: Above, the Shops at Legacy, where Morris was last seen with her close friend. The male friend she was walking with is not considered a suspect in her disappearance . Morris lives with her boyfriend, but he didn't report her missing until four days later when she didn't show up for work and her boss called. Morris pictured left in a picture with an unidentified man, posted to her Facebook . The close friend she was seen walking with has been questioned and police do not consider him a suspect in the disappearance. 'He goes to the right to his car. He gets in his car and he leaves,' Officer David Tilley, a Plano Police spokesperson, told CBS Dallas/Fort Worth. 'She went the other way. From there, we don’t really know what happened.' Morris' bank accounts have not been accessed and her cell phone is turned off or dead. The last 15 calls were to her boyfriend. And police say there was no sign of foul play or a struggle near her car. This week, her parents organized a search of the area around the shopping mall, but it turned up no new evidence. 'We can’t sleep,' Mrs McElroy said. 'I have two different visions… in one vision I see her smile, I feel her touch. And I also vision the worst. And I don’t like that at all.'

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . Cheryl Burnside, 30, posed as a stripogram to gain entry to a block of flats in Halifax, West Yorkshire, before forcing a 71-year-old man to hand over money . A con artist who tricked her way into a vulnerable pensioner's home by posing as a stripogram before forcing him to hand over cash after stripping down to her bra and knickers has been jailed. Cheryl Burnside, 30, conned her way into a block of flats in Halifax, West Yorkshire, by claiming to be a stripogram for a 'Mr Johnson'. However, when she gained entry to the complex she persuaded a 71-year-old man to let her into his home so she could use the toilet. Burnside, who was addicted to drink and drugs for several years, took off her dress as she told her victim that she had been booked as a stripogram for £70. Prosecutor John Topham told Bradford Crown Court on Thursday that she was wearing only a bra and a thong when the man offered to give her £20 just to leave. However, Burnside said she wanted more money and then pretended to make a phone call to her boyfriend suggesting that he should come to the flat because the man was refusing to pay up. Before leaving the flat she grabbed a pair of trousers which contained a few pounds and the man's keys, but she was later linked to the crime after leaving her fingerprints on a cigarette packet. The court heard that she committed the offence just days after being given a community sentence for shoplifting. Mr Topham told the court how four months earlier Burnside had targeted another pensioner, in his 80s, who had previously helped her out with money. She turned up at his Halifax home just after midnight and when he refused to give her any money she took his wallet with £60 in it. The court heard that Burnside denied being involved in that offence in February and was on bail when she stole the second man's property in June. Bradford Crown Court heard how it was the second time Burnside had targeted a pensioner for cash and the judge jailed her for three years for the 'despicable' crimes after she pleaded guilty to two charges of theft . She was originally charged with two offences of burglary, but when her case was listed for trial last month she pleaded guilty to two charges of theft. Her guilty pleas spared the two pensioners from having to give evidence in court. Judge Jonathan Rose described the crimes as 'despicable' and said Burnside had targeted her victims because of their age. He jailed her for three years and imposed an indefinite restraining order banning her from contacting her first victim.","Cheryl Burnside tricked her way into flat complex by posing as stripogram .

"By . Zoe Szathmary for MailOnline . and MailOnline Reporter . Wayne Newton's palatial Las Vegas residence can be yours for $30million. Yahoo! Homes reported the sticker price is $40million less than what was being asked last year. Realtor Dale Thornburgh told the website the much lower price is a 'considerable loss.' Yahoo! Homes reported that Newton's business partner Lacy Harber 'apparently intended to work with Newton and his wife to establish a sort of Graceland West where the couple and their young daughter would continue to live.' Star: Wayne Newton is seen in this 2010 file photo. His former residence is being listed for $30million . However, the Newtons moved out last year and despite the fact that Harber renovated the property, no one bought it, according to Yahoo! Homes. Redfin reported that Newton lost the property in bankruptcy to CSD LLC, which was headed by  Lacy and Dorothy Harber. Newton dominated the Las Vegas show scene in his prime as a singer and entertainer, delivering such hits as Danke Schoen which was famously used as the soundtrack for the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. In flusher days, Redfin reported the crooner's Casa de Shenandoah property featured flamingos, South African penguins and Arabian horses. Newton along with his family and menagerie moved to a downsized Las Vegas estate, the website revealed. Redfin noted that the estate comes complete with an actual jumbo jet and a terminal - to see the luxurious beast take off and land - as well as an actual 'car museum' for good measure. Luxury: The estate - which Newton lost in bankruptcy to CSD LLC - has the nickname Casa de Shenandoah . Tropical: Lagoon style swimming pools with rocky waterfalls are a prominent feature on the desert estate . Equestrian paradise: The sprawling property boasts 37 stables for horses on site . There are 37 horse stables, an equestrian pool and countless arenas for riding, making it an equine paradise if there ever was one. But horses were not Newton's only fascination, as Redfin explains. The property has also been home to countless other animals that the renowned entertainer brought home to play and stay, including a plethora of exotic ones. Menagerie: Charlie the penguin, seen in 2010, once lived on Wayne Newton's estate . Lawns for days: Lakes and sprawling greenery used to house a range of exotic animals back when Newton was the owner of the 40 acre property in Las Vegas . Back in the day: Flamingos, South African penguins and Arabian horses used to trot about the estate . Fly on over for a visit! The estate even has a jumbo jet terminal for friends to land in . Sprawling swimming pools shaped like tropical lagoons and decorated with waterfalls and rock formations provide ample space for splashing about and escaping the Nevada heat. Newton's career in entertainment was topped off with an appearance on Dancing With The Stars in 2007, during which the singer partnered up with Cheryl Burke. The Vegas superstar, who is married to attorney Kathleen McCrone, continues to tour worldwide with his music. The couple have one daughter, Lauren, and Newton has another adopted daughter from his previous marriage to Elaine Okamura. Welcome: The front gates of the property give an indication of the luxury inside . Not for humans! The owner can make use of this equestrian pool, designed for horses . Anyone for tennis? A somewhat unkempt tennis court occupies a tiny portion of the property . Plenty of room to sleep: Aside from the main house there are also seven separate smaller houses . Waiting to take off: There is a prime seating area where guests can wait to board their jumbo jets . Added extra: The next lucky owner will need to have a pilot on hand - or learn to be one . Splashing about: The property offers plenty of room to take a dip in its sprawling pools . Desert home: The property would reach soaring temperature heights being in Nevada . Relax: Whoever buys the home can enjoy this living room . Lively: A tree-lined lane lane is pictured in this snap, taken back in 2010, when peacocks were still roaming the yards .","Wayne Newton's palatial Las Vegas residence can be yours for $30million .

"By . Daniel Piotrowski for Daily Mail Australia . They are noble Outback creatures, iconic of the Snowy River. But a pair of Canberra men on a camping trip to Kosciuszko National Park last month were left stunned when they discovered a small band of starving brumbies feeding on another horse's flesh. In the words of witness Dr Don Driscoll, the wild horses 'had turned to cannibalism'. Graphic images below . Scoll down for video . 'Cannibal horses': The campers took this picture of the wild horses feeding on one of their brethren. 'The horses had turned to cannibalism': Another scene from Kosciusko National Park. Noble creatures: Wild horses roam the outback. Ecologists Dr Driscoll and Dr Sam Banks first noticed the dead horse, which had a huge hole in its abdomen, on the way up the hill from Dead Horse Gap, in the national park located between New South Wales and Victoria. It's intestines appeared to have been nibbled out. It wasn't clear what  could have caused the damage. 'I had no idea what could've done that,' ecologist Dr Driscoll, from the Australian National University, told Daily Mail Australia. But the culprits became clear the next day, as the campers headed back down the hill. Three emaciated horses stood near the dead brumby. Two had shoved their snouts inside the fallen creature's abdominal cavity. Dr Driscoll (left) and Dr Banks (right) produced a documentary about the incident. Walking away: The brumbies trotted away from the body after the researchers approached. Grim discovery: The campers discovered the horses eating the body on the way back from Ram's Head towards Dead Horse Gap. The animals were nibbling at the animal's digestive tract, Dr Driscoll told Daily Mail Australia. 'They were biting at what was left of the insides... They were obviously starving.' Horses are herbivores, but Dr Driscoll supposed the horses had been pushed to the edge. He said he witnessed one of the brumbies bite part of the cavity and pull it off. 'It was obvious they were being pushed to eat the entrails of the dead horse...' 'I suppose desperate times call for desperate measures in the horse world.' The wild horses of the Snowy Mountains are 'denizens of the Australian psyche', Dr Driscoll said. In a piece for the academic website The Conversation, the scientists wrote: 'As far as we are aware, this behaviour has never been documented before. 'The noble brumbies of the silver screen have been reduced to starving cannibals in Kosciuszko National Park.' Dr Driscoll said the number of wild horses in Kosciuszko National Park was overwhelming. The population in the Snowy Mountains has ballooned from an estimated 2369 in 2003 to 7679 in 2009. Their numbers were forecast to pass 13,000 in 2012. 'I've never seen an environment so overwhelmed by feral animals,' he said. And while there is a horse management plan in place, which organises for excess animals to be shuttled away to new homes (or sometimes taken to the abbattoir), Dr Driscoll and Dr Banks argued it would be more humane to cull the creatures from helicopters. 'It's really quite tragic, in that the only option to minimise suffering by horses is to shoot them from the air,' he said. 'If you don't shoot them from the air then many more horses are going to suffer and die in the next ten years.' The Park's wild horse management plan is currently up for review.","Campers say the wild horses 'turned to cannibalism'

"By . Mark Duell . A teenage football fan today claimed Sports Direct refused to print a tribute to Hillsborough victims on his Liverpool shirt - in case it caused offence. Nicholas Bieber, 18, of Northampton, wanted to pay tribute to the lives lost in the 1989 disaster by having ‘Justice 96’ on the back of his red jersey. But he was stunned to be told by staff at his local branch of the sports retail giant last Saturday that they could not print this, in case it upset other people. Refused: Nicholas Bieber, 18, of Northampton, wanted to pay tribute to the lives lost in the 1989 disaster by having 'Justice 96' on the back of his red Liverpool shirt . His experience has now caught the eye of ex-Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler, who re-tweeted a message the teenager sent to him about the incident to his 360,000 followers on Twitter. Mr Bieber said: ‘The staff said they couldn’t print it because it might cause offence to other people.  I was shocked and I am very angry. It’s something I want to support and show my affection for. ‘I’m very frustrated. A national sports outlet should employ people with common sense. I don’t think it could offend anyone. There’s a big difference between causing offence and supporting a worthy cause. ‘In light of what has emerged recently there’s not a decent person in Britain that would not want justice for those who lost their lives on that day.’ Huge retail chain: Sports Direct has more than 470 stores in Britain and employs around 19,000 staff . Support: The teenager has even now caught the eye of former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler, 37, who re-tweeted a message the teenager sent to him about the incident to his 360,000 followers on Twitter . He tweeted Fowler, 37, about the incident soon . after it happened, saying: ‘Just got refused by Sports Direct to have . the name & number 'Justice 96' printed on the back of my #LFC shirt! #disgrace’. 'The staff said they couldn’t print it because it might cause offence to other people. I was shocked and I am very angry' Nicholas Bieber . A Sports Direct spokesman was not available to comment on the matter when contacted today. But in 2009 the store ruled only to allow the printing of current football players’ names and numbers on football shirts after a Manchester United fan was sold a shirt mocking the Hillsborough disaster. Sports Direct was forced to issue a public apology about the ‘wholly inappropriate’ jersey after the fan paid £55 for a shirt on which the figure '96' was printed, and below that the slogan ‘Not Enough’. Disaster: The Hillsborough tragedy happened when a crush at an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield in April 1989 resulted in 96 deaths . The company immediately changed its printing policy after the fan posted images of the shirt on Facebook, with the Hillsborough Family Support Group saying the printing of it ‘incited trouble’. 'I’m very frustrated. A national sports outlet should employ people with common sense. I don’t think it could offend anyone' Nicholas Bieber . Sports Direct, a cut-price sports clothing and equipment retailer, has more than 470 stores in Britain, employs around 19,000 staff and was founded by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley. The Hillsborough tragedy was a crush at an FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the stadium in Sheffield in April 1989, which resulted in 96 deaths. An independent panel reported last week, 23 years after the tragedy occurred, that police attempted to blame fans for the disaster and 41 of those who died could have been saved.","Northampton teenager Nicholas Bieber wanted to pay tribute to victims .

"By . Jaya Narain . A mother has spoken out after she was ordered to stop breastfeeding her baby in a public swimming pool. Stephanie Wilby said she felt humiliated when pool staff threatened to throw her out unless she stopped, and believes she should have the right to breastfeed wherever she chooses. The 22-year-old was in the water from her waist down feeding her four-month-old son Leo in the corner of a toddler pool as other children and their parents splashed about. New mother Stephanie Wilby was ordered to stop breastfeeding her four-month-old son Leo in a swimming pool at the Manchester Aquatics Centre after staff claimed feeding her son was 'indecent exposure' and similar to someone urinating in the pool . She said that ‘in a matter of seconds’ a lifeguard approached and told her she would have to stop immediately. When Mrs Wilby, who was in the pool . with husband Alan and 17-month-old daughter Harmonie, asked why, she . claims she was told it was not hygienic. She asked to speak to a manager, but they agreed with the lifeguard and said security would be called if she did not stop. Manchester Council said an investigation has been launched into the incident at the Aquatics Centre, which is run by Serco and the Manchester Sport and Leisure Trust, part of the council. Thousands of readers have had their say on the website and on Twitter about whether Stephanie Wilby should have been breastfeeding little Leo in the pool: . Lily McPhilimey @PixiegirlLily tweeted: 'No breastfeeding #MailOnline I'm all for feeding but even I wouldn't there!' Martin, from Oxford commented: 'I don't see there is a problem. breastfeeding is the most natural thing in the world. I worry about some people I really do.' xcountmeinx, from Hereford, said: 'Not in a swimming pool for heavens sake.'Living life by FISH, from London, commented: 'Fair enough - I can't eat in the swimming pool nor can you little one! But it's not ""indecent""'Linda Malaga, from Malaga in Spain added: 'I agree wholeheartedly with breastfeeding in public provided it is done in a discreet manner and not in full view of everyone. Feeding in a public swimming pool is completely wrong! After all you wouldn't eat your lunch whilst waist deep in a public swimming pool would you????' Kim from North Lincs said: 'Totally disgusting, why should the rest of us and our kids be exposed to her feeding her baby in a pool, there is a time and a place for heavens sake. Sick of breast feeding mums trying to make a point at the expense of the rest if us.' Touchwood, from Falkirk added: 'There's a time and a place; this wasn't the latter.' Sandy Brown, from London, said: 'What is wrong with these women who do this. If you wish to feed your kid, then go somewhere else. Not where people are swimming.'Jeanie, from Devon, commented: 'I'm concerned that she was 'waist deep' in the water, it doesn't seem the safest place for a tiny baby breastfeeding or not. could have been handled better though obviously.'Louby87, from Grimsby, said: 'Certainly not the place for this. She must have known her baby was due for a feed so why get in the pool, she should have waited until after.'Sue, from Sheffield, said: 'She definitely should not do that in a swimming pool really disgusting.' Diamonds are forever, from Hampshire, added: 'Yes he was right !!! There is a time and place for every thing...I wouldn't want to swim in her breast milk...nor if or when her child throws it back up again......Get real its a public bath !!' Mrs Wilby said she was then surrounded by pool staff threatening to throw her out unless she obeyed them. She said one staff member told her . breastfeeding in a pool was akin to a swimmer urinating in the water and . also amounted to ‘indecent exposure’. Bosses at the state-of-the-art . Manchester Aquatics Centre, a training venue for last year’s Olympics . and Paralympics, have apologised about the  incident on Sunday . afternoon. Last night Mrs Wilby, who is on . maternity leave from her customer service job at British Gas, said: ‘I . should be allowed to breastfeed where I want. ‘As long as I do so tactfully and I . am in within the law then I should not be harassed by people  telling me . to stop. I was  humiliated and it was very distressing. ‘But the staff could not tell me under what law or rule I was being told to stop. ‘I even asked about feeding at the . side of the pool but they said that was not allowed and said I should go . to the changing rooms or toilet. ‘They made a real scene. They were . saying me breastfeeding was indecent exposure but I was covered more . than most of the other swimmers. ‘One staff member also said he would . stop a man urinating in the pool and that is why they did not want me . breastfeeding in the water.’ Mrs Wilby from Denton, Manchester, said she had only moved to the side of the toddlers’ pool for a few moments to feed her son. ‘It was just a matter of a few . seconds but the response from staff was dreadful. The manner in which . they treated me was aggressive and upsetting and caused me major . embarrassment. ‘If they did not like it they could have asked me quietly to stop,’ she added. ‘I would have still questioned their reasons but it would not have been as inappropriate.’ Mrs Wilby, whose husband also works . in customer  service, added: ‘This was the worst possible customer . service I have ever come across.’ The family have made an official complaint. The aquatics centre, one of the . largest in the country, is run by Serco and Manchester Sport and Leisure . Trust, part of Manchester council, which is investigating. The Equality Act 2010 has made it . illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place . such as a cafe, shop or public transport. It is not against the law to . prevent a woman breastfeeding where there are legitimate health and . safety risks. Although restaurants and cafes . generally do not have separate breastfeeding areas, some store chains . such as Tesco and Boots do provide dedicated areas away from women’s . toilets. Other businesses have begun displaying stickers on windows telling mothers that breastfeeding is welcome on the premises. Councillor Rosa Battle, executive . member for culture and leisure at Manchester council, said: ‘We keenly . encourage new mothers to use our leisure facilities and they have every . right to breastfeed their babies when they need to do so, in line with . existing legislation. 'We have also asked that the Trust and Serco review their existing policies, to make sure that they reflect the law. ‘As a breastfeeding mother myself, I . expect staff contracted to work in our leisure facilities to understand . and respect women’s right to breastfeed in public places.’ A spokesman for Serco said: ‘We are fully supportive of mothers breastfeeding their child whilst in our centres. ‘Serco’s operating practices are to . encourage breastfeeding in a safe and comfortable environment for both . the mother and child rather than it taking place in the swimming pool. ‘We will fully investigate this . matter and where appropriate we will amend our policies and put in place . appropriate training for staff. ‘We apologise for any inconvenience that was caused.’ Tara Powell was asked to stop breastfeeding her son Preston at the Jobcentre in Bromley . The Mail Online revealed last Wednesday a mother of five burst into tears after she said she was kicked out of a Jobcentre for breastfeeding her baby. Tara Powell had taken her four-month-old son Preston with her to an appointment at the centre in Bromley, south-east London, where she was meeting to discuss her income support money. Miss Powell, of Orpington, said the interviewer then told her she felt 'uncomfortable'. But the mother replied: 'There's nothing uncomfortable about me breastfeeding my son, it's natural.' However the interviewer was said to have told her the breastfeeding was 'disgusting', adding: 'If you do not stop it, I'm terminating this interview'. Mrs Powell added: 'She was raising her voice then she kicked me out and ended the interview. 'I was crying because she did that to me.She kicked me out for breastfeeding my son. I have never ever felt so embarrassed.' Miss Powell said a manager apologised following the incident, and told her the appointment would have to be rebooked. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said Miss Powell was offered a private place to feed her baby after the meeting was ended, adding that the incident was being investigated. She said: 'We have apologised to Ms Powell for any inconvenience and confusion caused during her visit to the Jobcentre. 'Mothers are welcome to feed their babies when visiting us. This can take place wherever the mother feels comfortable - either in a public area or a private room if one is available.' A spokesman for We Do It In Public, a campaign group supporting breastfeeding in public, said: 'Perceptions of breastfeeding in public still continues to be a sticking point for both new and experienced mums who choose to breastfeed. 'It's such a shame that as a society we are still seeing cases where people are asked to leave public places, just because they are feeding their baby.'","Stephanie Wilby was feeding four-month-old Leo in the toddler pool .

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . Not even dying in an alley way and being brought back to life at least twice by paramedics stopped former ice junkie Jack Nagle from doing anything to get his next hit. ‘I was with these people taking a whole bunch of drugs then they just left me there,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'The second I discharged myself from hospital I went and used straight away.' Jack's spiral into drug addiction began with marijuana when he was about 14 before he started using harder drugs by the age of 17. But the moment he smoked ice for the first time in a car in his home town of Melbourne he was hooked and his life transcended into a drug-fuelled haze of smoking and injecting as much crystal methamphetamine as the then 19 year-old could get his hands on. Scroll down for video . Jack Nagle says he was hooked from the very first time he smoked ice in a car in Melbourne four years ago . Now 23, Jack said he quickly descended from a happy-go-lucky, kind-hearted and cheeky kid into a manipulative, deceitful, cowardly, unstable and pathetic person. As a teen, he was a talented and 'incredibly fit' basketballer who went over to America for a month to try out for basketball scholarships. But Jack's life could not have ended up taking more of an unexpected turn. The Truman Show is simply an entertaining movie for most people but for Jack, he had the starring role. ‘The last six months I was completely nuts and in a constant psychosis – highly paranoid about everything and delusional,’ he said. ‘Then it started to get to the point when I thought everyone around me was a paid actor looking into my life.’ ‘It was so extreme near the end that I would black out and be in such a psychotic state that I would think I was flying to Thailand but just be sitting on the sofa, then within that I would have moments of clarity which was really strange.' Jack quickly descended from a happy-go-lucky, kind-hearted and cheeky kid into a manipulative, deceitful, cowardly, unstable and pathetic person . He believed everyone around him were paid actors looking into his life just like in the movie The Truman Show . Jack is saddened by other ice addicts, such as Harriet Wran (pictured) who has been charged with murder, who didn't get out before it was too late . For at least six months, Jack was desperate to get clean but he couldn't beat his addiction. ‘I would get home every night and say to myself ""I can’t do this anymore"" and then as soon as I woke up in the morning I would just use again,' he said. 'I was just stuck. It was almost like I was looking at myself from the outside but just couldn’t stop - I was in the grips of obsession and compulsion. ‘As much as I would take my mind away about not thinking about using I would go back there – it wasn’t a case of wanting to do it – it was more of a case of having to.’ It wasn’t until 12 months later when Jack stole $7,500 and went on a week-long bender that he had the profound moment of taking a good look at himself in the mirror. ‘I stayed up for over a week and a half and just lost my mind completely so when I came out of all of that I went and knocked on my mum’s door and asked for help,’ he said. ‘It sounds cliché but my life flashed before my eyes – I was a young fit happy basketballer and had turned into a stereotypical junkie.’ It wasn't until 12 months later when Jack stole $7,500 and went on a week-long bender that he had the profound moment of taking a good look at himself in the mirror . He had  stayed up for over a week and a half before knocking on his mum's door and asking for help . After a very challenging and tumultuous 12 months in rehabilitation, Jack has been clean for the past three years and has no doubt in his mind where he would have ended up if he didn’t turn up on his mother’s doorstep that day. ‘Jails, institutions or death basically – the bitter end – any of those three,’ he said. Now a manager of a rehab clinic, Jack looks at media reports of other ice junkies, such as the former NSW premier’s daughter Harriet Wran, who has been charged with murder, who didn’t get out in time and thinks of what could have been. ‘I feel grateful and lucky that I got the right help and my self-esteem is back,’ he said. ‘To look at me you would never know – I’ve had a complete attitude shift.’ The support he received while recovering has led him to work as a manager at DayHab - Addiction Treatment Centre Melbourne for the past year. ‘It’s quite hard and stressful but it’s awesome – I love it’ he said. ‘I can help because I know what they are going through.’ However, Jack was not delusional about how easy it was to relapse with addictions - particularly ice. ‘Look I’ll be honest it’s always on the cards,’ he admitted. ‘Just because you stop doesn’t mean you beat it, basically.' ‘There is this saying once you stop - your addiction is doing push-ups in the background in the car park,’ he said. ‘So even if you’re not using, it progresses, so if I was to go and pick up again I would probably be straight back to where I was before in a matter of weeks, and probably worse.’ If you or anyone you know needs help with substance abuse contact Dayhab: www.dayhab.com.au or phone 1800 329 422. Jack believes he would be either dead, in jail or in a psych ward if he had not sought help for his addiction .","Jack Nagle was 19 when he first smoked ice in a car four years ago .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . An X Factor hopeful who wowed judges last night has told of her heartache after her step-brother drowned in a filthy swimming pool days after her audition. Youth worker Monica Michael, 24, is struggling to cope with the death of Savvakis Georgiou, 18, who slipped and fell into a hotel pool in the Cypriot party town of Ayia Napa. The promising footballer is reported to have been remained unseen at the bottom of the Kalypso Hotel pool for 20 minutes because the water was filled with condoms, syringes and cigarette butts. Scroll down for video . Monica Michael told of her devastation at losing her step-brother just days after her X Factor audition . The singer is seen here with her step-brother Savvakis Georgiou who drowned in a hotel pool in Aiya Napa . Ms Michael, from London, said: 'It's hard to believe that he was at my audition and now he is no longer here. 'Sav was a huge, huge fan of The X factor and he always wanted to see the show and how it was run and I was happy that he got to witness my audition before he died. 'It was really hard to watch the show on Saturday without him and I just hope that he is at peace in heaven.' The singer said that her stepbrother had been on a boys' holiday to celebrate his recent signing to League Two football club Stevenage FC when he drowned in the pool on August 18. Ms Michael wowed the judges last night and said: 'Sav was a huge, huge fan of The X factor' The singer said that Savvakis Georgiou, 18, (left) had been on a boys' holiday to celebrate his recent signing to League Two football club Stevenage FC when he drowned in the pool . The 18-year-old, from Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, had been partying  through the night but is believed to have slipped and fell into the Kalypso Hotel pool (pictured) in the early hours of August 18 . Despite there being more than 20 people in the swimming pool, it has been claimed nobody spotted he was in trouble until a female swimmer tripped over his body at the bottom of the pool. 'It was full of condoms, syringes and cigarette butts and nobody could see his body at the bottom because it was so dirty,' said Ms Michael. 'If it was not for the fact that it was so filthy, maybe someone could have seen him sooner and saved his life. 'It is so devastating and sad that he drowned in an algae-ridden hotel swimming pool.' Several people tried to revive the teen, but he was pronounced dead at Famagusta Hospital with a post mortem confirming that he had drowned in the early hours of August 18. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini wiped away a tear as she was reminded of her own sister by a touching tribute song . The teen, from Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, had travelled to Ayia Napa with his cousin on August 17 after visiting his grandparents for four days in nearby Protaras. On last night's show, Ms Michael performed a song she wrote for her sister Natalie, 16, called Pretty Little Sister. She told the judges she wrote the song as a cautionary tale after she had rebelled and gone off the rails but had been saved by music. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini was moved by her performance and said she was reminded of a time when her own sister would write poems to her. She said: 'It really touched me because my sister writes me poems and she has since I was little and so I completely related to that song.' The signer received four unanimous Yes votes from the panel. The signer's 16-year-old sister looked on in awe as she left the room in silence with her performance . Her family celebrated with Ms Michael and said they were very proud of her performance .","Singer Monica Michael, 24, told of heartache at losing her step-brother .

"By . Christopher Wilson for Mail on Sunday . 'It's no big deal': Nigel Farage,  standing for next year's Parliament on a no-unskilled-foreigners ticket, has never revealed his German ancestry . The voters of South Thanet will decide whether Nigel Farage becomes a force in Westminster politics  or remains on the periphery. Yet, despite a host of interviews over the past decade and a supposedly tell-all autobiography, Nigel Farage has yet to give them a full account of himself. For while it is well known that Mr Farage’s wife Kirsten is German, the Ukip leader – standing for next year’s Parliament on a no-unskilled-foreigners ticket – is yet to admit in public that he himself is the descendant of immigrants. Today, a Mail on Sunday investigation can reveal that Mr Farage’s grandmother, born Gladys Schrod, descends from German immigrants who fled to Britain in search of work and a better way of life. It’s a secret he has kept close to his chest ever since his election to Ukip’s leadership in 2006. In the many interviews the party leader has given in the past decade, he has never referred to his German ancestry. Neither do his ancestors rate a mention in his self-congratulatory memoirs Flying Free. Indeed, in the book he refers to his grandmother Gladys Schrod as having ‘Georgette Heyer-style aspirations’, apparently all very English, all very decorous. But in their three-bed semi in Beckenham, Kent, Gladys’s father and Mr Farage’s great-grandfather, Carl Schrod, a lowly Post Office sorter, is unlikely to have encouraged the upper-crust tales dispensed by Miss Heyer. He’d grown up the hard way, living in rented rooms in the German quarter of  London behind Tottenham Court Road – an area awash with refugees and prostitutes. Last year, in a confrontation with BBC political editor Nick Robinson, Mr Farage had the opportunity to set the record straight. Robinson drew attention to the fact that the politician’s second wife, Kirsten, was born in Hamburg. Why, Robinson asked, did Mr Farage give the job of secretary to a German when it could have gone to a Brit? Mr Farage insisted that ‘nobody else could do that job’, which included checking emails for him at midnight. He might have added: ‘Germans are very hard-working, as I should know – my people come from Frankfurt.’ But he did not. So today, we supply the missing piece of the jigsaw which makes up the Nigel Farage story – the German connection. During the middle part of the 19th Century, emigration was a popular option among those who lived in the federation of German states (Germany did not become a country until 1871). Religious persecution, a sharp economic downturn and rising land prices were driving Germans from their homeland. Scroll down for video . Crowded: Immigrants fight for space in a rundown area of London in the late 19th Century. What Nikolaus Schrod would have made of his great-great-grandson's 'keep them out' rallying cry, one can only guess . Millions went to America, while others saw their future here. Nikolaus Schrod, Mr Farage’s great-great grandfather, was a young cabinet-maker in Frankfurt. He married his sweetheart Bina at 21, but before starting a family he decided his shaky prospects would be much improved by moving to England. It was the 1850s, a time of rapid expansion and a new prosperity fuelled by the Industrial Revolution. Britain, then as now, was the land of promise. However, the benefits system had not been invented and those who fled to these shores came in the hope of a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay. Panikos Panayi, professor of European History at De Montfort University and a leading expert on German migration, points to the large number of German musicians who’d recently moved to London, bringing with them a wider appreciation of classical music and encouraging a broader culture among the educated classes. Their presence added a new zest to the capital’s cultural life. Close ties: Kristen Farage (pictured), the Ukip leader's second wife, was born in Hamburg . Nikolaus Schrod made the cases  for the pianos, upright and grand, which were becoming a must-have status symbol in every fashionable drawing-room, while Bina brought in  extra money as a needlewoman and dressmaker. They lived in rented rooms in the teeming tenements close to the city’s heart – close enough to the rich who employed them, but a world away. Existing on a minimum wage and living in near-poverty, both were skilled workers making a positive contribution to the life and comfort of the social classes above them. ‘The British Government of the day was operating what was effectively an open-door policy on immigrants,’ says Prof Panayi. ‘And though many Germans who came to London in  the mid-19th Century were largely ignored, these people [the Schrods] were skilled and will have been more positively received.’ What Nikolaus Schrod would have made of his great-great-grandson’s ‘keep them out’ rallying cry, one can only guess. After all, he and Bina came to Britain with no paper qualifications – in Nigel Farage’s future Britain, they would be turned away. Yet in his short life – he died before his 45th birthday – Nikolaus was a model of what foreign labour can do to add to the wealth of the nation. He was no Roma camping on the streets but a man who worked so hard to make a new life for his family it sent him to an early grave. His only child, Carl, left school at 14 to become a telegraph messenger with the General Post Office. Carl later changed his name to Charles and married an English girl, Ellen Abbott. The Anglicisation of the family was completed in the next generation when their daughter Gladys married a young stockbroker’s clerk, Harry Farage. It would appear, the family was always determined to improve itself – never  asking for help, never expecting it. Harry was the first white-collar worker in what was to become a relatively posh family. By the next generation the Farages had found out how to make money in the City and went about it with gusto. Both sides of the family – Schrods and Farages – are a proud illustration of how a flexible labour market can reward both the labourer and the country as a whole. But Nigel Farage seems determined to deny the past in his juggernaut journey to fame. In May at the launch of the Euro election campaign in Yorkshire, he derided the ‘mass’ of people ‘coming in and flooding the lower ends of the labour market in Britain’ – doing, in fact, what his ancestors the Schrods had done. And – come to that – the Farages had done too. The surname Farage, according to its owner, is of Huguenot origin. The Huguenots were members of the protestant church in France who fled in their tens of thousands from religious persecution. As many as 500,000 left the country in the late 16th and early 17th Centuries, many of them settling in Britain. As with the Schrods, the Farages found no border controls, no Government immigration policy, no racial or religious prejudice – nothing, in fact, but a peaceful country which welcomed them and encouraged them to work and make the best of their lives. They did not  need to bring with them sheets of paper  listing their qualifications. When told that The Mail on Sunday planned to publish an article on his  German ancestry, Mr Farage, said: ‘I’ve never made any secret of a variety of  European links of the original derivation of my surname.’ However, he admitted he had failed to mention his German ancestors on his mother’s side, despite being questioned on  a regular basis about his German wife. ‘No, I haven’t,’ he said. ‘There’s no reason why I should, is there? Yes, it is true that  my great-great-grandfather was of  Germanic origin but he didn’t come from Germany. Because when he came to the UK, Germany [as a single state] didn’t even exist.’ He added: ‘On the basis of that, I’m one-32nd German. ‘I have a great-great-grandfather of Germanic origin. This is true. I don’t regard it as a particularly big deal.’","Nigel Farage is standing for election on a no-unskilled foreigners ticket .
He is yet to admit in public that he himself is the descendant of immigrants .
His great-grandfather was born in Frankfurt and moved to England in 1850s .

The headline of an earlier version of this article referred to Mr Farage’s great grandfather. This has now been amended to indicate it is his great-great grandfather.

Sonny Khetkan (right) says Harriet Wran (left) relapsed after partying with him on his birthday on July 10 . Khetkan said he was planning to visit Wran in Silverwater women’s prison, who he claims to have met in 2011 while selling drugs to her friends in Bondi. He told the friend that one thing led to another and he stayed on. But he insisted Wran was not a drug addict and that she was unaware of his dealings. ‘She takes drugs but she is not a full-on ice addict,’ he said. Wran, 26, was arrested on August 13 and later charged with murder, along with her friend of two weeks Michael Lee, 35, and a man she had just met, Lloyd Haines, 29. Khetkan told his friend that Wran’s mother Jill 'hates' him after he picked up her daughter from a 12-week, $80,000 rehabilitation program in Queensland after just two days. The Wran family told the Saturday Telegraph that Khetkan was 'a piece of slime'. Khetkan insisted Wran was not a drug addict although she took ice .

Khetkan claims he still has some of Wran’s belongings which she left with him when she went into rehab programs while they were together. 'We tried to keep apart, I wanted her to be clean,' he told the friend. Khetkan was released from jail in October last year after being arrested in August 2012 on drug charges. After her arrest the self-confessed ice addict told police she was 'numb on ice' desperate for a hit when she went to suspected drug dealer Mr McNulty's unit and was 'frozen' with fear during a fight which saw Mr McNulty killed and a second man, Brett Fitzgerald, wounded on his neck. A former friend of Wran's earlier came forward to describe her as a  'sensitive, caring, sweet woman', and the strength Ms Wran has showed over the years in her fierce battle with depression and addiction. Wran's friend, who wished to remain anonymous, insists that at heart Harriet Wran is 'a sweet, driven, intelligent' person and the public needs to understand the complexity of her situation. 'Harriet is a sensitive, caring, incredibly intelligent young woman but she struggled with the expectations of her family, which includes father Neville a former NSW premier. Her godfather was also the late billionaire Kerry Packer.","Sonny Khetkan says Harriet Warn relapsed after partying on his birthday .

This is the moment an adventurer who was set to become the first person to swim, cycle and run the entire length of the United Kingdom was forced to abandon his challenge after twisting his ankle while taking a selfie. Sean Conway, 33, had already become the first person in Britain to swim from Land's End to John O'Groats and had followed it up with cycling the length of the country too. However, the ultimate stage of his triathlon challenge – which was to run from Scotland to Cornwall – has now been scuppered after he fell over a rock and injured himself just 200 miles into the run. Scroll down for video . Sean Conway, 33, was attempting to run the length of the UK between John O'Groats and Land's End when he tripped over a rock and twisted his ankle while attempting to record a video selfie in the Loch Ness area .

The footage shows Mr Conway tumble over the rock and drop the camera on the floor as he winces in pain . He has now been forced to abandon the last leg of his triathlon - which would've seen him become the first person to swim, cycle and run the length of the UK. He had already completed the swim and cycle stages . Mr Conway dropped his camera after tripping over and could be heard wincing in pain before retrieving it . The keen adventurer tried to continue but the injury put pressure on his knee and after limping on for a couple of days he was forced to abandon his final challenge in Loch Ness after just 200 miles – around 700 miles short of his goal. Footage of him tripping over the rock was included in his video diary of his epic marathon and shows him speaking to the camera before falling to the ground - dropping the camera in the process - and wincing in pain.

Mr Conway, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said: 'I was doing a video selfie and I was just running along and I tripped up on a rock and slightly injured my ankle. 'But it really wasn't a serious injury at all - I was stretching and it was okay so I carried on running. 'Over the next few days with my ankle being injured and my knees taking over, some bad terrain and camber issues on the side of the road, all added to pressure building on my knees. 'I did take it easy, things were going well until a few days ago a simple wrong footing sent my body one way and my knee the other. 'Immediate pain. I knew straight away it was game over.'

However, after completing the swim and cycle stages of his triathlon, he failed at the final hurfle by injuring himself on the run . Writing on his blog, he added: 'It saddens me to say this, but I've finally been defeated by my body. 'I've taken a beating over the years, fractured spine when I got run over in America, stung by jellyfish in the face repeatedly for four months at sea, dislocated shoulders, ribs and thumbs falling down hills etc, but I have always somehow managed to carry on.

Aab Barik, in the north east of the country, was obliterated by a deadly landslide on Friday morning, which destroyed hundreds of homes and left as many as 4,000 people displaced. The official death toll in the wake of the disaster is around 500. But more than 2,000 other people have been recorded as missing and - since rescuers have given up trying to find more survivors - it is likely that they have died as well. Scroll down for video . Scarred landscape: The Afghan village of Aab Barik was engulfed when the hillside gave way after heavy rain . Path of destruction: This image shows the huge portion of a hillside which collapsed after heavy rains, crushing the village of Aab Barik below .

Vats: Charities and organisations such as the UN have reached the afflicted village despite poor transport . The United Nations on Sunday put the death toll from Friday's massive . landslide in Badakhshan province, bordering Tajikistan, at up to 500. Local officials say the number killed could be as high as 2,700. U.S. President Barack Obama called Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Sunday . to express his condolences and offer additional assistance, the White . House said in a statement. Today Afghan . army helicopters were delivering water, food, medicine and tents to the . disaster zone, while aid agencies and local relief workers slowly . arrived via the region's potholed roads. The UN agency in charge . of relief operations, the Office for the coordination of Humanitarian . Affairs (OCHA), said the displaced were largely being accommodated with . host families, with some in tents. It is unlikely the final figure will ever . be known, as officials say it is impossible to retrieve the bodies . buried in up to 160ft mud and debris. 'We cannot . continue the search and rescue operation anymore, as the houses are . under metres of mud,' said Gul Mohammad Bedaar, deputy governor of . Badakhshan province. 'We will offer prayers for the victims and make the . area a mass grave.' 'There . are thousands of families who are in desperate need of help and . hundreds of other homes are at risk, or possibly another landslide. The government and relief organisations . must act swiftly and send us more aid and equipment. What we have so . far is not enough.' Fears of another landslide prompted officials to . evacuate the remaining 700 families, or about 4,000 people, to safer . ground nearby. They may never return to live in their homes in Aab . Barik.

The billionaire co-owner of the Marx candy empire avoided jail on Thursday after she pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless driving in connection with a fatal accident in which a grandmother and an unborn baby were killed. Jacqueline Badger Mars, 74, had her driving license suspended for six months and was ordered to pay a $2,500 fine during a hearing in Loudoun County General District Court, Virginia. The judge could have sentenced Mars to a year on the misdemeanor charge; however, the family of victim Irene Ellisor asked the judge not to throw Mars in jail.

A . backseat passenger in the minivan - 86-year-old . grandmother Irene Ellisor, of Huntsville, Texas - was pronounced dead at . the scene. The minivan's driver, Ashley . Blakeslee, was eight months pregnant. Her unborn child, Charlie, died. Court papers say Mars told a witness she fell asleep just before the October crash. General District Judge Deborah Welsh, who called the crash 'horrible,' could have sentenced Mars to up to a year in jail on the misdemeanor charge. But the victim's relatives asked the judge not to incarcerate her, saying they have forgiven Mars. Tycoon: Mars is a divorced mother of three and the 15th wealthiest person in the world . Prosecutors did not seek jail time, . but left it to the judge's discretion and asked the judge to take the . family's wishes into account. Mars, who had a perfect driving record and tests showed no alcohol or drugs in her system, apologized for the crash and said she will live with grief for the rest of her life. When Mars received her court summons in . October, a personal spokesperson for her said: 'Jackie’s thoughts . and prayers remain with . those who have suffered injury and loss. She regrets this tragic . accident.' Mars is one of the richest people in the world with a net worth estimated at $20.5billion and is a resident of The Plains, Virginia.

"By . Sophie Freeman . It is said that when a man marries his mistress, he creates a vacancy. And research suggests the saying may well be right. Partners who are ‘poached’ from others are more likely to cheat in their new relationship, psychologists have found. Relationships that are formed by stealing someone’s partner are also more likely to be unhappy generally and are at a higher risk of break-up. Partners who are ‘poached’ from others are more likely to cheat in their new relationship, psychologists from the University of South Alabama have found (file pic) Scientists from the University of South Alabama asked 443 men and women how much they agreed with a series of statements to gauge their levels of commitment and satisfaction in their relationships. The statements included ‘I am aware that there are plenty more “fish in the sea”’, ‘I rarely notice other good-looking or attractive people’ and ‘our relationship makes me very happy’. Between 10 per cent and 30 per cent of participants in each of the studies said they were in relationships that began when they left one romantic partner for another. Professor Joshua Foster, lead author of the studies by the University of South Alabama, said: ‘Individuals who were poached by their current romantic partners were less committed, less satisfied, and less invested in their relationships. Scientists asked 443 men and women about their relationships . ‘They also paid more attention to romantic alternatives, perceived their alternatives to be of higher quality, and engaged in higher rates of infidelity compared to non-poached participants.’ The results, published in the Journal of Research in Personality, also showed that those who left one partner for another were more likely to possess negative personality traits such as being self-absorbed, vain or arrogant, as the scientists expected. But they were surprised to find that 'introverts' were more likely to be poached than extroverts. ‘The introversion finding was surprising because previous research suggested that people who get a lot of poaching attempts tend to have outgoing personalities (they’re extroverted),’ Professor Foster said. ‘But we found that people who are successfully poached are the opposite, that is socially passive. It might be that being outgoing puts you in a position to get a lot of attempts - perhaps simply because you’re around people more - but being passive makes you more likely to go along with the attempts and actually get poached.’","Relationships formed by 'poaching' more likely to be unhappy, scientists say .

"By . Laura Cox . A young mother and her two infant children were strangled to death by her ex-con friend, police revealed on Friday, as the friend was charged with their murder. 23-year-old Heather Jackson's body was found brutally slain at her home in Ohio on Saturday, alongside her three-year-old daughter Celina and son, Wayne, aged 18 months. All three died of strangulation, a coroner found, and police are investigating the identity of a murder weapon. Tragic: The smiling mother and daughter, Heather Jackson (right) and three-year-old Celina . Curtis Clinton is accused of strangling to death Heather Jackson and her two young children . The man allegedly behind the killings, 41-year-old Curtis Clinton, was charged with three counts of aggravated murder, seven months after being released from a 13-year term for assault and involuntary manslaughter. Police say he was invited into Jackson's home, where the bodies were later found. Concerned friends had asked officers to check on the young mother, having not heard from her all day, and at around 8pm police made the grisly discovery. Jackson's lifeless body had been shoved between a mattress and a bed frame, with her children's hidden inside a closet, NorwalkRegister.com reported. She and her children had lived in the property for around a month, police said, and she had known Clinton for about five months. 23-year-old Heather Jackson's body was found brutally slain at her home in Ohio on Saturday, alongside her three-year-old daughter Celina (right) and son, Wayne, aged 18 months (left) It is not yet known what his motive was but police say he has a lengthy criminal history including the assault and manslaughter conviction, over the death of 18-year-old Misty Keckler in 1997. She was found dead from strangulation in a Fostoria mobile home and Clinton pleaded guilty two years later. At this stage officers say they believe Clinton acted without an accomplice, though they are continuing to investigate and conduct interviews. He was arrested on Monday from the Bellevue Hospital, where he was receiving unspecified treatment. Already facing charges of raping a 13-year-old girl, the registered sex offender is being held on $3million bond. He is being held in the Erie County Jail, where he will stay until another court appearance next Tuesday.","23-year-old Heather Jackson found strangled to death at her Ohio home .

"By . Dan Wootton . Face for radio: Chris Moyles, as King Herod in Jesus Christ Superstar, has been axed from Channel 4 . Loudmouth Chris Moyles’s bid to launch a TV career has taken a major blow after Channel 4 axed his show, privately declaring that ‘he just doesn’t work on screen’. Since being dumped by Radio 1’s breakfast show, Moyles, 39, has made TV stardom his goal, even shedding over 5st to be more appealing to HD cameras. The DJ has also cut ties with his loyal agent of ten years, Vivienne Clore, to sign with James Grant, the agency that represents prime-time stars Ant and Dec, Holly Willoughby and Vernon Kay. However, Channel 4 bosses have decided Chris Moyles’s Quiz Night, which ran for six series between 2008 and 2012, will not return. And they do not want to work with the DJ on another project. Meanwhile, Sky Living dating show, Love Machine, which he hosts with former X Factor contestant Stacey Solomon, is also unlikely to be back. My Channel 4 insider explains: ‘We tried with Chris. But the reality is he just doesn’t work on screen. 'Viewers never took to him. The problem wasn’t with the Quiz Night format, it was with Chris himself.’ Moyles had hoped to make another series of Quiz Night following his stint as King Herod in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s touring production of Jesus Christ Superstar. But it is now back to the drawing board. A source close to him tells me: ‘He’s in America working on new projects. Channel 4 was never the be all and end all to his future on TV. He’s very confident of having big news soon.’ Angering Auntie: Chris Moyles refused to take on anew role at the BBC after he was replaced as a presenter for Radio 1 . However, Moyles has infuriated executives at the BBC since they replaced him on Radio 1’s breakfast show with Nick Grimshaw because he was considered too old for the youth station. He’s been taken off the BBC payroll after he refused to consider a new role, despite being on a £1 million, two-year contract until 2014. High demands: Sharon Osbourne may return to the X Factor if the price is right . When Sharon Osbourne quit The X Factor five years ago it was in a row over her salary as she demanded a £500,000 pay increase which would see her earn more than £2 million a year. Now I hear money could again cause problems as Simon Cowell prepares to bring her back to the panel for the ITV talent show’s tenth anniversary. Sharon, whose strained marriage to Ozzy Osbourne hit the headlines again this week, has existing work commitments in the U.S., where she is a panellist on daily show The Talk. My X-Factor source reveals: ‘Sharon . wants a lot of money either to commmute from Los Angeles to London every . week or take a leave of absence from The Talk.’ But her stance is causing massive . issues for producers as existing judge Nicole Scherzinger is also so far . refusing to sign, suggesting her music career might be her priority . this year. My show source adds: ‘We’re unsure if this is a ploy for . Nicole to also get a pay increase.’ Last year’s judge Tulisa has not been officially told if her services are required because she is viewed as a ‘back-up option’. Hungarian shadow dancers Attraction — who stole the show on Saturday’s Britain’s Got Talent — are accused of being copycats. Attraction is fast becoming the most popular act with bookies since Susan Boyle in 2009. However, my sources on America’s Got Talent claim their routine is very similar to The Silhouettes, a dance troupe on the U.S. show in 2011. The American version featured the outlines of U.S. landmarks. Same shadows: Hungarian dance troupe Attraction, who appeared on Britain's Got Talent on Saturday, have been caused of being a copycat act . ‘Attraction was presented as being unique, but one search on YouTube makes it obvious that this was a concept pioneered by someone else,’ says my source. A Britain’s Got Talent source confirmed: ‘We don’t deny Attraction are a similar act to The Silhouettes. But that couldn’t stop them auditioning.’ ITV has had 15 complaints about Attraction being from Hungary, given the show is Britain’s Got Talent, while there have been fewer than ten each about the sexually provocative lyrics in 11-year-old Arisxandra Libantino’s performance of One Night Only and Keri Graham’s erotic dance. Hotly tipped magician Ben Earl had to get permission from the Government before signing with Channel 4 for his first major TV series. Before launching a TV career, the  30-year-old, who is described as a ‘world-class sleight-of-hand artist’, was recruited by intelligence agencies to work with the military as a consultant on deception skills. He tells me: ‘I can’t say who exactly I work for, but they were initially concerned about me doing the show. We came to an agreement that I wouldn’t use any of the specific tactics that I use during my sessions with the military on the show.’ His series, Trick Artist, begins next Friday.","Former BBC Radio1 host Chris Moyles's show axed by Channel 4 .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Collecting accurate, real-time data on earthquakes has always been a problem for seismologists. But a tiny sensor found in smartphones could help fill in the gaps by instantly turning your mobile phone into an earthquake sensor. The chip, originally intended to change the orientation of the screen, can detect earthquakes greater than a magnitude of 5, according to a new study. Scroll down for video... A tiny sensor found in smartphones could instantly turn your mobile phone into an earthquake sensor, according to a new study . Known as a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) accelerometer, the sensors measures the rate of acceleration of ground motion and vibration of cars, buildings and installations. MEMS is also used in laptops to detect the motion of falling, and in computer games to sense movement and speed. Antonino D'Alessandro and Giuseppe D'Anna, both seismologists at the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Italy, wanted to see whether the sensor could also reliably detect ground motion caused by earthquakes. The test showed that the MEMS accelerometers could detect moderate to strong earthquakes, greater than magnitude 5, such as the one that hit Pakistan earlier this month . They tested the LIS331DLH MEMS accelerometer in an iPhone and compared it to the earthquake sensor EpiSensor ES-T force balance accelerometer. The test showed that the MEMS accelerometers could detect moderate to strong earthquakes, greater than magnitude 5, when located near the epicentre. The researchers believe the technology will soon be advanced enough to detect quakes less than magnitude 5. The real advantage, they say, is the widespread use of mobile phones and laptops that include MEMS technology, making it possible to dramatically increase coverage when strong earthquakes occur. VIDEO: The iShake app developed by University of California, Berkeley . Their hope is to create an urban seismic network that could transmit real-time ground motion data to a central location. This isn’t the first time that smartphone sensors have been used to detect earthquakes. A few years ago, University of California, Berkeley released the free iShake app which turns your iPhone into an earthquake-measuring device. Any possible earthquake triggers are measured by your phone and instantly streamed back to our University servers for further processing and map generation. ‘The dense network of recorded shaking intensity data, and eventually other information, will have a significant impact on academia, industry, and government,’ said the research team.","MEMS sensors can detect earthquakes greater than a magnitude of 5 .

"By . Mark Prigg . Life existed before Earth, and may have originated outside out solar system, researchers have claimed. Geneticists have used a theory that usually governs the speed increases of computers - and applied it to life. The results suggest life first appeared about 10 billion years ago - long before Earth, which is believed to be 4.5 billion years old. The start of life on Earth? Geneticists have used a theory that usually governs the speed increases of computers - and applied it to life. The results suggest life first appeared about 10 billion years ago - long before Earth, which is believed to be 4.5 billion years old. Panspermia is the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe and is spread by meteoroids, asteroids and planetoids. Panspermia proposes that life forms that can survive the effects of space, such as extremophiles, become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life. These life-forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks. If met with ideal conditions on a new planet's surfaces, the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins, it is believed. Moore's Law is the observation that computers increase exponentially in . complexity, at a rate of about double the transistors per integrated . circuit every two years. If you apply Moore's Law to just the last few . years' rate of computational advances and work backwards, you end up in the 1960s, when the first microchip were invented. Alexei Sharov at the National Institute on Ageing in Baltimore . Richard Gordon at the Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory in . Florida,decided to apply this theory to life and see when it began. The pair argue that it’s possible to measure the complexity of life . and the rate at which it has increased from prokaryotes to eukaryotes to . more complex creatures such as worms, fish and finally mammals. 'Linear regression of genetic complexity (on a log scale) extrapolated . back to just one base pair suggests the time of the origin of life = 9.7 . ± 2.5 billion years ago,' they say in a paper published in the online journal Arxiv. The theory backs the idea of panspermia, a theory that proposes that life forms that can survive the effects of space, such as extremophiles, become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life. These life-forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks.

The results suggest life first appeared about 10 billion years ago - long before Earth, which is believed to be 4.5 billion years old. However, the researchers admit much of their work is theoretical. 'There are lots of hypothetical elements to [our argument]… but . to make a wider view, you need some hypothetical elements,' Sharov told . TechNewsDaily. 'Contamination . with bacterial spores from space appears the most plausible hypothesis . that explains the early appearance of life on Earth,' they argue in the . paper. Sharov . said that if he had to bet on it, he’d say 'it's 99 percent true that . life started before Earth — but we should leave 1 percent for some wild . chance that we haven’t accounted for.'","Geneticists applied Moore's law of computer power to life - and found it adds weight to the theory life originated away from Earth .

"By . Anna Edwards . Danny James says the attitude of local jobseekers is 'a disgrace' A company boss who advertised 50 vacancies in a city with nearly 2,000 unemployed has branded local jobseekers 'lazy' after nobody came forward. Danny James, owner of recruitment agency Consistent Personnel, urgently required unskilled workers for at least three months' work at a local food factory. But when he posted an advert at the local Jobcentre not a single person came forward in time for the start of the contract. Mr James said the response was 'unbelievable' and the attitude of local job-seekers was 'a disgrace'. Recruitment boss Mr James claims that many do not want to work and have no intention of taking menial jobs they are offered. He said: 'If I lost my job, I would have a job tomorrow, even if it was cleaning toilets. I don't understand the mindset of these people.' Mr James contacted Worcester Jobcentre at about 12.20pm on October 9 seeking people for warehouse work at the local Senoble food factory, which would last through the Christmas period. The firm then followed up the call with an e-mail at 12.41pm with more details about the minimum-wage £6.31-per-hour jobs. Inductions for the Monday-to-Friday roles were due to begin at 5pm that day, before the shift. However, a job centre source said the problem was the 'very short timescale' given to find people for a night shift. Mr James, 29, said: 'People need no skills whatsoever. New figures released last week revealed there are more jobseekers than available jobs in Worcester, with 1,870 residents signed on . 'It's the most simple cake-packing, box-stacking position. My three-year-old daughter could do it. But not one person has rung me up. 'It's a disgrace. Everybody should know. People who pay their taxes will be so disappointed in that. 'There is work and it is beyond me why nobody has rung me. They couldn't even get me one person. It's unbelievable. 'I see so many people hanging around on street corners, people outside the job centre smoking and then something like this comes up where I need just 50 people old enough to work in a factory. 'It's beyond me that they can't even get one person from the job centre. It is so very frustrating. Recruitment boss Mr James claims that many do not want to work . 'The only conditions are that they have to be over 18 and have a national insurance number and no criminal convictions. You don't need any experience whatsoever.' Mr James managed to get 10 people himself by using his contacts, records and by calling friends, claiming he had effectively had to act as a Jobcentre himself to fill at least some of the positions. But one of those who considered the job hit back saying he had no choice because he is better off on benefits. Dean Scollan, 37, says it is 'not worth the money' because the take-home pay of £220 will leave him out of pocket. 'I do want to work but what is the point of me going if it's going to make me worse off?' he said. 'I'm not going to work for peanuts. 'If the finances were right, I would have gone for the induction. I would have got a pushbike and gone up there but it wasn't worth the money.' The Senoble job would only earn him £200 to £220 per week after tax, less than he received on benefits, he said. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said the short notice of the shifts meant staff were unable to fill the roles. 'Every day Jobcentre Plus staff up and down the country are successfully helping employers fill their vacancies and get people into work,' he said. 'On this occasion, however, the very short timescale given by the agency and the need for jobseekers to be available to work the night shift, that same day, meant we were unable to help on this occasion.' Robin Walker, MP for Worcester, said: 'It seems disappointing that there aren't people prepared to take those jobs. 'You would have thought there would have been a reasonable amount of take-up given the number of people out of work.'","Danny James, owner of a recruitment agency, needed unskilled workers .

"By . Tamara Cohen . and Tim Shipman . A Tory MP has called for the resignation of Sir David Nicholson for 'presiding over a culture of secrecy and cover-up that cost many people their lives'. Andrew Bridgen, one of whose constituents died in the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, said the NHS chief executive should quit because of his involvement in the controversy. Between 400 and 1,200 died needlessly between 2005 and 2008 because bosses at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust put meeting Labour government targets ahead of patient safety. Time to go: The Daily Mail has called Sir David Nicholson to account over the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal . Sir David was previously head of West Midlands Strategic Health Authority between 2005 and 2006 – the body supervising Mid Staffordshire – but failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care. In fact at the height of the scandal, he wrote a letter congratulating managers having toured the trust's two hospitals, Stafford and Cannock Chase. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, one of whose constituents died in the scandal, has called on Sir David to resign . Sir David insists he is 'not ashamed' to still be in his job and has blamed failings on the 'whole system'. But nine out of ten NHS staff believe he should quit his £270,000-a-year post, two polls revealed last week. In an article published today, Mr Bridgen, who represents Leicestershire North West, also attacks the 'culture of cosy cover-ups' in the NHS including the gagging orders imposed on doctors, nurses and managers. Last week the Daily Mail revealed that in only three years there were 598 'special severance payments', almost all of which carried draconian confidentiality clauses aimed at silencing whistleblowers. They cost the taxpayer £14.7million. Mr Bridgen said: 'I think it is very difficult to lead an organisation where 90 per cent of the staff do not have confidence in you, so he should consider his position.' He writes on the ConservativeHome website: 'It is becoming increasingly clear that a culture of cosy cover-ups has been allowed to develop in the NHS and that is something that has got to change. 'Whilst I have no doubt that Sir David Nicholson is committed and knowledgeable about the NHS, you cannot get away from the fact that he has presided over a culture of secrecy and cover up that has cost many people their lives. 'Can a man so embroiled in this culture really be the person to oversee what Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt calls a new culture of openness and transparency... to ensure we never repeat the mistakes'?' Shocking: Stafford General Hospital was one of two where between 400 and 1,200 patients died needlessly . Mr Bridgen's article concludes: 'Failing like this would not be tolerated in a private hospital and they should not be tolerated within the NHS. 'In the private sector, management would have been held accountable. We need to usher in a new era of transparency and candour if we are to address failures of care within the NHS.' Mr Bridgen's constituents include the family of John Moore-Robinson, 20, who died in 2006 from internal bleeding which was not picked up by doctors in Stafford Hospital's A&E unit. He had fallen off his mountain bike and ruptured his spleen. He was vomiting and in agony but was diagnosed with a few fractured ribs and sent home with painkillers. He died hours later at his home in Coalville, Leicestershire. He also believes Labour health secretary Andy Burnham should have held a public inquiry into the failings at Mid Staffordshire, which may have brought these to light earlier. Failure: Sir David even wrote letters congratulating the hospitals' managers at the height of the scandal . It has emerged that Mr Burnham rejected 81 requests for a full public inquiry in the last year of Labour's government 2009-10, 20 from MPs and the others from the public, victims and organisations. Mr Bridgen's intervention is significant because he is a Tory MP and his call for Sir David to quit goes against David Cameron, who seems determined  to prop him up. The Prime Minister said last week that Sir David has his full backing and that he 'does a very good job'. Mr Cameron said: 'It seemed to me that he had properly apologised and acknowledged the mistakes that the regional health authority had made. 'We should not be seeking scapegoats and I think to highlight David Nicholson in that way would be seeking a scapegoat.'","Tory MP Andrew Bridgen is calling for Sir David Nicholson to resign .

"By . Paul Bentley . They say there’s no greater happiness than having children. But if research is to be believed, the truth is rather less optimistic. Spending time with your nearest and dearest makes us far less happy than being with our  friends, according to a survey. In fact, researchers found only the company of work colleagues and clients is more depressing.Researchers at the London School of Economics collated data from smartphone users who used an app to log their levels of happiness over a three-year period. Spending time with your family makes you far less happy than being with friends according to new research . The Mapiness app, designed by . academic George MacKerron with the LSE, works by sending alerts to users . at random intervals, asking them how happy and relaxed they were . feeling at that moment, what they were doing and who they were with. Around 50,000 people have downloaded the app, logging three million responses. On average, respondents’ moods . improved by more than 8 per cent when they were with friends, but this . fell to 5.9 per cent when with their partners. And happiness levels rose by just 1.4 . per cent when with their children – less than walking, going to the . library and drinking alcohol. This result was only slightly higher . than the 0.7 per cent improvement in mood when they were with clients or . customers at work. The results surprised those who took . part. Rachael Gaunt, 49, an architect from St Ives in Cornwall, said: . ‘The results were not as I expected, as they suggested I was happiest . when alone and outdoors, which does not typically represent the life of a . full-time working architect, mother of two young boys and generally . busy person.’ The results have been reported by researchers from the London School of Economics, who collated data from tens of thousands of smartphone users, who used an app to log their levels of happiness over a three year period. The activity which makes us happiest is sex, which raised moods by an average of 14 per cent . The results stunned those who took part, who were not aware of how much less happy they felt when at home. The study attempted to record how happy people genuinely feel in specific moments, rather than how they view how happy they were in retrospect, which can be distorted. Researchers did this by using an app titled Mappiness, which was developed by academic George MacKerron in conjunction with the LSE. About 50,000 people have signed up to use it since 2010. After downloading the app, users received randomly generated ‘dings’ on their phones, which would ask them how happy and relaxed they were feeling at that moment, what they were doing and who they were with. Only responses received within an hour were included in the data. Analysis of the replies, of which there are now 3million, shows people are far happier when with their friends than with family. The activity which makes us happiest is sex, which raised moods by an average of 14 per cent. Researchers, moreover, believe this to be an understatement because people are unlikely to reach for their phones during the act. Other activities which rated highly were going to the theatre or a concert, visiting anexhibition, museum or library, sports and gardening. People who work in an office were twice as unhappy as those who work from home . At the other end of the spectrum, being sick in bed made us most depressed, reducing mood by 20.4 per cent. Friends  8.2%Spouse/partner  5.9%Other family  2.9%Children  1.4%Clients/customers  0.7%Colleagues/classmates 0.6% . *Percentage improvement in mood, compared to being alone . Working or studying is also a downer, lowering levels of happiness by 5.4 per cent relative to other activities. People who work in an office were twice as unhappy as those who work from home and men were found to be less happy at work than women. Those who are least happy at work are those in long-term relationships, but those with childre were not quite so upset to be away from home and in the office. Working conditions, of course, vary widely and this was reflected in levels of wellbeing. People who earned less than £12,000 a year were far happier when at work than those with higher wages. Shifters who work before 6am, after 6pm or at the weekend were twice as unhappy as those who have more stable hours during the day. Being sick in bed made us most depressed, reducing mood by 20.4 per cent . Alex Bryson, who conducted the research, told the Sunday Times: ‘Even though people are positive about paid work when reflecting on the meaning and value of their lives, actually engaging in paid work comes at some personal cost in terms of the pressures and stress they face. ‘Wellbeing at work varies significantly with your circumstances and these can be influenced by public policies to facilitate “happier” working conditions.’ Another study by the World Happiness Database in Rotterdam suggests it is possible to make ourselves feel happier. Though it is generally assumed that you need goals to lead a happy life, evidence is mixed. 1 Intimacy/ making love  14.2% . 2 Theatre/ dance/ concert  9.3% . 3 Exhibition/ museum/ library  8.8% . 4 Sports/ exercise  8.1% . 5 Gardening/ allotment  7.8% . 6 Singing/ performing  6.9% . 7 Talking/ chatting/ socialising  6.4% . 8 Nature watching  6.3% . 9 Walking/ hiking  6.2% . 10 Hunting/ fishing  5.8% . 11 Drinking alcohol  5.7% . 12 Hobbies/ arts and crafts  5.5% . 13 Meditating/ religious activities  4.9% . 14 Sports event  4.4% . 15 Childcare/ playing with children  4.1% . 1 Reading  1.5% . 2 Listening to a speech  1.4% . 3 Washing/ dressing/ grooming  1.2% . 4 Sleeping/ resting/ relaxing  1.1% . 5 Smoking  0.7% . 6 Browsing the net  0.6% . 7 Texting/ email/ social media  0.6% . 8 Housework/ DIY  -0.7% . 9 Travelling/ commuting  -1.5% . 10 In a meeting/ seminar/ class  -1.5% . 11 Admin/ finances/ organising  -2.5% . 12 Waiting/ queuing  -3.5 . 13 Care or help for adults -4.3 . 14 Work/ studying  -5.4 . 15 Sick in bed  -20.4 . 'The reason seems to be that unhappy people are more aware of their goals, because they seek to change their life for the better,' explained Professor Ruut Veenhoven, Director of the Database and Emeritus professor of social conditions for human happiness at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. Leading an active life is believed to be the key to happiness. 'In order to have a happy life, a rewarding life you need to be active. So involvement is more important to happiness than meaning in the sense of why, why we are here. 'Research has shown that we can make ourselves happier because happiness changes over time. These changes are not just a matter of better circumstances but of better dealing with life. Elderly people tend to be wiser and for that reason, happier.' Studies collated by the database say you tend to be happier if you are in a long-term relationship, are actively engaged in politics, are active in work and in your free time, go out for dinner and have close friendships although happiness does not increase with the number of friends you have. A German study (by Frey and Stutzer published in 2004) found a strong link between time spent commuting and satisfaction with life. Those who spent an hour on their journey to work were found to be significantly less happy that those who did not commute.","Researchers recorded people's moods using an app called Mappiness .

Police said a man from Kiama, Australia, has been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and obstructing a territory official. He has been bailed and it scheduled to return to court in September. Australian Federal Police detained the assailant until the plane landed at Sydney Airport . Commander Michael Chew, manager aviation with AFP, warned passengers of the consequences of behaving violently on flights. He said: ‘The AFP will not tolerate this type of behaviour. Aviation safety is a serious matter, and abusive behaviour poses a serious risk to the travelling public.’ Friday’s attack was one of two air rage incidents that police in Australia have had to deal with in recent days. A light plane was forced to make an emergency landing earlier today when an 82-year-old passenger assaulted the 23-year-old pilot, according to police in Oberon, about 110 miles west of Sydney. The pilot restrained the 82-year-old, who was the only passenger, and landed the plane in a paddock. Police said the passenger was taken to hospital to be treated for head and facial injuries, while the pilot was treated for shock.","Violent attack occurred on Qantas flight from Manila to Sydney .

The premises in Haxey, Lincolnshire have stood empty since the businesses which once occupied them moved out.

"By . Sara Smyth . Made peace: Emma Thompson has forgiven Helena Bonham-Carter for the affair that ended her marriage to Kenneth Branagh, seen in Beverley Hills on Tuesday . Emma Thompson has spoken for the first time about her then husband Kenneth Branagh’s affair with Helena Bonham Carter. The liaison ended Miss Thompson’s six-year marriage to Branagh, who she wed in 1989 just two years after they met while filming. Miss Thompson said the break-up was ‘all blood under the bridge’, adding: ‘You can’t hold on to anything like that. ‘It’s pointless. I haven’t got the energy for it. Helena and I made our peace years and years ago.’ The 54-year-old double Oscar winner has spoken candidly about the depression that she suffered following the end of her marriage in 1995. Miss Bonham Carter is believed to have started an affair with Branagh in 1994 while she played his love interest in Branagh’s version of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.They had a five-year relationship. Miss Thompson said she channelled her feelings of betrayal into her portrayal of a wronged wife in Richard Curtis’s romantic comedy Love Actually. ‘I’ve had so much bloody practice at crying in a bedroom, then having to go out and be cheerful, gathering up the pieces of my heart and putting them in a drawer,’ she said. Miss Thompson says there are similarities between her and Miss Bonham Carter, 47, which may have appealed to Branagh, 52: ‘Being slightly mad and a bit fashion-challenged. ‘Perhaps that’s why Ken loved us both. She’s a wonderful woman, Helena’. Scroll down for video . The 54-year-old double Oscar winner, pictured on her wedding day with Branagh in 1989, said she made peace with Helena Bonham-Carter, pictured right with Branagh in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, 'years and years ago' Miss Thompson is married to Greg Wise, an actor and producer whom she met on the set of the 1995 version of Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility. The couple have one daughter, Gaia, 13, and a son, Tindyebwa Agaba, 26, a former child soldier from Rwanda whom they informally adopted when he was 16. Miss Bonham Carter has two children, Billy, ten, and Nell, five, with her partner, film director Tim Burton. Miss Thompson has starred in two films with Miss Bonham Carter: Howard’s End in 1992 and the Harry Potter series from 2007. Lady in red: Emma appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show on Monday night, and was having an absolute hoot as she acted out animal noises with the chat show host . In 2002, Miss Bonham Carter said her relationships had been misunderstood in the press, alluding to allegations of her affair with Branagh, and later, Burton. ‘Yes. I’m a habitual, serial home breaker, apparently,’ she said. ‘It gets frustrating because I know the story and the truth of it. It is very hurtful and, frankly, some of the things I have been called are quite libellous. ‘But it’s part of the price of being in the public eye.’ Mulling things over: The British actress looked incredible in a loose-fitting scarlet trouser suit and simple white blouse .","The liaison ended Miss Thompson's six-year marriage to Branagh .

"By . Sam Webb . Harry Potter fans have been offered a glimpse into the teenage wizard’s future after JK Rowling resurrected her hero for a new short story that reunites him with his old friends at a Hogwarts School reunion. The 1,500-word story, published on the writer’s Pottermore website, describes the now 34-year-old Harry as having 'threads of silver' in his black hair. Ron Weasley, played in the hit films by Rupert Grint, has aged less well with his ginger hair 'thinning slightly'. Scroll down for video .

He is revealed to be co-manager of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes with his brother George after working for two years at the Ministry of Magic. His wife Hermione, Harry’s wife Ginny, and their children all feature in the story. The supremely capable Hermione is now Deputy Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Rowling also gives fans a hint of Harry’s new life by describing a mysterious cut over his cheekbone, perhaps related to his membership of a top-secret group of wizards called the Aurors. The story is set during a Quidditch tournament - the fictional sport played by the student wizards on flying broomsticks in the best-selling books that is so popular with fans that they have adapted a version of the game that can really be played. Protege: Harry Potter's son Albus, pictured here in the final film of the series, is also mentioned in the short story .

Rowling hit the headlines recently when she stated her support for a No vote in the Scottish independence referendum, a £1 million donation to Better Together and a blog detailing the “serious risks” of independence. The Harry Potter author, who lives in Edinburgh, has just published her second crime thriller under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The story, 'Dumbledore's Army Reunites At Quidditch World Cup Final', is written as a feature by Daily Prophet muckraker Rita Skeeter, who is at the Quidditch World Cup Final being held in the Patagonian Desert in Argentina. Harry and his cohorts are revealed to be special guests at the event and are still massive celebrities in the wizarding world. Skeeter described scenes of pandemonium as Harry et al arrive. The wizard is described as having 'threads of silver' in his dark hair and is still wearing his distinctive round glasses. He is also described as having a scar on his cheek, which the journalist speculates is related to his work as an auror. His wife Ginny is revealed to be a reporter - somewhat jealously by rival Skeeter - for the Prophet reporting on the final. Harry also warmly greets former rival and Bulgarian Quidditch player Viktor Krum. After two years at the Ministry of Magic, Ron Weasley is now the co-owner of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes with his brother George. His famous red hair is 'thinning slightly'.

"By . Ray Massey . If your budget won’t stretch to a brand new Bentley, you can now at least smell like one for a fraction of the price. The British car-maker has launched a range of fragrances for men – including a limited edition bottle which will cost £3,000. Bentley bosses say the perfume collection captures the ‘essence’ of their powerful supercars – with hints of leather and wood rather than engine oil and unleaded. The Crystal Edition scent comes in a crystal bottle shaped like the Bentley Flying B and costs £3,000 . The perfume is a snip of the price of a £225,000 Bentley Mulsanne . Old-school ‘Bentley Boys’ who turn up their noses at such commercialism may be tempted to call it  Eau de Crewe – after the northern town where the car-maker is based. Others may think the idea has more than a whiff of their Premier League football star customers about it. The bespoke Lalique for Bentley Crystal Edition –  in a 40cl crystal bottle shaped like the legendary ‘Flying B’ Bentley mascot – carries a £3,000 price tag. But that’s still a fraction of the cost of the £225,000 Bentley Mulsanne, or the more modestly priced £124,000 Continental GT Coupe. Bentley says its collaboration with French crystal maker Lalique and its owner Art & Fragrance showcases the finest glassmaking expertise and is limited to only 999 pieces, available at ‘carefully selected retailers’ from April. The car-maker notes: ‘Finely wrought in gleaming crystal, the dynamic styling of its wings epitomises timeless beauty.’ The eau de parfum itself was created by Mylène Alran from the French perfume house Robertet. Bentley said:’It is a fitting elixir of fine woody notes and exquisite leather to complement the epicentres of excellence within Bentley’s craftsmanship. ‘Precious orris butter accord enriches the scent to create a sensual and charismatic character. ‘ . Silvio Denz, chief executive of Lalique said: ’Bentley and Lalique have a similar history. 'Both companies were founded almost 100 years ago. Both stand for craftsmanship and tradition, but also for luxury, lifestyle and innovation. 'To create a fragrance together is to capture the essence of our skills and our vision in a bottle.’ Bentley designer Daniele Ceccomor said: ’The crystal edition is a masterpiece of craftsmanship, reflecting the unrivalled luxury and elegant values of both Bentley and Lalique. ‘Just as the Flying B sits gracefully on the front of our flagship Mulsanne model, we wanted to communicate the same importance with the preciousness of the crystal artwork and the uniqueness of the essence treasured by its delicate flacon.' The limited fragrance, with only 999 bottles being produced, is available from April . The firm – now owned by German car giant Volkswagen -  has also produced Bentley for Men and Bentley for Men Intense scents. The eau de toilette will cost £43 for a 60 ml bottle and £59.50 for 100 ml. The  Intense eau de parfum costs £69.50 for 100 ml. There is also an aftershave balm at £32 and Hair & Body Shampoo at £24. These fragrances have been created by Nathalie Lorson, from the perfume house Firmenich, and include hints of black pepper, musk, rum, bay leaves and cinnamon. Bentley said: ’[Lorson] has skilfully transformed the quintessence of the luxury automotive brand Bentley into a superb and unmistakeable fragrance experience. 'To do so, the finest perfume raw ingredients have been used, including those must-haves for Bentley’s debut fragrance, fine wood and leather notes.’ Lorson said: ‘I chose cedar because of its powerful unadulterated scent and patchouli for its sensual depth and natural elegance. 'The ‘Intense’ version will take these notes to another level by infusing the rich scent with aromatic African geranium.' She added: ’The bottle design echoes the luxury of the cars with an elegant symmetrical shape, striking appeal and a knurled ring around the top.’ These fragrances will also be available at selected perfumeries and department stores from April.","British car-maker 'captures the essence' of its supercars in a bottle .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Police have launched an investigation to find thieves who intricately unearthed memorial geraniums planted in honour of First World War soldiers. More than 80 of the 500 commemorative plants in Dunham Massey, Cheshire, were carefully dug out of the soil in two late-night attacks. It is thought the thieves were jealous and wanted the red flowers for their own gardens . Distraught: 86 of 500 memorial geraniums  in Dunham Massey, Cheshire, to honour First World War soldiers were 'intricately' dug up in late-night raids. Paul Lord, chair of the parish council, said the thieves were jealous . 'Calculated': Mr Lord said the attack was too clean to be done by vandals as police interview villagers . Parish Council chairman Paul Lord said: 'It is clear to us all that they have been taken by people who are so impressed with the displays that they want them in their own gardens. It is either that or people think that they can sell them on at car boot sales or something similar. 'Each time the flowers have been taken away very carefully so it cannot be vandals otherwise they would have been strewn everywhere. 'It seems to us all that these plants have just ended up in a lot of people’s gardens.' The £300 flowers were planted last week as part of the village's efforts to mark the centenary of the First World War. Two days later, residents awoke to find 40 of the poppy-red geraniums missing. The next morning, a further 46 had been intricately dug up. Police have now been dispatched to the rural Cheshire community - where the population is just 475 - to take statements about the thefts in what is being dubbed a 'bloom-dunnit' by locals. Honour: The red plants, a nod to poppies, were bedded last week in honour of First World War soldiers . Investigation: Police have been dispatched to the Saxon town, which has one of Britain's lowest crime rates . Villager Susan Brotherton, 59, said: 'It’s despicable really, what some people will do in this day and age. Flowers have been stolen before but not on this scale - and they obviously wanted them. 'I doubt very much people from round here will have taken them. It’s a nice area and people would not steal from the neighbours. It’s such a shame because there is never any crime in Dunham Massey. 'It would nice to think they would put the plants back after the upset that has been caused - but I’m not holding my breath.' Jane Leopold, who lives on a barge near to the village and works at a tea room said: 'Nothing bad ever happens here so it’s a shock. 'The people who did this must be putting the plants in their own garden. It’s terrible. It was a nice thing to do to have the flowers so it just shows what people are like today. 'It’s such a shame but it won’t be anyone from the village. We’ve never had anything stolen in Dunham before. It’s the kind of place where you can leave your stuff outside and no one will take it.' Catherine Bushell, 75, lives in the village, said: 'We were all devastated. A lot of people had put a lot of time into making this flower bed look lovely. 'It’s always had a nice show of flowers so I don’t know why anyone would want to ruin it. They must want to sell them I guess. Search: Mr Lord has urged police to check people's gardens for the plants after the rare attack on the village . Historic: The quaint village of 450 people in leafy Cheshire has 45 listed buildings and a 197-acre deer park . 'The villagers have been talking about nothing else but no-one can think who it might be who is responsible. My son’s a farmer so he helped fetch the plants and plant them so it’s a shame it has been ruined.' In a statement Greater Manchester Police said: 'Officers answered a report of 86 plants being taken from flower beds. The circumstances of where they were taken is unknown but inquiries are continuing.' The former Saxon village, which is listed in the Domesday Book, has one of the lowest crime rates in Britain. Known for its magnificent Georgian stately home, it has a 197-acre deer park that dates back to 1353. The name Dunham is derived from the Anglo-Saxon ‘dun’ meaning hill. The Massey element of the name is a result of its ownership by the Massey family. Dunham Massey Hall became the home of the manorial lord and was built in 1616 and is currently owned by the National Trust. In the village there are 45 listed residences, most of them dating from the 18th or early 19th century, and many of them featuring Flemish bond brickwork.","86 of 500 geraniums planted in honour of WWI soldiers intricately dug up .

"By . Steve Robson . and Nick Pisa . Amanda Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito are anxiously waiting to find out if their acquittal for the murder of a British student will be overturned by Italy's highest court. Supreme Court judges will rule on Monday on whether there should be a retrial regarding the death of Meredith Kercher or if the case against them should be closed completely. In 2011 Knox and Sollecito were cleared of the 2007 murder on appeal after they had initially been found guilty and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively. Anxious wait: Amanda Know, left, and former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, right, will find out on Monday it they are officially clear of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher in 2007 . Meredith, 21, was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom in the house she shared with American Knox in the picturesque Italian hill top town of Perugia. The case made headlines around the world amid allegations of sex games, drugs and jealousy during their first trial in 2009. Victim: Student Meredith Kercher, 21, was found murdered in the picturesque Italian town of Perugia . Knox and Sollecito were found guilty but . were cleared two years later after a fresh hearing uncovered a bungled . police investigation. Defence lawyers and experts revealed how evidence had been contaminated or poorly handled by forensic teams and that the conviction should be considered unsafe. They were immediately freed with Knox returning to her home in Seattle while Sollecito went back to Bisceglie on the southern Italian coast near Bari. Prosecutors in Perugia appealed the decision on behalf of Miss Kercher's family and will find out on Monday if they have been successful. They want the acquittal to be quashed and for a new trial to be held in neighbouring Tuscany. Neither are expected to attend the hearing which will be held behind closed doors in Rome. The case will decided purely on paperwork and legal documents with no new witnesses giving evidence. Luciano Ghirga, Knox's lawyer, said: 'She is very anxious about the hearing but she is waiting for it knowing full well that the outcome is very important.' Since returning to Seattle in the United States, Knox has kept a low profile although she is due to given an interview to ABC television on April 30 to coincide with the release of a book about her four years in an Italian jail. Emotional: Amanda Knox in tears after her conviction for murder was overturned in 2011 . Still in touch: Raffaele Sollecito said he and Knox are no longer lovers but still talk occasionally via Skype . Sollecito has also written a book and has already given an interview on Italian TV about the case where he said he and Knox were no longer lovers but they were still in touch - he visited her earlier this year and they speak on Skype regularly. He is now studying in Verona and they have always insisted they are innocent of Leeds University student Meredith's murder - she had only been in Italy for two months before she was killed having arrived from Coulsdon for a year long course as part of her degree. Last night his father Francesco said: 'He is working hard on his studies. He's working on a project involving the movement of surgical instruments during operations. He is calm and serene even if we are all in a state of apprehension.' During the investigation and trial much was made of Knox's character with prosecutors saying she was highly sexual and had manipulated Sollecito but her lawyers dismissed the theory. Rudy Guede is serving 16 years for the murder having initially being sentenced to 30 but this was later reduced on appeal. Due for release: Amanda Know will give her first TV interview to ABC in the U.S. on April 30 to coincide with the release of her memoir .

"By . Alex Greg for MailOnline . Two southwest Missouri residents posed for a selfie with the corpse of their deceased friend after he died of a drug overdose, say police. Chelsie Berry, 24, and Jared Prier, 28, have been charged with abandoning the corpse of Dennis Meyer, 30, whose body was found dumped on Route V last week. Berry and Prier were identified after the photograph was posted to Facebook. Selfie sabotage: Chelsie Berry (left) and Jared Prier (right) took a selfie with the corpse of their friend. The picture was posted to Facebook and eventually led to their arrest . Deceased: It's believed Meyer died of an overdose of the painkiller Dilaudid, but toxicology reports have not yet confirmed it . According to the arrest  report published by The Smoking Gun, Berry said she had been driving around with Meyer in his car. He decided to inject the painkiller Dilaudid as they sat in a McDonald's parking lot, after which he began acting 'crazy,' taking his penis out of his pants and saying 'strange things.' Berry became nervous so called Meyer's friend Jared Prier, whom she'd met the night before. By the time Prier arrived, Meyer had passed out, so Jared took the wheel and drove to Loves gas station where Berry went and bought a drink. When she returned, Prier informed her that he believed Meyer had 'quit breathing,' she told police. She checked Meyer and came to the same conclusion. Friends: Meyer (left) posted a series of pictures of himself and Prier (right), who have both been linked to a gang, captioned 'Me and my homie prier... I'd ride with him with or without a patch....' High on meth: Berry told police that she and Prier had taken meth and were too scared of getting in trouble with authorities to take Meyer to the hospital when he stopped breathing . Berry told police that she and Prier were high on meth and Xanax and were worried that if they took Meyer to hospital they'd 'get in trouble.' Instead, they dragged Meyer's body to the backseat because they no longer wanted to look at him and he had begun to smell - but not before posing for the selfie with their dead friend. The pair then drove around the back roads looking for somewhere to dump his body, eventually driving down a long driveway in the early hours of the morning and pushing his body to the ground. Newton County Sheriff Ken has said Meyer possibly died of a drug overdose. An autopsy has been performed, but authorities are waiting for a toxicology report. The autopsy concluded that Meyer would have died slowly and his breathing would have been very shallow - meaning if the pair had gotten him medical attention he might have survived. They have been charged with voluntary manslaughter and abandonment of a corpse. The Smoking Gun reports that Prier and Meyer are associated with the Joplin Honkies street gang.","Chelsie Berry, 24, and Jared Prier, 28, are charged with voluntary manslaughter and abandonment of a corpse .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 07:17 EST, 23 February 2012 . Subterfuge: Peter Gleick tricked a powerful thinktank into sending him confidential details of how they deny climate change . A respected U.S. scientist has admitted duping a powerful thinktank into sending him confidential details of how they deny climate change. Peter Gleick, president of the Pacific Institute, revealed in a blog post that he used a false name to get The Heartland Institute to send him the classified information. It included, he claimed, plans to create an 'anti-global warming science campaign for grade schools that will dissuade teachers from teaching science'. Heartland has labelled that document a 'forgery' and says it is now considering legal action against Gleick. But the environmental activist, who forwarded his finds to to campaigners and journalist, said he was angry with the way the organisation subverted the science for its own ends. The hydroclimatologist and author of the respected annual report The World's Water has now apologised for his 'serious lapse of my own professional judgment and ethics'. But he also added: 'My judgment was blinded by my frustration with the ongoing efforts - often anonymous, well-funded and co-ordinated - to attack climate science.' His actions have sparked a huge debate . as to whether he is a hero, for exposing the 'false science' of the . thinktank, or a villain for his subterfuge. Author and campaigner Naomi Klein said he should be sent 'some Twitter love'. Although she acknowledged he had breached scientific standards, she added that 'he took big risks to bring important truths about the deniers to light'. Scott Mandia, co-founder of the climate . science rapid response team, added: 'Peter Gleick, a scientist who is . also a journalist, just used the same tricks that any investigative . reporter uses to uncover the truth.  He is the hero and Heartland . remains the villain. He will have many people lining up to support him.' Scandal: It follows the leaking of thousands of documents, from the British University of East Anglia in 2009, which revealed how climate scientists were colluding with government officials to hide research that did not fit with their apocalyptic global warming line . At the beginning of 2012, I received an anonymous document in the mail describing what appeared to be details of the Heartland Institute's climate program strategy. It contained information about their funders and the Institute's apparent efforts to muddy public understanding about climate science and policy. I do not know the source of that original document but assumed it was sent to me because of my past exchanges with Heartland and because I was named in it. Given the potential impact, however, I attempted to confirm the accuracy of the information in this document. In an effort to do so, and in a serious lapse of my own professional judgment and ethics, I solicited and received additional materials directly from the Heartland Institute under someone else's name. The materials the Heartland Institute sent to me confirmed many of the facts in the original document, including especially their 2012 fundraising strategy and budget. I forwarded, anonymously, the documents I had received to a set of journalists and experts working on climate issues. I can explicitly confirm, as can the Heartland Institute, that the documents they emailed to me are identical to the documents that have been made public. I made no changes or alterations of any kind to any of the Heartland Institute documents or to the original anonymous communication. I will not comment on the substance or implications of the materials; others have and are doing so. I only note that the scientific understanding of the reality and risks of climate change is strong, compelling, and increasingly disturbing, and a rational public debate is desperately needed. My judgment was blinded by my frustration with the ongoing efforts - often anonymous, well-funded, and coordinated - to attack climate science and scientists and prevent this debate, and by the lack of transparency of the organizations involved. Nevertheless I deeply regret my own actions in this case. I offer my personal apologies to all those affected. * Source: The Huffington Post . But some scientists said he had done far more harm than good. Richard Klein, climate researcher at the Stockholm Environment Institute, told the Guardian: 'It's an own goal. It's not just his own credibility, his own integrity on the line. 'It's a whole community of climate scientists who, with the odd exception, want to do good science and make sure science is recognised. 'It doesn't just blur the line between climate science and science policy. 'It blurs the line between what are acceptable and what are not acceptable methods. 'He is not perceived by the outside world as acting in his personal capacity. 'He acted also by responding as Peter Gleick the scientist and of course that hurts other scientists as well.' His thoughts were echoed by John Nolt, professor of environmental ethics at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, who fears the anger over the way he obtained the information would take the focus away from climate change itself. He added that many of the revelations in the documents were already known. Gleick, who admitted his part in the scam after Heartland's financial plans and donor list was put online, has now decided not to take up a post on the National Centre for Science Education that would have seen him defending climate change in classrooms. But he could now face legal action, with Heartland President Joseph Bast saying he was now consulting experts on the breach. The scandal follows that which engulfed the University of East Anglia in 2009. Hackers accessed and the leaked online thousands of documents which revealed how climate scientists were colluding with government officials to hide research that did not fit with their apocalyptic global warming line. The files appeared to show the systematic suppression of evidence, and even publication of reports that scientists knew to to be based on flawed approaches. They painted a picture of scientists manipulating data, with government employees at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) also implicated. They also showed how scientists selectively used data, and colluded with politicians to misuse scientific information.

"By . Associated Press . In a letter sent to her mother in June 1931, 23-year-old Maine school-teacher Miriam McMichael apologizes for not writing sooner. The irony is, her mother would never receive the note. Eighty-three years later, both women are dead but the nine-page letter did find its way back to their family after being discovered in a Pittsfield, Massachusetts post office. The letter was finally delivered last month to Miriam McMichael's niece and recipient Dollena McMichael's granddaughter, 69-year-old Ann MacMichael of Cornville, Maine. Snail mail: Houlton, Maine school teacher Miriam McMichael sent this letter home to her mother, Dollena McMichael, in 1931. It was finally delivered last month, though both women have since died . Piece of history: In the letter, Miriam McMichael (left) apologized for not writing to her mother (right) sooner . The test of time: The nine-page letter was in remarkably good condition when post officials found it last month . 'One of the best parts for me of what she wrote was that she apologized for not writing sooner, as she knew her mother had been anxiously waiting all week for a letter — which, as we know, was never received,' Ann MacMichael told the Morning Sentinel. 'She said ""I’m just getting around to write. I imagine you have been anxiously waiting for a letter all week. I have no excuses, but that I just didn’t get to it and there are lots of things to tell you, too.""' Michelle Rowell was the Pittsfield post office clerk who discovered the letter, and said one detail made it really stick out. 'As I was sorting I came across it — it appeared to be old, but it was in really good condition,' Rowell said. 'It had a two-cent stamp on it. I knew it was old and the handwriting was old.' What happened? The letter was discovered by a post office clerk in Pittsfield, Massachusetts while sorting the morning mail. She reckons the letter slipped into sorting equipment where it lay hidden for decades . Lucky: It was a bit of a miracle that the letter was delivered since the family changed their last name from McMichael to MacMichael and moved to Skowhegan, Maine 40 years ago . She reckons the letter slipped 'neatly' into some old sorting equipment where it lay hidden over the decades. Knowing that the address would not be correct with modern practices, Rowell gave the letter to her postmaster. The postmaster then contacted the Pittsfield Fire Chief who knew the McMichaels moved to Showhegan 40  years ago, and changed their last name to MacMichael. Skowhegan postmaster Bill Sylvain hand delivered the letter to Red MacMichael, a retired lawyer and District Court judge, who then gave it to his sister Ann. Now Ms MacMichael is trying to solve the mystery of why the letter never got delivered. She hopes someone will read the news about the letter's resurfacing come forward to say 'I found it' and how.

The 27-year-old Canadian was jumping from 14,000ft when the lines on his parachute became entangled above Wilton, south west of Sydney. The quick-thinking skydiver was only able to save himself by 'cutting away' and deploying his reserve chute - just seconds before impact. Scroll down for video . A 27-year-old skydiver has captured the terrifying moment his parachute failed and sent him into a violent spin as he plummeted towards the ground near Sydney . The skydiver, who has jumped nearly 2,000 times before, said everything was running smoothly until he deployed the chute, which had been connected incorrectly, at about 3,000ft . 'Under normal circumstances it's not very difficult to cut-away your main parachute. However, this was far from a normal situation. Someone else had hooked half my gear up incorrectly and I missed it,' the Canadian, who did not want wish to be named, said. The skydiving instructor was jumping from a Sydney Skydivers plane during a routine jump in January when the incident unfolded, but only released the footage this week. 'Have you ever seen the Shawshank Redemption? Remember the scene when Tim Robbins climbs through a sewage pipe and comes out clean on the other side and he raises up his arms into the rain. Surviving this felt something like that,' he said. The Canadian was jumping from 14,000ft when the lines on his parachute became entangled above Wilton, south west of Sydney .

The skydiver, who has jumped nearly 2,000 times before, said everything was running smoothly until he deployed the Velocity 96 high-performance chute, which had been connected incorrectly, at about 3,000ft. Footage of the jump shows him going into a heavy spin as he tried to untangle the lines. He then made a snap decision to try and disconnect from the main parachute to deploy the reserve chute. All modern parachutes are fitted with a three-ring release system that allows for a rapid cut-away in the case of an emergency. The quick-thinking skydiver was only able to save himself by 'cutting away' and deploying his reserve - just seconds before impact . 'Everyone has jokingly been telling me for months that I was going to have a bad cutaway - so when it twisted up on me I thought “Now they're all going to laugh at me”,' he said. 'But I took my time, as you can see in the video, I worked out all the scenarios, and then fixed it before my time ran out.' But despite the frightening ordeal, the daredevil dusted himself off to complete two more jumps and said he had only been 'moderately' afraid. 'I did two jumps directly after,' he said. 'Two other people who saw the video left for the day.'

"By . Rebecca English Royal Correspondent . A future king sleeps peacefully in the arms of his doting mother in a family snapshot... taken by his grandfather. Previous royal heirs, Prince William included, have had their first official portraits taken by society legends such as Sir Cecil Beaton and Lord Snowdon. But Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge owes his to a humble ‘point and shoot’ wielded by Kate’s father, Michael Middleton. Scroll down for video . Sun and heir: Mr Middleton opted to shoot straight into the light for his snapshot of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and baby George, and managed to cut off the nose of retriever Tilly, left. The Cambridge's cocker spaniel Lupo, right, emerged unscathed . That's better: Mr Middleton's second photo produces much more appealing results, with the couple and their sleeping prince emerging from the blinding sunlight . And the setting? The Middletons’ sun-dappled back garden in Berkshire, with family pets Lupo and Tilly . even getting in on the act. The . finished result may have charm but is technically poor and lacks the . gravitas of previous official photographs, according to experts. Critics will also no doubt seize on Mr Middleton’s decision to break the cardinal rule of photography – shooting into the light. But according to celebrity photographer Brian Aris, the snapshots are ‘refreshing’. He told the Mail: ‘It’s an unusual decision but perhaps reflects the young approach that Prince William wants to bring to bear. ‘The . decision to take them in such an informal manner means they, perhaps, . lack the level of gravitas that would normally be expected. 'But on the whole I would say this is quite refreshing.’ The boy who will be king: Prince George in his mother's arms . He added: ‘Taking a professional portrait of a young baby is quite an intrusive procedure, given the lighting and strobes you would need. ‘So perhaps they have had the right idea after all. It’s just a different approach and the images are rather charming.’ Kensington Palace said the photographs . were taken with an inexpensive camera in early August while the Duke . and Duchess of Cambridge were staying with internet millionaires Carole . and Michael Middleton at their £4.8million Berkshire mansion. Both . photos show the couple posing with George, who is swaddled in the same . shawl by Nottinghamshire firm G H Hurt and Son Ltd that he left hospital . in. Was THIS the maestro's first effort? Mr Middleton, left, took this photo of wife Carole and daughter Kate in 1982 (right) Similar: Mr Middleton's pictures of the Royals on the grass in his Berkshire garden echo those of the young Prince William taken in the grounds of Government House in Auckland, New Zealand . Kate is wearing a £46 fuchsia-coloured knot front dress by maternity wear firm Seraphine, but appears to have shed a great deal of her baby weight. William is casually dressed in a blue checked shirt, tucked into jeans, and his favourite African-style belt. Both look a little baggy-eyed due to lack of sleep – the prince more than his wife – but are clearly overjoyed at being parents to a beautiful, healthy baby boy. Given the illustrious history of royal family portraits, the Cambridges' decision to use one of proud grandpa Mike's happy family snaps is a startling break with tradition. According to well-placed sources, the decision was very much William’s and Kate’s. It is understood the couple were keen . ‘not to burst the happy little family bubble’ they have existed in at . the Middleton family home since George’s birth. First shots: Mr Middleton's images are the first pictures of the young Royals since Prince George was introduced to the world outside St Mary's Hospital last month . ‘They . are a young couple who have just had their first baby and are enjoying . time as a family together but, of course, there has been huge demand . from the public to see some official photographs of Prince George,’ said . an aide. ‘It seemed . perfectly natural to them to pose for a few nice family snapshots which . they could then issue. It [the Middleton family home] is just where they . feel happy and most comfortable.’ The . Mail also understands the couple were keen to take the wind out of the . sails of the huge international market for unofficial paparazzi pictures . of George by releasing their own as soon as possible. The first official portrait of Prince Charles is a study in royal portraiture. Taken . by legendary English photographer, Sir Cecil Beaton, the image of the . Queen gazing at her son was shot at Buckingham Palace in December 1948 . when he was just a month old. Fast-forward . more than 30 years, and a startled-looking Prince William is introduced . to the world by the Queen’s brother-in-law Lord Snowdon, another . celebrated photographer. Traditional: Cecil Beaton's 1948 photo of Prince Charles (left) and the formal portrait of Prince William and his parents (right) by Lord Snowdon in 1982 . Although . more relaxed, the photo is still a formal portrait of a future king, . proudly showing off the next generation of the family line. The . Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s decision to use one of Mike Middleton’s . happy family snaps is thus a substantial break with tradition. According . to sources, the decision was very much William and Kate’s. ‘It’s where . they feel happy and most comfortable,’ said an aide. They went on to explain that the pictures were a mark of thanks for the privacy they had been given after the birth. ‘They asked the media to give them some time as a family and the British media have done that,’ they said. Kate Middleton’s father ignored photography advice on his own website when he took the first snaps of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with Prince George. The Party Pieces website tells amateur photographers to ensure ‘natural light is behind you’ when taking pictures at family occasions. But in his images of the couple with the newborn prince, Mr Middleton pictured them with the sun behind them, casting their faces into shadow. Other advice on the site includes dressing children so their outfits don’t clash and using ‘toilet humour’ to make them laugh. As the photographer, Michael Middleton is automatically entitled to copyright of the image under the Copyright Designs and Patents Act. But last night it emerged that he has already handed over ownership of the pictures. This means he won’t be entitled to any money when they are printed – and Kate and William will be able to control their use.","Michael Middleton took the official portrait at their family home in Berkshire and even included dogs Lupo and Tilly .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Hiding his faith? Scholars have offered a fascinating theory about the true religion of Christopher Columbus . He was an intrepid explorer, heroically leading his crew into the unknown as he set sail for the New World on a voyage of discovery. His legend might be cemented in history as the man who discovered America, but a remarkable new theory has emerged about Christopher Columbus and why he embarked on his momentous voyage of 1492. On the day marking the 508th anniversary of the explorer's death, scholars have claimed there is compelling evidence that suggests Christopher Columbus was secretly Jewish and that he hid his true faith to survive the Spanish Inquisition. In a further revelation, historians believe the real motive behind his historic quest was to find a new homeland for Jews who were persecuted and run out of Spain. As well as his legendary status as an explorer, Columbus has been described as a deeply religious man who was committed to the cause of liberating Jerusalem from the Muslims. Jews were the target of a brutal and systematic ethnic cleansing during the lifetime of Columbus. As part of fanatical, religious persecution it was proclaimed by Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand in March 1492 that all Jews should be expelled from Spain. This move was particularly aimed at the 800,000 Jews who refused to convert to Catholicism and were given just four months to leave the country. The remaining Jews in Spain fell into two groups: The 'Conversos' - converts who embraced Catholicism and renounced Judaism - and the 'Marranos', meaning swine, who feigned conversion but secretly continued with their own religious practices. In search of a safe haven? An illustration of Christopher Columbus setting foot on American soil for the first time... but was he looking for a new Jewish homeland? Question of faith: The Spanish Inquisition tortured tens of thousands of Marranos, who were ordered to give up the names of others - including friends and relatives . The Spanish Inquisition tortured tens of thousands of Marranos, who were ordered to give up the names of others - including friends and relatives. Marranos who had their secret lives exposed were paraded in front of crowds, tied to stakes and burned alive while the crown and the church divided and took their land and personal possessions. It has been claimed that Columbus was a Marrano and that keeping his Jewish heritage secret was crucial to his survival. The scholars believe he left intriguing clues to his true religious background when he died, CNN reported. Five provisions discovered in Columbus's last will and testament, signed by the explorer on May 19, 1506, point to him being Jewish, the scholars argue. Firstly, he left one tenth of his income to the poor and outlined another wish that an anonymous dowry be provided for girls with no money - both of which are part of Jewish customs. Map showing the voyages of Christopher Columbus and fellow explorer John Cabot: The expedition is said to have been funded not by Queen Isabella of Spain, but by three prominent Jews . The Holy Land: Columbus has been described as a deeply religious man who was committed to the liberation of Jerusalem in Israel . Historians say there are a number of intriguing hints that point towards Columbus being Jewish. Two provisions made in his will were Jewish customs: To leave one tenth of his income to the poor and providing an anonymous dowry for girls with no money. He left an undisclosed amount supporting the crusade of liberating the Holy Land. He also gave funds to a Jew living at the entrance of the Lisbon Jewish Quarter. He instructed his heirs to use a triangular signature made up of dots and letters, mimicking a Jewish prayer. His famous voyage was funded not by the Queen of Spain, but by three prominent Jews - and it was them who he updated first on the progress of his quest. He also left an undisclosed amount of money to support the crusade of liberating the Holy Land, as well as leaving funds to a Jew who lived at the entrance of the Lisbon Jewish Quarter. Perhaps the most intriguing clues are within Columbus's signature itself, the scholars claim. The explorer used a series of dots and letters - formed in a triangular shape - resembling inscriptions found on gravestones of Jewish cemeteries in Spain, which he ordered his heirs to use. It is believed by one British historian - Cecil Roth, the author of A History of the Marranos - that the signature cryptically replicated a Jewish prayer, the Kaddish, which is usually recited in a synagogue by people mourning the death of a close family member. This would have allowed Columbus's sons to say Kaddish for their father after his death, it is claimed. Another historian, Simon Weisenthat, claimed in his book Sails of Hope that the motive behind Columbus's voyage was to find a homeland and safe haven for the Jews following their expulsion from Spain. The scholars say that, contrary to popular belief, the expedition was not funded by Queen Isabella, but by three prominent Jews who all stumped up 17,000 ducats, CNN reports. This theory is supported, they say, by the emergence of the first two letters written by Columbus, which were sent to his 'backers' instead of the royal couple, revealing what he had found and thanking them for his support.","Scholars believe Columbus was a 'Marrano', a secret Jew who feigned conversion to Catholicism .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and Arthur Martin . and Lucy Osborne . A man has been accused of murdering two vulnerable pensioners who lived 120 miles apart. Leo Barnes, 32, is suspected of killing 80-year-old Cynthia Beamond and Philip Silverstone, 67. The bodies of the victims, who are not related, were found within 24 hours of each other in the West Midlands and London. In the dock: Chantelle Moran-Stokes appeared in court alongside her boyfriend Leo Barnes . Yesterday, Barnes appeared before magistrates accused of double murder. In the dock alongside him was his girlfriend, Chantelle Moran-Stokes, 24, who is accused of murdering Mrs Beamond. The . glamorous blonde sat just a foot from her partner but stared straight . ahead without acknowledging him during the brief hearing. Friends . said Barnes is well-known for driving a Porsche and for his love of . powerful cars. Murder: The body of Cynthia Beamond,  80, left, was found hidden inside her  house in Halesowen on Sunday and Moran-Stokes, right, is accused of taking part . He has posted numerous pictures of garishly-painted . supercars on his Facebook, alongside images of luxury brands and London . landmarks. His girlfriend has posted dozens of pictures of herself online posing with friends at Birmingham nightclubs. The . police investigation began when worried family members reported Mrs . Beamond missing in Halesowen, West Midlands, last Friday. The grandmother-of-two’s battered body was eventually discovered concealed inside the semi-detached property on Sunday evening. Crime scene: Police at the house in Juliet Road, Halesowen, West Midlands, where the body of Cynthia Beamond was found . A post mortem examination found the widow, who has two daughters, died from head injuries inflicted during a vicious attack. Mrs . Beamond’s T-registration Vauxhall Astra was later found abandoned in . the Druids Heath area of Birmingham after a tip-off from a member of the . public. Meanwhile, police . in London found Mr Silverstone’s body at his flat in Belsize Park, North . West London, on Monday morning after being alerted by relatives. The . former market trader had suffered a number of stab wounds at Spencer . House, which is in a warden-controlled block for the elderly. Investigators believe he was murdered around midnight on Saturday. They . originally arrested his second wife Mary, who is in poor health and in a . wheelchair, but quickly released her without charge. She is more than . 15 years older than him. Killing: Barnes is also accused of murdering Philip Silverstone in Belsize Park, north London on Monday . Detectives . are investigating whether Mrs Silverstone witnessed the murder of her . husband of 36 years in their top-floor flat at the four-storey Georgian . townhouse. Neighbours described Mr Silverstone as a ‘gentle’ man and a ‘Del Boy character’, who was devoted to his wife. Barnes, a father-of-one, and Moran-Stokes were arrested on Sunday morning by West Midlands Police murder squad detectives. Barnes was questioned over the London murder on Tuesday evening after Metropolitan Police detectives discovered a link. According to housing records, he is a former neighbour of Mr Silverstone and lived in the same block for several years. The unusual circumstances have led West Midlands Police and the Met to form a joint investigation. Self-employed Barnes, of Balsall Heath, Birmingham, appeared at Dudley Magistrates’ Court yesterday. Wearing a black T-shirt, he refused to give or confirm his name, address and date of birth to the court clerk. Moran-Stokes, . of Darlaston, West Midlands, spoke only to confirm her name, address . and date of birth during the five-minute hearing. The pair were remanded in custody and ordered to appear at Wolverhampton Crown Court today.

"By . Ian Drury . It was a top secret command centre set up by Winston Churchill to defend London from German aircraft during the Second World War. Deep inside Brompton Road Underground station, the Royal Artillery ran its anti-aircraft operations room tasked with blasting enemy bombers from the skies in the Blitz. The bunker is also thought to be where Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy in the Nazi Party, was brought to be interrogated after being captured in Scotland in 1941. Scroll down for video tour of the station . The disused London Underground Brompton Road Station contains a drill hall, garages, offices and mess as well as underground rooms, staircases and tunnels . Landmark: The building features the oxblood-red tiled facade and semi-circular windows typical of architect Leslie Green's style . But now the Ministry of Defence is selling off the 28,000 sq ft 'ghost station' in a bid to raise up to £60million for frontline troops. The property at 206 Brompton Road in central London is currently occupied by the London University Air Squadron, the London University Royal Naval Unit and 46F Squadron Air Training Corps. The property - close to the world-famous Harrods department store in Knightsbridge - contains a drill hall, garages, offices and mess as well as underground rooms, staircases and tunnels that were part of the former Brompton Road Underground. The Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO), responsible for the management and maintenance of Ministry of Defence land and property, is selling the building having deemed it 'surplus to military requirement'. Footage courtesy of The Old London Underground Company . Ghost station: The historic 28,000 sq ft building is being sold off by the MoD in a bid to help raise £60m for frontline troops . Spooky: The passages where commuters would have made their way to platforms in the early 20th century remain today . Leslie Green: Brompton Road was one of a number of Tube stations designed by the English architect, who favoured the Arts and Crafts style . Remains: Switch gear used during the building's days as an Underground station still remain today . Developers have expressed interest in turning the Tube station into a tourist attraction with restaurants and bars. Brompton . Road Tube opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton . Railway (GNP&BR) on the Piccadilly Line, positioned between . Knightsbridge and South Kensington. The . building was designed by English architect Leslie Green and features . his distinctive oxblood-red tiled facade and semi-circular first floor . windows. New life: 'Boris bikes' are seen lined up outside the Leslie Green-designed station in Knightsbridge as it looks today . Historic links: The former Underground station and WWII command centre could be transformed into a tourist attraction . Distinctive: The green interior tiles remain inside the Leslie Green-designed station today . Eerie: A bricked off tunnel deep beneath the ground at the old Brompton Road Tube station . Varied past: The building is currently occupied by the London University Air Squadron, the London University Royal Naval Unit, and 46F Squadron Air Training Corps . Danger: Brompton Road ceased to be used as a tube station in 1934 . On the market: The MoD is hoping the former Tube station will fetch an eight figure sum when it is marketed by agents Jones Lang LaSalle in September . Safety measures: A metal fire escape at the old Underground station on London's Brompton Road . London's hidden network: Warning notices hang inside Brompton Road station in central London . Warnings: Everything at track and platform level at Brompton Road remains in the ownership of Transport for London, which has no involvement in the sale of the building . War years: The Royal Artillery ran its anti-aircraft operations room from Brompton Road during the Second World War . Located at the junction of Brompton . Road and Cottage Place, the station was convenient for the Victoria . & Albert Museum and the Brompton Oratory, but still saw little . traffic. It was permanently closed in 1934 . after it was finally deemed to be too close to the neighbouring stations . to be economically viable. The station was taken over by the War Office to be used as a command centre for the defence of London. Not viable: The station was conveniently located for Brompton Oratory (pictured), but did not see a lot of traffic through its doors . Attractions: Brompton Road was also close to the Victoria & Albert Museum (pictured), and Harrods, but was closed permanently as a station in 1934 because it was too close to neighbouring Tube stops . War effort: Developers keen to capitalise on the station's links to Churchill have previously expressed an interest in transforming it into a tourist attraction . It was from here that the gun batteries dotted around London were coordinated as they tried to shoot down enemy planes during World War Two. There are understood to be 32 ghost stations across London's underground network, abandoned over the years as lines were diverted or the number of passengers passing through dwindled. Like Brompton Road, many of the stations have links to the Second World War. Down Street - last used as a station in May 1932, became an air raid shelter after the war broke out, and Aldwych was used by thousands of Londoners during the Blitz. The empty station in Westminster has been used as a location for films including Atonement, V for Vendetta, Superman 4 and 28 Weeks Later. Other abandoned stations still remain at City Road, which was on the Northern Line until it closed its doors in 1922, Marlborough Road, which was on the Metropolitan Line, and South Kentish Town, which closed in 1924. York Road closed in 1932 because it was under-used, while North End is unique in that it is a closed Tube station that never actually opened. Intended to be the deepest station on the underground network, work on North End stopped in 1906 because it was not deemed financially viable. Churchill is believed to have visited the command centre to watch over the command of the battle against the Luftwaffe. It was vacated by the War Office in the 1950s but seventy years on the Ministry of Defence still owns it to a depth of about 60ft underground. The MoD’s jurisdiction ends at a locked gate and beyond this Tube trains still run on the Piccadilly Line. But evidence of the Royal Artillery's operations centre remains in remarkable condition. Maps of London still hang from the walls of the war room. The station retains period features including a distinctive brown and green tiling pattern and electrical switch gear. The Old London Underground Company, which seeks to turn the city's disused train stations into leisure or tourist attractions, has bid for the building. Founder Aljit Chambers said the Qatari royal family - which owns nearby Harrods - had also expressed an interest in buying the building. John Taylor, estates surveyor for DIO, said: 'The MOD keeps the size and location of its bases under constant review to ensure the defence estate is no larger than necessary to meet operational needs and provides value for money for the taxpayer.' The station is due to be marketed by an agent from September. Simon Hodson, of Jones Lang LaSalle estate agents, which is marketing the building on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, said the disused station was likely to attract a 'high level' of interest from a variety of potential buyers. 'This site provides an excellent redevelopment opportunity and we are expecting a high level of interest from a variety of purchasers when we bring this to the market in September,' he said.

"By . Lydia Warren . A 30-year-old cancer sufferer will finally marry her boyfriend of nearly 10 years this weekend after waiting until now because marriage would have affected her health insurance. Jennifer Hutcheson, from Flint, Michigan, will wed 49-year-old Allen Korth on Sunday with the help of a charity, Wish Upon A Wedding. Although the couple have long been engaged, she did not want to walk down the aisle because marriage would cause her to lose her insurance benefits and see the costs of a plan soar. But in February, she entered hospice care meaning that 100 per cent of her end of life care will be covered by her insurance company - which also means that the couple can finally marry. Final wish: Jennifer Hutcheson, 30, who has cancer of the esophagus, will marry Allen Korth, 49, on Sunday . 'When . there's something you've always wanted and you're faced with death... it kind of brings peace to you,' she told MLive. 'There's something about changing your . last name to the person you love. It's just important to me that I get . to do that.' The non-profit organization, as well and family and friends, have swooped in to plan the wedding in just three weeks, helping Hutcheson select her dress and a brown curly wig for the occasion. 'It's kind . of surreal, emotional,' she said. 'It's going to be better than I . thought it would be. Being able to afford a wedding on its own . would be hard to do at this time for us. It wouldn't have been done.' The couple met through work just before Hutcheson turned 21, quickly became friends and soon started dating. But when she was 25, her family noticed she was losing weight. She went to the doctor and discovered she had a tumor in her esophagus. They later found the cancer had spread to her stomach and ovaries, causing her to undergo a hysterectomy. In February 2010, she was given less than a year to live. Fighter: Hutcheson was diagnosed with cancer when she was 25 and has been in remission multiple times but in February she was given just two to six months to live. Two months ago, she entered hospice care . 'I fought and fought and fought for the time that I had,' Hutcheson said. 'Somehow, my body started to get better.' But the cancer returned, this time attacking her liver. Again she battled it, but by November 2013, it had returned to her esophagus and new cancer was also found in her stomach, her intestines, her liver, gall bladder and her pancreas. In total, she battled through seven rounds of chemotherapy and three rounds of radiation but in February, she was given just two to six months to live. She now weighs just 88 pounds but hopes she'll be able to walk down the aisle without using her wheelchair - and she can't wait to see what her husband-to-be thinks of her look. 'I'm really excited to get his reaction,' she said. 'I look healthy with everything together, the makeup people and the hair people. I have a nice wig and the dress. You get to feel good.' Korth told Mlive he is excited to celebrate with his new bride on Sunday. 'She . is a happy, happy person,' he said. 'She is completely genuine. She has never, . ever been who she's not. Not even once.' Fight: Since she was 25, Jennifer has suffered cancer of the esophagus, liver, stomach, ovaries, gall bladder and pancreas. She has undergone seven rounds of chemotherapy - but still remains smiling . Early days: The couple is pictured in their first photo together in 2005. Jennifer is now just 88 pounds . She added: 'He . just treats me well and (he's) able to be the rock I need when things . fall apart for me, hold me together when I'm falling apart. He stood by me even when I told him he didn't have to. 'We don't . spend a lot of time thinking about cancer. We spend more time talking . about politics and silly stuff and he makes funny cartoon (voices). We . just have a good time and he keeps me laughing. It's worth it.' The couple's wedding will be the third hosted by Wish Upon a Wedding in Michigan since 2011. It provides weddings and vow renewals to couples facing terminal illness and serious life-changing circumstances. Hutcheson said she wishes she could join the team to help people the same way she's been helped through the process.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . A new study and the latest California gubernatorial debate shined new light on the prominence of illegal immigrants in the state's economy, workforce and schools in the same week President Barack Obama delayed action on the issue. Researchers at the University of Southern California found that illegal immigrants in the US state with the biggest economy make up nearly 10 per cent of the workforce and contribute $130billion annually to its gross domestic product. And on Thursday, Governor Jerry Brown said about 30 per cent of California students are undocumented or don't speak English, according to a C-SPAN transcript of the event. Katheryn Varela, 13, center, spends a moment with her thoughts while shopping for groceries with her sister Dayana, 9, left, and mother Silvia Padilla, right, in Los Angeles. The sisters, hoping to receive political asylum in the US after fleeing their home in Honduras, are among the estimated 2.6 million undocumented mmigrants in California . California Governor Jerry Brown said in Thursday's gubernatorial debate that about 30 per cent of students in the state are undocumented or can't speak English . The figures come as President Obama drew a mixture of disappointment and ridicule for postponing promised executive orders on immigration reform until after the midterm elections. Obama in June had vowed to sidestep a gridlocked Congress on the issue and take action  by the end of summer. White House officials said he changed his mind after concluding that circumventing Congress through executive actions during the campaign would politicize the issue and hurt future efforts to pass a broad overhaul. Obama's decision to delay plans to act on immigration reform infuriated those who have long urged the president to modify his deportation policies . The new figures, however, may push the issue back onto the agenda. The USC study tried to assess the impact of California's estimated 2.6 million living in the state without permission and shows how integrated they are in everyday life, the Los Angeles Times reported. Other key findings from the report include: . 'It's a population deeply embedded in the labor market, neighborhoods and social fabric of the state,' USC sociology professor Manuel Pastor, who worked on the report, told the Los Angeles Times. Advocates for more inclusive immigration policy argue immigrants' economic contributions add to the reasons they should be allowed to stay.

'A bigger economy doesn't mean the people are richer,' said Steven Camarot, of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter restrictions on immigration.

"By . Rob Cooper . Updated: . 01:49 EST, 26 August 2011 . Amed Pelle, 18, used Facebook to incite violence . A teenager who used Facebook to encourage the 'killing of a million police officers' during the riots has been jailed for 33 months. Amed Pelle incited his 2,000 friends on the site to commit violence and looting in Nottingham. He asked if any of them 'wanted anything' from a fashion store that was later targeted. The jobless 18-year-old posted three messages on his Facebook 'wall' on August 9, hours before serious disorder broke out in his home city. The first two read 'Nottz Riot whose onit?' and 'Kill one black youth, we kill a million Fedz (police), riot til we own cities'. It is believed the second message was a reference to Mark Duggan, whose death in Tottenham sparked the original trouble. In his third message, Pelle wrote: 'Rioting 2nyt anyone want anything from (fashion chain) Flannels?' The store, in Nottingham city centre, had its windows smashed hours later. Pelle had pleaded guilty to a breach of section 44 of the Serious Crime Act 2007, doing an act which was capable of encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence, namely violent disorder. Judge John Milmo told Pelle that his comments 'encouraged attacks on the people of Nottingham as a whole, and the people of other cities.' Sentencing the teenager to two years and nine months in a young offenders' institution, he added: 'Your offence was designed to, and could well have led to, increased numbers on the street intent on violence to persons and property. 'An element of deterrence is called for in cases like this. A clear signal needs to be sent out that criminal conduct of the kind demonstrated in these cases is out of order and will not be brushed under the carpet.' Ice cream thief: Anderson Fernandes, 21, was jailed - despite giving away his ice cream after just one lick . His sentence came as a looter who took just one lick of an ice cream he stole during rioting before he gave it away was jailed for 16 months. Anderson Fernandes, 21, wandered into an upmarket store in central Manchester after the door was left open and helped himself to a cone and two scoops. But despite giving it to a passer-by because he didn't like the coffee flavour he was still given a lengthy prison term. The sentence will fuel fears that courts are meting out disproportionate justice to those caught up in the disorder. Callum Marley, 20, was also locked up for 16 months in Manchester despite stealing nothing from a looted store. He crawled under ransacked shutters at a Cash Generator pawnbrokers yet left empty handed when he found nothing worth taking - because everything had been taken already. Figures last week showed that rioters were getting sentences which were '40 per cent longer' than people found guilty of equivalent offences. As the clampdown continues, Scotland Yard revealed today that over 2,000 people have been held in connection with rioting in London. Yesterday Manchester Crown Court was told that ice cream thief Fernandes, 21, was arrested after raiding Patisserie Valerie because he left DNA behind at the scene. He admitted burglary and an unconnected charge of handling a stolen vacuum cleaner after his arrest. Upmarket shop: Fernandes walked into this Patisserie Valerie in Manchester and helped himself to a cone and two scoops of ice cream . The court heard that Fernandes had already appeared in court charged with possessing drugs and an offensive weapon on the same day he got mixed up in the disorder. Michael McQuillan, defending, said: 'He is remorseful and fully accepts how serious the matter was and why courts take such a serious view of this type of behaviour. Jailed: Callum Marley, 21, left, was jailed for 16 months despite having taken nothing from a pawnbrokers. Amateur footballer Fabrice Bembo-Leta, 19, right, was also jailed after looting a footwear store . A looter was picked out from a mob because he was wearing a distinctive Batman jumper, a court heard. Benjamin King, 20, was jailed for 16 months after admitting burglary from a central Manchester clothes store. He took a . rucksack and another branded bag - . handing one of them over to a looter who couldn't carry what he had . stolen. Adrian Palmer, defending, told Manchester Crown Court the defendant had gone into the city centre with 'inquisitive rather than malicious' intent, and had made no attempt to evade responsibility for the . 'wrongdoing' which followed. Judge Michael Henshell, sentencing, said: . 'The cases we have heard today illustrate this with perfect clarity. Items as trivial as ice cream cones, handbags and T-shirts. 'Looked at in . isolation the theft or handling of property such as this could be . described as low-level offending. 'However, crowds are composed of . individuals playing a part, large or small. This results in others being . drawn in and becoming part of the general offending, thereby making the . situation worse.' 'It's not the fact of the offence he committed, it's the fact he's committed it in circumstances where there's public disorder.' Fernandes, from Newton Heath, was among a group of young men who appeared at Manchester Crown Court yesterday charged over the riots. The court was told that Marley, who fled a Cash Generator store empty-handed, was caught after cutting himself on glass as he tried to find something worth taking. Andrew Evans, defending, said: . 'He stood and watched for about ten minutes as people left the store . with all sorts of electrical items and went in in the same amoral, . unthinking manner in which people in a mob do. 'He clambered in, cut . himself on the glass. He'd left it far too late - he left with nothing.' A man who was so drunk he forgot he had been on a riot was jailed for two years at the same court. Dean Millers, 21, from Salford, left a fingerprint on a camera case at Jessops in central Manchester and blood on a cigarette cupboard. Paul Lamb, defending, said: 'He can't recall handling . the camera box, but accepts he entered the premises and entered to . steal, although he did not carry out the theft itself. 'He can't recall . taking cigarettes but accepts he may well have done so.' Also jailed was an amateur footballer who smashed his way into a shoe store with an iron bar. Stalybridge Celtic player Fabrice Bembo-Leta, 19, lost his place in the squad after raiding the Foot Asylum outlet in central Manchester. After getting into the store he grabbed . five T-shirts, dropped two, and stashed three in a nearby plant pot. The churchgoer . abandoned them after police approached, but was linked to his crime by . CCTV. Tough sentences: Lengthy jail terms were handed out at Manchester Crown Court to looters - including ice cream thief Anderson Fernandes, 21, and Callum Marley, 21, who was sent to prison despite having stolen nothing . Bembo-Leta, who has also played for Oldham and Altrincham FC's youth teams, had no previous convictions. He was jailed for 32 months after admitting burglary. Michael Brady, defending, said: 'He's . not a young man known to police who knew it would be inevitable that he . would be identified, neither is it the situation that he was under any . pressure from family to surrender. 'This was very much a decision taken . by a remarkably mature 19-year-old, probably a reflection not only on . him but also his family and the way he has been brought up.' A teenager who hoped to become a famous actor was also jailed after looting a Sainsbury's store in central Manchester. Drama student Joshua Penney, 17, told a judge he 'felt like scum' after raiding the store. Michael Fairhead, also 17, was also detained after he was collared in the early hours, carrying two stolen bottles of gin. Both had come into Manchester that night out of 'curiosity', the court heard. Penney was given an eight-month detention and training order after stealing cigarettes and will serve half in a young offenders' institution. When District Judge Jonathan Taaffe asked . him how he felt after seeing news coverage of the devastation, Penney . replied: 'It made me feel like I was scum. 'The things that happened . made me feel so little and worthless.' The defendant, who has no . previous convictions, added: 'I hope to become an actor. A very . successful actor.' Fairhead, who admitted handling stolen goods, was jailed for eight months. The teenagers can both be named because reporting restrictions were lifted as the judge ruled naming them was in the public interest.","Another rioter who found nothing left worth stealing in camera store is also locked up for 16 months .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . A group of California children are protesting the removal of a beloved neighborhood alligator taken away by state fish and wildlife authorities. Though some may consider a 125 pound alligator intimidating, the children in Rancho Cucamonga say that they don't feel right without the creature, named Chopper, penned on neighbor Chris Cassaro's property. 'We just really want her back, so bad that it's not even funny,' said neighbor Braden Zazueta. Roughly a dozen California children and parents held a sit-in to get alligator 'Chopper' back Friday . At 125 pounds, Chopper has lived with her owner in the neighborhood since 1987 . They rallied on behalf of Cassaro's pet's return with signs reading 'Bring Chopper Home' and 'Bring Back Our Gator.' Roughly a dozen neighbors held a sit-in to get Chopper back Friday. Parents at the demonstration said Chopper gave their children an experience no other neighborhood could replicate. 'Most children go their whole lives without that opportunity, our neighborhood's been blessed. So to have her taken from us, it's a complete betrayal, in a sense, to our whole entire neighborhood,' Amber Parks told reporters. Chopper had been on Cassaro's property since 1987. 'I never had children,' he told KTLA. 'She is my child.' Owner Chris Cassaro says Chopper is the closest he has to a child . California Department of Fish and Wildlife officials took Chopper and two venomous snakes from Cassaro on Thursday. They told him it was not legal to own the animals. Cassaro said he had a permit and did everything he could to make sure he was caring for Chopper legally. 'I worked with the city of Rancho Cucamonga for almost a year, jumping through their hoops, doing their conditions, getting my neighbors in agreement,' he told reporters. Officials said he was unable to find that permit when they came for Chopper, but even if Cassaro had produced it they still would have removed the animals. California lists alligators as restricted animals and said Cassaro failed to have a special state permit for Chopper . California has alligators on its list of restricted species and would need a special state license to keep her. As he did not have one, he would likely never be able to keep Chopper again. Cassaro's neighbors are sympathetic. 'She's been living here 30 years, I think she should live here 30 more because it's just her home. Everybody has grown to know her and love her,' said Hunter Oslund.","Sleep-in drew dozens of children and parents who missed 'Chopper'

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . It sounds like an excuse a flustered groom might make after forgetting to order the wedding cake. But newlyweds Matt, 35, and Kelly Gamblin, 32, had to make do with a consolation cake from a nearby supermarket after a dog ate theirs. When they arrived at the marquee for their wedding reception at Skipwith Hall, Yorkshire, they found their beautiful red velvet cake had been demolished. The red velvet wedding cake had been lovingly made by the bride's grandfather, Richard Varley . Newlyweds Matt, 35, and Kelly Gamblin, 32, had to make do with a consolation cake after a dog ate theirs . It had been lovingly made by the bride's grandfather, Richard Varley. Initially the couple, who were together for five years before tying the knot at York Register Office, thought it had been damaged in transit. But a trail of muddy paw prints across the dance floor alerted the couple that there could have been a canine thief. Caterers then told the couple that they had had to shoo animals away from the tent earlier on in the day. Mr Gamblin said: 'It was quite upsetting - we just couldn't understand what had happened. 'When Richard showed us, I just thought it hadn't travelled well. The couple married at York Register Office and held their reception at Skipwith Hall, Yorkshire . 'When he told me it had, we noticed the muddy paw prints on our dance floor and knew something had got it. 'Then we saw the dog hairs all over the remaining half and it was quite clear. 'It didn't ruin our big day but we were gutted, as was Richard. 'There was probably someone who saw their pet with its face covered in icing and chocolate so they probably knows which dog it is. 'Kelly's mum pointed out that the cake would probably not have agreed with the canine thief.' The couple are not sure exactly which dog ate the cake, as the thief had already disappeared. But one of Mr Gamblin's friends said he had seen a black Labrador sniffing around. There was a field out of the back of the marquee, so it is thought the culprit came from there.","Matt and Kelly Gamblin's red velvet wedding cake was demolished by a dog .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Mr Nasty: Marcello Marino keeps getting death threats because he was rude on Come Dine With Me. Pictured with his wife, Yaice . A Come Dine With Me contestant who gets death threats every time his episodes air has begged Channel 4 bosses to stop repeating the show. Marcello Marino, a 44-year-old hairdresser, became an instant hate figure when he launched attacks on the other four contestants in 2011 - but has been plagued with abuse ever since. Marino slated his rivals' appearances, telling Donna Grieve she looked like she had never taken a bath and that her main course of cod, mozarella and tomatoes 'looked like a sick bag'. He insulted Chris Newbold's haircut, told Lydia Jones she looked a 'state' and told balding male contestant Anthony Wait he should 'wear a wig' and that he looked 'like a transvestite'. Although he is recognised as one of the rudest contestants to ever grace the show, the messages he has received as a result have been far more vicious. Livid viewers have told the father-of-three they want to punch him to death or break his legs, hope his salon has to close and called him a 'slimy toad'. He has received thousands of hate messages in total - in the post, via text messages and on Twitter - and the threats have got so bad that he and his wife Yaice, 31, have had to call the police. One message, sent to him on Facebook, warned: 'If I see you in the street I'm going to punch you until you are lying on the ground.' An an anonymous text read: 'You are a cretin. I'd love to see you dead - you really are a slimy toad and if I ever see you in the street I'll sort you out.' Marino said: 'I know I came across as rude but I don't deserve this every time it's on again. Scroll down for video . Not quite the perfect host: Fellow contestant took offence at many of Marino's remarks towards them . 'It's very upsetting to get so many people say they will kill me or break my legs. It's unbelievable people get so upset over a TV show.' Marino's show was last aired 10 days ago, and he had to make another call to Kent Police, who have given him a crime reference number. He believes the show has been repeated 'about 10 times' in total. Come Dine With Me frequently gets more than two million viewers, and Marino has asked that they stop showing his episode. Marino told Donna Grieve (left) she looked like she had never taken a bath, insulted Chris Newbold's haircut (centre) and told Lydia Jones (right) that she looked a 'state' Begging: Marino has asked Channel 4 to stop repeating the show as he fears for his life . 'What will it take for them to stop showing the programme?' he said. 'Do I have to have my legs broken and end up in hospital - or even worse? 'The threats have been going on since January 2011 and every time the show is repeated I get new ones. 'I didn't sign up to this and I just want them to stop repeating the shows I was in. 'Every time it's on I go out and am always looking over my shoulder. 'I asked C4 to stop putting it on because one day I'll be killed and it will be the show's fault.' The channel appears to have no plans to do so however, with a spokesman saying: 'We were saddened to hear Marcello had been receiving threats as he was a great contributor on Come Dine with Me which is a fun and light-hearted show. 'The programme makers have been in touch with Marcello to offer support and advice and both we and the programme makers would urge any contributor receiving threats to contact the police immediately.' Marino, from Ramsgate, Kent, came last in the dinner party competition, after receiving 26 out of a possible 40 points from his dinner guests. Builder Chris Newbold won the competition, taking home the £1,000 prize. Come Dine With Me has been running since 2005, and is currently into its 32nd series. Repeats are shown on Channel 4's channels almost every day. A spokesman for Kent Police confirmed officers visited Mr Marino last week, saying: 'Kent Police was called to an address (Marcello's home), to reports of harassment at 10.20am on September 1. 'Officers spoke to the informant to discuss the nature of the allegations and offered advice.' Come Dine With me contestant Anthony Wait . ANTHONY WAIT: As soon as Marino got in the door he told Mr Wait he was 'disappointed' at the size of his home. He then refused to eat his starter of stuffed garlic mushrooms with black pudding and herbs because 'it might have hairs in it'. He also told the balding artist 'your hair looks a bit greasy - a nice wig would suit you', and asked him: 'Are you a transvestite? You look like it'. LYDIA JONES: At Ms Jones' home the crimper told her she 'looked at state' and slagged her off 'for not doing her hair' before laying into her wardrobe saying she had 'no taste in clothes' and should 'buy some new ones'. He told her: 'I can't believe your taste in clothes - it's all different colours. I think she must have got it all very cheap in a charity shop.' He also told her: 'You have a beautiful face - it's a shame about your hair'. CHRIS NEWBOLD: Marino told Mr Newbold he looked like 'Bob the Builder' and joked that he had left his trouser zip undone when he arrived at his hairdressing salon for the meal. He also told him 'What happened to your hair then? You've got a terrible haircut'. DONNA GRIEVE: Ms Grieve the receptionist she 'looked a mess' and that she 'looked like she'd never had a bath'. he said her main course of cod with mozzarella and tomatoes looked 'like a sick bag'. He also said he was surprised she was doing three courses 'because she looks lazy' and, commenting on her shoes, said: 'I wouldn't touch them, they might smell.'","Marcello Marino, 44, insulted his fellow contestants' appearances .

"By . Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent, for The Daily Mail . It has emerged that Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf, who has been appointed to investigate claims of an Establishment cover-up of sexual abuse, as close ties to former Home Secretary Lord Brittan . MPs last night demanded answers from the new chairman of the historic child sex abuse inquiry about her links to Leon Brittan. On Friday, Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf was appointed to investigate claims of an Establishment cover-up of sexual abuse. But last night it emerged she has close ties to former Home Secretary Lord Brittan, who is likely to be called to give evidence about claims he oversaw the cover-up. The revelations sparked fury among MPs who campaigned for the inquiry, which has already seen one chairman, Baroness Butler-Sloss, step down. Labour MP Simon Danczuk said he was ‘dismayed’ by the revelations. He called on Mrs Woolf to ‘come out and explain her relationship with Leon Brittan’. He said he was ‘gobsmacked at how wrong the Home Office can get it’, adding: ‘For the chair of the inquiry to be a family friend of the Brittans is just not acceptable.’ Yesterday the Mail on Sunday revealed Mrs Woolf judges a City award scheme alongside Lord Brittan’s wife, Diana. She also gave her a £50 donation for a charity fun run last year. And it emerged she has lived on the same central London street as the Brittans for nearly a decade. A further link between the two emerged last night as it became apparent Mrs Woolf and Lord Brittan both sit on the advisory board of a lobbying group, TheCityUK, which was set up to campaign for the interests of the City of London. Mrs Woolf is likely to be called before the Home Affairs committee of MPs within weeks to be quizzed on her links to Lord and Lady Brittan. Last night there was silence from the Home Office about the allegations. Home Secretary Theresa May already suffered a damaging blow when her first choice for the inquiry, Lady Butler-Sloss, withdrew after it emerged her brother was Attorney General at the time some of the alleged abuse took place in the 1980s. The inquiry was announced in July after pressure from MPs and campaigners following claims about historic child sex abuse. It has been alleged Establishment figures covered up abuse in schools, hospitals, and churches dating back more than 30 years. The inquiry will examine what government, political parties and MI5 knew at the time. Fiona Woolf and Lord Brittan (left) both sit on the advisory board of a lobbying group, TheCityUK, which was set up to campaign for the interests of the City of London . Lord Brittan accepts he received the so-called Dickens dossier from MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983 but says he passed it to Home Office officials. He has also been questioned by police over allegations he raped a 19-year-old in 1967. Lord Brittan has never been arrested or charged and denies all allegations against him. Mrs Woolf could not be reached for comment last night.","Lord Mayor of London was chosen to probe Establishment abuse cover-up .

"By . Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . John Van Wisse, a swimming coach from Melbourne, completed his 20 year dream by being the 18th person to finish the brutal triathlon and smashing the world record . It is the 41-year-old 'iron' man, who puts our 15-kilometre run that we proudly complete without stopping to shame, as last week he became Australia's hero - running, swimming and riding 483-kilometres from London to Paris in the extreme Enduroman Arch to Arc ultra-distance Triathlon. John Van Wisse, a swimming coach from Melbourne, completed his 20 year dream by being the 18th person to finish the brutal triathlon. But he did more than just finish, Van Wisse ran 144 kilometres from London's Marble Arch to the Dover coast, swam the English Channel to the French coast, and hopped on a bike to complete the triathlon in a 291 kilometre cycle to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. His time was an extraordinary 61 hours, beating the previous record by more than 12 hours. While speaking with Daily Mail Australia, Van Wisse modestly jokes that his time could have been even better if it wasn't for the wrong turn he took while running through London and brutal water conditions in the English Channel. 'I actually thought I could go 10 hours quicker and if I had a half decent channel window and I didn't take that wrong turn at the beginning I would have - so seven or so hours added on to that and that's the rub of the green,' he said. He said leading up to the event he would try to get as much training done without breaking down -every Tuesday he swam 15 kilometres, on the weekend he would run up to 100 kilometres and on every other day he complete four to six hours of swimming and riding. But nothing would compare to what lay ahead. 'It was a real roller-coast. 'There was a time I contemplated pulling out; I was upset that I had got such a bad hand but then I thought I did all this training and stop feeling sorry for myself.' Van Wisse insists that his dream would not have been possible without the sponsorship he received from Acquire Learning. 16 hour, 144 km run from London to Dover . Eight hour rest . 12 hour, 50 km swim in the English Channel . Rest for 10 hours in Calais, France . 14 hour, 291 km cycle to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . Overall time: 61 hours 27 minutes . Group Managing Director of Acquire Learning, John Wall, swam regularly with Van Wisse and knew participating in the Enduroman event was a dream of his - so Mr Wall made it happen. Kim Vernon, Chief Marketing Officer said Acquire Learning is about helping people and making sure their dreams come true in life. 'We help everybody and anybody who need it - what we did in terms of sponsorship is connect to individuals and use them as an example,' Ms Vernon told Daily Mail Australia. 'Once I met him [Van Wisse] I was so inspired. He is amazing.' It was only last week when Ms Vernon was on Van Wisse's incredible adventure, as she and a crew supported him '110 per cent of the way', and even joining him for a few kilometres of running.

'I finished the run in 15-hours and 15-minutes - all of a sudden I felt really sick. I couldn't get breakfast down. 'I thought ""this is going to be tough"" especially because the English Channel conditions were really rough,' he said. Van Wisse chose to swim the English Channel on the Wednesday, which gave him only an eight hour break between running and swimming. He said there was only a small window of opportunity because if the weather was un-swimmable he would have had to wait a week. 'You need a bit of luck.' Despite his boatman warning him against swimming because of the rough water conditions, Van Wisse decided to keep going, as the clock never stops. Van Wisse had to give the boatman 24 hours notice before getting to the English Channel . Despite the warning of rough waters and difficult conditions, Van Wisse went full steam ahead into the English Channel for a 50-kilometre swim .

Ms Vernon describes her sympathy for the world-record holder, as she watched him swim against the rough waters. 'At the start of the swim his legs were jelly from the run - and then to think he had to swim through waves - there was not one stroke that I could just tune out. 'He pushed through the barrier and did not stop,' she said. 'It was quite emotional for a lot of people around him and everyone was so determined to support him.'

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . A New Zealand woman can cross streaking off her bucket list after getting her kit off at an All Blacks test match and dashing across the field to slap a player on the backside before getting tackled to the ground by security. Rose Kupa, 25, decided to disrobe and a make a run for it during a Mexican wave at the game on Saturday night where the Kiwi team smashed Argentina - 28-9 - in Napier on the southern part of the North Island. The unexpected cheeky entertainment included player Israel Dagg receiving a slap on the bum which he just laughed off but Kupa admitted she was actually aiming for his team mate Richie McCaw at the time.

Ms Kupa said the nudie run had been on her bucket list and admitted she got off 'quite lightly' after police decided not to charge her for the incident. 'I was expecting to take a harsher rap,' she told tvnz. Police opted not to charge the woman but council spokeswoman Robyn McLean said it was 'quite likely' a trespass notice would be served,  stuff.co.nz reported . Hawke's Bay area commander Inspector Tania Kura described the streak as merely a '30 second' blip in an otherwise well-behaved 22,000-strong crowd. 'I actually think that the consequence for the young lady is waking up today reflecting on everything,' Inspector Kura said. All Blacks coach Steve Hansen labelled the antic as 'a pain in the backside' and questioned security measures needed to be addressed to prevent punters getting on the field. 'They do really good tackles at the end of it, but they probably should do some before they get on - that would be handy.' Napier Mayor Bill Dalton was also not impressed with the naked disruption at McLean Park which had not hosted an All Blacks test since 1996. 'I just think it's absolutely, terribly disappointing that one girl can bring the entire security arrangements into question. It's just a shame she didn't have more brains,' he said.

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . China will overtake America to become the world's biggest economy in just 10 years, according to a report. The U.S. has been the world's economic leader for more than a century, but now, a huge rise in consumer spending in China is expected to see it passed in 2024. Chinese consumer spending is predicted to triple over the next decade, according to an IHS report - increasing from $3.5trillion to $10.5trillion. Scroll down for video . Chinese nominal GDP is predicted to reach $28.3trillion in 2024 thanks to increased consumer spending . This would boost their GDP to $28.3trillion, surpassing the USA's expected $27.4trillion - using today's prices. U.S. GDP is currently still significantly higher than China's - $17.4trillion compared with $10trillion. But with experts predicting China's consumer spending to grow at an average rate of 7.7 per cent per year, things look set to change. Using the same method of measuring as IHS, China was not expected to surpass America until 2028, a Centre for Economics and Business Research report said. Rajiv Biswas, IHS's chief Asia economist, said: 'China's economy is expected to re-balance towards more rapid growth in consumption, which will help the structure of the domestic economy as well as growth for the Asia Pacific (APAC) as a region. 'China's economy will play an even bigger role as a key driver of global trade and investment flows.' If IHS's predictions are correct, China will hold one-fifth of the world's GDP by 2025 - up from 12 per cent today. This surge in Chinese consumer spending will also help other South East Asian countries, as they will benefit from increased trade. While the IHS study says China will take 10 years to overtake the U.S. economy, another method of measuring suggests it may actually happen this year. The IHS report is based on nominal GDP, which does not accurately reflect the cost of living, whereas  the purchasing power parity method (PPP) measures the relative value of different currencies. Although it was not expected to overtake America until 2019 under PPP measurements, China may actually manage it in 2014, according to a World Bank backed report, which measured China's economy to be 87 per cent of the size of America's in 2011. Despite this all sounding like good news for the Chinese,  experts have warned that they need structural reform to make this level of growth more sustainable in the long run. The International monetary Fund (IMF) has advised China to target a safer growth rate of seven per cent in 2015, as without structural reform, growth could slow down dramatically, to as low as 2.5 per cent by 2030. Elsewhere in Asia, the IHS report also expects India's consumer market to grow quickly, and overtake Japan by 2023. By then, the Chinese consumer market is predicted to be three times larger than that of their Japanese neighbours.","IHS report says America will be knocked off its economic perch in 2014 .

"By . James Gordon . A woman from New York found a bracelet commemorating the life of an FDNY firefighter who was killed on September 11th 2001, washed up on a beach in Long Island. The bracelet was made to celebrate the life of Michael Otten, an FDNY firefighter who died on 9/11. His widow Marion Otten, of East Islip, gave it to her son Jonathan, but he ended up losing ot 10 years ago. Found! The bracelet honoring fallen 9/11 firefighter Michael Otten was found 10 years after it was lost . Recovered: It was found by Marlene Quinn, who was mourning the death her brother, a volunteer firefighter . Treasured possession: Marion Otten said her son, Jonathan Otten (seen here on the right)  now keeps the bracelet bearing his father's name on his bedroom dresser . It was when Marlene Quinn was out walking on Robert Moses Beach when she found the treasured possession. 'I was walking along and a wave came up. It went away and that bracelet was there,' she said. The bracelet bore Michael Otten's name, and she instantly recognized the name as a local firefighter. 'Michael J. Otten,' the inscription read. 'F.D.N.Y. LADDER 35 9/11/01.' In memorium: The bracelet was made in memory of Michael Otten, an FDNY firefighter who died on 9/11 . Marlene Quinn put the bracelet in the mail, along with a note . When the bracelet arrived, Otten's widow, Marion, didn't even know it was missing, she said . The item also had special significance for her because her own brother, Michael O'Neill, who was also a firefighter, had just died unexpectedly in the spring. 'I clutched it and held on to it for the longest time,' said Mrs Quinn said to NBC News. She tracked down the Otten family address and learned even more remarkable coincidences. Not only were the late Mr Otten and her brother both firefighters, they both lived in East Islip and at one time, lived just a block apart. Her brother also attended grade school directly across the street from Otten's family home, Mrs Quinn learned. She sent the bracelet back to the Ottens with a handwritten note. The two women met up on Friday, convinced the bracelet discovery was fate . 'Why now? Why did it wash up now?' Otten said to Quinn. 'You needed it. We needed it.' 'I knew they needed it and I thought it was my brother coming through,' Quinn said. 'There is another firefighter in heaven.' Marion Otten initially felt shocked, and then overwhelmed, she said, 'because people still remember, think about it.' When the bracelet arrived, Otten's widow, Marion, didn't even know it was missing, she said. Her son Jonathan had worn it in honor of his father. He lost it on the beach nearly a decade ago, when he was 11 or so. 'It was just a bracelet to me back then,' he said. 'It didn't have such a big meaning as it does now.' 'Things happen for a reason,' Marion Otten says. 'I see it as a sign.' 'There are no coincidences,' said Otten. 'There's a reason why it happened. It brings us together for whatever reason' ""We have a connection, I feel,"" said Marion Otten, who will visit her late husband's firehouse on the 9/11 anniversary on Thursday . Jonathan Otten now keeps the bracelet on his bedroom dresser. He's afraid to lose it again, she said. 'It's another tie to his dad and the department,' Marion Otten said. The two women have since met up to discuss their loving families and those that they lost. 'To think all the poor souls we did lose on 9/11, it's someone from my hometown,' said Quinn. 'Why now? Why did it wash up now?' Otten said to Quinn. 'You needed it. We needed it.' 'There are no coincidences,' said Otten. 'There's a reason why it happened. It brings us together for whatever reason.'","Bracelet honoring fallen 9/11 firefighter is found 10 years after it was lost .

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . 'I'm no bunny-hugger': BBC Springwatch presenter Chris Packham says hunters should be allowed to pay to shoot deer and mink . Deer and mink should be shot and killed by fee-paying hunters, TV naturalist Chris Packham has said. The BBC Springwatch presenter, who describes himself as a 'pragmatic conservationist', says hunters should be allowed to shoot the animals in areas of overpopulation. He says that hunters and animal-lovers should put their differences aside to tackle the problem, Independent on Sunday reported . Mr Packham said: 'I can't understand why anyone would want to kill animals for fun, and anybody who dies, I think, is psychopathic.' 'But I'm not a bunny-hugger. Some areas would benefit from a reduction in deer or American mink because they have no natural predators and cause notable damage. 'I could see a creative partnership between the conservationists and the shooting fraternity.' The American mink is considered to be bad for the environment because it kills water voles. Deer, of which four of the six species in the UK are non-native, destroy the habitats of woodland birds and dormice. Mr Packham called for a survey by environmentalists to find out the population sizes of deer and mink in different parts of the UK. He believes this data should then be used to work out how many animals should be killed. Animal welfare groups blasted the Springwatch presenter's controversial plan. Scroll down for video . Oh deer: Mr Packham says some overpopulated areas would benefit from a reduction in deer numbers . Conservationists called Mr Packham's plan to allow hunters to kill American mink 'massively disappointing' Jay Tiernan, spokesman for Stop the Cull, said: 'It's massively disappointing to have someone like Chris come up with an idea like that. 'It's a slippery slope. If you get into bed with people like that, they will make the most of it.' The League Against Cruel Sports said three tests should be applied when considering controlling animal populations - the scientific evidence behind a cull, whether it is humane, and whether it is sustainable. Chief executive Joe Duckworth said: 'The notion that culling could be carried out by hunters to satisfy their desire to kill these animals for sport, fails all three of these tests.' However, the Countryside Alliance back Mr Packham's plan. A spokesman said: 'We are always keen to work with anyone genuinely interested in conservation.' Mink escaped from fur farms in the 1950s and 1960s and now breed across most of the country. They are active predators, feeding on anything they are big enough to catch, including native water voles, which are now under threat of extinction. They hunt on the riverbanks and are good swimmers, enabling them to enter the water-line burrows of water voles. Mink, which have a similar appearance to otters, but can be distinguished  by their smaller size, darker fur, and small white chin and throat.

More than 100 mostly female students at a public high school on Staten Island were told they violated its dress code and -- in the words of one local media outlet -- were 'slut-shamed into covering up'. Students at Tottenville High School who showed up for class on Friday without the proper attire were forced to to either cover up or wait in the sweltering auditorium on one of the hottest days of the year for their parents to arrive with the appropriate garb, according to the Staten Island Advance. Upset students took to Twitter and Facebook to vent their anger, and one parent whose three daughters were detained for wearing shorts said he was considering filing a class action lawsuit. More than 100 students at Tottenville High School on Staten Island were told on Friday they violated its dress code and were required to cover up before they could attend class . The school's dress code prohibits tank tops, low-cut blouses, tubes/halter and midriff tops, short-shorts, mini-skirts, hooded sweatshirts, sweatpants, leggings, 'skinny jeans,' headbands, hats, bandanas, sunglasses and visible undergarments, according to the Staten Island Advance. Some students, such as sophomore Olivia Buonomo, were given grey Tottenville athletic T-shirts to wear. She said 'it's not fair' that she was forced to wear the 'heavy' substitute for her much lighter tank top on such a hot day, the Advance reported. Classmate Tiffani Cropley avoided being caught by carrying her bookbag in front of her as she walked to classes. Freshman Gianna Savattiere said she wouldn't mind the dress code if the school was air-conditioned. 'The whole building is sweltering today,' she said. Vincent Candellieri said he had to pick up his three daughters after they were detained for wearing shorts. 'I can understand where they're coming from, but this is outrageous,' he said, adding he is considering filing a lawsuit. Interim principal Joseph Scarmato said he's simply attempting to enforce the school's existing rules and discipline code, which he argued is necessary to prepare the students for college and the workplace.","Students at the Staten Island school who showed up on Friday wearing clothes that violated the dress code were forced to cover up with 'heavy' grey T-shirts or wait in a sweltering auditorium for their parents to bring them proper attire .

The 56-year-old said he has been able to put his children through university and private school thanks to the hits which include 'The Riddle', 'Wouldn't it be Good' and 'I Won't Let the Sun go Down on Me'.

Singer Nik Kershaw, pictured, has revealed how he made millions of pounds from just four songs he wrote in the 1980s and 90s . But the musician revealed his worst business investment was buying a mansion in Ireland with five partners. He told the Sunday Telegraph how he bought the 'massive' house, which once belonged to Noel Redding, the bassist for Jimi Hendrix, in 2005. They sold the property at the start of this year for a third of the purchase price - and he lost £150,000, he revealed. He said in the interview that receiving royalties for his songs, including 'The One and Only', was 'like having a pension'. The 56-year-old said he has been able to put his children through university and private school thanks to four songs he wrote . He said: 'That song has made me millions of pounds over the years, along with The Riddle, Wouldn't it be Good and I Won't Let the Sun go Down on Me. 'It's put my kids through university and private school.' The One and Only spent five weeks at number one in the singles chart in March and April 1991. In the early 1980s, his hit 'I Won't Let The Sun Go Down On Me' soared to number two having been re-released and became a major hit in a number of other countries. The same album, 'Human Racing', yielded 'Wouldn't it be Good' and spent three weeks at number four in the charts. Nik Kershaw received 'huge' royalties from the 1991 chart topper 'The One and Only', which was performed by Chesney Hawkes, pictured . The Riddle, a song from his album of the same name, reached number three in 1984. Kershaw, whose tour 'Me Myself and I' runs until October 12, said he once bought a Porsche Boxster but that he 'felt such a prat getting in and out of it that I sold it soon after' and replaced it with a Volvo. When asked whether money made him happy, he replied, 'no', but added it can help take stress away and provide for your family. Talking about his favourite charities, he said he backs the Down's Syndrome Association as his son has the condition while he also supports the cancer charity Macmillian. The singer added a recent surge in interest in the Eighties has helped things along. 'At the end of the Nineties when royalties were drying up and my new stuff wasn't getting recorded or covered by other artists, it was looking dodgy. 'But over the last 15 years it’s got better and better, maybe because of the Eighties revival.’","Nik Kershaw says he made millions of pounds from four songs he wrote .

"By . James Chapman for the Daily Mail . The validity of next year’s General Election is being called into question if the Scots vote for independence. Currently, voters north of the border are expected to be able to take part next May, meaning Labour could win a majority thanks to its dominance of Scottish constituencies. In May 2010 Labour won 41 seats in Scotland, the Lib Dems 11, the SNP six while the Conservatives secured just one MP. Scroll down for video . The validity of the 2015 General Election is being called into question because a Labour win means, led by Ed Miliband (pictured) they'd be in charge of a 'zombie government' in power thanks to Scottish MPs . But all Scottish MPs would be swept away in March 2016, when Scotland would become an independent nation. One minister said: ‘Labour could win a majority in 2015 but it would be running a zombie government which everyone knows would lose that majority less than a year later. What would happen then? Nobody seems to be thinking about these questions.’ Some MPs now suggest they will call for legislation to be introduced to postpone the election in the event of a yes vote. Former Labour MP Eric Joyce, now an independent, said the election would ‘surely be cancelled’ It would be the first time since 1940, a year into the second world war, that a general election would have been postponed. Former Labour MP Eric Joyce, now an independent, said the election would ‘surely be cancelled’, adding: ‘An English parliamentary election would be an entirely new proposition for voters south of the new border. ‘There could meanwhile be no question that, for example, Labour might win a UK election by a small majority, only to see a Tory government and prime minister take power in England without an election once the Scots had departed. 'Moreover, the notion of Scottish MPs voting on England-only matters while the whole parliament was consumed by Scots extracting themselves from the union would be nonsensical and unmanageable.’ Angus Robertson, SNP leader at Westminster, called last year for a delay in the election to allow the negotiations on separation to take place. But the House of Lords constitution select committee raised doubts about a delay, saying: ‘The extension of a parliament beyond five years ... may risk being seen by voters as self-serving, extending the time in power of the current government.’","The validity of next year's General Election is being called into question if Scotland votes for independence .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . At any one time there are more than 110,000 stray or abandoned dogs in the UK, with 21 dogs a day being put down by local authorities, research has shown. And nearly three quarters of owners (72%) are unaware that they only have a week to reclaim a dog from a local authority before it can be put down. But it's not all bad news as the overall numbers of stray and abandoned dogs handled by councils has actually fallen one per cent this year from 111,986 to 110,675, and 10,084 dogs were reunited with their owners thanks to electronic chips. Scroll down for video . There are more than 110,000 stray or abandoned dogs in the UK, with 21 dogs a day being put down by local authorities, research has shown . The annual Stray Dog Survey by the Dog's Trust also revealed that nearly a third of owners (29%) will lose their dog at least once during its lifetime . The slight improvement in the survey that covers 1st April 2013 and 31st March 2014 could be down to technologies such as microchipping which continue to grow in popularity. When dogs do go missing, close to two thirds (64 per cent) of owners don't know whose responsibility it is to care for missing strays with nearly half (46 per cent) saying they would get in touch with a family member or neighbour, rather than call the local council. Once the dog is in local authority care it is only seven days before their pet can be transferred to a new owner or they are put to sleep if a new home cannot be found. A huge 7,085 dogs were destroyed by councils over the year. The Dog's Trust found that 7,085 dogs were destroyed by councils in 2013 . Of the 1,000 people surveyed 96 per cent thought there were only about 20,000 strays or abandoned dogs, a huge underestimation. Widely considering their dog as one of the family, one fifth (20 per cent) of owners said they had taken time off work because of a missing dog with, on average, taking 4.2 days when their dog went missing. Sixty one per cent of those dog owners said they'd be too embarrassed to talk about their absence openly with colleagues, choosing instead to explain their time off as 'annual leave' (63 per cent), or 'compassionate leave' (33 per cent). The annual Stray Dog Survey by the Dog's Trust also revealed that nearly a third of owners (29%) will lose their dog at least once during its lifetime . Despite being dog owners, half of those surveyed said they never take any action to note down the contact information or details of the missing dog after having seen a 'missing dog' poster. Clarissa Baldwin OBE, Chief Executive of Dogs Trust said: 'The number of instances of straying on our streets is declining, but we still have a significant job to do when it comes to raising awareness about responsible dog ownership. 'Owners are unsure of who to reach out to and how much time they have to recover their dog should he or she go missing. 'Microchipping not only helps speed up the process of reuniting an owner with their dog, it is also significantly reducing the number of strays overall. 'We're calling on dog owners across the UK to come along to one of our free microchipping events at www.chipmydog.org.uk so that we can continue to improve the situation ahead of the change in law in Wales in 2015 and England in 2016 which will make microchipping compulsory.'","Annual survey by the Dog's Trust reveals heartbreaking statistics in 2013 .

'A lifelong committed Catholic, Jim always took a lead in fostering links between the Church and the Labour Party, and his strong faith informed every aspect of his political and public life. This was recognised by Pope Benedict XVI when he made Jim a Papal knight. 'I will miss Jim’s good friendship and decency. On behalf of the Labour Party, I offer our sincere condolences to his wife, Pat and, their children. We will all miss him.' The MP was made a papal knight by Pope Benedict in 2008. In parliament, he co-chaired a group pushing for more vaccines children in the developing world. He voted against the same-sex marriage bill last year and spoke out against the plans in Parliament, saying: ‘I think MPs who voted for this change will rue the day they did so.’ Mr Dobbin was the local MP for Fusilier Lee Rigby, the soldier who was murdered in Woolwich, south-east London, last year. He said at the time that the death had ‘absolutely traumatised’ people in Fusilier Rigby's home town of Middleton, Greater Manchester. Mr Dobbin, the son of a coal miner, was born in Kincardine, in Fife. He went to Napier College, Edinburgh, where he studied bacteriology and virology, before working as a microbiologist for 33 years, 22 of which were for the Royal Oldham Hospital. Lord Prescott said: ‘Jim was an excellent local MP, a strong believer in Europe, a proud Scot and a passionate defender of the NHS. ‘His passing is such a tragic loss and he will be sadly missed by the Labour movement. Jim was a great comrade.’ Commons Speaker John Bercow said: ‘He was a deeply principled and independent-minded parliamentarian; respected and well-liked by his colleagues, he will be greatly missed.’ Ivan Lewis, Labour MP for Bury South, tweeted: ‘Jim Dobbin was a man of great integrity and decency. Sometimes didn't agree but always respected his sincerity.’ Former Labour deputy prime minister John Prescott and the party's leader Ed Miliband today paid tribute to Mr Dobbin . Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell tweeted: ‘Really sorry to hear of the sudden death of Jim Dobbin MP. I only saw him on Friday voting against bedroom tax. He was a great MP.’ Simon Danczuk wrote: ‘Shockled and Saddened to hear Jim Dobbin MP has died. My condolences go out to his wife Pat & their children. He will be sorely missed.’ Fellow Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds wrote: ‘Absolutely stunned by the news about Jim. I spoke to him just before he left for Poland. An incredibly committed MP and a good man.’ Philip Davies added: ‘So so sorry to learn of the death of Labour MP Jim Dobbin. One of the nicest, most honourable and decent MPs - he will be greatly missed.’ Former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy said: ‘Very sad to hear of my friend and Council of Europe colleague Jim Dobbins sudden death.

"By . Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . A 514-year-old book which contains 67 paintings created by some of the most talented Renaissance artists has been purchased for more than $15 million by Channel Seven chairman Kerry Stokes. The Rothschild Prayerbook, also known as a Book of Hours, was once owned by a European banking family, the Rothschilds, and was taken from them by Adolf Hitler in 1938 when Austria was invaded by the Nazis. Each page of the prayerbook - which was created in the 16th century and used for private worship - is made of animal skin and lined with gold leafing. It is not known who commissioned it to be made or how four pages of it went missing. Channel Seven chairman Kerry Stokes purchased the 514-year-old book for $15.5 million . The Rothschild Prayerbook contains 67 paintings done by some of the most talented Renaissance artists . When Hilter took the prayerbook from the Rothschilds, he stored it in the Nazi vaults with other pieces of priceless art works until it was moved to the Vienna Library, presumably because he thought it would be safer there. After the fall of the Nazis, the library refused to return the prayerbook to the Rothschilds. The family waged a 60-year battle with the Austrian government to get it back. In 1999, it was finally returned to its rightful owners, according to Channel Seven's Sunday Night. The book then went under the hammer at a Christie's auction months later in England and was purchased by an anonymous buyer. The prayerbook was not to be seen for another 15 years. The prayerbook was created in the 16th century and used for private worship . It is not known how four pages of the book went missing but it was once owned by Adolf Hitler . But then in 2014, it re-appeared at another Christie's auction at New York City's Rockefeller Centre. As a phone bidder, Mr Stokes - an art enthusiast - bought the slice of history for $15.5 million to add to his collection in Perth in Western Australia. But he will not keep it to himself like the prayerbook's previous owners, it will soon go on a tour of the east coast to Canberra and Melbourne. Mr Stokes said the book felt alive underneath his fingertips when he first touched it. Its pages are made of animal skin and lined with gold leafing, and has pictures of Madonna holding Jesus Christ . The prayerbook is now part of Mr Stokes' private art collection in Perth in Western Australia . 'When I first saw it I actually didn’t know if I should touch it and open it, I started to turn the pages and the hair on the back of my arm stood up,' he told Sunday Night. 'I’m a pretty tough nut I guess and I love art as one of the expressions that...probably appeals to the softer side a lot of people would deny I have. 'This is so unique I expect a lot of people will want to come and see it - we will have something else to offer that nobody else has and that’s the Rothschild Prayerbook.'","The Rothschild Prayerbook was created in the 16th century and used for private worship .

"By . Daniel Piotrowski for Daily Mail Australia . and Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . Pictures have emerged of those injured in a horror tour bus crash in Kenya which claimed the lives of two Australians and injured at least 14. The Intrepid Travel tour bus, which was ferrying 25 people, overturned and plunged into a river on a notorious stretch of road west of Nairobi, the country's capital, on Sunday. Local police identified the dead as a man and a woman in their 60s. One victim died on the spot, Kenyan media said. The crash happened just outside the city of Nairobi in the East African country of Kenya . Narok County Governor Samuel ole Tunai (arms outstretched) visited the injured tourists in hospital. An unidentified injured woman speaks to a nurse and the county governor, Samuel ole Tunai, in an image released by the local government. The government said the spouses of the dead Australians were among those admitted to hospital. They suffered injuries and 'deep shock', a statement said. The county government released images of local officials visiting the wounded at Narok County Referral Hospital on its Facebook page overnight. Eighteen of the injured and all Intrepid Tours staff have now been flown to Nairobi for treatment. In a statement released to Daily Mail Australia, James Thornton, the managing director of the Melbourne-based Intrepid Tours said: . 'Our first concern is with those affected and their friends and families. 'Senior managers from our operations team in Kenya are assisting passengers and staff involved.' County police commander Paul Kerich told local newspaper The Standard that the bus, which was carrying three staff and 22 tourists, was en route to Tanzania. He described the crash zone was a renowned black spot. 'There are a lot of sharp bends and steep depressions a long this road. 'We want to appeal to drivers especially those who are new to exercise caution so as to avoid unnecessary deaths.' The tourists on board were from the United Kingdom, the U.S., Germany, Switzerland and Australia. Kenyan roads have a poor reputation. Just last August, 41 people were killed in a bus crash in Narok. Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters the crash was tragic. 'It's awful beyond belief for the families of those involved,' he said on Monday morning. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular support to the families of those affected.","Two Australians confirmed dead as Kenyan tour bus overturns and plunges into a creek .

"By . Ap  Reporter . Serena Williams ended a difficult-for-her Grand Slam season in the best way possible, winning her third consecutive U.S. Open title by beating Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 6-3 on Sunday. Williams equaled Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova with 18 major singles titles, the fourth-most in history. Williams also matched Evert's total of six championships at the U.S. Open and became the first woman to win three in a row since Evert's four-title run from 1975-78. Williams earned $4 million, a record in tennis — $3 million for the title, plus a $1 million bonus for having had the best results during the North American summer hard-court circuit. It was a dominant performance to cap a dominant two weeks in Flushing Meadows. Not only did Williams, ranked and seeded No. 1, win all 14 sets she played in the tournament, she never even dropped more than three games in any of them.

Overjoyed: Serena Williams jumps with her trophy after her victory over Caroline Wozniacki  of Denmark  during their 2014 US Open Women's Singles finals . Serena Williams of the US poses with the championship trophy after defeating good friend Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark to win the women's final match on the fourteenth day of the 2014 US Open Tennis Championship at the USTA National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, New York . Until the U.S. Open, though, Williams had not been at her best on her sport's biggest stages in 2014. She lost in the fourth round at the Australian Open, the second round at the French Open, and the third round at Wimbledon, where a disoriented Williams also struggled through an odd appearance in doubles that was attributed to a viral illness. Back at the top of her game, Williams broke Wozniacki's serve five times and compiled a hard-to-believe 29-4 edge in winners. Remarkably, until a cross-court backhand on the run in the final game that even Williams applauded, the only winners registered by the 10th-seeded Wozniacki came on a trio of aces, one in the first set, two in the second. That was, in part, a result of the Dane's iffy play in only her second Grand Slam final — she lost to Kim Clijsters at the 2009 U.S. Open — but more due to Williams' relentless pursuit of every ball. A few weeks shy of her 33rd birthday, making the American the oldest major champion since Navratilova was 33 at Wimbledon in 1990, Williams simply would not allow a shot to get past her. Wozniacki is the one training for the New York City Marathon, but Williams tired her out by the end. Wozniacki was not exactly an extra in this Williams highlight reel, but pretty close to it. The points were being directed by Williams, whether via serves that reached 120 mph (194 kph), forceful returns that backed Wozniacki into a corner when not producing outright winners, unreachable groundstrokes from all angles or even the occasional volley.

Yes, this, as might have been expected, was really all about Williams. At times, it felt as if Wozniacki were there because, well, someone needed to be on the opposite side of the net to act as Williams' opponent. They've been good pals for years, and they hung out together in Miami — heading to the beach, watching an NBA playoff game — right after both lost early at the French Open in May. Wozniacki says Williams helped her get over the end of her engagement to golf star Rory McIlroy. That friendship between Williams and Wozniacki did not matter one bit, of course, while they played Sunday with so much at stake as early evening shadows moved across the court in Arthur Ashe Stadium. As Williams put it beforehand, referring to her older sister, ""If I can play Venus, I can play anybody."" Sure looked that way Sunday.

"By . Reuters . A Space Exploration Technologies Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Sunday to put a commercial communications satellite into orbit. The 224-foot (68-meter) tall rocket lifted off from its seaside launch pad at 1 a.m. EDT/0500 GMT, dashing through partly cloudy, nighttime skies as it headed toward space. Tucked inside the rocket’s nosecone was the second of two satellites owned by Hong Kong-based Asia Satellite Telecommunications Holdings Ltd, or AsiaSat. Blastoff! Knifing through thin clouds, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the AsiaSat 6 communications satellite climbs away from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station early Sunday . Up, up and away! SpaceX launched AsiaSat 6 in an early morning launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Florida. Using the Falcon 9 rocket and after short weather delay the mission got underway . The first satellite, AsiaSat 8, was successfully delivered into an orbit some 22,200 miles (35,700 km) above Earth on Aug. 5. Both satellites were built by Space Systems/Loral, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based subsidiary of Canada’s MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. “With the two satellites coming out of the factory approximately the same time we were able to book back-to-back missions,” said AsiaSat chief executive William Wade. The two launches cost AsiaSat about $110 million, Wade said. Privately owned SpaceX, as the company is known, planned to launch the second satellite, AsiaSat 6, two weeks ago, but delayed the flight to recheck the rocket’s systems following an unrelated accident that claimed the company’s prototype Falcon 9R reusable lander during a test flight on Aug. 22. We have lift-off! A Space X  Falcon 9 rocket carrying the AsiaSat 6 mission for the United State Air Force turn's night into day . “We are confident there is no direct link,” SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk wrote in a statement after the calling off the launch. The Falcon 9R, a modified three-engine Falcon rocket, self-destructed shortly after liftoff from SpaceX’s McGregor, Texas, facility. Musk said the problem was due to a blocked sensor port, a situation that would not have impacted an operational Falcon rocket. “What we do want to triple-check is whether even highly improbable…scenarios have the optimal fault detection and recovery logic,” Musk wrote. SpaceX on Saturday declined to say if any equipment or procedures were changes as a result of the investigation. Sunday’s launch was the 12th flight of a Falcon 9 rocket, which in addition to delivering satellites for commercial companies flies Dragon cargo ships to the International Space Station for NASA. Telecommunications company AsiaSat now has a new satellite in orbit, it’s second in less than two months . SpaceX is competing to build a passenger version of Dragon to fly astronauts as well and is attempting to break into the lucrative military satellite launch business. The satellite launched on Sunday is outfitted with 28 high-power C-band transponders for video distribution and broadband network services in China and Southeast Asia. Half of the transponders are reserved for Thaicom PLC, which owns the orbital slot AsiaSat 6 will use, Wade said. The new satellite, which is designed to last 15 years, is the sixth member of AsiaSat’s current orbital network, half of which were launched by Russian Proton rockets.","Telecommunications company AsiaSat now has a new satellite in orbit, it’s second in less than two months .

"By . Deni Kirkova for MailOnline . A university science lecturer has stripped off her lab coat to be crowned a national champion of pole dancing. Forensic scientist Amy Cowles, 30, from Abbey Hulton, Staffs. took up the hobby five years ago and says pole dancing has changed her life. The previously shy and reserved self-confessed 'science-geek' said the activity gave her the confidence to come out of her shell. Scroll down for video . Champion pole dancer Amy Cowles stripped off her lab coat to be crowned at Miss Pole Dance UK . Now the flexible teacher feels quite comfortable gyrating around a pole in front of hundreds of people at competitions across the UK. Last month the lecturer at Keele University scooped first place to win at Miss Pole Dance UK in Capel, Surrey. She took the Semi Pro instructor category and has now set her sights on the professional title at the British championships next month. Amy said: 'I get an amazing buzz from pole dancing. 'I have seen big changes in my life since I started. I am much more confident around people. 'I have never been in as good a shape as I am now. I'm so much more toned than I used to be and feel far healthier. By day stunning Amy is a teaching fellow for Forensic Science BSc students . She says the sport gave her the confidence to come out of her shell . 'And then mentally it is really positive too. Socially I have seen a difference. 'I am far more outgoing now than I used to be, both because of the physical aspects of it but also from all the friends I have made there. It's like a second home. 'I was definitely more shy before I started this. I was kind of seen as a bit of a geek because I was doing science, and while I did try to have a social life, I had to work really hard too. 'I became a lab assistant at Keele University after that, and then did a teaching qualification so I am a teaching fellow there now. 'It's a complete polar opposite to the pole dancing, but it's nice to have two completely different jobs because I get different things out of both of them. 'People used to see me as geeky, not that it bothered me, but the pole dancing let's people see me in a different light.' Amy first joined the British Pole Dance Academy, at a studio in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., in 2009. She has now started teaching her favourite past-time at the academy as well. Amy added: 'I tried all sorts of sports but the difference with pole-dancing was I'd found something that interests me, that's got so many different elements to it. Amy likes having two completely different jobs because she get different things out of both of them . 'I was a bit nervous because I'd never done anything like it before. 'I wasn't particularly fit or strong and I was worried I wouldn't be able to do anything and everyone else would be great.' Amy's potential was soon spotted by academy owner Deb Riley, herself a former British champion. She started entering competitions soon after, culminating in her winning the Semi Pro Instructor category at Miss Pole Dance UK, picking up the 'best tricks' category along the way. Amy won the judges over after performing a five minute routine with a gold-digger theme based on Madonna's Material Girl. Amy, who lives with her long-term boyfriend, Chris Cooper, 33, said: 'I try to make the costumes myself, I really enjoy it. I buy what I need and then I bling it up. 'I was always quite a girly girl anyway. I love all the outfits, doing my hair and make-up, the eyelashes, the nails, sticking on glitter. 'It's a great excuse to get yourself really done up. 'There were a few people used to say 'oh, I didn't know you did that', but mainly it was 'good for you, doing something you like'. 'It's so normal now I don't even think about it. I'm proud I pole dance and proud to say I pole dance.' Amy will attempt to win the overall professional Miss Pole Dance UK title in Sussex on On October 4. She added: 'I don't have a grand masterplan, I just do it because I enjoy it. Just being up on stage is a massive achievement for me. 'Whatever else happens is a bonus.' She now hopes to win the overall professional Miss Pole Dance UK title in Sussex on On October 4 .","Amy Cowles, 30, from Abbey Hulton, Staffs took up the hobby five years ago .

"By . Louise Eccles for Daily Mail . Millions of employees in a workplace pension scheme are to be freed from punitive curbs on savings imposed by Brussels. Earners were limited to £4,600 a year in contributions as part of the government-backed National Employment Savings Trust (NEST). They were also barred from transferring old company pensions into the scheme or taking it with them if they moved jobs. Pensions Minister Steve Webb (pictured) said: 'By convincing Europe to support us on this, we’ve achieved a victory for consumers' But after a year of negotiation, the European Commission has agreed to lift the restrictions in a ‘victory’ for employees, ministers will announce today. Pensions Minister Steve Webb said: ‘This is a common sense decision which will help people to save and give certainty and confidence to employers choosing to use NEST. ‘By convincing Europe to support us on this, we’ve achieved a victory for consumers.’ However, savers will have to wait until April 1, 2017 for the changes to kick in. The low-cost, not-for-profit pension was designed for small businesses and low to moderate earners who could not afford to pay into more expensive company pensions. More than 1.5million workers have joined since 2012 – and the figure is expected to reach four million in the next three years. The European Commission imposed restrictions because of fears that a state-funded pension scheme could distort or threaten competition from private pension firms. Frances O’Grady, general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ‘great news for savers’ Mr Webb said it had put many businesses off because it would have meant running two parallel pensions – one for higher earners and NEST for low-income staff. Relaxing the rules meant workers could avoid having ‘pensions scattered all over the place’, which risked people losing track of their savings, he said. The move comes after pressure from union and employer groups, the National Association of Pension Funds, NEST and criticism from MPs on the Work and Pensions Select Committee. Frances O’Grady, general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ‘great news for savers’. ‘It was always ridiculous that people could not save as much as they wanted into NEST,’ she added. Mr Webb defended the 2017 deadline, saying Parliament was ‘littered’ with legislation that had been rushed through and blamed the delay on lengthy consultations with the pension industry and Eurocrats. NEST was introduced alongside automatic enrolment, which forces every boss to pay into a pension for workers who are over 22 and earn at least £10,000 by 2018.","Millions of employees in a workplace pension scheme are to be freed from curbs on savings imposed by the EU .

"By . Richard Shears for MailOnline . Two young Japanese girls left their shoes side by side high up on an apartment building then jumped to their deaths in a joint suicide that has shocked the country. The elementary schoolgirls, aged 11 and 12, made the fatal leap from between the seventh and eight floors of the building in Tokyo’s Ota Ward, leaving residents around the nation asking: Why? Police said the youngsters had left a suicide note with their neatly-laid- out shoes, but declined to reveal its contents. 'The note is a matter for the parents - it is personal,’ said a police spokesman. Police said the 11-year-old lived with her family in the apartment building, while her 12-year-old classmate lived nearby. Scroll down for video . Two schoolgirls jumped to their death from this apartment building in Tokyo, Japan . Baffled school officials told the Japan Times newspaper that the girls had attended school on Friday and had apparently got on well with their classmates. 'There had been no incidents of bullying or anything like that,’ said a school official. 'They were in the same class and appeared to get on well with everyone.’ Their classmates said the girls were both bright and considered as leaders among their friends. ‘They did not show any signs of being worried about anything,’ said a school friend. After removing their shoes the girls jumped, one dying instantly when they hit the asphalt parking lot near the entrance to the building. The other child died shortly afterwards. Shocked Japanese families have taken to newspaper comment sites and social media to ask how two young girls with everything to live for should have made such a fatal decision to die together. Friends of the girls said they noticed nothing unusual about the pair at school and they had not been bullied . ‘How do you possibly comment on this?’ asked one writer. ‘Just lost for words.’ Another asked: ‘What can be so wrong in a 11-12 year old's life to end it like this?’ ‘What was wrong with the lives of two young girls to make them want to kill themselves,’ questioned another writer. ‘I hate to think what they must have suffered to the point they thought jumping off a building was the best thing to do,’ remarked one writer. ‘They were failed by the adults around them.’ A report by the World Health Organisation ranks the suicide rate in Japan as fourth among high-income countries. The report found that in 2012, when the latest statistics were compiled, Japan had 29,442 suicides that year behind South Korea, Lithuania and Russia. Many of the deaths, WHO reported, were among people aged 70 and over.","An 11 and a 12-year-old apparently jumped off an apartment building .

That followed the killing of three Israeli youths in the occupied West Bank by Hamas Islamist militants. The seething tensions have underscored deepening divisions in the Israeli-occupied part of the city that Israel claims as its 'indivisible capital'.

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Sunderland's sporting director Lee Congerton is hoping to avoid wholesale change once again this summer. The Black Cats made 14 signings during the last closed-season as then director of football Roberto De Fanti and manager Paolo Di Canio opted for revolution rather than evolution. It was a policy which ultimately proved ill-founded as the club fought a season-long battle for Barclays Premier League survival which eventually cost both men their jobs. VIDEO Scroll down for Poyet: Sunderland's Great Escape is my proudest achievement . Upheaval: Jack Colback and Fabio Borini are two players to have left the club this summer . Lap of honour: Gus Poyet kept the club up following an incredible escape from relegation . Deserved break: Manager Gus Poyet, pictured with Fabio Cannavaro, is currently with ITV at the World Cup . Twelve months on, replacements Congerton and Gus Poyet are attempting to rebuild a squad decimated by the departure of out-of-contract players and loan signings without the same kind of upheaval, and that is proving challenging. Asked if he envisaged a similar influx, Congerton told BBC Sport: 'I want to say no, but when we look at the team ourselves... 'I'm sure any fan can say we need a left-back, we probably need a centre-half, we probably need some midfield players, we probably need to replace Fabio (Borini), maybe a centre-forward, so all of a sudden, the numbers are going up into double figures again, and that's the last thing I want, and Gus as well. 'But we need to improve the quality. The starting 11 is very important, we need to have a squad. 'But first of all, we need to have a starting 11 that can be competitive week in, week out in the Premier League, so we do need more players. 'But for me, it's not so much about the quantity, it's also about the quality. I don't want to sign players just for the sake of it.' Moving on: Craig Gardner has moved to West Brom and Colback has moved to rivals Newcastle . Gone: Phil Bardsley is another one to have moved on . Sunderland's problems last season were compounded by the fact that 13 of their 14 new arrivals were overseas players, many of whom had never before played in the Premier League. Some managed to adapt, but several did not, and that is an error the club hopes to avoid this time around. Congerton said: 'Currently, we are trying to get players who are already established in the Premier League. 'That's difficult because they have a premium, they cost more money and maybe they are already happy where they are. 'Then we have to open ourselves up and go a little bit further afield, and maybe we are not set up for that at the moment. Maybe that was one of the difficult points last season, so many players coming from different countries. 'Maybe we take one step back and try to concentrate on what we know a little bit better than what we don't know.'

"By . Daniel Martin for the Daily Mail . Thousands of commuters will see rail fares double today. Changes imposed by the Government on the main rail company in the north of England mean some people will be paying 162 per cent more than they did on Friday. Commuters in Chancellor George Osborne’s constituency of Tatton in Cheshire will be among the hardest hit, along with travellers in Nick Clegg’s Sheffield Hallam seat. Scroll down for video . The Chancellor George Osborne (above) said fare increases would be capped at 2.5 per cent but this will be of little comfort to Northern Rail customers facing ‘stealth’ rises . Mr Osborne chose yesterday to announce that countrywide fare rises planned in January will be limited to 2.5 per cent – not 3.5 per cent as previously thought. But the cap will be of little comfort to Northern Rail customers facing ‘stealth’ rises from today. The increases come as the Government forces Northern Rail to introduce evening peak ticket restrictions on local services. This is to plug the gap caused by the cost to the taxpayer of the West Coast franchise saga in 2012. From today, off-peak tickets will no longer be valid on some trains between 4.01pm and 6.29pm on weekdays, which means sharp increases in some fares. A day return from Styal in Tatton, Mr Osborne’s constituency, to Manchester is £7.90 instead of £5.20, an increase of 52 per cent. And a day return from Dore and Totley in Sheffield Hallam, Nick Clegg’s seat, to Sheffield will be £3.30, up 43 per cent from £2.30. From today, off-peak tickets will no longer be valid on some trains between 4.01pm and 6.29pm on weekdays, which means sharp increases in some fares . Someone travelling from Rochdale to Wigan will pay £11 for a day return, an increase of 162 per cent. A spokesman for the Department of Transport said: ‘These changes will help us achieve our long-term plan of building a rail network that is better for the passenger and better value for the taxpayer. ‘Such restrictions are relatively common on other parts of the network, including in the Merseytravel area, and we expect only a minority of passengers to be affected.’ Labour’s transport spokesman Mary Creagh said: ‘This is a direct result of the Government’s West Coast franchise fiasco and commuters travelling to Leeds, Manchester, Bradford, Sheffield and Newcastle are paying the price. Many Northern Rail passengers will see their fares jump 162 per cent this weekend . ‘People shouldn’t have to choose between paying more or waiting until after dark to travel.’ She called for a strict cap on fare rises and reform of the railways. The botched franchising of the West Coast line cost taxpayers more than £50million and meant the Government had to negotiate extensions to existing franchises, including Northern Rail. Yesterday, Mr Osborne announced the annual New Year fare rise will be 2.5 per cent, not 3.5 per cent. This year’s July RPI inflation figure meant that regulated fares would have risen by an average of 3.5 per cent in January 2015. Mr Osborne is also scrapping the ‘flex’ system where companies could raise some fares by up to two percentage points. He said more than 250,000 season ticket holders will save £75 across 2014 and 2015. But Mick Cash, acting general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: ‘The announcement from George Osborne does not stack up to a freeze for millions of people whose incomes are stagnant due to austerity.’","Government changes mean Northern rail customers face huge price hikes .

In the history of unlikely unions, Yorkshire and the Tour de France must be up there with Shane Warne and Elizabeth Hurley, Lyle Lovett and Julia Roberts, and Lembit Opik and one of the Cheeky Girls.

Yorkshire have embraced the honour in a way never seen before.The Tour colours — yellow, green and red polka-dots, representing each of the three main jerseys — are everywhere, decorating Yorkshire farms and even sheep. The county has caught yellow fever, with pubs adopting French names and Indian restaurants offering ‘naan Brad’, though the Brad being honoured, Wiggins, will be missing. France’s elite police force, the Garde Republicaine, will escort the race in Yorkshire, and on Wednesday they cruised in on their gleaming blue motorcycles, along  with  Tour director Christian  Prudhomme and five-time winner Bernard Hinault, France’s last champion, 29 years ago. Just as predictable as another year without a French winner is a pre-Tour drugs scandal, and on Wednesday it was duly delivered. Daryl Impey, the South African who rides for the Australian Orica-GreenEdge team, confirmed he tested positive for probenicid at his national championships in February. Impey, who had a spell in the yellow jersey last year, released a statement saying that he aims to clear his name. ‘I had no knowledge of probenecid nor have I ever taken the substance knowingly in any manner,’ he said. Ready: Sky employees from Leeds unveil the world's biggest jersey ahead of the 2014 Tour de France . Geared up: Yorkshire will host the Grand Depart, with Froome looking to retain his yellow jersey . Chris Froome, Britain’s defending champion, is a former team-mate of Impey, having ridden with him on the Barloworld team in 2008-09. They also know each other from South Africa, where Froome spent his formative years. ‘It was quite shocking this morning to hear the news about Daryl,’ said Froome. ‘It’s always harder when you know someone on a personal level.’ Froome has had his own problems in recent weeks. An illness at the Tour de Romandie in early May meant he raced on medication that would normally be banned, but which was allowed thanks to a therapeutic-use exemption. Then he crashed in his last outing before the Tour, the Criterium  du Dauphine, and suffered with the after-effects. ‘I’m more or less recovered,’ he said on Wednesday. ‘I took quite a big knock to my left hip and there was a bit of underlying bruising there. I felt for the next week after the crash I just wasn’t quite pedalling as I normally would. ‘It did take me a good week to get back into things, start seeing the same power readings as I would normally expect and be the normal me again. It was a reminder that anything can go wrong at any time, especially this first week of the Tour. It’s always a stressful environment being in the peloton over the first few days. I think given Yorkshire’s narrow, twisting, undulating roads on the first couple of stages it’s going to make for some pretty hairy racing.’ Absent: 2012 Tour winner Bradley Wiggins (centre) was not selected by Team Sky .

Froome leads a strong Team Sky line-up, albeit one without Wiggins. ‘Just to make absolutely clear, I do not have a role in selection,’ said Froome in response to a question about his famously frosty relationship with the 2012 Tour winner. Wiggins’ presence would ‘not necessarily’ be uncomfortable, added Froome, but ‘it would definitely change the dynamic having Bradley on the team. That’s bike racing: you’re not always going to be best friends with everyone on the team all the time. ‘The team that I have got around me,’ he added, ‘I would say it is probably the strongest team that Team Sky has fielded at the Tour de France.’","Official start of the Tour de France will take place in Leeds .

Detectives recovered a mobile believed to belong to Gerard ‘Hatchet’ Kavanagh from the murder scene at the upmarket resort of Elviria near Marbella. They  are now working through the numbers on it to see who called him before he died. The 44-year-old gangland enforcer was shot nine times in a professional hit just before 5pm local time on Saturday as he had a drink on an Irish bar terrace with an unidentified female. Murdered: Notorious Irish gangster Gerard 'Hatchet' Kavanagh (right) with boxer Jamie Kavanagh. Gerard Kavanagh was shot in Elviria, in Marbella, Spain on Saturday afternoon in an Irish bar  in a busy shopping area . Hit: Stills from news footage shows the victim's body being wheeled away. Kavanagh was shot nine times . The two killers shot him three times in the arm as they raced towards him, three times in the back as he tried to run inside the bar to safety and twice in the head as he collapsed in the doorway of Harmons Irish Bar. Witnesses have told police one of the two assassins, described as 'ninjas' because one was dressed from head-to-toe in black, stood over Kavanagh and fired a shot to the back of his head as he lay dead or dying. The pair escaped in a BMW they had left with the engine running near the bar. It is not known what happened to the woman. A car matching its description was found burnt-out shortly afterwards near a supermarket three miles west on the road towards Marbella. Forensic specialists were seen working on the car yesterday as detectives from a specialist anti-drug and organised crime unit continued to hunt for the killers. A stray bullet hit a car parked close to the scene of the murder. Police believe the victim may have been lured to the pub for the gangland-style hit . Cards placed next to potential evidence at the Irish pub, Harmons, in Elviria . A source close to the investigation said: ‘It was a professional hit. ‘He was shot nine times in the left arm, back and head but the killers fired off other shots that missed their target. ‘It sounds like the worst sort of violent Hollywood film. Anyone could have got caught in the crossfire.’ A stray bullet believed to have come from a gun used by the killers is said to have hit a car parked near the scene of the shooting. Witnesses to yesterday’s shooting have told police Kavanagh, known in west Dublin as a violent criminal whose main job was collecting drugs debts, was sat on a chair in a pair of green swimshorts talking to a woman when he was targeted. The burned out BMW X5, believed to be the getaway car, which was found torched three miles away . One said in the aftermath of the shooting: ‘The men rushed up to him from behind and shot him two or three times in the back and as he tried to run for the safety of the bar, finished the job off with a shot to the back of the head. ‘They turned him over to see if he was dead before fleeing. It was absolutely horrific. ‘The police took the dead man’s black Audi away and undertakers removed his body around 8pm.’ Another said: ‘The killers left the engine on their getaway car running. ‘I’ve been told it was found burnt out at a supermarket just down the road.’ A friend, who asked not to be named, said: ‘The dead man was lying face down just inside the door of the bar when I saw him. ‘He was dressed in just a pair of shorts and there was a lot of blood.’ Police have already seized CCTV footage from local businesses and are going over it for clues to the assassins’ identity. They also took away the black Audi Kavanagh arrived at the pub in. Witnesses have told detectives one of the men who shot the Irishman is blond and the other is bald and chubby. Harmons Irish bar, owned by boxing and Gaelic football fan Dave Harmon, remained closed today. No-one from the bar was available for comment. Police chalk marks, circling the spots where spent cartridges had fallen, were still visible inches from diners. Detectives are already probing possible links between the killing and shooting of ex-boxer and Sky pundit Jamie Moore near Estepona last month. Moore, 35, is thought to have been shot by mistake after coming to Spain to help prepare Birmingham-born boxer Matthew Macklin train for a fight in Dublin at his gym near Marbella. Blaze: The 4x4 was found near a supermarket three miles west on the road towards Marbella . Macklin, who has no involvement in crime, is a friend of the Kinahan family whose drugs cartel boss dad Christy is facing a money laundering trial in Spain with his two sons Daniel and Christopher after  police raids in May 2010. Kavanagh, who worked as an enforcer for Kinahan, had reputedly been embroiled in a drug feud between the ex-pat gangland figure and another Dublin gangster, Chris Russell, over a £1.2m debt. Russell’s home in Drimnagh is said to have been repeatedly targeted by Kavanagh and Paul Rice, another Kinahan enforcer. Detectives are now bracing themselves for a revival of the violent Costa wars of five years ago sparked by feuds on the streets of Dublin. Dublin gangster Paddy Doyle was murdered in a drive-by-shooting in Cancelada near Estepona in February 2008. Drugs boss Peter ‘Fatso’ Mitchell narrowly survived a bungled assassination attempt in August 2008 after a hitman tripped as he fired off four shots in a packed bar in Nueva Andalucia near Marbella. Expat father-of-four Richard Keogh, originally from Cabra, was shot seven times in January 2008 by a casino near the Costa del Sol tourist resort of Benalmadena. Bar owner Mr Harmon, from Dublin suburb Kimmage, last month retweeted a message wishing Jamie Moore a speedy recovery in hospital after he was shot on August 2. Officers at the scene. Police have already seized CCTV footage from local businesses and are going over it for clues to the assassins’ identity . Witnesses told police Kavanagh, known in west Dublin as a violent criminal whose main job was collecting drugs debts, was sat on a chair in a pair of green swimshorts talking to a woman when he was targeted . He also posted a picture of Irish boxer Jamie Kavanagh, who emigrated to southern Spain when he was 11, alongside a man believed to be convicted drug dealer Kavanagh. Locals described Mr Harmon as a lovely man and his bar as a ‘very nice place.’ One said: ‘It’s shocking that something like this has happened round here. ‘The killers picked a quiet time between lunch and dinner but three hours either side of the shooting and it would have been packed with tourists.’ Mr Harmon, who runs his pub with wife Tracey, were among Irish tourists caught in the middle of a huge wildfire near Marbella two summers ago. He told a paper at the time: ‘It was horrendous. ‘We were up all night. The place was like a zoo with everyone coming to the bar and bringing all their pets.’ Wife Tracey, who was evacuated from their nearby home and went to her bar to help customers and stranded members of their community, added: ‘We are at the bottom of a hill near the water and everyone congregated there. ‘They had nowhere to go. It was a massive evacuation.’ Harmons Irish bar, owned by boxing and Gaelic football fan Dave Harmon, remained closed today. No-one from the bar was available for comment . One travel review of their business describes Tracey as ‘gorgeous.’ Another, referring to the same eye-catching courtyard where Gerard Kavanagh was shot dead, says: ‘This well-known Irish bar in Elviria has a reputation as the place to be seen. ‘With lively karaoke each week night alongside their happy hour, there’s always a bustling atmosphere and lots of fun to be had at Harmon’s Bar. ‘Families are welcome as the courtyard out the back provides a safe place for children to play.’ A woman who answered a side door at the bar last night said: ‘Sorry we’ve got nothing to say. We’re not going to speak.’","Gerard 'Hatchet' Kavanagh was shot nine times by two assassins .

Naomi Broady will go into her second round clash with Caroline Wozniacki on Wednesday without the support of the Lawn Tennis Association — the issue having caused a deep rift in her family. Her father Simon has not spoken for nearly two years to her brother Liam, a former Wimbledon junior finalist now trying to make his way as a fully-fledged professional. Naomi’s exclusion from LTA support and funding has been well-documented following her first round win over Timea Babos. Hitting out: Naomi Broady has slammed the LTA over her treatment . Then and now: Broady back in 2007 (above) and (right) she celebrates with her niece after her famous victory . Father Simon was so enraged with the governing body’s over-reaction seven years ago to some harmless pictures on social media of a night out, that he cut off all contact with them. Simon, who did not respond to attempts to contact him on Tuesday, has long believed that the best way to achieve success in tennis is to not be part of any official system. He also kept Liam, at the time one of the Britain’s brightest juniors, away from any dealings with the LTA and sold his house to help fund his children’s careers. Having coached his son to some junior success, he fell out with Liam when his son decided to accept funding and coaching support from the governing body. They have been estranged ever since. Helping hand: Liam Broady receives funding and coaching from the LTA . Recently, Liam, 20, said: ‘I am quite a stubborn person and so is my dad.’ Liam is now based in London, where he trains out of the National Tennis Centre at Roehampton. After making the boys’ Wimbledon singles final in 2011 and winning the doubles title in 2010, he has made it to No 392 in the main world rankings. Competing in small Futures level events in America to develop his game, Liam is currently playing a tournament in Rochester, New York.

"By . Dominic King . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . It was the beginning of April and Everton, riding on the crest of a wave after a run of victories, were preparing for their biggest challenge of the season. Arsenal were due in town and as Roberto Martinez spoke about the problems he anticipated from the side who were going head-to-head for the final Champions League place, the conversation slowly turned to Arsene Wenger and managerial longevity. Wenger was in the middle of arguably the most testing spell of his tenure, while Martinez was being feted for transforming Everton’s fortunes. Having been linked with a number of positions, Martinez was asked how it felt to see his stock rise so much and whether that made him feel secure. Secure: Everton manager Roberto Martinez at Netherlands' World Cup training before his contract extension - a five-year deal worth £3m a year - was announced . His reply was laced with realism. ‘If I could control it I would love to start a project and develop it until you see you can’t take it any further,’ said Martinez. ‘Unfortunately in the modern game you can’t talk about that. You’ve seen Sir Alex Ferguson have 27 years and Arsene Wenger but you don’t see that sort of profile. ‘I think (that profile) is the success model in the game (but) there are too many influences nowadays. You’re always three defeats away from a sacking. In the modern game you would love to say if you do well you want to stay here as long as you can but you don’t know what is happening.’ For all that Martinez was being pragmatic, the reality was different. If he was to lose three games on the spin, his theory would not be tested as Bill Kenwright wouldn’t contemplate jettisoning him; Everton’s chairman and the board of directors know they have an impressive figure at the helm. It is why, in what promises to be a summer of new deals at Goodison Park, Martinez was handed new, lucrative terms after leading Everton back into Europe with a club Premier League record of 72 points on the back of some outstanding displays, such as the 3-0 dismantling of Arsenal. Model of success: Arsene Wenger's been in charge at Arsenal since 1996, a rare feat in modern football . Challenge accepted: Toffees loan star Romelu Lukaku scores in their 3-0 win over Arsenal in April . Elated: Everton pushed Arsenal for the final Champions League place but will contest the next Europa League . ‘Roberto undertakes his business with great style, confidence, positivity and class,’ said Kenwright, when announcing Martinez’s new five-year contract. ‘He is an Everton man. There is no magical ingredient to what we do at Everton. ‘We are a football club and recognise the fundamental importance of our manager.  When we find our man, we empower him. We support and provide him with everything at our disposal. We commit to our managers, and we’re immensely pleased that Roberto has committed to us.’ As Kenwight explained, taking over from David Moyes was not easy but Martinez’s relentless positivity, his unfailing optimism and unshakable belief in his methods have catapulted Everton forward and will be crucial in maintaining progress. Happy camp: Martinez is committed to his project at Everton and chairman Bill Kenwright is delighted with his work . Big shoes: Kenwright says replacing David Moyes was a tough task but his Spanish manager has flourished . Some would accuse Martinez of naivety in thinking Everton will be able to keep their place in the top five but he, for instance, would look at Chelsea spending £160million on new midfielders over the past 12 months and relish the challenge of trying to find a way to beat them. That, of course, is admirable but Martinez will know those who asked questions of him when he was appointed 53 weeks ago will do so again ahead of the new campaign: how will they juggle the demands of Europe? What if his movement in the transfer market is not as successful? What Martinez has in his favour, though, is the unshakable backing of his chairman. Kenwright absolutely made the right decision to appoint Martinez, who describes his support as 'incredible' and he made the right decision once again to reward his outstanding first 12 months. Big questions: Can Martinez do the same brilliant business that brought Lukaku to Goodison Park on loan? At home: Ideally, Martinez wants to see his vision through from start to finish, and at Everton he may get the rare chance to do that . A number of clubs, including Tottenham, would have liked to have taken Martinez away from Goodison but he has a vision for Everton – some of his plans include building living quarters at the club’s Finch Farm training enclave – and, crucially, a board that want him to see it through. ‘We want the best because only the best will do,’ said Kenwright. ‘Unswervingly, we trust Roberto Martinez to take our club forward.  To use one of his favourite words we are “excited” about our future.’ Martinez may be right in pointing out that the world football managers now inhabit is trigger-happy and can be horribly insecure but Everton are an exception to the rule. Kenwright wants Martinez to turn supporters’ dreams into reality. Quite simply, he will be able to stay as long as he wants.","Martinez signed a £3m-per-year deal with Everton to stay there until 2019 .

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . When it comes to choosing a home-grown apple, Peter Collett is spoilt for choice. For the 83-year-old has 50 varieties growing on a single tree. Mr Collett grafted buds from a range of apple plants on to an established specimen to produce the amazing tree. Scroll down for video . He has a total of 130 types of apple in a half-acre garden in Tangmere, West Sussex, that he has spent the past 30 years cultivating, including some of the rarest and most historic English varieties. He grows 30 other types of fruit including pears, plums, cherries, quince and pomegranate. Mr Collett, whose produce has won awards, is a member of the Royal Horticultural Society Fruit Group Committee and judges RHS competitions. One of the rarest apples in his orchard is Ashmead’s Kernel, first grown in Gloucestershire in the 1700s. Other varieties never seen on supermarket shelves including Howgate Wonder, Red Devil, Laxton’s Epicure, Spartan and Crawley Beauty. Among the smallest he grows is Api Noir, which dates back to Roman times. The retired headmaster first developed a love for apples during the Second World War when he spent his summer holidays picking fruit near his childhood home in Norfolk. ‘We were given extra-long holidays so that we could help bring in the fruit harvest,’ he said.

My grandfather and great-grandfather were gardeners so it was in my blood. That first taste of ripe fruits at the peak of their perfection will remain with me for ever. I vowed I would one day achieve the same results. Britain has hundreds of varieties of apple and they are all particular to a certain area so I started to grow apple trees that came from areas that meant something to me. Peter Collett marks each area of the tree with a tag (right) so that he knows which apple is which . ‘I have apples from Norfolk where I grew up, from Hampshire where I was a teacher and from Sussex where I live now.’ He and his wife Jean, who have four children, three grandchildren and a great-grandson, eat the fruits of his labour raw, baked or in crumbles.

"By . Marianne Power for the Daily Mail . From goji berries to acai, chia seeds to quinoa, every day there seems to be a new ‘superfood’ hitting the supermarket shelves. Each has huge health claims — promising to protect against everything from cancer to weight gain — and often a price tag to match. Not to mention a celebrity following. According to the British Dietetic Association (BDA), 61 per cent of people questioned had purchased a food just because it had been labelled a ‘superfood’. But what exactly is a superfood — and are they really all they’re cracked up to be? Nutritionist Ian Marber is sceptical: ‘There is no definition of a superfood, except that it’s a food with a marketing department,’ he says. ‘It helps when the food in question comes from an exotic, remote area and “has been widely used by tribesmen for thousands of years”. They tend to have a hefty price tag, which adds to the allure.’ Marber is not the only one with reservations. The EU has banned the term on packaging, unless it can be backed up with substantial science, and Cancer Research has deemed the phrase ‘just a marketing tool’. Even worse than the foods not living up to the hype, some claims have been made that, in high doses, these foods can actually be harmful, resulting in thyroid problems and arthritis flare-ups. Which? magazine says we could save up to £440 a year by ditching expensive superfoods in favour of old-fashioned, vitamin-rich foods such as kiwi fruit and broccoli. So just how super are superfoods? Scroll down for video . KALE . SUPER CLAIMS: The dark green leaves are loaded with vitamins, calcium, iron and other nutrients. NOT-SO-SUPER REALITY: The current fad for adding raw kale to everything from salads to smoothies means you are consuming compounds known as glucosinolates. In certain people these can interfere with thyroid function, enlarging it and causing a mass known as a goiter, in very high doses. Hormones produced by the thyroid control everything from fatigue to anxiety, and can even cause weight gain. IAN’S VERDICT: Kale is only considered to interfere with the thyroid when eaten raw, and you’d have to eat a lot for it to be an issue — one green smoothie a day isn’t going to hurt you. Better yet, cook it. when these vegetables are lightly steamed, this issue goes away, and they’re very healthy. GOJI BERRIES . SUPER CLAIMS: Goji berries have been a traditional part of Chinese medicine for centuries. Available in dried fruit or juice form, these shrivelled, red berries are alleged to boost the immune system and brain activity, protect against heart disease and cancer and improve life expectancy. NOT-SO-SUPER REALITY: The BDA argues that you would need to drink 13 servings of goji berry juice to get as many antioxidants as you’d find in one red apple. concern has been raised that goji berries are rich in a chemical compound called saponins, which increases the risk of a digestive syndrome called ‘leaky gut’, which may let toxins seep into the body. The berries may also interact with diabetes and blood pressure medicines, and have been linked to skin rashes. Finally, goji berries are part of the nightshade family of plants, which can cause inflammation and exacerbate conditions such as arthritis. IAN’S VERDICT: I would always go for fresh rather than dry berries, which have a higher ratio of sugar to fibre, and eat blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and blackberries for antioxidants — and a better taste. CHIA SEEDS . SUPER CLAIMS: These are from a mint-like plant that grows in Latin America. Weight for weight, chia has up to eight times more omega-3 than salmon, and the seeds are full of protein, minerals and antioxidants. They are also good for dieters, as they make you feel fuller. NOT-SO-SUPER REALITY: Chia seeds swell to a gelatinous mass in the stomach and can cause tummy aches, wind and bloating. They are also high in phytates, antioxidant compounds that have the potential to inhibit the absorption of certain minerals. They’re also very pricey: 500g costs up to £10. IAN’S VERDICT: Do you really want to eat 300g of chia seeds, or would you rather eat the salmon? QUINOA . SUPER CLAIMS: The South American supergrain (though it isn’t actually a grain, but a seed) contains up to 18 per cent more protein than any other grain, and amino acids to build muscle and body tissue. Naturally gluten-free, it’s low GI. NOT-SO-SUPER REALITY: Despite the protein, quinoa contains potentially gut-irritating saponins and lectins. Some report gas and bloating after eating it, which might be because of its very high fibre content. There are concerns about cross-contamination with wheat in the fields where it’s grown or in processing plants, which means it may not be as gluten-free as thought. IAN’S VERDICT: Quinoa is a great source of protein — the only concern I have is that so much of it is exported, the locals can’t afford to buy it in Peru any more. COCONUT WATER . SUPER CLAIMS: Coconut water has become Britain’s fastest-growing soft drink. It’s made by extracting the fluid inside unripe green coconuts. The drink is said to be high in potassium and magnesium. These minerals are depleted after exercise, so coconut water is often sold as a post-workout drink. NOT-SO-SUPER REALITY: While coconut water is relatively low in calories (around 20kcal per 100ml), most of these come from naturally occurring sugar. One 330ml serving contains three teaspoons of sugar, half your recommended daily allowance. A 2012 study concluded there was little difference between water, coconut water and sports drinks in promoting rehydration after exercise. IAN’S VERDICT: I like the taste, but it is no more hydrating than plain water — and far more expensive. ACAI BERRY . SUPER CLAIMS: With double the antioxidants of blueberries, along with protein, fibre, essential fats, vitamins and minerals, they are also touted as a weight-loss aid. NOT-SO-SUPER REALITY: The supposed weight-loss effect is unproven, and few scientific studies have tested the benefit of acai in promoting weight loss. IAN’S VERDICT: I don’t believe acai berries help you lose weight, and there is debate as to whether we benefit from ingesting such concentrated levels of nutrients in one go. WHEATGRASS . SUPER CLAIMS: Loved by everyone from Gwyneth Paltrow to Elle Macpherson, this liquidised or powdered grass is an ingredient in juices and smoothies. NOT-SO-SUPER REALITY: It doesn’t even contain enough nutrients to count towards your five-a-day. IAN’S VERDICT: Broccoli is a cheaper, easier alternative — it contains chlorophyll, vitamins A, C and E, iron and calcium, and is a fraction of the price.","According to the British Dietetic Association, 61 per cent of people had purchased a food just because it had been labelled a ‘superfood’

Hair loss is technically known as alopecia. There are two main types - areata, which is sudden, and androgenetica, which is the normal hair loss that men suffer and is sometimes known as male pattern baldness. Alopecia areata is divided into three types, depending on how much hair is lost. In its most common form, it results in patchy baldness on the scalp, leaving areas of bare skin which is smooth to the touch. Where the scalp loses all its hair, it is called alopecia totalis. Sometimes all hair on the body and scalp is suddenly lost, a condition known as alopecia universalis. Alopecia is not physically dangerous and does not cause any scarring - but it can be devastating psychologically. Alopecia can affect anyone: it occurs in males and females of all ages and races, although it tends to be more common in childhood through to early adulthood. Some studies have found that women are more likely to be affected by alopecia than men. The calendar is on sale in a bid to raise awareness and funds for a Alopecia UK .

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . You would think the point of a ‘race’ is to try to come first. But not if you’re entering this year’s ‘four-legged’ and wheelbarrow events at a Wiltshire village carnival - which have been hit by health and safety edicts. The four-legged race through the village of Pewsey - which sees teams of three competitors tying a leg to each other - has traditionally involved pit-stops at four pubs. Changes to the 2003 Licensing Act means that competitors in the races are not allowed alcoholic refreshments . But this year those trying to win the race will have to go teetotal if - according to police - they don’t want to fall foul of the Licensing Act, which bans the drinking of alcohol ‘at speed’. The organisers of Thursday’s event have decided that they are going to stay in line with the law to avoid the risk of prosecution, so competitors will have to stick to water or a soft drink. Those entering the wheelbarrow race the following Thursday will have to obey the same restrictions as they pass by the four pubs. But entrants for both events will be able to stop for as many drinks as they want, downed at whatever speed they wish, if they pledge to complete the course very slowly. ‘The races have been going for 33 years and we’ve only had one person fall out of a wheelbarrow which isn’t bad going,' said a local councillor . The snail’s pace events will start five minutes after the teetotal races. The drinking ban has angered some residents in the close-knit community where the two-week-long carnival has been going on for generations without any trouble. Jerry Kunkler, a Wiltshire Councillor and landlord of the village’s Moonrakers pub, said “It’s all to do with health and safety which I don’t always agree with. ‘We live in a nanny state and it’s the minority that the rules are in place for and the majority are the ones that have to pay. ‘The races have been going for 33 years and we’ve only had one person fall out of a wheelbarrow which isn’t bad going.” Organisers said on their website that the new rules had been drawn up for this year’s races following a meeting with Wilshire Police, Wiltshire Police Licensing Officer and Wiltshire Council. We're only here for the beer: Organisers said on their website that the new rules had been drawn up for this year’s races following a meeting with Wilshire Police, Wiltshire Police Licensing Officer and Wiltshire Council . The new stance has taken its lead from changes in 2009 to the 2003 Licensing Act which bans ‘irresponsible promotions’. In particular, they bar ‘any game or activity characterised by the consumption of alcohol at speed or within a prescribed time limit’. The regulations are aimed at discouraging promotions such as those involving downing ‘shots’ in club or pub contests. But the carnival race organisers were worried that with competitors charging along the streets, stopping frequently to down booze as onlookers cheered them on, he event could lay itself open to contravening the new laws. Entrants for both events will be able to stop for as many drinks as they want, downed at whatever speed they wish, if they pledge to complete the course very slowly . Organiser David Major said ‘It’s been a bit of a nightmare but we’ll just have to see how things go. ‘The changes have been coming in slowly of a period of years and we’ve just had to make this change to comply with the law. Where are you all coming from? We know where they are not going... to the pub, at least nor during the races . ‘We won’t know how it will affect entries until the day, but people have been talking about it, so hopefully everyone will still get into the spirit of things.’ Wiltshire police sergeant Vince Louge said ‘The races in the last few years have been extremely well run and there have been little, if any, problems. ‘The new rules are there simply to comply with new licensing laws and obviously we support that and the organisers have been very flexible in accommodating the changes.’","Four-legged race through the village of Pewsey traditionally involves pit-stops at four pubs .

"By . James Chapman, Daily Mail Political Editor . David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Gordon Brown will join forces this week to promise Scotland more powers from London if voters choose to stay in the UK. A cross-party plan for increased control over tax, welfare and job creation in Edinburgh would be announced ‘within days’, said Chancellor George Osborne. As polls point to a surge in support for independence, it was seen as a last throw of the dice for the No campaign – and immediately dismissed as a ‘panicky’ ploy by Alex Salmond. Scroll down for video . Gordon and Sarah Brown joke with Betty Birnie and Charlote McConnell yesterday as the no vote reached the former Prime Minister's hometown of Kirkcaldy . Mr Osborne said the final touches were being put to proposals for ‘much greater’ fiscal autonomy and tax-raising powers for Holyrood. However, there was scant detail – and it later emerged that plans will consist of a cross-party convention to hammer out agreement based on devolution proposals already unveiled by the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems. ‘You will see in the next few days a plan of action to give more powers to Scotland: more tax powers, more spending powers, more plans for powers over the welfare state,’ the Chancellor told BBC1’s Andrew Marr show. ‘That will be put into effect – the timetable for delivering that will be put into effect the moment there is a no vote in the referendum. The clock will be ticking for delivering those powers, and then Scotland will have the best of both worlds. ‘They will both avoid the risks of separation but have more control over their own destiny, which is where I think many Scots want to be.’ The move appeared to be an attempt to mirror the independence referendum in the Canadian province of Quebec in 1995 – when a shock lead by the Yes camp was overturned on polling day after a last-ditch promise of new powers. Chancellor George Osborne said the final touches were being put to proposals for ‘much greater’ fiscal autonomy and tax-raising powers for Holyrood . Both Ed Miliband, left, and David Cameron, right, will join forces this week to promise Scotland more powers from London if voters choose to stay in the UK . A new wave of devolution to Scotland will trigger fierce debate about whether England needs a mechanism to exclude Scottish MPs from voting on matters that no longer affect their constituencies – or even its own parliament. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones insisted that further devolution offered to Scotland should also be offered to Wales. However, Mr Salmond said the offer lacked any credibility, particularly as it came after postal voters in Scotland have already returned their ballot papers. ‘It shows the chaos, confusion and total disintegration of the no campaign, because quite clearly if you were serious . . . you would tend to announce it before people voted rather than after many people have voted,’ the first minister said. ‘This is a panicky, last-minute measure because the Yes campaign is winning on the ground.’ Scotland’s deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon claimed that it ‘increasingly looks as if the No campaign think people in Scotland are daft’. She said: ‘If the No campaign parties had any serious intention of delivering substantial new powers for Scotland, then why has it taken until ten days before polling day, with a poll showing Yes in the lead, for them to come up with this?’ A graph showing how the yes campaign has overtook the no campaign for the first time . Stockmarkers were braced for a nervous opening today as investors react to the surprise reversal of fortunes for Scottish nationalists. The pound could be under pressure after the Yes campaign took the lead in polls. Last Tuesday, the uncertainty pushed sterling 0.5 per cent lower against the dollar, hitting a five-month low. Firms with a large presence in Scotland could also suffer today over heightened fears that separation will disrupt businesses and cause costs to spiral. Drinks firm Diageo, which earns about a quarter of its £11.3billion annual sales from Scotch, is concerned a Yes vote could jeopardise European Union membership and international agreements on trade. Standard Life has also warned over the lack of clarity over what currency an independent Scotland would use, EU membership, and plans for financial regulation and taxation. Other big firms with a significant Scottish presence include drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline and BP which has warned that it might be forced to rethink investment in the North Sea. Howard Archer, a chief economist at research firm IHS Global Insight, said: ‘How much further the pressure on sterling ramps up will likely depend on whether polls continue to show the Yes vote improving. ‘The markets hate uncertainty, and it is now not only highly uncertain whether there will be a Yes or No vote in the Scottish referendum, but there is also massive uncertainty over as to whether or not the Scots will be able to keep sterling.’ Claiming there is ‘no guarantee whatsoever’ that Scotland would get a single additional power for its Parliament, she added: ‘I think the debate in Scotland has gone beyond the point where people can be fooled and taken in by empty promises from Westminster parties.’ But former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown hailed the prospect of more powers for Scotland, and derided the focus on personalities and TV debates. ‘This in the end is too important to be about the jokes that someone makes or the way that they make their argument or how they dress or what sort of presentational issues,’ he told Sky News’s Murnaghan programme. Mr Brown said he understood the ‘desire for change’ but urged Scotland not to take the ‘easy shortcut’ of independence. ‘ . The way to do it over these next few months is to elect a Labour government, to strengthen the Scottish parliament and make it more capable of doing the things we want to do,’ he added. Alex Salmond said the offer lacked any credibility, particularly as it came after postal voters in Scotland have already returned their ballot papers . With control over council tax and business rates, the Scottish Government currently raises about 15 per cent of its £30billion budget, with the majority of public spending funded by the UK Treasury. A radical plan by the LibDems would allow Holyrood to control 60 per cent of its revenue – with full control over inheritance tax, capital gains tax, income tax and a good share of corporation tax. Labour proposed increasing the figure to 40 per cent by allowing Scotland to control a 15p share of the basic 20p rate of income tax. The Tories would allow full control over all rates of income tax, with a reduced Treasury grant. VAT levels must remain the same under EU rules, but a share of the revenue from Scotland would be controlled by Holyrood. MSPs would also be allowed to ‘supplement’ welfare benefits. Mr Osborne also accused Mr Salmond of not ‘telling the straight truth’ about what currency an independent Scotland would use. He argued that a proposal to keep the pound would not be accepted by Westminster – likening it to a divorced couple continuing to share a bank account.","Cross-party plan for more control over tax, welfare and jobs to be announced .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Kids these days — they don't watch TV like they used to. That's at least according to one media analyst, who says the American television audience has aged sharply in recent years. Michael Nathanson, of Moffett Nathanson Research, said in a study released this week that the median age of viewers in the past year was 44.4 years old. The change represents a significant increase of 6 percent from just four years earlier, the Washington Post reported. CBS, with its hugely successful 'NCIS' franchise (pictured), has the oldest television audience, with median ages nearly 59 years old . Fox, whose primetime line-up includes 'Sleepy Hollow' (pictured), has the youngest viewership, about 48 years . That means the average television viewer is aging faster than the American population, at a rate of about 5 percent, Nathanson said. The increase is even sharper for people watching major broadcast network shows. For that group, the median age is nearly 54 years old, an increase of 7 percent from four years ago, according to the Post. CBS has the oldest audience, or about 59 years old.  Fox has the youngest, nearly 48 years. Nathanson points out to a number of reasons for the new trend. 'The shift in demographic viewing is caused by a combination of factors ranging from lower TV penetration rates of under-25 year old households to increasing use of time-shifting technologies in most under-55 year old households,' Nathanson wrote in his research, as reported by the Post. Some in the younger crowd like having control over when and where they watch programming, causing live viewership to drop 13 percent for all age groups except those 55 years and older. With those preferences, younger viewers tend to stick to on-demand offerings such as Netflix. Researchers say younger generations prefer controlling when and where they watch their favorite shows, giving preference to on-demand services like Netflix .","Median age of American audience is now more than 44 years old, increasing by 6 percent in just four years .

"By . Associated Press . and Chris Spargo for MailOnline . The father of a man fatally shot by police at a Walmart for holding a toy gun says a cellphone call in which he heard his son's dying breaths keeps replaying in his head. John Crawford Jr. talked about that last day of son's life to the Cincinnati Enquirer in a telephone interview from his home in Jackson, Tennessee, recalling how his son was 'gasping' for life. His son, John Crawford III, was shot Aug. 5 in a Walmart in the Dayton suburb of Beavercreek, Ohio. Scroll down for video . Dying words: John Crawford Jr. (above) says he heard his son 'gasping' for breath after he was shot by officers at a Walmart in Ohio . Officers have said Crawford III was shot when he didn't respond to orders to put down the gun he was holding, which they claim they believed was real. This all happened after a shopper contacted police to report that Crawford III was waving an A5-15 rifle at customers, including children. But footage of the 22-year-old proves he was in fact holding an unpackaged MK-177 BB rifle he had picked up in the store's toy department. The family has requested public release of the store video, but Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine has refused to release it while the investigation is continuing. Crawford Jr. said he was in Ohio the day of the shooting and had stopped by to see his son, who wasn't at his Fairfield home. The mother of his son's two young children was there talking on her cellphone to Crawford III, who was at the Wal-Mart shopping, according to Crawford Jr. He said she began screaming when she heard shots and put the call on speaker. 'You could hear in the background he was gasping,' Crawford Jr. told the newspaper. 'I'm virtually listening to my kid taking his last breath.' Victim: Crawford III, a father of two, was shot by officers while carrying a toy gun . Assistant Hamilton County Prosecutor Mark Piepmeier is now overseeing the investigation as special prosecutor. Piepmeier is scheduled to present evidence in the case to a Greene County grand jury this month. Jurors will determine if anyone should be charged in the shooting. But the parents of Crawford III and their attorney have asked the U.S. Attorney's Office to take over the investigation and determine if there were any civil rights violations. 'We do believe there was a violation of his civil rights and that does have to do with race,' family attorney Michael Wright said. Federal authorities have said they are monitoring the situation. Protest: Members of the Ohio Student Association gather outside Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine's office in Columbus, Ohio, to call for the release of in-store video in the fatal police shooting . Crawford Jr. described his son as a typical 22-year-old who was laid back and very family oriented. He had once considered going into the military and had recently said he wanted to start college, his father said. 'He was figuring out his next step,' Crawford Jr. said. The final autopsy report has not been completed, and Crawford Jr. said he has not been told which of the two officers involved shot his son.","John Crawford Jr. reveals he was on the phone with his son, John Crawford III, after he was fatally shot at a Walmart on Aug. 5 .

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . An adorable baby monkey rescued from animal traders selling it for cash has found a new family at a monkey sanctuary after being raised in a house. Marley, a vervet monkey, was only two weeks old when an anonymous woman saw him being sold on the street in Tanzania and gave him to wildlife worker Brittany Hilton. She then spent 24 hours a day with him and brought him up by hand in her home at the Dr Jane Goodall institute in Tanzania. Marley relaxing at the home of Brittany Hilton after an anonymous woman rescued him from animal traders . Brittany Hilton visiting Marley at his new home at the animal sanctuary, where he moved to after she hand raised him at her flat . But he's now been returned to live with other monkeys at an animal sanctuary and will one day be returned to the wild. Marley was just two weeks old when Ms Hilton first met him. The woman, who had bought him from street traders in Daar es Salaam in an attempt to rescue him, gave him to wildlife centre the Jane Goodall Institute where Ms Hilton works. It's not uncommon for mother monkeys in Tanzania to be killed so that their babies can be sold as pets. The Canadian-Norwegian sanctuary worker became his adoptive mother, bottle-feeding him until he could eat fruit on his own and never letting him leave her side. While staying at Dr Jane Goodall's house, whatever she did, Marley did too and he spent most of his time sitting on her shoulders while she cooked, cleaned and even went to the loo. Ms Hilton raised Marley (pictured) by hand at her flat at Dr Jane Goodall's house in Tanzania . Monkey selfie: Marley pictured making a mess during meal times with his carer Brittany Hilton . Just four months later though, she faced the trauma of giving away the baby monkey she had now come to think of as her own. When the moment arrived for Marley to rejoin other monkeys in the Makoa Farms sanctuary just south of Mount Kilimanjaro he was reluctant to leave his new mother's arms. She had to spend four days helping him integrate into the troop of rescue animals. But now Marley is at home with the other monkeys and thriving in his natural habitat. Brittany Hilton (pictured) said Marley was 'an amazing little guy' and was happy to hand raise him . Ms Hilton said: 'Although it was heartbreaking to have to let Marley go I'm happy for him and would do it again and again. 'Marley was an amazing little guy. He made our lives so much better. Every day I spent with Marley was the best day I had ever had. 'He was cheeky and full of life and personality, but he was so soft and sometimes he would just be clinging to my shirt and staring up at me, and feel my face with his hands in such a loving way. 'I am sure he's not the last monkey I will save. 'Marley is free and where he belongs back in the wild. 'He is doing so well at the sanctuary that he is a perfect candidate for a full release into the wild which is so amazing and exactly what our goal is: less monkeys in cages and sanctuaries and more monkeys in the wild where they belong. 'I couldn't be happier with the outcome of Marley's story and hope it serves as a lesson to anyone who thinks a monkey is a pet. 'They are not pets, they are not ours to keep. 'There are thousands of Marleys out there, and they all begin with a horror story. 'The men kill the mother to get to the baby. The fear and horror that baby monkey must feel in those moments is unfathomable.'","Marley, a vervet monkey, was saved from animal traders on the streets .

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . Outspoken: British hate cleric Anjem Choudary has described the Islamic State as the sort of society he would 'love to live in' with his family . British hate cleric Anjem Choudary has described the Islamic State as the sort of society he would 'love to live in' with his family, while insisting that he does not know  terrorist beheader 'Jihadi John'. The radical activist said he admired the makeshift state set up by militants in Syria and Iraq, believed to be home to several million people. However, the 47-year-old said that while he views his British passport as nothing more than a travel pass, he would not move to Syria as he was born in Britain, and that if he were to try he would be arrested by British police. 'From what I understand from people living there, they have security, schools are now being set up where their children are taught about Islam, and they have the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter,' he told The Observer newspaper. 'They don't see in the public arena things like alcohol, drugs, gambling, these kinds of vices. They've been completely wiped out. I think in many respects it's the kind of society I'd love to live in with my family. Many people I know think the same. That doesn't mean that we're going to train and come back and carry out operations here.' More than 500 young British Muslims are thought to have left the UK to fight for jihadi groups in Iraq and Syria over the last three years. A 2013 report by campaign group Hope Not Hate labelled groups linked to Choudary as the 'single biggest gateway to terrorism in recent British history', and claimed he was the link between groups who encourage the safe passage of British and European Muslims into Syria where they join Al Qaeda-linked forces. It also suggested that he should be considered a 'serious player' in the promotion and recruitment of young Muslims to terrorist cells. According to the study, organisations affiliated with Choudary have encouraged in the region of 80 young British Muslims to join the fighting in Syria and may also have had a hand in the recruitment of 300 more on the continent. Previously, the father-of-four from Leytonstone in East London has made statements about how he would like to see the Prime Minister David Cameron and the American President Barack Obama killed. Scroll down for audio . Unknown: Choudary insists he does not know terrorist beheader 'Jihadi John', seen in the brutal beheading video of journalist James Foley . Terrorist: The man, who speaks with a London accent, was seen holding a knife in both of the shocking videos, his face hidden with a scarf . No information: Choudary said he knew nothing of the capture of British aid worker David Haines . He is also known to have links with Michael Adebolajo, the Muslim convert who murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby. However, Choudary has always been carefiul not to break the law and has never been charged or convicted of a crime related to terrorism. He has only ever been fined £500 by the authorities - which came after he organised a protest outside the Danish embassy in London over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. Choudary insisted that he does not know the British terrorist nicknamed Jihadi John, and seen in the brutal videos depicting the beheadings of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. The man, who speaks with a London accent, was seen holding a knife in both of the shocking videos, his face hidden with a scarf. 'I'd recognise his voice if it was someone I knew,' he said. Without giving his backing to the killing, Choudary said there were crimes which, under sharia law, were dealt with using capital punishment. The former lawyer added:'If you look at the death of James Foley, you only have to listen to the person who is executing him to know that the blame is the Americans' because of their own foreign policy. The fact is that decades of torture, cruelty and mass murder will have repercussions.' He also said he had no information about the capture of British aid worker David Haines, 44, who is being held hostage by extremists, and has been earmarked as the next victim, following the deaths of Mr Foley and Mr Sotloff. A former leading member of the banned extremist organisation Al-Muhajiroun and an ex-spokesman for Islam4UK, Anjem Choudary is known for his outspoken criticism of the UK's wars with Iraq and praise for those responsible for the 9/11 and July 7 attacks. He referred to the September 11 terrorists as 'magnificent martyrs', and refused to condem those behind the London bombings in July 2005. In September 2006, Choudary was investigated by the Metropolitan Police over comments made during a protest about Pope Benedict XVI. Controversial: Choudary during a demonstration outside Regents Park Mosque in July last year . The pontiff had cited the 14th-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, stating: 'Show me just what Mohamed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.' The speech was criticised by many Muslims around the world, and at during the protest outside Westminster Cathedral, Choudary had told reporters: 'Whoever insults the message of Mohammed is going to be subject to capital punishment.' Police concluded that 'no substantive offences' had been committed during the protest. Choudary, who believes Sharia law should be implemented in the UK, is also credited with helping to convert Lee Rigby's killer Michael Adebolajo to Islam. In an interview with Radio 4 in December last year, he repeatedly refused to condemn the killing, insisting David Cameron and British foreign policy were to blame for the soldier’s death. He added that he was ‘very proud’ of Adebolajo as ‘a practising Muslim and a family man’, but ‘differed’ with him about the interpretation of Islam which he used to justify the murder. He has also attacked the charity Help for Heroes, which helps care for injured British soldiers, saying they cannot be heroes because they 'shoot children in Afghanistan', and in the past has planned to disrupt the minute's silence on Remembrance Sunday. Choudary has previously beeen warned by the Metropolitan Police that he is 'constantly' under surveillance to see if his comments are breaking the law, but has never been charged or convicted of a terrorism-related offence. Last February has was secretly filmed saying Islam will overrun Europe, David Cameron and Barack Obama should be killed and calling the Queen 'ugly'. However, when asked about the footage he said he had been 'joking', and his words had been misconstrued.","Activist says he admires the makeshift state set up in Syria and Iraq .

"By . Melissa Hills For Daily Mail Australia . Calum Shand, 26, found it very hard to get a job when he returned to Australia from working in the UK . A student who made 80 different versions of his CV to try and find a job has called for all higher education facilities in Australia to offer work experience placements to better prepare students for the work place. Calum Shand, 26, from Melbourne, studied a graphic design course at college before going to the UK to work for a shoe company in their marketing and design department. With youth unemployment at an all time high when he returned to Australia he says he found it impossible to find a job in design and ended up managing a fashion store temporarily while he sent out applications. 'In those two years I must have applied for over 80 jobs and that was from barista positions to junior design positions,' Mr Shand told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is more important than ever that all higher education establishments have work placements in their courses so these students can be properly prepared for the workplace. 'When I got back to Melbourne I found that the competition was high for jobs so I knew I needed my BA to be given a chance, even though I had had bits and pieces of work over the years. 'I knew the store I worked in was not a stable job, but I used my time there to talk to people and make contacts. 'I actually got quite a lot of freelance work from there.' While working at the shop Mr Shand got talking to a lecturer from the Billy Blue College of Design based in Melbourne. He told Mr Shand about the 'alternative approach' the college offered and he later enrolled on a Bachelor of Arts in Communication Design and will soon graduate. Mr Shand says he sent off more than 80 applications in the two years he was job hunting before his degree . 'Most of our lecturers are actively working in design, which makes the whole experience more meaningful and relevant as we can keep up to date with what's happening,' he said. Mr Shand is now studying in a 'functional studio' and building industry connections – something that is invaluable for designers. The college also has lots of work experience programmes built into their courses to prepare students for the work place. New research shows that youth unemployment is climbing, reaching as high as 20 per cent in some areas of Australia. Mr Chand added: 'It is getting harder for young people to find jobs and sometimes it is like full time job trying to find a job. 'It takes an enormous amount of time to apply for jobs. I made 80 different versions of my CV and tailored them all to different jobs. You have to make your applications stand out.' Data from the Department of Education shows that up to 30 per cent of university students are out of work four months after finishing their degree. Linda Brown, CEO of Think Education says there is an 'experience shortage' in Australia . Youth unemployment hit a 12-year high in June and a growing number of people in part-time jobs say they are not working enough hours, ABC reported in June. Youth unemployment is climbing, reaching as high as 20 per cent in some areas. Linda Brown, CEO of Think Education and who has 24 years experience, which runs Billy Blue College of Design, says the problem isn't a skills shortage but an 'experience shortage', and that we need to be rethinking education to ensure students are 'work ready'. Think Education has carried out research and found that he top three things young Australians want from their education are knowledge and skills that lead to a job (37 per cent), a broad and varied knowledge (26 per cent) and a recognised qualification (19 per cent). Ms Brown told Daily Mail Australia: 'I was surprised with the results,  one of the the key points was that just 61 per cent felt empowered by their education. 'At Think Education we make sure every student has work experience built into their courses. 'We are working in partnership with education and businesses. 'They need to work together, it's an experience shortage. 'The students need to get that experience and it can be by volunteering or just liaising with employers. 'Students need to have the education as well as the vocation and they need to be able to learn with passion.' Billy Blue College of Design in Melbourne where Mr Shand has just finished studying . A student taking a practical approach to learning at Billy Blue College of Design in Melbourne . A spokesman for Senator Kim Carr, Shadow Minister for Higher Education, said: 'The quality of university teaching and learning is an important issue. 'A high-quality university education includes many elements, including the acquisition of knowledge, student satisfaction and engagement, and employment readiness. 'Australian universities are amongst the best in the world, but their capacity to get better and deliver better outcomes for graduates is under threat. 'The Abbott Government's plans to impose massive cuts on universities, along with increased fees and compound interest on student loans will hurt and hinder this effort.' Education minister Chris Pyne said his government would be carrying out surveys this year . Mr Pyne told Daily Mail Australia the government would be carrying out 'surveys for higher education, that cover the student life cycle from commencement to employment'. He said they would be carrying out specific surveys in university experience, graduate outcomes ad employer satisfaction and the results would be out in August 2015. 1.

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . More than 200 years after the original was wrecked at sea, a life-sized replica of the Hermione has embarked on a series of sea trials to prepare for its maiden transatlantic voyage. The replica of the French navy frigate that shipped General Lafayette to America in 1780 tested the waters for the first time today after her careful construction lasted 17 years. The three-masted ship departed a harbour in Rochefort, France in a major step toward its voyage to the US, where it will follow in the footsteps of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette in April 2015. C'est magnifique: A life-sized replica of French navy frigate the Hermione has set sail for the first time . Return to glory: The back of the 213ft-long frigate, a replica of the original, is pictured at a harbour in France . Completed in 1779, the original Hermione is famous for ferrying General Lafayette to America to lead rebels fighting British troops in the US War of Independence. The wooden replica was built with 18th century shipbuilding techniques and materials - from the pulley systems to the massive oak hull - and cost a staggering £20million to complete. It was financed by the shipyard’s four million visitors and crowd-funding efforts. Its construction began in 1997 after a group of enthusiasts formed the Hermione-Lafayette Association, attracting artisan craftsmen from across Europe. Benedict Donnelly, the association’s president, the Agence France-Presse: ’It is an important step to sail Hermione at sea, which no one has ever done. ‘There is real pride in the collective force behind this project. There have been tense moments, but we remained united.’ What a sight: The original Hermione carried General Lafayette to America in 1780 . Maiden voyage: The replica will sail to the US in April 2015 once sea trials and final preparations are finished . Labour of love: The wooden replica was built with 18th century shipbuilding techniques at a cost of £20million . After departing Rochefort, the new version will make its way to the Atlantic Ocean, where it will spend several weeks partaking in sea trials while based at Ile-d’Aix. Thousands of people queued along the Charente river to catch a glimpse of the 213ft-long frigate, whose departure was delayed until today due to a build-up of sediment. It was a moment nearly two decades in the making. Towering ship: Thousands of people turned out to get a look at the Hermione in Rochefort, France . Aye aye, captain: Yann Cariou, an ex-naval officer, will captain the frigate for its maiden voyage to the US . Once the sea trials are complete, the Hermione will displayed to the public in Bordeaux for nearly a full week in October before returning to Rochefort to prepare for its journey overseas. The replica will follow the same route that General Lafayette took, with an arrival in Yorktown, Virginia scheduled for June 2015. Yann Cariou, an ex-naval officer, will captain the frigate for its maiden voyage to the US. The original was wrecked at sea in 1793. Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, better known as General Lafayette . General Lafayette cemented his place in history by having a significant hand in the ousting of monarchies and creation of new regimes in America and France. He became one of the most important figures in the US War of Independence (1775 to 1783) before he played a pivotal role in the French Revolution (1789 to 1799) in his home country. Born into the wealthy Motier family, known by their ancient noble title of La Fayette, he joined the military at a young age and later became a hero in both America and France as he fought alongside the American colonists in key battles against British troops. In April 1780, he arrived aboard the frigate Hermione in command of French forces – marking his second trip to America during the war – and was put in charge of the defence of Virginia with the rank of major general. Lafayette, a close friend of George Washington, the American commander in chief, employed strategies that eventually drew British commander Lord Charles Cornwallis into a trap at Yorktown, Virginia, allowing the united French and American forces to defeat him. Cornwallis’ surrender brought an end to the war, paving the way for American independence. When he returned to France in 1782, Lafayette was celebrated as ‘the hero of two worlds’ and given the rank of brigadier general in the French army. In the following years, he aligned himself with the revolutionary bourgeoisie and became one of the most powerful men in France during the first few years of the French Revolution. With France bordering on political and social upheaval, Lafayette served as a leader of the liberal aristocrats and an advocate of religious toleration and the abolition of the slave trade. He was elected as a representative of the nobility to the States General but supported the bourgeois deputies of the Third Estate in their efforts to gain control and convert the States General into a revolutionary National Assembly. He joined the National Assembly and drafted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. He was appointed commander of the newly formed national guard of Paris and his troops saved Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette from a mob that invaded Versailles in 1789. They became hostages of the revolution. Lafayette supported measures that transferred power from the aristocracy to the bourgeoisie while attempting not to protect the constitutional monarchy. But he fell out of favour and was forced to resign when about 50 demonstrators demanding the abdication of the king were killed by his guards in the Champ de Mars massacre in 1791. Lafayette became a commander of the army as France went to war with Austria but after the monarchy was overthrown and he refused to serve the National Convention he was declared a traitor and was forced to defect. He was held captive by Austrian forces until Napoleon Bonaparte secured his release, and he returned to France in 1799. After the monarchy was restored in 1814, Lafayette sat in the Chamber of Deputies during most of King Louis XVIII’s reign and in 1830 he commanded the national guard that helped overthrow King Charles X and install Louis-Phillippe on the throne, although he later became disillusioned with the new king. Lafayette, long regarded as a symbol of friendship between France and America, died in May 1834 following a battle with pneumonia. -Encyclopaedia Britannica .","Replica of the Hermione embarks on sea trials before transatlantic journey .

Some 3,000 people – many of them professional bakers – develop occupational asthma each year. Charity Asthma UK has warned that amateurs who catch the baking bug from the BBC show could be next. Scroll down for video . Risk: The popularity of The Great British Bake Off could be putting home bakers at risk of asthma triggered by flour dust, warn experts. Above, Mel Giedroyc (left), Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood are seen on the programme . The warning follows new data showing flour has been identified as the main cause of occupational asthma in France. It was the trigger for one in five cases of the condition in a nation famed for its baguettes, says a study presented at the European Respiratory Society's International Congress yesterday. Occupational asthma usually results from breathing in substances known as 'respiratory sensitisers' over a period of time at work. In some people, these substances cause asthma symptoms. This can lead to severe chronic asthma if exposure to the sensitiser continues. Condition: Occupational asthma usually results from breathing in substances known as 'respiratory sensitisers' over a period of time at work. In some people, these substances cause asthma symptoms . In the UK, the top cause of occupational asthma is a group of chemicals called isocyanates used in spray painting, foam moulding and metal casting. Dust from flour and grain is another major cause, mainly affecting bakers, farm workers and grain transporters. But home bakers could be at risk, said Samantha Walker, Director of Research and Policy at Asthma UK. Babies who sleep on fur are less likely to develop asthma, say scientists. Early exposure cut the risk by up to three-quarters, a German study found. Infants who slept on animal fur for three months had extra protection until at least age ten. It is believed the practice primes the immune system for later life, the researchers said at the European Respiratory Society’s International Congress. Dr Walker said: 'Baking is not only a career but it is also a hobby enjoyed by millions of people in the UK, as we have seen with the popularity of the Great British Bake Off, and this study highlights just how important it is that occupational asthma is taken seriously. 'An estimated 3,000 new cases are reported in the UK each year and bakers are about 80 times more likely to develop occupational asthma than the average worker due to exposure to flour and other bakery dusts. 'We urge anyone who regularly bakes, or who is a baker by profession, and who has experienced breathing problems to discuss these with their GP.' The French study, the largest of its kind in the country, looked at 330 cases. Flour dust was blamed for 20 per cent of these, while ammonium compounds often found in cleaning products caused 15 per cent. Women were significantly more likely to be diagnosed than men. Rates were higher among skilled and unskilled workers (116 per million) when compared with farmers (97 per million). Next? Some 3,000 people – many of them professional bakers – develop occupational asthma per year. Charity Asthma UK has warned that amateurs who catch the baking bug from the BBC show (pictured) could be next . The highest rate was found in people working in the manufacture of food products and beverages, with 279 cases per million people. Professor Frederic De Blay, lead author from the University Hospital Strasbourg, said 'This study has given us a detailed understanding of the occupational asthma cases in France. 'It helps to show us where people are being exposed to harmful agents and who is most likely to be affected. 'These findings are important as they can help with future prevention methods to make sure people who are at risk of occupational asthma are protected from it.'","The Great British Bake Off may be putting home bakers at risk, warn experts .

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Tory MPs have begun canvassing each other over whether David Cameron should be sacked if Scotland votes for independence, it has emerged. Over the weekend, the influential 1922 Committee representing backbench Conservative MPs contacted MPs to ask whether Mr Cameron could stay in his job in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote. The Prime Minister has insisted he would ‘emphatically’ not resign if he lost Scotland. The Chancellor George Osborne has also dismissed the suggestion that Mr Cameron’s position would be in question in the event of separation. But Mr Cameron may face an immediate vote of no confidence and a leadership challenge. Labour leader Ed Miliband would also be under pressure having lost a key heartland – and more than 40 MPs. Scroll down for video . A yes vote on Scottish independence will plunge David Cameron  into a leadership crisis that could force him to quit . Under Tory Party rules, a vote of no-confidence in Mr Cameron would be triggered if at least 15 per cent of the party’s MPs write to Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee requesting one. Some 46 MPs would have to write letters to trigger a vote. ‘The move will take place immediately,’ said one senior Tory MP told the Financial Times. ‘David Cameron will be unable to contain the anger at the humiliation. His position will be terminal.’ Some Tory MPs claim Mr Cameron gave too much ground to Alex Salmond in negotiations over the referendum. The PM is accused by some of mistakenly agreeing to the Scottish referendum’s timing and the wording of the question on the ballot paper. But Downing Street sources have insisted the SNP was elected with a clear majority in the Scottish parliament and had said it would hold a referendum. After this it would have been ‘unthinkable’ for Mr Cameron to have told the people of Scotland they could not have a referendum, they said. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former Tory foreign secretary, claimed the real blame for losing Scotland would fall on Labour. He said Tory supporters were solidly behind the No campaign while polls show up to 35 per cent of Labour voters could vote Yes. Sir Malcolm said: ‘I think that up until now he’s done all he could have done and was advised to do. You can hardly blame the prime minister for Labour people deserting their own party.’ Gains: Scotttish First Minister Alex Salmond, pictured at Peterhead Fish Market this morning where he had a Q&A session with fishermen, has made major gains with his dream of an independent Scotland . Yesterday, there were claims that at least two ministers in the Government would feel bound to resign if the Scots vote yes – a move that would pile pressure on the Prime Minister. Some MPs who are plotting against Mr Cameron’s leadership are also understood to have discussed the possibility of mounting a challenge to him in the event of a Yes vote. One former minister said: ‘It will be a cataclysm that will eclipse everything else for years to come and it is very hard to see how Cameron could survive it.’ Last month the former Tory leadership contender, David Davis, said Mr Cameron said Mr Cameron would be ‘humiliated’ if Scotland voted to leave the UK.

The Prime Minister is planning one more visit to Scotland between now and polling day on September 18. It will be dominated by a commitment to give more powers to the Scots if they vote no and an ‘emotional’ case for the continuation of the Union. Will Hutton, an economist and former government adviser, said: ‘Both party leaders are in a lot of trouble. The shockwaves from this will go through every institution in the country.’","Senior MPs say the end of the 300-year-old union would cripple his authority .

The teenage Muslim boy wears all black and and a headscarf around his face. The photograph is captioned with a chilling message 'going to kill Bashar al Assad now'. Political leaders have spoken out in outrage over the auction of the flag at  Liverpool’s Markaz Imam Ahmad mosque and youth centre. Premier Mike Baird told the Daily Telegraph that the government would not tolerate any action that gave comfort to terrorists. The teenage boy wears all black and and a headscarf around his face.

'I note Islamic State is listed by the Commonwealth government as a terrorist organisation and that it is against the law to provide it with any support,' he said. 'We expect everyone in New South Wales to obey the law or face the consequences. All parents and all communities need to protect young people from the insidious and corrosive effects of the radical ideologies that are causing so much suffering around the world.' Unfortunately New South Wales Police are unable to do anything about it as the objective of the auction was stated to raise money for the mosque. If the money was being used to fund a terrorist group it would only then constitute as a crime. A new push for a change in laws may be on its way making it illegal to promote and incite terrorism.","A flag used by terrorist group Islamic State has been auctioned off at a mosque in Western Sydney .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . This orangutan certainly wasn't monkeying around when it came to this dangerous river crossing. These incredible photos how brainbox Mego used a long, staff-like stick to literally test the waters - finding out whether the river was too deep to cross. He looks almost human as he prods the branch into the river, before wading his way in. Scroll down for video . Testing the waters: Mego the orangutan checks the depth of the river with a stick before crossing . Mego was rescued by the Nyaru Menteng Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre after three years living as an illegal pet and spent 13 years in a rehabilitation programme in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. He was released into the wild earlier this year but he appears to have picked up tricks from his human carers. One of the teams from the Nyaru Menteng was monitoring Mego's progress when they spotted him at the bank of the Joloi River with a long branch. Not af-wade: Mego does not mind getting wet as he wades across the river, trusty stick in hand . He carefully inserted it into the water to measure the depth then, after realising it was safe to cross, made his way in. But unluckily, Mego lost grip of the branch and watched it float away. The clever animal then realised it would be unwise to cross the river without it, and reluctantly turned back. Dr Grainne McEntee, Head of Operations for Orangutan Protection Foundation in London, a charity which raises funds for the orangutan release programme at Nyaru Menteng, said the animal's behaviour was not a surprise. 'The great apes are considered to be the most intelligent animals, other than humans, and orangutans are regarded as the smartest amongst primates,' she said. 'Sharing 98 per cent of our DNA, their similarity to us is remarkable - they're adaptable and innovative, and there's rarely an obstacle they cannot overcome.'","Mego was rescued by the Nyaru Menteng Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre .

Change: Members of the group 'English Scots for YES' hold a tea-party near Berwick-upon-Tweed on the border between England and Scotland yesterday . A survey in May suggested about 66 per cent intended to vote No on September 18. Naomi Stewart, 32, a Yes supporter who is originally from Devon but has lived in Scotland for ten years, said: ‘I stay in Lanarkshire now and it’s incredibly deprived. I desperately want life breathed back into it. ‘Scotland deserves to be run by a Government that cares about its people.’ An estimated 370,000 English-born people are eligible to vote in the referendum .

There are an estimated 4,300 French, 3,600 Italians, 3,000 Spaniards, 2,700 Latvians and 2,600 Lithuanians.

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . Dinosaurs walked the earth about nine million years earlier than once realised, with recent discoveries of their cat and dog-sized ancestors providing the key to understanding their evolution. Research has revealed small creatures which roamed the earth 245million years ago are likely to have been the immediate ancestors of dinosaurs such as the Tyrannosaurus rex and velociraptor. One of these is a labrador-sized carnivore, first discovered in Africa, which had a metre long tail and lived alongside other reptile-type species 243million years ago. Nyasasaurus, pictured in the foreground, was an ancestor to the dinosaurs and about the size of a labrador . The footprints of another were discovered in a Polish quarry. This creature, from around the same time period, was the size of a house cat and is also thought to be part of the dinosaur lineage. Paleontologist Richard Butler, from the University of Birmingham, wrote in a research paper that the recent discoveries of what were called 'dinosauromorphs' have 'placed the Polish Triassic record as a key to understanding the ascent of dinosaurs'. He added the Polish quarry footprints, which he worked on, 'may provide a new frontier in understanding the evolution of early dinosaurs'. The dated footprints shifted the origin of the dinosaur back to between 249 - 251million years ago, which was up to nine million years earlier than indicated by dinosaur body fossils and footprint records. It was also only a few million years after the Permian/Triassic mass extinction of 252million years ago. The upper arm and six vertebrae of Nyasasaurus, which was found in Tanzania in the 1930s . The fossilized upper arm and six vertebrae of Nyasasaurus, were found in what is modern day Tanzania, Africa, in the 1930s. Nyasasaurus, which means 'Lake Nyasa lizard', was named after the lake in the region known as Nyasaland when it was a British colony until 1964. They date from just a few million years after the 'Permo-Triassic mass extinction', the greatest of all time, and provide important insight into the origin and early evolution of dinosaurs. All life on Earth today is descended from the four per cent of species that survived the mysterious event 252 million years ago that may have been caused by an asteroid impact or volcanic eruptions. The extinction was caused by a volcanic eruption, which in turn triggered global warming and a climate which wiped out 96 per cent of all living species. It was during the planet's recovery from this event that dinosaurs flourished before their extinction about 65million years ago. Mr Butler wrote in a recent blog: 'Although most attention has been focused on the dinosaur extinction, arguably a more interesting question is how and why the dinosaurs became so successful in the first place.'","Dinosaurs evolved from small cat and dog-sized creatures 249m years ago .

We understand each other.’ Budd wrote to Dennehy, from Peterborough, in April with pictures of his Staffordshire Bull Terrier named Chunky, and she replied with stories about her German Shepherd named Hitler. He popped the question in a letter in July, and she wrote back: ‘I would marry you in a heartbeat.’ Dennehy - who is already now signing her letters with the name ‘Joanna Budd-Dennehy’ - added: ‘You dress as Elvis and I’ll wear the canary suit. I’ll walk down the aisle to Jailhouse Rock.’ Budd was convicted of grievous bodily harm at Guildford Crown Court in Surrey in 1990 but received a reduced sentence after saying sorry to his victim, reported The Sun on Sunday. Elvis-themed wedding: Dennehy now plans to marry Budd at HMP Bronzefield (file picture) in Ashford, Surrey . He and Dennehy plan to ask the Prison Service for permission to marry at HMP Bronzefield in 2015. Budd, who claims on his Facebook profile to have a daughter named Leah-Jo, attended Steyning Grammar School and Midhurst Grammar School in West Sussex, and is from Shoreham-by-Sea. The tattooed builder is pictured wearing a . Manchester United football shirt on his profile and has posted images . of publicity posters for white nationalist group the British People's . Party. 'We've both been through a lot. We understand each other' James Budd, Dennehy's fiancé . In his ‘About Me’ section, he says: ‘I am a 47-year-old father of a 16 year old daughter and currently single. I live on my own (hallelujah). ‘My best friend is my dog, a lunatic Staffy cross rescue dog, who thinks what's mine is hers (including my freaking bed). 'Have spoilt her rotten as she is the only female who has never let me down, answered me back or taken up with someone else. ‘Live a very boring life, same s*** . every day. I don't drink but do smoke. I don't involve myself in other . people’s bulls*** and don't expect them to get involved in mine. ‘I . am polite and well-mannered but cross me and you “will” get f***** up . for your troubles. Revenge is always best served cold and anonymously. Treat me as you would wish to be treated yourself.’ Killed: Dennehy fatally stabbed friend Lukasz Slaboszewski (left) and housemate John Chapman (right) in 2013 . Budd then rants about wanting to 'stand and fight back' to immigrants in Britain who 'hate us'. Dennehy became only the third woman in UK legal history to be handed a whole life sentence after she confessed to a triple killing, with the judge branding her 'cruel, calculating and manipulative'. Dennehy fatally stabbed Lukasz . Slaboszewski, Kevin Lee, and John Chapman last year - before Stretch . drove her to Hereford where she randomly stabbed two dog walkers, who . both survived. 'You dress as Elvis and I’ll wear the canary suit. I’ll walk down the aisle to Jailhouse Rock' Joanna Dennehy . A month-long trial heard that accomplices Gary Stretch, 47, and Leslie Layton, 36, were in the ‘thrall’ of Dennehy, who had already admitted the three murders and two attempted murders. She ‘exploded’ into violence last March, first killing friend Mr Slaboszewski, 31, after luring him to a house by text.  She killed her housemate Mr Chapman, 56, and Mr Lee, 48, her married landlord and lover, ten days later. All . three victims were stabbed through the heart and their bodies dumped in . ditches. Stretch then drove Dennehy 140 miles to Hereford where she . stabbed Robin Bereza, 64, and John Rogers, 56. Both . suffered critical injuries but survived. Stretch and Dennehy were . arrested that day. In the police custody suite she joked to officers . about her ‘hectic week’. Stabbed through the heart: Dennehy also killed Kevin Lee (pictured), 48, her married landlord and lover . While Stretch had driven Dennehy around and helped her pick victims, Layton joined him in helping to dispose of the bodies. Both claimed they had been acting under duress. As well as Stretch’s convictions, Layton was convicted of perverting the course of justice and two counts of preventing a lawful burial. A third accomplice, Robert Moore, 56, . who also lived in Peterborough, sheltered Dennehy and Stretch for a . night and had admitted assisting Dennehy. 'You are declaring yourself to be the soulmate of a notorious serial killing psychopath. Lol. Not exactly girl next door' Joanna Dennehy . Dennehy is only the third woman to be given a whole-life prison term – along with Moors murderer Myra Hindley and House of Horrors serial killer Rose West – and the first to be given the term by a judge. Hindley and West were both handed the sentence by home secretaries. The Old Bailey was told the killer had a ‘sexual and sadistic motivation’. Later she told a psychiatrist: ‘I killed to see how I would feel, to see if I was as cold as I thought I was. Then it got more-ish.’ Experts said Dennehy craved notoriety and wanted to humiliate her victims through sick sex games. Before the killings she had boasted she had already killed four times. Stretch was jailed for life for two counts of attempted murder and preventing the burial of three people. He shouted ‘thank you very much’ after being told he would serve a minimum of 19 years. Layton was jailed for 14 years and Moore for three years.","Joanna Dennehy describes herself in letter as 'not exactly girl next door'

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . Once the European hub of grandeur and wealth, the canals of Venice have long accommodated adoring tourists from all over the world. But for one day each year, the famous waterways play host to a stunning recreation of the lagoon city's history with a colourful pageant of opulent gondolas. The vessels, used in the past to demonstrate the Italian city's power and riches, sailed past cheering crowds today as part of the Regata Storica, an annual procession of boats which takes place on the first Sunday of September. Scroll down for video . A small fleet of gondolas sail under Rialto Bridge on the Grand Canal as part of the annual Regata Storica - an annual pageant which recreates the tradition of parading barges and boats once enjoyed by leaders of the ancient Republic of Venice . Rowers in period dress lead the procession aboard the Bucintoro (pictured) once used to transport the Doge and his wife, along the Grand Canal past St Mark's Basilica. The Flag of Veneto is hoisted at the boat's hull in a nostalgic nod to the former republic . Dating back to the 15th century, the pageant commemorates the arrival of Caterina Cornaro, the wife of King James II of Cyprus, to the floating city in 1489. Following her arrival, every year the procession continued as a display of the city's wealth, surviving the dissolution of the Republic of Venice and abdication of its last Doge, Ludovico Manin, in 1797. Leading the procession is the Bucintoro, once the barge of the Doge - the leader of the Republic - and his wife. Adorned in gold and red velvet robes, men in period dress stand in as the leader and his close circle of officials at the boat's hull, with the Flag of Veneto separating them from a team of rowers. Starting at St Mark's Bay, gondolas of varying size and colour sail down the Grand Canal, passing beneath its Rialto Bridge as crowds gather on floating stalls. After the breakdown of the Republic in 1797 two citizen races were introduced to the festivities. Today, four events take place with competitors separated by age and vessel. Aboard the Bucintoro, a small band of trumpet players herald the beginning of the procession. A large Flag of Veneto trails behind in the water as crowds gather on rickety wooden planks and floating stalls . Spectators gather on Rialto Bridge to watch the pageant pass beneath them. The procession is followed by four competitive races in which gondoliers show off their rowing skills . The races, designed to showcase gondoliers' skills, start in front of Sant'Elena Gardens which is signposted with a rope - the spagheto. A turning post in the centre of the Grand Canal marks the half-way point, with the finishing line marked by a colourful floating stage where victors claim prizes. Among the races is one for children, rowing on a two-oared gondola, and a six-oared event for barges. The most popular  is the twin-oared gondolini race, during which rowers whiz from St Mark's Bay down the Grand Canal, passing beneath Rialto Bridge and around the paleto of Santa Lucia railway station.

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . Sir Cliff Richard has firmly denied the allegation of sexual assault . Sir Cliff Richard has no idea who is behind an allegation of sexual assault but has vowed to continue working to clear his name. The accusation, first revealed on August 14, prompted controversy after it was revealed the BBC and South Yorkshire Police cut a deal which tipped off the BBC to a raid on Sir Cliff's home. Now a friend has now reportedly said Sir Cliff, 73, wants the accusation to be dealt with as soon as possible so he can get on with his life. His friend told The Mirror: 'He doesn’t know his accuser. He has no idea when his ordeal will end.' He added Sir Cliff had told his friends the accusation was unfounded. Sir Cliff told them: 'Nothing will come out of the woodwork because I’ve absolutely nothing to hide.’ Detectives swooped on his £3.1million apartment in Berkshire last month amid accusations he sexually assaulted a 15-year-old schoolboy at a Christian rally almost three decades ago. And just three days ago Sir Cliff - who is currently staying at his holiday home in the Algarve, Portugal - released a statement on Facebook vowing to clear his name. In it he thanked members of the public, fans and 'those in the press' for their support. He wrote: 'Hi everyone, this is just a brief message to thank all of you who have shown support, including those in the Press. 'I wanted to let you know that I'm doing ok and it goes without saying that I fully intend to clear my name. 'Just to be absolutely clear, the allegation is completely false and I will continue to cooperate with the police should they wish to speak to me again. Once again...many thanks!' It was the second public statement he has made since the allegation was first revealed. His first comments came on August 14, in which he acknowledged 'completely false' claims of 'sexual impropriety' had been circulating online for months. He stated: 'Up until now I have chosen not to dignify the false allegations with a response, as it would just give them more oxygen.' In a reference to the BBC's coverage of the raid, he added: 'However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except it would appear to the press.' Scroll down for video .

During a Home Affairs Select Committee hearing, chairman  Keith Vaz told South Yorkshire Police Constable David Crompton his committee was amazed at what appeared to be 'sheer incompetence' in dealing with the matter. The BBC and South Yorkshire police clashed over how TV reporters were able to film live aerial shots of the search last month. Mr Crompton said the BBC put his force in 'a very difficult position' after confronting officers with leaked information about the planned search in connection with allegations of a historic sexual assault. He added his force was convinced that the broadcaster would run a story about the investigation without some kind of deal. Committee MP Julian Huppert asked Mr Crompton if the compromise was a common method in dealing with the media as opposed to a  'rather remarkable blackmail attempt'. But the BBC flatly rejected the accusation and claimed they would have pulled the story if the police had asked.

"By . Trevor Quinn At Mailonline . Taking the leap and getting a tattoo or a piercing while on holiday may seem like an exciting and exhilarating idea, but an Australian medical expert is warning travellers to be aware of hepatitis B and C risks in the Asia-Pacific region. Hepatitis Australia CEO Helen Tyrell has told the Courier Mail that medical experts are anticipating a rise in the number of Australian people contracting hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) during the coming years. She says their pessimistic outlook is based on the lifestyles of holidaymakers and their destination choices. The prevalence of hepatitis C in some Asia-Pacific countries is 10 times higher than it is in Australia . There is currently a vaccine for HBV, but health experts are concerned by the lack of a vaccine for HCV, which is known as 'the silent killer'. Many who contract the virus have no symptoms for years and even decades before the virus attacks their liver, which can lead to serious health difficulties. Victims often suffer from serious liver damage while the risk of cancer is also increased. Holidaymakers should be safety conscious and careful. Ms Tyrell said: 'What we want all Australians to know before they head off on their overseas holiday is that any activity in which the skin is pierced can lead to infection with hepatitis - and, yes, that can include pedicures, tattoos and piercings, and even getting dental work done abroad.' She said the disease is contagious and it can be easily passed on from one person to another. She states if an instrument containing a microscopic amount of infected blood is used to pierce the skin or comes into contact with an open wound it has the potential to transmit the disease. Experts are anticipating a rise in the number of Australians contracting hepatitis B and C in the coming years . The Hepatitis Australia CEO also warns: 'Don't engage in activities in which the skin may be pierced unless you're sure the instruments have been fully sterilised.' Ms Tyrell lists countries in the Asia-Pacific region such as Bali, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines as places where the prevalence of hepatitis C can be 10 times higher than Australia. She says inadequate and poor sterilisation of instruments in tattoo parlours or during pedicures are primarily to blame. 'People on holiday can be more likely to make a spur-of-the-moment decision to take part in more risky activities, like getting a tattoo, so what we're urging Australians to do is pre-plan. 'If you want to get a tattoo or a piercing while you're away, do your research so you can better know your risk. Ask yourself, does the place sterilise its equipment properly? Does the benefit really outweigh the risk?' Stay on your toes: Health experts are warning travellers to be aware of the risks of hepatitis C and C . The latest research shows that Australian tourists are far more likely now to engage in risky pursuits which puts them at greater risk of contracting hepatitis B and C viruses. Ms Tyrell believes this is due to a lack of public knowledge about the ailments. She advises anybody who is anxious that they may have hepatitis B or C to talk to their GP as a matter of urgency. Intravenous drug use is the most common way that the viruses are spread, however, hepatitis B and C can also be contracted by using items such as toothbrushes, razors and nail clippers. Last week Ms Tyrell welcomed the decision to add simeprevir (Olysio) to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. There is currently a vaccine for HBV, but health experts are concerned by the lack of a vaccine for HCV . In a press release issued by Hepatitis Australia, Ms Tyrell said: 'The use of simeprevir as an addition to pegylated interferon and ribavirin to treat people with genotype 1 hepatitis C is an important step forward in the evolution of hepatitis C treatment.' Ms Tyrell said simeprevir will improve the treatment process as it will make it safer and she called for the therapy to be listed on the PBS as soon as possible. The CEO also criticised the Pharmaceutical Benefit Advisory Committee (PBAC) for their decision to decline an application to subsidise sofosbuvir (Sovaldi), an antiviral medication. She said: 'It's a sad day when access to game-changing therapy is denied. This is a bad outcome for people living with hepatitis C.'","Lifestyle choices and holiday destinations to blame for likely increase .

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Harry Potter author JK Rowling has attacked the ‘ranting’ debate over independence . Harry Potter author JK Rowling has attacked the ‘ranting’ debate over independence which has seen support for independence surge. The English-born writer, who sparked anger among nationalists after donating £1million to the ‘No’ campaign, called for calm amid growing tensions between the rival campaigns ahead of next week’s referendum. Scottish MP Jim Murphy was forced to pull out of a campaigning tour against independence amid intimidation tactics by separatists. Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone meanwhile has claimed she no longer feels safe in Scotland because of the abuse she has received after speaking out against independence. The Glasgow-born and based Ultimo founder was subjected to a vitriolic social media hate campaign after becoming one of only a few business leaders to come out in favour of the Union. Miss Rowling said not all nationalists were ‘haters’ – but called for a more reasoned debate before the September 18 poll. Her intervention come after a poll put the Yes campaign in the lead for the first time, sparking panic in Westminster. A YouGov survey for the Sunday Times found that the pro-independence campaign, led by the Scottish first minister Alex Salmond, had a two point lead of 51 per cent over the unionists’ 49 per cent. On Saturday, however, Rowling wrote on Twitter: ‘People before flags, answers not slogans, reason not ranting.’ Miss Rowling has previously accused Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond of ‘scaremongering’ over the threat to the NHS in Scotland if it stays in the UK. Mr Salmond has claimed the health service can only be protected from ‘privatisation’ in an independent Scotland, even though policy is already fully devolved to Edinburgh. Miss Rowling is married to Dr Neil Murray, a former hospital doctor in Edinburgh who is now a GP, and has donated millions of pounds to tackling multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases. In June she was subjected to a torrent of online abuse by Scottish nationalists after giving £1million to the No campaign. Miss Rowling’s latest intervention came as leading Scottish footballers declared their support for a No vote in the referendum. The players, who include former Scotland internationals Ally McCoist, Alan Hansen and Denis Law, said: ‘We are proud that Scotland has always stood on its own two feet but we also believe that Scotland stands taller because we are part of the United Kingdom.’ Scroll down for video . Labour MP Jim Murphy was forced to pull out of his campaign tour against independence after being pelted with eggs by 'Yes' campaigners . Mr Murphy was heckled by angry nationalists on the campaign trail in Kirkcaldy . Three former British ambassadors have also urged Scottish voters not to ‘return to the tribe’ as an isolated nation on the world stage. In an open letter, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, former Ambassador to the United Nations, Sir John Holmes, former Ambassador to France, and Sir Nigel Sheinwald, former Ambassador to the United States, warn that Nato and the EU ‘will not hugely welcome’ an independent Scotland. Independence will cost investment and cause ‘massive upheaval and risk for both Scots and all other Britons’, they say.","JK Rowling has attacked the 'ranting' debate over independence .

The 29-year-old had been relaxing by the beach in Italy with friends in preparation for today's race in Monza, where he beat Mercedes team-mate and rival Nico Rosberg. He was seen relaxing on board a boat, racing a jet-ski and even taking to the water on a surfboard. Scroll down for video . Lewis Hamilton leaps off the top a rocky cliff, jumping into the sea below while on holiday in Sardinia earlier this week . The 29-year-old was in Sardinia preparing for today's Italian Grand Prix, which he won, beating Nico Rosberg . Onlookers were then shocked to see the driver clamber to the top of a cliff edge alongside a friend before leaping off into the sea . But, onlookers were then shocked to see the driver clamber to the top of a cliff edge alongside a friend before leaping off into the sea, only wearing a pair of swimming shorts. One witness told the Sunday People: 'It was a real shock to see Lewis Hamilton jumping from the rocks. 'He's one of the most famous sportsmen in the world and you don't expect to see him doing something like this. 'He may put his life in danger every time that he takes part in Formula 1. But you know that racing drivers have taken every safety precaution possible.' It is thought his jump is likely to have caused concern for his Mercedes team bosses, who would have urged him not to take part in any dangerous activity. Lewis Hamilton, who was relaxing on a beach in Sardinia earlier this week, decided to clamber to the top of a rock with a friend . The 29-year-old was also pictured on board a boat with friends during his time off in Sardinia . As well as jumping from the cliffs, he also tried his hand at racing a jet-ski in the water . The driver, who is the boyfriend of popstar Nicole Scherzinger, also gave surf boarding a go while on holiday . The craze of jumping from cliffs, piers or harbour walls into the water below, which is nicknamed tombstoning, is a fad that has swept across Britain over the last ten years. The name is said to come from the aim of entering the water upright and straight, like a tombstone. According to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, since 2004 they have dealt with over 200 incidents of tombstoning in the UK, which has caused 20 deaths and 70 injuries. The add that of those injured, the youngest was 12 and the oldest was 45. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution have both launched various campaigns to try to stop such tragedies. They warn of the changing tides, which make it difficult to gauge water depth, as well as the dangers of hitting submerged objects or being dragged under by unexpected currents. Winning today's Italian Grand Prix means that Hamilton has narrowed the gap at the top of the World Drivers Championship . He beat Nico Rosberg, left,  who has been at odds with his Mercedes team mate after they collided with one another during the Belgian Grand Prix . Although tombstoning is not illegal, police have also tried various initiatives to discourage it, including safety events that spell out its terrible hazards. The driver, who is the boyfriend of popstar Nicole Scherzinger, took time out to relax in Sardinia in preparation for today's Italian Grand Prix. Winning the race now means he has narrowed the lead of team-mate Nico Rosberg at the top of the Driver's World Championship to just 22 points with six races to go. In the last race, the Belgian Grand Prix, Rosberg collided with Hamilton, forced him to retire while he finished second to extend his championship lead. There have been a series of incidents involving in the pair this season including when they refused to shake hands despite completing a Mercedes one-two at the Monaco Grand Prix, with Hamilton unhappy at the pit stop strategy his team adopted.","Driver had been relaxing in Sardinia ahead of today's Italian Grand Prix .

"By . James Chapman for the Daily Mail . Nick Clegg is to announce new plans that could see free TV licences and winter fuel payments stripped from well-off pensioners . Free TV licences and winter fuel payments would be stripped from hundreds of thousands of well-off pensioners to subsidise bus fares for under-21s in Lib Dem plans being unveiled today. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will insist benefits for 'the rich and retired' are unjustifiable as he launches his 'pre-manifesto' for next year's general election. The Lib Dems say they will withdraw the perks from all pensioners in the higher-rate tax band, affecting more than 600,000 who pay tax at the 40p rate. The cuts would save £125million a year, the Lib Dems said, which would give all those in England aged 16 to 21 a bus pass entitling them to two-thirds off tickets. The Lib Dems and Labour are committed to scrapping perks for better-off pensioners – one of dozens of policy areas where they agree, paving the way for a potential Lib-Lab coalition next year. Most of the Cabinet is also thought to favour cutting universal benefits for pensioners at the election, Government sources say, and research for No 10 suggests the majority of voters back the idea. Mr Clegg will say today: 'Young people are required to stay in school until they are 18, but we haven't done enough to give them the support they need to do that – literally to help them get from A to B. 'I know there are people who say you mustn't touch so-called universal pensioner benefits because politically it's too risky. We don't agree: what are effectively benefits for the rich and retired cannot be justified when there are so many young people struggling to get on their feet.' The move would be delivered by bus operating companies, who would then be reimbursed by local government, the Lib Dems added. The party earlier announced it would abolish the married tax allowance to fund free childcare for every two-year-old in England if they are in government after next year's general election. The plan is a central plank of around 300 policies being unveiled Mr Clegg under the slogan 'Stronger Economy, Fairer Society', and is likely to be a sticking point for the party in any coalition negotiations if the election result is inconclusive.

Activists will be able to amend the policies and, while their votes are not binding, it is unlikely the leadership would press ahead with any which are roundly rejected. Lib Dems would guarantee to extend the 15 hours a week of free childcare, currently available to two-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds, to all two-year-olds by the end of the parliament in 2020 - with the ambition of achieving it within one or two years .","Deputy PM will insist benefits for the 'rich and retired' are unjustifiable .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Nasa has spoken out on the controversy surrounding a strange 'glow' spotted on Mars - and says it is either a shiny rock or a glitch in the Curiosity rover's camera. UFO blogger Scott Waring claimed that the new photograph taken by the rover suggests there are intelligent creatures living underground. However, Nasa says it has now investigated the image, and found it is simply a trick of the light. Scroll down for video . Life on Mars? In this photo taken by the Curiosity rover a light of unknown origin can be seen in the distance . 'One possibility is that the light is the glint from a rock surface reflecting the sun,' a Nasa spokesperson told MailOnline. 'When these images were taken each day, the sun was in the same direction as the bright spot, west-northwest from the rover, and relatively low in the sky. 'The rover science team is also looking at the possibility that the bright spots could be caused by cosmic rays striking the camera's detector.' Nasa's engineers believe the glow may have been caused by sunlight reaching the camera's sensors through a vent hole in the camera housing. The agency says this has happened previously on other cameras on Curiosity and other Mars rovers when the geometry of the incoming sunlight relative to the camera is precisely aligned. Nasa also revealed the glitches are commonplace. 'Among the thousands of images received from Curiosity, ones with bright spots show up nearly every week.' Enhance: Closer up it's not any clearer what the light source is, but it's probably just an anomaly in the photo . The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 2,000lb (900kg). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. The Curiosity rover is currently exploring an area of Mars known as ‘the Kimberley.’ Named after a region of western Australia, the area sees four different types of rock intersect and is scientifically fascinating. The particular spot the rover is in ‘gives us a great view for context imaging of the outcrops at the Kimberley,’ Melissa Rice of the California Institute of Technology said in a release. Over the next few weeks, Rice will be leading the science for the rover as it drills and analyses rocks at the location. But it’s not the fact that a car-sized vehicle is exploring an alien world 57 million miles (92 million km) away that piqued the interest of the OFU community. Rather, what appears to be an anomaly in a photo has caught the attention of him and other UFO enthusiasts. ‘An artificial light source was seen this week in this NASA photo which shows light shining upward from… the ground,’ Waring wrote on his website. ‘This could indicate there is intelligent life below the ground and uses light as we do. He goes on to claim: ‘This is not a glare from the sun, not is it an artifact of the photo process. ‘Look closely at the bottom of the light. ‘It has a very flat surface giving us 100 per cent indication it is from the surface. Now you see it, now you don't: In a image taken by Curiosity's other camera at the same time the bright spot has disappeared, suggesting it was merely a glint or an artifact in the first photo . ‘Sure Nasa could go and investigate it, but hey, they are not on Mars to discover life, but there to stall its discovery.’ According to NASA, however, the bright spot is not that unusual. Curiosity takes images using two cameras, one in its right eye and the other in its left. While the image from the right eye shows this bright spot, the same image from the left eye does not. Ben Biggs, editor of All About Space magazine, says we should not jump to any conclusions when seeing images like this. 'While the ""light"" is as yet unexplained, it's quite a leap to assume that it has an intelligent source,' he says. 'The public can afford to speculate wildly but Nasa is an organisation internationally renowned for credible science. 'It needs to exhaust every other likely explanation before it can begin to explore less realistic phenomena.' Curiosity has been operational on Mars since August 2012 and is now on its way to Mount Sharp. This 'find' came a few days before Curiosity celebrated a Martian year - 687 Earth days - on 24 June, having accomplished the mission's main goal of determining whether Mars once could support life . This is not the first time a photo from Mars has incorrectly caused some to declare we’ve made first contact. One famous occurrence was the ‘Face on Mars.’ On . 25 July 1976 Nasa’s Viking 1 orbiter released an image of a region . called Cydonia that seemed to show a human face on the Red Planet. In . reality it was nothing more than a phenomenon known as pareidolia, . where the human brain picks out faces in an object, in this instance a . chance aligning of shifting sand. In . 2006, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) imaged the region and again . and showed that the sand had continued shifting, erasing the ‘face’ from the surface. In 1976 the Viking 1 orbiter snapped an image of a region of Mars that looked like a human face (left), leading some to claim it was a sign of intelligent life, but 30 years later it was proven to just be a sand dune (right) Over the next few weeks the Curiosity rover will perform some of its most extensive investigations on Mars since it landed in August 2012. Once it has examined this region of Yellowknife Bay it will continue its journey to its ultimate destination of Mount Sharp. This fascinating geological region will provide scientists with a multitude of data about the history of the Red Planet. And they may even be able to prove that the planet was once habitable enough for life to exist. But it’s unlikely they’ll detect any life currently residing on Mars.","Nasa photo appears to show an artificial light on the Red Planet .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . Crowds gathered to watch the historic moment the world's last two airworthy Lancaster Bombers flew over Windermere today. Spectators lined the shores of Windermere to see the momentous event of the two Second World War planes flying together. The special flight was organised by Robert Johnstone as a surprise for his father, Archie, to celebrate what would have been the war veteran's 100th birthday. Scroll down for video . Crowds watched the historic moment the world's last two airworthy Lancaster Bombers flew over Windermere, in Cumbria, today . The Lancaster Vera (pictured) has been joined by the Lancaster Thumper at various events over the past few weeks - marking the first time the two Bombers have flown together in 50 years . The fly-over is part of a tour that will culminate in a Battle of Britain Memorial Flight at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, on Sunday September 28 . The Lancaster Vera - built two years after the raids, in 1945 - was acquired by Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in 1978 and underwent a 10-year restoration . The special flight was organised by Robert Johnstone to commemorate his father, Archie, who was a navigator in 617 Squadron of the RAF, which has become known as the 'Dambusters' squadron . Archie, from Grange-over-Sands, was a navigator in 617 Squadron of the RAF, which has become known as the 'Dambusters' squadron, who took out the feared Tirpitz battleship in a daring raid over Norwegian fjords. His son, Robert, from Lancaster, had arranged a fly-past of his nursing home on his birthday today - but he passed away in April. As such, the flight was moved to Brockhole Visitor Centre - where Archie and Robert would often visit for days out - to commemorate the war hero. Elsewhere, there were 1940s-themed games and historical scenes from the front line. The fly-over is part of a tour that has seen the two aircraft appear in a series of air shows and events around the UK over the last few weeks. It has been sponsored by the Blackburn brewery, which brews the popular Lancaster Bomber ale. It will culminate in a Battle of Britain Memorial Flight at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, on Sunday September 28. Over the past few weeks, the Lancaster Thumper, which is part of the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial flight, has joined the Canadian Lancaster Vera from a museum in Ontario. Lancasters are perhaps best known for their use in the historic Dambusters raids of 1943, when the RAF’s 617 Squadron used ‘bouncing bombs’ to destroy dams that helped power German industrial plants in Ruhr. The planes have appeared in a series of air shows and events around the UK over the past few weeks . Farewell flights: The Canadian Lancaster - pictured soaring above the UK - is in Britain for the final time . 19 Victoria Crosses won by men of Bomber Command, including Guy Gibson, who led the Dambusters raid. 125,000 Bomber Command air crew serving during World War Two. 55,573 Died in action, with a death rate of 44 per cent. 9,838 Bomber crew became prisoners. 1.3m Tons of Allied bombs on Germany. More than 7,377 Lancasters, 430 of which were built in Canada, were built during the Second World War but many that survived were scrapped. It was the most successful bomber used by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force. In 1940, Prime Minister Winston Churchill threw his support behind the Royal Air Force's Fighter Command and the development of Bomber Command, stating: 'The Navy can lose us the war, but only the Air Force can win it. 'Therefore our supreme effort must be to gain overwhelming mastery in the air. 'The Fighters are our salvation, but the Bombers alone provide the means of victory.' The Lancaster Vera - built two years after the raids, in 1945 - was acquired by Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in 1978 and underwent a 10-year restoration. Vera - dedicated to Andrew Mynarski, the last Canadian airman to be awarded the VC in World War II – made the long journey to Britain from its base at the Ontario's Warplane Heritage Museum at the beginning of August. Honoured: Andrew Mynarski was the last Canadian airman to be awarded the Victoria Cross in the Second World War . 'Probably the most famous Allied bomber of the Second World War, the Avro Lancaster had impressive flying characteristics and operational performance,' the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum says on its website. The plane is dedicated to the memory of Pilot Officer Andrew Mynarski who was awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Canadian Mynarski won the award on June 13, 1944, when his Lancaster was shot down in flames by a German night fighter during the Second World War. As the bomber fell, Mynarski managed to free the tail gunner trapped in the rear turret of the blazing and out-of-control aircraft before he died. The crew member survived and lived to tell the tale, resulting in the Victoria Cross being awarded in 1946 - the last such award to a Canadian airman in the Second World War. The Lancaster bomber, which has flown in the UK the last few weeks, was dedicated to Mynarski, and is referred to as the 'Mynarski Memorial Lancaster'. It is painted in the colours of his aircraft KB726 – VR-A, which flew with RCAF Squadron. In 1952, it suffered a serious accident and received a replacement wing centre section from a Lancaster that had flown in combat over Germany. It served as a maritime patrol aircraft in Newfoundland for many years and was retired from the RCAF in late 1963. With help from the Sulley Foundation in 1977, it was acquired from the Royal Canadian Legion in Goderich, Ontario, where it had been on outside display. Eleven years passed before it was completely restored and flew again on September 24, 1988.","Spectators lined the shores of Windermere, in Cumbria, to watch the world's last two airworthy Lancaster Bombers .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . General Sir Peter Hall warned British Army does not yet know full strengths and abilities of Islamic State . Britain should not enter a conflict with Islamic State fighters as we do not know the full scope of their strengths, an army chief has warned. General Sir Peter Wall, Outgoing Chief of General Staff for the British Army, said the Government should not rush to intervene in the ongoing brutality being carried out by the 'grotesque' militants as it does not yet have a full understanding of the group's 'capabilities'. Likening the situation to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, he added the only thing worse than reacting too quickly would be to not react at all. 'Isil has committed grotesque acts of terrorism, but I am not what kind of understanding we have of their strength and capabilities,' he told the Telegraph. 'We have to be very careful that we do not get sucked into an international conflict without having a proper understanding of the situation on the ground... we were found wanting in these respects in Iraq and Afghanistan and it took some time to get things right.' David Cameron has shied away from offering any definitive plans but has dismissed notions of sending British troops to fight in the war-torn Syria and Iraq. Sir Peter's comments come as a branch of the extremist militants publicised the beheading of a Lebanese soldier this weekend, posting photographs on Twitter which are believed to depict the murder. Abbas Medlej, 20, was among at least 19 Lebanese soldiers kidnapped by Sunni militants when they stormed a border town in Syria last month. The soldier, a Shiite Muslim, is thought to have been killed after trying to escape captivity. American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were both slaughtered by the extremist group, with footage of their murders circulated around the world. They were both kidnapped earlier in Syria while reporting the ongoing conflict. At least 29 people were killed in the Syrian city of Raqqa on Saturday as a result of government airstrikes. Comments come after the believed beheading of a Lebanese soldier at the hands of IS militants. Abbas Medlej was reportedly murdered by the group after trying to escape captivity. If verified, photographs of the beheading would be the third circulated on social media by the organisation . An IS fighter carries the group's sinister flag - its motto translating from Arabic as 'There is only one god' President Assad's army has sought to regain control of the region since it was taken by IS militants earlier this year. At least 20 civilians died alongside nine extremists when eight blasts tore through the city which has a population of around 500,000. In a separate incident, Iraq's airforce killed at least 22 following airstrikes on a hospital. The attack near Kirkuk city is one of a series of raids by war aircraft in the area according to witnesses.","General Sir Peter Wall warned we don't know full scope of IS abilities .

"By . Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . For the first time, James Ashby - the man who filed sexual harassment claims against Peter Slipper two years - has personally detailed the allegations he brought against his former employer. During his first week on the $160,000 job as Mr Slipper's adviser in 2010, Mr Ashby was asked to stay with the then-MP in his Canberra home. The gay Sunshine Coast man said he was not surprised by the invitation as others before him had been asked the same question. Scroll down for video . James Ashby - the man at the centre of the Peter Slipper scandal - has spoken for the first time about his claims against the former speaker . The 35-year-old accepted the offer but within two days he became 'uncomfortable' with staying there after Mr Slipper allegedly asked his employee to massage his sore neck. 'He was in pair of boxers, he laid down on his bed - stomach down - and I stood beside the bed and massaged just his neck,' Mr Ashby told 60 Minutes reporter Liz Hayes. 'It was during that time he started with a moan that could only be described as sexual. 'And I felt uncomfortable and just said: ""You're done"", and I walked out of the room.' But the next day it escalated with Mr Ashby claiming the former speaker questioned why he showered with the door closed. He said Mr Slipper called him a 'prude' for not admitting the practice was abnormal. Mr Ashby said his employer 'made a point' of showering with the door open the next day after this exchange. Mr Ashby claims he was invited to stay with Mr Slipper when he took a job as an adviser in 2010 . Mr Ashby claims he became uncomfortable when Mr Slipper made 'sexual' moans when the former staffer gave him a neck massage . During his time as Mr Slipper's advisor, Mr Ashby allegedly continued to be harassed by the former speaker, including through text messages. Once Mr Slipper wrote: 'If u [sic] interested we could be closer?' But Mr Ashby replied with: 'I think we're good already'. Despite the reception he received from his adviser, Mr Slipper kept pressing him - at one point texting: U want something more? U brilliant at massages'. This is when Mr Slipper dropped his friendliness and started excluding Mr Ashby from work functions and asked to be contacted through his parliamentary adviser, Tim Knapp. But Mr Ashby claims the harassment continued, with Mr Slipper one day asking personal questions about his sex life that left him shocked, saying: 'We were lucky we didn't run off the road.' Mr Slipper has always denied the allegations and the case against him was initially thrown out by the Federal Court but it was then re-instated. Earlier this year, Mr Ashby announced he would dropping the allegations against Mr Slipper as he did not want to cause the 64-year-old any more mental health issues. Despite continued denials from all members of the LNP - including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Mr Ashby also alleged during the interview that he had sought advice from Queensland MP Wyatt Roy and Education Minister Christopher Pyne. He claims he had conversations with both politicians about his sexual harassment case. Mr Slipper has since been found guilty of misusing Commonwealth funds to visit Canberra wineries . During the interview, Mr Ashby also broke down in tears when he recalled an incident where he contemplated suicide . Mr Ashby said during his conversation with Christopher Pyne, the senior Liberal figure had offered to pay for a lawyer and promised him a job could always be found for him. But when the time came for Mr Ashby to leave he said he was told by Mr Pyne that if he ever revealed to anyone they had spoken he would label the former staffer a 'pathological liar'. These alleged offers made by Mr Pyne were then withdrawn, Mr Ashby said. In a statement, Mr Pyne moved to distance himself from the matter, claiming he nor any other member of the government are in no way involved. 'All these matters have been aired over and over again for the last three years,' Mr Pyne said. 'Mr Slipper has been found guilty of fraud against the taxpayer.' 'Mr Ashby settled a sexual harassment case with the Commonwealth. 'I had no specific knowledge of the allegations made by Mr Ashby and the first I knew that he was suing Mr Slipper was when I read it in the newspapers. 'This is a dispute between two individuals - not a dispute that includes me or any other member of the government.' Mr Roy was contacted by 60 Minutes but the program said he declined to comment on the matter. Despite constant denials from the Liberal Party, Mr Ashby claimed he had spoken with both Christopher Pyne (left) and Wyatt Roy (right) about his sexual harassment case . Mr Ashby also sought out counsel from Mal Brough - the MP who now occupies the Queensland seat Mr Slipper once held . Mr Ashby also claims the woman - known as Jackie - who helped him organise a lawyer in his case against Mr Slipper was in fact Queensland MP and  the former speaker's Liberal Party colleague Mal Brough. In a text message exchange with his colleague Karen Doane, Mr Ashby refers to Jackie who would be able to find them new jobs as he was in a position of power. 'I’d received a phone message...it said ""contact Jackie"" and I rung the number...a woman answered the phone and I said ""Oh hi, is Jackie there?"" and she said ""I'll put him on"",' Mr Ashby told 60 Minutes. 'Before I knew it, Mal Brough picked up the phone.' But Mr Brough has denied the allegations. 'I'm Jackie? That explains why no one ever knew who Jackie was,' he said. 'The only lawyer I organised was David [Russell QC] who met him once.' Mr Ashby - who is now a graphic designer on the Sunshine Coast - said he also contemplated suicide after the sexual harassment claims came to light. He was on the verge of tears as he recalled an incident where he had lined himself up to collide with a truck while he driving to Yeppoon - a coastal town in Queensland. 'Couldn't do it. I couldn't do it to Mum,' Mr Ashby said.","Peter Slipper, 64, hired James Ashby, 35, as one of his advisers in 2010 .

"By . Louise Eccles for Daily Mail . A dramatic drop in lending by Britain’s ‘risk-adverse’ banks since the economic crisis has boosted business for controversial payday loan firms, experts claim. New figures show that loans issued by five major UK banks plummeted by £365billion in the past five years. A survey by accountants KPMG revealed that lending had fallen by 14 per cent, from £2.7trillion to £2.3trillion since 2009, leaving a gap in the market for ‘shadow marketing initiatives’. The survey compared lending in the second half of 2009 to the first half of 2014 at Standard Chartered, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays (above), HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group . It warned that, in an effort to clean up their act after the financial crisis, banks may have gone too far in restricting lending and had forgotten that banking always included an element of risk. It means some consumers have been pushed towards high-interest payday loans in a bid to raise funds. The survey compared lending in the second half of 2009 to the first half of 2014 at Standard Chartered, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group. Richard McCarthy, UK head of banking at KPMG, said: ‘We have to remember that banking requires risk-taking. Yet in the rush to clean up the past, both banks and regulators have lost sight of this. A survey by accountants KPMG (visited by London mayor Boris Johnson, above) revealed that lending had fallen by 14 per cent, from £2.7trillion to £2.3trillion since 2009 . ‘The reduction in lending to customers since 2009 is testament to this risk-aversion. People need to borrow and they will look at other ways to do that if they cannot borrow through their bank.’ Citizens Advice urged banks to issue small, short-term loans at low interest – so that people did not turn to payday loan firms. Chief executive Gillian Guy, said: ‘Ultimately, people need more choice. There is a role for high-street banks to play by offering responsible, short-term micro-loans.’ China will overtake the United States to become the world’s biggest economy in just ten years, according to a report. The US has been the world’s economic leader for more than a century, but a huge rise in consumer spending in China is expected to see it passed in 2024. Chinese consumer spending is predicted to triple over the next decade, according to an IHS report – increasing from £2.14trillion to £6.4trillion. Earlier this month, the charity StepChange said the number of people struggling with payday loans had risen by 42 per cent in the past year, as customers tried to keep up with sky-high interest rates. The drop in lending reported by KPMG includes £309billion of consumer and business loans and a £56billion reduction in loans to other banks. The fall points to the continued struggle to get banks to lend to small and medium-sized businesses, a vital part of Britain’s economy. John Longworth, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said yesterday: ‘The banks have always been risk-adverse about lending to small and medium-sized businesses but, since the recession, they have been extraordinarily so.’ Four years ago, the Daily Mail launched its Make the Banks Lend campaign to highlight the plight of small firms that could not get the money they needed to grow.","Survey by accountants KPMG showed lending fell by 14% from £2.7trn to £2.3trn since 2009 .

After being freed, the survivors said that they feared they were 20 minutes from death and were drifting in and out of consciousness. Members of the group, aged between  one and 72, were treated in local hospitals following the incident and survived the ordeal. They are in the process of claiming asylum in the UK after travelling to Europe in a lorry before reportedly spending 18 hours in the cargo container en route to the UK.

"By . Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent, for The Daily Mail . Minister could step in to block a proposed 10 per cent pay rise for MPs that would take their salaries to £74,000 a year, George Osborne indicated yesterday. The Chancellor made clear his opposition to the move at a time when increases to public-sector workers’ earnings are capped at 1 per cent. He said the proposal by the Parliamentary pay watchdog was ‘not the final verdict’ and ministers would ‘tackle the issue’ after the general election. Pictured speaking on BBC1’s Andrew Marr show yesterday, George Osborne reiterated that he did not believe the MP's pay rise should be implemented . The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) has recommended that MPs should get an extra £7,000 on top of their £67,000 salary. However, in return MPs would have to make larger pension contributions and lose lucrative ‘golden goodbye’ payments when they leave office. Ipsa – which was set up to monitor MPs’ spending after the expenses scandal in 2009 – has defended the plans on the grounds that, overall, there would be no increased cost to the taxpayer. But John O’Connell, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Hiking politicians’ wages at a time when the national debt is still rising would be totally inappropriate. ‘In insisting on a pay rise, Ipsa is demonstrating itself once again to be totally unfit for purpose. This overgrown monster of a quango needs to understand that the public don’t want the cost of Government to go up any further.’ Polling commissioned by Ipsa found that two in three people thought the proposed salary of £74,000 was too high. The main party leaders have all made their opposition to the rise clear, but many backbench MPs appear to back the change. Speaking on BBC1’s Andrew Marr show, Mr Osborne reiterated that he did not believe it should be implemented. He added: ‘I don’t think it’s acceptable at a time when there’s continuing pay restraint in the public sector that MPs would receive such a big increase. But this is not the final verdict, this is not the final report. There will be a report after the election, and that’s when we’re going to have to tackle this issue.’ The plans were confirmed by new Ipsa chief executive Marcial Boo in his first interview, in which he claimed MPs should not be paid a ‘miserly amount’. He said: ‘All the evidence points towards MPs’ salaries having fallen behind.’ The failure to pay ‘fair’ rates would make it harder to recruit good candidates for Parliament, he told the Sunday Telegraph, adding: ‘This is an important job, the job of an MP. They are there to represent us all, to form laws, to send young people to war. ‘It is not an easy thing to do. We want to have good people doing the job and they need to be paid fairly. Now, that’s not paid in excess but it’s not being paid a miserly amount either. ‘There are lots of professionals in public life and in the private sector who earn a lot more than that – so it is not an excessive amount of money at all.’ MPs are already due a 1 per cent increase to £67,731 next April and unless ministers step in it will go up again a month later to £74,000. Mr Boo insisted a change in the law would be needed to prevent Ipsa following through with its proposals. Dave Prentis, secretary-general of the Unison union, said the announcement of the proposed pay rise left him furious, adding: ‘Very few things make me angry but I have got to admit the anger I felt when I heard that.’ He said the NHS pay-review body was pressured to recommend just 1 per cent, in line with pay-restraint policy, but ministers refused to pay even that, adding: ‘Now we find there are moves to pay MPs far in excess of anything Government service workers may expect to receive.’","Chancellor made clear his opposition of a 10 per cent pay rise for MPs .

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . The United States has started carrying out air strikes close to an Iraqi dam to stop Islamic State militants from capturing it. A US. defence official today confirmed the country's air force had commenced strikes around Haditha Dam in western Iraq, targeting insurgents there for the first time. While Anbar province, where the dam is located, remains in control of the Iraqis, the US offensive was an effort to beat back militants who have been trying to take over key dams across the country, including the Haditha complex. Scroll down for video . Air strikes: Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby confirmed today that the country's air force had commenced air strikes targeting Islamic State militants around Haditha Dam in western Iraq . Location: The US offensive was an effort to beat back militants who have been trying to take over key dams across the country, including the Haditha complex . Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said the dam is a major source of water and electrical power, and that the air strikes were made at the request of the Iraqi government. 'We conducted these strikes to prevent terrorists from further threatening the security of the dam, which remains under control of Iraqi Security Forces, with support from Sunni tribes,' he said. Last month Islamic State fighters were battling to capture the Haditha Dam, which has six power generators located alongside Iraq's second-largest reservoir. However, despite their attacks, Iraqi forces there backed up by local Sunni tribes have been able to hold them off. Strategy: Islamic State fighters were able to take control of the Mosul Dam (pictured) in northern Iraq last month, but persistent U.S. airstrikes later dislodged the militants . Attack: Islamic State militants have been trying to take over key dams across the country, including the Haditha complex (file photo) The group was able to take control of the Mosul Dam in northern Iraq last month, but persistent U.S. airstrikes later dislodged the militants. And while fighters have been trying to take it back, the U.S. has continued to use strikes to keep them at bay. 'We will continue to conduct operations as needed in support of the Iraqi Security Forces and the Sunni tribes, working with those forces securing Haditha Dam,' said Rear Admiral Kirby, who has been travelling with US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel for talks in Georgia, following the two-day NATO summit in Wales. US officials have expressed concerns that militants could flood Baghdad and other large swaths of the country if they control the dams. It also would give the group control over electricity, which they could use to strengthen their control over residents. Earlier this year, the group gained control of the Fallujah Dam on the Euphrates River and the militants used it as a weapon, opening it to flood downriver when government forces moved in on the city.

Water is a precious commodity in Iraq, a largely desert country of 32.5 million people. The decline of water levels in the Euphrates over recent years has led to electricity shortages in towns south of Baghdad, where steam-powered generators depend entirely on water levels. On Friday and Saturday, the U.S. used a mix of attack aircraft, fighter jets and drones to conduct two airstrikes around Irbil. The strikes hit trucks and armored vehicles. Those operations brought the total number of airstrikes to 133 since early August. The airstrikes are aimed at protecting U.S. personnel and facilities, as well protecting critical infrastructure and aiding refugees fleeing the militants.","US officials confirm strikes around Haditha Dam in western Iraq .

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . A house in London thought to be one of the smallest in Britain is up for sale, but it will set buyers back more than a quarter of a million pounds. The pint-sized property is made up of just 188 sq ft of living space but still crams in a kitchen, living area, bathroom and bedroom. Described by estate agents as 'unique', the cosy home boasts just one room and its front door is underneath the bed. Scroll down for video . A 188 sq ft house in an exclusive part of north London is up for sale for more than a quarter of a million pounds . The pint-sized, one-roomed property, in Barnsbury, Islington, will set its future buyer back £275,000 . The bedroom, suspended above the front door, is just 7ft 7ins x 5ft 8ins in size but does have storage space . The house's buyers will be forced to walk across the kitchen worktop before balancing on narrow steps, to make it to the 7ft 7ins x 5ft 8ins airborne 'bedroom'. The raised living area, complete with cushions and a small table, also has a small amount of storage space. The house is on the highly-sought after Richmond Avenue, one street away from Tony Blair's former house on Richmond Crescent. Blair sold that house for £615,000 in 1997 but it is now worth more than £3million. The future owners will brush shoulders with Hi-de-Hi! actress Su Pollard, who lives on Richmond Avenue. Despite being barely the size of a lock-up garage, the home, in Barnsbury, North London, will set buyers back £275,000 - more than £1,450 a square foot. Research by MailOnline earlier this year showed that in some parts of London, house prices rose by almost five times the average wage. The average house price in Westminster rose by an astonishing £160,810 to £976,822 in a year, while workers took home a median salary of £34,092. The housing bubble has forced many Londoners into renting, but in turn this has pushed up rent and demand for flats across the capital. Some landlords have split their family homes into tiny 'semi studios', meaning they can make more money but leaving tenants in cramped accommodation. Platinum Property Partners, a buy-to-let mortgage lender, said recently that landlords could make up to £38,000 in annual rental income by splitting a family home into flats, compared to around £18,000 if they did not. The raised living area, complete with cushions and a small table, also has a small amount of storage space . The bathroom is the only separate room in the house, but is barely large enough to fit a lavatory and a shower . The house's buyers will be forced to walk across the kitchen worktop before climbing steps to make it to bed . Winkworths, the estate agent selling the house, described it as 'unique' and added that they had already had a number of calls about it. He said: 'It's possibly the smallest house in the world. It's just been developed and put on the market. 'I think it will probably sell to an investor who'll let it as a short-let. It's a great crash pad for the area. It's got everything a house would have and the space is cleverly used. 'There's storage under the raised part of the living area, a patio out the front and a window. I've been to the property and it's a really sweet house - it works.' The house is on the highly-sought after Richmond Avenue, the home of Su Pollard and just one street away from Tony Blair's former house on Richmond Crescent . At least it has a front garden: Winkworths, the estate agent selling the house, say they have already had a number of calls about the property . The house, pictured centre left, looks more like a garage seen next to larger two and three-storey neighbours . While house prices and rent in London continue to soar, for just £5,000 more than the price of this property a buyer could purchase a two-bed house in the Lake District. A converted hotel, situated just a few miles from Windermere, Cumbria, has an open-plan kitchen, patio and its own parking space and costs £280,000. For the same price a buyer could pick up a three-bed detached family home in Penryn, Cornwall. One such house, with an asking price of £275,000, has a large double bedroom with an en suite bathroom, two bedrooms for children and a large back garden.

The bright two-bed house has an open-plan kitchen, patio, family-sized living room and its own parking space . Guinness World Records currently recognise a house in Conwy, north Wales, as Britain's smallest house. The house, aptly called The Smallest House in Great Britain, is just 10ft tall and has two rooms. It can only fit four people at a time and it around 6ft wide, but thousands of tourists still pay the £1 (50p for children) fee to enter the cramped, red house every year. It was occupied for about 200 years until local fisherman Robert Jones, who was 6ft 3ins tall, moved out in 1900. Local tour guide Anne Fletcher, 58, dons traditional Welsh dress to give visitors an authentic experience, and explained why the pint-sized home is a mecca for mini-home spotters the world over. She said: 'Thousands of people come to the Smallest House in Great Britain each year.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Chicago's close-knit acting community suffered a double blow this weekend as two of its stars were killed in tragic accidents over two days. Bernie Yvon, a 50-year-old actor who has starred in dozens of musicals in Chicago and its suburbs including the 'Music Man' and 'Mary Poppins', died on Saturday in a car crash. He was en route to Theatre af the Center in Munster, Indiana, where he was rehearsing a musical, 'Women On The Verge of a Nervous Breakdown', which was scheduled to open next week.

Glynn, a veteran of the Chicago theater and actress appearing in notable television dramas, died Saturday after being struck by a tree while bicycling a forest preserve trail . 'We are are all in shock and denial,' William Pullinsi, the veteran . artistic director of the theater, told the Chicago Tribune. 'We did all . kinds of shows together. He had so many friends in the business.' Molly Glynn, 46, also a veteran of Chicago theater who also appeared in notable television dramas, died on Saturday a day after being struck by a tree while bicycling a forest preserve trail. A memorial trust fund that was set up in her name has already raised $79,000 from 1,106 donations, just shy of the $85,000 goal, according to GiveForward. The deaths of Glynn and Yvon was especially 'overwhelming'  because the actors were in the prime of their stage careers and well respected by their peers, according to Chris Jones, the Chicago Tribune's chief theater critic.

The events prompted much mourning in rehearsal rooms across the city and backstage in playhouses, he wrote. Technical rehearsals for 'King Lear' at Chicago Shakespeare Theater stopped, while the actor Lance Baker posted on Facebook: 'Grief has become near-catatonia'. 'Glynn was known for her intellect, good looks, honesty and feisty personality. Yvon, a classic, twinkle-eyed song-and-dance-man in the old tradition, was known for his charm, warmth, bonhomie and formidable chops on a stage,' Jones wrote. 'Their deaths cast a pall Saturday everywhere from the Goodman Theatre downtown to the Marriott Theatre in suburban Lincolnshire. Taken together, these two esteemed actors had worked almost everywhere.' Police arrived on scene on Friday to find Glynn horribly injured by the falling tree. She was pronounced dead the next day . Police officers arriving at the scene of Yvon's accident said they found a white 2007 freightliner semi-tractor trailer sitting on top of the actor's gray Toyota four-door vehicle, according to NBC. He was pronounced dead at the scene. An investigation is ongoing but preliminary information suggests Yvon was attempting to make a left-hand turn when the semi struck his car. 'This is a tremendous loss of a fantastic performer and treasured colleague,' said Richard Friedman, general manager of Theatre at the Center, Richard Friedman, NBC reported . 'Bernie made everyone he met feel better about life and every audience member who saw Bernie's work was fortunate to be entertained by a masterful artist.' Yvon had some Broadway credits, such as starring as Harry Houdini in a production of 'Ragtime', but most of his work was performed around Chicago. He played Lumiere in 'Beauty and the Beast', the pharaoh in 'Joseph' and the genie in 'Aladdin', among many other roles, according to the Marriott Theatre's bio on Yvon. “Bernie Yvon was a triple threat – an immensely talented singer, dancer, and actor – who solidly delivered in any production that I ever cast him in through the years,' Pullinsi said. 'Audiences just loved him. He was always upbeat, positive and kind and the Chicagoland theater community is in deep mourning of a great man.' Glynn, seen here with husband Joe Foust, regularly appeared in prestigious Chicago theater productions and gained national attention with television credits on shows like 'Boss' and 'Chicago Fire' Glynn died after getting caught in a storm along with her husband and fellow actor Joe Foust. The tempest's winds were so powerful that they uprooted a tree and sent it crashing into Glynn's path, according to the Chicago Tribune. 'She's gone,' Foust wrote on Facebook early Saturday, according to NBC Chicago. 'I couldn't save her.' Besides . recognition across the Chicago theater community for her regular . appearances on prestigious stages such as Steppenwolf, Writers, Next, .

"By . James Slack for the Daily Mail . The Independent Press Standards Organisation, whose chairman is Sir Alan Moses (pictured), will oversee editorial standards for the majority of national and regional newspapers and magazines . IPSO, the new Press regulator, begins work today with a commitment to be 'rigorous, independent, fair and transparent'. The Independent Press Standards Organisation, whose chairman is the retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Alan Moses, will oversee editorial standards for the majority of national and regional newspapers and magazines, including the Daily Mail. It has far tougher rules than the previous regulator, the Press Complaints Commission. The watchdog will have the power to impose fines of up to £1million for serious and systemic wrongdoing and can require editors to publish up-front corrections. IPSO will also include a standards and compliance arm, with investigative powers to call editors to account. It will require all newspapers to have their own effective complaints-handling procedures. Yesterday, Sir Alan said: 'IPSO aims to help rebuild public trust in the Press through independent, fair and transparent regulation. Its role as an independent regulator is to provide support and redress for victims of Press abuse. To raise standards is to protect the public from abuse. 'The board and I believe that the freedom of the Press can best be maintained by supporting and enhancing standards through an independent regulator. 'To achieve that aim we are committed to establishing and demonstrating our independence. Where standards have been breached we will apply sanctions and seek redress. Where we see patterns of poor behaviour we will pursue change. 'Democracy depends on a free but fair Press. Through independent regulation IPSO will make an important contribution to that vital objective.' IPSO said subscribing publications will be expected to deal fairly and swiftly with complaints from readers. It will also monitor the complaints handling procedures of its subscribing publications with expectations of clarity, efficiency, fairness and transparency. A majority of the 12 members of IPSO's complaints committee, expected to be confirmed today, will be from outside the industry. They are expected to include the former broadcaster and campaigner against miscarriages of justice David Jessel, Jill May of the Competition Commission, and Lara Fielden, vice-chairman of the London Probation Trust. Among the industry members are expected to be Elisabeth Ribbans, former managing editor of the Guardian, and Peter Wright, Editor Emeritus of Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail.

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . Nothing brings home the youthfulness . of England’s squad more than a quick check of their first World Cup . memories: Raheem Sterling’s are from South Africa 2010. ‘The . first World Cup I fully remember was the last one, when Steve [Gerrard] . scored in the first game against the United States,’ said 19-year-old . Sterling. ‘I was . sitting at home eating pizza with friends during the game and then we . went out for a little kick-about at half-time to try to imitate these . boys.’ Dreamland: Raheem Sterling (right) in training with England team-mate Rickie Lambert ahead of the World Cup . Fully focused: Sterling is looking forward to playing in the World Cup at the age of just 19 . Sterling gestures towards to Gerrard, who is sting alongside him as part of the World Cup squad. Four years ago he was a 15-year-old youth playing football on St Raphael’s Estate in the shadow of Wembley, though for most of his early life the stadium was a building site. Only in his teens did the new stadium emerge and by then Sterling was on QPR’s books before joining Liverpool at 16. But no one epitomises the youthful potential of this England squad more than Sterling. He is not the youngest — that honour falls to Luke Shaw — but in terms of a young man most likely to make an impression on the world, Sterling is the prime candidate. As pressure intensified in Liverpool’s title run-in, Sterling looked nerveless, becoming a key player in the title challenge, despite having being marginal at the start of the season. He fairly forced his way into the team with his pace, finishing and skill impossible to ignore. Just ask Arsenal’s back four. Stars in his eyes: Sterling (right) training with England's talismanic forward Wayne Rooney . ‘It was an enjoyable team to play in,’ said Sterling. ‘And the fans as well, the way they got behind us in the . last few games was brilliant. I’ve never seen anything like it. I got . real goose bumps.’ England have had their fair share of youthful . prodigies, from the  over-exposed Theo Walcott, who joined the squad at . 17 in 2006, to Michael Owen, a raw 18-year-old who lit up the World Cup . in 1998. Wayne Rooney also burst on to the world scene at 18, but that . was at the European Championship in 2004. Sterling approaches this . World Cup with expectations of his experience being more akin to Owen’s . than Walcott’s, who didn’t play. If anyone is likely to shock opponents, . it is Sterling. ‘Now I’m just working hard, so anything can happen, . but I’m not going to say I’m going to do amazing things,’ he said. ‘I . will give 100 per cent and hopefully what I try will come off and work. But I’m not going to put myself under pressure and say I’m going to do . what Michael Owen did. I’m just going to work hard for the team.’ Even . the most confident young prodigy can shrink a little when promoted to . the England squad. ‘It’s a bit nerve-racking, sitting there eating . dinner with your new England team-mates. You don’t want to be too much . in someone else’s zone. But I’ve had a lot of help and advice from the . Liverpool lads.’ Though he was born in Maverley, Jamaica, he came to . London when he five. His initial emergence saw him given an England cap . at 17, becoming the third youngest after Walcott and Rooney since 1881. Yet the limelight faded as Brendan Rodgers demoted him from the first . team. Topping it off nicely: Steven Gerrard celebrates scoring against the USA in 2010, a goal the 15-year-old Sterling watched on TV while eating pizza . His life off the pitch was also under scrutiny, a . well-established rumour asserting that he had fathered a number of . children. In reality he has only one daughter, one-year-old Melody, . although he is no longer with her mother. In football terms, it . looked as though he might have shone brightly but faded quickly. Rodgers’ restraint paid off in the second half of last season, . Sterling’s renaissance bringing him back into the national . consciousness. Not only was he key to Liverpool’s rise, but he was also . considered mature enough to play centrally behind the strikers as well . as wide right or left. ‘It was a new position for me and I had to . adapt. I think Brendan mainly put me there to move the ball quicker. Sometimes I like to stay on the ball a bit too long and I think he put . me in there so someone might smash me or something like that! He put me . in there to make sure I play with two touches. I played there when I was . younger at QPR, just behind the striker, and I quite like it.’ Tactically, . he has proved himself adept and Rodgers felt he had grown up enough to . describe him as the best young player in Europe. ‘Obviously that’s nice . to hear,’ said Sterling. ‘But I try to block it out. For a manager like . Brendan to say that is obviously good for me, but I just try to keep . level-headed.’ He says it is his mother, Nadine, who keeps him . grounded and in the next breath reveals he has moved out to his own . place. Like most teenagers, he doubtless feels ready to take on the . world.","Sterling watched Gerrard score vs USA on TV, aged 15 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Almost half of white boys from poorer homes are leaving primary school unable to read a book, according to a new literacy campaign. They are among about 130,000 UK children who leave each year with a sub-standard reading level, a study from Read On. Get On found. Researchers said a quarter of 11-year-olds in the poorest families had fewer than ten books in  their homes. Almost half of white boys from poorer homes are leaving primary school unable to read a book, according to a new literacy campaign. Picture posed by models . Worryingly, the most commonly read material by children was text messages, although ebooks were growing in popularity. Overall, 40 per cent of children from poorer backgrounds leave primary school not reading as well as they should – among boys this figure rises to 45 per cent. Boys are twice as likely as girls to fall below even a very basic reading level – one of the biggest differences on this measure in the developed world. Between the strongest and weakest readers, the gap is roughly equivalent to seven years’ schooling. In the EU only Romania has a wider gap in this area. Experts behind the report claim around 1.5 million children are in danger of being left behind by 2025 unless things improve. Authors including JK Rowling and Michael Morpurgo plus a host of book publishers and the CBI are among those backing the campaign, which is spearheaded by charity Save the Children. One aim is to get the major political parties to commit to improving the reading of the most disadvantaged in their manifestos for next year’s general election. The research found low-income, white British boys were particularly likely to fall behind, with 45 per cent unable to read well by the age of 11. Reading well is defined as being able to read and understand books, websites, newspapers and magazines. Overall, 40 per cent of children from poorer backgrounds leave primary school not reading as well as they should - among boys this figure rises to 45 per cent. Picture posed by model . Researchers found youngsters  who were already behind in reading when they left primary school continued to struggle through their secondary education. The report also found England has the strongest link between illiteracy and unemployment of any developed country. The UK’s gross domestic product could be 2.1 per cent higher by 2025 – a staggering £32billion in monetary terms – if all children read well by age 11, it claims. Poor literacy is linked to unemployment, low pay and even crime. Around one in four people earning less than £10,000 is not functionally literate – compared with fewer than one in 25 for those earning over £30,000. At the same time, MPs on the Commons Business Select Committee also warned that an ‘alarmingly high’ proportion of adults do not have a good grasp of reading, writing and maths, and urgent action is needed to tackle the issue. The committee said those who struggled the most with literacy and numeracy were not getting the help they need. The committee argued that while the Government has pledged free training and tuition for any adult who wants to study English and maths up to GCSE, those with the most limited skills in these core areas were not aware that this support is available. Committee chairman Adrian Bailey said: ‘Problems with reading, writing and maths have a huge impact on people’s daily lives, including getting and keeping a job, understanding bills, forms and documents, and guiding children through education. ‘It can affect adults in many walks of life, but it also undermines the economic performance of our country.’","130,000 UK children who leave each year with a sub-standard reading level .

"By . Kieran Gill . Follow @@kie1410 . Roberto Martinez thinks Gerard Deulofeu can break into the Barcelona first team, but the Everton manager admits the forward may find it tricky competing against the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar, Pedro and Alexis Sanchez for a place. Deulofeu, a regular in the Everton team, thrust himself on to the radar of Barcelona coach Luis Enrique after helping Martinez's side finish fifth, leading him to recall the 20-year-old to the Nou Camp. But Martinez feels another year in the Premier League would have benefited Deulofeu more, rather than returning to the La Liga giants, where he will be constantly competing for a place. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gerard Deulofeu freestyling at Barcelona's Nou Camp . Youngster: Gerard Deulofeu was recalled by Barcelona but may struggle to hold down a first-team place . Control: Deulofeu held down a regular place in the Everton side, helping them finish fifth in the Premier League . 2011-2013: Barcelona B (68 Apps, 27 Goals) 2011-NOW: Barcelona (2 Apps, 0 Goals) 2013-2014: Everton (loan) (25 Apps, 3 Goals) 2014-NOW: Spain (1 App, 0 Goals) It will, undoubtedly, prove a difficult task, given Barcelona's prowess in attack. Nevertheless, it is a challenge Martinez feels Deulofeu is up to. 'He is ready to play for Barcelona because he has special talent, certain qualities that make him stand out,' Martinez said in an interview with Spanish national daily sport newspaper Mundo Deportivo. 'I was delighted when Del Bosque called him up for the friendly before the World Cup. 'They had followed him for the year he was at Everton and were able to see that he was performing to a very high level. 'It would have been good for Gerard and for Everton if he had stayed for us for another year. He would have enjoyed a bigger role in the team than I think he will have at Barcelona because of the competition he will find there. Passion: Deulofeu is ready to battle with Lionel Messi, Neymar, Pedro and Alexis Sanchez for a place . Boss: Roberto Martinez says Deulofeu has a 'special talent' but wished he could have kept him for another year . 'It would have been fantastic to have him at Everton for another year, and another year in the Premier League would have made him better prepared to make the jump up to Barcelona, but they didn't want that, and I presume that's because Luis Enrique, who knows him well, knows how good he is.' Martinez, unfortunately, looks to be without another of his loan stars next season, as striker Romelu Lukaku returns to parent club Chelsea after scoring 15 goals with Everton. It is believed, however, the Belgium international could follow Deulofeu to Spain with Atletico Madrid among those chasing the striker, should the La Liga champions lose Diego Costa to Chelsea. 'Romelu is a bit like Gerard, a great player but a youngster, he arrived in Liverpool without much tactical discipline, but he has improved a lot, without losing any of his physical or technical assets,' said Martinez. 'If he ends up going to Atletico, knowing the work of (Atletico coach) Diego Simeone, it will be good for Simeone and for Atletico. I also think his characteristics will suit Simeone, and vice-versa.' On his way? Romelu Lukaku is thought to be on the wish-list of Atletico Madrid, should they lose Diego Costa .","Roberto Martinez says Gerard Deulofeu is 'ready to play for Barcelona because he has special talent'

"By . Mark Duell . Updated: . 17:18 EST, 12 January 2012 . A nine-year-old girl whose tragic battle with Huntington's disease captured the nation’s sympathy after she was taunted about her suffering on Facebook by a neighbour died last night. Kathleen Edward, of Wyandotte, Michigan, is expected to be buried at a memorial garden in nearby town Livonia next to her late mother Laura Edward, 24, who also died of the brain disorder, in 2009. The girl hit the headlines 15 months ago when Jennifer Petkov, a neighbour of her grandmother Rebecca Rose, posted nasty images on Facebook that made fun of both Kathleen and Mrs Edward. Dead: Kathleen Edward, 9, pictured, of Wyandotte, Michigan, is expected to be buried at a memorial garden in nearby town Livonia next to her late mother Laura Edward, 24, who died of the same brain disorder in 2009 . Well-known: The girl hit the headlines 15 months ago when Jennifer Petkov, a neighbour of her grandmother Rebecca Rose, posted nasty images on her Facebook page that made fun of both Kathleen and her mother . ‘She suffered with this disease for a while and she never complained,’ Ms Rose told the Detroit Free Press. ‘She was also happy, always smiling. I didn’t want her to suffer anymore.’ Michigan Memorial Funeral Home in Flat Rock is organising the funeral and Kathleen, who died at 10pm on Wednesday, will be buried next to her late mother at Mount Hope Memorial Gardens. Mrs Petkov, a former neighbour of Ms Rose in Trenton, became a figure of hatred after admitting to have taunted the girl. One Facebook posting was of the girl's photo placed over a set of crossbones. Another included a photo of Mrs Edward in the arms of the grim reaper. Global backers who heard about the terrible abuse in October 2010 raised money to send Kathleen on a toy shopping spree. A feud between Mrs Petkov and Ms Rose reportedly started in 2008 after a simple disagreement over an unanswered text message when the grandmother was holding a birthday party at her home. Feud: Jennifer Petkov, left, was a former neighbour of the girl's grandmother Rebecca Rose, right, in Trenton . Ms Rose has been inundated with messages of condolence on Facebook following Kathleen's death. ‘I can’t tell everybody how much I appreciate all of the kind words,’ she told the Detroit Free Press. 'She suffered with this disease for a while and she never complained. She was also happy, always smiling' Rebecca Rose, Kathleen's grandmother . Kathleen is survived by her father Robert, stepmother and her two sisters - Ashley, 6, and Madison, 2. Huntington's disease also claimed the life of her grandfather, reported Fox affiliate WJBK. Mrs Petkov apologised for what she did but faced charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and reckless driving after allegedly trying to run over another neighbour with her car, reported WKBK. She was sentenced to 18 months of probation for assault and battery, reported Trenton Patch. Awful experience: Mrs Rose, pictured left with her granddaughter Kathleen, right, has been inundated with messages of condolence on Facebook from well-wishers . Tragic: Kathleen is survived by her father Robert, stepmother and her two sisters - Ashley, 6, and Madison, 2. Huntington's disease also claimed the life of her grandfather . Ms Rose told Trenton Patch last June that she was being subjected to a fresh wave of online abuse against her own daughter - Kathleen’s aunt - who was being called a ‘retard’ outside her home. 'I can’t tell everybody how much I appreciate all of the kind words' Rebecca Rose . Mrs Petkov became known as the 'Devil of Detroit Street' and was forced to move home last February after her and her husband Scott attracted international condemnation for what happened. Last June Ms Rose gave police documents showing more nasty posts allegedly made by the Petkovs. One said: 'Detroit St. Party, When that kid dies, cause boys and girls it’s to happen (sic).' Another post said: 'Dead and gone, only a few more hours till party time, I’m going to visit a grave and take a p***.' One post came a day before the anniversary of the death of Mrs Edward. Nasty: Mrs Petkov, a former neighbour of Ms Rose in Trenton, became a figure of hatred after admitting to have taunted the girl. One Facebook posting was of her photo placed above a set of crossbones . Obscene: Another posting included a photo of her mother Laura Edward in the arms of the grim reaper . Police said Ms Rose was 'crying and extremely upset' by those messages in June. She served Personal Protection Orders against the Petkov couple, so they could not communicate with her. 'Detroit St. Party, When that kid dies, cause boys and girls it’s to happen' Jennifer Petkov, neighbour . The huge feud is thought to have begun over an unanswered text message relating to a party. Ms Rose is understood to have received a text message when she was holding a bouncy castle birthday party from Mrs Petkov, who asked if her children could come over. But because she did not respond to the text message fast enough, the feud is said to have begun. When Mrs Edward died in 2009 the Petkov couple allegedly drove a pick-up truck up and down the street, adorned with a coffin and carrying the slogan 'Death Machine'.","Kathleen Edward, of Wyandotte, Michigan, will be buried next to mother .

"By . Candace Sutton for Daily Mail Australia . The charge of murder against Gold Coast man Gable Tostee has been described as 'weak' and 'difficult' because the 28-year-old was not on the balcony when Warriena Wright plunged to her death from his Surfers Paradise apartment last month, a judge has said. Considering Tostee's bail application in the Brisbane Supreme Court, Judge Debra Mullins asked Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden, 'The prosecution case is that the applicant wasn't on the balcony that Ms Wright fell from?'. 'That appears to be the most likely scenario,' Ms Farnden said. Tostee has been in custody since mid-August when he was arrested and charged with murder. Scroll down for video . New Zealand citizen Warriena Tagpuno Wright was on a two week holiday in Australia when she plunged 14 storeys to her death, after organising to meet with Gold Coast man Gable Tostee through dating app 'Tinder' Police documents allege that an audio recording from Tostee's phone reveal the sounds of a struggle, during which someone is choked and taunted. Tostee has been charged with Ms Wright's murder. Police documents have been filed in the Supreme Court ahead of Tostee's bail application on Monday . 'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' Justice Mullins told the accused's barrister, Anthony Kimmins. 'But in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.' Justice Mullins postponed the bail application, requesting more information after she read sworn statements by police, Tostee and Tostee's parents about his autism diagnosis. Emergency crews at the scene of Ms Wright's death at the foot of the highrise Avalon apartments in Surfer's Paradise in Queensland, where Tostee resided. She said his previous diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum was referenced in the Crown's material, but was not addressed in defence documents. She said a diagnosis of autism on Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his apartment on the night of August 8, when Ms Wright fell 14 storeys to the pavement below. 'It just struck me that it may not be an irrelevant matter,' Justice Mullins told Mr Kimmins. Mr Kimmins replied that he wasn't sure when Tostee last visited a specialist, and sought more time to find out. Tostee's high-rise apartment is investigated by detectives. The secret recordings ultimately led the police to arrest Tostee on August 15. Police have opposed bail for Tostee, saying he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Warriena Wright. Police say Tostee would immediately go back on Tinder if released and contact young women and, given his 'propensity of violence' would pose an 'unacceptable risk' to the community. A document filed in the bail application in the  says an examination of Tostee's mobile phone 'has identified that he has been in contact with over 250 female persons using the Tinder application since March 2014'. 'Police hold a strong belief that if Tostee is granted bail, he will recommence his using social media,' a document filed in the court said. 'Police believe Tostee's blatant disregard for human life and his propensity of violence displayed in this instance would place the safety of the community at an unacceptable risk.' Documents filed to the Supreme Court claim the Gold Coast man charged with murdering his New Zealand Tinder date told the young woman 'you're lucky I haven't thrown you off the balcony' before she plunged 14 storeys to her death. An audio tape made on accused murderer Gable Tostee's phone inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on Queensland's Gold Coast, there is a choking sound, the 28-year-old taunting Ms Wright as she gasps for air, a door sliding open and her screaming, 'no, no no' and 'just let me go home' before he says, 'I would but you have been a bad girl' - and 26 seconds later the sound of a fading scream. The documents, filed in the Supreme Court ahead of Gable Tostee's bail application hearing, alleged a recording on Mr Tostee's phone captured three hours and 19 minutes of audio from the night that Warriena Tagpuno Wright died. Ms Wright was a 26-year-old, visiting Australia for a two week trip to attend the wedding of friends . Tostee maintains his innocence and will fight the charge, after he was arrested on August 15 for Ms Wright's death on August 8. The document claims the recording started at around 1am. Tostee, 28, has been charged with the murder of Ms Wright, 26, who suffered a fatal fall from the Surfers Paradise balcony in Queensland on August 8. Police say they decided to arrest Tostee on August 15 after finding the recordings. The documents assert that an fight erupted at around 2.13am. A male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, according to the police document. Police claim a male accuses the woman of 'beating him up.' The male voice is also reportedly heard saying, 'I will do what you want, I will be your sex slave.' A struggle is heard, during which a male voice allegedly says: 'This is f***ing b***s***, you are lucky I haven't chucked you off my balcony you goddamn little psycho b****'. The woman tells him, 'no, no, no'. The man allegedly replies: 'I would, but you have been a bad girl.' A phone call is then reportedly made to a lawyer. Police claim that CCTV captures Tostee leaving the building. It is alleged that the Gold Coast man then ordered pizza within an hour of Ms Wright's death. Neighbours earlier reported hearing an altercation and the sound of a woman screaming at around 2:30am. Ms Wright and Tostee contacted each other through dating app Tinder and met in Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise, before returning to Tostee's apartment. Ms Wright lived in New Zealand's Lower Hutt region and was in Australia for a two-week holiday to attend a wedding. Tostee maintains his innocence and says he will fight the charge.

"By . John Mcgarry . Hibernian have been granted permission by Everton to speak with Alan Stubbs about the vacant manager’s job at Easter Road. The former Celtic defender has been identified by chief executive Leeann Dempster as the ideal candidate to rebuild the club. It’s understood talks will take place between both parties in the coming days before a decision is made on whether to offer the ambitious 42-year-old the post. Credentials: Stubbs has worked under David Moyes and Roberto Martinez during his time at Goodison . Stubbs, currently Everton reserve-team manager, is well versed in Scottish football from his five years at Celtic between 1996 and 2001, and has made it clear that he covets a front-line managerial job. He was interviewed for the Everton manager’s job following Davie Moyes’ departure a year ago but chairman Bill Kenwright opted for Wigan boss Roberto Martinez. Stubbs, who enjoyed two spells with his Merseyside boyhood heroes as a player, is well regarded within Goodison but he feels the time is now right to strike out on his own. Mark Venus, who was Tony Mowbray’s No2 at Easter Road, remains the favourite for the position. Friends in high places: Stubbs counts Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney amongst his football contacts . Dumbarton manager and former Hibs skipper Ian Murray has also been linked but it’s understood Hibs haven’t yet approached the Sons about speaking with him. Motherwell boss Stuart McCall, who Dempster worked well with at Fir Park, has also been mentioned but it’s believed he’s unwilling to entertain leaving the Premiership for the Championship at this stage.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 12:49 EST, 15 July 2011 . Mexican soldiers discovered the largest marijuana plantation in the country's history, hidden under black cloth in the middle of the desert. The 300-acre plantation is four times larger than the previous record discovery by authorities and workers had even installed toilet facilities, the Defence Department said. The towering pot plants sheltered under black screen-cloth in a huge square on the floor of the Baja California desert, more than 150 miles south of Tijuana, across the border from San Diego. Hidden: This desert plantation looks innocent enough but underneath the black tarpaulin was the largest marijuana farm in Mexico's history . A house and facilities sit uncovered at one end of the massive plantation . Army general Alfonso Duarte said the screening, which is often used by regular farmers to protect crops from too much sun or heat, made it difficult to smell what was growing underneath. It was only when soldiers on the ground reached the isolated area on Tuesday that they found thousands of pot plants as high as 2.5 meter tall. More than 40,000 people have died in drug violence in Mexico since late 2006. Over 9,300 people have been gunned down in Ciudad Juarez alone since early 2008 when the rival Juarez and Sinaloa cartels began an all-out war for rich trafficking routes. That conflict has unleashed further violence as local gangs battle over street corner drug rackets, and turn to kidnapping and extortion. The Mexican military and federal police sent to curb the mayhem are also blamed by many residents for killings and other abuses. The average height of the plants was about 1.5 yards (meters). 'We estimate that in this area, approximately 60 people were working. When they saw the military personnel, they fled,' Gen Duarte told reporters. A few were later reportedly detained at a nearby roadblock, but he added no arrests were made at the scene. He said traffickers could have . harvested about 120 tons of marijuana from the plantation, worth about . 1.8 billion pesos or about $160 million. The discovery comes as drug related violence in Mexico's troubled border states has taken a dramatic upswing over the last few months. Last Friday At least 17 people were killed in a bar massacre night in the northern Mexico city of Monterrey when riflemen opened fire on bystanders and staff. Consequence: A Mexican army soldier takes a photo of a dead man after a gun battle between army soldiers and gunmen in the northern city of Monterrey . Busted: Federal Police agents present Jesus Enrique Aguilar, alias 'El Mamito'. Police believe Aguilar is connected with the killing of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent . Soldiers walk through the biggest marijuana plantation found in Mexico in San Quintin . And on Monday 10 decapitated bodies were found in the northern Mexican city of Torreon. The bodies were dumped in the back of a truck with their heads scattered across the city. Authorities said the killers left a message directed at another gang. The cartels have also become more brazen in the face of ongoing efforts by the Mexican army to curb their operations. Yesterday, two separate raids by Mexican government special forces left nine gunmen dead. Raids on a Monterrey weapons training ground left four dead, while five more were killed after an SUV carrying members of another cartel opened fire on troops in the town of Cadereyta. Monterrey, a major industrial hub, . has seen a spike of violence since the Gulf and Zeta cartels began . fighting for control of drug traffic there two years ago. On Thursday Mexican journalist Armando Rodriguez, renowned for his coverage of gangland slayings in his hometown of Ciudad Juarez, lay dead in a casket, shot by suspected cartel hitmen. As his colleague Jorge Luis Aguirre drove to the funeral home in the dismal border city to pay his last respects, his cell phone rang. The husky voice delivered a chilling warning: 'You're next.' Mexican soldiers discovered the plantation in a remote desert surrounded by cactuses, . Soldiers discovered toilets on the plantation . Soldiers stand guard at the biggest marijuana plantation found in Mexico . 'I left Ciudad Juarez in panic the same day,' said Aguirre, the former editor of news website La Polaka. The newsman joined a growing number . of Mexicans fleeing raging drug cartel violence in and around Ciudad . Juarez to begin a long-shot bid for political asylum next door in the . United States. Video of the plantation showed a . sophisticated system of piped-in irrigation to support the plants, which . Gen Duarte said was fed by two wells. The plantation also included some wooden outbuildings, presumably for use by people caring for the plants. Troops will destroy the fields by burning them, Duarte said. While it's unknown how much of Mexican drug cartels' income comes from marijuana, recent discoveries suggest it remains a large-scale trade. Guarded: the plantation is now under heavy protection in case any of the cartel return . The house and facilities at the far right are dwarfed by the size of the crop . Last October, Mexican authorities made their largest-ever seizure of marijuana packaged for sale, a record 148 tons (134 metric tons) found in a number of tractor trailers and houses in Tijuana. They appeared to make up a major distribution center traced directly to Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, Mexico's most-wanted fugitive, who has expanded the reach of his Sinaloa cartel along the U.S.-Mexico border since escaping from prison in 2001. In November, U.S. and Mexican investigators found two long, sophisticated tunnels under the border between Baja California and California, along with more than 40 tons of marijuana in and around the tunnels. An army helicopter casts a shadow over parts of the biggest marijuana plantation . The tunnels ran about 2,000 feet from Mexico to San Diego and were equipped with lighting, ventilation and a rail system for drugs to be carried on a small cart. The biggest ever plantation in Mexico prior to this week's discovery was in northern Chihuahua state in 1984. U.S. officials say they believe the tunnels also were the work of the Sinaloa cartel. While the Arellano Felix or Tijuana cartel long dominated the drug trade in Baja California, the cartel has been greatly weakened by government hits on its leadership, and authorities say there are signs that the Sinaloa cartel now also operates in the area. Duarte said he did not know which group operated the plantation found Tuesday.","Discovery comes as Mexico drug violence takes upswing .

"Stevenage FC said teenager was on books and played for academy team . By . Stian Alexander for MailOnline . A teenager who was on the books of League Two football club Stevenage FC drowned after falling into a filthy hotel swimming pool while on holiday in the Cypriot party town of Ayia Napa. Savvakis Alexandros Georgiou was on holiday visiting family on the sun-kissed island when he went back to the Kalypso Hotel on August 17. The 18-year-old, from Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, had been partying with pals through the night but is believed to have slipped and fallen into the pool as the party continued at the hotel in the early hours of August 18. A spokesman for Stevenage FC today confirmed that the teenager was on its books and played for one of its academy teams. Tragic: Savvakis Alexandros Georgiou, pictured with girlfriend Mercedes Cole, drowned in Ayia Napa . Despite there being more than 20 people in the swimming pool, nobody spotted that he was in trouble until a female swimmer tripped over his body at the bottom of the pool. It is believed he was under water for between five and 20 minutes and that nobody spotted him because the pool covered in algae and littered with rubbish, including syringes, condoms and cigarette butts. Several people tried to revive the teen, but he was pronounced dead at Famagusta Hospital with a post-mortem confirming that he had drowned. The teen had travelled to Ayia Napa with his cousin on August 17 after visiting his grandparents for four days in nearby Protaras, just five miles away. The teen had initially booked into the Fedra hotel on August 14, but was told there had been a booking mistake and he was told he would have to stay in its sister hotel, The Kalypso. Speaking this week, the teen's aunt Angela Soteriou, 39, said an independent forensic coroner had said the swimming pool was 'murky and littered with rubbish'. Horrific: It is believed Savvakis was under water for between five and 20 minutes and that nobody spotted him because the pool covered in algae and littered with rubbish . She said: 'The water was filthy. No one could see him because no one could see the bottom of the pool. We believe that had the pool been clean he may have been seen earlier.' She added: 'It is just so devastating. It's a tragedy. He was an athletic, bright and intelligent boy. 'He was an inspiration and so full of life and mischief. He was just so special, so loving. He had a good heart. If you asked him anything at all he would do it for you. He shouldn't be gone, he should be here. He had his whole life ahead of him. It's a tragic, tragic loss.' A statement put out from his family warning of unregulated hotels, states: 'On behalf of Savvakis Alexandros Georgiou, parents Elbida and George Georgiou. 'I would like to make everyone (mothers fathers brothers sisters etc) aware of the tragic death of their 18 year old son, Savvakis Alexandros Georgiou, who lost his life on Monday 18th August 2014 between the hours of 7:00-8:00am leaving behind his brothers Andronico and Stefano. 'Savvakis lost consciousness after slipping into the algae ridden swimming pool which was filled with syringes, condoms and cigarette butts. 'This resulted in his body not being visible for approximately 20 minutes, which inevitably led to him drowning. Clear visibility perhaps could have saved his life. 'The original booking was made at the Fedra hotel apartments. Upon arrival they were informed that the hotel was fully booked and were referred to Kalypso, which are operating without the legally required licenses. 'As per local TV news, Kalypso, having submitted their applications since 2013, had not as yet received approval from the Cyprus Tourism Organisation to operate the hotel. 'Neither had they received approval from the local council to open the swimming pool to the public. 'On the one hand the hotel continues to welcome unsuspecting holiday makers, into their illegally operating premises. On the other hand, none of the responsible authorities have taken any further measures in closing them down.' The 194-room hotel, which cost as little as £15-a-night and has four swimming pools - one indoor and three outdoor - is slated for being 'dirty and scary' with the swimming pools said to be 'murky and filthy', on Trip Advisor . An investigation has been launched into the death and the owners of the hotel, a father and son aged 63 and 33, were arrested on suspicion of not holding the proper hotel and pool permits. They have been released without charge as the investigation continues. The girlfriend of Savvakis  - known as Sav - said she would do anything to have her boyfriend back in her arms again. Pictured is one of the three outdoor pools at the hotel, which is rated as one of the worst in the whole island of Cyprus, according to Trip Advisor . Mercedes Cole wrote on a tribute site to the teen after his body was flown back to the UK for his wake and funeral. She wrote: 'All I am able to say is I had the world's best boyfriend and would do absolutely anything to be back in his arms MY beautiful angel.' After visiting his body on Monday, she wrote: 'I can't explain how beautiful my angel looks sleeping. 'Seeing him today was the most unforgettable day of my life. 'I was just waiting for him to squeeze my hand back, open his eyes and look into mine or respond to my 'I love you'. He looked as peaceful as ever, just as if he was sleeping next to me! 'I can't wait to see you one day my beautiful person. I'll love you forever and always.' The teen had travelled to Ayia Napa with his cousin on August 17 after visiting his grandparents for four days in nearby Protaras, just five miles away . The 18-year-old's funeral will take place on Wednesday September 3 at the The Greek Orthodox Church of St John the Baptist in Hornsey, north London, and he will be buried at Southgate Cemetery. School pal Mikey Michael paid tribute to his pal, writing: 'What can be said about Sav that we don't already know. 'He was a cheeky chappy with a heart of gold. His sense of humour and personality will always be remembered. 'Sav, you will be missed. May your family and loved ones have the strength during this difficult time. Your memory will live in us forever. Rest in peace.| . Another friend, Jordan Bell wrote: 'Sav...I don't know where to start, bro. 'I know for a fact that for me and the boys, the news hasn't really sunk in yet, we've all cried but not really accepted it. 'Some days are worse than others and it's hard for everyone to be positive. 'You know I'm not religious but I'm starting to think as a group we are all blessed to have the support of each other and indeed, blessed to have had you for a short while. 'Just make sure you sleep well mate because once the rest of us arrive up there, there will be no time to rest. 'Goodnight, bro, god bless x.' Friend Anna Elizabeth Michael wrote: 'Anyone who knew and loved Sav knows his love of Chelsea. 'It's my idea that anyone who wants to acknowledges this on Wednesday in the smallest way, be it a badge, a scarf or even earrings in the blue and white colours of Chelsea Football Club. 'I'll be painting my nails. I just feel like it's something he'd appreciate and another way of letting him know wherever he is how much we love him x.' The hotel is one of the worst in the whole island of Cyprus, according to Trip Advisor. It comes in 100th place out of 104 hotels reviewed, with 55 out of 87 guests giving it the lowest possible 'terrible' ranking on Trip Advisor. The 194-room hotel, which cost as little as £15-a-night and has four swimming pools - one indoor and three outdoor - is slated for being 'dirty and scary' with the swimming pools said to be 'murky and filthy'.

'A curfew has been imposed in three riot-hit areas of Muzaffarnagar,' said the head of the state's home ministry, R.M. Srivastava. 'The situation is still very tense, but under control' Clashes:  The bodies of some of the 19 victims of the weekend's riots are lined up at the district hospital at Muzaffarnagar after the weekend's violent riots . Injuries: A teenage boy and a young girl have been caught up in the riots and are receiving treatment in hospital . Police said the attack on the Hindu attendees of the meeting appeared well planned, as the assailants were armed . The weekend's violence escalated after an attack on thousands of Hindu farmers who had met to demand justice for the three men . Violence broke out Saturday afternoon after thousands of Hindu farmers held a meeting in Kawal village to demand justice in the August 27 killing of three men who had spoken out when a woman was being verbally harassed. The state's minority welfare minister, Mohammad Azam Khan, said attendees had been giving speeches calling for Muslims to be killed in response to the death of the three villagers. The farmers were set upon as they were returning home after the meeting, senior police official Arun Kumar said, adding that the assailants appeared to have planned their attack as they were armed with 'rifles and sharp-edged weapons.' Gunfire was reported from several areas of the village. Within hours clashes broke out in neighboring villages, Kumar said. Lock down: The government sent in military police to enforce a curfew in the entire state of Uttar Pradesh, home to 200million . Indian broadcast journalist Rajesh Verma of news channel IBN 7 was shot in the chest while covering a communal demonstration in Abupura, and died at the scene. Uttar Pradesh was at the heart of some of India's worst communal clashes in December 1992, after a Hindu mob razed the 16th-century Babri mosque in Ayodhya. The government has warned that India is seeing a rise in communal violence, with 451 incidents reported already this year, compared with 410 for all of 2012. In August alone, communal violence killed two and injured 22 in a village in Bihar state, east of Uttar Pradesh, according to Indian media. Outbreaks have also been reported recently in Uttar Pradesh's district of Shamli, as well as in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir.","Violent riots in northern India kills 26 people on Sunday .

"By . Richard Shears . A North Korean military officer has been executed with a mortar shell blast for disrespecting late 'Dear Leader' Kim Jong-il by drinking alcohol during the 100-day mourning period. South Korean media claim Kim Chol, the secretive state’s former vice minister of the army, was forced to stand on a spot that had been targeted with a mortar on the orders of Kim Jong-un. The North Korean leader, who took over from his father after his death in December last year, demanded Kim Chol was 'obliterated', with 'no trace of him behind, down to his hair' in January. No fun: Throughout the mourning for Kim Jong-il, pictured with his youngest son and new North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, all pleasurable activities, including drinking, were banned . tears for 'Dear Leader': Women mourning during the state funeral procession of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, who died on 17th December 2011 . It followed the North Korean regime's decision to order its 25 million population to abstain from pleasurable activities – . including drinking alcohol - in honour of Kim Jong-il. As an initial crack down on pleasure, anyone found to be not showing extreme distress in the hours after the dictator’s death were dealt with severely by being sent to six months in labour camps, according to reports leaking from the Stalinist nation. It was claimed that anyone who failed to turn up at organised mourning events within two days of the burial service were sent to a labour camp and punishment was also meted out to anyone who even made a mobile phone call out of the country. But when the mourning period to mark Kim’s burial was over and the strict ‘no pleasure’ 100 days followed, anyone who raised a glass of alcohol was in danger of receiving a death sentence. According to South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper, Kim Chol was one of those who failed to resist the chance of having a drink. Funeral procession: The mourning period after the death of Kim Jong-il lasted 100 days . Cry, or else: North Koreans cry and scream as they lament the loss of Kim Jong-il -  those who did not follow the strict rules of mourning were severely punished . And while he was the most senior official reported to have been arrested and executed, the South Korea newspaper reporter that a number of other generals were shot after being found guilty of drinking and being involved in sex scandals. In total, 14 senior party, government and military officials were said to have been ‘purged’ on the direct orders of Kim’s son and new leader Kim Jong-un. It was claimed by sources outside the country that the mourning periods had created a ‘vicious atmosphere of fear’ which have spilled over to daily life almost a year after Kim Jong-il’s death. South Korean lawmaker Yoon Sang-hyun told the Chosun Ilbo paper that the executions were probably not over. ‘It seems that the purges will continue for the time being, as Kim Jong-un is tightening his grip on power,’ he said.","Senior military official broke the rules of mourning Kim Jong-il .

The alleged rapist on the loose is described as about 6ft tall and 180 to 200lbs with a dark complexioned and dark hair that is short on the sides and longer on top. Investigators say the alleged victim underwent evaluation from the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner Unit and the evidence was sent to the state crime lab for processing. The results from the crime lab are not back yet. Gongbay, who is 6ft, 205lbs, comes from from Rockville, Maryland. He was recruited to UNM by former coach Mike Locksley in 2011. After leading the Lobos in rushing that season, Gongbay intended to follow Locksley to Maryland but his plans fell through so he asked the new coach, Bob Davie, if he could return to UNM. Davie said he was impressed by Gongbay's good academic standing and knew his teammates liked him so welcomed him back in August 2012. He has played effectively as a backup running back the past two seasons.

"It is a child's worst nightmare, living at school. But few would mind their parents relocating to this 37-acre former boarding school - complete with an open-air swimming pool, tennis courts, and a caving centre. On the market for £3 million, Howell's School in Denbigh, north Wales, has sparked a flurry of interest, with would-be buyers clamouring for the Grade II-listed structure. Grandeur: This is the Grade II-listed main building of Howell's Independent Girls' School, which has gone on the market for £3 million after going into liquidation . Extravagant: Would-be buyers of the 37-acre estate in Denbigh, north Wales, could have their breakfasts in this open-plan dining hall once used by boarders . Common room: There would be no need to clamour for sofa space on a Saturday night in this living room - one of many across the five buildings on the site . The independent girls' school, which opened in 1859, closed in September last year when the company that took over the building went into liquidation. H2000 was found to have almost £500,000 in debts in August 2013 - forcing the school to refund all deposits with just a month until the start of term. Though external tutors are currently using the facilities to teach language lessons, the entire grounds could soon be transformed into a home. Made up of five buildings, it includes three boarding houses and the former principal’s house along with the main block. It covers 37 acres of the tranquil Vale of Clwyd and facilities include an open-air . swimming pool, four tennis courts, squash courts, a climbing wall, a . caving centre and an equestrian centre. Historic: The oak-panelled hallways with spiralling staircases were built in 1859. The school acted as a haven for young ladies throughout both World Wars . Idyllic: Would-be buyers have rushed to register their interest in the sprawling estate which has four tennis courts, a swimming pool and even a caving centre . Dream playground: The vast plains of land set in the tranquil Vale of Clwyd have acted as a sports field for hundreds of pupils for more than a century . Making a school a home: The new owner will have the chance to change the purpose of the five buildings on the sprawling site from educational to private . Though it is currently registered for 'educational purposes', the new owner will have the chance to change it to 'private'. The school, whose Latin motto was 'Only God be honour and glory', was originally built in 1858 for 55 boarders and 50 day girls. It acted as a haven for hundreds of young ladies during both World Wars, where they escaped the atrocities and lived a sheltered life of sports games and creative arts. By 2013, boarders paid £7,000-a-year, and day girls paid £4,000-a-year. Former . pupils at the school include actress Nerys Hughes, best known for her . role in 70s sitcom The Liver Birds, and Steps singer Lisa Scott-Lee. Ace: Would-be buyers could host a mini tennis tournament in their back garden with this impressive set of courts set behind the historic turrets of the house . Quaint: Shrouded in a cluster of luscious trees, this comparatively small building with floor-to-ceiling windows was once home to Howell School's principal . Giddy up: Let's hope the new owner has plenty of hobbies or this state-of-the-art equestrian centre, with balconies to watch the action, will go to waste . Take a dip: This is the brick building that encloses the open-air swimming pool on a hill in the Vale of Clwyd, with a set of wooden climbing bars outside . It has been listed for sale by Jackson Stops and Staff who said the property is unlike any other. Crispin Harris, from the estate agent, said: 'It has only just been advertised but we are receiving a lot of interest.

"A law student has called on Facebook's one billion users worldwide to join a class action fight against the social network over privacy rights. Austrian campaigner Max Schrems is claiming damages of €500 (£397) per supporter for alleged data protection violations. He has billed it as a ‘David and Goliath lawsuit’ and it could ultimately be the largest class and privacy action ever taken in Europe. A law student has called on Facebook's one billion users worldwide to join his Europe versus Facebook (pictured) class action against the site over privacy. Austrian campaigner Max Schrems is claiming damages of €500 (£397) per supporter for alleged data protection violations, billed as a ‘David and Goliath lawsuit’ ‘We are only claiming a small amount, as our primary objective is to ensure correct data protection,’ Mr Schrems said. The lawsuit is being taken in the Commercial Court in Vienna against the Irish subsidiary of the New York-listed web giant. Therefore, it only applies to users who have a contract with Facebook Ireland. This means its not available to users in the US and Canada. Angered users can sign up using an app on fbclaim.com. The app asks users to sign in using their Facebook account to verify their identity. They will also need to upload a scan or image of their passport or driving licence. Supporters have been assured there are no cost risks and all the data is securely encrypted. ‘However, if many thousands of people participate we would reach an amount that will have a serious impact on Facebook.’ Angered users are being asked to sign up using an app on fbclaim.com. The lawsuit is being taken in the Commercial Court in Vienna against the Irish subsidiary of the New York-listed web giant. Mr Schrems is moving his Europe-V-Facebook.org campaign from complaints to the Data Protection Commission in Ireland, to the courts in his homeland, as European consumer law allows complainants to take legal action where they live. The privacy activist has more than 20 complaints of alleged data breaches involving Facebook filed with the Irish data watchdog already. The class action in Vienna claims Facebook Ireland is in breach of European law on users' data, and that it violates rights by tracking internet use on external sites including the use of ‘Like’ buttons. The lawsuit is being taken in the Commercial Court in Vienna against the Irish subsidiary of the New York-listed web giant. Therefore, it only applies to users who have a contract with Facebook Ireland and is not available to users in the US and Canada. Angered members can sign up using an app on fbclaim.com (pictured) It also attacks Facebook's analysis of users through what it calls ‘big data’ systems. Mr Schrems additionally criticised the company for allegedly supporting the US Prism surveillance programme - the National Security Agency's secret monitoring and data mining exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. An earlier landmark battle, launched in Ireland to find out what Facebook tells US spy chiefs, was referred to the European Court of Justice by a judge in Dublin last month. Facebook declined to comment. Mr Schrems said he is the only claimant under the Austrian legal system, but the action is being financed entirely by Roland ProzessFinanz AG. If successful, Roland will receive 20 per cent of the damages for putting up the funding. The class action is open to all registered adult Facebook users outside the US and Canada. Mr Schrems added: ‘We love to complain constantly about data protection problems in Europe, now it's also time for us to enforce our fundamental rights. ‘In the beginning we made great progress in Ireland. As a result of our complaints, Facebook had to delete data and deactivate its facial recognition all over the world.’","The lawsuit is being taken in the Commercial Court in Vienna against the Irish subsidiary of the web giant .

"Astronomers have calculated the origin of a meteor that injured 1,000 people after breaking up over central Russia. They used amateur video footage to plot the path of the  space rock that burned up over the city of Chelyabinsk causing shockwaves that blew out windows. The results suggest the meteor belongs . to a well known family of space rocks known as the Apollo asteroids, and probably came from an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Scroll down for video . The Chelyabinsk meteor (labelled ChM) appears to have been on elliptical orbit around the Sun before it collided with Earth. The orbits of Earth and Mars are shown, although the calculations included the rest of inner and outer planets. Dozens of videos of the fireball were . taken with camera phones, CCTV and car-dashboard cameras and put online, and the team found two in particular that helped then worked out exactly where it came from. Using this amateur video footage, they were able to plot the meteor's trajectory through Earth's atmosphere and then reconstruct its orbit around the Sun. 'Using evidence gathered by one camera at the Revolution Square in the city of Chelyabinsk . and other videos recorded by witnesses in the close city of Korkino, we . calculate the trajectory of the body in the atmosphere and use it to . reconstruct the orbit in space of the meteoroid previous to the violent . encounter with our planet,' said Jorge Zuluaga and Ignacio Ferrin, from the University of Antioquia in Medellin. Experts said the meteor that left a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, weighed around 100,000 tonnes  and measured 55 feet in diameter . 'We use it to classify the meteoroid . among the near Earth asteroid families ﬁnding that the parent body . belonged to the Apollo asteroids.' Using the footage and the location of an . impact into Lake Chebarkul, the team calculated the height, speed and . position of the rock as it fell to Earth. They estimate that it was travelling between 13km/s and 19km/s, brightening up above Korkin when it was between 32km and 47km high. Early estimates of the meteor's mass . put it at ten tonnes; US space agency Nasa later estimated it to be . between 7,000 and 10,000 tonnes. Nasa estimates the size of the object . was about 17m (55ft). The reconstruction uses three vantage points: the Revolution Square at Chelyabinsk (C), the Korkin metropolitan area (K) and Lake Chebarkul (L). The brightening point (BP) and the fragmentation point (FP) are the points of the trajectory seen from Chelyabinsk and measured using the shadow cast by the poles at the Revolutionary Square. 'In February 15 2013 a medium-sized meteoroid impacted the atmosphere in the region ofChelyabinsk, Russia,' the team wrote. 'After its entrance to the atmosphere and after travel by several hundred of kilometers the body exploded in a powerful event responsible for physical damages and injured people spread over a region enclosing several large cities. 'We present in this letter the results of a preliminary reconstruction of the orbit of the Chelyabinsk meteoroid.' Once they had discovered its trajectory, the researchers put their figures into astronomy software developed by the US Naval Observatory. The results suggest the meteor belongs to a well known family of space rocks known as Apollo. Of about 9,700 near-Earth asteroids discovered so far, about 5,200 are thought to be Apollos. The Apollo asteroids are a class of asteroids with Earth-crossing orbits. The first Apollo asteroid was discovered in 1918 by Max Wolf observing from Heidelberg, Germany . Friction: Burning from the friction with Earth's thin air, the space rock exploded 14.5 miles above the Russian town of Chelyabinsk . Asteroids are divided into different groups such as Apollo, Aten, or Amor, based on the type of orbit they have. Dr Stephen Lowry, from the University of Kent, said the team had done well to publish so quickly. 'It certainly looks like it was a member of the Apollo class of asteroids,' he told BBC News. 'Its elliptical, low inclination orbit, indicates a solar system origin, most likely from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. 'Perhaps with more data, we can determine roughly where in the asteroid belt it come from.'

"South Korea has fired shells into North Korean waters after their rivals sent more than 100 rounds below the disputed sea boundary during a live-fire drill. The heated artillery exchange was . prompted by an unusual warning fax sent from the North to the South, . informing them of their live-fire drill. Though . it is not unusual for the reclusive nation to practice at sea, South . Korean officials were alarmed by the alert, which they claim 'indicates . their hostile intention'. It comes just days after Kim Jong Un's reclusive nation threatened to launch a 'new form' of nuclear power tests - and coincidentally during the annual South Korea-US military practice, which North Korea dubs a rehearsal for invasion. Scroll down for video . Dispute: The South Korean military shot shells into North Korean waters during a drill after their rivals fired across the sea boundary during their own practice . Residents on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, metres south of the border, were told to seek shelter during the drill. There were no reports of injuries . The heated exchange took place during the US Marines' annual military training with South Korea, which the North brands rehearsal for invasion . According to South Korean military officials, the North fired more than 500 rounds during a three-hour drill - 100 of which crossed the border. The South fired back 300 rounds from its K-9 self-propelled howitzer batteries, and scrambled F-15 jets. Residents on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, located in the battle-stricken Yellow Sea, were evacuated to shelters during the exchange. The Northern Limit Line, a maritime border that wraps itself round a part of the North's coastline, has been the scene of frequent clashes. In 2010, two civilians and two marines on the island were killed by North Korean military during a border dispute. The North claimed it was provoked by South Korean military exercises. Earlier that year, 46 people died off the coast of nearby Baengnyeong island after a warship sank. South Korea claims it was gunned down by the North, which their rival neighbour denies. 'The fact that they have sent such a message to us indicates their hostile intention.' said Wi Yong-Seop, a spokesman for the South Korean Defence Ministry. 'The aim is to threaten us and rack up tension on the Yellow Sea border and the overall Korean Peninsula,' he said. South Korean military (pictured) was alarmed by an early-morning fax from the North warning them to control their vessels in the region as they would be 'training'. Though live-fire training is not uncommon, it is unusual for the rivals to warn one another. The South said it showed hostile intentions . Training: Amphibious assault vehicles of the South Korean Marine Corps were throwing smoke bombs in a drill with the US where they practised moving from sea to shore. But during the morning, more than 100 shells from the North crossed the border. The South responded by shooting back 300 rounds . The North calls the South Korea-US drills a rehearsal for invasion despite the allies claiming they are routine and defensive . Disputed border: Yeonpyeong Island has been subjected to numerous bloody naval skirmishes over the years as North and South Koreans train near the border . The message, faxed to South Korea's . Second Fleet headquarters at 8am local time, warned officials to control . their vessels in the tensely-guarded western sea as they would be . conducting live-fire drills later in the day, officials said. It stated that all action would be north of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), but did not specify what time it would take place. Seoul officials claim the move is an . expression of Pyongyang's frustration at failing to win outside aid in . recent weeks despite numerous attempts. And . since the UN published a report early this month accusing Kim Jong-Un . of war crimes akin to Nazi Germany, the reclusive nation has increased . threatening rhetoric and conducted a series of rocket and ballistic . missile launches. This weekend, tensions rapidly intensified. On Saturday, North Korea also accused the South of 'gangster-like' behaviour by 'abducting' one of its fishing boats and threatened to retaliate. The South said it had sent the boat back after it drifted into its waters. Hours later, Pyongyang threatened to . conduct a fourth nuclear test at some point. After the North's warning fax early this morning, South Korea responded that it would react strongly if provoked. North Korea blasted the response, with one military official Yun Jong Bum telling the North's official news agency: 'The boneheads appear to have completely forgotten the fact that Yeonpyeong island was smashed by our military's bolt of lightning a few years ago.' There were no specific targets during this morning's exchange, and no . shells from either side were fired at any land or military . installations, claimed an official with South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Northern Limit Line was drawn up at the end of the . 1950-53 Korean War - and North Korea does not recognise it. Five South Korean border islands were evacuated as the Yellow Sea became engulfed by smoke during the drills at noon local time . Last time the US trained with South Korea, the North sent near-daily threats, including warnings of nuclear strikes against Seoul and Washington . The Northern Limit Line was drawn up at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War - and North Korea does not recognise it . The two sides . are still technically at war as the conflict ended in a mere truce, not a . treaty. 'It's up to the two . militaries either to recognise or reject their own claimed line, and . challenge the other's - this goes back and forth, so this is probably . another episode of that,' said Daniel Pinkston of the International . Crisis Group. Earlier in . 2010, a South Korean naval vessel was sunk close to the line by what an . international commission said was a North Korean torpedo, although the . North denies involvement. Today, Kang . Myeong-sung, a resident speaking from a shelter on Yeonpyeong island, which is in . sight of North Korean territory, said that anxious islanders were . huddled together in shelters. Kang said he didn't see any fighter jets, . but he could hear the boom of artillery fire. It . is not the first time conflict has broken out during the South Korea-US . military drills, which the North calls a rehearsal for invasion. The . allies say they're routine and defensive. Last spring, tension spiked after a . near-daily barrage of North Korean threats, including warnings of . nuclear strikes against Seoul and Washington, following international . criticism of Pyongyang's third nuclear test in February of that year. Pyongyang routinely test-fires artillery and missiles into the ocean, but it's rare for the country to disclose such training plans in advance . On Sunday, Pyongyang threatened to conduct a fourth nuclear test at some point, though Seoul says there are no signs of an imminent detonation . But the North has gradually dialed . down its threats and sought to improve ties with South Korea in what . foreign analysts say is an attempt to lure international investment and . aid. There has been no . major breakthrough in the North's reported push to win outside aid, . however, with Washington and Seoul calling on the North to first take . disarmament steps to prove its sincerity about improving ties, analysts . say. The North Korean live-fire drills and the country's hints at a nuclear test are meant to express anger and frustration over what the North sees as little improvement in progress in its ties with South Korea and the US, said Lim Eul Chul, a North Korea expert at South Korea's Kyungnam University. Lim said the North might conduct a fourth nuclear test and launch other provocations to try to wrest the outside concessions it wants. The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 American troops are deployed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea.","North Korea conducted live-fire drill at 12.15 (3.15am GMT), firing into disputed waters near a South Korean island .

"A Mexican budget airline has apologised to passengers who watched sticky tape placed over a hole in a jetliner's engine come off mid-flight. Holidaymakers aboard the VivaAerobus Flight 1100 en-route from Tampico to Monterey, Mexico, were aghast when they saw the makeshift engine repair. Their horror only deepened when the tape apparently couldn't stand the pressure of the flight, peeling off and leaving a gaping hole. Scary: Sticky tape flaps in the breeze as VivaAerobus Flight 1100 flies from Tampico to Monterey, Mexico . Botch job? A picture taken from inside the cabin shows the makeshift repair that had been made to the engine . VivaAerobus has insisted the plane was not in danger at any point during the incident, which was videoed by one of the passengers and posted online. Garcia Honandes, an aviation specialist, said: 'The plane had lost a lid covering in one of the engine mounts. 'It seems workers decided to place the adhesive tape on it as a temporary repair measure.' According to the airline the adhesive tape did not affect the airworthiness of the plane. 'The high-speed tape, which is not an adhesive tape or duct tape as some passengers said in social networks, is a tape designed and certified to do this kind of temporary repairs', said the airline. The airline also said that although the tape came off during the flight, 'it did not compromise at any moment the safety of the airplane, which can fly without the lid.' The airline said it understands that passengers became alarmed during the flight and 'deeply regrets' the situation. Gaping hole: This picture taken after the jet landed shows how big the hole was in the plane's engine . Hair-raising: The plane made is safely to Tampico, and the airline insisted that it was never in any danger . Gabriela Etienne Ortega was one of the passengers aboard the flight and confirmed that the adhesive tape was real. 'I am going to tape your heart like a turbine in VivaAerobus, with adhesive tape', said one Twitter user. 'If you have never traveled with VivaAerobus now you're eveb less likely to, scary!' tweeted another. Customers faced delays of up to three hours after a Warsaw-bound plane and an aircraft from Frankfurt Hahn that had just landed collided in the parking area of Stansted at about 6.45am. VivaAerobus said the wing tip of one plane and the tail cone of another ‘made contact’, while Essex Police revealed routine breath tests on both pilots returned zero readings and no one was hurt.","Airline VivaAerobus insists that the jet was never in any danger .

"'Social situation': Romanian prime minister Emil Boc resigned today and ended his government after weeks of protests against austerity measures . The Romanian prime minister today announced his immediate resignation at that of his government, claiming he wanted to protect the stability of the country. Emil Boc said he was resigning 'to ease the social situation' after weeks of mass protests in Romania over austerity measures he introduced in 2010. Opposition politicians have now called for early parliamentary elections, which are currently scheduled for November. President Traian Basescu named justice minister Catalin Predoiu to replace Mr Block as interim head of a government whose popularity is languishing in opinion polls. The Romanian parliament has 60 days and two attempts to approve a new government. If it fails, the parliament is dissolved and new elections will be called. However the ruling coalition and its partners have enough votes to elect a new government. Mr Boc, who became prime minister in 2008, urged Romania's feuding politicians to be mature and rapidly vote for a new government. Anger: A protester waves the Romanian national flag after Mr Boc announced his resignation earlier today . Protests: A string of old shoes are tied to a tree and post as thousands of people called on Mr Boc to step down after deeply unpopular austerity reforms . He defended his record, saying that he had taken 'difficult decisions thinking about the future of Romania, not because I wanted to, but because I had to.' He added that the International Monetary Fund has forecast growth of up to two per cent in Romania this year - lower than expected, but higher than the EU average. Mr Basescu will hold talks with the political parties later today about the formation of a new government. Temporary charge: Minister of justice Catalin Predoiu will take control until elections are held . Crin Antonescu, who heads the opposition Liberal Party, said: 'This is a victory for those that demonstrated on the streets.' He said 'the most corrupt, incompetent and lying government' since the 1989 anti-communist revolt had gone. Victor Ponta, leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party, said he would ask for early elections. Romania signed up for a €20billion loan with the IMF, the EU and the World Bank in 2009 to help pay salaries and pensions after the economy shrank by more than 7 per cent. In 2010, the government increased sales tax from 19 per cent to 24 per cent and cut public workers' salaries by a quarter to reduce the budget deficit. Last month, Romanians staged weeks of protests to express anger at cronyism and a perception that the government is not interested in the problems of ordinary people. They protested against low standards of living, widespread corruption and the passage of some laws without parliamentary debate. Reaction: Mr Boc increased sales tax and cut public sector salaries in 2010 as part of an IMF loan . Mr Boc added: 'I know that I made difficult decisions, but the fruits have begun to appear. 'The most important thing is the economic stability of the country. In times of crisis, the government is not in a popularity contest, but is saving the country.' Committed to adopting the euro under the terms of its accession to the EU in 2007, Romania is the eurozone's second poorest member and is still struggling with the economic legacy of communist state control.","Emil Boc steps down immediately as opposition MPs call for early elections .

"Wigan may send dual-code international Joel Tomkins to Workington for his re-introduction into rugby league once they have got him back into shape. Warriors coach Shaun Wane says the Super League champions have had to work on the 27-year-old second-row forward's body after he spent the last three years playing among the three-quarters in rugby union with Saracens. Although Tomkins was playing as a . makeshift centre when he made the switch of codes, Wane plans to use him . mostly in the pack, the position in which he made his England rugby . league debut. Return to rugby league: Wigan-born Joel Tomkins jumped at the chance to return to his roots, especially under his old mentor Shaun Wane . Tomkins, who has rejoined his hometown club on a four-and-a-half-year deal, is still at least four weeks away from making his eagerly-awaited return to the 13-man code after undergoing treatment for a back injury. He has also been put through a rigorous fitness regime by Wigan's head conditioner Mark Bitcon since being unveiled a fortnight ago and will be now re-introduced to the wrestling techniques used in training by most Super League clubs these days. 'He's got bigger already,' Wane said. 'He looks a real athlete now, working in the short period under Mark. 'He didn't look like the Joel Tomkins who left when he came back in, which is unbelievable. But he's getting there now. He looks fantastic now. He seemed huge within a week.' Return to action: Centre Darrell Goulding, left, will be back after sitting out last Friday's 16-12 derby defeat by St Helens . Wigan have been badly hit by injuries in recent weeks but Wane is determined to allow Tomkins to make a gradual return, possibly with partnership Championship club Workington, who have had the use of fringe Wigan players all year. 'I'm not going to rush him or pressure him in any way,' Wane said. 'I've told him that because I know what he'll be like, he'll be itching to play. He won't play before he's ready, even if we've got lots of injuries. 'He might go to Workington to get some match-fitness. He's not wrestled since he went to Saracens so he needs to get into the grind.' Wigan will receive some relief for Saturday's trip to bottom club London Broncos, with forwards Eddy Pettybourne and Tony Clubb set to make their return from lengthy injury lay-offs, and Wane is also considering giving a debut to former Leigh second-rower Sam Hopkins. Pettybourne, who was signed from Wests Tigers in the winter, has not played since damaging a calf at St Helens on Good Friday while former London captain Clubb has missed the last two months with a knee injury. Centre Darrell Goulding, whose move to Hull KR next season was confirmed on Tuesday, will also be back after sitting out last Friday's 16-12 derby defeat by St Helens.","Wane may send Tomkins to Workington for re-introduction into rugby league .

"The reaction of older fans to Ronald Koeman’s appointment as Southampton manager may well be: 'Do I not like that'. But it doesn’t mean they are casting dispersions about the 51-year-old Dutchman’s suitability to take over from Mauricio Pochettino on the south coast. For all Koeman’s considerable achievements in the game, he is best-known to a generation of supporters for being at the centre of an infamous fly-on-the-wall TV documentary about Graham Taylor’s reign as England manager. Signing on: Ronald Koeman (centre) will take over from Mauricio Pochettino as Southampton manager . Dutch delight: Ronald Koeman scores against England to deny them a place at the 1994 World Cup . Escape: Koeman escaped the foul with a yellow card and England got a free-kick outside the area . Helpless: Nothing went right for manager Graham Taylor that infamous night in Rotterdam in 1993 . The Impossible Job, which spawned a thousand catchphrases, Koeman escapes a red card for a bad foul on David Platt and later scores the goal which knocked England out of playing in the 1994 World Cup. As Koeman and his team-mates celebrate, a downtrodden Taylor tells the fourth official: ‘Tell your pal, he’s just cost me my job”. Of course, Koeman’s career is about far more than that one Holland-England game but it’ll certainly come up whenever Southampton get a dodgy decision next season. Koeman is one of many great Dutch players who have lit up the game since 1974. The difference between him and the likes of Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten and Dennis Bergkamp is that he was a defender. Nominally, he was a defender anyway. He played at the back but was best-known for his ability on the ball and his devastating free-kicks. Bullet finish: Ronald Koeman scores for Barcelona in the European cup final in 1992 against Sampdoria . Pure joy: Koeman scored the only goal in the 1992 European Cup final for Barcelona against Sampdoria . The most famous one came for Barcelona against Sampdoria at Wembley in 1992 that gave Barca their first-ever European Cup. His goal tally of 193 is probably a world-record for a defender. Koeman the player would walk into a Dutch all-time XI. In a 17-year playing career with Groningen, Ajax, PSV, Barcelona and Feyenoord he won nine league titles and two European Cups – the first with Guus Hiddink’s PSV in 1987. As someone who worked under Cruyff at Barcelona, his instincts to play the right way will please Saints fans who loved the football under Pochettino and will be desperate to keep at least some of their bright young players like Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana at the club. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who played for Koeman at Ajax, said when he was with the Amsterdam club that Koeman’s talent as a player gave him an advantage over other managers. Giving youth a chance: Koeman helped develop Dutch internationls Stefan De Vrij and Bruno Martins (below) Talent spotter: Koeman helped develop Indi (right) Prolific: John Guidetti (centre) scored 20 goals for Feyenoord under Koeman in 2012 . ‘He was terrific. We’d be taking free-kicks and after a while he’d step in and blast some home,’ said the striker. 'Talk about respect, he’d only been with us two days and he had it from the lads. You could see he got on really well with them.’ But it’s one thing believing in the right thing and another being successful over the long term in the Premier League, as Koeman’s one-time Barca team-mate Michael Laudrup found at Swansea City last season. So far, Koeman’s managerial career has not quite matched the stardust of his playing days though he can be proud that Holland’s defence in this World Cup is dominated by Feyenoord players he helped develop. High point: Ronald Koeman led Feyenoord to two second-place finishes in the Dutch league . Talking tactics: Koeman gets his message across to his Benfica playes during training at Old Trafford in 2005 . After starting out as Hiddink’s assistant with Holland at the 1998 World Cup and then performing the same role at Barcelona, Koeman became a  manager in his own right with Vitesse Arnhem in 2000. He served Ajax, Benfica, PSV and AZ Alkmaar over the next decade with mixed effects. But his time in Rotterdam – scene of his famous foul on Platt – with Feyenoord was Koeman at his best, triumphing against the odds in a manner that clearly impressed the Southampton board. Once-great Feyenoord were in ruins when Koeman took over in 2011. With no budget for transfers, they finished in the top three in each of his three seasons at the club – twice runners-up. Even more impressively, the club’s Academy was voted the best in Holland, better even than Ajax. Replacement: Koeman has taken over from Mauricio Pochettino who joined Tottenham in May . Top stuff: Southampton enjoyed an impressive Premier League campaign last season, finishing eighth . Further shades of Southampton came in the development of young players into the first-team. Jordy Clasie, Bruno Martins Indi, Stefan de Vrij, Terece Kongolo, Tonny Vilhena and Jean Paul Boëtius all went on to play for Holland having worked first under Koeman. Having worked with young Manchester City striker John Guidetti when he scored 20 goals on loan for Feyenoord, you can expect Koeman to try and link up with him again at St Mary’s. English football is obviously far more competitive than the Dutch Eredivisie. Instead of being a national hero like he was in Holland, Koeman is still regarded as a bogey-man by England fans over the age of 30. Without him, we may have gone to the 1994 World Cup in America and had a great time. But if he can help uncover a few more Luke Shaw’s at Southampton, their fans might decide they do rather like him after all. After what has seemed an interminable three weeks of speculation, Southampton seem to be on the verge of going Dutch with the appointment of Ronald Koeman as the replacement for Mauricio Pochettino, and that prospect has been met pretty positively among the Saints fanbase. Koeman is of a pedigree unheard of at St Mary’s before, a multiple title winner as both player and manager, a genuine big name, while also having demonstrated a willingness and ability to bring young players through a club’s academy into the first team. As a result, Koeman polling 67% in a four-way race with Claudio Ranieri, Murat Yakin and 'anyone else' probably comes as no surprise. High flyer: Adam Lallana (right) is wanted by Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool . On the move? Luke Shaw has been linked with moves to Manchester United and Chelsea . Giant leaps have been made by the club in the last five years, Koeman could certainly be the man to ensure the perceived glass ceiling doesn’t get reached just yet. His first task, and the key for the majority of the fanbase, will be to persuade last season’s stars that they still have a job to do on the South Coast and that there is no need to seek moves elsewhere as many of their ambitions can still be met here. Whether he will be able to persuade Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren to remain is open to debate – their minds may have already been made up – but if they depart, he will need to ensure the cash received is reinvested wisely. Unsurprisingly, we’re already being linked with young Dutch players in the press, and based on the national team’s demolition of Spain on Friday, that may not be a bad thing. It’s never a dull moment at Southampton, but hopefully things might at least settle down into some sort of sanity for a few months once this appointment is finalised.

"The North Carolina woman who became a quadriplegic at her own bachelorette party after being playfully pushed into a pool and breaking her neck is going to become a mother, thanks to a volunteer surrogate. Rachelle Friedman, 28, postponed her wedding for a year after the shocking accident in 2010, marrying husband Chris Chapman in 2011. Now, a college friend of Friedman's, Laurel Humes, 31, has volunteered to carry the couple's child after following her old friend's story and hearing how she and Chapman were trying to raise $60,000 to pay for a surrogate. Hoping for a family: Rachelle Friedman and her husband Chris Chapman are planning to start a family, with the help of surrogate Laurel Humes . Friend in need: Humes and Friedman knew one another in college and now Humes is going to carry Friedman's child for her . Friedman's most dearly-held wish is to have a family, and she was elated when doctors told her that despite her catastrophic injury, she would be able to carry a child. 'It was very scary,' she told People. 'I knew I was paralyzed and the first thing I asked the paramedics was whether I could have kids. I was ecstatic when they said yes.' However, her joy turned to sadness when she discovered that medications she must take for her blood pressure can be dangerous to a fetus. After reading a post on Friedman's blog about needing a surrogate, Humes, a stay-at-home mother of one, knew she wanted to help. 'My husband was a sperm donor for some of our friends, a same-sex couple, and that inspired me to think about surrogacy,"" Humes of Asheville, North Carolina, told People. 'I'm really excited,' she says. 'I know Chris and Rachelle will be great parents and I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when they get to hold their baby for the first time.' Doctors have retrieved Friedman's eggs and it's expected the fertilized embryos will be transferred into Humes in August . The 28-year-old and her husband Chris, from North Carolina, had launched a crowdfunding campaign last month in a bid to raise money for the procedure, which can cost up to $120,000, but now their financial worries have been put to bed. Friedman says that although she wants a girl, her husband said he would like a 'fishing buddy.' Mother-to-be: Rachelle Friedman and husband Chris Chapman, leave their 2011 wedding reception . Overjoyed: Friedman's eggs were harvested and in August, the fertilized embryos will be implanted in Humes . But their prayers were unexpectedly answered just weeks after setting up their page. Chapman said: 'We had a college friend of ours who . stepped forward and wanted to help out. 'She said she'd already been . looking into surrogacy and wanted to help us start a family.' His overjoyed wife added: 'It's amazing, it wouldn't be possible without her. Surrogacy is astronomically expensive, it's crazy.' Touching on  the discrimination she faced after announcing she wanted children, she added: 'A lot of . people . . .  don't think someone in a wheelchair can be a mother, that . I'm not physically able to take care of a kid but people underestimate . my abilities. 'I think we'll be able to do it. I think we'll be really awesome parents.' Even with their surrogate stepping in for free, the Chapmans say lawyer fees and other expenses will 'add up.' Their fundraising page remains active and to date they have achieved $5,584 in donations. Desperate times: While the North Carolina native (left, before the accident and right, on her wedding day) is biologically able to have children, her medications would be harmful to a fetus . Hopes and dreams: 'I want a child more than anything,' she tweeted last month . Friedman has published a book, The Promise: A Tragic Accident, a Paralyzed Bride, and the Power of Love, Loyalty, and Friendship, which delves into her life before and after she became paralyzed. The accident occurred in 2010, . just weeks before her wedding, when the bride-to-be was at her own . bachelorette party with her four bridesmaids. When . the girls decided to take a dip in the hotel pool one night, one of . them pushed her in and she fell too close to the shallow end. 'I broke my neck upon impact, became paralyzed from the chest down and would never walk again,' she told xoJane.com. It took two-and-a-half months of intensive physical therapy for Friedman to rebuild her upper body strength and regain movement in her arms and fingers. Instead . of resenting her friend, however, Friedman chose to keep her name . secret from the press, in order to prevent them from hounding her and . making her feel guiltier than she already did. New chapter: Friedman's book tells the story of her life, injury and recovery . 'She . is and will always be one of the my closest friends,' she stated, . explaining that her decision to keep her friend's identity a secret is . something she never once questioned. 'It's not our sisterly bond that keeps . me from saying her name in interviews,' she wrote. 'It's the fact that . she's a human being.' Friedman also revealed that the friend who pushed her into the pool has been instrumental in her journey towards motherhood. 'I feel very grateful to have her support and love,' she wrote.","Rachelle Friedman, 28, became a quadriplegic in 2010 at her own bachelorette party .

"Colombia striker Jackson Martinez took the World Cup by the scruff of the neck last night with two brilliantly executed goals in his side's win over Japan. Fans of Portuguese giants Porto have become accustomed to such excellence and here Sportsmail give you the lowdown on the Colombian's super striker. Looking up: Colombian striker Jackson Martinez has excelled at this World Cup for the South Americans . I'm sure I've heard his name before? Definitely, if you haven't then you've been living under a rock for the past couple of years. Martinez has been prolific in the Portuguese Primeira Liga for Porto, scoring 60 goals in 89 starts for the club since arriving from Mexican club Chiapas. Prolific: Martinez has scored 60 goals in 89 appearances for Porto since arriving from Mexican side Chiapas . So is he just a two season wonder? Most certainly not. He carved himself a burgeoning reputation in South America, first with Colombian side Medellin before moving to Chiapas where he spent three seasons scoring 36 goals which alerted Porto to his talents. Curler: Martinez scores his side's third goal in their 3-0 victory over Japan in World Cup Group C . So how did his move to Porto come about? Then Porto manager Vitor Pereira had seen enough to splash out £6.5million on Martinez - quite a sum for a player who was largely unknown in European football during the time. But Pereira's faith paid instant dividends as the Colombian scored on his debut as Porto beat Academica in the Supertaca 2012. And Martinez hasn't stopped scoring since. His performances during his first season in Portugal earned him the nickname 'Jackshow Martinez'. Adored: Porto signed the striker for £6.5m in 2012 and he has since been dubbed 'Jackshow Martinez' Surely Porto will struggle to keep him? It will be difficult, yes. Europe's big guns are circling round the striker after his glowing performances. Arsenal were interested in January and continue to monitor his progress. But Arsene Wenger isn't the only interested party. Atletico Madrid have identified Martinez as a potential replacement for Chelsea-bound Diego Costa. Chelsea and Manchester United have also been linked with moves for the 27-year-old. Not camera shy: Martinez celebrates his third for Colombia, who have a 100 per cent record so far . How much will he cost? He has a £33.2m release clause. Well shouldn't a move for him for Martinez be straight forward then? In essence, yes. But the size of the release clause is the main stumbling block, it certainly was with Arsenal last season. While his goalscoring record in Portugal isn't to be sniffed it, the fear is whether he would be able to carry that form into the Barclays Premier League. And at £33.2m, that's a big gamble to take. Finish: Martinez grabs Colombia's second in the 3-0 win over Japan and is much sought after . Could Arsenal renew their interest this summer? His two goals against Japan on Tuesday night won't have been missed by Wenger, who is in Brazil working for French TV. With Karim Benzema set to sign a new deal at Real Madrid and complexities over Arsenal's interest in Mario Balotelli, Martinez could yet find himself at the Emirates Stadium next season. Interested: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is an admirer of Martinez but may not meet the asking price . Pricey: Although he is much sought-after, Martinez's £33.2m buyout clause may put off suitors .","The striker scored twice for Colombia in 3-0 Group C win over Japan .

London-based AstraZeneca, which produces drugs combating diabetes, high cholesterol and cancer for millions of patients, has already rejected two offers from the maker of Viagra this year, saying they ‘very significantly undervalued AstraZeneca and its prospects’. And yesterday, Pfizer’s chief executive Ian Read admitted that if its takeover bid was successful there are no guarantees that thousands of manufacturing jobs at AstraZeneca will remain in the UK. Overtures: Pfizer has admitted making two multi-0billion pound approaches for UK rival AstraZenica . The firm is one of the largest in Britain and one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies. It has eight factories in the UK and has expanded across the globe to sell billions of pounds worth of its products in more than 100 countries. If the deal goes ahead it will be the latest in a long line of British firms to have fallen prey to foreign takeovers, including Cadbury and Boots the chemist. A merger would create the world’s biggest pharmaceuticals firm, worth £150billion. Pfizer, whose best-known drug is erectile dysfunction treatment Viagra, decided to go public about its takeover intentions after AstraZeneca ‘declined to engage’ in full-blown merger talks. However, the GMB trade union claimed a deal would see the US giant shift UK-based jobs to the Far East. A spokesman said: ‘This is not good news.’ In 2011, Pfizer closed its main research plant in Sandwich, Kent, with the loss of 2,400 jobs. Pfizer now has 28 days to either table a firm offer or walk away. Once it has made an official bid, AstraZeneca would need to seek approval from its shareholders. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘My priority is ensuring there are high-skilled jobs and long-term investment in research and development in the UK. The chief executive of Pfizer has informed me of his intentions, and I have emphasised the importance of these points.’ BY ALEX BRUMMER . If ever there was a  moment to be fearful for Britain’s future as an advanced science-based manufacturing economy it is now. The American bid for AstraZeneca is not only the biggest attempted foreign takeover in UK history, but is a direct assault on high-quality and skilled British jobs. The predator, US drugs giant Pfizer, makes no secret of the reasons why it has cynically targeted the rival British firm. It is because it fears it is running out of ideas for new drug compounds in its own laboratories and also wants the tax advantages of moving its HQ to the UK. Mega deal: The deal for AstraZeneca would be the biggest-ever foreign takeover of a UK business . But if the takeover deal goes ahead, it would have a devastating effect on Britain’s status as home to some of the world’s most respected brands. Since Pfizer shares are quoted in New York, with its main markets in the US and most investors based there, the promise to move to Britain is no more than a ploy to cut taxes and to browbeat AstraZeneca investors into submission and to gull our weak politicians into approving the deal. The challenge is a huge test for Chancellor George Osborne. For only last month he boasted he wanted to create ‘new centres for doctoral training and for cell therapy’ in Britain. Indeed, these are areas where AstraZeneca is a world leader. But Mr Osborne’s patriotism has been questioned. Rather than jumping to the defence of one of the nation’s most successful industries, he seems to have sold the pass, saying that any deal would be ‘a commercial matter between the two companies’. Compare this spineless stance with that of the French government, which in recent days has expressed ‘patriotic concern’ amid talk that the US conglomerate General Electric has bid for its French rival Alstom’s energy business. Sadly, such a failure to support one of the UK’s key industries fits a depressing pattern that has been the shameful mark of both Tory-led and Labour governments, which have allowed a long list of British companies to fall under overseas ownership. Most recently, ministers watched as Cadbury ran up the white flag in the face of the greater financial muscle of American food giant Kraft. Before that, we sold the British airports operator BAA to Spanish group Ferrovial, and control of our ports passed from P&O into foreign hands. And most of our power utilities have been sold to continental giants such as EDF of France. To compound matters, we have even entrusted state-controlled EDF to build our next generation of nuclear power stations with questionable Chinese government money. Overtures: Pfizer has admitted making two multi-0billion pound approaches for UK rival AstraZenica . As for AstraZeneca and the rest of the British pharmaceutical industry, their importance to our current and future economy cannot be over-estimated. This one firm contributes 3 per cent to national output and together with other drug companies (including its bigger rival GlaxoSmithKline) contributes 10 per cent to national output. When a Harvard University academic looked at the sectors of the British economy which hold key competitive advantages over other Western nations, pharmaceuticals and aerospace (along with the currently disgraced financial services sector) came out on top. What’s more, Pfizer has a less than honourable record in Britain. In 2011, its bosses closed its only research and development facility in the UK with the loss of 2,400 research and laboratory jobs. Contrast this with our own drugs industry’s universally admired record of developing new products.  AstraZeneca is planning to spend £350million on a centre at a science park based at Cambridge and is developing new treatments for cancer and respiratory disorders. George Osborne may be reluctant to speak up now in support of AstraZeneca but has, in the past, shown that he recognises how crucial it is to invest in such areas –having offered tax incentives that have had a hugely positive impact on the attractiveness of the UK as a centre for pioneering research. This persuaded Glaxo to bring back to Britain £1billion of investment from labs around the world. Moreover, we should not forget that AstraZeneca, despite its concocted name, is a company with deep British roots – once part of world-famous Imperial Chemical Industries that, with the genius of Liverpool-born Sir John Brunner, was created in the 1920s. If only our politicians had learnt the lessons of history and been alert to the warning signs of allowing British treasure to be flogged to foreigners. For, I fear, we are witnessing a repeat of the Cadbury scandal. Pfizer has promised investors in AstraZeneca that the UK would be the centre of its research activity, but as Cadbury’s buyer Kraft showed, the record of US companies making promises to British shareholders and politicians is pretty disreputable. Kraft pledged to keep open the Cadbury plant near Bristol, but then closed it just weeks after the takeover, moving manufacturing to Poland. It also promised not to cut jobs at Bournville, Cadbury’s spiritual home, but then proceeded to do so. Pfizer, like Kraft, is a company known for buying rivals, cutting costs and absorbing the best parts of the business and then selling off the rest. That is why AstraZeneca should be protected. For too long, our governments have sat idly by as foreign companies have scooped up great swathes of our industrial infrastructure and raided hi-tech companies for their patents. No other nation would countenance the idea of one of its greatest companies falling into overseas hands in a deal that would be bad for jobs, bad for science, bad for UK taxpayers – who, over the years, have invested in the training of these firms’ great brains – and, above all, bad for Britain.","London-based AstraZeneca has rejected two offers from Pfizer already .

"The backlash continues against FA chairman Greg Dyke’s proposal to allow B-teams from big clubs into the lower reaches of the football pyramid. Erik Samuelson, chief executive of AFC Wimbledon, claims Dyke’s idea, revealed on Thursday, will wreck the Football League. He also reminded the Football Association of their duty of care to football at all levels, not only the elite at England and in the Barclays Premier League. Scroll down to read the full statement from the Dons Trust board . Controversial: Grey Dyke's B-team proposal has been criticised from all angles . 'The idea of a B-team league is abysmal,' said Samuelson. 'I don’t think it could ever work and while we have to be cautious I don’t think that’s really the issue. I think this is an idea floated out there when the underlying objective is to create feeder clubs, either directly by takeover of another club of by an extension of the loan system and the significant partnerships. 'For me, it would wreck the Football League. This is a problem the Premier League has. They don’t want to take the risk of blooding youngsters in a league where the cost of failure is enormous and their solution is to reorganise the Football League for their own benefit. 'It is unfortunate that it is the FA which has put this forward because the FA has a job to nourish and protect all of football across England and this comprehensively fails to do that. In fact it will damage it.' AFC Wimbledon was a club created amid . blundering FA directives of the past, when Wimbledon were allowed to . leave south-west London and move to Milton Keynes, where they became MK . Dons. Fourth tier: AFC Wimbledon finished mid-table in League Two this season . AFC was founded in 2002 to replace the lost team. They started in the ninth tier of English football and are now in League Two. 'Football clubs are rooted in their own communities,' said Samuelson. 'People support them and they grow up around them, more so for ours than most but for more or less all clubs. And we can become Premier League team B. Where’s the concern for football fans and the links to the communities? Where’s the respect for a football pyramid that’s hugely successful?' Any shift towards feeder clubs . threatens to eat away at the independence of many smaller clubs and the . angry reaction should come as no surprise to Dyke. 'Greg . Dyke held a meeting with League One and Two clubs at St George’s Park . earlier this year to discuss this sort of thing and he was left in no . doubt how we felt about it,' said Samuelson. 'It is important for us all . that we have a successful England team but the solution is in the hands . of the Premier League.' Wrecking ball: Samuelson believes that Dyke's proposal will damage the Football League . As the elected representatives of the custodians and owners of Wimbledon's Football Club, the Dons Trust board were dismayed to read the report of FA Chairman Greg Dyke's England Commission. These plans appear to be seriously entertaining the idea of parachuting a new tier of league football into the existing pyramid – including B teams of Premier League clubs that consider themselves overburdened with young players who aren't playing enough games. We suspect that no clubs' fans have seen their team play at as many levels of the game in as short a time as Wimbledon fans. From leaving the Premiership at the Dell in June 2000 to re-joining the Football League in 2011 via the Combined Counties League, the Isthmian League and the Conference, Wimbledon have played in every tier from first to ninth of the league pyramid except League One in this century. One of the reasons that Wimbledon fans received so much solidarity from fans of other clubs when our league place was awarded to Milton Keynes by a three-man commission in 2002 was because it so crudely compromised the integrity of the league pyramid structure. Until 2002 no town or club had been awarded a league place off the pitch, every promotion had been won on the merits of what a club's players achieved. Throughout our journey to reclaim our league place, Dons Trust board members met supporters, chairmen, committee men and women and owners at over a hundred non-league clubs. Despite the controversial circumstances of our rebirth, we and other Wimbledon supporters very much enjoyed this journey. We met many amazing people who have dedicated much of their lives to sustaining football clubs in their communities. In 2002 the FA Commission that awarded Wimbledon FC's league place to Milton Keynes actually told Wimbledon fans not to bother restarting, telling us it would not be ""in the wider interests of football."" We proved them wrong many times over. But this proposal to abolish the very founding tenets of the English league structure on a vague promise it might improve the fortunes of the national team is most certainly not in the wider interests of football. It lazily cherry picks elements from other countries' systems that just so happen to serve the narrow interests of an elite group of largely Premier League clubs. The FA has a responsibility to represent and protect its members at all levels of the game. This proposal has been dreamed up without any serious engagement with supporters or even with the Football Conference. Our representative organisations - Supporters Direct and The Football Supporters Federation - were not spoken to or invited to discuss the issues with the commission. This arrogant approach has rightly angered many thousands of football supporters. This proposal as it currently stands is an insult to each and every single club below Championship level and to the hundreds of thousands of fans around the country who watch their local teams across the season. The FA abdicated its responsibilities in 2002 when it sanctioned the franchising of a single club to Milton Keynes. If it pushes ahead with this proposal it will have abdicated its responsibilities to all its members, bar the largest Premier League clubs. The B team proposal is entirely without merit. While we have concerns about other parts of the report – the Strategic Loan Partnerships look to us like feeder clubs by the back door – we believe that the B team proposal brings the entire report into disrepute. We will be happy to engage in a genuine consultation once the report has been withdrawn.","FA chairman Greg Dyke has proposed to introduce Premier League 'B-teams' into the Football League .

"A schoolgirl died in her father’s arms from an allergic reaction after eating curry and chips for tea, an inquest heard. Holly Stuckey, 12, collapsed while fighting for her breath from a sudden anaphylactic shock feared to have been triggered by her food. The hearing was told the 'fit and well' youngster had the meal just an hour before her attack - and told her father: 'I don’t want to die'. Tragedy: Clive and Lee Stuckey hold a picture of their daughter, Holly, who collapsed and died at their home from an allergic reaction after eating curry and chips for dinner despite Mr Stuckey's efforts to save her . Slumped unconscious: Holly Stuckey, pictured in her school uniform (left) and with her beloved pet cat (right), passed out in the bathroom while fighting for breath after going into anaphylactic shock . One of Britain’s top allergy experts said it was 'possible' that the chips had triggered the fatal reaction. Dr Richard Pumphrey told the inquest: 'She had eaten chips and there have been occasions when chips have contained something other than potato. 'It is a possibility - it has been reported in the past, but we are struggling to find a cause.' The inquest heard that only child Holly had asthma, but had not suffered any food allergies in the past. 'I did my best': Holly's father Clive, pictured with his wife, Lee, in their daughter's bedroom, tried in vain to resuscitate the 12-year-old after she told him: 'I don't want to die' But Dr Pumphrey, described as an . eminent expert, said he suspected it was a reaction to her food because . of her symptoms and the timing of the attack. The . inquest heard that on the day of the tragedy Holly had been shopping . with her dad Clive, 44, and returned to their home in Maesteg, near . Bridgend, South Wales. Mr Stuckey said: 'I did her curry and chips, but she didn’t eat much - she was a picky child. 'After the meal, she was complaining she had trouble breathing. She had two puffs on her blue inhaler and one on her purple one. 'She was saying: ""I don’t want to die."" I was telling her to calm down and relax to help her get her breath back.' Cause of reaction unknown: Holly, seen here on a family holiday with her father, was described at her inquest as 'fit and well' at the time of her death . The inquest in Aberdare heard Mr Stuckey took his little girl to the bathroom where she slumped unconscious. He said: 'I put her on her side and started giving her CPR while my wife (Lee) rang for the emergency services. 'I . have been trained in what to do because of my work - I have fetched a . few people back. I did my best - I wish I could have done more.' Holly was taken to hospital, but a crash team was unable to revive her. Bridgend Coroner Louise Hunt recorded a narrative verdict that Holly died of anaphylactic reaction of unknown cause. After her death, Holly’s father found letters which described alleged bullying at her school. Mr Stuckey passed on a list of 13 names of pupils to Maesteg Comprehensive School where an investigation was carried out. He said after the hearing: 'The school carried out an inquiry and told us there was no proof that Holly was being bullied.'","Holly Stuckey collapsed fighting for breath after eating curry and chips .

"Rebecca Rivers, 21, is accused of punching her landlord Peter Edwards in the chest during an argument despite knowing he had a heart condition . A young woman who punched a heart patient in the chest triggering a fatal seizure has gone on trial for manslaughter. Rebecca Rivers, 21, landed several blows in Peter Edwards’ chest despite being fully aware of his delicate medical condition, it is alleged. As a result the 64-year-old slumped to the floor clutching his chest and begged for his angina spray to ease the pain. But just moments later after he suffered a fatal heart attack and died, telling his wife: 'It’s not working, I’m going.' Rivers denies manslaughter at the flat they shared in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, in November last year. Bristol Crown Court heard Mr Edwards’ medical problems first began in 2000 when he suffered a heart attack. He made a good recovery and quickly went back to work, while relying on medication. But he soon became worse again and by 2011 he was beginning to experience more chest pain and was having to rely on his medication more regularly. In 2012 Rivers moved in with Mr Edwards and his wife Sandra. His health deteriorated even further and he was prescribed a special spray to relieve the symptoms of angina. He used the spray at times of stress, and was due to have a heart operation in December last year. Fiona Elder, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Edwards’ heart condition was not a secret. When there were arguments it would often cause Mr Edwards to use his spray. 'Rebecca Rivers was told he needed a heart operation and was told her arguments set off his heart problems.' The court heard that during an argument in September last year, Mr Edwards collapsed in front of Rivers, needing his medication. Mrs . Edwards told the court she warned Rivers a number of times arguments in . the flat were not fair on her husband, due to the stress on his heart. Mr Edwards' wife, Sandra, said the couple asked Rivers to leave their home because she was abusive. Mrs Edwards told the court that Rivers began shouting, before punching Mr Edwards in the chest . Mrs Edwards told the jury at Bristol Crown Court that she explained her husband's condition to Rivers, and told her to stop arguing with him because it made his heart problems worse . But Mrs Edwards said Rivers became abusive again on November 5 last year after being told to leave the home because of her aggression, shouting at Mr Edwards: 'Go on, hit me! Go on, hit me!' The jury was told Mr Edwards replied: 'I’ve never hit a woman in my life. Why would I start now?' Mrs Edwards said Rivers then punched her husband several times in the chest. She told the court: 'Pete clutched his chest. He said ""I want you to ring the police, I want a restraining order on her, I don’t know what she’ll do next"".' Sobbing, Mrs Edwards continued: 'He asked for his spray. He used it. He collapsed on the floor. He said ""It’s not working, I’m going"".' Mr Edwards was taken to hospital but died at Bristol Royal Infirmary on November 10. The trial continues.

"Greenpeace has sent its Rainbow Warrior ship to obstruct the removal of the Costa Concordia from the coast of Italy. Two and a half years after the cruise liner struck rocks and sank off the island of Giglio, killing 32 people, authorities are finally preparing to remove it. Last summer it was finally wrested off the rocks and refloated in an unprecedented engineering operation. Authorities are preparing to remove the Costa Concordia (pictured last week) two and a half years after it struck rocks and sank off the island of Giglio . Greenpeace has sent its Rainbow Warrior ship (pictured in May this year) to obstruct the removal of the cruise liner . Later this month the giant cruise ship is to make its final journey – it will be towed to the northern Italian port of Genoa where it will be dismantled and sold for scrap. Greenpeace Italy claims the five day journey is fraught with danger because of the risk that toxic fluids still in the wreck could leak into the marine environment. Any storm at sea could be catastrophic as the boat could end up in deep sea where it would be unsalvageable. Now the Rainbow Warrior is staging a protest at the site of the wreck. The five day journey to Genoa is fraught with danger because of the risk that toxic fluids still in the wreck could leak into the marine environment, Greenpeace Italy claims . Greenpeace Italy has said there are 'nearer ports that can be reached easily and with less risks' Luca Lacoboni, of Greenpeace Italy, said: ‘We cannot permit another environmental disaster. ‘To drag the wreck to Genoa would mean five days at open sea. The environmental risks are enormous in terms of leaking of poisonous fluids from the ship and in terms of the structure breaking down. ‘There are nearer ports that can be reached easily and with less risks.’ Genoa beat off many other contenders including ports in Turkey and the UK to win the lucrative contract, which will provide hundreds of jobs over two years. A spokesman for Costa Cruises said that technical and . engineering assessments have confirmed that the wreck removal plan was safe, . even in severe weather conditions. 'The wreck will be towed at low speed – average of 2 . knots - and will be escorted by other vessels, with equipment and specialised . personnel, including a team of marine biology experts and marine mammal . observers, ready to intervene should any problem arise.' Environmental safety would be the 'priority' of the wreck . removal team, she said.","Authorities preparing to remove cruise liner two and a half years after it sank .

"A dog has been reunited with its owners four years since he was stolen from their home after a friend spotted it for sale on Facebook. Cotton, a Staffordshire bull terrier, was taken from Joanna Martin’s previous home in Hartcliffe in Bristol on October 25, 2008, after she had gone out to visit her mother who lives nearby. But she never gave up hope that one day she would be reunited with her 'little boy'. Amazed: Cotton the dog, pictured with one of his owners Katie Martin, six, was discovered for sale on Facebook four years after being stolen . And now her daughters Kira, 12, and Katie, six - who is the same age as Cotton - are making up for lost time with their pet. Joanna, 31, was still checking that shops kept up posters of her missing dog as recently as last year, and continued to check for details of dogs for sale with similar descriptions. Then a friend who used to occasionally walk Cotton spotted a dog for sale through social networking site Facebook and showed it to Joanna, from Knowle, Bristol. She arranged to view the dog, and contacted the police to inform them of her intentions. Officers met her at the property and went in, arresting a woman in her early 20s for handling stolen goods. Family reunion: Katie, six, and Kira, 12, proudly pose with the Staffordshire bull terrier and Pc John Shaddick after the dog's safe return . Joanna, a full-time mum, said that Cotton had always been a part of the family. She said: 'Cotton is just three weeks older than my middle daughter Katie, who took it hardest when he was away - they were always with each other. 'He was my baby boy - after having girls, he was one of the kids. He used to sulk if Katie had sweets and he didn’t. 'So when he was taken the whole family felt the loss. 'I got the impression they were looking to steal the dog because there were lots of items they could have taken and they didn’t. 'Cotton is a very unusual-looking Staffordshire bull terrier and I had many offers to buy him because of his unusual patterning. 'I had just popped to my mum’s house and was out for about an hour. It was not very long at all. 'He was quite a good guard dog and we used to leave the back door unlocked. 'My first thought when I got home was that he had escaped as there were no signs of a burglary or anything.' Despite having been missing for almost four years, Joanna did not stop checking for Cotton, even visiting the dogs’ home regularly searching for him. She added: 'I never wanted to give up hope. I would check that shops still had posters up - they wanted to take them down after a year but I would say how dogs are sometimes found after two years. 'He even had his own Facebook page.' When she first saw the picture of her dog on a selling page on the website after almost four years, she knew straight away that it was Cotton. 'When I saw his picture I burst into tears, I couldn’t believe it after all this time,' she said. Home comforts: Police confirmed that a woman in her early 20s has been arrested in connection with the theft of Cotton from the family home . 'I rang up as a potential customer to buy him and asked all the questions about how old he was and all that. 'When I found him I said I wasn’t going to go home without him.' She went straight over to the address and police officers were already there waiting for her. Joanna added: 'The police were fantastic.They came out and asked me for any identifiable marks he had and I explained that there was a scar across his left leg from where another dog had attacked him. If it wasn’t for that scar I don’t know if we’d have got him.' When she returned home with Cotton on Wednesday night friends and family were already there to welcome him home. Avon and Somerset Police confirmed they arrested a woman in her early 20s on suspicion of handling stolen goods and that investigations are ongoing. - Joanna Martin . PC John Shaddick said: 'I’m delighted to have assisted in Cotton being reunited with his loving owners. There was no doubt that he also shared my delight from his reaction on seeing the family. 'Upon arrival at the scene PC Andrew George and myself were told that the dog was aggressive towards police officers but this soon proved untrue as Cotton was a very friendly chap. 'Burglary is an awful crime and we understand, as in this case, that it can mean much more than just the inconvenience of an insurance claim. 'To assist in returning a loved pet to its rightful home and go some way to making a bad situation better was a real heart warming experience. 'I just hope that Cotton can now enjoy being pampered and the family can make up for lost time. They all look very happy together.'","Cotton, a Staffordshire bull terrier, was snatched from family's home in Hartcliffe in 2008 .

"Surveillance cameras captured the moment every door at a maximum-security jail wing in Florida swung open and released a flock of violent criminals, who ganged up and attacked another inmate with vicious homemade knives. The inmate was forced to jump over a railing and fall one story to escape his assailants, who are believed to be members of a rival gang in the Miami neighborhood of Liberty City. The Miami-Dade Corrections Department says it still doesn't know why the security system unlocked and opened every door in the maximum-security wing of the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center on June 14. However, two inmates immediately crept out of their cells - seemingly moving with purpose - as soon as the doors slid open. Scroll down for video . Open sesame: Two inmates crept out of their cells the moment the doors slid open - leading to speculation that they knew they would be released . Target: The men ganged up to attack Kenneth Williams, left, who is the leader of a rival gang. The men were allegedly armed with homemade prison shivs . The Miami Herald reports that this has led some to speculate that the prisoners knew that their doors would open and that they were waiting to be let out to execute their attack. The Herald obtained a copy of the June 14 surveillance video. It shows an attack on Kenneth Williams, believed to be a leader of the New Moneii gang that deals drugs in a Liberty City public housing project, by three rival gang members - all of whom were allegedly armed with shivs - crude prison knives. Williams jumped over a railing and landed on the floor below to escape his assailants. He can be seen writhing in pain, holding his leg. Doctors later said he suffered a fractured vertebrae and a broken ankle. Williams, pursued by armed assailants, hikes up his trousers and throws himself over a railing to escape the knife-wielding inmates . Williams, seen on the floor after his fall, broke his ankle and shattered a vertebra when he landed on story below . Williams is believed to be the leader of a violent Miami street gang . Williams was awaiting trial on charges he tried to intimidate witnesses testifying against two gunmen accused of killing one of Williams' rivals and his 10-month-old son. The Herald reports that police suspect Williams ordered the hit, but have been unable to produce evidence to charge him. The beleaguered Maimi-Dade Corrections Department said it is still working to figure out why the doors in the maximum security wing opened. Inmates in that wing are never let out of their cells more than a few at a time and are never allowed to mingle in common areas together. In May, a similar incident allowed the computerized control panel to open all doors on the wing when a guard accidentally pushed the wrong button. After that happened, a safety was installed that forced jailers who pressed the button to open all doors to confirm the selection first. Still the Corrections Department claims that no jailer released the doors. Williams' lawyer questions that conclusion.","Computer glitch blamed for doors at Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center being thrown open .

"Gus Poyet is refusing to discuss individual names for fear of missing out on yet more transfer targets. The Uruguayan is concerned that information is leaking out of the club and will investigate the source of such. Sunderland are in talks with Inter Milan winger Ricky Alvarez over a loan move and, with defender Valentin Roberge set for a return to France, they will turn to Celtic’s £6million-rated Virgil van Dijk as replacement. Scared: Poyet says there could be a leak at Sunderland, and is investigating . Oops: Sunderland missed out on Napoli striker Eduardo Vargas, who signed for QPR this week . But Poyet – who lost Napoli striker Eduardo Vargas to QPR last week – remains nervous as the transfer window enters its final weekend. ‘I don’t want to lose any more targets. When you mention a name then someone else gets involved,’ he said. ‘Another club gets involved, the player wants more money and in the end he doesn’t come.’ He went on: ‘In the last week or 10 days we've been very close to things but they didn't happen. It's not good enough if we don't add to the squad. ‘It's about having the right squad to go from here to January and that's the key and we're working on it. ‘We've been through many things, looking at price and, over the next few years, if you'll get money back.’ Meanwhile, Poyet has reacted to news of Jack Colback’s call-up to the England squad. The Newcastle midfielder only left Sunderland during the summer, and Poyet said: ‘I think Jack will agree with us that he spent all his career here and he knows how much this football club helped him and built him into the player he is today. Call-up: Poyet believes that Jack Colback is in the national side '98%' because of Sunderland's influence . ‘If he’s in the national team, how much is up to Sunderland and how much up to Newcastle? ‘In my opinion it’s 98 per cent to Sunderland and two per cent to Newcastle.

"A heroic off-duty firefighter who helped rescue a young boy after finding him in a pool of his own blood has revealed how he gave Martin Richard two breaths of CPR before covering the eight-year-old victim's lifeless body. After Matt Patterson and brave stranger, Michael Chase, saved the life of the unidentified boy whose leg had been blown off by running him a block and a half to waiting ambulances, the 30-year-old sprinted back to the bomb site to help more victims. There he came across little Martin, one of three people who were killed in the twin bombings at Monday's Boston Marathon. 'We just knew he was gone,' Patterson told MailOnline. 'He had very serious, serious injuries. We took a sheet and covered him.' Patterson also helped a third victim, a . man in his 30s, after it was confirmed the Dorchestor, Massachusetts, . eight-year-old had succumbed to his horrific injuries. Scroll down for video . Hero: Matt Patterson, left, gave Martin Richard, right, two breathes of CPR before covering the eight-year-old victim's lifeless body . Patterson said multiple people were trying to save Martin, but he believes he had already lost his battle when he arrived at his side. 'When I reached him there were just people helping as best they could,' he said. 'His clothes were torn and charred. I can't say if they were ripped from the blast or from people trying to save him.' He said the boy was very pale and was laying on his back. 'There was nothing in his eyes,' Patterson said, clearly impacted by what he saw. At that point, Patterson, who is a Lynn firefighter, rushed to help another victim - this time a man in his 30s whose left leg had been amputated. He said by that stage Boston firefighters were on the scene and one member, whose name is unknown, helped him use a shoelace as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. Life-savers: Matt Patterson, center, an off-duty firefighter, and Michael Chase, left, a trained police officer who works with troubled youths, ran the boy, in Patterson's arms, a full block and a half to medical teams . 'He had charring and burns on his clothes,' he told MailOnline. 'His clothes were still smoking when we cut them off. We carried him to an ambulance but it already had four people in the back of it so we had to find him another one. There were so many victims.' The day began like any other Boston Marathon for the firefighter who was celebrating the sporting event with some drinks at a Boylston Street restaurant with his girlfriend and some friends. But when he heard the first boom, he knew straight away that something wasn't right. 'It was very distinct to me,' Patterson said. 'I had an immediate recognition of that sound. It's just a feeling. My girlfriend looked at me and knew something was wrong. Then the second blast went off and I knew for a fact it wasn't a joke.' He said he yelled at the people around him to get to the back of the restaurant, ensuring his girlfriend was among them, and then rushed out onto the street, which is when he noticed the first young victim. Listen to Patterson's story from itemlive here: . Firefighter: Patterson, seen here fighting a fire, and speaking about his heroism Monday said has said he just wants to find out the boy he helped is doing. 'It'd make me feel better to know if we helped one person' Brave: Michael Chase, left, and Dan Marshall, right, both sprung into action and rushed to the aid of wounded children following the explosions . 'You get that initial shock and your eyes close,' he said of the immediate aftermath of the explosion. 'When I opened my eyes I saw chaos. There were people running and that's when I noticed the boy. 'He was far too small to be an adult so I immediately knew it was a child lying in the road, he was lying in a pool of blood. I ran over and noticed he had a clear amputation of his right leg.' He said the boy, aged he thinks between seven and eight, was in severe shock. 'I was talking to him, asking his name,' Patterson told MailOnline. 'My best recognition is that it was Shane or Sean. He was so close to the blast, his hair was blown back like someone got a hairdryer and blew it back. 'He must have been thrown through the air. I was out of the restaurant so fast and he was already in the middle of the street.' He said the boy had suffered a full amputation of his right leg. 'There was just soft tissue and muscle hanging,' he recalled. 'Ten seconds earlier he was having a great time in the street and the next second his whole life has changed.' That's when the firefighter teamed up with heroic stranger Michael Chase. Overwhelming: Michael Chase, posing for a picture with his family, said the boy they saved was 'a little peanut of a thing' like his young daughter . Fate: Patterson and Chase, pictured with wife Dena, were thrown together by fate and worked as a team to save the bleeding boy . 'I identified myself as an off-duty . firefighter. I asked him for his belt and we used it as a tourniquet to . the boy's leg. We needed to get him help so we carried him a block and a . half to the ambulance.' He added, emotionally: 'We definitely saved that kid's life.' Patterson said he's seen some pretty . horrific things in his years as a firefighter, but Monday's shocking . events probably come out on top. 'This would have to rank up there,' he told MailOnline. 'You never think you're going to have to treat a . seven or eight-year-old child in the middle of Boylston Street at the Boston . Marathon and then you turn around and see 40 more people who need help. 'It's not helplessness, but there's a . feeling you can only do so much. I've had that feeling before of being . helpless. It was an awful feeling. But I'm glad I did my (medics) training, and everything kicked in at the right time.' Chase, who is trained as a police . officer but doesn't work in the field because of a medical condition, . agreed that the senseless events were overwhelming. Investigation: People in protective suits rake and examine material on Boylston Street in Boston on Thursday as the investigation into the bombing continues . Runners continue to run towards the finish line of the Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts near the finish line . Describing the boy they helped . as 'a little peanut of a thing,' Chase, 34, told the Boston Herald of . the blasts' immediate aftermath: 'I have a 4-year-old daughter. It was all too much.' Chase's friend, Dan Marshall, was among the people Patterson encountered who were trying to save Martin Richard. 'He was the first one I saw, and I sprung to him. I wish I could've helped more,' Marshall told The Salem News. 'It's extremely sad.' Neither . Patterson nor Chase, who stayed with the victim's shaken older brother . until his father collected him, got the family's details in the chaos. Therefore, they have no way of knowing the injured boy's condition. 'I'd like to learn how he's doing. It'd make me feel better to know,' he said. 'It was the right place at the right time,' Chase told the Herald. 'I was glad I was able to help Matt. It was inspirational to work with someone like that.' Boston Children's Hospital wouldn't give any details to MailOnline about whether one of the nine kids admitted to the hospital matched the description of the young victim. As of Thursday, the hospital has two patients in critical condition and one who is out of ICU and in good condition. They would not give details of their ages. Boston Medical Center has a five-year-old boy still in critical condition.","Matt Patterson, an off-duty firefighter, was among those trying to save Martin Richard, one of the three victims who died in the bombing .

"Killed: Imani Green, eight, was on a family holiday in Jamaica and shot dead after an assailant opened fire at a grocery store . Eight suspects were last night being ‘intensively interrogated’ by police over the murder of British schoolgirl Imani Green in Jamaica. The island’s authorities said they are confident of solving the killing of the eight-year-old, who is believed to have been an innocent victim of gangsters fighting a turf war over an illegal lottery scam. Imani, who suffered from the debilitating blood disorder sickle cell anaemia, was in the Caribbean for an extended holiday to help alleviate the symptoms of her condition. The youngster, from Balham, south London, was shot in the head and shoulder when a masked gunman opened fire in the roadside shop and bar run by her cousin. Police said the suspects, all men under 35, were being ‘intensely interrogated’ at three separate jails following raids on properties close to the shooting in Duncans, a town on the island’s north-west coast, following tip-offs from the public. A police spokesman said: ‘Over the last 24 hours eight people have been taken into custody and we’re confident we will make a breakthrough soon.’ Imani’s grandmother Sandra Fisher welcomed the arrests. Mrs Fisher, 54, said: ‘I’m pleased with our community for giving over the information, I think it’s because it’s the death of a child.’ Deputy Superintendent Steve Brown, . from the Jamaica Constabulary Force, said the eight suspects were being . questioned but dismissed suggestions linking the shooting to gang . warfare. He told the BBC: . 'Over the last 24 hours there have been some developments where the . police have taken eight persons into custody and we're confident we will . make a breakthrough on this one very soon. 'We've . heard about gang warfare but we find it a bit difficult to believe . because where the incident took place it is a sleepy community, nothing . happens there. 'This . is just an isolated incident but it could well link to a number of . things and we are looking at all possibilities and following all the . leads that we are getting.' Imani was attending a local primary school while on the island and had been due to return to the UK on January 25. Meanwhile, a man has been shot dead half a mile away from the cafe where Imani died. Yesterday’s killing is believed to be related to Imani’s death. One local, who would not be named, said: . ‘People are whispering that he knew too much – he knew who killed the little girl. That’s why he got shot.’ Tragic death: Imani Green (pictured left by herself and right with her mother Donna, both in 2009) was at her cousin's small shop on the island's north coast, when violence broke out during an argument . Three of Imani's relatives were taken to hospital after they were wounded in the hail of bullets.It has been claimed they were gunned down in a reprisal for a shooting which happened several months ago and is connected to a telemarketing scam.The racket involves tricking people in America into thinking they’ve scooped the lottery and getting them to wire an ‘advance fee’ to collect their winnings.Around £30million was sent to Jamaica last year alone and the sums involved have led to disputes among the criminals who collect it.The scam has been linked to 500 murders in the past five years and is responsible for half of violent crime in the area where Imani was killed. The little girl was hit in the head by a bullet from the shooter's 9mm pistol, before being struck in the shoulder by a second bullet. Grandmother Mrs Fisher said . she found Imani lying in a 'pool of blood' after she asked to visit the . grocery shop in the quiet Red Dirt district of Duncans in Trelawny . parish. Her sister Jamila Palmer, 19,said; ‘We heard gunshots. We ran outside and shouted “Imani, . Imani, Imani”. I picked her up off the ground and realised she was still . breathing. 'I picked her up off the ground and . realised she was still breathing. I flagged down a car and they drove us . to hospital. The rest is history.' Neighbours in Britain have spoken of their sorrow following the killing. Relatives were said to have left . their home at Old Hospital Close for a flight to Jamaica early yesterday . morning to be with Imani's mother. Imani had been enrolled in a Jamaican school to keep her education ticking over. Her . brother Dean Palmer, 27, described her as ‘an extremely brave girl’ who . visited the island twice a year to help with the energy-sapping . illness. Family: The girl was visiting relatives in the small town of Duncans, a rural area on the north coast of the Caribbean island . Headteacher of . Fircroft school, Anne Wilson, yesterday confirmed she had given Imani . time off to seek respite for her  condition, adding: ‘Imani was a happy, . playful child who was popular with staff and pupils alike. ‘She dealt with her illness very bravely and coped well with the special arrangements we had to have in place to support her.’ A relative in London said: ‘Imani was . playing out with some other little  children. Her mother came back from . shopping and told her to come indoors. ‘But Imani begged to stay out. She said “OK, five more minutes and then come inside”. After that they heard gunshots. ‘When she ran out Imani was on the floor in a pool of blood.’ It has been claimed that innocent bystanders, including Imani, were deliberately shot by the gunman. Education: Imani attended Fircroft Primary School in Tooting, south London, near her home in Balham . Home: The three-storey, semi-detached property in Balham, south-west London, where Imani Green, eight, was said to have lived . A source said; ‘The killer shot the little girl in the head with his first bullet. The second bullet hit her in the shoulder. ‘He then turned the gun on to the other three – two women and a man all related to Imani.’ Sickle cell anaemia is an inherited genetic blood condition. People with the condition have sickle haemoglobin (HbS), rather than regular haemoglobin (HbA) - the protein in red blood cells which carries oxygen. Regular red blood cells can easily bend and travel around blood vessels without any problems - but sickle haemoglobin sticks together when giving oxygen to tissues. This makes red blood cells sickle-shaped and less able to move. They can easily block small blood vessels and this prevents oxygen from getting through and can damage organs. Sufferers should avoid wearing tight clothing, dehydration and cold temperatures - as well as maintaining a good diet. It . was suggested that the reason for this was because gunmen in Jamaica . will target the innocent if they cannot find their intended victim. A . neighbour of the family in South London, who is Jamaican and whose . cousin was murdered three years ago, said: ‘This is the way they take . revenge. ‘There is a saying out there “If I can’t catch you, I will catch someone for you”.’ But the girl’s uncle, Mitchum Brown, . claimed the shooting was a revenge attack after a row with the owner of . the store, who is Imani’s cousin. Mr Brown added Imani was a ‘quiet, lovely, friendly girl’ who had only just begun to grow in confidence. Her father Richard Green, 38, a decorator, was in Britain when he learned of his daughter’s death and was taken to hospital after collapsing in shock. Imani was said to be ‘his life’. Yesterday, he left the family’s four-bedroom semi-detached home with other family members to fly out to the Caribbean. The Foreign Office is providing consular assistance and is liaising with the Jamaican authorities. MP for Tooting and Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan said he was ‘devastated’ to hear the news of the shooting.","Imani Green, of London, shot on Friday night in Duncans, Trelawny Parish .

"Iran could launch a Lockerbie-style terrorist strike if it is hit with an international oil embargo, an academic warned last night. Professor Paul Stevens, a senior research fellow at think-tank Chatham House, said it was ‘extremely unlikely’ Tehran would not retaliate against crippling sanctions. However, he said he doubted it would carry out its threat to blockade the Straits of Hormuz, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, for fear of creating a ‘shooting war’ with the U.S. The Lockerbie atrocity saw Pan Am Flight 103 from London to New York brought down by a bomb planted on the orders of Gaddafi . Shipping route: Iranian authorities have threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, pictured, which could have a heavy impact on gas prices for UK consumers . Household bills: British Gas signed a three-year deal for gas supply with Qatar last February . Instead, Professor Stevens claimed . that blocking oil exports to America and the EU would encourage . hardliners inside the Islamic state to retaliate, adding: ‘There could . even be a Lockerbie-type response from within Iran.’ The UK could face losing up to a half of its gas imports if Iran does carry through its threat to close a vital shipping route. Iran . has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against . international sanctions imposed because of its nuclear development . programme. Closing the . Strait would block a trade route through which 46 per cent of Britain's . gas imports pass en route from Qatar, while 84 per cent of the UK's . Liquefied Natural Gas imports use the same route. According to the Department of Energy and Climate change, the imports through the strait represent 15 per cent of Britain's total gas supply. The increasing stand-off in the Gulf has caused several spikes in oil prices in recent weeks and a former military chief has warned that Britain would have to weather the economic fall-out should the closure occur. 'I have no doubt at all that this would be the biggest problem for us,' Lord West, former head of the Royal Navy and security adviser to Gordon Brown, told the Financial Times. Britain has increasingly relied on gas imports from Qatar since 2010 - increasing the supply by 67 per cent - with supply from Norway dropping 17 per cent and North Sea supplies shrinking. From August to October last year, the most recent period for which the DECC has data, all the UK’s LNG imports – or 46 per cent of its total gas demand – came from Qatar. In February 2011 Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, signed a three-year deal with Qatar for LNG supply over the next three years. There were also hints that a 10-year deal could be agreed. Not just gas: Oil ships such as these provide constant traffic through the Strait as it carries one-fifth of the world's oil . Narrow options: This image of the Strait, taken from Nasa's International Space Station, shows why the route is so important, as there is no alternative . Britain's gas supply is at risk because it buys from such a narrow pool of suppliers and there is no viable export alternative for Qatar than the Strait, which carries a fifth of the world’s oil and one-third of its LNG. A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: 'We are aware of the importance of Hormuz, both in terms of oil and liquefied natural gas imports to the UK. 'We are therefore working across Whitehall on this issue. Relevant ministers have been briefed. 'We have a variety of potential gas suppliers and energy sources should we need to draw upon them, including pipelines to mainland Europe and Norway, and our own North Sea. 'The UK has access to a wide variety of gas sources and routes, including production from the UK Continental Shelf, imports from Norway and from the Continent, LNG from global markets and gas storage. Added complication: The energy crisis is not helped by March elections in, meaning Mahmoud Ahmadinejad needs to appear tough . 'In addition, at times of market . tightness, mechanisms on the demand-side such as switching to coal in . the power sector can be used to ensure demand and supply balance.' Britain's gas supply has shifted . increasingly towards LPG. It now accounts for around a fifth of UK . supply and that reliance is expected to grow. By 2015 the UK is forecast to import about two-thirds of its gas, rising to about 80 per cent in 2020. Though a potential closure would have a very heavy impact on Britain's gas supplies it would have less of an impact on the UK's oil supply, with less than one per cent arriving by that route. A 2008 report by Lehman Brothers listed the Strait as the world's top 'choke point' for oil supply. There has been strong momentum for energy sanctions since the publishing of a U.N. watchdog report saying Iran appeared to have worked on designing an atom bomb. Western countries suspect Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons capability. Iran says it is only interested in nuclear technology for peaceful purposes such as generating electricity. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Sunday he was 'confident' the 27-member European Union would impose resounding sanctions on Iran's oil industry and possibly other sectors at an EU foreign ministers meeting on January 23. Mr Hague said: 'Our sanctions are part of trying to get Iran to change course and to enter negotiations and we should not be deterred from implementing those. We will continue to intensify our own sanctions and those of the European Union.' The issue is also being clouded by Iran's upcoming presidential elections in March, which means the government in Tehran needs to be seen as acting strongly on these critical issues.","Iran probably won't blockade Straits of Hormuz, though, says expert ."
