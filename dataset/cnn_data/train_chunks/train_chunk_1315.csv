The greatest thanks to the HFPA, and to Jane Hawking for entrusting me with performing her moving and inspirational life story,' Jones said after learning of her nomination.

"Angels are everywhere during the festive season adorning trees and nativity scenes but there are none quite like Georgia May Jagger in the new advert for Thierry Mugler. The models goes bra-less in her latest Angel commercial for the fragrance giants with only the perfume bottle to protect her modesty. In the advert, which is currently being broadcast in cinemas across the UK, she struts towards the camera like she's walking down a catwalk. Sultry: Georgia May Jagger in the new advert for Thierry Mugler's Angel perfume . Birth of a star: The first shot shows just a silhouette of the model and images of the universe . Flip book: The frame is split into three as images of Georgia's body and legs change . Quick change: The 22-year-old model is seen in a number of different outfits including a sequin blazer . On fire: Flames fill one scene in the advert which is described as 'as explosive as the iconic fragrance' The first shot shows just the silhouette of her figure with images on the universe projected on it. The frame is then divided into the three - like in a children's flip book where the image can be changed to show a different bodies or legs. In the Angel ad, Georgina's head always remains but the pictures of her body and legs change to show her in different outfits including a glittery blazer and a gold dress. At times, the visuals are artistic and futuristic showing her surrounded by the universe, flames or smoke in the shape of angels wings fanning behind her. The final shot shows her in just leather trousers holding the perfume bottle with the slogan 'beware of angels'. Like mother, like daughter: Georgia May features in the Angel advert 19 years after Jerry Hall was the face of the fragrance . Angel effect reinvented: Many of the looks are futuristic . Grew up with the brand: The model said she was honoured to be a part of the campaign like her mother . After seeing the finished result, Georgia said: 'It is amazing and very different from previous campaigns. It represents a very modern idea of femininity.' It's certainly an edgier advert to those involving Georgia's mother Jerry Hall, now 58, who was the face of the scent between 1995 to 1997. In one of her adverts for the brand, she was pictured lying in the desert in a glittery ballgown. Georgina, 22, said she was delighted to be following in her mother's footsteps when it was announced that she was the new face of Angel earlier this year. She said on Instagram at the time: 'So honoured to be the new face of Angel fragrance by #ThierryMugler 19 years after my mother.' Revealing: In the final shots, only the perfume bottle protects her modesty and angel wings appear . Impressed: Georgia May said she thinks the advert 'represents a very modern idea of femininity' She added in an interview with Vogue that she grew up the the fragrance thanks to her mother's involvement with it. She said: 'My mother was a muse of Mugler and appeared regularly in his Paris runway shows. I have such wonderful memories of the fragrance and my mother's involvement with the Mugler brand. 'It's very special to me to be following in my mother's footsteps.' Keeping it in the family: Georgia said it's 'very special to me to be following in my mother's footsteps' Angelic: Jerry Hall in her campaign for the brand in the Nineties . Explaining the idea behind the latest advert, the Thierry Mugler website states: 'The new Angel campaign is as explosive as the iconic fragrance. It is the ""Angel effect"" reinvented. 'Born from the explosion of a star, the fragrance trail that remains forms the shape of a woman, an angel. 'Chic, seductive and ultra-feminine, she asserts herself with determination and confidence. She is mesmerising and triumphant. In her hands she holds her star, her fragrance.' It adds: 'Georgia introduces a new era in the story of Angel and was quite an obvious choice as her mother Jerry Hall already has a close connection to the brand.'","Model was announced as new face of the scent earlier this year .

We are here visiting family, this was a really big surprise. I'm actually trying to keep quiet, so I don't wake up the rest of the house, but I really want to scream with joy and throw a party right now.'

"She's a mainstay on glossy magazine covers and is even the face of Bulgari jewellery. And now, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has revealed why she loves the limelight. The singer opened up in an interview ahead of the release of a TV documentary on her musical tour across the US and France. She explained that she has an obsession with 'exhibiting' and it's down to a part of her that is 'a bit rotten, alone or infantile'. Candid: Speaking in an interview ahead of the release of a TV documentary on her musical tour across the US and France, Carla Bruni opened up about her family life and why she loves exhibiting herself . Speaking to Le Parisien newspaper, she said: 'It's as if there is an inconsistency in who I am, an uncertainty of being alive that pushes me to exhibit myself. 'It's a part of me that is a bit rotten, alone or infantile that needs this. 'I don't know where this devouring need for recognition comes from. I think it is because I am a b*****d. Otherwise I wouldn't put myself through all of this.' Carla, 47, is legally the daughter Marisa Borini - a concert pianist - and composer Alberto Bruni Tedeschi. It was revealed in 2008, in an interview with Vanity Fair, that her biological father is actually a grocery entrepreneur called Maurizio Remmert from Italy. Carla was the result of a six-year affair he had with her mother, then 19. Explanation: Carla, pictured, left, on Versace's catwalk in 1996 and, right, walking for Vivienne Westwood in 1994, believes that perhaps her devouring need for recognition is because she is a 'b*****d' The model-turned-singer also discussed her rise to stardom and dismissed claims that her well-connected family helped her on her way. She may be the heiress to a lucrative tyre company founded by her legal grandfather in 1920, but Carla insists that she 'struggled' to succeed, particularly due to her shyness. Signed at the tender age of 19, she went on to model for Guess? jeans, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Paco Rabanne,  Yves Saint-Laurent, Chanel and Versace. So popular was she that in the early 1990s, she was one of the highest-paid fashion models in the world, attracting the affections of Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger. Despite modelling commitments, Bruni's energy is focused on her singing career and a world tour . Years later, her successes show no signs of abating. Carla, a former model turned chanteuse, is the current face of Bulgari and has appeared in several campaigns for the jewellery brand. Despite her modelling commitments, most of Bruni's energy is currently being directed at her singing career and a world tour that has already stopped off in Vienna, Berlin, Aix-en-Provence, New York, Quebec and Los Angeles. She has also been spending more time with her daughter Giulia, three, who was born while her husband Nicholas Sarkozy was still president of France. In fact, Sarkozy has been elected as head of the conservative party leaving him clear to launch a campaign to return as the country's leader in 2017. He was under pressure to win the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) leadership by a wide margin and received 64.5 per cent of the vote, well ahead of his nearest rival Bruno le Marie. This victory advances Mr Sarkozy's hopes of running in the presidential race, and cements his return to the political scene after losing to Francois Hollande more than two years ago.

"Prince Albert II of Monaco paid a visit to the hospital to visit his wife Princess Charlene and their new twins Prince Jacques Honore Ranier and Princess Gabriella Therese Marie. The babies were delivered at the Princess Grace hospital in Monaco, named after their late grandmother. Princess Gabriella was the first born baby, but her younger brother will inherit the Principality's throne. Scroll down for video . Prince Albert II, pictured left,  visited his wife and their two children earlier this afternoon in hospital . The Prince waved at crowds outside the Princess Grace Hospital in Monaco, named after his late mother . The Prince, right, and Princess Charlene, left, were married in 2011, eleven years after they had first met . The Royal Palace was illuminated in red and white, pictured,  to celebrate the arrival of the baby twins . Each of the twins received their own 21 cannon shots after the official announcement. Prince Albert said: 'I wish to share this moment of happiness with the Monegasque people and more widely with all my country's residents. It is understood that Princess Charlene will remain in hospital until Monday having delivered the twins by caesarean section. Last night's announcement saw hundreds of people take to the streets, waving their flags in jubilation, and beaming as 42 cannon shots rang out around the city. The official announcement of the birth came this morning, with two placards, one in French and one in English, hung on the outer wall of the flag-festooned Palais Princier by a battalion of carabinieres. Official announcement: The Palais Princier officially announced the birth this morning via a placard affixed to the wall . Solemn: The statement spoke of Prince Albert and Princess Charlene's delight at the birth of the royal twins . Formal: Two placards, one in French and one in English, were used to announce the royal birth . Jubilant: News of the birth was met with scenes of jubilation in the principality, the second smallest independent country in the world . Royal salute: The babies' arrival was also celebrated with a royal salute from a battalion of carabinieres . The statement read: 'It is with immense joy that TT.SS.HH the prince and princess of Monaco have the great pleasure to announce the birth of their children named: Gabriella, Thérèse, Marie (born at 17h04) Jacques, Honoré, Rainier (born at 17h06).' Babies Gabriella and Jaques arrived within minutes of each other last night, with the little girl born first at 5.04pm and her brother following two minutes later at 5.06pm. Despite being the younger, it will be Prince Jacques who succeeds his father on the throne, thanks to Monaco's continued embrace of Salic Law which states that male heirs always take precedence over their older sisters. She will, however, get a title, becoming the Countess of Carlades, while Crown Prince Jacques will get the traditional style of Marquis of Baux - a name always given to the first born son. The children, who are the first for 36-year-old Princess Charlene, were delivered at the Princess Grace Hospital - named after their late grandmother - where members of the media are currently gathering as they await the babies' first public appearance. Recovering: Princess Charlene, who was last seen on Monaco's National Day in November, is recovering in hospital after the birth . Respect: The placing of the placards was followed by a salute from the Carabinieres - watched by a crowd of photographers . Thrilled: Monaco's citizens and residents have spoken of their delight following the birth of the twin heirs . Assured: The birth of two children means Monaco's future is assured, with Prince Jacques set to succeed his father . Excitement: It isn't only  Monaco's residents who are thrilled - news of the birth brought messages of congratulations from around the world . While they wait, residents of Monaco are celebrating by covering everything - including homes and yachts - in national flags, which will remain in place until the babies are formally presented to the public from the balcony of the Palais Princier. For Fabienne Guenoune, president of the Le Rocher residents' association, 'the 42 cannon shots announcing the birth seals more than ever the future of the country'. 'A boy and a girl, it's the wish of a king,' added Michele Mattoni, another resident of The Rock, as Monaco is also known. 'This is an explosion of joy for all Monegasques,' said Marguerite-Marie Bergonzi, who comes from one of the oldest families in the world's second smallest independent state. Charlene, who is said to be doing well, gave birth by caesarian section and is likely to remain in hospital for at least another four days as she recovers from the birth. Her husband Prince Albert remains by her side and was there when she gave birth to the babies, which replace their aunt Caroline as heirs to the throne. Standing to attention: Carabinieres stand guard outside the Palais Princier in Monaco this morning . Festooned: The front of the Palais Princier was awash with national flags, hung to celebrate the birth . Colourful: Yachts in the marina were also given the flags treatment and provided a colourful sight . Jubilant: Last night saw ecstatic locals take to the streets to celebrate after the royal birth was announced . Overjoyed: Residents took to the streets after hearing the 42 cannon shots that heralded the twins' birth . Excited: The babies will be officially presented to the populace on the balcony of the Palais Princier once they leave hospital . Although females are not allowed to inherit under Salic Law,  the late Prince Rainier III rewrote the constitution after becoming ill in 2002 to make it possible for one of his daughters to inherit if his son - who has two illegitimate children - failed to produce a legitimate heir. That all changed after Albert, 56, married former Olympic swimmer Charlene, 36, in 2011 - 11 years after the pair first met. Early this year, the couple finally announced they were expecting after a three-year wait. The gender of the twins had been kept a secret during Charlene's pregnancy, including from their father who said last month that he was looking forward to being surprised. During the same interview, he also made plain that should the twins turn out to be a boy and a girl, it would be the boy who succeeded him, regardless of birth order. Albert, who was once considered one of the world's most eligible bachelors, succeeded his father Prince Rainier in 2005 at the age of 47. He already had a daughter, Jazmin, 22, after a fling with former waitress Tamara Rotolo. He denied being her father for years before DNA tests proved otherwise when she was a teenager. The prince also has a younger son, Alexandre Coste, 11, from an affair with Nicole Coste, a Togolese former Air France hostess. Under Monaco's inheritance laws, neither of them have any claim to royal titles or to be considered as heirs to Albert because they were born outside of marriage. They do however have legal rights to a share of his huge personal fortune, estimated by Forbes magazine to exceed $1 billion (800 million euros). Colourful: Red and white Monagasque flags hang from every window at the Palais Princier . Quick fix: A member of Palais staff adds to the already vast collection of celebratory flags . Need some help? The man gets a little help from one of the maids as he struggles with the banner . Almost there: With the flag in place, he finally manages to complete the job . Boom! The first of a series of cannon shots announcing the royal birth is fired over the Mediterranean last night . And again! The blast lights up the city skyline - including one impressively large yacht moored in the marina below . Tradition: Royal births are usually announced with 21 cannon blasts but because there are two babies, 42 cannon blasts were fired .

"A baby  died of Legionnaires’ disease just weeks after being born at home in a heated birthing pool, according a study published this month. The deadly form of pneumonia is caused by legionella bacteria which thrive in warm water in places such as hot tubs. While the baby’s death is the first case in the U.S. linked to a water birth, similar cases have been recorded in the UK and France. There may have been more non-fatal cases that have not been reported. The baby's death in January this year in Texas highlights the dangers of waterborne pathogens in water births at home. With the popularity of water births increasing, expectant mothers need to be aware of the risks of waterborne pathogens such as Legionnaires' disease  (stock image) An investigation was carried out by the Texas Department of State Health Services in a new report published in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. Severe infections caused by legionella are not common, but they do hospitalize 8,000 to 18,000 Americans each year according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However infants have a particularly high risk of developing severe complications if they are infected, and that makes heated birthing pools a specific problem given the under-developed immune systems of newborns. The Texas case outlined in the report, revealed the six-day old infant was rushed to a local pediatric hospital with breathing difficulties and other signs of infection, including sepsis. Tests revealed the presence of legionella, suspected by doctors due to the baby’s exposure to heated water at birth. After 19 days in hospital, the baby died. Legionnaires' disease is typically spread through poorly maintained water pipes or air conditioning systems. Two weeks before the due-date, a licensed midwifery center had delivered a collapsible hot tub to the home and filled it with water from a private borehole well. Commercially available water-purifying enzyme drops, that do not contain chlorine, were added to the water. The well water had not recently been chemically treated, and circulated in the tub at approximately 98.6°F until two days before the birth at which point it was drained, re-filled with well water, and reheated. The mother had had a healthy pregnancy and there were no complications at the midwife-assisted birth. After delivery, the mother and baby moved to the home’s bathtub which had been filled with water from the same source. Texas public health officials carried out tests on the hot tub and the well used to fill it, both of which came back negative, though the midwifery center had already cleaned, disinfected and stored the tub before it could be tested. Investigators also reviewed the disinfecting process the center carries out. Given potential inaccuracies in the testing process and because the tub had already been stored, researchers still believe that the baby was infected by water in the tub at birth. ‘Because Legionella is pretty ubiquitous in the environment, it's not a big stretch to imagine that it would be in the water system, and there were no other exposures that were identified,’ noted co-author of the report into legionella infections, Elyse Fritschel, an epidemiologist at Texas Department of State Health Services. Legionnaires' disease was first identified at a 1976 meeting of the American Legion Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, when many delegates fell ill. The legionella bacterium was found to be breeding in the cooling tower the convention venue. · Legionella bacteria can cause Legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac fever . · Named after a 1976 outbreak, when delegates at a Philadelphia convention of the American Legion fell ill . · The Bacteria are found naturally, usually in warm water . · Not transmitted from person to person . · Contracted by breathing in a mist or vapor that has been contaminated . · Keeping the bacteria out of water prevents infection . · Most people will develop pneumonia as the bacteria thrive in the lungs . · An estimated 8,000 to 18,000 people are hospitalized with Legionnaires' disease each year in the U.S. Researchers said that death of the Texas baby illustrates the wider risks of waterborne pathogens to babies born in water, as well as the need for more awareness of infections and standardized cleaning procedures. There are fears of a wider problem of infant infection as the popularity of water births increases as mothers report the water helps with pain and stress relief. Supermodel Gisele Bundchen opted for a water birth in 2010 when she delivered her son. Many other expectant mothers opt for water in the initial stages of labor, rather than at the delivery. Neither the American Academy of Pediatrics nor the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend water births. A recent joint report by the two organizations stated that there are no proven benefits to a water birth and there are heightened potential risks to the baby. The Texas Department of State Health Services at Arlington, Texas, investigated the January 2014 death of a home water-birthed infant that contracted Legionnaires' disease .","The Texas baby died at less than one month old after contracting Legionnaires' disease from a heated home-birthing pool .

"The Duchess of Cornwall served up sausages and mash at a tea party for children with terminal illnesses today. Camilla refused to stand on ceremony as she rolled up her sleeves and handed round plates to the youngsters, who were visiting her official London home, Clarence House. Each year the Duchess invites 12 young people and their families from the Helen & Douglas House, of which she has been patron since 2007, to help her decorate the royal Christmas tree. Magical: The Duchess of Cornwall threw a party at Clarence House for a group of terminally ill children . The Helen & Douglas House is an Oxford-based hospice that cares for terminally ill children, young adults and their families. It provides medical, emotional and practical support, helping families deal with implications of living with a child who will die prematurely, so that they can make the most of their time together. Opened in 1982, it was the world's first children's hospice and cares for children from birth to 16 years old. Sporting a pretty fuchsia dress and matching patterned scarf, Camilla chatted to each of the children and their families and heard their often heartbreaking stories. Among them were Andrew and Kay Lyon from Oxford and their daughter, Sienna, three, who suffers from a rare genetic condition that affects her brain. Tasty: Camilla served the children and their families a lunch of sausage and mash . Excited: The children and their families had travelled from an Oxford hospice to be at the party . Adorable: One little girl was overwhelmed with excitement as she was introduced to the Duchess . Who's next? The Duchess and a member of staff work out who is next in line for lunch . The couple told the Duchess of the support the charity has given them, even looking after Sienna, who suffers from regular seizures and is unable to walk or talk, while they took their older two children on holiday. 'Helen House has been remarkable and the care they give Sienna just unparalleled,' said Mrs Lyon during the event. 'The last three years have been filled with so much gipsies and sadness. It is something we never expected and has opened up a whole new life for us. 'We don't know how long we will have Sienna with us so this is about up helping us to create some very happy and special memories. Today has been huge part of that.' Afterwards, the Duchess opened the doors to her drawing room, behind which her assistant equerry from the Welsh Guards, Captain Fred Lloyd George, was waiting to salute the children. Delighted: The children, all of whom are terminally ill, were left smiling following their encounter . Big moment: Camilla's assistant equerry Captain Fred Lloyd George was on hand to salute the children . Decorations: Each of the youngsters was invited to place a decoration on the Clarence House tree . All smiles: A beaming Camilla told the children that the party was her favourite event of the year . Camilla then helped each child to choose several decorations and carefully placed them on the twinkling tree. Afterwards it was time for tea, which included sausages and mash, as well as chocolate Christmas trees and beautifully decorated biscuits. It's lovely to see you all and I hope you have enjoyed yourselves,' said Camilla as her guests finished their meal. 'This is one of my favourite things to do each year and seeing your faces as the door opens is magical. Helen & Douglas House is a wonderful, uplifting place. Everyone should visit it.' Camilla also comforted Marie McVicar from Wiltshire who tragically lost her son, Ollie Samways, seven, as a result of complication from pre-exciting brain damage, at the beginning of November. Ollie's sister, Shayla, four, put his decoration on the tree instead. Marie, who is pregnant with a baby boy, due in February, said: 'Ollie sadly died at the hospice from a chest infection last month and I would do anything to support them. They have become my family. 'Ollie was a very special little boy and met the Duchess when she visited the hospice earlier this year. She remembered him immediately and was a huge comfort.' Clare Edwards, chief operating officer at Helen and Douglas House, described the event as 'magical'. 'It's such a unique day, so special,' she said. 'It makes the children feel so worthy and special and important. 'It's a real privilege to have the Duchess as our patron. She take such an interest in the work we do and her patronage helps to shine a light on children's palliative care.' Pretty: Each of the children was allowed to choose several ornaments to hang on the tree . Traditional: Most had a traditional theme and were hung by the Duchess as well as the children .

"The Canadian killer who horrifically murdered and dismembered a Chinese student in Montreal planned the attack for six months and then worked to cover up the crime, prosecutors said Wednesday in closing arguments. Authorities worked to refute claims by Luka Magnotta's defense lawyer that he is mentally ill and not criminally responsible for the May 2012 murder of Jun Lin, 33. In a December 2011 email to a British journalist , Magnotta had boasted about killing another person and filming it. Prosecutors argued that this shows he was planning the crime for at least six months prior to carrying it out. New look: Luka Magnotta sports a mustache and a lot of extra weight as he sits in the dock at his trial in Montreal on Wednesday . Magnotta, pictured here after his 2012 arrest, worked as a gay escort in Montreal before he went on the run and was arrested in Berlin . Magnotta appeared in front of jurors heavyset, with a mustache and close-cropped hair, cutting a starkly different from the slender gay escort who was arrested in Berlin after going on the run two and a half years ago. The 32-year-old has admitted to killing engineering . student Jun Lin, 33, defiling the corpse, videotaping the acts and mailing parts of the body to elementary schools and . political parties in Canada's capital. On Wednesday, Magnotta's lawyer had argued his client has a . long medical history of schizophrenia and should not be held criminally accountable for his actions. But in his closing argument, prosecutor Louis Bouthillier . said Lin, who had no family in Montreal and no known connection . to Magnotta, may have been the 'perfect victim' for Magnotta, a . gay escort who, in a December 2011 email to a British . journalist, had boasted about killing a human and filming the . act. 'In this email he said he was going to make a movie with a . human,' Bouthillier told the jury in French and in English. 'First degree murder is a planned and deliberate murder. It's . right there on this piece of paper.' Jun Lin was horrifically slaughtered by Magnotta in May 2012 . Diran Lin, Jun Lin's father, has pleaded in court that certain horrific evidence about his son's death not be shown to jurors and never be released to the public . Bouthillier pointed to surveillance footage from Magnotta's . gritty Montreal apartment building that showed him discarding . bags full of bloodied items during 16 trips to the garbage room . over a 48-hour period after Lin's death in May 2012. Describing him as 'ultra-organized,' Bouthillier questioned . why Magnotta would change his phone, dispose of his camera and . his laptop after Lin's death and discard the victim's torso . inside a locked suitcase. 'Is this consistent from someone who doesn't know right from . wrong?' he asked. 'Mr. Magnotta, supposedly psychotic, . supposedly doesn't know from right and wrong, looks pretty . purposeful, pretty organized.' After the killing, Magnotta sent body parts to two . elementary schools in Vancouver and to two political parties in . Ottawa, wrapping the hands and feet in pink tissue paper and . including poems and notes. He then fled to Europe and was the subject of an . international manhunt. He was arrested in a Berlin Internet . cafe, where he was reading about himself. If Magnotta is found not criminally responsible, he faces an . indefinite sentence in a mental institution. If he is convicted, . he would get an automatic life sentence with no possibility of . parole for 25 years.","Luka Magnotta's lawyers argue that he's mentally ill and not criminally responsible for the May 2012 murder of Chinese student Jun Lin .

"On trial: Oskar Groening, now 92, pictured in his S.S. uniform when he served in Auschwitz, has been deemed fit to stand trial for his role as an accomplice to mass murder at the camp . A former Auschwitz guard has been deemed fit to stand trial for his role as an accomplice to mass murder at the extermination camp where the Nazis put 1.1 million people to death during the Second World War. As a S.S. sergeant, Oskar Groening was responsible for guarding the possessions of the doomed arrivals as they stepped off the trains bringing them to the camp in occupied Poland. He was never punished after the war for his service in Auschwitz - and claims he committed no crimes at the complex. But now aged 92, prosecutors in Hanover, Germany, have closed their preliminary investigation against him and have judged him fit to stand trial, according to German media. Groening is one of three men being investigated, but it is understood that two other elderly guards from the state of Lower Saxony are too frail to go on trial. 'The examination of the health status and the ability to negotiate a trial of the three accused is largely completed,' said senior state prosecutor, Thomas Klinge. Groening worked in the Auschwitz for more than two-and-a-half years, and has lived a comfortable life ever since near the Lueneburg Heath in Lower Saxony. Ironically, the Lueneburg Heath is the place where S.S. chief Heinrich Himmler was buried in an unmarked grave after committing suicide when he fell into British hands at the end of the war. Now, Groening has appointed a lawyer who has received notification that the authorities are proceeding against him, according to popular daily newspaper BILD. The former guard has previously spoken at trials after the war of the operations of the gas chambers and crematoria, but has denied any involvement. In 1948, a tribunal cleared him of war crimes and he began working as the manager of a glass factory. Notorious: Groening was responsible for guarding the possessions of the doomed arrivals as they stepped off the trains bringing them to Auschwitz (pictured) in Poland. He claims he committed no crimes at the complex . Atrocity: Now 92, prosecutors in Germany have closed their preliminary investigation against Groening and have judged him fit to stand trial, Above, children stand behind a barbed wire fence at the extermination camp . But as he has revealed in an interview, he has never quite recovered from his experiences at the notorious extermination camp. 'Every night and every day I remember it for the nightmare it was,' he said in an interview. 'It was in 1942 that my SS chiefs in Berlin ordered me there. 'I was an official in the prisoners' possessions administration which basically involved removing the money, jewels and other valuables from the inmates, registering it and sending it back to Berlin. 'They had diamonds and gold worth millions and it was my duty to make sure all of it got to Berlin. 'It was completely understood by all that the majority were going straight to the gas chamber, although some believed they were only going to be showered before going to work. Many Jews knew they were going to die.' Groening said memories of the camp occupied his 'every waking moment' - adding: 'I will never be free of them'. 'One time a drunken SS man discovered a crying baby on the platform, he said. 'He grabbed the waif by its legs and smashed its head against the side of a truck. My blood froze when I saw it. 'When I saw this I went to my superior officers and made an application for a transfer to the front, to anywhere. But he refused. Down the years I have heard the cries of the dead in my dreams and in every waking moment. I will never be free of them. 'It was becoming harder and harder to suppress everything I saw. On one night in January 1943 I saw for the first time how the Jews were actually gassed.  It was in a half-built farmyard near to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. A gas chamber was built there. We were searching the wood nearby for prisoners who had escaped. Left behind: Groening said memories of the camp occupied his 'every waking moment'. Above, victims' shoes . 'There were more than 100 prisoners and soon there were panic-filled cries as they were herded into the chamber and the door was shut. 'Then a sergeant with a gas mask went to a hole in the wall and from a tin shook Zyklon B gas pellets inside. In that moment the cries of the people inside rose to a crescendo, a choir of madness. These cries I have ringing in my ears to this day. 'I again made an application for a transfer and at the end of October 1944 I was shipped to the Belgian Ardennes where I served with a fighting unit until capture.' Since the war, Groening admitted he has been driven back to Auschwitz because of his 'shame'. 'This guilt will never leave me. I can only plead for forgiveness and pray for atonement,' he said. Kurt Schrimm, who heads the specialised unit in Germany responsible for tracking down Nazi war criminals, said the unit was currently investigating other S.S. guards who served at Auschwitz. 'We are also looking systematically at guards who served at the Majdanek death camp,' he said. 'I reckon we will give the files over to the relevant prosecutors in the first cases this year.' The conviction of former Sobibor extermination camp guard Ivan Demjanjuk in 2011 has paved the way for this last push to bring old Nazis to justice. Demjanjuk, who died in 2012, was sentenced to five years in prison for taking part in the murders of over 28,000 Dutch Jews in the camp in 1943. There were no witnesses and no evidence about what his role was in the camp, but justices decided that it was enough that he was there and, therefore, part of the murder machine.","Oskar Groening, 92, was S.S. sergeant at Auschwitz during World War Two .

"This is the horrifying moment Greek shipping heiress Athina Onassis suffered a fall in a major showjumping event. She was halfway through her qualifying competition when she and her white mare came crashing to the ground as they tackled one of the fences. Miss Onassis, who is 30 next month, escaped unharmed despite landing face down. But her horse, Ad Camille Z-Zang, was so badly injured that it had to be put down. Scroll down for video . Down: The 29-year-old heiress was riding her 11-year-old white mare, Ad Camille Z-Zang, when she took the tumble (pictured) Just before the fall and devastation afterwards: Athina is the only living descendant of Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis . A crane was used to remove its body from the showring of the 54th CHI International Showjumping Tournament in Geneva as its distraught rider watched. Miss Onassis is the last living descendant of Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, who died in 1975 aged 69. She is the only child of Christina Onassis, the magnate’s late daughter by his first wife; he subsequently married President John F Kennedy’s widow Jackie. Upon Aristotle’s death Athina inherited 55 per cent of his fortune, believed to be worth billions. Heartbreaking: According to French newspaper Le Matin, Anthina appeared to be 'unharmed' but her horse was 'severely injured' and had to be removed from the track using a crane . Tumble: Athina seemingly rolled free from her horse after hitting the ground . But she has shrugged off her family’s fame and lives a quiet life in Brazil’s largest city Sao Paulo with her husband, the Brazilian rider Alvaro de Miranda Neto, 41. She has dedicated herself to carving out an equestrian career. In 2012, she fell from an unnamed horse and sustained a spinal injury which took her out of the sport for more than a year. Miss Onassis, who competes for Greece, is rarely seen in public but has made an unusually large number of appearances in recent months as her showjumping career hots up. She last competed with Z-Zang on December 7 at the Gucci Paris Masters in France and before that at an event in Barcelona, coming a disappointing 57th.

"A former Texas beauty queen who spent upwards of $500,000 building the 'world's biggest closet' has put the expansive three-story space up for sale, along with the rest of her sprawling $12.9 million mansion. Just four months after her walk-in closet was robbed of an estimated $1 million worth of luxury goods, socialite Theresa Roemer, from Houston, Texas, has revealed that she is ready to leave the one-of-a-kind space behind in favor of building an even larger wardrobe space in her new home. '[Theresa's position is that] you can never have a big enough closet,' Ms Roemer's spokesperson told Curbed, while admitting that her client is seriously considering doubling her current 3,000 sq ft closet size. Scroll down for video . Double up: Theresa Roemer's publicist admitted that she is considering building a new closet that will be twice the size of the original . The lap of luxury: Ms Roemer's expansive closet boasts 3,000 sq ft of space . Making some serious money: The closet's renovations have cost an estimated $500,000 . The fitness guru, who first made her fortune after opening a chain of luxury gyms, admitted earlier this year that her spacious wardrobe had just continued to get bigger and bigger and confessed that there was no real limit to its expansion. 'It started years ago when I had a closet party and all the girls came over and they said, ""I just wish it was bigger,""' she told the Houston Chronicle 'Since then it's just been getting bigger and bigger and bigger, it's like a ""she cave.""' In August, Ms Roemer's closet-turned-cave hit the headlines after a burglar broke into the space and stole a selection of her most expensive accessories, handbags and jewelry, including a priceless locket which contains a piece of her late son's hair. Since the robbery, which took place while her home was undergoing renovations, MsRoemer has increased the property's security substantially and will no doubt be hoping that the widely-publicized incident does not have a negative impact on its sale. Fashion favorites: The former beauty queen had several irreplaceable items stolen from the three-story space earlier this year . 'This closet was built for fundraising': Despite the robbery, Ms Roemer previously insisted that she was determined to use her wardrobe as a means of raising money for charity . Pricey property: The couple look set to earn a small fortune from the sale of their luxurious home . Even if she and husband Lamar fail to find a buyer willing to pay the asking price, the couple look set to make an impressive profit on the property, which they reportedly purchased for just $2.5 million in July last year. Their decision to sell may come as a surprise to some however, particularly after Ms Roemer insisted just one month ago that the burglary would not prevent her - and various members of the public - from enjoying the use of her closet, which has often served as the venue for Ms Roemer's charitable fundraisers.

"The former attorney who allegedly drove over six Christmas shoppers in midtown Manhattan on Wednesday night had a crack pipe on the floor of her car and another in the trunk, a report claims. Stella Mednik, 34, was charged with DUI, fleeing the scene of an incident, and driving on a suspended license after her Mustang convertible crashed into oncoming traffic then careered into a group of pedestrians, who all remain in hospital in a serious condition. The crash came just three years after Mednik, a Brooklyn Law School graduate, had her legal license suspended for two years following a dispute over misplaced funds. Scroll down for video .

Six people have been seriously hurt after an alleged drunk driver jumped a curb in a busy midtown Manhattan shopping district and struck a group of Christmas shoppers on the sidewalk . It has since emerged that police have allegedly charged Mednik with possession of an illegal substance after an investigation at the scene uncovered drug paraphernalia, NBC reported.

She adds: 'I maybe a sarcastic bitch on this site but i Love people and get them results.' But in 2011, a New York court found she had failed to report payments made to her personal account from her office. According to the New York Daily News, Mednik was under arrest in New York's Bellevue Hospital on Thursday morning, where tests found she was over the legal blood alcohol limit. It is claimed she is being treated for a broken pelvis, while one crash victim suffered a broken leg.

There are unconfirmed reports that the smash, just yards from Macy's flagship store, left a small girl pinned under the car. Witness Matty Thomas, speaking to the NY Daily News, said: 'There were four bodies in the air. There was a lady who got hit as [the car] went through the glass window. 'Her body was in the display case and her legs were under the car. She was bleeding all from the side of her head. They had to saw her out of the car.

Teagan Batstone was found dead after police were called to a vehicle that had rolled into a ditch in Surrey, British Columbia, on Wednesday. Lisa Batstone was arrested a day later and appeared in court on Thursday facing second-degree murder charges in the death of her only child.

"Rosendo Torres pictured in his police mugshot . A former New York Yankees outfielder who worked as a youth baseball coach was sentenced today to three years in prison for sexually abusing an 8-year-old girl during baseball practice. Rosendo 'Rusty' Torres, 66, was convicted in July of five counts of first-degree sexual abuse. He was acquitted of sexually abusing another girl. Torres later tried to have the conviction overturned, claiming some jurors failed to disclose that they or family members had been crime victims or had been sexually victimized. Nassau County Court Judge Tammy Robbins rejected the argument that jurors acted improperly. 'As a professional athlete, people looked up to this defendant and trusted him to teach America's favorite pastime to their children,' District Attorney Kathleen Rice said in a statement. 'Instead, he violated that trust and committed horrible acts against a defenseless young girl.' Prosecutors said the girl was abused by Torres while he worked as a coach for the Long Island town of Oyster Bay. The abuse occurred from April 2012 to May 2012 during baseball practice sessions in Plainview, prosecutors said. A town spokesman did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Robbins said Torres never apologized or acknowledged the little girl. Defense attorney Troy Smith said Torres 'has maintained his innocence and still maintains his innocence to this day.' The Massapequa resident played 89 games for the Yankees in 1971-72. He also played for four other teams. He had a .212 lifetime batting average before retiring in 1980.

"A teenager has been found guilty of murdering a 15-year-old schoolmate, who he sexually assaulted and stabbed with a screwdriver so that he could sell his soul to the devil. Jose Reyes, 18, was found guilty of capital murder by a jury in Harris County, Texas on Thursday afternoon and will automatically be sentenced to life in prison. Due to his age at the time of the alleged crime - 17 - he was not eligible for the death penalty. He was accused of killing a 15-year-old schoolmate, Corriann Cervantes, with another male friend, Victor Alas, in an empty apartment in Clear Lake, Texas on February 4. The girl was lured to the apartment by the duo but, after agreeing to have sex with them, she was allegedly strangled, bludgeoned and stabbed - and even had one of her eyes gouged out by the boys at part of a satanic ritual. In court: Jose Reyes, 18, is pictured in court on Monday, charged with the capital murder of a 15-year-old girl who was found bludgeoned and strangled to death at an abandoned apartment in February . Details of the case were so graphic that members of the jury wept during opening statements on Monday. On Wednesday, the jury members were shown graphic autopsy pictures of the girl. The Houston Chronicle reported that the images showed the right side of her face caved in after she was hit across the head with the porcelain lid of a toilet tank after she tried to run away. 'There were pieces of porcelain embedded in her face,' Assistant Harris County District Attorney John Jordan told jurors. One of the girl's eyes were also gouged out with a plastic rod used to adjust window blinds, the Chronicle reported. The photos were only seen by the jury, but some items, including the screwdriver Reyes allegedly stabbed her with, were on display in the courtroom 'and made some in the courtroom visibly upset', KHOU reported. It came after testimony showed that Cervantes and the two boys left a party where they were drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana and taking prescription pills to have sex. Victim: Corriann Cervantes was found half naked with her clothes torn. Her body showed signs that she had been violently raped and there was an upside down cross carved into her flesh . Scene: Authorities say that after the boys lured Cervantes to a vacant apartment in southeast Houston (pictured) on February 5, they hit her with an ashtray, a toilet tank lid and a window blind rod . A witness said that the boys were holding up the girl as they left the party. As the three had sex in the abandoned apartment, Alas began strangling her with a belt and Reyes stabbed with a screwdriver dozens of times in the face and torso. Prosecutors say the two boys were hoping to make a deal with the devil when they disfigured the girl's body, including gouging one eye and carving an upside down crucifix on her stomach. Reyes reportedly confessed to the horrific crime and said he had killed Corriann so that his younger friend could 'sell his soul to the devil,' according to KTRK-TV. 'Whether or not the devil was involved, what happened in that apartment was sadistic and inhumane,' Mr Jordan said. 'He said he had no regrets.' Haunting: Jose Reyes (pictured left in court and right in his mug shot) was charged as an adult in the heinous crime even though he was just 17 at the time. He will now be sentenced to life in prison . On trial: Reyes, in court on Monday, was turned in by his parents after he made 'some admissions' to them . Corriann was found in the empty flat three days after she was kidnapped. One of the neighbors who found her body said there were religious items placed around her. A police report says she was found half naked with her clothes torn. Her body showed signs that she had been violently raped. 'What happened in that vacant apartment was sadistic. What will eventually happen in the... courtroom will be justice,' Mr Jordan had said during the trial. He added that Reyes' family went to authorities after the teenager made 'some admissions' to them about what had happened. 'They did the right thing. Clearly they were offended by his conduct,' he said. At Reyes' home, 'there were some signs of devil worship and things of that nature,' Mr Jordan said. Sick: Reyes confessed that the pair sexually assaulted Corriann. The duo allegedly strangled her with a belt, stabbed her repeatedly with a screwdriver and gouged out on of her eyes in the horrific attack . His former girlfriend, and the mother of his child, who was born in May 2013, also testified during the trial that she feared for his life when he spoke about the brutal killing. Agapita Gonzales, who ived with Reyes and his family until she stopped seeing him romantically in February, told the court that she overheard him talking with his sister about an assault. 'I just remember him talking about killing her,' Gonzales said. 'Corriann Cervantes.' Prosecutors and the defense rested on Thursday and the jury returned with the verdict. Alas also faces a capital murder charge as a juvenile.","Jose Reyes, 18, will automatically be sentenced to life in prison for the killing of Corriann Cervantes, 15, in a satanic ritual in February .

"A Florida couple was arrested this week after using forged documents to back up their fraudulent claim to a million dollar home where they squatted with nothing but a pool table for furniture, police say. Justin, 24, and Jenna Dean, 23, allegedly moved into a 7,000-square-foot home in Keystone Heights, Florida after claiming they'd purchased the foreclosed property for $1,000. Police caught wind of the Deans' dishonest digs in September, police say, after another couple lawfully purchased the home for $1.1million and found it already occupied. Nabbed: Jenna, 23, and Justin Dean, 24, were arrested December 8 after police say they forged bank documents in order to squat illegally in a foreclosed $1million Keystone Heights, Florida home . Bad timing: The home had been foreclosed sine 2011, and the Deans may have gotten away with the fraud for longer, police say, but they happened to move in less than a month before an Ohio couple finally decided to buy the home legitimately . Clay County police say the couple removed the home's existing locks and replaced them with their own when they moved in, First Coast News reports. Authorities say the young couple, who'd recently had a baby, then began to boast about their property on Facebook, where they posted photos of themselves in the pool. 'There were pictures of them in the pool on social media,' said Clay County deputy Steven Dugger told FCN. 'The only furniture in the house was a pool table.' Investigators say Jenna wrote on her Facebook: . 'This is the house we just bought. We have a lot of work to do, it'll take some time but Rome wasn't built overnight.' When a friend of the couple's admired their palatial new pad on Facebook and asked how they snagged such a find, Dean said it just takes time...and skill. 'Takes years of looking and harassing banks about their foreclosures,' Dean said, in a response dug up by Jacksonville.com. 'I should start my own business.' Sometime in September, the property manager removed the new locks and replaced them. However, they soon discovered the locks changed a second time. When the bank that owned the home told authorities the Deans did not own it, investigators showed up. The Deans graciously gave them a tour and showed them a cell phone photo of a quit claim deed -- a document used to transfer property from one party to another quickly but with little legal security. Not a care in the world: Police say the couple even snapped themselves enjoying the pool and posted the photo to Facebook . Not the sharpest: Police say the fraud was discovered after the home was purchased along with the 200 acres on which it sits. The Deans had allegedly changed the locks twice and even gave police a tour at one point after forwarding authorities a copy of their supposed deed--which police say was photoshopped together from forms with different fonts and bore a September 1 date--which was Labor Day, when banks were closed . 'Leaving the state': The couple had reportedly spent the last two years running a horse shoeing service called J.D. Farrier Services. A Facebook account for the business gave a suspicious and hurried farewell to customers on December 1,  just a week before the Deans turned themselves in . While the home had languished in foreclosure since 2011 unpurchased, the Deans chose the wrong time to pretend they bought it. Less than a month after their allegedly faked documents say the Deans bought the house, an Ohio couple bought it for real. Investigators looked into the Deans' deed and found they had forged both bank signatures and a notary seal, police say. 'The quit claim deed that was filed was fraudulent; it was made up of pieces of other deeds where the signatures were on the correct deed and used on the other deed,' Dugger told WJAX. Dugger also said the fonts on the assembled documents didn't even match. Justin and Jenna were turned themselves in to authorities on charges of December 8. Jacksonville.com reports that the couple had spent the last two years running a horse shoeing service called J.D. Farrier Services. A Facebook account for the business gave a suspicious and hurried farewell to customers just a week before the Deans turned themselves in. 'With great happiness and sadness, I will no longer being shoeing/trimming horses in Florida,' Justin Dean posted. 'I have a job offer out of state that I have accepted.' They've since been released on bond.","Justin and Jenna Dean faked documents to back up their fraudulent claim to a sprawling Keystone Heights, Florida home and its 200 acres, cops say .

"A sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin knew at once there was something fishy about John Pryzybyla's explanation for why he was reeking of alcohol. A criminal complaint filed in Adams County says the 75-year-old resident of Friendship told the deputy who stopped him that the reason he smelled like liquor is because he had been at a traditional Wisconsin fish fry and had eaten beer-battered fish. The complaint says the deputy had spotted Mr Przybyla driving with a broken taillight and making a U-turn on Highway 13 in Dell Prairie at around 2.30pm on October 12, followed his vehicle and discovered he had a revoked license. Something's fishy: When pulled over by a deputy in Wisconsin back in October, John Pryzybyla, 75, tried to explain away the smell of alcohol on his breath by saying he had just eaten beer-battered fish . Fish tale: The glassy-eyed driver told the arresting deputy he was returning home from a fish fry . The arresting deputy noted that the driver had bloodshot and glassy eyes, and that there was an open container of Red Dog beer in the passenger seat, CBS 58 reported. The traffic stop resulted in a DUI arrest - Pryzybyla's tenth in nearly two decades - after he failed a field sobriety test. Pryzybyla was then taken to Moundview Memorial Hospital for a blood test, which he refused to take claiming it was against his religion, according to Wisconsin Rapids Tribune. The arresting deputy was forced to obtain a warrant to compel Pryzybyla to take the test. Nurses at the hospital had to hold him down to draw blood. Long history: The traffic stop marked Pryzybyla's tenth arrest stemming from a suspected DUI offense . Crafty: The driver was taken to a hospital for a blood test, but told the staff it was against his religion . Although his blood alcohol content was determined to be at .062, which is below the legal limit, his history of DUI incidents bars him from getting behind the wheel with a blood alcohol content higher than .02. Pryzybyla has previous convictions in Milwaukee, Adams, and Columbia counties dating back to 1995. In 2011, he was sentenced to a year in jail and five years' probation. He is due back in court January 21 for a preliminary hearing.","John Pryzybyla, 75, was pulled over in Adams County, Wisconsin, in October after being spotted driving erratically .

"A French housewife found guilty of sexually abusing two plumbers who had visited her house to mend a leak today has apologised to the men. Identified only by her initials of I.D, the 50 year old said she was determined to turn over a new leaf and become a life coach. On Wednesday a court in Arras, northern France, found her guilty of abusing the men when they visited her flat in October last year. The 50-year-old French housewife made lewd suggestions to a pair of plumbers and rubbed up against their bottoms. When they resisted her advances she reacted furiously, smacking one of them across the face . Rather than allowing them to get on with their work, she forced herself against their bottoms when they were bending over, and made lewd suggestions. ‘When you have done with the radiators, come to my bed,’ was one of her suggestions, the court heard. The men were not interested in sex, but that did not stop the women closing the shutters of her flat and making further propositions. When shunned further, the woman smacked one of the men across the face, before throwing them both out of her home, Voix du Nord newspaper reported. In their panic, the men left their tools behind, leaving the police to retrieve them the next day. The woman, who had a serious alcohol problem, also attacked police officers. She was given a 12 month suspended prison sentence and told to seek treatment for her heavy drinking. I.D. told the court: ‘I’ve now decided to take my life in hand. I’ve not drunk for more than eight months, and I’ve started training to be a life coach.’ She added that she apologised to the two plumbers, and agreed to pay them the equivalent of around £800 in damages.","The 50-year-old made lewd suggestions after they arrived to repair a leak .

"Hollywood film producer Scott Rudin has apologized for comments he made in some of the many emails he wrote that have been leaked over the past few days as a result of the Sony hack. 'Private emails between friends and colleagues written in haste and without much thought or sensitivity, even when the content of them is meant to be in jest, can result in offense where none was intended,' said Rudin. 'I made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny, but in the cold light of day, they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive — and not funny at all. To anybody I’ve offended, I’m profoundly and deeply sorry, and I regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused.' Scroll down for video . My bad: Scott Rudein (above) has apologized for comments he made in leaked emails about President Barack Obama and Angelina Jolie . More emails: An email exchange between Amy Pascal (left) and Rudin (right) showed the two mocking the President's race . Bad timing: The emails were exchanged on the eve of a fundraiser attended by President Obama (above) at the home of DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg . The statement, released to Deadline, comes shortly after the most damning batch of emails were released, in which Rudin and Sony Pictures Chair Amy Pascal exchanged racist comments about President Barack Obama. Pascal also issued an apology on Thursday, saying; 'The content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am.' She then added, 'although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.' On the eve of a fundraising breakfast being attended by the President at the home of DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, Pascal and Rudin went over things she could discuss with Obama while at the event in October 2013. 'Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?' Pascal asks Rudin, a reference to the 2012 Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained that dealt with the subject of slavery in the antebellum South. '12 years,' responds Rudin, referencing another slavery film, this time Steve McQueen's 2013 Academy Award-winning work 12 Years a Slave, a very violent and brutal look at the injustice and abuse endured by the millions forced into slavery in America. The pair then keep going, listing as many current films starring black actors as they can name, including Lee Daniels' The Butler and two Kevin Hart movies, Think Like a Man and Ride Along. 'I bet he likes Kevin Hart,' says Rudin at one point. Racist response: Rudin suggests that Pascal maybe talk with the President about 12 Years a Slave (above) Not good: The email exchange also finds Rudin commenting that President Obama 'likes Kevin Hart' This all come just one day after Rudin called Angelina Jolie 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in emails discussing who would direct her upcoming remake of the classic film flop Cleopatra. Jolie had wanted the director David Fincher to helm the project, while Rudin wanted to use him on a Steve Jobs biopic he was developing. In the end, Fincher passed on both. Rudin previously gave a statement to the New York Times about the hack earlier this week. 'This is not about salacious emails being batted around by Gawker and Defamer,' the disgraced producer said on Wednesday. 'It’s about a criminal act, and the people behind it should be treated as nothing more nor less than criminals.' Burn: Rudin called Jolie (above with Pascal) a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' in one email . In demand: Jolie and Rudin both wanted to use David Fincher (above) on their film projects . In other leaked emails, these having to do with the Jobs biopic, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has some not so kind words for the man now set to star in the film, Michael Fassbender. 'I don't know who Michael Fassbender is and the rest of the world isn't going to care,' Sorkin tells Pascal when informed of the studio's desire to cast the actor, who also starred in 12 Years a Slave. One man who is clearly a fan of Fassbender however is producer Michael De Luca, who says of the Irish actor in one email, 'He just makes you feel bad to have normal-sized genitalia.' The emails formed part of the November 24 cyber attack on Sony Pictures. As for the fundraising event, which took place last November, President Obama did indeed talk about the film industry, saying: 'Believe it or not, entertainment is part of our American diplomacy. 'If they’re watching an old movie — Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,The Mary Tyler Moore Show, or Will and Grace and Modern Family — they’ve had a front-row seat to our march towards progress. Even if their own nations haven’t made that progress yet.' According to public records, Pascal donated $5,000 to President Obama's re-election campaign and gave a further $30,800 to the Democtratic National Committee. Obama made no mention of the films Django Unchained, 12 Years a Slave, Lee Daniels' The Butler, Think Like a Man or Ride Along in his speech at the event. Response: Hart posted his response to the emails on Instagram Thursday . Also on Thursday, Kevin Hart took to his Instagram to respond to an email conversation between Pascal and Clint Culpepper in which he was called a 'greedy whore' for demanding more money to promote on of his films on social media. 'Knowing your self worth is extremely important people,' wrote Hart.'I worked very hard to get where I am today. I look at myself as a brand and because of that I will never allow myself to be taking advantage of. I OWN MY BRAND…I MAKE SMART DECISIONS FOR MY BRAND….I PROTECT MY BRAND….which is why I’m able to brush ignorance off of my shoulder and continue to move forward.'","Scott Rudin has apologized for emails he sent that made racist comments about President Obama and said negative things about Angelina Jolie .
Sony Pictures Chair Amy Pascal also issued an apology, saying her comments were 'insensitive and inappropriate'
Rudin and Pascal mocked President Obama in a series of emails that were released on Thursday .
The pair implied that the President only liked movies with black actors and subject matter - such as Django Unchained and 12 Years A Slave .
Rudin is now saying that the comments were meant to be 'funny,' but he now realizes they are 'thoughtless and insensitive'
This comes one day after Rudin was revealed to have called Angelina Jolie a 'minimally talented brat' in one email ."
"The House pushed through a $1.1 trillion bill financing the government through September after President Barack Obama phoned Democratic lawmakers and urged them to back the measure on Thursday. The House approved the measure late Thursday by 219-206, hours before a midnight deadline to avoid a government shutdown. Although it must also pass the Senate and be signed into law, the White House has already agreed to support the bill. After the measure passed in a narrow vote, House Speaker John Boehner said with relief: 'Thank you and Merry Christmas.' Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama will sign the spending legislation offered up by House leadership if it passes Congress, the White House said today, in a blow to Democrats trying to bring the bill down . House Democrats had lined up on Thursday to blast the massive spending bill that keeps the government open through the end of the current fiscal year, with just hours left to prevent a shutdown. Liberals lambasted two provisions of the massive 1,600 page joint continuing resolution and omnibus bill - being referred to as the CRomnibus in Washington - that provided sweeteners for Wall Street and the wealthy and threatened to yank their support from final passage of the bill in a Thursday afternoon vote. Their last-minute push to block the legislation received a punch to the gut on Thursday afternoon when the White House came out in favor of the compromise package, but with just a few hours left to go, the president's team still hadn't wooed enough lawmakers, creating an opening for legislators unhappy with the final version of the bill. Throughout the first part of Thursday Democrats took to the House floor to voice their displeasure with a section that would weaken restrictions on financial derivatives and another that would increase the amount of money that individuals can donate to political parties ten-fold. Maryland Rep. John Sarbanes described the first as a 'Wall Street giveaway' and the second as way to allow Wall Street to flood the political system with more money. Referring to the way the bill was released late Tuesday evening just before Midnight, Sarbanes said, 'These two provisions bumped into each other somewhere in the middle of the night, in the corridors of Capitol Hill, up here. 'They bumped into each other, or maybe they were introduced and one of them said I'll be the quid, and the other one said I'll be the quo,' he said. 'I don't know which is which, but I know this is a quid pro qou, and it's the kind of quid pro qou that is corrupting the machinery of our government and is offensive to the American people.' Continuing, Sarbanes, said. 'We need to get rid of the quid, we need to eliminate the qou, from this bill, bring it back in a way that we can actually support it. That's what we need to do for the American people.' Earlier, Michigan Democrat Dan Kildee said he shared a Republican colleague's concern that voting the bill down would lead to a shutdown, as the continuing resolution the government is currently operating off of will sunset at Midnight. 'The question we need to ask ourselves in this body,' he said, 'is at what price do we keep government open?' Kildee said there's a lot of good in the legislation before the House. But 'the notion that a price has to be paid in order to keep government open and that price is to grant greater power to the wealthiest Americans to have more influence over our political process is just too much for me to take,' he said. A flabbergasted Kildee said he couldn't believe that of all the problems the House could use this opportunity to solve, such as increased funding for infrastructure or leveling the playing fielding for the less fortunate, it 'is deciding that the one thing we have to do is to make sure that the wealthiest Americans can now spend 10x more money on the political process than they did last year.' 'Seriously? This is a problem that we have to solve in order to keep government open? I just can't imagine,' he said. 'I just can't imagine that this is the price we have to pay.' Even as Democrats were threatening to shred the delicately crafted bipartisan bill, House Speaker John Boehner was telling reporters that he expected the bill to pass with votes from both Republicans and Democrats. 'It's a good bill, and I think it reflects the people's priorities,' he said at a Capitol Hill press conference on Thursday morning, later pointing out, 'Listen, if we don't get finished today, we're gonna be here until Christmas!' The House is scheduled to recess on Friday until early January, but a failure to pass a new continuing resolution would force Congress into staying through the weekend and potentially next week. Opposing sides: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi encouraged Democrats to vote down the bill - despite the president asking them to support it - while House Speaker John Boehner urged his colleagues to vote for it, lest they have to remain in Washington through the holiday season . Just minutes after Boehner's press conference a procedural vote allowing the bill to come to a full vote barely passed 214 - 212, as a group of conservative members held out their yes votes over fury that the bill did not include language prohibiting the Department of Homeland Security from implementing Obama's immigration orders. A vote on the final bill was to come later on Thursday, and was expected before close of business. Yet the House still hadn't voted as of early evening as the White House scrambled to whip votes. Just as liberals and conservatives thought they may have won a second chance at debating the appropriations legislation, the White House threw it's support behind the package as is on Thursday afternoon. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters at his daily briefing that Obama backs the compromise proposal and would sign it if it came to his desk. Earnest said Obama was particularly pleased that that the bill included $5.4 billion to fight the spread of Ebola and 'substantial funding at Obama’s request' for the fight against ISIS. He said Obama was also happy to learn that the continuing resolution and omnibus bill appropriated $750M for early childhood education and an 'appropriate level of funding' for climate change measures. In terms of what the bill does not do, he said it doesn't include major Wall Street reforms that Republicans have tried to slap onto spending legislation in the past as well as riders that would 'gut' the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation, Obamacare and the president's immigration actions. Earnest said Democrats 'should vote their conscience' while making it clear that the president believes the compromise bill is the best option. Meanwhile, House Minority Leader continued to encourage her caucus not to vote for the bill, sending them all a letter making it crystal clear what she expected of them. 'It is clear from this recess on the floor that the Republicans don't have enough votes to pass the CRomnibus. This increases our leverage to get two offensive provisions of the bill removed: the bank bailout and big money for campaigns provision,' she said. 'However you decide to vote in the end, I thank those who continue to give us leverage to improve the bill.'","Bill keeps the government open through the end of the current fiscal year; Congress had just hours to prevent a shut down .

"An eight-year-old British girl at the centre of family court proceedings has been unlawfully taken to the United States by her mother who has 'secretly' married an American man, lawyers claim. Jessica Monkman is thought to be living in Cincinnati, Ohio, with her mother Natalie Lewis, 36. The youngster's case has been analysed at private family court hearings in recent months but her father Nathan Lawrence, 35, says he has not seen her since March and is 'heartbroken'. Natalie Lewis (right| with her and Nathan Lawrence's daughter Jessica Monkman (left), posing for a picture with a copy of the Cincinnati Enquirer . A High Court judge has allowed media to name Jessica and Ms Lewis (pictured) in the hope publicity will encourage her to return to Britain with her daughter . A High Court judge has given reporters the go-ahead to disclose detail in the hope that publicity will encourage Ms Lewis to return to the UK with her daughter. Mr Justice Newton gave permission for the identities of Jessica, and her mother and father, who come from Erdington, Birmingham, to be disclosed at a private hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. Lawyers for Mr Lawrence said it was hoped 'public attention' would make Ms Lewis 'reconsider'. They said Jessica had been reported missing to West Midlands Police and police in Cincinnati were involved. Jessica's father Nathan Lawrence (pictured), from Birmingham, was left 'heartbroken' after his daughter and former partner vanished in March . Lawyer Pam Sanghera, who works for The Family Firm Solicitors in Birmingham, which represents Mr Lawrence, said Mr Lawrence and Ms Lewis had separated in 2010 after a 10-year relationship. Family court proceedings had begun and Mrs Sanghera said Ms Lewis had 'secretly' married an American man in the United States. Mr Lawrence feared that Ms Lewis would move to America with Jessica and Mrs Sanghera said a judge in Birmingham had ordered Ms Lewis not to remove Jessica from the UK without court permission. But in March Ms Lewis and Jessica had vanished. 'The mother had taken the child without goodbyes,' said Mrs Sanghera. 'She did not tell the school or provide a forwarding address. 'The father was helpless, distraught and panicked, fearing what his child was going through and whether he was ever going to see her again.' Mrs Sanghera said police had found Ms Lewis and Jessica in Cincinnati. Ms Lewis had agreed to take Jessica to a local police station so that 'safe and well' checks could be carried out. They had been photographed holding a copy of the Cincinnati Enquirer newspaper. Mrs Sanghera said Mr Justice Newton had ordered Ms Lewis to return Jessica to the UK in October, but to no avail. The judge gave permission for the case to be publicised at a hearing on Wednesday. 'She has made no effort whatsoever to attempt to comply,' said Mrs Sanghera. 'The father has not had any direct or indirect contact with the child since he last saw her in March.' She added: 'He is heartbroken.' Mrs Sanghera said Mr Lawrence hoped that publicity would encourage Ms Lewis to return Jessica rather than 'incur public opprobrium' and the 'disapproval of relatives'. 'The father believes that the mother's family and friends in the UK and the USA will place pressure on the mother to return to the UK with the child,' she added. 'The father hopes to attract public interest and support in both England and the USA. The father believes that public attention will make the mother reconsider.'","Jessica Monkman, 8, unlawfully taken to U.S. by her mother, lawyers claim .

"A former Utah English teacher accused of having sex with two students is facing additional charges after a third alleged victim has come forward. Brianne Altice, 35, a former teaching assistant at Davis High School in Kaysville, was arrested in October 2013 on suspicion of having sex with a 16-year-old boy. In August of this year, a second student came forward accusing Altice of carrying on a physical relationship with him as well. Scroll down for video . Accused: Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice stands before the judge during her first court hearing in January in Farmington, Utah, accused of having sexual relationships with three of her students . Now, the former educator who lost her job and saw her marriage break apart in the aftermath of the scandal has been charged with a total of 10 felony counts stemming from her alleged encounters with three minors. The charges against Altice include first-degree rape, first-degree forcible sodomy and second-degree forcible sexual abuse, reported The Salt Lake Tribune. The latest alleged victim to come forward about his illicit relationship with the former teacher told investigators he had sexual encounters with Altice between August and September 2013. Miss Altice is due back in court January 12 for a preliminary hearing to hear testimony from the third teenager. Altice’s attorney, Edward Brass, has said in court his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students. ‘It is her defense that they did not happen at all,’ Brass wrote in a motion. ‘That she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students ...’ Prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with the 16-year-old boy on two occasions. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. But Brass has asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial, arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home last October to interview her about the allegations. Altice, who was arrested in October for the alleged incidents involving the first student, now faces nine felony counts in connection with the allegations involving two of her former students . Brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children, call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her. 'Her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called Miranda rights,' Brass wrote in court papers. 'The evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement.' In September, one of the teenage boys, now 18, offered graphic details during his testimony about how he went from being Altice's student to allegedly having sex with her in his Farmington home. The teen testified that he was 17 years old when he became involved with Altice between April and June of last year, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. He said it began with kissing between class periods and eventually graduated to sexual intercourse. When asked to describe his relationship with Brianne Altice, the teenage boy said she was his 'teacher with benefits.' Altice has pleaded not guilty to all counts. Her attorney Ed Brass argued she did not use her position as a teacher to persuade the teen into having a sexual relationship. He said she succumbed to the student's frequent flirting. 'She repeatedly refused and declined his advances until he ultimately broke down her resistance,' Brass claimed, according to the Tribune. Under Utah law, a victim cannot consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust. Altice was fired from Davis High School in February, and her husband filed for divorce that was finalized in December. She remains free on $10,000 bail.","Brianne Altice faces 10 felony counts including rape, first-degree forcible sodomy and second-degree forcible sexual abuse .

However, experts have warned they could also be the next big target for hackers. A video reveals just how easy it is to read messages sent to a smartwatch running Google's Android software. Scroll down for video . For this proof-of-concept, a Nexus 4 Android phone equipped with Android L Developer Preview and Samsung Gear Live (pictured) were used - and hackers could read messages sent to the watch. For this proof-of-concept, a Nexus 4 Android device equipped with Android L Developer Preview and Samsung Gear Live were used. Using special software the team was able to 'brute force' a six digit passcode used to link the phone to the watch - and then read messages sent to it. 'Smartwatches, bands and devices all have a lack of security. 'We trust these devices with everything from messages and Facebook updates to biometric information,' said Liviu Arsene of Bitdefender, which uncovered the issue. 'Everything from SMS messages to Facebook or Google Hangouts chats are constantly being forwarded to your smartwatch.' He found that Google's Android Wear software relies on a six digit pin code to link to watches. 'This six digit pin code can be easily bruteforced,' he said. 'It was not all that that difficult to do.' 'Because the Android Wear obfuscation relies on a pin code of only six digits during the initial pairing, an attacker wouldn’t take long to brute-force number and start reading your conversations in plain-text,' he wrote. 'Of course, this means an attacker would have to be fairly near the victim and log all intercepted Bluetooth data packets, but the large-scale adoption of such an exploit could be fueled by the increasing number of smartwatches or smartbands. 'Weaponizing it could only be a matter of time.' For the proof-of-concept, a Nexus 4 Android device equipped with Android L Developer Preview and Samsung Gear Live were used. 'The implications of these recent findings are only moderately surprising – we know from past experience that adoption of new technologies does not always go hand-in-hand with better security practices.'

The firm showed off the latest watches running Android wear, a version of Android designed for wearable computers. 'It's finally possible to make a powerful computer small enough to wear on your body,' said Google's David Singleton. It showed off the LG G watch, which shows the users the most relevant alert at the time - for instance, a flight they are about to get or an upcoming meeting. Google also revealed apps for its watches, including a food ordering app from Eat that allows users to order favourite food directly from their wrist, and a recipe app called allthecooks that walks users through recipes on the watch face. Using special software the team was able to 'brute force' a six digit passcode used to link the phone to the watch - and then read messages sent to it. LG said the G Watch would initially be made available to 12 countries including the US, UK, France, Germany and Japan, adding that it would announce its price and shipping date shortly.

"Admission: Richard Dumas pleaded guilty on Thursday to two charges of theft . Former Phoenix Suns forward Richard Dumas has pleaded guilty to two counts of theft after being accused of stealing merchandise from a military base store. Maricopa County, Arizona prosecutors say the 45-year-old  entered his plea Thursday. He's scheduled to be sentenced January 20. Authorities say Dumas stole about $800 worth of merchandise from the Luke Air Force Base's exchange store while working with a janitorial service in 2012. They say Dumas was seen on surveillance cameras taking cigarettes, alcohol, food, DVDs and shoes. Dumas originally pleaded not guilty to eight felony charges of organized retail theft. Many of those charges were later dropped when he agreed to the plea deal. Dumas played for the Suns from 1992 to 1995 and helped the team reach the NBA Finals in 1993. He was waived by the team though after missing a drug test, and in 1998 he was arrested on cocaine charges. In the late 1990s, Dumas tried to resurrect his career by playing in Eastern Europe, but did not last long due to a knee injury. After retiring from basketball in 2003, Dumas started a charity program to mentor young athletes. He was arrested last year while working at the Richard Dumas and Friends Athletic Organization headquarters.

"Four missing young boys who were the subject of an Amber Alert issued by California Highway Patrol Wednesday night were rescued following a tense standoff with the children's father. The dramatic arrest capped three days of intense search efforts to locate Daniel and Erica Perez, of Montebello, California, and their four sons, ages 6 to 11. On an elevated overpass near the San Diego suburb of Santee, officers used two armored trucks to surround the vehicle. Daniel Perez, 43, from Montebello, was taken into custody nearly two hours after his 2014 black Toyota Camry was spotted at around 8.30am in a San Diego suburb. Scroll down for videos . Happy end: A police officer takes care of two boys after an Amber Alert vehicle was stopped on a freeway exit ramp in Santee, California December 11 .

The two kids had continued to be held hostage after their two brothers were let out of the car . Worst fear: Police feared Perez would try to leap from the overpass with one of the kids in tow . The hunt for Perez was prompted by the discovery of a dead woman in the trunk of a Honda Accord belonging to Perez and his wife, Erica, about a half-mile from their home Wednesday. The family had not been heard from since Friday, and neither spouse had been answering their phone. Relatives told police the couple's marriage was unstable and that there was a history of domestic violence. As of Thursday afternoon, the body of the woman in the trunk has not been positively identified as Mrs Perez. An official with the Los Angeles County coroner's office said no details could be released because the case is on a security hold by Montebello police. CHP officers had spent the night searching for Daniel Perez until a LoJack system installed in his Toyota led them to the wanted man in El Cajon at 8.30am, according to CBS Los Angeles. Officers made an attempt to pull him over, but Perez fled. He finally came to a stop on eastbound State Route 52 in Santee at around 9am, but remained in the car for the next 50 minutes. During the standoff, Perez released two of his sons, who were seen running from the vehicle towards awaiting police officers. Perez, dressed in a blue sweatshirt, came out of the car and moved towards the edge of the freeway ramp railing, dangerously close to the roughly 200-foot drop-off .

He continued to hold his other children hostage inside the vehicle until about 10am, when the father and sons finally emerged from the car in the middle of the freeway. Perez came out of his car, clutching one child while another walked behind. He walked toward the edge of the freeway ramp railing, dangerously close to the roughly 200-foot drop-off, California Highway Patrol Officer Kevin Pearlstein said. 'Immediately, when he stopped there, that's what we all said, ""You just don't stop right here unless you're thinking of jumping,""' Pearlstein said. Officers shot Perez with a nonlethal bean bag and then tackled him. All four children, identified child as Jordan, 11, Jaiden, 9, Tristin, 8 and Alex, 6, were rescued and not physically harmed, officers said. In a tearful press conference Wednesday night, relatives begged for the children to be brought back. 'You're breaking our heart,' Pamela Valdez, the children's aunt, said. 'Please don't hurt the kids, please.'","Daniel Perez, 43, arrested on State Route 52 in San Diego suburb of Santee .

"Supermodel Beverly Johnson, who made history as the first black woman to appear on the cover of American Vogue, has claimed that Bill Cosby drugged and tried to take advantage of her. The 62-year-old businesswoman told Vanity Fair that the attack took place at the TV star's New York brownstone in the mid-80s, when she visited to read through lines for a small part on The Cosby Show. The comedian had  invited Ms Johnson to his home for brunch a few days earlier with her young daughter, a move that she said, in retrospect, 'seems like part of a perfectly laid out plan, a way to make me feel secure with him at all times'. Supermodel Beverly Johnson, the first black model to appear on American Vogue, has claimed that Bill Cosby drugged her in the 1980s at his New York home . On her second visit alone, Ms Johnson ate a light dinner with the star before he insisted that she have a coffee from his expensive espresso-maker. After initially refusing, the model felt pressured and took a few sips of a cappuccino he made for her. Beverly Johnson has claimed that Bill Cosby drugged her at his New York home in the late 1980s . Instantly she knew the drink had been drugged, she said. Ms Johnson wrote: 'My head became woozy, my speech became slurred, and the room began to spin nonstop. Cosby motioned for me to come over to him as though we were really about to act out the scene. 'As I felt my body go completely limp, my brain switched into automatic-survival mode. 'That meant making sure Cosby understood that I knew exactly what was happening at that very moment.' She told him: 'You are a motherf***** aren’t you?', according to the detailed Vanity Fair account, published on Thursday. The former model claimed that as the drug began to take hold of her, she repeatedly kept cursing at Cosby. The TV star appeared angry, she claimed, then grabbed her by the arm and dragged her down stairs with force before pulling her out into the street and dumping her in a taxi. MailOnline on Thursday reached out to Cosby's lawyer, Marty Singer, and was awaiting a response. Ms Johnson said that it took several days for the effects of the drug to wear off and that when they did, she called Cosby's number to confront him. Instead of the comedian, his wife Camille answered the phone and told her that it was too late for her husband to take the call and she should call back. She never did. Model Beverly Johnson poses for a portrait in September 1987 in Los Angeles (left) and at a party in Atlanta in October (right) 'At a certain moment it became clear that I would be fighting a losing battle with a powerful man so callous he not only drugged me, but he also gave me the number to the bedroom he shared with his wife,' Ms Johnson wrote in the magazine. 'In the end, just like the other women, I had too much to lose to go after Bill Cosby.' The supermodel's allegations bring the total number of women who have come forward to accuse Cosby to 24. Ms Johnson wrote that part of her reason for staying silent on Cosby was that she didn't want to be an 'angry black woman' going after highly-regarded man in the African-American community. The businesswoman said that the current racial climate in the U.S. and the cases of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner remained in her mind, even as she saw others come forward to claim that they had been attacked by Bill Cosby - including her longtime friend and fellow supermodel, Janice Dickinson. Something clicked. 'I couldn’t sit back and watch the other women be vilified and shamed for something I knew was true,' Ms Johnson told Vanity Fair. In the article, she also addressed why she had not included the Cosby allegations in her memoir published last year. Ms Johnson said she feared a 'he-said/she-said' scenario but now felt the time was right to come forward. She also said that she no longer feared damaging the African-American community by making her allegations against Cosby. She added: 'He brought this on himself when he decided he had the right to have his way with who knows how many women over the last four decades.'

"A high-ranking mafia member has been arrested in New York City. Francesco Palmeri, a member of the Gambino mob family, was apprehended by authorities after being accused of trying to extort $1.23million from an Italian businessman. He was then extradited back to Italy where he will appear before the court. Scroll down for video .

Home sweet home: After his arrest, Palmeri (above in cap) was extradited back to Italy and greeted by police upon landing . Palmeri made two separate trips to Italy in 2013 to put pressure on the owner of a southern Italian company that plans and installs electrical systems for oil platforms. The business owner also received a series of letters from 'friends in Brooklyn' asking him for money, according to the warrant. The Italian businessman was strong-armed about a loan he was given in the 1980s, the warrant says, which police said likely came from international drug traffickers connected to deceased New York mobster Cesare Bonventre, who was born in the same Sicilian town as Palmeri, Castellamare del Golfo. The  extortion emerged during a separate investigation into a trans-Atlantic drug smuggling and money laundering ring that involved members of the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta mob family and the Gambinos. Going away: Palmeri is now looking at 20 years in prison if convicted . 'This demonstrates the international reach of the 'Ndrangheta and Cosa Nostra and their still-strong ties with the historic New York mob families,' said Andrea Grassi, an investigator for SCO, an Italian anti-mafia police unit. According to investigators, the maximum sentence for criminal conspiracy to commit international extortion aggravated by mafia membership is about 20 years.","Francesco Palmeri, a leading member of the Gambino crime family, was arrested in New York City .

Dupri, 42, bought the six-bedroom, 7-bath 9,441-square-foot estate in 2005 for $3.2million. The real estate site Zillow estimates that the sprawling mansion sitting on 1.73 acres of land is currently worth just under $5million. According to Fulton County legal notices, Dupri, who over the years has worked with such A-list acts as Kriss Kros, Usher, Mariah Carey and TLC, has fallen behind on his monthly payments.

The bank later said that the songwriter was on the hook for $400,000, but the judge sided with Dupri and took his mansion off the auction block. The 42-year-old Atlanta native reportedly has made a deal with the bank agreeing to pay off his debt in monthly installments. Then in November, the owner of the deed of the mansion set the foreclosure proceedings in motion, stating that Dupri has not been making payments on a $2.5million loan he took out on the mansion nine years ago, reported Atlanta Journal Constitution. The mansion featuring a fireplace and a pool, and surrounded by manicured lawns and trees, is expected to go up for sale later this month.

"His abstract art has been criticised and praised in equal measure for its haphazard use of paint. But new research has found Jackson Pollock's drip painting may have more in common with the stylised portraits from the Medieval period than first thought. Researchers used advanced image analysis techniques to assess the colour use, brightness and contrast of nearly 8,800 paintings created between the 11th and 19th centuries. Jackson Pollock's drip paintings (left) were found to have a lot in common with Medieval art (a painting by Taddeo Gaddi pictured right) due to his use of a limited pallet of colours and lack of blending of pigments . They found that the palette of colours used by artists in Europe has expanded through history, with painters in Medieval Europe producing some of the dullest artworks. Through each period of history, the paintings showed explosions in the variety and complexity of the pigments and tints used, which coincided with the appearance of artist movements. The scientists also discovered that artists in each period of history tended to favour a different colour that appears in the majority of work from that time. It suggests that even great masters, who led many of the great art movements in Europe, were slaves to the fashions of the time. However, while most art seems to have evolved since the Renaissance to use increasing levels of vibrancy and complex colour use, Jackson Pollock's modern abstract expressionist paintings are more like Medieval art - at least as far as the way they reflect light. The researchers say that while Mr Pollock deliberately chose a limited palette for his drip paintings, Medieval artists were simply constrained by the materials available to them. Jackson Pollock created his controversial art during the 1940s by dropping paint onto a canvas, but the stark images he created may actually have more in common with Medieval art than may be apparent at first . The analysis used by the scientists was able to detect the sfumato technique used by Leonardo di Vinci to fade between objects and background in his Virgin and Child (left), along with the chiaroscuro technique to create strong light and dark contrasts, as used in by Rembrandt van Rijin in Minerva In Her Study (right) The scientists assessed the colour brightness of each painting, like in this example St John the Evangelist Drinking from the Poisoned Cup by Taddeo Gaddi. Brighter colours have a greater height on the Y-axis . Professor Hawoong Jeong, a statistical physicist who led the study at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, Korea, said: 'There is a strong preference in a small number of selected colors in the medieval age. 'The medieval period is close to that of Jackson Pollock’s drip paintings  where he used limited colors intentionally. 'We find that these mathematical measurements quantitatively describe the birth of new painting techniques and their increasing use. The researchers examined digital images of 8,798 western paintings dating from the 11th century to the mid-19th century. They divided the paintings into 10 historical periods - Medieval, Early Renaissance, Northern Renaissance, High Renaissance, Mannerism, Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, and Realism. They used techniques including chromo-spectroscopy, which treats colours like words and ranks them according to their level of use, and fractal pattern analysis, which looks at the detail contained within the colour. The study, which is published in the journal Scientific Reports, found that the colour palette among European painters expanded greatly after the Medieval period as new oil paints and pigments were introduced. 'Applying them, it is possible to deduce that the Jackson Pollock’s drip paintings are not typical art work, and of course, these are still controversial in the art world.'

The study, which is published in the journal Scientific Reports, found that the colour palette among European painters expanded greatly after the Medieval period as new oil paints and pigments were introduced. Colour brightness and contrast also changed with different styles through the Renaissance, such as sfumato - the gradual fading between object and background used by Leonardo da Vinci - and chiaroscuro - strong contrasts between light and dark used in the 17th century by Rembrandt van Rijin. Paintings by Pollock Jackson (bottom) used far duller colours than many of the images that were analysed . The scientists used image analysis techniques to study 8,798 European paintings from the 11th century . Among the images they examined were St John the Evangelist Drinking from the Poisoned Cup by medieval Italian painter Taddeo Gaddi, Children's Games by Flemish Renaissance painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder and A Sunday on La Grande Jatte by 19th century painter Georges-Pierre Seurat. Professor Jeong said:  'Using digital image processing techniques, we investigate three quantitative measures of images - the usage of individual colors, the variety of colors, and the roughness of the brightness. 'We found a difference in color usage between classical paintings and photographs, and a significantly low color variety of the medieval period. 'Rank-ordered color-usage distribution for all periods of paintings show quite universal distribution. However, the most commonly painted color is different for each period. 'One can find the reason why the box counting dimensions for the medieval age and Jackson Pollock are different from others in the historical facts. 'First, specific rare pigments were preferred for political purposes and religious reasons in the medieval age despite their expensive cost. A Sunday on La Grande Jatte by George Seurat proved particularly challenging to analyse due to his style of building up pictures with dots of primary colour and the scientists showed that he used very few colours . Pollock's paintings used fewer colours than Medieval art and were similar to those of neoclassicism but he used his colours in similar ways to the Medieval painters in terms of the amount of detail and mixing . 'Second, no technique of physical mixing between different pure colors was used in that period due to the tendency to emphasize the purity of colors and materials themselves. 'Artists recoated on a colored canvas to represent various colors in the middle age. 'The drip paintings of Jackson Pollock are also formed from recoating each single color dripping pattern on other layers, and the number of used colors is smaller than other western paintings before 20th century. 'Furthermore, oil colors and color mixing techniques were not fully developed until the Renaissance age. 'The introduction of new expression tools, like pastels and fingers, and painting techniques, such as chiaroscuro and sfumato, made much more colorful and natural expressions possible after the Renaissance period. 'The difference of fractal dimensions between the medieval and other periods quantitatively may quantitatively reflect the historical facts and the painting technical difference in art history.' However, Professor Jeong does concede that some of the analysis of the paintings will be affected by the fading of paints and pigments over time, meaning that the medieval pictures may have been more vibrant in the past.","Jackson Pollock's drip paintings were found to be similar to Medieval art .
Medieval paintings were found to contain the dullest and fewest colours .

Breathtaking: Don Pettit took several long-exposure photographs while orbiting the Earth on Expedition 31, where he was a flight engineer. To capture the light trails, Pettit took multiple 30-second exposures and combined them digitally to create images that resembled 10- to 15-minute exposures. This image shows stars, auroras and thunderstorms across the surface of the Earth . Now filmmaker Anton Lorimer, who works at photo sharing website, SmugMug, has created a captivating time-lapse featuring some of Pettit's best photos of the Earth. 'We get training on photography and the use of the cameras on space station,' explained Pettit. 'And these are professional-level cameras…they're almost like a little computer in themselves.' Astronauts on the ISS are asked to take pictures of Earth and its surrounding, providing a scientific data set that has been recorded now for over 14 years. About 1.2 million pictures were taken as of July 2012 and that number is growing. 'These images are also art,' said Pettit. 'They illustrate to people what space is like for those who don't get a chance to fly in space. Starry eyed: From star trails to auroras, Pettit's engineering ingenuity and natural curiosity has led him to create photos that are unrivalled in their beauty. This image shows an aurora forming above Earth as solar winds hit the planet's magnetosphere . Stunning: Don Pettit shot this time-lapse photos while aboard the International Space Station in 2012. Astronauts on the ISS are asked to take pictures of Earth and its surrounding, providing a scientific data set that has been recorded now for over 14 years . View from above: Most images on the ISS are taken in the cupola, where there are often as up to eight cameras set up with different lenses. At times, astronauts compete with each other for the best position . One of Pettit's favourite cameras is the 400mm f/2. 'In weightlessness, this becomes a beautiful piece of equipment to use,' said Pettit. 'You can completely control it by grabbing on to the camera. And it's heavy enough that small things like your heartbeat won't make the lens jiggle. 'If you pick up a camera body with a small lens on it, the pulse in your fingers will make the camera shake.' To get around this, Pettit taped a stick on the back of the camera, which allowed him to move the equipment with just two fingers. This meant that he could fly the camera around without physically having his fingers on the camera. And since the stick was aligned with the optical centre, he could slowly rotate the camera through 360 degrees. 'Looking at Earth from space is amazingly beautiful,' said Pettit. 'You can see things on the length scale of half a continent. But he argues that photos of Earth from space are no more beautiful than those taken from Earth. 'It's just a different perspective of what we're used to seeing,' he said. Astro-photographer: Donald Roy Pettit (pictured), 59, is a veteran of two long-duration stays aboard the International Space Station, one space shuttle mission and a six-week expedition to find meteorites in Antarctica . What are some of your favourite subjects to photograph from space? My favourite subject is the earth at night. Aurora is just amazingly beautiful. It's this glowing upper part of the atmosphere that crawls around like amoebas in the sky. Other aspects of night-time photography: atmospheric air glow. Originally people thought the atmosphere glowed more or less uniformly. But the pictures we're taking on station show that there's spatial structure in the atmospheric air glow. Then there's polar mesospheric clouds, also known as noctilucent clouds. These are clouds in the upper part of the atmosphere, right on the fringes of space, that are sort of a scientific mystery in terms of why they form. And cities at night. The way human beings sprinkle their light bulbs around is a fascinating statement on how we as human beings define our urban areas. It's a juxtaposition between geography, technology that you choose, and culture. What are some of your photographic challenges in space? The traits that make a good photograph on Earth still apply to taking a picture in space. Focus is really important. And exposure. In space, you can have huge variations in brightness. The sunny-16 rule sort of applies, but you have to add or subtract about 2 more f-stops because the full exoatmospheric sun on the tops of clouds is really bright. If you just take a standard picture, the cloud tops will all be snow white with no detail at all. So you need to underexpose your picture when you have a lot of clouds within your field of view. Aurora is also tricky. The green part of the aurora is about two stops brighter than the red part. If you expose for the greens, you won't see the reds. If you expose for the reds, the greens will be saturated. We see these same things on Earth, compromising between what you can and can't see. How did you create your star trail images? Star trail images have been photographed by amateur astronomers for years. You put your camera on a tripod, point it some place up in the sky, then as Earth turns while the shutter's open, the stars make trails. I tried the same thing from station. The dynamics are the same, but the physics behind the motions are different. You still see stars going in circles, but they're not going in circles around the north star, they're going in circles around the pitch access of station as it goes around Earth. You also see cities streak by on the surface of Earth. They move with a combination of our orbital motion and Earth turning at the same time. Then you've got the atmosphere on edge, and it glows. Scientists call that air glow. Q&A by photo-sharing site, Smugmug . Speeding bullet: 'Star trail images have been photographed by amateur astronomers for years. You put your camera on a tripod, point it some place up in the sky, then as Earth turns while the shutter's open, the stars make trails,' said Petit . No filter: About 1.2 million pictures were taken as of July 2012 and that number is growing. This incredible image of Earth's oceans was taken by Don Pettit during one of his stays aboard the ISS . Window seat: A view of Earth and the ISS' solar panels as seen from one of the windows of the cupola, where most of the space photography takes place . 'We find Earth from space exceptionally beautiful because we're so polarised to the natural beauty around us when we're walking on Earth.' But not all of the photography involves capturing the stunning views of Earth from space. 'There's a lot of engineering photography that we do,' said Pettit. 'We have to take macro images of pins in an electrical connector or a bit of grunge in a hydraulic quick-disconnect fitting or little patterns that might develop on the surface of one of the windows. These things need to be documented so the images can be downlinked for engineers on the ground to assess what's happening to the systems on space station. Most images on the ISS are taken in the cupola, where there are often as up to eight cameras set up with different lenses. At times, astronauts compete with each other for the best position. 'Say a volcano's going off,' said Pettit. 'Maybe one crewmate has a 400mm, maybe one has a midrange 85-180mm lens. 'And then someone's shooting with a wide-angle lens. We're all shooting at the same subject at the same time in this rather small space.' 'It makes my heart sing to see people using my pictures,' added Pettit. 'There's no point in taking pictures and hiding them in a closet. 'You want to take pictures and share them freely with anybody who's willing to look at your photography. And that, to me, is more of a compliment than anything else.' Incredible: 'You see cities streak by on the surface of Earth,' said Pettit. 'They move with a combination of our orbital motion and Earth turning at the same time'. In this images, Pettit attempted to capture both the stars and the city lights using long exposure photography .

"Cutting down on salt could cut headaches by a third, according to new research. People who reduced their salt intake to three grams a day suffered significantly fewer headaches, a study found. Three grams of salt is the equivalent of around half a teaspoon, or the amount found in a McDonalds Big Mac and large fries. Experts said cutting salt could reduce headaches because it lowers blood and pulse pressure. Scroll down for videos . Reducing salt intake to three grams cuts headaches by 31 per cent, a study found. Switching from an unhealthy diet to a healthy one made no difference to the frequency of headaches . But even people with normal blood pressure saw a reduction in headaches when they cut their salt intake. However, switching from a healthy diet to an unhealthy one had no effect on headaches, scientists said. As part of the study almost 400 people were randomly assigned either a low-fat diet rich in fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products or a typical Western diet as a control. Participants ate food with almost nine of salt a day for a set period, reflecting average salt consumption in the USA. Then this was reduced to six grams a day (the top level of the recommended daily salt allowance) for the same length of time, before they finally ate a low-salt diet of three grams a day during the final period. They were asked to record side effects such as headache, bloating, dry mouth, excessive thirst, fatigue or low energy, light- headedness, nausea and change in taste in a questionnaire. Scientists discovered halving salt intake from nine grams a day to three grams a day reduced headaches by 31 per cent. Lawrence Appel, of John Hopkins University said: 'A reduced sodium intake was associated with a significantly lower risk of headache, while dietary patterns had no effect on the risk of headaches in adults. 'Reduced dietary sodium intake offers a novel approach to prevent headaches.' Watch out for these foods, which are almost always high in salt because of the way that they are produced: . Professor Graham MacGregor, of Queen Mary University, London and World Action on Salt and Health (WASH) - who was not involved in the study - said scientists do not fully understand why cutting salt reduces headaches, but they suspect it is because it lowers blood and pulse pressure. He told MailOnline: 'We have long suspected that reducing salt intakes reduces the number of people developing headaches, and this study confirms our suspicions. 'Blood pressure drugs do reduce headaches, various studies and anecdotal evidence shows. 'Clearly reducing blood pressure and pulse pressure does lower headaches, even if blood pressure is already in the normal range. He added: 'This is the first well-controlled trial that really demonstrates a very large reduction in headaches just from modest reductions in salt intake. 'We would strongly advocate that those people who have headaches reduce their salt intake as it may abolish their headaches as well as having the very important effect of lowering their blood pressure and thereby the risk of a stroke and or heart attack.' Katharine Jenner, of  Consensus Action on Salt and Health (CASH), who was also not involved in the study, added: 'Rather than just reaching for the medicine cabinet, we should be thinking about what is causing our ill health; it is often lifestyle and diet-related. 'If you can get less headaches and lower your blood pressure just by eating less salt, that's two less pills you will need to take.' Experts said it is not fully understood why cutting salt reduces headaches, but they suspect it is because it lowers blood and pulse pressure .","Cutting salt from 9g to 3g a day reduced headaches by 31 per cent .

"The days of scrambling for a phone charger are coming to an end, as more people embrace wireless charging technology. And now it’s been proven that an iPhone can even be charged underwater, using a wireless pad and a mobile receiver fitted inside a waterproof Nuud Lifeproof case. The iPhone 5 handset was sealed inside the case, along with a receiver, and dropped onto a wireless charging pad into a tub of liquid. Scroll down for video . Life aquatic: It’s been proven that an iPhone can be charged underwater, using a wireless pad and a mobile receiver fitted inside a waterproof Nuud Lifeproof case (pictured) The plate stayed dry because it was plugged in beneath the container, and the phone then recharged slowly, like any other smartphone. Bavan Palasanthiran, Founder of FoneSalesman.com, based in Harrow, Greater London, conducted the experiment to prove the firm’s iQi Mobile Receiver can be used inside a sealed case. Measuring just half a millimetre thick, the receiver is designed to be used with any wireless pad. It sits under a soft case, or Lifeproof case, plugging into an iPhone’s Lightning connector port. It uses a theory initially suggested by Nikola Tesla, who demonstrated the principle of wireless charging at the turn of the century.

Measuring just half a millimetre thick, the iQi Mobile Receiver (pictured) is designed to be used with any wireless pad . The technology and theory behind wireless charging  was initially suggested by Nikola Tesla, who demonstrated the principle of wireless charging at the turn of the century. Wireless charging, also known as inductive charging, requires two coils: a transmitter and a receiver. An alternating current is passed through the transmitter coil, generating a magnetic field. This in turn induces a voltage in the receiver coil; this can be used to power a mobile device or charge a battery. It requires two coils - a transmitter and a receiver. An alternating current is passed through the transmitter coil, generating a magnetic field. This in turn induces a voltage in the receiver coil, which can be used to power a mobile device or charge a battery. In the case of the iQi device, the transmitter coil is thin because the circuits are printed, enabling it to fit inside a phone case and be almost ‘invisible’. ‘The technology’s improving, but we’re still at phase one,' Mr Palasanthiran told MailOnline. He expects we’ll be able to charge our smartphones at greater distances wirelessly within the next decade. He added it is the first time, to his knowledge that wireless technology, has been used to charge a phone underwater, because ‘no-one else makes this kind of receiver that can fit under a Lifeproof case,’ enabling an iPhone to stay dry and fully functional. He believes there is demand for the technology, which may appeal to divers and seamen. While the technology has many benefits in a watery environment, Mr Palasanthiran said that it is around 75 per cent efficient compared to simply charging a phone from a plug socket. The iQi receiver costs £14.99 and does not come with a wireless charging pad, or Lifeproof case. Invisible: The thin receiver sits under a soft case, or Lifeproof case, plugging into an iPhone’s Lightning connector port (pictured) Scientists in the US have developed a device that could charge your phone at a distance - even while it’s still in your pocket – so you will never run out of juice again. The prototype MagMIMO wireless charger can charge an iPhone 4 battery in five hours, at a distance of 12 inches (30cm) away, it was reported in September. While wireless chargers already exist, they require a phone to be placed directly on a charging ‘pad’ so users still have to remember to charge their phones and place them on the device in the right way. Dina Katabi, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who is behind the new technology, told New Scientist: ‘In our vision we wanted to have people's phone charge the minute they are sitting next to their desk: they go to a meeting, they come back, the phone starts charging again.’ The prototype uses a magnetic coil to beam energy to a phone around 12 inches away and it doesn't matter how the phone is positioned – so it could be lying on a desk or in someone’s pocket. The idea is that coils could one day be placed around homes and offices to top up the batteries of devices detected nearby. ‘MagMIMO consumes as much power as existing solutions, yet it can charge a phone remotely without being removed from the user's pocket,’ Dr Katabi and her team wrote in a paper which they shared at the International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking in Maui, Hawaii. MagMIMO's transmitter has a number of coils inside to that generate a magnetic field. When a phone enters that field, its presence is detected by the transmitter. It then focuses its energy on the phone that is within range by generating varying frequencies. This creates a stronger overall magnetic field that can reach the phone. It's hoped that the technology could help speed the take-up of smart watches, which will likely need to be charged daily, such as the Apple Watch, which supports wireless charging.","iPhone 5 handset was sealed inside a Nuud Lifeproof case and submerged .

"A mother whose weight ballooned after passing her driving test has told how ditching her car helped her to beat the bulge. Alyson Larkin gorged on junk food and fizzy drinks and saw her weight soar after she stopped walking regularly. The 33-year-old lived on microwave meals and takeaways while drinking five cans of coke and downing a glass of wine every day. Alyson Larkin, 33, from Gourock, Inverclyde piled on weight (left) after buying a car and eating takeaways or microwave meals every day. She sold her Corsa and dropped three dress sizes in just a few months (right) But the beauty therapist decided to change her unhealthy lifestyle when she could no longer fit into her trousers. Alyson of Gourock, Inverclyde, sold her Vauxhall Corsa car and started a strict exercise regime and healthy diet which soon saw the weight fall off. She lost three stone (42lbs) and dropped three dress sizes through an online weight loss programme that encourages people to eat healthily and exercise. She said: 'All my life I had been eight and a half stone but when I turned 29, I learned to drive and bought a car. 'Pretty soon I wasn't walking anywhere anymore. I used to walk around seven miles a day and never took public transport. 'I was also working 30 hours a week in a beauty salon and studying at college. Because I was shattered I would just have a microwave meal or a takeaway, like an Indian or Chinese most nights.' Alyson sold her Vauxhall Corsa car and started a strict exercise regime and healthy diet which soon saw her extra weight fall off . She continued: 'I would also have a glass or two of wine as I was over-tired and I thought it would help me sleep. 'Before I knew it, I was always wearing leggings and jogging bottoms because that was how I felt comfortable.' During this time, Alyson, who is single, said her weight changed from eight stone (112lbs) to 11 stone (154lbs), with her dress going from a size 8 to a size 14/16. She added: 'I didn't realise how much weight I had put on as I wore a stretchy tunic and leggings for work. 'But I finally realised when I went to try on a pair of size 10 trousers and I couldn't get anywhere near fitting into them.' After getting a car, Alyson said her weight changed from eight stone (112 lbs) to 11 stone (154lbs), with her dress going from a size 8 to a size 14/16 . She continued: 'One day I was moaning to a friend about how much weight I had gained and she said that'll be because of the car, you're not exercising anymore. 'I realised she was right and set about getting rid of it. It made me really sad because it was a mint green Corsa and pretty distinctive but I had to let it go.' Alyson then stumbled across a weight loss scheme called 'Frank Personal Training,' which she says has changed her life. She changed her diet and started taking regular exercise. Since changing her diet and starting to take regular exercise, Alyson has successfully lost three stone and is back to her original weight of just over eight stone (112lbs). Alyson said: 'When I came off the diet coke in the first couple of days, I was shaking and had such bad headaches. 'But after just two weeks I could feel the difference. I had so much more energy and I was bouncing out of bed in the morning.' Alyson has successfully lost three stone and is back to her original weight of just over eight stone. She added: 'I have always been really chatty and outgoing but I think I hid how I was feeling. Now I have bundles of energy and I feel a lot more confident.

"A trial testing an experimental Ebola vaccine has been suspended amid concerns over potential side-effects. The decision to pause the Swiss clinical trial at the University of Geneva was taken after four volunteers reported suffering joint pain in their hands and feet. The hospital said the move is a 'precautionary measure', after the volunteers had the injection 10 to 15 days earlier. The Geneva researchers reported on December 2 that the first people vaccinated with the experimental drug had experienced no serious side effects, with a few suffering a mild fever. But today, the hospital said the four patients had suffered joint pain, which lasted a few days. WHO vaccine expert Marie-Paule Kieny said the suspension of an Ebola vaccine trial at the University of Geneva Hospital is 'not a setback at all'. It was paused after four of 59 volunteers reported suffering joint pain in their hands and feet. The trial is set to resume in January in 15 volunteers, the hospital said . Scientists are racing to develop vaccines to combat the deadly virus, which has killed more than 6,300 people - the majority in the West African nations, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Experts believe millions of doses of vaccine may be needed to bring this, the worst Ebola outbreak in history, to an end and contain future epidemics. The global vaccines alliance, GAVI, has today committed up to $300 million to buy any future vaccines. GAVI, which is funded by governments and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said it is ready to begin procurement of a vaccine as soon as the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends a drug for use. Officials involved in the Swiss trial of a drug developed by the Canadian government and licensed to two US companies, NewLink and Merck, said all 59 volunteers who received the jab are fine. 'They are all fine and being monitored regularly by the medical team leading the study,' the hospital said in a statement. The trial was started last month and is set to resume on January 5 in 15 volunteers after checks to ensure the joint pain symptoms were 'benign and temporary', the hospital said. The team was in close contact with researchers in the United States, Germany, Canada and Gabon who are carrying out the same trial with the Merck and NewLink vaccine, it said. 'These centres have not observed symptoms of inflammation in their volunteers to date,' it added. WHO vaccine expert Marie-Paule Kieny, said the delay would allow time to see how widespread the problems are. Scientists are racing to develop vaccines to combat the deadly virus, which has killed more than 6,300 people - the majority in the West African nations, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea . But it was expected that after the delay the trial will be able to continue as originally planned, she added. 'It's not a setback, not at all,' she said in Geneva. And the WHO downplayed the setback, pointing out that temporary suspensions are not uncommon in clinical trials. Researchers hope safe and effective vaccines will get a green light as soon as next year, although there is uncertainty over how well they will work and how many doses will be needed. Last month WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan said a vaccine to protect millions from Ebola decades after the virus was first detected in the 70s, does not exist because the disease previously only affected poor African nations. The head of the World Health Organisation's scathing conclusion came at a point when nearly 5,000 people had lost their lives to the hemorrhagic fever. Dr Chan criticized drugs companies for turning their backs on 'markets that cannot pay'. She said the current outbreak - the most deadly in history - has exposed two WHO arguments 'that have fallen on deaf ears for decades'. The global vaccines alliance, GAVI, has today committed up to $300 million to buy any future vaccines . Addressing the regional committee for Africa in Benin on November 3, Dr Chan said: 'Ebola emerged nearly four decades ago. Why are clinicians still empty handed, with no vaccines and no cure? 'Because Ebola has historically been confined to poor African nations. 'The R&D (research and development) incentive is virtually non-existent. 'A profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay. 'WHO has been trying to make this issue visible for ages. Now people can see it for themselves.' But the money now earmarked by GAVI will help to bridge the gap and is expected to be enough to procure up to 12 million courses of a vaccine. WHO vaccine expert Marie-Paule Kieny, said the commitment is 'fantastic'. In addition to helping tackle the current epidemic, the money could also be used to create stockpiles of Ebola vaccines, similar to those that exist for yellow fever, meningitis and cholera. A further $90 million will be made available from GAVI's funds to help those affected in the hardest hit nations, and introduce the vaccines while helping to rebuild their broken health systems. GAVI, which was set up in 2000 with private and government donor backing, has a track record of bulk-buying vaccine supplies from manufacturers at a low price for the developing world. Since 2000, around 440 million children have been immunised against a range of diseases through its programmes. GAVI said its board had decided to prepare for procuring Ebola vaccines while still awaiting a green light for the first product, 'in light of the seriousness of the situation and the risks associated with delays in making a vaccine available'. Two vaccines, one from NewLink and Merck and a rival shot from GlaxoSmithKline, are already undergoing human trials and third one, made by Johnson & Johnson, is about to enter clinical testing. 'We've had individual discussions with all of the manufacturers and continue to work closely with them,' GAVI's chief executive, Seth Berkley, said. GAVI said it would meet the funding needs of the Ebola vaccine programme using a combination of existing and new financing. It also plans to join forces with other initiatives that have already pledged funding to address the Ebola crisis.","The trial taking place at the University of Geneva was paused today .

"A married couple has been awarded over $1 million in compensation after successfully bringing a harassment complaint against Bank of America for being subjected to hundreds of loan collection calls over a four year period. Nelson and Joyce Coniglio, of Tampa, Florida, received more than 700 automated calls after they fell behind on mortgage loan payments in 2009. In a complaint filed in federal court in July, attorneys for the couple said they had been on the receiving end of 'patterns of outrageous, abusive and harassing conduct' by a subsidiary of Bank of America. Joyce and Nelson Coniglio, of Tampa, Florida, received more than 700 automated calls after they fell behind on mortgage loan payments in 2009 . The Coniglios, who are both 69 and have been married for 45 years, also received 'threatening collection letters asserting false and misleading information,' the complaint said. Over the years, the couple had sent multiple cease-and-desist letters from lawyers asking the bank to stop, but the robocalls - sometimes up to five a day - continued. 'They treated us very badly,' Nelson told WTSP. 'No two ways about it.' 'We would be out at dinner and they would ring my mother's cellphone,' son Jason Coniglio told the Tampa Bay Times, 'then they would call my dad's cellphone and then when we got back to the house, there would be another message on the answering machine.' At their wits ends, the couple sued under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act and the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act. 'Once a debt collector is told to stop calling, whether it be in writing or verbally, it doesn't make a difference,' said David Mitchell, one of the family's attorneys. Bank of America, which lost the case because it missed the deadline to oppose the lawsuit, maintains that the calls were to help the Coniglios avoid foreclosure . 'Every call after that is considered a willful violation of the (law.)' The Coniglios won by default in October after the bank missed the deadline to oppose the lawsuit. Last week the judge dismissed the bank's attempt to set aside the default judgment and awarded the couple $1,051,000 - approximately $1,500 for every call - in addition to court costs and attorney fees. 'This judgment against Bank of America is an epic win for consumers across the country,' Billy Howard, an attorney for the Coniglios told ABC News. 'It's time to fight back against these 'robo-bullies'.' Bank of America has claimed the calls were really to help the Coniglios avoid foreclosure. The Coniglios’ attorney said the pay-out was an ‘epic win for consumers’. 'It's time to fight back against these 'robo-bullies',' said Billy Howard . 'Because our calls were not answered and our efforts to help the Coniglios avoid foreclosure were urgent, these calls continued. We are committed to help homeowners in need of assistance avoid foreclosure,' said Bank of America Senior Vice President Dan Frahm. The Coniglios' case isn't the first time Bank of America has faced accusations of intense harassment by phone. In September 2013, the bank paid a record $32 million to settle a class action lawsuit with a reported 7.7 million customers who claimed they were harassed by such 'robocalls.' In that case, Bank of America said it denied the allegations but settled to avoid further legal costs.","Nelson and Joyce Coniglio, of Tampa, Florida, were subjected to hundreds of loan collection calls over a four year period .

"A young woman woke from a life-threatening seizure to discover she'd given birth to a 1lb baby. Gemma Jamieson, 23,  collapsed and suffered a huge fit when she was just 24 weeks pregnant. While she lay unconscious, doctors battled to deliver her baby and save both their fragile lives. Remarkably, Mrs Jamieson survived her ordeal, but woke up three days later with no memory of giving birth to the little boy she had carried for six months. Miss Jamieson, from Hull, East Yorkshire, said: 'I remember waking up and my husband, Dale, showing me a picture of a baby on his phone, and explaining it was our son. 'I couldn't believe it - I had no memory of giving birth - it was all so surreal. 'I felt robbed of the experience of pregnancy as I hadn't even felt our baby kick. Gemma Jamieson, 23, woke up from a near-fatal seizure and discovered she'd given birth to her baby son, Tyler. The pair are pictured, with Tyler now s 17 months old . Mrs Jamieson (right) had no idea she'd had a Caesarean section to give birth to Tyler. She and husband Dale, 24 (left), had been at a car festival when she suffered a seizure and was rushed to hospital . Tyler was born prematurely and weighing just 1lb. He was rushed to another hospital for treatment as his lungs had not developed properly. He is pictured here at three weeks old, when doctors said he had a one in ten chance of survival. He underwent a heart operation and 17 blood transfusions a week later . 'Dale told me how much our baby weighed, how old he was, that he was very poorly and being treated in a different hospital. 'I couldn't believe what had happened, to know that I'd missed out on his birth, and that all our relatives had seen him before me was almost too much to bear. 'Giving birth is one of the biggest moments of a women's life - and I missed it. 'I just wanted to see him straight away and make sure he was OK.' Slowly, Mrs Jamieson recovered from the near fatal pre-eclampsia that had caused her seizures. Pre-eclamsia affects five per cent of pregnant women, causing high blood pressure and swelling in the feet, ankles and hands. Only one to two per cent develop severe complications like the convulsions Mrs Jamieson suffered. After an agonising seven day wait while she recovered, she finally met her son, Tyler, now 17 months. She said: 'Dale led me into a room full of newborn babies and I had to ask which was ours. 'But as soon as I saw Tyler I burst into tears - I felt bonded with him immediately. 'All my energy was focused on him and helping him get better.' The ordeal ordeal began when Mr and Mrs Jamieson attended a car festival in July last year. Pre-eclamsia affects some pregnant women, usually during the second half of pregnancy (from around 20 weeks) It causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine  - signs that should be picked up during routine antenatal check-ups. Occasionally, symptoms can include swelling in the feet, ankles and hands, vision problems headaches and pain just below the ribs. Although the exact cause of pre-eclampsia is not known, it is thought to occur when there is a problem with the placenta. If left untreated it can cause the convulsions that Mrs Jamieson experienced. Although most cases of pre-eclampsia cause no problems and improve soon after the baby is delivered, there is a risk of serious complications that can affect both the mother and  baby. There is a risk the mother will develop fits called eclampsia. These fits can be life threatening for the mother and the baby, but they are rare. Source: NHS . 'Gemma was sitting in the car and she shouted at me because her shoulder was twitching,' Mr Jamieson recalls. 'It just suddenly escalated and she was having a big fit. 'I just couldn't believe what was happening. 'She must have bit down on her tongue because it swelled up and she was having trouble breathing. 'I managed to give her mouth to mouth - the paramedics said that if I hadn't been there she might not have even made it to the hospital.' After being rushed to hospital, Mrs Jamieson began to have her second violent seizure which doctors later discovered was as a result of pre-eclampsia. It was then that doctors explained that the only chance of saving her life, was to deliver her baby early. Mrs Jamieson said: 'I vaguely remember arguing with the doctors because I didn't want them to deliver Tyler so early. 'But the doctors told me I was in severe danger - minutes away from death - and I needed to get to theatre. 'I was then in and out of consciousness for the next three days. 'I don't remember giving birth to Tyler or seeing him at all. 'I have no memory of what happened.' Tyler was delivered by Caesarean section while both his and Mrs Jamieson's life hung in the balance. Mr Jamieson said: 'When Tyler was born, Gemma was totally out of it. 'They told me his chances of survival were really slim, it was just awful. 'Tyler was then transferred to a different hospital and I just spent the days going in between the two. 'It was awful to see Gemma so ill, knowing that she had a baby that she'd never ever met.' Tyler not only underwent a heart operation, but 17 blood transfusions and five rounds of laser eye surgery to save his sight. Doctors said he had a 98 per cent chance of being blind, but parents are thrilled he now has driving standard eyesight. He is pictured here recovering at home with his mother . Tyler's parents call him their 'little miracle' as he survived against the odds and is now healthy. Mr Jamieson called his wife and his son 'incredible' Over the next few days doctors finally managed to stabilize her, but despite her quick recovery, little Tyler faced a long battle ahead, with just a one in ten chance of survival. Mrs Jamieson said: 'Tyler is really the fighter in all of this. 'He was born at just 24 weeks and was so premature that his lungs hasn't developed properly, so he was battling chronic lung disease. 'He had to have 17 blood transfusions, and was really struggling to survive. 'When I first saw him his skin was almost see through and he tubes coming out of him everywhere. 'He was on a ventilator and had a hat on him - all I could do was stroke him as he had to stay in his incubator.' Little Tyler then went on a year long journey in order to recover. Mrs Jamieson said: 'To begin with Tyler was very ill. 'He had to go to Great Ormond Street for a heart operation when he was just 4 weeks old. 'Then we were told he had a 98 per cent chance of been blind and he underwent five lots of laser eye surgery. 'Dale and I were warned on more than one occasion that he may not make it. 'But over time he just seemed to get better and better. 'Slowly but surely he began to breathe on his own. 'When he was six months old, we finally got to take him home and it was the best day ever. 'His eye sight is now as good as driving standard which is a miracle. 'He's gone from strength to strength and about three weeks before his first birthday in July, he finally came off his oxygen for good.' Mrs Jamieson and Dale are now enjoying time at home with their healthy son. Dale said: 'It's amazing to think that after everything they've both through they're both here to tell the tale. 'I could have lost them both so I feel lucky to have my family here. 'They're incredible.'","Gemma Jamieson was six months pregnant when she suffered a fit .

"In the future, many predict technology will be more intelligent and more living than most people can imagine today. But an expert has warned we need clear guidelines on how to implement and use technology, or else citizens will lose their rights to their identity and their life. He says there is a solution, though, which involves putting the public back in control of their own data - rather than leaving it to big corporations. AI expert Dr Rasmussen from the University of South Denmark has warned of the rise of technology. Companies like Facebook and Google have too much of our data, he said. And if we don't control our own data we could lose our identities (stock image shown) The prediction was made by Danish professor Dr Steen Rasmussen, an expert in artificial life from the University of Southern Denmark, in a new international book about the future of technology. It is already happening every day, he said: States, intelligence services, Facebook, Google and smartphones collect detailed data about everything in our lives. 'One may think it is harmless if Facebook knows that I drink too much or have sexual relations outside my marriage, or that I love strawberry jam,' he said. Facebook is developing artificial intelligence software to help users decide what they should and shouldn't upload to the social network. The software could even warn users if someone else uploads a snap of them, Facebook has revealed. It hopes the software will 'mediate' users interactions with their friends. 'Imagine that you had an intelligent digital assistant which would mediate your interaction with your friends and also with content on Facebook,' the head of the Facebook AI lab, Yann LeCun, told Wired. His project hopes to analyse everything uploaded to the social network, from video to pictures. But he said that giving large organisations and governments access to such data could be dangerous. 'One may also think that authorities only look in our data if there is reason to suspect a crime. But leaderships change. 'Historically, we know that democratic governments can be taken over by dictatorships. Remember that democratic elections put the Nazis in the German Reichstag. 'A dictatorship has a completely different approach to control or punishment. In such a state data could be used to persecute citizens rather than to protect and serve them. He added: 'I believe the problem will escalate dramatically in the near future, if citizens do not protest. 'The technology is complicated and has developed explosively in the last generation, which means that neither our decision makers nor our media understand what is going on - and more importantly, they cannot imagine how technology could be used differently.' 'One may think it is harmless if Facebook knows that I drink too much or have sexual relations outside my marriage, or that I love strawberry jam,' he said. But Dr Rasmussen said that giving large organisations and governments access to such data, such as through our phones (stock image shown), could be dangerous . Dr Rasmussen points out that there are good technological possibilities to solve the problem. 'We could, for instance, modify our digital infrastructure, so it is the individual citizens and not the state or the big companies that own our data.' In the book 'Beta-Life - Stories from an A-Life Future', an international group of researchers and writers worked together to give an insight into how the world might look like in 2070. Professor Steen Rasmussen is scientific consultant on a story by Sarah Dean. The story is about a little boy, his parents and his PM - Personal Maker, an advanced 3D printer - that can print almost everything that the little boy could wish for. But behind the boy's innocent play, the reader gets a glimpse of a monitored society where it is not the boy and his parents who have control over the PM. Instead, other powers have patented the technology in the boy's PM, and hence there is no free and democratic access to or use of the technology. Instead the boy's playing is guided by hidden controllers with their own agenda. Dr Rasmussen also warned that in future artificial intelligence may be 'controlled' by larger organisations or governments, preventing us from having our own true experiences (stock image shown) Our desire to create helpful digital assistants and self-driving vehicles could bring about our demise. Professor Stephen Hawking has warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment. Speaking at an event in London, the physicist told the BBC that: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' This echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history, [but] unfortunately, it might also be the last.' He argues that developments in digital personal assistants Siri, Google Now and Cortana are merely symptoms of an IT arms race which 'pale against what the coming decades will bring.' 'I'd rather not be a part of such a society. I do not want international monopolies, a government or other authority to collect my data and prevent me from sharing my ideas and what I create and produce, with whom I want,' said Dr Rasmussen. 'My data, my opinions, my ideas and what I make must belong to me. The individual citizen's data must be protected from abuse.' According to Dr Rasmussen, there are no miracle cures, but there are better technical solutions than the ones we have today. These solutions require a restructuring of our digital infrastructure - first of all, different degrees of encryption of our private data are needed so that only the individual citizen can see everything. 'We need laws that ban Facebook, Google and others from storing data about us unless we allow them to. 'As these services often need to make money, we could pay a small amount every month for their services. 'In this way they earn money from us directly and not from spying on us and selling our data.' Recently others such as Stephen Hawking have warned of the rise of technology. He said that warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself. Speaking at an event in London, he told the BBC: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race' He continued: 'Also it is not good that we can readily be identified on the Internet. It should be possible to conduct online transactions without our whole identity following the transaction. 'In principle it should only be possible for companies or authorities to access our identity in the context of digital transactions if there is a legal basis for it. 'This must however be weighed up against the possibility of giving criminals easier play on the Internet. There are great business opportunities for truly democratic countries to develop the first democratic digital infrastructure. Citizens in the rest of the world would of course want to buy such an infrastructure afterwards. Dr Rasmussen called for an understanding that things are not acceptable, as they are today. And he would like decision-makers and media to 'wake up' and understand that digital technology allows for much better solutions than we have today. Solutions that put the citizen in the center - not the state or large multinational companies, he said.","AI expert Dr  Rasmussen from the University of South Denmark has warned of the rise of technology .

"It's not every day hundreds of tourists gather to worship at the spot of a severed tree branch. But in the tiny village of Pocboc, Mexico, believers are coming from far and wide to pray next to a tree they believe contains an image of the Virgin Mary. While it may not look so obvious to those without a large imagination (and a strong will to believe) religious villagers and tourists who are flocking to the site are so convinced of the likeness they insist it is a modern-day miracle. Spot the difference: The 'miracle' tree image (left) and a more traditional painting of the Virgin Mary (right) Dozens of candles and flowers are being put daily in place at the foot of the tree as an offering to the image that they consider a miracle, despite skeptics saying it is nothing more than a pattern created by the tree rings. Pocboc is in the municipality of Hecelchakan in the south-eastern Mexican state of Campeche, where Prince Charles and Camilla recently visited. Residents of the village say that the silhouette of the Virgin suddenly appeared in the trunk of the Melina tree (Gmelina arborea) and now locals are being joined by Catholic faithful from far and wide. A 75-year-old villager, Dona Lidia, discovered the image while on an afternoon stroll to her work as a cleaner at the local high school. 'I have been working here for 18 years and always take this route and I can assure you that the image was not there before,' she said. 'I instantly had to tell my neighbours and when they came the word quickly spread.' Scores of people from Mexico's Campeche City (above) have flocked to Pocboc to see the image . The tree stump in Rathkeale, Co. Limerick, which had people visiting to pray in 2009 . She said that soon people were arriving from far and wide to view the discovery of the 'Virgencita' (Little Virgin). Another villager, Lidia del Socorro Moo, 55, said, 'Many hundreds of people have come to meet her, they bought her flowers and candles. All the villagers that believe have come here to visit.' The director of the school where the cleaner was heading is Jose Francisco Farfan, 59, who said: 'Nothing like this has ever happened around here before, it must be a miracle.' Maria del Rosario, 34, is one of many who ignore the sceptics. 'For me it is a miracle. I believe that God sent it to give us his blessing, so there will be an end to suffering,' she said. The residents have planned a festival around the tree tomorrow (December 12). They are also going to ask the regional bishop if the image in the piece of wood could be considered as an official miracle. The last time the Virgin Mary was 'seen' in a tree was in 2009 when a tree stump in Rathkeale, Co. Limerick, which workmen said bore her likeness was visited by believers with candles and prayers. Sceptics said at the time that the believers were barking up the wrong tree.","A 75-year-old cleaner first discovered the likeness in a tree in Mexico .

"Scientists have created a new type of ice that could help geologists better understand the planet’s inner workings, as well as combat climate change. Named Ice XVI, it is the least dense of all known forms of ice and has a delicate cage-like structure that can trap gaseous molecules. These molecules can be anything from methane to carbon dioxide, and are contained in ‘clathrate’ cages deep beneath the sea floor. Researchers have unveiled a new solid phase of ice that’s the lowest density known. The cage-like structure originally formed surrounding neon atoms (blue). The neon was removed (red lines) to uncover its composition . By uncovering the intricate structure of these clathrates, scientists hope they can use it for carbon capture and storage, by removing methane from the sea floor and replacing it with CO2. Scientists at University of Göttingen in Germany and the Institut Laue Langevin in France suspected that the structure of an empty clathrate may look like, but up until now it was hypothetical. This is because clathrates are wrapped around other atoms in a configuration too fragile to be untangled. To separate the delicate clathrate cage from its guest molecules, scientists used vacuum pump, coupled with very low temperatures. To separate the clathrate cage from its guest molecules, scientists used vacuum pump, coupled with very low temperatures. This image shows the reactor at the Institut Laue-Langevin where the research was conducted . They used neon atoms as the guest molecules, which, when exposed to the vacuum, were slowly drawn away without damaging the cage. Clathrates, also called gas hydrates were discovered in 1810 by Sir Humphrey Davy. They crystalline solids which look like ice, and which occur when water molecules form a cage-like structure around smaller 'guest molecules'. The most common guest molecules are methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide. In the 1930s, these tiny ice cages turned out to be a major problem, clogging pipelines during transportation of gas under cold conditions. By uncovering the intricate structure of these clathrates, scientists hope they can use it for carbon capture and storage, by removing methane from the sea floor and replacing it with CO2. What was left was Ice XVI, which researchers hope to use to explore the intricate structure of a clathrate hydrate. Thomas Hansen, one of the study authors and instrument scientist on D20 at the ILL, said: 'It is important to note that clathrates could also be formed with carbon dioxide gas which would create stable compounds on the ocean floor. ‘This means there is a possibility we could extract methane and convert it to useful energy, and replace it with the CO2. ‘In other words, we could pump CO2 down to the ocean floor as a replacement for the methane in the gas hydrates. ‘The challenges involved would naturally be large and the feasibility has been called into question, but it remains an extremely intriguing possibility worth exploring . As well as its use in carbon capture and storage, the new ice may help when it comes to pumping natural gas, which often comes with clathrates. Such research could help ease the flow of gas and oil through pipelines in low temperature environments, and open up untapped reservoirs of natural gas on the ocean floor.","The new type of ice was created by scientists from France and Germany .
They hope to use the Ice XVI to extract methane from beneath the ocean .
Methane can then be converted used as energy, with the bi-product of CO2 being pumped back underground and stored outside of the atmosphere .

"People sporting muffin tops, beer bellies and love handles are twice as likely to develop a serious heart problem than their thinner counterparts. While obesity has long been seen as a risk to heart health, new research shows midriff bulge has been linked to a sudden, and often fatal, heart malfunction. As the name suggests, sudden cardiac death occurs without warning, explains the report in the British Medical Journal. It is caused by an unexpected loss of heart function, which rapidly reduces blood flow around the body, including to the brain. Midriff bulge has been linked to a sudden, and often fatal, heart malfunction called sudden cardiac death . The U.S. researchers wanted to find out if those with muffin tops and beer bellies are at greater risk of sudden cardiac death, as the evidence suggests this distribution of body fat may be more dangerous. The risk was ascertained using the waist to hip ratio - calculated by dividing the waist measurement by the hip measurement. Studies show people with the highest waist to hip ratio are twice as likely to be affected as those with ratio in the normal range. But the researchers wanted to find out if those with muffin tops and beer bellies are at greater risk of sudden cardiac death - as the evidence suggests this distribution of body fat may be more dangerous. It is thought that carrying fat around the stomach - and therefore vital organs - is more dangerous than carrying it around the hips or thighs. The scientists, of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, studied almost 15,000 middle-aged men and women aged between 45 and 64. All the people were taking part in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, which has been tracking the causes of artery narrowing in middle-aged Americans since 1987. All the participants underwent a detailed health assessment in 1987-89, and then again in 1990-92, 1993-95, 1996-98 and 2011-13. It is thought that carrying fat around the stomach - and therefore vital organs - is more dangerous than carrying it around the hips or thighs. This included measurements of weight, height, waist circumference and the waist to hip ratio. During the monitoring period, which averaged 12.5 years, sudden cardiac deaths occurred. On average, those affected were in their mid-50s, two-thirds of victims were men and 40 per cent were of African American heritage. Unsurprisingly, those who died suddenly tended to have more known risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol. They also had a higher BMI (Body Mass Index), larger waist circumference and a larger waist to hip ratio - an indicator of central obesity - than those who were not affected. The risk of sudden cardiac death was associated with general obesity, but only in non-smokers. And of the measures of obesity - BMI, waist circumference, and waist to hip ratio - the latter was the most strongly linked to sudden cardiac death risk after taking other influential factors into account. And unlike BMI and waist circumference, the link between waist to hip ratio stood regardless of existing coronary heart disease, diabetes or high blood pressure and other known risk factors. The researchers stressed the study is an observational one, so no definitive conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. They added the precise mechanisms for the association between sudden cardiac death and central obesity are not known. However it is known that fat around the midriff is thought to be more critical than fat stored elsewhere in the body, because of its influence on inflammation.","Midriff bulge doubles the risk of suffering from sudden cardiac death .
Biggest risk is in people with large waist to hip ratio, say U.S. researchers .

"A British Airways flight to Dubai was forced to return to London Heathrow Airport this afternoon after the jumbo jet’s undercarriage wheels failed to fully retract following take-off. Witnesses on the ground near Biggin Hill in south-east London reported hearing a ‘loud bang’ as the Boeing 747-400, carrying 274 passengers and 16 crew, flew overhead shortly after 1pm. For more than 30 minutes, the plane circled with its wheels down over south-east London and Kent and it dumped fuel before it was cleared to land at Heathrow.

This radar map shows the Boeing 747-400's flight path as it circled over south-east London and Kent . A BA spokesperson told MailOnline Travel that the flight crew did not declare an emergency and the plane landed without incident despite the issue with its wheels. The spokesperson said: ‘The pilot couldn’t retract the undercarriage take-off, and decided to return to Heathrow to get the problem fixed sooner rather later. ‘The aircraft landed safely back at Heathrow after a technical problem. ‘We're sorry for the delay to our customers’ journey who will soon be on another aircraft and on their way to Dubai.’ A spokeswoman said the pilot consulted engineers while the plane was in the air and they instructed him to turn around. The spokeswoman said passengers and crew were 'happy and relaxed' following the incident. People on the ground reported  a 'loud bang' as the plane flew overhead in south-east London (file photo) Witness Tony Southgate said he was at home near Biggin Hill when he heard a loud bang. He told MailOnline Travel: ‘I heard this low rumbling boom and my dog jumped up and I looked outside the windows. ‘I saw this plane that was leaving (London) turn around and circle back. ‘The two could be completely unrelated but a few of my neighbours heard it as well.’ Mr Southgate managed to snap a photo of the plane as it flew overhead in a holding pattern. He said: ‘It was very unusual because when they circle normally the wheels are up. ‘It seemed to be flying perfectly normal. It was a bit lower than they normally are in the loop, but it seemed to be perfectly fine.’ The plane flew in triangle formations over south-east London and Kent for more than 30 minutes . Tony Southgate said he heard a 'big bang' before he spotted the plane circling with its wheels down . Plane spotter Nicholas Hair, who lives in Bexleyheath, south-east London, said: ‘I saw the plane circling with the landing gear down six times over Sevenoaks which is not meant to happen. ‘I was nine miles away from Sevenoaks, but I heard the bang at 1.40pm. ‘I was quite a distance away and the noise was a bit quieter, but for people in Sevenoaks it would have been a lot louder.’ He claims the aircraft involved is one of the oldest in BA’s fleet, having entered service 24 years ago, and is due to be retired as new aircraft are introduced. He added: ‘It is an obvious case that anything mechanical becomes less reliable over time and in the wake of the Clacton and Double Riyadh incident it is causing concern among British Airways passengers, myself being one of them, and I now actively avoid flying on those aircraft.' Mr Hair claimed the incident is not the first occasion that British Airways has suffered technical difficulties with its jumbo jets. He said: 'This is the fourth 747 to have a significant problem with the landing gear or wing flaps in the last 12 to 15 months and it seems to be British Airways only.' Passenger Richard King sent a tweet expressing his frustration over the delay . Passenger James Dempsey informed his followers that the plane experienced a landing gear problem . The BA spokesperson said the crew didn't hear a bang while the plane was in the air, adding: 'Trying to retract wheels doesn’t cause any kind of bang noise.' Mr Hair, who works for a railway company, believes the crew failed to hear the bang because of insulation on board. He said: 'Inside insulation would mean that people on board would not be able to hear the loud bang or it would seem quieter, like a completely different noise.' The BA spokesperson confirmed that the plane dumped fuel before landing, which is standard procedure in such a situation. Flight BA107 was met by emergency crews when it returned to Terminal 5, and some of its passengers vented their frustration on Twitter. Passenger Richard King tweeted: ‘Just took off from Heathrow for Dubai but landing gear issues so dumping fuel mid-air and returning with emergency crews on standby.’ Another passenger, James Dempsey, tweeted: ‘Just had a lovely 1hr flight from Heathrow to Heathrow on board the new style BA 747-400 with fixed landing gear.’ The Civil Aviation Authority is awaiting information from British Airways about the incident. A Heathrow Airport spokesman said: 'We have response procedures for situations like this and our crews on the ground would have been alerted. 'British Airways would have contacted air traffic control about the problem and that is a separate agency. 'The passengers would be sent back into the terminal buildings once it landed so our involvement would have been pretty limited. 'We have safety procedures in place and we're able to respond to things should they develop, but I don't think that was the case in this instance.'","Boeing 747's wheels failed to retract into its undercarriage after take-off .

"It's a theory that many women have held for years. And now a study has revealed men really are the more stupid sex. Analysis of the Darwin Awards - an annual review of the most foolish ways people have died - has found almost 90 per cent of the accolades were 'won' by males. Worthy candidates include a terrorist who opened his own letter bomb, and a man who attempted to travel by hitching a shopping trolley to a train. Scroll down for video . What would Darwin say? A 20-year analysis of the Darwin Awards - an annual review of the most foolish ways people have died - has found almost 90 per cent of the accolades were 'won' by males . It is named after Charles Darwin, the scientist famous for the theory of evolution. Nominees have to improve the gene pool by eliminating themselves from the human race using  foolish methods. Worthy candidates have included a terrorist who unthinkingly opened his own letter bomb on its return after he posted it with insufficient stamps. Other examples include the man who shot himself in the head with a 'spy pen' weapon to show his friend it was real, and the thief attempting to purloin a steel cable from a lift shaft - and unbolted it while standing in the lift which then plummeted to the ground, killing him. Of 332 independently verified nominations, 14 were ruled out of the analysis because they were shared by male and females - usually adventurous couples in compromising positions. Of the 318 valid cases remaining, 282 (88.7 per cent) were awarded to males and just 36 to females, a gender difference entirely consistent with male idiot theory (MIT) that states men are idiots and idiots do stupid things. The award is named after Charles Darwin (left) due to his theory of evolution. Nominees have to improve the gene pool by eliminating themselves from the human race using foolish methods. Examples include the man who shot himself in the head with a 'spy pen' weapon to show his friend it was real (stock picture right) Writing in the British Medical Journal, the researchers said it is puzzling men are willing to take such unnecessary risks - simply as a rite of passage, in pursuit of male social esteem or solely in exchange for 'bragging rights'. Dr Dennis Lendrem, of the University of Newcastle, said: 'Idiotic risks are defined as senseless risks, where the apparent payoff is negligible or non existent, and the outcome is often extremely negative and often final. 'According to 'male idiot theory' (MIT) many of the differences in risk seeking behaviour, emergency department admissions, and mortality may be explained by the observation that men are idiots and idiots do stupid things. 'There are anecdotal data supporting MIT, but to date there has been no systematic analysis of sex differences in idiotic risk taking behaviour.' He said an honourable mention must go to the man who slipped when using a belt sander as an auto erotic device and lost a testicle. Repairing his scrotum with a staple gun, he was able to salvage his remaining testicle thus failing to eliminate himself completely from the gene pool, so he did not qualify for an award and was eliminated from the analysis. The researchers admitted the study has limitations because women may be more likely to nominate men for a Darwin Award, or the sex difference may reflect differences in alcohol use between men and women. But Dr Lendrem said: 'Despite these limitations there can be little doubt Darwin Award winners seem to make little or no real assessment of the risk or attempt at risk management. They just do it anyway. In some cases, the intelligence of the award winner may be questioned. 'For example, the office workers watching a construction worker demolishing a car park in the adjacent lot must have wondered about the man's intelligence. 'After two days of office speculation - how does he plan to remove the final support to crash the car park down safely? - they discovered, on the third day, that he didn't have a plan. The concrete platform collapsed, crushing him to death and flattening his mini-excavator.' He said anecdotal data support the hypothesis alcohol makes men feel 'bulletproof' after a few drinks, and it would be naïve to rule this out. Dr Lendrem Added: 'For example, the three men who played a variation on Russian roulette alternately taking shots of alcohol and then stamping on an unexploded Cambodian land mine. (Spoiler alert: the mine eventually exploded, demolishing the bar and killing all three men.)' The researchers believe MIT deserves further investigation, and, 'with the festive season upon us, we intend to follow up with observational field studies and an experimental study - males and females, with and without alcohol - in a semi-naturalistic Christmas party setting.'","Darwin Awards is an annual review of most foolish way people have died .

"Protesters seeking the immediate arrest of the Ferguson police officer who fatally shot unarmed teenager Michael Brown loudly disrupted another government meeting yesterday. The protests have renewed calls to remove the county prosecutor investigating the case involving the death of the black 18-year-old who was shot dead by Missouri police officer Darren Wilson. The demand for Wilson's arrest  began with the final utterance of the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of the St. Louis County Council meeting. When the pledge concluded with 'and justice for all, crowd members shouted 'For All', putting emphasis on the second word. Scroll down for video . St. Louis activist Anthony Shahid confronts councilman Steve Stenger during the St. Louis County Council . When the Pledge of Allegiance spoken at the start of the council meeting concluded with 'and justice for all, crowd members shouted 'For All', putting emphasis on the second word . A grand jury in Missouri has been given until January next year to decide whether Wilson acted criminally when he shot the teenager earlier this year. Brown was fatally shot August 9 after a confrontation that began when Darren Wilson asked him and a friend to walk on the sidewalk instead of the street. The grand jury was initially set to conclude its work on September 10, but a judge has extended its term until early next year, should the extra time be deemed necessary. A larger protest  took place a week ago at the Ferguson City Council's first meeting since Michael Brown's death. This was followed by unsuccessful efforts to block an interstate highway during rush hour in a demonstration that led to 35 arrests. There was also a weekend demonstration in downtown Ferguson linked to calls for a boycott of local businesses. Protest leaders said they plan to broaden their efforts with demonstrations at upcoming games hosted by the St. Louis Cardinals and the NFL's St. Louis Rams, who host the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. Protesters voice concerns at the meeting.

Protesters want county prosecutor Bob McCulloch to either step aside or for Gov. Jay Nixon to appoint a special prosecutor. They cite concerns about whether he could fairly oversee the case since his father was a police officer killed in the line of duty when McCulloch was a child, and he has many relatives who work in law enforcement. McCulloch, who has been the county's elected prosecutor for more than two decades, could have filed charges himself but chose to take the case to a grand jury to decide whether the use of lethal force was justified. A St. Louis County police officer 'wands' attorney Anthony Gray before allowing him into the council chambers . Police arrest a protester who refused to leave a protest aimed at shutting down Interstate 70 in Berkeley . Many of the nearly 40 speakers at the council meeting directed their scorn at Councilman Steve Stenger, who relied on McCulloch's endorsement  to defeat County Executive Charlie Dooley in a Democratic primary days before Brown's death. Stenger faces a Republican state lawmaker in the November general election. 'Don't vote for Stenger,' the crowd chanted. Other speakers gave Stenger an ultimatum to 'denounce' McCulloch no later than noon on Wednesday. The shouts, jeers and chants drowned out his attempts to speak at the meeting's outset. Demonstrators sit in the street after police prevented them from gaining access to Interstate Highway 70 . Hazel Erby, the council's lone black member, was the only other elected official to speak. She drew cheers when she told the demonstrators, 'I have to say I agree with you.' After the meeting, protesters had four and a half minutes of silence in the hallway to signify the four and a half hours that Brown's body lay in the street. They then briefly marched through downtown Clayton. McCulloch has previously said he expects the panel to complete its inquiry into Brown's shooting by next month.

"It may already be the most anticipated product in Apple's history - and for fans eagerly awaiting Apple's $349 Watch, there could be some good news on the way. A Taiwanese site has claimed that mass production of the watch is to begin in January. So far Apple has refused to reveal exactly when it will be released, although a statement made to Apple employees suggests the release will be in 'the spring.' Scroll down for video . Apple anticipates a total of 24 million watches will be shipped during 2015, according to claims - and mass production will start in January . The Apple Watch will use three types of app. Notifications allow users to take action or respond right from their wrist such as turning the lights off after they've left the house, quickly accessing flight details at the airport, and rerouting their transit when a train or bus is late. Glances, which quickly show users information they care about most, such as the latest news and sports scores, alarm system status or the next step of a favorite recipe. Full apps can use a developer's own interface. It has previously been claimed that suppliers were struggling to make enough screens and processors. However, breakthroughs have been made in the number of successful yields for the watch's display and processor, according to Taiwan's United Daily News. Unveiled on September 9 at Apple's iPhone 6 launch event, the Apple Watch is the company's foray into wearable computers. Samsung, LG, Motorola and Microsoft have already launched their own smartwatches, but Apple is expected to face unprecedented demand for its watch. Quanta, which is building the watch, has upped its number of workers from 2,000 to 10,000 and is ultimately aiming for 20,000. The initial round of shipments will be 3 to 5 million watches. Apple anticipates a total of 24 million watches to be shipped during 2015, G for Games said. According to 9to5Mac, Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail and online stores hinted at the release date when she told staff: 'We’re going into the holidays, we’ll go into Chinese New Year, and then we’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring.' Apple's chief executive Tim Cook unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. He didn't announce exactly when the watch would be available, but said it would go on sale 'early next year.' Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications . The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri also is built into the Apple Watch. A 'source close to Apple' told The Information last month that the firm 'would be lucky to ship [the watch] before Valentine's Day'. Chinese New Year falls on 19 February next year, so Ms Ahrendts comments push it at least beyond this date. Despite the range of impressive features unveiled by Mr Cook, there was something he failed to mention: battery life. The telling omission suggests the watch’s battery life will be the Achilles Heel of the device when it eventually does go on sale. Apple is said to be unhappy with the watch's battery life, and the long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. Although he didn't reveal battery life details, Mr Cook did spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging . Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as Pebble and MetaWatch, tend to last up to a week on a single charge. The closest Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch was saying that users would ‘charge it at night.’ During an interview in Bloomberg Business Week, Apple's senior vice president of operations Jeff WIlliams said: 'We want to make the best product in the world. 'One of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt, but nobody is wearing them.' The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent. A source said Apple is unhappy with the watch's battery life, according to Re/Code. Another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life ‘is about a day now.’ The watch has a completely new user interface (left), different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown' (right) presented by chief executive Tim Cook . The company's chief executive added the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent. The long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year . A spokesperson for Apple declined to provide battery details to MailOnline and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year. Like many of Apple’s other products, the Apple Watch appears to have a sealed back, which means the battery cannot be replaced. This suggests that the entire $349 (£216) device will have to be replaced, once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use. Another concern is the launch of the health and activity-tracking apps on the Apple Watch, which will rely on adequate battery life for round-the-clock monitoring. Companies including Fitbit and Withings have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too, monitoring sleep patterns through movements. However, if the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed . Companies including Fitbit and Withings have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too, monitoring sleep patterns through movements. However, if the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed by the gadget which Apple says will ‘motivate people to be more active and more healthy.’ Apple did, however, spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging. Apple’s silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature. The success of the device could hang on whether or not it manages to do it in time.","$349 Watch had been believed to be facing manufacturing problems with screens and processor delays .

"Crocodiles are a close living relatives of birds, but compared to their feathered cousins, they are stuck in the past, scientists claim. Both groups of animals share a common ancestor that lived around 240 million years ago, and also gave rise to the dinosaurs. But while birds quickly evolved after the demise of dinosaurs, the evolution of crocodilians has crawled along slowly. Crocodiles are a close living relatives of birds, but compared to their feathered cousins, they are stuck in the past, scientists claim. The reptiles evolved at a slow rate after the demise of dinosaurs and their 'body plan' has remained largely unchanged for millions of years, experts claim . Crocodilians make up the group of creatures that includes crocodiles, caimans, alligators and gharials. Now, new genetic studies have revealed their unusually slow rate of genetic evolution. The sluggish progress of the reptiles has helped scientists build up a genetic picture of the archosaurs that predated dinosaurs, pterosaurs, birds and crocodilians. Dr Richard Green, from the University of California at Santa Cruz, said: ‘The ticking of the molecular clock in the crocodilians is much slower than in other lineages we’re used to looking at, like mammals, which means we can see back into their past more cleanly. Both crocodiles and birds share a common ancestor called archosaurs (illustrated) that lived around 240 million years ago. This ancestor also gave rise to the dinosaurs . ‘We know from fossils that the body plan of crocs has remained largely unchanged for millions of years.’ The team sequenced the genomes, or genetic blueprints, of three crocodilian species: the American alligator, the saltwater crocodile, and the Indian gharial. The study, published in the journal Science, suggests that the ancestor of all archosaurs had an extremely slow rate of molecular evolution, which sped up in the bird lineage. After the meteor strike, which is thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, surviving birds experienced a rapid burst of evolution. After the meteor strike, which is thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, surviving birds experienced a rapid burst of evolution. This led to nearly all the species of birds seen on Earth today including Snow geese (pictured), of which there are more than 10,000 . This led to nearly all the species of birds seen on Earth today, of which there are more than 10,000. In related studies, also reported in Science, researchers compared the genomes of 48 bird species selected from all major avian groups, including the woodpecker, owl, penguin, hummingbird and flamingo. They discovered that birdsong evolved independently at least twice. Birds were also found to have lost their teeth around 116 million years ago, when the dinosaurs still ruled. Prehistoric crocodiles were able to run around like dogs to escape the jaws of predatory dinosaurs. This is according to a study published last year that showed, for the first time, how the reptiles evolved in a dinosaur dominated world. Today, most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish, but their ancestors ran around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean, imitating the behaviour of whales. Today, most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish. But their ancestors (pictuerd) were very different creatures, with some running around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean, imitating the behaviour of whales . The study, by Bristol University, revealed how the jaws of the ancient crocodiles evolved to enable the fierce animals to survive in vastly different environments. The team examined variation in the shape and biomechanics function of the lower jaws in over 100 ancient crocodiles during the Mesozoic - a period which began 251 million years ago and covered over 170 million years. The study revealed that ancient crocodiles invaded the Jurassic seas and evolved jaws built primarily for water efficiency to capture agile prey, such as fish. Sample of jaws from the Mesozoic crocodile record . The research also found that variation peaked again in the Cretaceous period- 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food. The research also found that variation peaked again in the Cretaceous period- 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food. After the devastating end-Triassic extinction event, crocodile ancestors invaded the seas and evolved jaws primarily built to efficiently swim in the water to catch agile prey such as fish. They also evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes during the Cretaceous Period - about 145 million to 65 million years ago - as they adapted to a diverse range of niches and environments alongside the dinosaurs, including eating plants. Surprisingly, the lower jaws of Cretaceous crocodiles did not have a huge amount of variation. Instead, the fossil record points towards novel adaptations in other areas of their anatomy, such as armadillo-like body armour.","University of California at Santa Cruz Experts studied crocodile genes .

Sailson Jose das Gracas, 26, told police in Rio de Janeiro he would go out 'on the hunt' for white women after studying each victims for up to a month. In an unreported reign of terror spanning nine years, Gracas claims to have murdered 37 women, two men and one two-year-old child in the outlying area of Rio de Janeiro known as Baixada Fluminense. Scroll down for video . Sailson Jose das Gracas, 26, told police in Rio de Janeiro he would go out 'on the hunt' for white women after studying each victims for up to a month . He told police: 'I would watch the victim, study her. I would wait a month, sometimes a week, depending on the place. I would get to know where she lived, how her family were, if she passed by on the street, I would watch, have a look at her house, studying her. 'In the early hours of the morning, I'd get through a gap in her house, really easily, and take advantage.' In an interview in front of TV cameras at the police station in Nova Iguacu, Garcas said he found pleasure in seeing the life drain out of the women he murdered. He said: 'I would stop in the bakery, or in a square, reading a newspaper. I would look at a woman and say to myself, ""it's that one"". 'I would follow her to her house, but I never raped anyone. Women for me has to be white, not black, because of my colour. ' I got pleasure from them fighting, screaming and scratching me. I thought that I was crazy, sometimes normal.' Chillingly, Garcas admitted he had become 'addicted' to murder. In an unreported reign of terror spanning nine years, Gracas claims to have murdered 37 women, two men and one two-year-old child in the outlying area of Rio de Janeiro (pictured) known as Baixada Fluminense . 'The first woman I killed I strangled with my hands. I felt pleasure, I liked it. I felt a very strong desire. I've already killed 38 women, I'm addicted,' he said. He also told camera he was eleven when he lost his father, who was electrocuted during an accident at work. He said: 'It marked me a lot. But that wasn't the reason why I committed these crimes.'

He said: 'On occasions, he killed his victims and masturbated on seeing them with their eyes open.' Police chief Pedro Henrique Medina, from the Baixada Fluminense Homicide Division, said Gracas voluntarily confessed to the murders have being caught in the act of murdering his latest victim. He said he believed his testimony because only the author of the crimes could recall them in so much detail. He said: 'His desire to kill was for women, and he didn't kill black women, just white. He followed the victim, studied her step by step until he managed to commit the crime.' Gracas was arrested after stabbing to death a 26-year-old woman identified as Fatima Miranda, in her home in the town of Nova Iguaçu, Greater Rio de Janeiro. During the investigation into her death, police officers arrested Gracas and two other people, Cleusa Blabina and Jose Messias, who were with Ms Miranda on the night of her death. The three were arrested after giving contradictory versions of what happened when questioned by police. After they were taken to the police station, Gracas admitted that he had been paid by the other two accomplices to murder Ms Miranda. He also admitted killing two men for money, and then detailed the dozens of other women he had murdered for his own pleasure in his serial killing spree. Gracas claimed commiting murder would help him 'calm down'. He said: 'When I didn't do it, I'd become nervous, I'd pace up and down inside the house. And when I'd done it I'd become calmer. I'd do a victim, and I could stay two months without doing it, or three. I'd stay fine, I'd just be thinking of that one that I'd killed. Then I'd go out on the hunt. 'I didn't kill worrying about going to jail. I did everything well, it's because I really like it doing it. I was most concerned with fingerprints, or if the place had a camera. I wouldn't take any documents with me so I wouldn't leave any clues for the police.' During his testimony Gracas also confessed to killing a two-year-old child because he was afraid her cries might wake up neighbours after he had killed her mother. He said his taste for murder began as a teenager. He said: 'I started to steal small things, do small robberies. And as I grew up I started having other thoughts. My thinking started to change, understand? From robbing, I started to think about killing. Aged 15, I stole handbags. After that, aged 17, I killed the first person. 'It gave me that adreneline rush, the first woman. And I thought about jail. Will I get caught? The things flowed well. So I started thinking about doing it more and more. And I liked it and started to get used to it.' Chillingly, Gracas claimed he did not regret any of the murders. Tiago Henrique Gomes da Rocha, another Brazilian, confessed to murdering at least 39 people in just three years . He said: 'I have no regrets, no. For me what I did is done. I wouldn't change anything, I don't regret anything. If I leave prison in 10, 15 or 20 years, I'll start doing the same thing again. It's my will, there's no other way. I leave, choose my 'women', the women I like to choose, and if I think that it has to be, it will.' According to police records, Sailson was arrested twice in 2007 for robbery and theft, carrying illegal firearms in February 2010 and theft again in February this year. But his murders remained undiscovered until today. Police have now launched an investigation into Gracas' claims and are calling on families of murder victims over the last nine years to get in touch. Rocha began killing in 2011, at first targeting homeless people, gays and prostitutes . Gracas spent last night in a police cell and will be transferred to a maximum security jail in Rio de Janeiro today. His arrest comes after Tiago Henrique Gomes da Rocha, another Brazilian, confessed to murdering at least 39 people in just three years . Rocha, 26, was arrested in October after being pulled over in the city of Goiania, when local police found he was facing trial for stealing a motorcycle's license plate in January. He was stopped while riding with fake plates on the motorcycle he often used during the murders, when he would drive by and attack random victims before speeding away. A day later, he confessed to killing 39 people — 15 young women as well as prostitutes and random people he thought to be gay or homeless. In a sick twist, it has been revealed that Rocha was in a romantic relationship with a pretty church girl with long hair, her appearance similar to that of his victims, the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported. Rocha began killing in 2011, at first targeting homeless people, gays and prostitutes. His first victim was a man, the first of 17 males he would eventually kill. This year, he turned his attention to young women. The list of the 15 most prolific modern serial killers is topped by Colombian Luis Garavito, a child murderer and rapist known as 'La Bestia' or 'The Beast.' He is thought to have killed more than 400 people, mostly street children. His proven victim count is 138. Pedro Rodrigues Filho, Brazil's most prolific killer, claimed to have killed more than 100 victims, 47 of them inmates. He was convicted of killing 71 people. He killed his first two victims at the age of 14 and murdered his father and ate a piece of his heart.","Sailson Jose das Gracas, 26, was arrested for stabbing a woman to death .

"A major new study of American workers and their sleep patterns has recommended later start times to improve on health. Experts said 'delaying the morning start time of work,' or making it flexible, could have a major effect. They found that for every hour that work was delayed, people got 20 minutes more sleep. Experts said 'delaying the morning start time of work,' or making it flexible, could have a major effect. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 30 percent of employed U.S. adults typically sleep 6 hours or less in a 24-hour period, which represents approximately 40.6 million workers. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends that adults get about 7 to 9 hours of nightly sleep for optimal health, productivity and daytime alertness. After analyzing results from 124,517 American adults on their sleep and work habits, as recorded in the American Time Use Surveys from 2003 to 2011, lead author Dr. Mathias Basner of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and colleagues found an association between earlier starting times for work or school and less time spent sleeping. 'Results show that with every hour that work or educational training started later in the morning, sleep time increased by approximately 20 minutes,' the researchers said. 'Respondents slept an average of only 6 hours when starting work before or at 6 a.m. and 7:29 hours when starting work between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.' The new study shows that paid work time is the primary waking activity exchanged for sleep and suggests that chronic sleep loss potentially could be prevented by strategies that make work start times more flexible. Results show that work is the dominant activity exchanged for less sleep across practically all categories. Compared to normal sleepers, short sleepers who reported sleeping 6 hours or less worked 1.55 more hours on weekdays and 1.86 more hours on weekends or holidays, and they started working earlier in the morning and stopped working later at night. The highest odds of being a short sleeper were found among adults working multiple jobs, who were 61 percent more likely than others to report sleeping 6 hours or less on weekdays. Respondents who were unemployed, retired or absent from the labour force also obtained significantly more sleep and were less likely to be short sleepers. 'The evidence that time spent working was the most prominent sleep thief was overwhelming,' said lead author Dr. Mathias Basner, assistant professor of sleep and chronobiology in psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. Short sleepers also traveled more, started traveling earlier in the morning, and stopped later in the evening than normal sleepers. The travel pattern, with peaks at 7 a.m. and 5 p.m., strongly suggests that the majority of travel time is associated with commuting. According to Basner, the results point to several possible solutions for workers' lack of sleep. 'Potential intervention strategies to decrease the prevalence of chronic sleep loss in the population include greater flexibility in morning work and class start times, reducing the prevalence of multiple jobs, and shortening morning and evening commute times,' he said. Short sleepers also traveled more, started traveling earlier in the morning, and stopped later in the evening than normal sleepers. Results show that with every hour that work or educational training started later in the morning, sleep time increased by approximately 20 minutes. Self-employed respondents with more flexible work times also obtained significantly more sleep than private sector employees and were 17 percent less likely to be a short sleeper. Study results are published in the December issue of the journal Sleep. 'Getting at least seven hours of nightly sleep is essential to be at your mental, emotional and physical best for whatever you will pour yourself into, either at work or at home,' said American Academy of Sleep Medicine President Dr. Timothy Morgenthaler, who was not involved in the study.","Every hour that work was delayed, people got 20 minutes more sleep .

"In 2016, a team of engineers will attempt to smash the land speed record by reaching more than 1,000mph in their Bloodhound supersonic car (SSC). The project has been seven years in the making and has been a dream of former RAF pilot Andy Green since he set the current record in 1997. Now, it has moved a step closer to reality - with the hybrid rocket engine them car will use being fired for the first time. Scroll down for video and to see the Car's cockpit . The supersonic car will use one Nammo hybrid rocket in high speed testing scheduled for 2015 and a cluster of three rockets in its 1,000mph (1,609 km/h) campaign in 2016. The firing lasted for a predefined 16 seconds, producing a maximum thrust of 30 kN (or 3 tons). A hybrid rocket combines a liquid oxidizer (hydrogen peroxide) and a solid fuel (synthetic rubber) to allow the rocket to be throttled or shut off, a feature beyond the capabilities of traditional solid rockets. The test burn lasted for 16 seconds and produced 30 kN (kiloNewtons) or 3 tons of thrust. Temperature inside the rocket reached 2,200 degrees celsius and 1,200 degrees in the plume, more commonly known as the massive jet of flame shooting out the end. The test, conducted by the Bloodhound team's rocket partner Nammo tests the first in a series of large hybrid rocket motors at their Norwegian test site. The supersonic car will use one Nammo hybrid rocket in high speed testing scheduled for 2015 and a cluster of three rockets in its 1,000mph (1,609 km/h) campaign in 2016. This is addition to main the main engine, which is normally found powering a Eurofighter Typhoon, weighs a tonne and produces 20,000lbs (90kN) - or nine tonnes of thrust. The two power plants together produce 135,000 thrust horse power, or the equivalent to 180 Formula 1 cars. The test firing of the rocket was an unprecedented success, the team said. The firing lasted for a predefined 16 seconds, producing a maximum thrust of 30 kN (or 3 tons). The rocket will also be used to power spacecraft. Nammo’s work with hybrid technology has been supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) since 2010, notably under its Future Launchers Preparatory Programme (FLPP). Driver Andy Green, 51, is hoping to break the world land speed record when he tests the £10 million rocket-powered vehicle next year. The upper chassis is made of strong, but lightweight aluminium, onto which titanium stringers and titanium skin will be fixed using glue and 1,400 aircraft specification rivets. The lower chassis, below the jet, is made of aluminium and steel, and houses the Nammo hybrid rocket. The pencil-shaped car will be 44ft (13.4m) long, 6ft (183cm) in diameter, and weigh 7.5 tonnes when completed. Chief engineer Mark Chapman said: 'For us at Bloodhound, it is immensely exciting, this is the motor that's going to take us to break the record. 'For us this is a really important test. The SSC stands for ‘SuperSonic Car’. The vehicle has four wheels and is powered by both the newly-fitted jet engine and a rocket. It is set to travel at 1,000mph (1,600km/h). The slender body, 44 feet (14 metres) long, keeps the entire vehicle aerodynamic. The pencil-shaped car (concept pictured) will be 44ft (13.4m) long, 6ft (183cm) in diameter and weigh 7.5 tonnes when completed. The upper chassis is made of strong, but lightweight aluminium to which titanium stringers and titanium skin will be fixed using glue and 1,400 aircraft specification rivets . It weighs just over seven tonnes and the engines will produce more than 135,000 horsepower. That’s more than six times the power of all the cars on a Formula 1 starting grid put together. In the coming years the vehicle will begin test runs at lower speeds before attempting to set a new land speed record. The current land speed record stands at 763.035mph (1,227.985km/h), set by former RAF pilot Andy Green - who will also drive the Bloodhound - back in 1997 in the ThrustSSC. The project is on course for the finished car to roll out for low speed testing at up to 200mph (321km/h) at Newquay’s Aerohub next summer. The team will then head to South Africa and attempt to break the 1,000mph barrier on a purpose-built 12-mile track in the desert in 2015 and 2016. During the record-chasing run, Bloodhound will cover 12 miles (19km) in two minutes, exerting an acceleration force of almost 2G, and peak deceleration force of 3G on the driver. The current land speed record stands at 763.035mph (1,227.985km/h), set by former RAF pilot Andy Green - who will also drive the Bloodhound - back in 1997 in the ThrustSSC. Earlier this year, designers of the supersonic car revealed the vehicle’s futuristic cockpit. It has been made from five different types of carbon fibre weave, and two different resins. It has taken more than 10,000 hours to design and manufacture in total. The project is on course for the finished car to roll out for low speed testing at up to 200mph (321km/h) at Newquay’s Aerohub next summer. The team behind the Bloodhound SSC also revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000mph (1,600km/h) to zero. After the car reaches its top speed, air brakes and parachutes slow it to 160mph (260km/h). Breaking to this speed is done at a constant 3G deceleration - equivalent to going from 60mph (95km/h) in a normal car to zero in just one second - for 20 seconds. At this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute. Attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car-like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this, so the team needed a new approach. Instead, they switched to steel rotors. In tests, these could withstand temperatures of up to 850°C (1,560°F), and be used again. The next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced. Sandwiched between the layers of carbon fibre are three different thicknesses of aluminium honeycomb core, which provide additional strength. At its thickest point the material is made up of 13 layers, but measures just 0.9-inches (24mm) thick. The cockpit structure weighs 441lbs (200kg) and bolts directly to the metallic rear chassis carrying the jet, rocket and racing car engine. It has to be strong as this front section will have to endure peak aerodynamic loads of up to three tonnes per square metre at 1,000mph (1,609kph), as well the considerable forces generated by the front wheels and suspension. It will also carry ballistic armour to protect Wing Commander Green should a stone be thrown up by the front wheels at very high speeds. The cockpit is positioned in front of three loud motors - the jet, a cluster of hybrid rockets and the racing car engine that drives the rocket’s oxidiser pump, which are expected to generate a noise level estimated at 140 decibels - the equivalent to a shotgun blast. Wing Commander Green will wear a specially made in-ear communications system to protect his hearing and to ensure that he can communicate with mission control. The team behind the Bloodhound SSC also revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000mph (1,600km/h) to zero.

Breaking to this speed is done at a constant 3G deceleration - equivalent to going from 60mph (95km/h) in a normal car to zero in just one second - for 20 seconds. This last stint to zero is where the problem lies, however. Even at this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute. Attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car-like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this, so the team needed a new approach. Instead, they switched to steel rotors from brake manufacturer AP Racing. In tests these proved much more promising, withstanding temperatures of up to 850°C (1,560°F). They even survived to such an extent that they can be used again. The next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced.

"In its continuing bid to take on TV networks, Netflix is busy preparing a slew of original programming. To date, the site has already released eight series that are available only on the digital platform. And this week, the company announced it hopes to have up to 20 original series running alongside its other shows and movies. The California-based company has announced plans for more original shows. Speaking at a conference in New York, chief content officer Theodore Sarandos said the site would unveil about 20 shows for the platform in the next five years . The announcement was made by chief content officer Theodore Sarandos in a conference in New York earlier this week. He was reported as saying, by Seeking Alpha, that Netflix wants to expand its original programming to ‘as many as 20 original series’. This is apparently a move to try and replicate the success of channels such as HBO. Mr Sarandos said the idea was to launch an ‘original season of content every two and a half weeks’ to get into a ‘regular drumbeat with consumer expectation.’ Earlier this year Netflix agreed to pay Verizon to ensure its video streams receive priority over the ISPs network. It comes amid growing concern over ISPs plans to throttle high-bandwidth services such as Netflix - and claims from Netflix boss Reed Hastings that payments are an 'arbitrary tax'. The deal came just weeks after a similar agreement with Comcast was revealed. But it quickly paid off for Comcast subscribers, and figures showed Netflix's videos streamed through Comcast's Internet service at their highest speeds in 17 months. He continued that this doesn’t necessarily mean a new show for everybody, but rather new shows for different ‘segments of the viewership every couple of weeks.’ Netflix is also planning to release more original movies, which include a sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon next year - subtitled ‘The Green Destiny’. The move follows news earlier in the year that Yahoo is also making its own original TV shows. The first of these will be comedies titled Other Space and Sin City Saints, and they will be shown on the Yahoo website, mobile app, Apple TV and Roku devices. The series, which launch in 2016, will be available free to be viewers. And beginning in the summer of 2015, Yahoo is also planning to stream one live concert every day through a partnership with Live Nation. The expansion makes Yahoo one of the latest technology companies to mount a challenge to Netflix. Microsoft, Amazon, Hulu and Wuaki are among the other companies angling for a piece of the growing audience watching video piped over high-speed internet connections. The shows will cater to a variety of tastes, with new shows being shown every two weeks. They will complement the site's existing original series like House of Cards (shown), which stars Kevin Spacey. Netflix is also planning original movies including a Crouching Tiger sequel . Netflix’s move follows news earlier in the year that Yahoo will also release its own original TV shows in 2016 (chief executive Marissa Mayer shown).

"Microsoft is set to show off the next major version of its Windows software at a January event at its Redmond HQ - but admits its release has already been delayed until fall 2015. Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner told Japanese news service Nikkei on Wednesday that the new system would be released 'early next fall.' Microsoft has not publicly set a firm timetable for the release of Windows 10, but only last week suggested the possibility of an earlier release. Scroll down for video . Earlier this year Terry Myerson, Microsoft's Windows chief, explained how the new software will work on everything from a desktop computer to a smartphone - and even the firm's XBox One games console . New operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever'. Various app stores merged into one platform, called the One Store. Return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8. Users can create multiple desktops to keep things organised. The keynote from the day-long event on January 21 will be live streamed. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Windows execs Terry Myerson and Joe Belfiore, and Xbox chief Phil Spencer will be speaking. The event will focus on the 'Windows 10 consumer experience,' a spokesperson confirmed. Earlier this year Microsoft was derided for 'missing one' when it announced  it has decided to jump straight to version 10 of its Windows software in a bid to convince consumers the software is different from current versions. The firm announced the latest version of its Windows operating system, called Windows 10, at an event in San Francisco. The firm admitted the software was 'at a threshold' after the poorly received Windows 8. Terry Myerson, Microsoft's Windows chief said: 'There's about one and a half billion people using Windows today. 'Devices outnumber people. 'Windows is at a threshold and now it's time for a new Windows. 'Our new Windows must be built from the ground up for a mobile first, cloud first world. 'It wouldn't be right to call it Windows 9.' Microsoft says the new operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever' and sees the companies various app stores merged into one platform, called the One Store. Windows 10 marks the return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8. The new Start Menu has the traditional list layout of previous versions of the interface, combined with the tile set-up that Microsoft introduced in Windows 8. The new software will also allow users on hybrid devices like the Surface Pro tablet will be able to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes, with Microsoft demonstrating how the interface will change as you do. The new Start Menu has the traditional list layout of previous versions of the interface, combined with the tile set-up that Microsoft introduced in Windows 8. Mr Belfiore demonstrated how the new tiles in the new menu can be personalised and re-sized. This will cover all of the company's smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. Myerson said Windows 10 will be 'a whole new generation' and, as expected, will work across a variety of devices - from phones to gaming consoles. It also marks the return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8. In addition to offering a list of the user's favourite applications, the menu also brings up resizable tiles - similar to those featured in Windows 8's touch-centric interface - on PCs and tablets. The current version, Windows 8, has been widely derided for forcing radical behavioral changes. Microsoft is restoring some of the more traditional ways of doing things and promises that Windows 10 will be familiar for users regardless of which version of Windows they are now using. 'Windows 10 will deliver the right experience, at the right time. 'Windows 10 will be our most comprehensive platform, ever,' said Mr Myerson. 'We're delivering one application platform. One store, one way for applications to be discovered, purchased, and updated across all of these devices.' The firm announced the latest version of its Windows operating system, called Windows 10, at an event in San Francisco. It will run on tablets, phones , desktop computers and even the firm's Xbox games console. The technology giant had been expected to announce an update to its flagship Windows software after the previous upgrade, Windows 8, which saw a major overhaul of the interface and functionality, received mixed reviews within the user community. Microsoft says its new version of Windows will be 'familiar' and compatible with existing management systems already in use around the world. Mr Myerson also announced the launch of the Windows Insider Program, which will allow Microsoft fans and users to get early versions of the new software and become part of the development team by testing Windows 10 and suggesting improvements. Industry experts have been having their say on Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows 10, which has been announced at an event in California. Many see the upgrade as being the first steps towards righting the unpopular changes made in the company's previous desktop software, Windows 8, and that is reflected in industry reaction. Stuart Miles, founder of technology website Pocket Lint said: 'The initial reaction is that Microsoft had introduced some really good features that will appeal to many and fix many of the annoyances of Windows 8. 'It looks like they are doing everything they can to make amends for the mistakes of Windows 8, but with a long lead time and many unanswered questions like release and price, there is still much left to learn. 'That said it looks to be a good move from the Redmond based company and one that will benefit many.' Geoff Blaber of technology analysts CCS Insights also noted the need for Microsoft to regain support after Windows 8. 'Windows 10 is the product of a difficult Windows 8 launch and a process of refinement based on vocal user feedback. Microsoft will hope that this marks a fresh start that will convince developers, enterprise and consumers of its One Windows strategy', he said. 'With Windows 10 Microsoft has re-evaluated its approach to software releases by adopting a web mentality that dovetails with the Cloud first, mobile first vision under Satya Nadella. This open, collaborative approach is critical if Microsoft is to overcome the wave of negative sentiment that has plagued Windows 8 since launch. 'The unveiling of Windows 10 is notable for its emphasis on enterprise. This dialling up of corporate versus consumer functionality is much needed not least because enterprise replacements are driving PC market growth. 'Developers are the lifeblood of any platform so it is critical that Microsoft's 'One Windows' mantra delvers on the promise and re-energises developer engagement.' The service will launch tomorrow. 'We're inviting our enthusiastic fans to evaluate it with us. 'We know they're a vocal bunch.' Windows 10 was confirmed to launch 'later in the year in 2015'. The new software is designed to bring together all of Microsoft's different hardware, such as a the surface tablet (left) and the Xbox One (right) under the same software. Across desktop PCs as a whole, only 13.4% currently run Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, according to research firm NetMarketshare. By contrast, it says 51.2% are powered by Windows 7 and 23.9% by Windows XP, a version that is no longer supported by Microsoft. For instance, the start menu in Windows 10 will appear similar to what's found in Windows 7, but tiles opening to the side will resemble what's found in Windows 8. Joe Belfiore, a Microsoft executive who oversees Windows design and evolution, said Windows 10 will offer 'the familiarity of Windows 7 with some of the benefits that exist in Windows 8' to help business users make the transition. Belfiore said that the company was going 'back to basics' with Windows 10, and confirmed that the famous Start menu, which was removed from Windows 8, would be returning. 'We're looking to find the balance, so that all the Windows 7 users get a familiar experience on the devices they already have,' he said. 'It gives the familiarity of Windows 7 with some of the elements of Windows 8.' He said that going from Windows 8 to Windows 10 is like going from a Prius to a Tesla. 'They don't have to learn any new way to drive.' Mr Belfiore also confirmed that Windows 10 would be compatible with both traditional and touch-based device users like tablets through a new task view with buttons scaled up so that they're more friendly to those on touchscreen devices. Users on hybrid devices like the Surface Pro tablet will be able to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes, with Microsoft demonstrating how the interface will change as you do. Although the new software won't be formally released until next year, analysts already consider its success crucial for Microsoft and new CEO Satya Nadella. Users can also create multiple desktops to keep things organized . The new software represents an attempt to step back from the radical redesign that alienated many PC users when Windows 8 was introduced two years ago. However, it is not a complete retreat from Microsoft's goal of bridging the gap between PCs and mobile devices: It still has touch-screen functions and strives to create a familiar experience for Windows users who switch between desktop computers, tablets and smartphones. Microsoft currently has three main systems - Windows 8 for traditional computers and tablets, Windows Phone 8 for cellphones and Xbox for its gaming console. By unifying the underlying systems, software developers will be able to create apps for the various devices more easily. Consumers will also be able to switch devices more easily and avoid having to buy the same apps multiple times. The Bill Gates-founded company is pushing to challenge the likes of Apple across multiple platforms, but remains the market leader when it comes to desktop computing. The company has also launched a Windows Phone and Windows-powered tablet, the Surface, in recent years as they look to challenge the iPhone and iPad, as well as Google's Android platform.","Microsoft will show off software for first time on January 21st in Seattle .

"Former Tottenham forward Les Ferdinand has made the stunning revelation that coaches at the club used to motivate Mousa Dembele by telling him he could earn a move away if he played well. The Belgian midfielder played 90 minutes as Mauricio Pochettino's side lost 1-0 to Besiktas in Istanbul. But Ferdinand felt the 27-year-old could have offered more, admitting he struggled to motivate the Belgian midfielder while working as a coach in north London. Mousa Dembele played 90 minutes as Mauricio Pochettino's side lost 1-0 to Besiktas in Istanbul . Les Ferdinand revealed a bizarre technique Spurs coaches used to motivate Dembele when he worked there . Speaking on ITV, he said: 'We used to watch him in (Tottenham's) training - every time he gets the ball he wants someone to challenge him and he gets past them but just passes it sideways. 'He's got great ability you just don't see enough of it. He leaves you frustrated because you know he's got more and you want to see it.

"It is not often a player will celebrate a success for their closest rivals, but Chelsea’s Gary Cahill appeared delighted that Manchester City had made it through to the knockout stages of the Champions League. Before beating Roma, City were facing not only the prospect of exiting the competition but finishing bottom of their group and not even having Europa League consolation. City are also lurking just three points behind Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League despite the Blues’ 23-match unbeaten run, which was ended last weekend by Newcastle. So Cahill saw much to be pleased about. Chelsea centre back Gary Cahill, in action against Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday, is glad City progressed . ‘Maybe City would have rested players (had they gone out) or maybe they would have had more time to prepare for games,’ Cahill said after Chelsea’s 3-1 win over Sporting Lisbon that made them the highest scoring team in the Champions League group stages with 17 goals. ‘Who knows if that will have any impact in the league?’ Chelsea have made themselves the team to beat this season, crushing opponents in that undefeated run which included victories against Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham and draws away to both Manchester clubs. Manager Jose Mourinho has even claimed that some teams up their game against Chelsea while treating matches against other opponents as though they are friendlies. Cahill celebrates after his header was turned in by John Mikel Obi during Chelsea's 3-1 win against Sporting . Samir Nasri celebrates his screamer of a goal on Wednesday as Manchester City won 2-0 at Roma . But 15 games into the Premier League campaign City — who have lost to Stoke, West Ham and Newcastle already — are still hanging in there, waiting to strike. Cahill has called it right. Chelsea are still fighting on four fronts — Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and Capital One Cup. If City had just the FA Cup and Premier League to play for, they would be a different, more threatening, proposition. ‘You see how close City are to us even with that unbeaten run,’ Cahill added. ‘We think about that — how hard we worked and how well everyone spoke about how we were playing but yet we’re three points in front with many games to go.’ Germany international Andre Schurrle celebrates Chelsea's second against Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday . Last season, Chelsea were 46 minutes away from the Champions League final but three goals from Atletico Madrid sent them out. Cahill has experienced winning the Champions League with Chelsea — six months after joining in January 2012 — as well as being knocked out at the group stage with 10 points and that agonising defeat by Atletico. ‘Last year we were close but I feel that we’re going stronger this season,’ he said. ‘As a team we’ve got more experience than last season. It hurt us a lot to go out in the semi-final.’","Manchester City beat Roma 2-0 to reach the Champions League last 16 .

"Georgetown became the first college sports team to stage an 'I Can't Breathe' T-shirt demonstration to protest the chokehold death of Eric Garner. The entire basketball team emerged for the final warmups before their loss to No. 10 Kansas in Washington DC on Wednesday night wearing black short-sleeve T-shirts with the three words in bold white letters. The players wore the T-shirts during the national anthem while lined up across the court. They then shook hands with the Jayhawks before taking off the shirts for the announcement of the starting lineups. Scroll down for video . Members of the Georgetown basketball team stand for the National Anthem wearing 'I Can't Breathe' t-shirts before an NCAA college basketball game against Kansas . A number of professional athletes, including LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, have written the message on their warmups or other equipment over the past few days. The message echoes the last words spoken by Eric Garner as police were attempting to arrest him in New York in July, and has become a rallying cry at protests across the United States. Last week, a Staten Island grand jury had decided not to indict white NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo for his role in  Garner's death last July, sparking demonstrations across the country. The protests crossed the Atlantic Thursday, as demonstrators staged a mass die-in at Westfield shopping centre in London, in solidarity with the recent events surrounding the deaths Eric Garner and Michael Brown - the black teenager shot dead in Ferguson. Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James warms up before an NBA basketball game against the Brooklyn Nets at the Barclays Center wearing a T-shirt with the protest message . After the game in Washington DC, Hoyas coach John Thompson III gave a detailed, eloquent explanation for the T-shirts. He said it was a player-driven idea that had its origins after the team watched the grand jury decision concerning Michael Brown  live on television while in the Bahamas for a holiday tournament. Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers on the court before a game against the Sacramento Kings . The coach said the players initially wanted to wear the shirts at the  previous game, but he first wanted to have more conversations with them to make sure they all understood the answer to the question: 'Why do you want to wear this shirt?' 'You can go from Patrick Ewing wearing a T-shirt underneath his jersey, then it becomes something that everyone does,' Thompson III said. 'Allen Iverson braiding his hair and playing in the league, then it becomes something everyone does. Kobe wearing the tights and then everyone does it. 'And this isn't that. This isn't one of those things where you go along just because it's something that's trending. 'We have had a lot of discussions, and the emotions as it relates to the protest the guys wanted to do today, the emotions and the feelings in the locker room are all over the place, meaning not necessarily everyone feels the same way. He added: 'The emotions are from fear to frustration to confusion to anger, and the reasons why every individual wanted to wear it is all over the place, too, which is probably pretty consistent with the emotions across the country right now. 'I think the group wanted to possibly put ourselves in the position to be a part of a process, to help where there's positive change, as opposed to just negative reactions.' Junior guard D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera referenced the names of Brown and Trayvon Martin as he spoke about the protest, saying it goes beyond one case in New York. 'We really wanted to represent those families that all lost (a loved) one,' he said. The entire basketball team emerged for the final warmups before their loss to No. 10 Kansas in Washington DC on Wednesday night wearing black short-sleeve T-shirts with the three words in bold white letters . Senior center Joshua Smith: 'We didn't wear the shirts to say that the cops were wrong or the system was wrong. 'We just wore the shirts just to show our condolences to the family because no matter how you look at it, we don't know who was right or wrong, but they still lost somebody. And they won't get that person back.' Thompson III's father, longtime Hoyas coach John Thompson Jr., was known for taking bold positions during a his career, especially in support of minorities. Most famously, the elder Thompson walked off the court before a home game in 1989 to protest NCAA Proposition 42, which restricted the criteria under which athletes could receive scholarships. When Thompson III was asked about his father's legacy of speaking his mind, the elder Thompson spoke up from the back of the room. Georgetown guard Jabril Trawick, left,  wears an 'I Can't Breathe' t-shirt during warm ups before NCAA college basketball game against Kansas . 'It's a (expletive) school, man,' Thompson Jr. said. 'That's your responsibility to deal with things like that. We're not a ... damn pro team.' Kansas freshman guard Kelly Oubre was impressed by the Georgetown players' stand. 'That's definitely a powerful statement that those guys collectively made,' Oubre said. 'I respect them for doing that, and they did it all as a team, too, so it was something good to watch.' Jayhawks coach Bill Self did not see the protest because he was focused on preparing for the game, but he also supported the players' action. 'It's a pretty strong stance,' he said. 'And I think it's pretty good, and it certainly shows a lot of solidarity amongst their unit. And I don't see anything negative with it at all.'

"An unedifying end to Group D provided Celtic with a simple lesson. Defend even remotely as poorly as this and their Europa League campaign will end at the last-32 stage. Ronny Deila had hoped to see positive signs for the future from this pressure-free dead rubber played amid a ghostly ambience. Instead, the lifeless way the Parkhead side went about combating Dinamo’s attacking threats provided cause for much head-scratching concern. The Croats are hardly a continental force. Whichever side comes out of the hat in Monday’s draw for the first knockout round will possess significantly superior quality. But Deila’s men allowed them to every opportunity to impress — with full-back Adam Matthews having a particularly lamentable evening — and that hospitality was warmly accepted. Marko Pjaca claimed a hat-trick for the hosts, while Marcelo Brozovic also found a way past Craig Gordon. It should be noted that, once again, the goalkeeper was Celtic’s best player in a European outing, notching a clutch of worthy saves to prevent the scoreline swelling further.

Scorers: Commons 23', Scepovic 29', Pivaric 81' (og) Referee: Gediminas Mazeika (Lithuania) All in all, this was pretty shambolic fare with a string of faintly comical concessions at both ends of the field. There were times when Dinamo entered into a pact of non-defending. Kris Commons and Stefan Scepovic were on target as Celtic briefly led during the first half. An own goal from Josip Pivaric then gave the Scottish champions hope of avoiding a fifth European defeat of the season but it ultimately went unfulfilled. Yes, there were changes to Deila’s line-up with only prize money and co-efficient points at stake. But they were all in more advanced areas. Those at the back will have to do better – much, much better – if Celtic are to keep an edge of glamour to their campaign come the spring. Having also conceded three to Red Bull Salzburg in their previous Europa League outing, Deila may now view defensive reinforcement as a rising priority come the January window. Maybe it was case of playing down to the surroundings, given that the Maksimir Stadium provided swathes of empty blue seats as a backdrop. The dismal attendance wasn’t solely down to the inconsequential nature of proceedings, as Dinamo’s hardcore fans have been calling for a boycott in protest at the direction their club has taken. A haul of three points from their opening five Group D games also led to a demand for a public apology from the players. It has not been a happy camp. More than 1,000 Celtic fans had made the trek to Croatia, presumably having booked up in anticipation of this being a decisive contest. They at least added a little pocket of noise to an otherwise eerie atmosphere, although the sight of a flare being lit at kick-off was unwelcome given the club’s previous brushes with UEFA. A fringe of mist hung over the stadium as the temperature dipped towards zero. It was cold enough to make one think fondly about a January fixture in Dingwall.

Deila’s selection contained some of the anticipated alterations – with Scepovic and Wakaso Mubarak introduced – but the back four from Saturday’s 1-0 win over Motherwell was retained in the hope of providing a stable base. It didn’t quite work out. Dinamo had threatened early on when Pivaric cut the ball back for skipper Domagoj Antolic, whose low shot was thwarted by an Efe Ambrose block. El Arbi Hilal Soudani was then offside as he found the net, but a home breakthrough duly arrived after 14 minutes. The Croats pressed around the penalty area, with Arijan Ademi eventually miscuing a shot that fell perfectly for Pjaca. He cut on to his right foot, leaving Matthews spinning in his wake, before placing a calm finish beyond Gordon and inside the far post. Celtic could point to a degree of misfortune but Matthews was skinned all too easily. Dinamo’s defence had been disrupted after 11 minutes when Jeremy Tavarel sustained a head knock and had to be replaced by Jozo Simumovic. And their revised line-up was undone in a rather strange fashion as Deila’s men dragged themselves level in the 24th minute. The ball spun high into the air after Virgil van Dijk – captain for the evening after Scott Brown was left home to avoid a suspension risk – smacked a free-kick into the defensive wall. Zagreb goalkeeper Eduardo was motionless as Commons reacted quickest to divert into the net via what looked like a mix of head and shoulder. As a concession, it was sponge-soft. Celtic were emboldened by the equaliser and promptly pushed themselves in front six minutes later. Again, a direct free-kick was key as Commons curled a terrific effort against the bar after being toppled just outside the area. Nir Biton headed back towards goal and Scepovic turned it beyond Eduardo. The Serbian striker lifted up his shirt to reveal a ‘Happy Birthday my love’ message as he raced off towards the Celtic fans in celebration, earning a booking from Lithuania referee Gediminas Mazeika. The lead didn’t last long. The final act of a first half with all the defensive merits of tissue-paper armour arrived six minutes from the interval. An Ambrose challenge inside the area sent the ball to Matthews, only for the Welshman to trip over and continue his angst-ridden evening. Pjaca accepted the gift with gratitude, beating Gordon with the aid of a deflection off Bitton. Whatever was said in the dressing room didn’t cure Celtic’s ills. In fact, they merely fragmented further. Gordon had to save from Soudani and Pjaca in quick succession after the restart, yet had no hope of preventing Zagreb from going back in front after 48 minutes. Antolic outpaced Matthews on Celtic’s right flank and pulled the ball back for Brozovic on the 18-yard line.

Pjaca got in front of Van Dijk to advance menacingly before crashing a 20-yard strike into the net and completing his treble. It was bleak viewing from a Parkhead perspective. Matthews was put out of his misery as Darnell Fisher became the first substitute introduced by Deila. Liam Henderson soon followed in place of the ineffective Callum McGregor. Celtic didn’t really stir again until Pivaric reached an Emilio Izaguirre cross just ahead of Scepovic but succeeded only in finding his own net with nine minutes left. Henderson then saw a dipping effort tipped over by Eduardo before Scepovic was painfully close with a glancing header. The damage had, though, already been done at the other end.","Celtic had already qualified for the knockout stages as group runners-up behind Red Bull Salzburg .

"They are the epitome of survival against the odds, enduring some of the most hostile weather conditions on the planet on a continent that is almost completely barren. Now scientists have gained a valuable insight into how penguins are able to cope with the extreme cold, high winds and months of darkness they experience in Antarctica. Genetic analysis of the genomes of two species of penguin - emperor penguins, the largest of the family, and their smaller cousins Adélie penguins - has revealed some of their secrets to survival. Adélie penguins have eight genes for metabolising fat, which may allow them to adapt quickly to warmer conditions but could leave them struggling in colder weather when food sources are more scarce . Researchers found that the penguins have a vast number of genes responsible for creating the raw material needed for feathers - proteins known as beta-keratins. They carry more genes for a particular type of beta keratin than any other bird and it is thought this is what allows them develop their thick plumage of short, stiff feathers that keep them warm. In a story of enduring love and epic journeys, scientists have identified one of the most faithful couples in the animal kingdom - a pair of Magellanic penguins. While most of these penguins usually have short romances as their pairings are cut short by the death of one of the penguins during their long sea journeys or a failure to successfully produce chicks, biologists from the National Research Council of Argentina discovered one pair whose relationship has spanned more than 16 years. Despite spending long periods apart, each taking solo trips totalling 200,000 miles, the pair have remained a couple for most of their breeding life, returning each year to the same nest and each other to produce a new brood of chicks. Dr PabloGarcia Borboroglu, a researcher at the National Research Council of Argentina and president of the Global Penguin Society, has followed the couple through their relationship. His work has shown that tragically, most Magellanic penguins are precariously balanced. If a couple ever fails to successfully hatch their chicks then they will “divorce”, leaving each other to find new partners. The longest relationships between penguins previously seen by researchers have been between five and ten years before tragedy strikes and they fail to breed successfully. Yet the long lasting relationship of one couple on the Patagonian coastline of southern Argentina has shown that it is possible to beat the odds. The densely packed and barbed feathers also trap air to keep them buoyant and remain waterproof while they are swimming, allowing them to reach speeds of up to 22 mph in some species. The scientists also discovered that penguins have a gene called DSG1, which in humans is known to be involved in a dermatological disease characterised by thick skin on the palms and feet. It believe these genes may help the penguins develop a uniquely thick skin compared to other birds. The DNA analysis also revealed that these two species of penguin have very different mechanisms for storing fat, which helps insulate them from the cold and survive long periods without eating. Male emperor penguins can survive for up to four months without food while incubating their eggs from the Antarctic storms as the females forage out at sea for fish. The researchers found three key genes that they believe may help them to store fat. However, Adélie penguins have eight genes involved in metabolising fat, which may explain why they have been able to adapt more quickly to changes in climate. Professor Guojie Zhang, associate director of the China National Genebank in Shenzhen, who oversaw the study, said: 'Penguins show distinct evolution relative to other bird species. 'They can't fly, have specialized skin and feathers, degenerated wings, and live in a cold environment in which most other birds could not survive. 'Comparative genomics is a powerful tool for providing answers on the molecular basis of these evolutionary changes and how organisms deal with the conditions they are exposed to. 'Our study has revealed several of these secrets for the two penguins. 'The expansion of keratinocyte β-keratin genes and the positive selection on EVPL and DSG1 may have contributed to generating the unique skin and feathers in penguins.' Researchers took blood samples from Adélie penguins (pictured) on Inexpressible Island  in Antarctica . Emperor penguins endure some of the coldest conditions on Earth as they incubate their eggs through the Antarctic winter, but they have unique genes for storing fat and growing dense plumage to keep warm . The researchers, whose work is published in the journal GigaScience, analysed the DNA of a male emperor penguin found on Emperor Island, near Zhongshan Station in east Antarctica and a male Adélie from Inexpressible Island in the Ross Sea of Antarctica. They were conducting their study as part of the Avian Phylogenomics Project, which is aimed at unraveling the avian tree of life. The genetic research showed that penguins first appeared on Earth around 60 million years ago. Emperor and Adélie penguins evolved from a common ancestor around 23 million years ago. The study also showed that the Adélie penguin population increased rapidly about 150,000 years ago when the climate became warmer, but later declined by 40% about 60,000 years ago, when the weather became colder and drier. In contrast, the emperor penguin population remained stable, suggesting that they were better adapted to glacial conditions. The study has also helped to shed light on the evolution of penguins' short wings which they use to 'fly' through the water rather than the air like their avian cousins. The scientists found 17 genes in the penguin genomes taht had unique changes, with one in particular, called EVC, showing a large number of genetic changes compared to other birds. Mutations in EVC2 in humans are known to cause Ellis-van Creveld syndrom, which causes sufferers to have short-limb dwarfism and short ribs. It is possible that changes in this gene is what caused the stubby wings in penguins. Emperor penguins can go without food for upto four months while waiting for their chicks to hatch, which requires them to have specially adapted metabolisms for storing and using fat through in the cold winter . Adélie  and emperor penguins have adapted to the low light conditions they endure during the Antarctic winter . Penguins aquatic lifestyle and the long periods of darkness during the Antarctic winter have also taken their toll on the penguins eyesight. The scientists compared the penguin genome to 48 other bird species. They found that while most birds had four classes of genes for photosensitive proteins in their cone cells of their eyes, Adélie and emperor penguins had just three. It is possible the penguins lost the need for these proteins in their eyes due to the poor light quality they experience. However, emperor penguins, which breed in the winter, had extra genes that are thought to improve the activity of their rod cells - the retinal cells that detect low levels of light - while Adélie, which breed in the spring and summer, did not have these. Professor Zhang added: 'Morphological changes in the epidermis and forelimbs are critical for underwater flight in penguins, so the candidate genes that we discovered in this study are highly valuable for future functional studies. 'The genes involved in light transduction and lipid metabolism exhibit signals of positive selection or pseudogenization in penguins, suggesting their evolutionary responses to the extreme conditions of light and temperature in Antarctica.' The genetic studies will help scientists understand how penguins will adapt to future changes in the climate . However, the findings could also help scientists predict how the penguins will be able to adapt to changing climate conditions in the future. Dr Cai Li, team lead at the Beijing Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, China, said: 'These different patterns in historical population change also suggest that future climate change may have impacts on the two penguin species. 'For example, the fact that emperor penguins didn't experience the same population boom as Adélie penguins in warm climates means that they could suffer more from global warming, and this needs to be considered in conservation efforts in Antarctica.' Professor David Lambert, an evolutionary biologist who also took part in the study at Griffith University, Australia, added: 'Although Adélie and Emperor penguins both breed on the Antarctic continent, they do so in very different ways. 'By sequencing the genomes of two penguin species we have been able to compare many of the genes that are responsible for these different abilities to do the same thing - namely to survive and breed in Antarctica. 'This study is particularly important because it now provides us with the opportunity to conduct large scale evolutionary studies of both species.'","Penguins have 13 genes for protein that helps form their dense plumage .

"More than half of children and young people in England accept cyber-bullying as a part of everyday life, a new survey has found. But parents and teachers say they do not feel they are equipped to deal with the growing problem of internet abuse. Campaigners warned that cyber bullying had become 'an everyday problem for today's children' and demanded better education to tackle the phenomenon. Almost a third of young people said that teaching schools, parents and children about internet safety would be the biggest step in tackling cyber-bullying . More than half of children polled - 55 per cent - said cyber-bullying had become a part of life for children and young people, while 60.5 per cent of parents also said it had. Keeping their children safe online is a major worry for parents, with 49 per cent complaining that the amount of access their child has to the internet leaves them struggling to monitor their behaviour online. And 51 per cent say this makes them scared for the safety of their child. However, the poll suggests that many families would struggle to respond if their child did fall victim to internet abuse. Just a fifth of children felt they were taught enough about it at school . Some 40 per cent of parents said they would not know how to respond if their child fell victim to cyber-bullies or how to set up filters on computers, tablets and mobile phones that could protect their children. There were growing calls for online safety to be taught in more schools, with 69 per cent of teachers and 40 per cent of young people calling for it to be included in the national curriculum. Nearly half of teachers - 43 per cent - admitted their school did not currently teach anything about cyber-bullying and online safety and 44 per cent admitted they did not know how to respond to cyber-bullying. Almost a third - 32.1 per cent - of young people said that teaching schools, parents and children about internet safety would be the biggest step that can be taken to tackle cyber-bullying, yet just a fifth of children felt they were taught enough about it at school. The major new survey, commissioned by the . Anti-Bullying Alliance, underlines the struggle many families face . trying to protect their children on the internet. Luke Roberts, National Co-ordinator of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said cyber-bullying is one of the biggest issues facing young people today and called for the Government to ensure it is taught in all schools. He said: 'Our research shows that cyber-bullying is an everyday problem for today's children, but teachers and parents are not always able to provide the advice and support young people need. 'The solution is better education, not only in the classroom but better training for teachers and support for parents. We need a collaborative approach to tackling cyber-bullying, so children themselves can take responsibility for their own safety online and know where to turn for help when things go wrong. 'If we get this right, and make cyber-bullying a thing of the past, our children will be able to enjoy a digital future that is safe, fun and connected.' He warned online bullying posed such a big threat to young people because it can spread quickly and easily and leave a permanent imprint in cyber space. He said: 'Cyber-bullying can move from online to off line and back online, that is why this conversation is so important. 'Verbal abuse may be the thing most young people encounter in terms of bullying, but cyber-bullying can be an extension of that abuse. 'The particular problem with cyber-bullying is that what would have been private conversation becomes a public display. This means the victim, as well as dealing with that initial harm that is caused by the hurtful language, also has to cope with the fact that everyone in their online communities known about that bullying, and that is really hard to deal with. 'Each time a new app or new social network site comes out it creates its own types of risks. My biggest concern is the anonymity attached to some of these sites, because it is far easier to bully people if you are anonymous.' He warned that cyber-bullying cannot be stopped by simply turning mobile phones and computers off, and called on the Government, parents and teachers to teach young people how to stay safe online. He added: 'It is not up to one area to take this on, it is up to the Government, parents and social networking sites. Everyone needs to come together.'","More than half of children polled said cyber-bullying had become a part of life .

"As a physics graduate from Bristol University, Dave Attwood is partial to a scientific experiment. The England and Bath lock’s latest trial is to see whether blood-sucking leeches can cure his cauliflower ears. After beginning to suffer hearing difficulties because of the condition — caused by excessive pressure on the ear in the scrum and the tackle — the 27-year-old decided to try a different approach to fix the problem. ‘A couple of the England and Bath physios jokingly mentioned it half-heartedly,’ Attwood told Sportsmail.

"Dixie Dean, Duncan Ferguson, Bob Latchford, Graeme Sharp, Joe Royle - all previous Everton No 9s, owners of the most iconic shirt in the Blues’ history. Ever since the days of Dean, the famous jersey has always belonged to Everton’s main man in the box, the predator in front of goal and, certainly in Big Dunc’s case, the marksman who could ruffle a few of the opponents’ feathers. The shirt has always held a special meaning at Goodison Park. However the current incumbent of Everton’s most sought-after shirt is yet to make anywhere near the same impact as his much-loved predecessors. Everton striker Arouna Kone made an eagerly-awaited return from injury in the Europa League . Kone bursts through the Russian side's defence before releasing a shot without success . The Ivorian forward produced a bright performance that was only missing a comeback goal . Arouna Kone - through no fault of his own it must be said - has had a nightmare 18 months at Everton following his £6million arrival from Wigan in the summer of 2013. The Ivorian arrived on Merseyside with former Latics boss Roberto Martinez as the man to spearhead the Spaniard’s blue revolution. However, after a less than convincing start to life at Everton – which included fluffing relatively easy chances at home to Hull and against Stevenage in the League Cup - the striker was injured, ending his debut season prematurely. Now, having returned to fitness, Kone was desperate to open his Everton account having watched his team-mates struggle for form this term after last season’s impressive fifth-placed finish. Kone battles for the ball with FC Krasnodar's Andreas Granqvist as he presses for a goal . Arouna Kone was active across the pitch and found some dangerous positions on the left - CLICK HERE for more stats from our Match Zone . The 31-year-old argues with referee Istvan Kovacs after receiving a caution . ‘If I did manage to score it would be fantastic,’ said Kone on Wednesday. ‘It would represent the beginning of a big comeback. I’ve got such a huge passion to get my first goal for Everton. It would be marvellous.’ Taking to the field as the lone frontman, Kone, distinctive with his bright white hair, strutted around the pitch before kick-off like Everton No 9s of old. Clearly confident and raring to go, the former PSV forward made an encouraging start. On ten minutes the Ivorian barged his opponent off the ball and cut inside with pace before running into a cul-de-sac. Dispossessed but showing the intent up front the Goodison faithful expect from their strikers. Duncan Ferguson (left) and Dixie Dean set the benchmark for Everton's most loved strikers . Ricardo Laborde celebrates after scoring what would be the winning goal for FK Krasnodar . Kone and Kieran Dowell (right) look dejected after Everton go behind in what was essentially a dead rubber . Five minutes later and his dream comeback looked on. Finding space from 20 yards out, the play opened up for Kone who, sensing an opportunity to score his first goal in the blue of Everton, took aim and unleashed a powerful effort as Krasnodar keeper Andrei Sinitsin made a smart save to his right. Buoyed by the crowds reactions to his efforts, Kone then attempted an overhead kick – it may have gone away from goal but supporters appreciated his audaciousness. The striker seemed to be revelling at being back on the pitch in a competitive game. The second half saw a much quieter Kone but showing a glimpse of skill to work his way into the box after jinking past a helpless defender certainly got the crowd on their feet. Having doubted his capabilities following his first few months at the club, Kone may have changed fan opinion based on Thursday’s showing. Arouna Kone made 25 passes and two shots on target - CLICK HERE for more stats from our brilliant Match Zone . Kone joined Everton manager Roberto Martinez to answer questions ahead of the game . The striker cut short his summer holidays and stayed at Finch Farm in a bid to improve his fitness and seems determined to make his mark at Goodison Park and did his case no harm in this dead-rubber despite failing to find a goal. After an encouraging performance, should Kone can stay fit, Everton, who also boast Samuel Eto’o and Romelu Lukaku among their striking ranks, may just have a trio of attackers as good as any other in this season’s Europa League. There is still much, much more to do to become the next great Everton No 9 but the desire and intent is there from Kone.","Everton lost 1-0 to FK Krasnodar in their final Europa League group game .

"So it wasn't quite the 'celebration of football' Roberto Martinez hoped it would be but, on this occasion, he didn't grumble. Having made light work of progressing through Group H, dismantling Wolfsburg and Lille en route to the last 32 of the Europa League, Everton's manager took the chance to experiment and give opportunities to the 'diamonds of our Academy' in an environment free from pressure. But, as it turned out, this transpired to be a game that will not live long in the memory, not even for those who were given their first starts against Krasnodar. On a rain-sodden Merseyside night, Everton ended the Europa League group stage with a lacklustre defeat. VIDEO Scroll down for Roberto Martinez: Very pleased with reaction of the young players .

Att: 20,260 . Ratings by DOMINIC KING at Goodison Park . A goal from Ricardo Laborde in the first half, when he capitalised on dreadful goalkeeping from Joel Robles, gave Krasnodar victory yet Martinez will not be unduly concerned. Never one to dwell on a negative, he saw this as a worthwhile experiment after they overcame initial stage fright. 'I thought the first half was really cagey, the second half was completely different,' said Martinez. 'They got a unique experience and after this, we have different footballers. It was very pleasing to see the way they progressed. It was just a shame we couldn't get a positive result.' Much of the interest beforehand centred on Arouna Kone, who had celebrated two birthdays since he last kicked a ball in public for Everton's first team. This, the Ivorian hoped, would be the beginning of what he called a 'big comeback'. Yet a closer examination of the teamsheet showed there were other stories, not least the promotion of 17-year-old Ryan Ledson, a young midfielder for whom Martinez has high hopes. So do England, as illustrated by Under 21 head coach Gareth Southgate's attendance. Ledson, who has been at Everton's Academy since he was five, has enjoyed a memorable 12 months. He signed his first professional contract in August, having lead England's Under-17s to success in Malta in the European Championships. Given a key role in midfield, Ledson worked hard and showed an impressive understanding of the game. He used the ball smartly and never being afraid to bark out orders to those with more experience – Gareth Barry, playing as a central defender, would testify to that. Showing what Martinez described as 'football arrogance', Ledson was the pick of a bunch that included Conor McAleny, Kieran Dowell – who replaced the hamstrung Christian Atsu – and Chris Long. This is unlikely to be the last time you hear about him. 'You need days like to day – it is one in a lifetime,' said Martinez. 'It was just a real shame that some of them were shocked in the first half but you saw what they could do in the second half.'

GROUP H FINAL STANDINGS . Ricardo Laborde pounced on poor goalkeeper from Joel Robles to score for Krasnodar - CLICK HERE FOR MATCH ZONE . Everton, to their credit, slashed the price of tickets in an attempt to a get a healthy pre-Christmas crowd – the most expensive was £15 – but the crackle you associate with this stadium on a European night was absent. This, effectively, was an exhibition match. Still, it was one Everton wanted to win. Their progress in Europe so far has been serene and they had the first opportunity in the 14th minute, when Kone latched on to a pass from McAleny and drilled a 25-yard shot that Krasnodar keeper Andrei Sinitsin beat away. Krasnodar, though, had not travelled just to fulfil their obligations and in the 16th minute Wanderson, the Brazilian striker, burst clear and smashed a shot straight at Robles that left the keeper with a bloodied nose. The blow seemed to cloud his senses as, he was found wanting when Krasnodar broke away,  Laborde, their Colombian midfielder, latched on to a ball from Marat Izmailov to open the scoring.

Laborde squeezed his shot inside the near post to leave Goodison silent, save for the 14 cheering fans who had made a 2,000-mile trek here from Russia. A similar pattern followed after the break. Everton played at a higher tempo but never looked like equalising. If anything, Krasnodar should have doubled their lead but Izamailov fluffed his lines after Robles was caught in no man's land. By then, they had done enough. Still Martinez was content. 'It's part of what we want to achieve to develop our youngsters,' he said. 'If we don't give them opportunities they will never learn.'","Laborde scored the winning goal for Russian side in the 30th minute .

"The two siblings of a wealthy Manhattan real estate mogul are currently at war with each other in court as they attempt to track down a secret stash of buried gold and silver their brother only told them about right before he died. Robert Giaimo and Janet Vitale have been on a high-profile treasure for the gold coins and silver bars worth an estimated $4.5 million since 2007 and are still yet to find the collection. Their brother, Edward Giaimo Jr, who owned 18 properties on the Upper East Side, died at the age of 67 without her disclosing the location, DNA Info are reporting. Court papers say the 200,000 Troy ounces of silver and 1,000 Krugerrands are either buried at the family's property in Pelham Manor, New York, or in an unknown storage facility. 'X' marks the spot?: Siblings Robert Giaimo and Janet Vitale have been searching for eight years for $4.5 million worth of gold and silver that had been hidden by their late brother, which could be buried on the family's Pelham Manor property (pictured) Robert and Janet were locked in a court battle over documents that could hold the vital clues as to where the treasure is buried. The battle is just part of a fight over how to split their brother's fortune, which tallies at $48 million. Robert Giaimo sued his sister in 2008 for not letting him into the Pelham Manor house where Edward and their mother lived. At the time Janet had just discovered $7 million cash hidden behind a closet in the attic. She also found $3 million in a safe in the basement. The money had come from their late brother skimming rent money that had been paid to the family business from the tenants in their many buildings, according to DNA Info. Hidden treasure: The 200,000 Troy ounces of silver and 1,000 Krugerrands - South African coins - are now thought to be worth about $4.5 million . Janet had taken over the family business before Edward's death. The siblings are still fighting over what will happen to the $10 million that was found. Following Edward's death in 2007, Janet claimed Robert had tried to conceal the location of the treasure from her. 'Edward mentioned that there was some gold and silver bars or whatever you want to call them,' Janet said. 'And I was cut off immediately by Robert and he said, 'You don't want to know about that.

"West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has slapped a £20million price tag on Winston Reid — even though the defender could be available for free next summer. Reid has been a regular in the Hammers team that has had a superb start to the season, climbing to fourth in the table. But the centre back is yet to sign a new deal and, with his contract expiring at the end of the season, has been linked with a January move to Arsenal or Liverpool. West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has slapped a £20million price tag on New Zealand defender Winston Reid . Reid has played a key role in helping the Hammers to fourth in the Premier League table . However, Allardyce has revealed he has no plans to sell Reid during the upcoming transfer window — unless another club decides to splash the cash. ‘He ain’t going anywhere. He is not going anywhere unless someone bids £20m or something like that,’ said Allardyce. ‘There is obviously not a lot I can do about that. ‘If somebody flirts around with a measly offer because he is in the last year of his contract, we would make more money by keeping him and finishing where we are in the league — rather than selling him and putting our good season in jeopardy. ‘Because replacing him in January — replacing anybody in January — is a very difficult job indeed.’ Hammers manager Allardyce said it would not be worth selling Reid for a small sum in January . Reid's contract expires in the summer, meaning he would be available to leave on a free transfer . Talks over a new deal between Hammers owners and Reid have been rumbling on since the summer. But despite the wait Allardyce is still hopeful the 26-year-old will commit himself to the club and sign a new deal at Upton Park. ‘I just don’t pay too much attention to it now it has gone on so long,’ added Allardyce. ‘I just hope that the phone call is a yes when the chairman rings me up at some stage. ‘At the moment it is neither a positive nor a negative.

"What do you get when you have arguably the world's greatest-ever player, playing the current No 1 football game on the planet? Well in truth, not the spectacle that one would hope for. Three-time World Cup winner Pele took on his former Santos and Brazil team-mate Coutinho at a game of FIFA 15 on an Xbox recently - in an affair that would likely feature last on Match of the Day if it was played out in reality. VIDEO Scroll down to see Pele face Coutinho at FIFA 15 on an Xbox . Santos legend Pele (left) took on his former strike-partner Coutinho at FIFA 15 recently . The pair took each other on with identical Santos teams from their heyday in the 1950s and 60s . The 70-somethings were visibly unfamiliar with the game or the console that they were playing on . Having forged a deadly partnership for Santos over a half century ago in December 1958 as teenagers, the pair failed to set their virtual game alight - with only one goal separating the two greats. The match wasn't a tight affair though for it's skill, but more due to a lack of it as the two 70-somethings were unfamiliar with the game, or the console that they played it on, unsurprisingly. Rather comically the pair seem confused as to what the controls were - but take it in all good heart as they laugh at their own misgivings. And once more - like throughout his glittering career - Pele proved the matchwinner scoring the only goal to separate the two sides; as Santos faced Santos in a special clash that featured the duo featuring virtually with their team-mates from their formidable team in the 1950s and 60s. Despite their struggles to get to grips with the game the pair were all smiles as they played FIFA 15 . Pele (left) showed he's gracious in defeat by shaking the hand of Coutinho after the full-time whistle . Ironically though, it was the real-life Pele who tasted some of his own goalscoring medicine for once, with Coutinho controlling his virtual version to score and win the game 1-0. Seeing the iconic Brazil No 10 in a jovial manner though will please everyone in the football world after the 74-year-old recently was recently discharged from hospital on Tuesday. Pele spent 16 days at the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo after being diagnosed with an urinary tract infection that stemmed from an operation to remove kidney stones but, having left semi-intensive care last weekend, he is now feeling 'recovered'.

"Law enforcement in Los Angeles have been left stunned after they discovered photographs on social media showing young children holding AK-47's during a massive crackdown on the notorious Rollin' 30s Harlem Crips gang. In one of the shocking images a young girl in Disney pajamas brandishes the iconic Russian assault rifle, pointing the barrel right at the camera - while in another, a little boy holds a hand gun towards the lens. Recovered during a massive raid on Thursday across South LA, almost 1,000 members of the LAPD and the FBI took about three dozen members of the dangerous gang into custody as they attempt to stem crime across the city. Scroll Down for Video . Disturbing: This image shows a young girl wearing Disney pajamas pointing an AK-47 rifle at the camera. The image was recovered during a massive crackdown on the Rollin' 30s Harlem Crips gang in LA . Violence: In another shocking image a young boy points a handgun at the camera . 'It's a culture of violence,' said LAPD Commander, Bill Scott. 'When you grow up in a culture like that, violence becomes secondary. It becomes second nature. And that's the cycle we're trying to disrupt.' The 30 or so gang members arrested on drug and conspiracy charges are the culmination of Operation Thumbs Down, which has been in the pipeline for 18 months and targeted the Rollin' 30s Harlem Crips leaders. The investigation's name directly refers to the Rollin' 30s hand gesture - two thumbs pointed up, representing the 'H' in Harlem. Notorious across the south of LA, the gang has around 1,000 members and is thought to be responsible for up to 29 murders over the course of the last five years according to the LAPD. Terrifying: The shocking photos were discovered during a raid by the LAPD and FBI on the notorious Harlem Crips gang . 'It's a culture of violence': LAPD Commander Bill Scott said growing up in the confines of the gang creates cycle of violence that must be disrupted . Crackdown: FBI Agent Timothy Delaney explained to the media the importance of the raid while (right) LAPD Commander Bill Scott commended his officers . Raid: Almost 1,000 police were involved in the crackdown by LAPD which involved the FBI who issued warrants for the chiefs of the notorious gang . In addition, the gang is thought to have perpetrated around 1,100 robberies and over a thousand assaults in the 1.5 square-mile area that makes up the gang's area according to the LA Times. 'Among the Bloods and the Crips gangs, the Rollin' 30s are among the more sophisticated,' said Assistant U.S. Attorney, Christopher Pelham. According to federal investigators, the Rollin' 30s has three distinct branches - 'The Avenues', 'Denker Park' and '39th Street'. However, law enforcement authorities have said that they believe the gangs activity is spreading beyond South LA. Weapons: A large amount of illegal firearms were also recovered during the raid - which took place on Thursday across South LA . Haul: Narcotics were also brought in by law enforcement as they cracked down on the Crips gang across the city . 'We’ve traced them up into Simi Valley, up into Van Nuys, different parts of the city,' said FBI Special Agent in Charge Timothy Delaney. 'So they’re not only preying on their local community, they’re starting to spread out and preying on different areas of Los Angeles.' And in addition to the federal and drug and gang conspiracy charges, the task force served 34 search warrants, seizing guns and drugs. When asked about how much money this gang generated, federal authorities were not able to give an exact answer, but they believe this operation might be generating $1 million to $2 million a year. City Attorney Mike Feuer said that his office will continue to take civil actions against gang-controlled locations in Los Angeles. 'These actions say to the owner of a property, 'We need you to take steps to get gang members out of your properties, we need you to take steps to ensure your properties are safe.' If convicted, the 35 defendants will face mandatory to prison terms of 5-10 years and maximum penalties of 20 to 30 years in federal prisons. The defendants were scheduled to make appearances in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday and Friday. Among those arrested and federally charged were 34-year-old, Jovan Harris, aka 'Headache' and Moses Williams, 34, aka 'Termite'. This case is the result of an investigation by members of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Task Force on Violent Gangs, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Los Angeles Police Department; the United States Attorney’s Office; and the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office.","Images recovered during huge LAPD and FBI raid across South LA on the notorious Rollin' 30s Harlem Crips gang .

"Hereford United's suspension 'from all football activity' has been lifted by The FA just 24 hours after it was imposed. English football's governing body handed out the punishment on Wednesday after Hereford and club official Alan McCarthy failed to comply with regulations under the owners' and directors' test. McCarthy had been charged with acting as an officer of Hereford without written confirmation from the FA to do so. Yet the issue appears to have been a largely clerical one, with the governing body requesting additional documentation which has since been provided. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hereford's famous FA Cup giantkilling of Newcastle . Hereford's class of '72, including Ronnie Radford (top left), celebrate victory against Newcastle . Newcastle keeper Wille McFaul is left grasping at thin air as Radford's shot whizzes past him . Hereford United, also known as the Bulls, have been hit by another punishment from the FA . An FA statement read: 'The suspension of and Alan McCarthy from all football and football activity has been lifted with immediate effect following their compliance with the orders of the Independent Regulatory Commission.' The club, famous for producing one of the FA Cup's best-loved giantkillings, were expelled from the Football Conference in June after missing a deadline to pay football creditors, and have been playing in the Southern Premier League. 'Having failed to comply with the orders of the Independent Regulatory Commission, both Hereford United and Alan McCarthy are suspended from all football and football activity with immediate effect,' Wednesday's FA statement read. 'The club and Mr McCarthy, Officer of Hereford United FC, were ordered to fully and correctly comply with their obligations under the Owners' and Directors' Test Regulations by 4pm on Thursday 4 December 2014. 'Following consideration of a document submitted by the club, the Independent Regulatory Commission gave the parties until 4pm on Monday 8 December 2014 to submit further documentation to satisfy the orders of the Commission. 'Having failed to provide the requested further documentation by the deadline, both Hereford United and Mr McCarthy shall remain suspended until such time as the order of the Independent Regulatory Commission has been complied with to the satisfaction of the Commission. 'The FA understands the importance of football clubs to their local communities and will continue to work with all relevant parties to ensure senior football returns to Hereford at the earliest opportunity, although this will be contingent on the club complying with the Regulations and subsequent orders of the Independent Regulatory Commission.' Cash-strapped Hereford were expelled from the Football Conference in June for failing to pay creditors . The club have been based at their Edgar Street home since 1924 but now face an uncertain future . Despite mostly languishing among the lower reaches of the Football League, Hereford will be remembered for one of the FA Cup's most famous giantkillings. Few gave the then non-League team a prayer in their FA Cup third round replay against Newcastle United in February 1972. Things looked even bleaker when Malcolm Macdonald put Newcastle ahead with just eight minutes left of the match, which was played on a quagmire of a pitch. But Ronnie Radford scored with a bullet shot from 30 yards with five minutes remaining to spark a pitch invasion, then a 2-1 extra-time win and also a generation's love affair with football. Legendary BBC commentator John Motson, during his first full season working for Match Of The Day, helped the game into football folklore as he said: 'No goalkeeper in the world would have stopped that.'

"It's bound to happen isn't it? Tottenham's defeat against Besiktas here in the Ataturk Olympic Stadium saw Mauricio Pochettino's side relinquish top spot in Europa League Group C, meaning the Londoners could now face a much trickier last 32 clash.

Referee: Stefan Johannesson . Spurs find out on Monday who'll they'll face in the next round, but the prospect of their former manager returning to White Hart Lane will get the juices flowing until then. It would be the Portuguese's first return to the club since his unceremonious sacking last December. He'll undoubtedly have something to prove. Though, the return of Villas-Boas would have been the final thing on Pochettino's mind as he watched his side throw away top spot - and the prospect of an easier draw. Besiktas were forced to put on two sound and light parties to keep supporters entertained during two floodlight failures. Pochettino won't be in a party mood as he makes his way back to London, though. The big team news was the return of Kyle Walker following a nine month lay-off due to a troublesome abdominal injury. Spurs just needed a point to prevent Besiktas from leapfrogging them into top spot. Pochettino was adamant ahead of kick-off that finishing top of their pool remained a priority for him and his side. He still, though, played a raft of his fringe stars in an attempt to keep his squad fresh ahead of the hectic festive period. And the visitors made a bright start, Roberto Soldado just failing to get a head on Nacer Chadli's dangerous cross from the left in the sixth minute before the first blackout two minutes later. The home support did their best to brighten up proceedings as thousands of camera phones lit up the pitch black stadium. And to their credit, the blackout didn't dampen the noise coming from the small but vociferous home support. Likewise, club officials were determined not to let the floodlight failure ruin proceedings, blaring some rather questionable Turkish disco music over the PA system . You could forgive the handful of Spurs fans who made the trip to Istanbul for thinking they were in some dodgy nightclub in Taksim Square rather than a football match. Tottenham's Europa League encounter against Besiktas had to be suspended for 13 minutes after the lights went out in the stadium . Supporters of both sides flashed lights on their personal devices after the floodlights went out in the eighth minute . Tottenham playmaker Nacer Chadli evades Kerim Frei Koyunlu during the encounter at Ataturk Stadium . Finally, after a 15 minute delay the players re-emerged from the tunnel as the lights came back on. And the intermission slowed the early momentum Spurs had started to gather as Besiktas shifted up a gear. The hosts were chasing and throwing themselves into tackles like qualification into the next round depended on it. Perhaps it was the sight of manager Slaven Bilic - in a suit and beanie hat - geeing them up at every opportunity in his technical area. However, Soldado missed an excellent chance in the 16th minute to take the lead, failing to capitalise on Paulinho's clever flick deep inside the penalty area. Andros Townsend had the ball in the net in the 26th minute following Mousa Dembele's through ball - but his well-executed chipped finish was ruled out for offside. Olcay Sahan then went close, firing a curling right-foot strike narrowly wide of Michel Vorm's far post four minutes later, before Soldado chose to cross instead of shoot in a good position after Townsend's clever reverse pass. Despite both sides having already qualified for the next round, there was no hint of anyone taking their foot off the gas - particularly not the hosts. There was, though, a distinct lack of goalmouth action as the first half ended goalless. Even referee Stefan Johannesson seemed bored - blowing the half-time whistle four seconds before the 45th minute. Pochettino would have been content, if not happy, with his side's opening 45 minutes. They were comfortable if not dominant against a side who were clearly pumped up for the occasion. Serdar Kurtulus sent a long-range effort narrowly over the bar as the second half got underway, before Danny Rose saw his cross-cum-shot palmed away by Tolga Zengin in the 55th minute. Tottenham stars Roberto Soldado, Paulinho and Mousa Dembele look dejected after conceding a goal against Besiktas . Tottenham right back Kyle Walker made his first appearance for nine months after recovering from an abdominal injury . Besiktas forward Cenk Tosun then went agonisingly close to opening the scoring in the 58th minute, smashing a 25-yard half-volley on to the crossbar after skipper Younes Kaboul had sloppily lost possession. But the hosts didn't have to wait much longer to take a deserved lead thanks to Tosun, who finished from close range after excellent combination play between Gokhan Tore and Sahan. And the Turks should have doubled their lead in the 68th minute but Ersan Gulum wasted a brilliant opportunity after a defence-splitting one-two with Jose Sosa. Spurs were on the ropes as Pochettino watched his side lose their grip on top spot in the group, and he introduced Erik Lamela and Aaron Lennon in search of an equaliser that would keep them in pole position. But it was Besiktas who continued to look most likely, Sosa wasting another chance from deep inside the area in the 75th minute. Spurs were toiling, and looked void of attacking ideas as the second of the evening's blackouts occurred in injury time. By that time Tottenham's hopes of finishing top were already extinguished.

"There must have been times during the past nine months when Kyle Walker felt the lights had gone out on his career. At the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul, the lights did quite literally go out - but Walker was certainly back with a vengeance. The right back suffered an abdominal injury way back in March. It curtailed his season with Tottenham and, worse still, precluded him from the World Cup with England, a tournament he almost certainly would have been picked for. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Besiktas 1-0 Tottenham Hotspur . Kyle Walker made his long-awaited return to the Tottenham first team against Besiktas on Thursday night . Besiktas winger Kerim Koyunlu tumbles to the ground while the England full back protects the ball . ‘It was definitely my lowest point,’ Walker admitted this week as he recalled how he watched Roy Hodgson’s team flop out in Brazil from home, never knowing whether he could have improved things. It didn’t help one bit that Walker had missed Euro 2012 with a broken toe. Was he cursed? It must have crossed his mind. ‘It has been a difficult long term injury to cope with, both mentally and physically. I had to dig deep,’ he added. But here, on a miserable wet evening in Istanbul, in front of a half-empty arena which was plunged into darkness for a quarter-hour in the first-half, a fully-charged Walker made his return after that horribly long absence. And it didn’t look as though he’d missed a day. In the post-Glen Johnson era, it looks like a fight between Walker and Southampton’s Nathaniel Clyne to be England’s right back. Walker’s bid to impress Hodgson began here. As his body recovered, Walker had ample time to dissect his game. Could tweaks be made? What could be done better? Mauricio Pochettino's side had already qualified from their Europa League Group before the match . The Sheffield-born full back couldn't prevent Spurs slipping to a 1-0 loss to Besiktas on his return . He confessed in the build-up to his return that his positional play - in other words his defensive play - could be improved. That voice in his head that told him to get his head down and bomb forward at every opportunity needed to be hushed a little. ‘I think it will make me a better player,’ Walker said on the eve of this game. So Walker has been deconstructed and reassembled. On this evidence, it’s to very promising effect. In many ways, this was the perfect match to be thrown back into. Since being declared match fit, Walker had only played 66 minutes of an Under 21 match with Manchester City at the Lamex Stadium in Stevenage. So, from Hertfordshire to 'Hell' - or at least a pale imitation of it. With both sides already through, there was nothing riding on this one and it showed, with those assembled filling barely a third of the 76,000-capacity Olympic Stadium. Walker could re-immerse himself with out the pressure of needing to win the match and he was straight into the thick of things. Within seconds of the the start, Walker was making clearing headers and just three minutes in, he was off on his first charge forward, drawing a foul on the half-way line. Walker, who missed the World Cup in Brazil, has been out for nine months with an abdominal injury . Nathaniel Clyne has emerged as England's first choice this season after brilliant displays for Southampton . We were then plunged into darkness on eight minutes, the floodlights completely failing to leave only the sponsor boards and hundreds of mobile phone screens for illumination. The players were off for 16 minutes in all, but it didn’t interrupt Walker’s power surges. There one moment in particular when we knew the old player was back. Andros Townsend had the ball but, confronted by the Besiktas defence, had nowhere really to turn. Then, suddenly, like an express train, Walker had darted forward 30 yards to offer an overlap. The resulting cross didn’t result in anything for Spurs but his willingness to support the attack was promising. He was even more effective after the interval, getting into good positions and skinning his man on three or four occasions before swinging in a cross. Walker was replaced on 76 minutes by Etienne Capoue, not as yet ready to play a full 90. But he’d done more than enough to suggest his best form won’t be too far away.

"Nigel Pearson has been charged with using insulting language by the FA over his foul-mouthed row with a Leicester City fan. The Leicester manager was filmed appearing to tell an abusive supporter to ‘f*** off and die’ after being called an ‘utter t***’ near the end of City’s defeat by Liverpool at the King Power Stadium on December 2. Pearson has until 6pm on Tuesday to respond but has so far been unrepentant. He said last week: ‘I’m more than happy to stand up for myself in that situation. If people were offended then that is regrettable but there is no need to apologise to somebody of that ilk.’ Leicester boss Nigel Pearson has been charged by the FA after an incident with a Foxes supporter . Pearson (centre) will have to await the FA's submission before finding out if he faces a misconduct charge . Pearson stands on the touchline during the defeat by Liverpool before launching his tirade . Leicester manager Pearson appeared to tell the supporter to 'f*** off and die' during the match . The FA statement read: ‘It is alleged that during the fixture Mr Pearson used abusive and/or insulting words towards a spectator.’ If Pearson accepts the charge or is found guilty, he faces a fine and touchline ban — although he already elects to sit in the stands during matches. His expletive-fuelled exchange came when he travelled to the dugout for the closing stages. Pearson made the decision to move to the stands after serving a one-match touchline ban for clashing with officials after a game in August 2013. Alan Pardew was given a three-match stadium ban last March — but that was for the much more serious offence of headbutting David Meyler. In April 2011, Wayne Rooney was suspended for two games for swearing into a television camera, while Luis Suarez was handed a one-match ban in December that year for making an obscene gesture to Fulham fans. An Independent Regulatory Commission will decide any potential sanction if the charge is proven. Yesterday, before the FA made their announcement, Pearson was tight-lipped. ‘I have said as much as I want to say on that subject, regardless of what happens here on in I won’t be saying much more,’ he said. ‘My focus is totally on this next game and we welcome the champions.’ The Leicester boss continues his tirade against the supporter from the touchline . Pearson’s preparations for the visit of Manchester City were dealt a huge blow after Kasper Schmeichel suffered a broken metatarsal during training yesterday morning. The Denmark goalkeeper will undergo an operation today and has been ruled out for at least a month — but Pearson admitted that diagnosis was optimistic and it ‘could be longer’ depending on the surgeon’s findings. ‘There was no contact. Normally what happens with those injuries is a stress situation, foot to the floor,’ said Pearson. ‘Clearly the lad’s distressed about it — he will be a big miss for us but what you have to do is deal with it.’ Ben Hamer will step up for the City game — having kept a clean sheet at Stoke in September — but Pearson admitted he was likely to dip into the transfer market. ‘I would have thought so,’ he said. ‘If he’s going to be four to six weeks at the earliest then I’ll be considering options certainly.’ England Under 21 goalkeeper Jack Butland, back at Stoke following an emergency loan spell at Derby, and Mark Schwarzer, third choice at Chelsea, would both be available.","FA asked Nigel Pearson for his thoughts on his row with a fan .

"Manchester City's Champions League hero Joe Hart has revealed he is on the verge of committing his long-term future to the club by signing a new contract. The goalkeeper, 27, had a fine game in City’s 2-0 win in Rome on Wednesday that saw them through to the next round of the Champions League. And afterwards he revealed that a new contract with the club he joined from Shrewsbury in 2006 is now ready to be signed. ‘As far as I am aware it is pretty much sorted,’ said England’s No 1. ‘I leave it to the legal side to sort but I am very happy at this club and hopefully in the near future I will be signing that contract. How could I not be happy to stay? I love this place and I love everything about Manchester City.

Hart certainly believes the big win in Rome could be a turning point for the club’s fortunes in Europe. ‘It was about time we did something like this,’ said Hart, who produced a string of superb saves to keep the scores level in the group-deciding win at the Stadio Olimpico. ‘We can’t get away from the fact we started the campaign poorly but we have come good at the right time when we needed to and we have won the game. ‘We need to build on this. We got ourselves through last time and struggled against Barcelona so we have to look to go positive and see what we can do.’ City midfielder James Milner is also set to commit his future to Manuel Pellegrini's side .","Hart is close to putting pen to paper on new contract .

"Alan Pardew has told Arsenal fans to lay off Arsene Wenger and believes they should be grateful for all he has done at the club. The Newcastle boss insists that only Sir Alex Ferguson has achieved more in the Premier League era because Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho ‘hasn’t done enough yet’. Pardew goes so far as to say that the Emirates Stadium should be renamed in honour of Wenger. Arsene Wenger has been in charge of Arsenal since 1996, leading the club to multiple trophies and titles . Wenger endured dog's abuse at Stoke station following the Premier League defeat last weekend . The Arsenal boss is under increasing pressure after he was abused by his own supporters at a railway station following last weekend’s 3-2 defeat at Stoke, a result that left Arsenal sixth in the table and 13 points behind leaders Chelsea. But Pardew, who faces Wenger in Saturdays tea-time kick-off, said: ‘The incident at the train station was totally disrespectful. I think 99 per cent of Arsenal fans would have been ashamed of that and we could get the backlash of it. They will want to show how much they love him. ‘That stadium should be named after him. The job he did in that move across (from Highbury), when they had all that debt and he had to be very careful with the transfer budget — it was a miracle that he kept them in the Champions League. ‘I think everyone at Arsenal knows he’s done a magnificent job. For me, he’s the second best manager in Premier League history (behind Sir Alex Ferguson). Jose (Mourinho) hasn’t done enough yet.’ Pardew suggested that the club should rename the Emirates Stadium in honour of their longest-serving boss . Pardew said Wenger is the second best manager in  Premier League history - better than the Special One . The incomparable Sir Alex Ferguson takes the title as the best boss, according to the Newcastle manager . Wenger has found an unlikely ally in Pardew, the man he once shoved in a heated touchline fracas. They clashed at Upton Park in 2006 when Pardew’s West Ham scored a late winner against the Gunners, but the pair are now the longest-serving bosses in the top flight. And Pardew added: ‘I’ve had one run-in with Arsene, but otherwise he’s been fantastic. I have nothing but respect for him and I’ve always enjoyed watching his teams.’ Arsenal and Newcastle are only separated by goal difference and an away victory would intensify the scrutiny on Wenger and his position, despite them making it through to the Champions League knockout stages for the 15th consecutive season after Tuesday’s 4-1 win at Galatasaray. But Pardew, who survived calls for his own sacking earlier in the season, admitted: ‘Arsene knows that instant results are massive, even for someone who has been in the position as long as he has. All of us managers are on a six-game, seven-game period with the media and social media. We have to accept that.’ Wenger and Pardew clashed on the touchlines while the former was boss at the Boleyn Ground in 2006 . The pair shake hands a year later during a frosty moment with Pardew now managing Charlton . Over time, it looks like the duo have grown rather fond of one another as this picture, taken in April, shows . Pardew, though, hopes Wenger was cheered by Newcastle’s 2-1 victory over Mourinho’s Chelsea, meaning Arsenal’s unbeaten ‘Invincibles’ tag from the 2003-2004 campaign remains intact at least for another season. ‘I imagine Arsene might have had a glass of wine after that game,’ said Pardew. ‘When you have that tag you don’t want to lose it to anyone. ‘But we can only worry about us, it was a tremendous performance against Chelsea and the players can be proud. ‘We’re on a good run but this is a difficult one because Arsenal away has not been a happy hunting ground for us. They have given us a thumping and on one occasion it was an embarrassing scoreline (7-3, in 2012). ‘The games at our place have been a lot closer and we hope this one is a lot tighter as well.’","Newcastle boss Pardew says Wenger is the second best manager in Premier League history .

"Flight delays are nearly inevitable when it comes to holiday travel. But it turns out some of the most popular winter sun destinations have particularly dismal on-time performance ratings. New research has found that British passengers experience some of the worst flight delays while travelling between the UK and Orlando in Florida and the Spanish island of Mallorca. Flight routes to British holiday destinations Orlando and Mallorca have particularly poor on-time ratings . Virgin Atlantic's Gatwick to Orlando route has a history of delays and an on-time percentage of just 47% . According to statistics released by worldwide passenger rights specialist refund.me, more than one in two flights on Virgin Atlantic's London Gatwick to Orlando route departed late, with return flights performing on slightly better with 59 per cent of flights departing on time. One flight on the Gatwick-Orlando route was delayed by an astonishing five hours and 13 minutes, while a return flight endured an even longer delay of five hours and 34 minutes. And when it comes to Palma de Mallorca, another top holiday destination, similar travel nightmares are also commonplace. Two flights operated by Thomson from the island to London Luton and London Gatwick airports had on-time ratings of just 46 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively. In one instance, passengers returning to Luton were left waiting for four hours and 50 minutes. Thomson flights from Manchester had a similarly sub-standard on-time record of 56 per cent with Jet2's flights faring only slightly better with 59 per cent of flights arriving on time. Refund.me, which helps airline passengers claim compensation under EU legislation for delays, cancellations, missed connections and overbooking, analysed on-time records for UK airlines between August and October to find out which routes were most affected. All flights that leave from an EU airport, regardless of the airline or destination, are covered by EU regulations which guarantee eligible passengers compensation of up to £475 for disruptions. Two Mallorca-London flights operated by Thomson had on-time ratings as low as 46 per cent . Thomson flights from Manchester to Mallorca had a similarly sub-standard on-time record . Likewise, passengers entering the EU on flights operated by EU carriers are also covered. 'Flight delays when going on holiday can be particularly frustrating, and can really cut into vacation time,' said Eve Buechner, founder and CEO of refund.me. 'Unfortunately it is impossible to replace lost time, but at least we enable passengers to claim compensation from airlines when they are delayed by three hours or more – and for flights up to six years ago.'","Refund.me analysed on-time performance over the past several months .

"Sportsmail's Jonathan McEvoy exclusively revealed the news on Wednesday that Jenson Button is staying at McLaren . Jenson Button relived the moment on Thursday he received the call he feared would never come. It was Monday and McLaren chairman Ron Dennis spoke to offer him a Formula One race seat for next season. ‘He put the options to me,’ said Button. ‘I just said yes.’ That night, he confesses, was a blur of celebration. Never mind that the deal involved an annual pay cut of about £4million, to £8m, he jumped at the chance to realise his father’s ambition for him — to race alongside Fernando Alonso, who has joined from Ferrari. Jenson Button (second left) is revealed as part of the McLaren 2015 line-up alongside Fernando Alonso (second right) and reserve driver Kevin Magnussen (centre) Alonso (left) joins McLaren from Ferrari while Button is staying put despite speculation about his future . On Thursday, Button, who only finally inked his new contract on Wednesday night, was still wreathed in smiles at the pair’s unveiling at McLaren’s Surrey headquarters. The man who was vying for Button’s seat, 22-year-old Dane Kevin Magnussen, handled himself manfully as he was paraded as the team’s test and reserve driver. He was given his bad news by Dennis on Tuesday. From being the long-term favourite to partner Alonso, his career had suddenly stalled. Button insists his heart has 'always been at McLaren' after signing a new contract with the F1 team . Alonso and Button pose inside McLaren's technology centre in Woking on Thursday morning . The 2009 world champion, Jenson Button, has been retained by McLaren for the 2015 season . Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso will re-join McLaren from Ferrari, having left in 2007 . Dennis tried to console Magnussen in his comments. ‘Look at his poor little face,’ he said at one point. It sounded more patronising than Dennis intended. And, after all, Magnussen was his original choice for the seat. So what happened? How did Button replace the Dane in McLaren’s affections? The answer seems to lie in the complicated boardroom dynamics at Woking. A well-placed source has told Sportsmail that the other shareholders, the Bahrain Sovereign Wealth Fund and Saudi Arabian businessman Mansour Ojjeh, who has fallen out with his old friend Dennis, combined to save Button from the sack. Button in action for McLaren during the final Grand Prix of the 2014 season in Abu Dhabi last month . Kevin Magnussen faces an uncertain future after missing out on McLaren seat in 2015 . The ins and outs were not important on Thursday amid the smiles and back-slapping. Button, one of the most popular and respected drivers on the grid, said: ‘This is where my heart has always been — racing with such an amazing partnership. ‘And I have enormous respect for Fernando. I don’t want to mention my late father (John) too much but, probably as much as me winning the world championship, he wanted me and Fernando to race on the same team together.’ Alonso’s arrival at the Woking-based team, on a three-year deal worth £75m, was in the pipeline long before the McLaren hierarchy decided on Button’s future. ‘Secret’ conversations between the team and Alonso began in September 2013, though he admits he was only truly convinced to move this past summer. Alonso’s return is somewhat surprising given the acrimonious year he spent at McLaren in 2007. ‘That experience meant that something wasn’t right in my career,’ said the Spaniard. ‘It’s time to change that.’ Dennis’s take on the upheavals was to apportion blame on the ‘immaturity’ of Alonso’s then team-mate Lewis Hamilton. He said: ‘If you go down the “who struck the first blow?” route, I would say Lewis.’ Button won the world title with Brawn back in 2009 and has been at McLaren since 2010 .

"Kris Commons has branded Celtic’s contract offer unacceptable - and confirmed he wants a longer deal to stay at Parkhead. The 31-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and it’s understood a 12-month extension is all that has been put forward to date. Commons - being tracked by Crystal Palace, Leicester and Bolton - is adamant he wants to remain with Ronny Deila’s side but made it clear better terms will have to be put forward. Kris Commons (centre) believes his latest contract offer from Celtic is unacceptable . Speaking after he scored in Thursday night’s disappointing 4-3 Europa League defeat to Dinamo Zagreb, Commons said: ‘Where do we stand at the moment? I really don’t know. A lot has been said in the press and I don’t want to add more fuel to the fire. ‘Has an offer been made? Not that I want to sign. ‘It’s not in my hands. It’s down to the club, the board, the manager. If they want me here, they’ll keep me here. ‘I’ve reiterated many times that I want to stay here. I’ve loved playing football for Celtic and have a great rapport with the fans. ‘I’ve enjoyed four very successful years but there comes a time when you do need your future sorted out and the clock is ticking. ‘No doubt they deem the offer at the minute is something they feel is worthy of myself. But that’s where the sticking point is. I think I warrant something else.’ Asked if it was about the length of the contract rather than finance, Commons replied: ‘Yes.’ Commons in action during Celtic's 4-3 Europa League defeat against Dinamo Zagreb . Deila admitted recently that Celtic had to be careful about offering lengthier deals to older players. And the current impasse leaves it looking all the more likely that Commons’ time at the club could be nearing its end. After the Zagreb defeat, Deila was more immediately concerned by Celtic’s defensive frailties in the dead rubber in Croatia. Aghast that his team had scored three goals - through Commons, Stefan Scepovic and an own goal from Josip Pvaric - but still lost the match, the Norwegian insisted his players would have to improve ahead of the knockout stages. ‘It was a poor performance. We were not 100 per cent and there was a lack of intensity and aggression,’ said Deila, whose team had already qualified for the last-32 as Group D runners-up. ‘It was disappointing we weren’t up for the game. We scored three goals, that was a positive and I think the substitutes (Darnell Fisher, Liam Henderson and Anthony Stokes) were positive when they came on, but defensively we gave away too many chances and conceded four goals. ‘You should win when you score three goals away in Europe. Commons is adamant he wants to remain with Celtic but made it clear better terms will have to be put forward . ‘Individually, there were some bad performances but also as a team. As a back four we dropped too much and there was a lot of space between the defence and midfield. They (Dinamo) got three chances from that at the start of the second-half. ‘We were talking before the game about being compact and no balls in between us and we didn’t get that at the beginning of the second half. ‘We were too open, that was the problem. We had the chance to win at 2-1 and it was disappointing we gave away the victory. Ronny Deila's side were beaten by Dinamo Zagreb in the dead rubber match on Thursday night . ‘We have to take this with us to the next stage. We have the players but we have to think about the formation when we play away in Europe and what kind of players we use. We were more offensive than we have been and we conceded too many goals.’ Admitting he will have a re-think on tactics once he finds out who Celtic have drawn on Monday - with Everton or Spurs potential opponents - Deila added: ‘We have to be a lot, lot better in the next round. ‘We will have players back who will give us more spirit so I am not frightened about that. But it was disappointing to give the victory away like we did, from being 2-1 up.’","Kris Commons admits he isn't happy with Celtic contract offer .

"Tottenham finished second in Group C of the Europa League after a disappointing 1-0 defeat by Besiktas at the Ataturk Stadium. Sportsmail's Adam Shergold rated the players' performances on Thursday night. Tottenham . Michel Vorm  6 . Had nothing apart from a few misguided crosses to deal with in the first-half as Tottenham kept the occasional Besiktas threat at bay with ease. Beaten at close quarters by Cenk Tosun for the goal but was let down by his defence. Kyle Walker 7.5 . Making a very welcome return after nine months out with an abdominal problem. Involved from the outset and offered a useful outlet for Tottenham with his surges down the right-wing. Clearly still has that ability to beat his man and cross. A very encouraging return. Vlad Chiriches  6.5 . Dealt with everything thrown his way during a first-half in which Tottenham’s defence was rarely troubled. Cleared the ball on six occasions and made nine interceptions to block off the Besiktas supply lines. Kyle Walker of Tottenham is chased by Ramon de Moraes Motta of Besiktas at the Ataturk Stadium . Younes Kaboul  7 . Effective in mopping up at the back, looking composed when in possession and playing the ball out from the back. Good with aerial clearances as ever and got his head on Paulinho’s free-kick to tee up Soldado for a gilt-edged chance that he wasted. Danny Rose  7 . Very lively during the opening stages, taking Besiktas on down the left and using pace to beat his man. Had a chance midway through the second half that didn’t trouble Zengin in goal. Benjamin Stambouli  6 . Came within an insole of getting a touch towards the Besiktas goal in the early stages. Was largely accurate with his passing and dictated the tempo in the midfield. Recovered possession on half-a-dozen occasions and was tenacious in challenges. Tottenham's Danny Rose is muscled off the ball by Besiktas's Kerim Koyunlu Frei . Mousa Dembele  6.5 . Played a nice through ball to set Soldado free down the right channel on 23 minutes but nothing came of it. Was able to drive powerfully through the middle on a number of occasions. Andros Townsend  6.5 . Not too many glimpses of his lightning best but was afforded respect by the Besiktas defence. Lovely through ball into Soldado just after the half hour but the Spaniard fluffed his line. Paulinho 6.5 . Delivered some good corners and free-kicks which caused problems for the Besiktas defence during the first-half. From one, Kaboul nodded down to set up Soldado. Was less effective after the break and went off on 69 minutes. Belgian Mousa Dembele is challenged by Besiktas's Turkish midfielder Necip Uysal . Nacer Chadli  6.5 . Swung in an early left-sided cross that narrowly evaded the head of Soldado and looked a handful in the penalty box. Produced a cheeky finish on 25 minutes but was correctly flagged offside. Saw a chance early on bobble tamely into the hands of Tolga Zengin. Was given more licence to push forward after Paulinho and Soldado went off but couldn’t grab a leveller. Roberto Soldado  5 . The striker’s misses once again cost Tottenham. He had a golden opportunity in the first half when Kaboul met Paulinho’s lofted free-kick and put a chance on a plate for him. Soldado swung and barely connected. And when Townsend played him clear shortly afterwards, he shot straight at the keeper. Disappointing once again. Spanish striker Roberto Soldado spurns a chance as Besiktas goalkeeper Tolga Zengin saves his shot . Subs . Aaron Lennon (for Paulinho 70) - Didn’t have many chances to get up to full power. 6 . Erik Lamela (for Soldado 69) - Tried to release Chadli but the ball ran through to the keeper. 6 . Etienne Capoue (for Walker 75) - Not much time to make an impact. Subs not used .

"‘Where I come from,’ says the man standing between Amir Khan and his mega-fight with Floyd Mayweather, ‘it’s not good to be cocky.’ Where Devon Alexander comes from is St Louis, a 15-minute drive from the combustible town of Ferguson in which riots against white police killing unarmed black men have fanned out across America. ‘Where I come from,’ Alexander continues with cutting reference to growing up on the mean streets, ‘you don’t brag that you’re better than everyone. Because in our communities we believe nobody is better than anybody.’ VIDEO Scroll down to see Alexander trash talk Khan's level of  support in the UK . Amir Khan and Devon Alexander square up to each other during their final pre-fight press conference . Alexander has slammed Khan's arrogance ahead of their clash at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas . The 27-year-old American claimed that if Khan was really as good as he says he is he wouldn't need to brag . There is no doubting at whom the message is aimed. But to make sure, Alexander drives it home: ‘I’ve not been around Khan much but I hear a lot about him. And what I hear - even from boxing fans in the UK - is that he’s arrogant. A lot of people hate him. That’s the feed back. Not cool. ‘If you’re as good as he says he is you don’t have to tell everyone. You don’t gloat. Because the cockier you are the harder you fall.’ The shrewd odds-makers in the Las Vegas casinos do not expect Khan to fall in the MGM Grand Garden on Saturday night. They quote Bolton’s 28-year-old at 1-3 on, Alexander at 2-1 against. As Alexander The Great held court in a luxury box overlooking the MGM sports book he jerked a thumb in the direction of the giant screens behind him and said: ‘The odds are not important. Any more than they would be important if they favoured me. They only matter to the gambler. And if you’re going to have a bet, put it on me.’ Khan poses with for photos with two women during the press conference in Las Vegas . Alexander said even UK boxing fans were happy to admit that Bolton-born  Khan was a narcissist . Oscar De La Hoya’s Golden Boy promotions, who represent both fighters, would reportedly prefer Khan to win . Nor does it concern him that for all Oscar De La Hoya’s unfailing respect for all fighting men, his Golden Boy promotion company want Khan to win. Alexander says: ‘I sense the preference. But when I win it will not be an upset in my mind. And if it upsets their plans, hard luck.’ Clearly the design is for Khan not only to defeat his fellow former world champion but to do so in such spectacular style that the public will demand Mayweather finally gives him his shot at the really big time. Alexander smiles at that notion and says: ‘He hasn’t done anything in our sport to deserve the big fight with Floyd. He’s had a lot gimmes in his career. Look at my resume – constant back to back fights against the best.’ The perceived wisdom here is that Khan’s lighting speed, light-footed movement and eradication of his old mistakes under new trainer Virgil Hunter will prevail. To which Alexander responds thus: . ‘Speed? I’m fast too. ‘Movement? I move a lot. ‘Mistakes? He still makes them.’ Alexander claimed his track record showed consistent bouts against the best opposition available . The St Louis-born fighter said he could match his British opponent both in terms of speed and movement . Alexander insisted that whoever won between him and Khan deserves a shot at Floyd Mayweather Jnr . Alexander comes from the classically tough background of the black American fighter. Where he comes from, to be precise, is Hyde Park. The one in London is more leafy and fashionable than the neighbourhood in St Louis, which is most commonly described as ‘down-trodden, rough, drug-riddled and gang-infested.’ He is the star graduate of the gritty gym in Ferguson at which his wise old trainer Kevin Cunningham offered boys an alternative to running with the street gangs. Like Khan, Alexander turned professional at 17, albeit not with an Olympic medal to show for his fine amateur career. Now he becomes the first professional Khan will have fought who is younger than himself. By two months. Alexander, too, is excited to be topping the bill at the MGM Grand Garden ‘the Mecca of boxing.’ Unlike Khan, this will be his first appearance in Las Vegas. Will the winner, no matter which of them, deserve to fight Mayweather? ‘Sure.’ he says. ‘Why not?’ He answers his own question and when he does so you can tell he senses that even if he is victorious he may not be granted that enriching gift: ‘Even after I beat Khan he may still be the one to get the call. Because he brings UK television money to the table.’ Young men who fight their way out of Riotstown USA never forget their economic reality. Khan speaks to the press ahead of his 33rd career fight, he has only lost three so far . Bookmakers have Khan favourite at 1-3 on, his opponent Alexander is at 2-1 against . Many believe Khan's new trainer, Virgil Hunter (left), will help him eradicate his usual mistakes .

"A holidaymaker used his  camera to record the frightening moment a mother elephant and her  calf angrily chased a Jeep full of safari tourists in Africa. The nature lovers were traveling through Zambia's Lower Zambezi National Park when the heart-stopping encounter occurred. Anthon van Dijk, from the Netherlands, pulled out his camera as the tourists' vehicle narrowly escaped being rammed and flipped by the protective mum.

According to Anthon, the mother made several mock charges before finally giving chase - with her calf in tow. His footage shows the safari driver speeding away it in a bid to outrun the elephant. The terrified passengers can be heard yelling 'Please, please, please' as the elephant refuses to give up the chase. Dutch tourists were visiting Zambia's Lower Zambezi National Park when the encounter happened . Anthon, who was on a safari with his son Levi, said: 'In these national parks, what is seen quite often is that the Jeeps for these trips drive with high speed towards a predator sighting. 'This makes the elephants who are passed close by with high speed not so happy. 'We noticed this Jeep-phobia with a lot of elephants in the park.' A tourist said the calf outran its mother at one point before the holidaymakers managed to escape . He added: 'In the video you see a female with her young. We'd seen several mock charges, but this was a full charge by mother and child. 'The little one was trumpeting as well and even outrunning the mother in the chase, as you can hear in the video.

"It was lost over 100 years ago in what many consider the worst maritime disaster in San Francisco history. On Feb. 22, 1901, in a dense morning fog, the SS City of Rio de Janeiro struck jagged rocks near the Golden Gate Bridge and sank almost immediately, killing 128 of the 210 passengers and crew aboard the ship. The ship was never found - until now. The CodaOctopus 3-D Echoscope sonar images of the SS City of Rio De Janeiro, which reveal it on the seabed for the first time since it sank without trace on Feb. 22, 1901, in a dense morning fog. The ships parts are clearly visible, even though it is in 287 feet of water, positioned inside the main ship channel, and buried in mud. The NOAA and partners today released three-dimensional sonar maps and images of the immigrant steamship. 'We are undertaking this exploration of the San Francisco Bay in part to learn more about its maritime heritage as well as to test recent advances in technology that will allow us to better protect and understand the rich stories found beneath the Bay's waters,' said James Delgado, director of maritime heritage for NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries. The images also revealed that the ship did not, as rumoured, contain treasure. City of Rio de Janeiro was rumored to be full of silver treasure, but Delgado said accounts of a shipment of 'Chinese silver' were actually bars of tin. 'Today the wreck is broken and filled with mud, and it is a sealed grave in fast, dangerous waters in the main shipping lanes,' he said. A Present day photo at the entrance of the Golden Gate looking westward with Fort Point at the far left where the SS City of Rio de Janeiro struck the rocks and foundered on February 22, 1901. Where it was found: The area is in the centre of the image, which also shows two other shipwrecks,  City of Chester and Fernstream. On February 22, 1901 the SS City of Rio de Janeiro was enveloped in thick morning fog while moving through the narrow entrance of the Golden Gate Bridge. Without warning the ship struck Fort Point. At the time of the stranding, an ebbing tide pushed the steamer back from the bridge and off the rocks. The SS City of Rio de Janeiro built by John Roach & Son in 1878 at Chester, Penn. regularly transported passengers and cargo between Asia and San Francisco, photo taken at Nagasaki, Japan, 1894. It was also used as a military boat, right, when during the Spanish American War, the U.S. Government charted Pacific Mail Steamship Company steamships as troopships. The ship's bulkheads were not watertight, so it rapidly flooded, sinking within 10 minutes. Many of the passengers, most of them Chinese and Japanese emigrants, were asleep in their cabins and died below. Of the 210 on board, 128 lives were lost, making this shipwreck the highest loss of life at the Golden Gate Bridge. The ship is considered by historians as the 'Titanic of the Golden Gate' Fishermen in the area, hearing the ship's distress calls, helped rescue 82 survivors, many plucked from makeshift rafts and floating wreckage.

The dead included Chinese and Japanese immigrants as well as the U.S. Consul-General in Hong Kong, who was returning to the U.S. on leave with his wife and two children. The entire family died in the tragedy. City of Rio de Janeiro, launched in 1878, joined the fleet of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, carrying passengers and freight to and from San Francisco, Honolulu, Yokohama, Japan and Hong Kong as America expanded into the Far East and Pacific after the Civil War. Most Americans whose ancestors came to the United States from the Far East in the 19th and early 20th centuries to start a new life arrived on ships like City of Rio de Janeiro.

In November, Hibbard Inshore and Bay Marine Services donated a research vessel and crew, along with a high-powered remotely operated vehicle, to help NOAA pinpoint and map the City of Rio de Janeiro wreck site using sonar developed by Coda Octopus. California-based salvagers found the wreck in the 1980s, but its exact location was unknown as the coordinates they provided did not coincide with any wreck charted by NOAA through years of sonar work. During this expedition, Robert Schwemmer, West Coast Regional Maritime Heritage Coordinator, worked with Delgado and multibeam sonar expert Gary Fabian to locate the wreck site again. They located the site in 287 feet of water, positioned inside the main ship channel, and largely buried in mud. Schwemmer and the Hibbard team captured the first detailed sonar and three-dimensional images of City of Rio resting in the dark, muddy waters outside the bridge. 'The level of detail and clarity from the sonar survey is amazing,' Schwemmer said. 'We now have a much better sense of both wrecks, and of how they not only sank, but what has happened to them since their loss.' The 3-D model generated by the Coda Octopus 'Echoscope' sonar also gave researchers an entirely new perspective on the condition of the wreck site. What they found was a crumpled, scarcely recognizable iron hulk encased in more than a century worth of mud and sediment, lending support to the narrative that the ship sank quickly before many of its passengers could escape. Bay Marine Services LLC, research vessel Eaglet with Hibbard Inshore LLC Saab Sabertooth Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) / Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) equipped with Coda Octopus 3-D Echoscope sonar, which was used to create the amazing images. The expedition team also remapped the S.S. City of Chester,a second nearby wreck that was rediscovered in May 2013 by NOAA's Office of the Coast Survey. In stark contrast to the City of Rio, the Echoscope revealed in great detail the surprising level of preservation of the City of Chester's frame and propulsion machinery, telling a very different story about the circumstances of its sinking. To date NOAA has plotted nine of nearly 200 ships including four never before found vessels. The NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries Maritime Heritage Program is engaged in a two-year study to discover and document shipwrecks in Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary and nearby Golden Gate National Recreation Area.","Accident dubbed 'Titanic of the Golden Gate' and  many consider it worst maritime disaster in San Francisco history .

"It was a meeting of the minds, rather than fists, as David Haye sat for breakfast with former heavyweight rival Vital Klitschko on Thursday. Haye uploaded a photo via his Instagram account later that afternoon with the pair all smiles at a table as they dined at one of London's Park Plaza Hotels. The 34-year-old accompanied the picture with the caption: 'Great tasty @KX_Life breakfast at the beautiful @ParkPlazaHotels with Vitali klitschko, talking all things family, politics & BIG FIGHTS 2015/16,' as the British boxer hinted that he is closer to making a comeback in the sport. David Haye (right) sat down for breakfast with heavyweight boxing rival Vitali Klitschko on Thursday . The 'Hayemaker' has not fought since his fifth-round knockout of Dereck Chisora at Upton Park in 2012. But the popular Londoner, who faced the threat of retirement, is understood to be keen to return to the ring after a positive recuperation from reconstrcutive shoulder surgery. Haye's dalliance with Klitschko though will raise eyebrows after their very-much public war of words in the past. Haye (right) has not fought since his fifth-round knockout of Dereck Chisora at Upton Park in 2012 . In 2009, Haye incensed the then-WBA heavyweight champion and his younger brother Wladimir by sporting a T-shirt of him holding aloft the severed heads of the Ukrainian duo as he sought a fight with either sibling. Two years later, Haye finally got his wish as he fought Wladimir in a unification bout for for the WBA, WBO, IBF, IBO and the Ring heavyweight titles. In the build-up to that fight, which Haye lost comfortably on points, the Londoner insisted he had no regrets about that shirt hailing it one his best ever moves. 'Do I regret that T-shirt? Hell no! No way! It was one of the best things I've ever done,' he said. 'That decapitation T-shirt was one of the smartest business moves I've ever made.'

Haye (right) incensed the Klitschko family when in 2009 he wore a T-shirt of him holding aloft the severed heads of the brothers, in a bid to get a fight with either of them . Even last year, Haye insisted his comeback to boxing would only happen if he fought either Klitschko - something Vitali was adamant would only ever happen on his terms. 'Last September [2012] I gave a proposal to David Haye to fight me in Moscow. David Haye had a contract and didn't want to do that and instead of fighting me he fought Chisora,' he said. 'How long [should] I have to wait for David Haye? I gave him a proposal and he didn't take it. 'David Haye had the chance to fight my brother. Many times he ran away but Wladimir beat him. 'David did not agree with the decision, tried to make excuses and just talked about his leg not giving him the chance to beat my brother.' But any hopes of Haye fighting the older Klitschko appear over for now at present, with the 43-year-old has vacating his title in December 2013 in order to focus on political matters in his homeland - where he is the current Mayor of Kiev.

"Tottenham have been fined 15,000 euros (£11,870) by UEFA over the three pitch invasions during the Europa League match against Partizan Belgrade. The match at White Hart Lane on November 27 was suspended four minutes before half-time following three separate pitch invasions, which appeared to be orchestrated. UEFA's control, ethics and disciplinary body (CEDB) dealt with the case and on Thursday announced the fine against Spurs, who won the match 1-0. Three men were charged over a pitch invasion during Spurs' Europa League clash with Partizan Belgrade . The first pitch invader was on the field for five minutes and managed to take a selfie with Kyle Naughton . The three pitch invaders wore T-shirts bearing the name of a headphone manufacturer associated with Spurs and six other Premier League teams. Three men were charged by police over the pitch invasions, the last of which caused the match to be delayed for around 10 minutes just before half-time. Nathaniel Thompson, 23, Helder Gomes, 22, and Daniel Jarvis, 26, were arrested after encroaching onto the pitch in what appeared at the time to be an orchestrated PR stunt by a headphone manufacturer which produces licensed Spurs merchandise. Two of them appeared to attempt to take 'selfie' photographs on handheld devices. Spurs striker Roberto Soldado looked to strip one of the invaders of his T-shirt, which like those worn by the other two intruders bore the name of headphone manufacturer BassBuds. The company issued a statement via Facebook condemning the actions, saying it was 'appalled' that the match was interrupted in such a manner and claimed an online hidden camera prank show they were working with had gone rogue. Neither Soldado or Moussa Dembele faced action from UEFA for their attempts to stop the pitch invaders.

"Physically unimposing but allergic to giving the ball away, Xavi Hernandez will go down as Spain's greatest ever player, the man who best represented a generation that won three major international trophies back-to-back, and rivaled the Brazil 1970 side for the accolade of ‘best ever’. He was in Vienna in 2008 when Spain ended its 44-year wait for a trophy winning the Euros, he was in Johannesburg two years later as they became World Champions, and in Kiev in 2012 as they completed the hat-trick. He was also in Nigeria in 1999 alongside Iker Casillas as the seeds of senior success were sown with an Under-20 World Cup triumph. Spain’s golden era started with his emergence and in Brazil it appeared to have ended with his demise. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Xavi say goodbye to David de Gea after World Cup . End of the line: Xavi, pictured here in action against Holland at the 2014 World Cup, won 133 caps for his country . Game over: Xavi has decided to retire from international football after Spain's disastrous World Cup campaign . Plenty to smile about: The midfielder helped Spain win Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine . Champions: Xavi also played a key role as Spain won their first World Cup in South Africa in 2010 . Left out of the third group game against . Australia his last two matches were a 2-0 defeat to Chile and a 5-1 . reverse against Louis van Gaal’s Netherlands. But those losses will be . forgotten long before the victories in Austria, South Africa and . Ukraine. Spain were terminal big-tournament failures in 2008 – a different hard luck story every two years – and Luis Aragones was an unpopular coach going into the tournament having ousted Real Madrid legend Raul and handed leadership responsibilities to Barcelona midfielder Xavi. The pay-back came throughout the tournament but none more so than in the final when his clever lofted pass over the German defence on the half hour put Fernando Torres through to beat Jens Lehmann for the only goal of the game. At 28-years of age that might have been the peak for Xavi but he was only just getting started. Two years later he swaggered through the World Cup picking holes in the rival defences that now tended to line up eight-men deep against the Spanish. He got his hands on the World Cup after Andres Iniesta scored the winner against the Dutch and would stand alongside him a few month later on the Ballon d’Or podium. Many Spain fans still see it as an injustice that he finished third and not first in the voting. In the European Championship two years . later there were signs that the old midfield metronome was staring to . lose time but he kept his place all the way to the final and produced . one of his best ever performances in Spain’s perfect 4-0 victory over .

Younger days: Xavi tussles with an opposition player during a World Cup clash with South Africa in 2002 . Praise: Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher (right) has described Xavi as the best midfielder he has ever seen . It’s not just his football that will be missed from the international stage – a willingness to talk about the beautiful game has always made him stand out from his contemporaries. He was interviewed by Sportsmail in 2011 and engaged for over an hour on the differences between the English and the Spanish game displaying all the intelligence off the pitch that he has shown for, first Aragones and then Vicente del Bosque, on it. For such an important player he also managed to remain understated in the most dramatic of circumstances. In the World Cup semi-final against Germany in 2010 with just two minutes left the match referee asked him if he could have his shirt after the game. 'If you blow the whistle a minute early it’s yours,' was his reply. There were times when his willingness to talk football upset some who found Spain’s domination tiresome. He was fond of talking about his team’s ‘superiority’ on the pitch though more often that not that meant numerical superiority, with so much of their success due to always having the extra man in all areas of the pitch. Battle: Xavi shone as Spain comfortably defeated Italy to be crowned European champions in 2012 . Back of the net: Xavi pounces to score against Russia in the Euro 2008 semi-finals against Russia . And Xavi was so often that extra man, appearing for a team-mate receiving and then moving the ball on. ‘I get the ball, I give the ball, I get the ball, I give the ball’ as his club coach at Barcelona, Pep Guardiola, once put it. At the 2010 World Cup he played 599 accurate passes with a 91 per cent success rate. It will be a long time before that kind of relentless domination of possession is seen again.

"This is the shocking moment an undercover cop pulled a gun on Micheal Brown protesters in Oakland. The cop  had been marching with the demonstrators on Wednesday night, but pointed his pistol at protesters after he and his partner were attacked. KTVU reported that demonstrators screamed at the undercover officers during the march 'Hey, they're undercover, they're cops!' The officers' faces were masked at the time, the affiliate station reported. Scroll down for video . Incident: An undercover police officer, who had been marching with the demonstrators, pointing his pistol at protesters after he and his partner were attacked . Tense: About 20 uniformed officers were quickly on the scene and detained one man . The hollering continued when the officers tried leaving, KTVU reported. An undercover officer shoved a demonstrator to the side, before the demonstrator shoved him, the affiliate station reported. The man was reportedly handcuffed and brought down on the ground. The other officer brandished his weapon after demonstrators started to surround the two men, KTVU reported. About 20 uniformed officers were quickly on the scene and detained one man. Demonstrators broke windows and looted stores and that there was one arrest for assaulting an officer in the latest U.S. protest over police violence. Oakland and neighboring Berkeley have seen nightly demonstrations since the weekend in response to decisions by two grand juries not to charge white police officers in the killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City. On Wednesday night, about 150 protesters, a smaller crowd than on previous evenings, left the campus of University of California-Berkeley and demonstrated without incident before marching south into Oakland, the city of Oakland said in a statement. Arrest: A spokesman for the Oakland Police Department said only that it had responded to a request for assistance 'made by an outside agency,' and referred all inquiries about the incident to the California Highway Patrol . By that point, the protesters' numbers had dwindled to about 50 people, the statement said, some of whom broke windows at a T-Mobile store and a Chase bank. Looting also was reported in an area of small businesses at a downtown intersection, it said. A spokesman for the Oakland Police Department said only that it had responded to a request for assistance 'made by an outside agency,' and referred all inquiries about the incident to the California Highway Patrol. Lt. Chris Bolton with the Oakland Police Department tweeted early Thursday morning 'The #OaklandProtest pictured man isn't an OPD officer & not an OPD arrest. OPD 1st responded to scene on report from other agency. 1/1.' '2/2 That outside agency has been notified to provide details and address concerns re #OaklandProtest concerns.' He later tweeted, 'Last night #OaklandPolice responded to a request for help during a California Highway Patrol arrest at Bay & Harrison St. (1/2)' '2/2 #OaklandPolice PIO is referring all inquiries regarding this incident to the California Highway Patrol.' Bolton answered a Twitter user's query, and said 'Yes, it was a CHP arrest conducted by CHP officers.' CHP media officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Before the incident, demonstrators reportedly screamed at the undercover officers 'Hey, they're undercover, they're cops!' Twitter user Dave Id also published a series of tweets online about the incident early Thursday morning. 'March definitely OOO-VER!' he wrote. 'But I got better info from direct eyewitnesses on undercover incident... #Oakland #BerkeleyProtests.' He also said 'Tall 6'8"" undercover and shorter 5'8"" undercover with mask on were confronted in dark part of 27th street. Tall cop pulled out baton...' A third tweet from Id alleged 'Tall cop quickly threw baton on ground and then pulled out gun, holding it sideways all gangster. Someone then clocked the masked cop...' He also claimed that 'Masked undercover wasn't beaten badly as I first heard from witness further away, but hit straight in face and knocked down...' The City of Oakland said in a statement one arrest was made overnight after an officer was assaulted, but it was not immediately clear whether that was same incident witnessed by the Reuters photographer. Two subway stations in downtown Oakland were shut down for a time late on Wednesday due to the protest, city officials said. On previous evenings this week in the Bay Area, riot police have fired tear gas and pepper spray to disperse demonstrators, some of whom have thrown stones at the officers. The protests are part of nationwide actions by activists amid turmoil over the policing of black communities.

"Lego has been accused of racism by the Turkish community over a Star Wars toy allegedly depicting  a mosque. The critics claim that the Jabba's Palace model, part of Lego's Star Wars range, offends Muslims as it resembles the Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul - one of the world's most renowned mosques. Members of the Turkish Cultural Community of Austria group also accused the toy manufacturer of depicting Asians as having 'deceitful and criminal personalities'. Toy: The Jabba's Palace Lego set will cease to be produced from 2014 after the Turkish Cultural Community of Austria group described it as offensive to the Muslim community . Criticism: The group criticised Lego's design saying it resembles the Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul, one of the world's most recognisable mosques . The group has released a statement calling for an apology from Lego for its cultural insensitivity. The Lego set is based on the home of Jabba the Hutt, a central character in the Star Wars series, who lives in a domed palace, with a separated watchtower. As well as bearing a likeness to the Hagia Sophia mosque, the Turkish group also claimed the toy takes its design from the Jami al-Kabir mosque in Beirut - while the watchtower is said to resemble a minaret. A post on the community's website contains a picture of the slug-like creature's Lego home, pointing out similarities with the Istanbul mosque. Outraged . Muslims have criticised the toy producer on the community's website, accusing it of deliberately placing contextual errors in the toy. The case came to light when a Turkish man expressed his dissatisfaction with the toy after it was purchased for his son by a family member. After investigating, Dr Melissa Günes, . General Secretary of the Turkish Cultural Community, said that Lego . had been contacted with an official complaint. Comparisons: A post appeared on the group's website pointing out features of the Lego set and comparing them to the Istanbul mosque . A statement posted on the organisation's website refers to Jabba the Hutt as a 'terrorist' and says that he 'likes to smoke hookah and have his victims killed'. It adds: 'It is clear that the ugly figure of Jabba and the whole scene smacks of racial prejudice and vulgar insinuations against Asians and Orientals as people with deceitful and criminal personalities.' The statement says that the figures in the set are made to resemble 'terrorists, criminals and murderers'. Referring to weapons contained in the set, the statement suggests that the 'combination of temple building and bunker . facilities where shots are fired cannot be appropriate for children . between 9 and 14 years old'. It concludes: 'One would expect more . empathy and responsibility from a manufacturer of toys that has produced . toys and models that are good for teaching for decades.' Jabba's Palace as depicted in the 1983 Star Wars film Return of the Jedi . The organisation also says it is planning . legal action in Austria, Germany and Turkey against the toy firm if it does not get a satisfactory response. Lego's Katharina Sasse said: 'The Lego Star Wars product Jabba´s Palace does not reflect any actually existing buildings, people, or the mentioned mosque. 'The Lego mini-figures are all modelled on characters from the movie. 'We regret that the product has caused the members of the Turkish cultural community to come to a wrong interpretation, but point out that when designing the product only the fictional content of the Star Wars saga were referred to.' The Hagia Sophia was first built around 360AD in the Byzantium capital Constantinople, later Istanbul. It served as an Eastern Orthodox Cathedral and was the world's largest for nearly a thousand years, until Seville Cathedral was completed in 1520.In 1453, Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Turks under Sultan Mehmed II, who ordered the building converted into a mosque.Christian symbols such as the bells and altar were removed and many of the mosaics were plastered over. Islamic features, such as the four minarets, were added while it was in the possession of the Ottomans.It remained a mosque until 1931 when it was closed to the public for four years. It re-opened in 1935 as a museum by the Republic of Turkey.It is famous for its massive dome and is considered the crowning achievement of Byzantine architecture. Some experts say it 'changed the history of architecture'.","Turkish Community Forum issued statement criticising toy manufacturer .

"A French court today ordered Twitter to hand over the identities of racist and anti-Semitic users to the police. In a test case which will have widespread implications for the millions who tweet every day, the Tribunal de Grande Instance ruled it unacceptable for people to post hateful material anonymously. This was despite lawyers for the hugely popular micro-blogging site refusing to assist detectives. Offensive: A French court has ordered Twitter to hand over the identities of racist and anti-Semitic users after the hashtag #unbonjuif (#agoodjew) went viral in France last year . Jewish students brought the case, saying Twitter had a moral duty to name and shame hateful posters. It follows a massive increase in the number of anti-Semitic tweets appearing across France. In October, the student bodies asked Twitter to remove a number of messages which appeared under the hashtag #unbonjuif (#agoodjew), with vicious examples including: '#agoodjew is a dead Jew.’ The hashtag became the third most popular in France, with thousands attacking the religion. France, which has a shameful history of . anti-Semitism behind it, now has a number of strict laws aimed at . combatting hate crimes. Precedent: In a test case which will have widespread implications for the millions who tweet every day, the Tribunal de Grande Instance (above) ruled it unacceptable for people to post hateful material anonymously . The Union of Jewish Students of France (UEJF) and three other similar groups now want Twitter to hand over the names of all those responsible so they can be prosecuted. Alexandre Neri, Twitter’s French barrister, had told the court that Twitter 'data is collected and stored in the United States’ – namely in San Francisco, where the site is based. Ms Neri said that Twitter was accordingly 'subject to US law’, adding: 'Should I submit myself to the law of a different country to where I work? I don’t know.’ Suggesting that there was a 'huge void, a question mark’ in the law, Ms Neri suggested that only an American judge could decide whether a US company should hand over data to the French authorities. Stephane Lilti, counsel for the Jewish groups, in turn said Twitter had a 'commerical interest’ in protecting the anonymity of its users. 'Twitter is playing a commercial game by raising a number of legal hurdles to not having to comply with its legal obligations,’ said Mr Lilti. Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud handed down the verdict following deliberations lasting two weeks. Last year, Twitter shut down an account run by a German neo-Nazi group based in Hanover, following a request by German police. Facebook and YouTube complied with similar requests. Before today’s ruling, a spokesman for Twitter said it always suspends accounts when they are illegal, or in breach of its rules, but would not hand over details of account holders unless ordered by a judge.","Test case to have widespread implications for millions who tweet every day .

"The truck driver who crashed into comedian Tracy Morgan's limo is fighting back against a civil lawsuit filed by the former '30 Rock' star and his friends who survived the wreck. In new court documents filed this week, Walmart truck driver Kevin Roper requested to pause the civil suit until his criminal case for the crash is over. Morgan and friends were riding home from a comedy show in June when Roper struck them with his tractor-trailer on the New Jersey turnpike, killing limo passenger James McNair and leaving Morgan with a traumatic brain injury. A month after the crash, Morgan and the survivors  filed a civil lawsuit against Walmart, blaming the company for allowing a 'sleep-deprived' driver on the road. Scroll down for video . Stop the suit: Walmart truck driver Kevin Roper (left) is petitioning to pause a civil lawsuit filed by Tracy Morgan (right) after the comedian and three friends were injured in a crash this past summer. Morgan pictured above last week, outside a New Jersey post office . In his latest letter to the court, Roper's lawyer David Glassman writes that if the civil case continues it may influence the jury's decision in his criminal case since the crash, and Morgan's slow recovery, have been widely covered in the news. Glassman even accuses Morgan and his friends of going on a 'media campaign'. Roper is currently faced with the prospect of 30 years in jail, if he is convicted on charges of death by auto and four counts of assault by auto. In the bitter back and fourth between both legal teams, Morgan's lawyers recently wrote that there was a 'lack of civility' in the case. Roper's lawyer shot back at this statement, writing that it wasn't very civil to file a lawsuit  back in July when McNair's family was still grieving. 'In fact, it would be safe to conclude that Plaintiffs' filing has established a new speed record for the tolling of the Statute of Limitations in civil actions,' Glassman wrote. Scene: Morgan and friends were returning from a comedy show in Delaware when their limo bus was rammed by Roper's Walmart truck. Morgan's friend and fellow comedian James McNair was killed in the crash . Deadly: In their civil suit, Morgan and the other survivors of the crash claim that Roper was sleep deprived when he got into the wreck . Earlier this month, Morgan and his attorneys accused Walmart of stalling in a federal lawsuit that have brought against the company over their safety practices after it was reported that Roper was asleep at the wheel at the time of the crash. Following the incident, Roper took to Twitter to deny claims he was under the influence at the time of the accident, saying; 'I was never charged at the scene of the accident because once again i was not guilty of any crime. Not until all the TV cameras came.' The Georgia resident also stated that he felt 'horrible' and 'wished it was him who was hurt' before writing; 'So yes i am now most likely f****d because i had an unfortunate ACCIDENT with the wrong car that night.' This latest legal drama comes just a week after Morgan was seen struggling to walk on an outing to the post office with his fianceé Megan Wollover. The actor was leaning on a walker as he slowly moved down the sidewalk and said he was still 'fighting every day' after being involved the crash, which claimed the life of his friend James McNair and injured three others. It was just the third time the actor has been seen in public since the horrifying car accident this past June. Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury as well as a broken leg, a broken nose and broken ribs in the accident. His attorney has revealed that Morgan is still struggling to simply return 'to the way he was' after this trauma. Last week, Morgan appeared a far cry from the extroverted and gregarious characters he has played on film and television, and was barely audible as he spoke to a nearby photographer. At one point as he returned to his car from the post office, the actor even had to briefly stop and catch his breath before moving on. In addition to his fianceé he was also accompanied by an aide who was there to help him get into the car. Morgan was critically injured in early June when a Walmart tractor-trailer rammed into a limousine bus he and his friends were travelling in on the New Jersey Turnpike. The comedian, known for his roles on Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock, was returning home to New York City from a show at a Delaware casino. He spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home, and the extent of his brain injury is still unknown. 'He's fighting to get better, and if there's a chance for him to be back to the Tracy Morgan he once was, he's going to try to do that,' said his lawyer Benedict Morelli last month. 'But we just don't know because of the severity of the injuries that he sustained and the fact that he had such a severe brain injury.' Serious charges: Roper faces up to 30 years in prison is convicted on charges of death by auto and four counts of assault by auto. Pictured above in New Jersey court on June 11, 2014 . The actor did appear much better than the last time he was spotted back in October being pushed in a wheelchair. Morgan was forced to put an FX series he had in development on hold after the accident, though his new film with Chris Rock, Take Five, will be released this month. He came out against Walmart in a public statement this past September after they accused him of being at fault during the accident for not wearing a seatbelt. 'I can't believe Walmart is blaming me for an accident they caused,' he said at the time. 'I'm fighting hard every day to get back.' Out of work: Morgan has been unable to work since the crash, but a movie he filmed before the accident, Take Five, is set to hit theaters this week.

"Buried at the back of his ankle and the front of his sole, the disintegrated parts of a metre long worm that had been living in a man’s foot for more than four years are shown in a gruesome X-ray. The 38-year-old Sudanese migrant, who lives in Melbourne, had no idea he had the flesh eating parasite inside his body. The remains of the lengthy guinea worm are clearly shown in an X-ray taken at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney. Scroll down for video . WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGE BELOW . The disintegrated parts of a worm are shown buried at the back of his ankle and the front of his sole . The man, who arrived in Australia four years ago, visited doctors complaining of a swollen foot after it had been painful for about a year, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Infectious diseases physician Dr Jonathan Darby explained that the X-ray showed two pieces of curled up ‘Guinea worm’ in the man’s ankle and foot. He said the creature had probably died and started to degenerate inside the man’s body. Normally the worms live in the intestines and enter the body via larvae in infected drinking water. They dig through flesh and set themselves free through a blister on the skin. The worms dig through flesh and set themselves free through a blister on the skin . ‘That whole process can take years. It can sit inside the human body alive for years or die, degenerate, and then cause problems in the area like it did for our patient,’ Dr Darby said. The guinea worm is a nematode that causes dracunculiasis, also known as guinea worm disease. The parasite, which is found in Southern Sudan, Ethiopia, Ghana and Chad, cannot be treated but neither can it infect anyone else. The man has made a full recovery after the worm was removed during surgery. Earlier this a Chinese women was horrified to discover she had a an 8ft tapeworm living inside her. The woman, known only as Mrs Li, is thought to have picked up the worm from eating undercooked meat while travelling in South East Asia earlier this year. She has now had the worm removed but says the thought of it still makes her feel ill. She told Chinese media: ‘It’s disgusting and almost makes me faint.’ Mrs Li, who is in her 30s and lives in Xiamen, in China’s Fujian Province, visited a doctor after she started to feel unwell and noticed unusual fluids in her stools. Sometimes there are no symptoms for tapeworms but signs can include nausea, weakness, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hunger or loss of appetite, fatigue, weight loss and vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Tapeworms have a three-stage lifecycle including an egg stage where the larva first gets in the body and an adult stage at which the worm can produce more eggs.","The 38-year-old Sudanese migrant had no idea it was inside his body .

"Republicans have muscled a $1.1 trillion bill financing government agencies through the House after President Barack Obama phoned Democratic lawmakers and urged them to back the measure. The House approved the measure late Thursday by 219-206, hours before a midnight deadline, avoiding a government shutdown. The compromise bill keeps agencies funded through next September.

President Barack Obama phoned Democratic lawmakers and urged them to back the$1.1trillion bill that will keep government agencies funded through next September . Many conservatives opposed it because it did not block Obama's recent executive actions on immigration. A large majority of House Democrats opposed it because of provisions easing some restrictions on banks and allowing higher political contributions by big donors. Obama backed the bill and called wavering Democratic lawmakers to persuade them to help it pass. The bill must now be approved by the Democratic-run Senate.

"An Australian photographer has sold one of his images for a record-breaking $US6.5 million ($A7.87 million). Award-winning Peter Lik, 55, who was born in Melbourne, sold the world's most expensive photograph to an unnamed buyer this earlier week. The black and white photo 'Phantom', which shows a ghostlike shape in a light beam within Arizona's Antelope Canyon, was sold along with two other images for a total of $US10 million ($A12.1 million). Scroll down for video . Black and white photo 'Phantom' taken by Peter Lik sold for a record-breaking $US6.5 million ($A7.87 million) A private buyer and long-time collector of Lik's works also purchased 'Eternal Moods' for $US1.1 million . A private buyer and long-time collector of Lik's works also purchased his images 'Illusion' for $US2.4 million and 'Eternal Moods' for $US1.1 million. Including a previous $US1 million sale of his picture 'One' in 2012, Lik's works make up four of the top 20 most expensive photographs ever sold. Some commentators have raised questions over the validity of the price tag because it has not been independently verified. But lawyers acting on behalf of Lik and the buyer say the figure is correct. The buyer's lawyer Joshua Roth, from Glaser Weil, said he was unable to provide documentation because the terms of the contracts were 'strictly confidential'. 'I can assure you that the sale was made but unfortunately that's the best I can do,' Mr Roth told Daily Mail Australia. 'It may seem like an unbelievable number but it's a unique picture by the artist and Mr. Lik normally makes only editioned artworks. Lik, 55, was born and grew up in Melbourne in Australia but moved to the U.S. in 1984 . An unnamed collector, who has a number of Lik's works, also bought 'Illusion' for $US2.4 million . 'This was, in the opinion of the artist and our client, the most important photo Mr. Lik ever shot.' Lik said certain textures and contours found in nature lended themselves beautifully to black and white photography. 'The purpose of all my photos is to capture the power of nature and convey it in a way that inspires someone to feel passionate and connected to the image,' he said. 'The intensity of contrasting light and dark spaces was surprising, but made for some of the most powerful images I've ever created.' Lik's passion for photography began during his childhood in Australia, where he grew up the son of Czech immigrants. He took his first photo at eight years old after his parents gave him a Brownie Kodak camera and he snapped a picture of a spider web in his backyard. In 1984, the then-25-year-old moved to the U.S., where he developed a passion for landscape photography and the panoramic camera.","Peter Lik sold the world's most expensive photo to an unnamed buyer .

"Formula One has to consider bringing in enclosed cockpits to improve driver safety following the serious accident involving Jules Bianchi, says Williams deputy team principal Claire Williams. Autosport magazine claimed F1's top teams rejected a move by the FIA last year to introduce closed cockpits because they felt the structures would make cars look ugly. Williams refused to confirm if that had been rejected but said the enclosed cockpits now had to be looked at. The idea of closed cockpits has been raised in light of Jules Bianchi's crash at the Japan Grand Prix . Speaking at the Leaders in Sport conference in London, she said: 'I can't talk about what we discussed in our strategy group meetings. But safety is always on the agenda in Formula One. 'Enclosed cockpits aren't easy technically for us to integrate into a Formula One car and of course they change the very nature of what a Formula One car looks like. 'We have to look at all the options available to us whether it's an enclosed cockpit or not, but I think those conversations need to go on behind the scenes. Claire Williams, deputy team principal of the Williams F1 team, said drivers safety was of paramount importance . 'Safety is always paramount so we have to find ways to ensure our drivers are as protected as possible and I don't think the aesthetics of a Formula One car - yes they are important, they are the very fibre and DNA of Formula One - and what cars look like is important, but safety has to be paramount.' Bianchi remains in a 'critical but stable' condition after he suffered a traumatic brain injury during a crash in last Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix. The 25-year-old Frenchman, who drives for Marussia, remains on the intensive care unit at Mie General Medical Center in Japan. Marussia driver Bianchi spun off the road in treacherously wet conditions in Japan, and is still in hospital . Williams said safety in Formula One had moved on hugely since the death of Ayrton Senna 20 years ago. She added: 'Our sport is dangerous at times, but a lot of work has been done behind the scenes in the past 20 years since Ayrton died at Imola in '94. 'You see a lot of accidents in Formula One where you don't necessarily expect drivers to walk away and certainly prior to 20 years ago they wouldn't necessarily have done so. But a lot of work has been done and they do walk away in most scenarios now. 'The FIA and the event organisers need to do a full analysis into the accident that happened on Sunday and I think everyone's concern in our sport at the moment is with Jules and his recovery.'","Jules Bianchi suffered serious head injuries after Japan Grand Prix crash .

"Vice President Joe Biden just can't catch a break this week, coming under fire on Wednesday for calling an Asian politician 'the wisest man in the Orient' just hours after apologizing for using an anti-Semitic slur in a speech the previous day. Biden was speaking at the kickoff of the Nuns on the bus tour in Des Moines, Iowa, on Wednesday when he made his second racially insensitive comment of the week. While telling a story about Singapore's first prime minister, Biden said, 'You know on the way back from Mumbai ... I stopped in Singapore to meet with a guy named Lee Kuan Yew who most foreign policy experts around the world say is the wisest man in the Orient.' The terms 'orient' and 'oriental' are generally appropriate for describing inanimate objects but not people. Scroll down for video . While speaking during the kickoff of the Nuns on the Bus tour on Wednesday at the Statehouse in Des Moines, Iowa, Biden referred to Singapore's first prime minister as 'the wisest man in the Orient' Biden, pictured here greeting supporters with Sister Simone Campbell, left, had just apologized earlier that day via a written statement for calling predatory money lenders 'Shylocks' Biden signs his name on the Nuns on the Bus tour bus during a stop on Wednesday in Des Moines . Biden's inappropriate comment on Wednesday followed a written statement released earlier in the from the Vice President denouncing the word 'Sholock.' The gaffe-prone VP had used it to describe predatory bankers who loan money to U.S. troops in a speech the day before. The term, which derives from the name of a vicious money-lending character in Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice', is considered anti-Semitic, and Biden had been criticized on Tuesday by the National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, for using it. Foxman said Biden's actions were shameful and he 'should have been more careful.' 'When someone as friendly to the Jewish community and open and tolerant an individual as is Vice President Joe Biden, uses the term ""Shylocked"" to describe unscrupulous moneylenders dealing with service men and women, we see once again how deeply embedded this stereotype about Jews is in society,' Foxman said. In a statement provided to Business Insider on Wednesday, Biden described Foxman as a longtime 'friend and advisor' and said he agreed with his assessment. 'He’s correct, it was a poor choice of words, particularly as he said coming from ""someone as friendly to the Jewish community and open and tolerant an individual as is Vice President Joe Biden."" 'He’s right,' Biden added. Biden had been praising the Legal Services Corporation during a Washington speech marking it's 40th anniversary when he made the offending remark. Recounting how people would speak to his son, Beau, about financial and legal difficulties when he was serving in Iraq, Biden said: 'People would come to him and talk about what was happening to them at home in terms of foreclosures, in terms of bad loans that were being... I mean these Shylocks who took advantage of these women and men while overseas.' The VP rode with the nuns to the Waveland Cafe in Des Moines and had lunch with them after the kickoff event . The Vice President is known for making race-related slip-ups, having described Barack Obama in 2007 as 'the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,'' Talking about his home state of Delaware in 2006, he said: 'You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.'","Attempting to praise Singapore's first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, Biden called him the 'wisest man in the Orient'

"On a list of things we never wanted to know about  celebrities, it probably ranks as number one. Children’s TV entertainers The Krankies have revealed their sordid past as secret swingers. The former stars of hit shows such as Crackerjack confessed they each had a string of lovers in their heyday. Thumbs up: Ian and Janette Tough, who play Wee Jimmy and Ian Krankie, admitted in a radio interview they have both been openly unfaithful to each other . When innocent youngsters had finished chuckling at the on-stage antics of Scots-born comic Janette Tough impersonating a wee schoolboy, she and her husband Ian  went backstage for some Krankie hanky panky. At one point Janette had an affair with a circus leopard tamer while Ian carried on with the act’s glamorous assistant. Dancers, magicians and musicians were among their conquests; and at the height of their fame in the 1970s and 1980s, they said, they adopted an ‘anywhere, anytime’ attitude to sex, listing golf courses and a cross-Channel outing in a 12ft boat among their al fresco encounters. True, a 4ft 5in cross-dressing comic and a bloke who plays her dad may not feature among the nation’s best-known sex gods. But the 64-year-old couple’s disclosure of the debauched lifestyle they once led rocked the world of showbiz to its very foundations yesterday after a wincingly candid interview for Scottish radio. Janette, famous for her portrayal of Wee Jimmy Krankie as a pre-pubescent schoolboy in blazer and cap, told BBC Radio Scotland’s Stark Talk programme they were openly unfaithful with a succession of partners. Krankies’ tours, they claimed, were ‘wilder than rock tours’. Free-thinking: The husband and wife duo admitted yesterday they had an 'anywhere, anytime' attitude to sex including on golf courses (pictured here in 2004) On tour: The pair say their swinging was only conducted on tour and stopped after they realised they were 'playing with fire' Having a ‘ding-dong’ with someone, as they phrased it, was routine. They enjoyed ‘a very active and physical relationship’. Once they trashed a coach loaned to them by rock group Status Quo. On another occasion, they had a ‘ding-dong’ at sea. ‘It was only a little 12ft boat,’ said Janette. ‘We went out for Sunday lunch one day and we thought we’d get a bit romantic. We nearly ended up in France. He said he couldn’t make it last that long now.’ Of their exploits with other partners, Janette said: ‘We weren’t behind each other’s back. We knew what each other was up to.’ Their dalliances were apparently revealed when Janette noticed glitter from the assistant’s leotard on her husband’s body – and  Ian complained his wife smelled  of leopards. Of his philandering Ian said: ‘We were in our early thirties and we got fame and went a bit berserk. Luckily we didn’t get in to the drugs, but we were wild.’ Strong team: Ian and wife Janette Tough said their wild days are now firmly behind them . The couple met at the age of 18 and married three years later. At one point they were rated among the most sought after entertainers on children’s TV, appearing on Crackerjack before headlining in Krankies Klub and their own long-running show. They were effectively dumped by British TV in the 1990s. Curiously (thankfully, even) their current website makes no mention of the period they call their ‘dirty thirties’. But it does feature a snapshot of their 2004 autobiography ‘Fan-Dabi-Dozi – our amazing true story’, in which similar disclosures first surfaced. In the interview Ian also confirmed that he once punched TV magician Paul Daniels in a bar in Jersey, where the duo were performing, adding: ‘But that’s not really a bad thing is it? Friends again: The Krankies (pictured bottom) admit they did fall out with Paul Daniels (middle row far left) after Ian punched him (pictured with Frank Carson (top left), Jimmy Cricket, Bobby Ball, Tommy Cannon, and (centre) Jane Fryer . ‘I think he must have said something to contradict something I was saying. I’d likely had a drink and was talking rubbish and I just went “bang”. ‘He went off the chair and the whole bar all applauded and said “it’s time somebody did that”.’ Janette said she was aware their confessions would shock fans  but said she simply wanted to tell the truth. She said they had never thought of leaving each other. ‘But that didn’t stop us having fun with other people,’ she said. Why court publicity about it now after more than 40 years in showbiz? Ah yes. They’re appearing in panto. And Jimmy is releasing a five-track CD. It’s entitled Dirty Wee Boy.","The Krankies admit to sordid sexual past .

"Perhaps the only surprising thing is that it’s taken this long for the usual suspects to come out and start bashing the artistic triumph of the year. But then, it really must stick in the craw of our metropolitan cultural elite that after all those years of championing so much talentless twaddle — pickled sharks, unmade beds, etc — along comes a work of art which really does capture the public imagination. It’s a dazzling exercise in originality and creativity which has already attracted four million visitors. And, horror of horrors, it’s about war. Not only that, it has been produced by an artist who has never even made it to the shortlist of that exalted yardstick of contemporary art, the Turner Prize. Worse still, Paul Cummins’s ceramic poppies, now filling the moat of the Tower of London as a memorial to every British and colonial serviceman who died in the Great War, have been installed in a royal fortress. And the public — those ungrateful, ill-educated fools — have been queueing up in their thousands every day just to catch a glimpse. The poppy display at the Tower of London has attracted thousands of visitors - but one critic has trashed the stunning work as 'fake' The poppies are now filling the moat of the Tower as a memorial to every British and colonial serviceman who died in the Great War . But former Turner Prize judge Jonathan Jones, art critic of the Guardian, said the work was an 'inward-looking, Ukip-type memorial' He wrote: ‘The moat of the Tower should be filled with barbed wire and bones. That would mean something' Now, a former Turner Prize judge can stand it no longer. Jonathan Jones, art critic of the Guardian, has trashed the work as a ‘fake, inward-looking, Ukip-type memorial’ which demeans us all. ‘It is deeply disturbing that a hundred years on from 1914, we can only mark this terrible war as a national tragedy,’ he writes on the Guardian website. ‘What does it say about Britain in 2014 that we still narrowly remember our own dead and do not mourn the German or French or Russian victims? It’s the inward-looking mood that lets Ukip thrive.’ He goes on to attack the ‘fake nobility’ of this ‘deeply aestheticised, prettified and toothless war memorial’. Dismissing the entire thing as ‘a lie’, he suggests a replacement: ‘The moat of the Tower should be filled with barbed wire and bones. That would mean something.’ Many will be astonished that anyone could politicise this magnificent project, any more than someone might quibble with the Cenotaph. Some chapters in the history of this country are of such a different order and magnitude that they transcend the petty squabbles of Left and Right. The death of close to a million men and women in the Great War is one of them. So too, for that matter, were this year’s commemorations of the 70th anniversary of D-Day. We mark these moments not to enshrine some political doctrine, and certainly not to celebrate victory, but simply to express our thanks to those who made the ultimate sacrifice. In doing so, we honour the eternal pledge: ‘We will remember them.’ Yet there will always be that bien pensant strand among our chattering classes who simply ‘know better’ and cannot allow such moments to pass without imposing their oh-so-enlightened contemporary take on it all. As it happens, after reading Mr Jones’s words, I remembered that he also dismissed the new Bomber Command Memorial (backed by generous Daily Mail readers) as ‘crass’ and ‘a nasty piece of artistic jingoism’. Not that the bomber boys had cause to worry. That has also turned out to be a phenomenally popular addition to the London landscape. But then, this is the same critic who, earlier this month, likened Tracey Emin (of unmade bed fame) to Michelangelo. With thousands flocking to the site each day to see the emerging 888,246 poppies, many will be astonished that anyone could politicise this magnificent project . The work, created by Paul Cummins, is to simply express thanks to those who made the ultimate sacrifice - without political agenda . The exhibition (left), called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, has attracted massive crowds (right), particularly during half-term . The sea of crimson poppies can be seen from The View From The Shard - a beacon of colour in the more grey London surroundings . George Orwell’s famous dictum — ‘it is unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during “God save the King” than of stealing from a poor box’ — remains as true today as it was when he wrote it during the Second World War. Why is it that the Left have such a loathing for home-grown patriotism while they are so keen to salute it elsewhere? Why is it still thought to be cool (after all these years) to have that clapped-out hero of the Cuban revolution, Che Guevara, on your wall or your T-shirt, while decrying ‘Thatcher the warmonger’ for liberating the Falklands? Even among the centre Left, there is sometimes a sense that all this commemoration stuff is a bit phoney. Tony Blair saw nothing wrong with merging the 60th anniversaries of VE Day and VJ Day in 2005 into a single, non-specific event to save time and money. The veterans were appalled, yet the Prime Minister of the day could not understand why. Back in the Seventies, the Left were urging us all to ‘move on’ and downgrade Armistice Day. In 1982, after the Falklands War, the BBC decided to switch conductors after musical director Mark Elder had called for the abolition of ‘jingoistic’ flag-waving at the Last Night of the Proms. Even today, there are strident voices insisting that the school curriculum should no longer teach 1918 as a ‘victory’. And nothing gets this Leftie lot going quite like a poppy. Whether it’s the right-on crowd who insist on wearing white poppies (to honour pacifism) in the run-up to Remembrance Sunday or those, like Channel 4’s Jon Snow, who refuse to wear one at all (on grounds of ‘poppy fascism’), there will always be some people who want to be different. No one should dispute their right to do so. Such freedoms of expression are why those wars were fought in the first place. Even the protester who burnt poppies in front of Royal British Legion fundraisers outside the Royal Albert Hall on Armistice Day 2010 — shouting ‘Burn in hell, British soldiers’ — was only fined £50 for threatening behaviour (he’d have been fined more if he’d parked on a double yellow line while doing so). But that doesn’t mean we should let patronising side-swipes pass unchallenged. The Queen was so impressed with the ceramic installation that she and the Duke of Edinburgh had a private tour . Her Majesty looked contemplative as she toured the poppies earlier this month. The poppies will be sold to raise money for charity . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the memorial alongside Prince Harry, walking through the now-colourful dry moat . So what if the sea of poppies at the Tower is a British commemoration? Every nation honours the dead in its own way. Think of the profoundly moving tradition which takes place every night of every year in Belgium. Except for the duration of the Second World War, the buglers of the Ypres Fire Brigade have appeared each evening at the town’s Menin Gate. There, the traffic stops and the people of this proud town salute all the British who fell in Flanders. To date, I have never heard anyone condemn them as a bunch of Ukip-supporting simpletons. Maybe it’s only a matter of time. The Tower of London project was dreamt up by ceramicist Paul Cummins only a year ago, as he pondered a fitting tribute for the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. His idea was to plant a ceramic poppy for every British and colonial serviceman who died in the Great War, then sell them to raise funds for charities linked to the Armed Forces. The trustees of Historic Royal Palaces, which runs the Tower of London, quickly embraced the idea. More than that, the Tower authorities have created a ritual whereby, every night, the names of dead soldiers are recited from a lectern overlooking the poppies. Anyone can nominate a loved one. In stirring scenes, Joey, the star of War Horse, also visited the poppies - one of several high profile visitors to the installation . Visitors have been taking photos in their thousands to document the snippet of history now laid out in central London . The project has attracted enormous international attention, despite Mr Jones's assertions that it is nationalistic . Mr Jones also attacked the ‘fake nobility’ of this ‘deeply aestheticised, prettified and toothless war memorial’, calling it 'a lie' The whole project is an idea which so impressed the Queen that she asked for a guided tour. And despite Jonathan Jones’s assertion that it is a nationalistic, Brits-only affair, it has attracted enormous international attention. The man from the Guardian had not even planned to see it. ‘I accidentally got swept into a tide of humanity at the weekend, or to put it another way, couldn’t move for crowds,’ he wrote. ‘What was going on? Why were so many people choking the streets of the City of London, where shops are closed on Saturdays?’ How frightful for the poor chap. Well, I just so happened to be down there myself during this same weekend. I saw the poppies back in the summer and wanted to bring my children before the whole thing disappears in a fortnight. And I could think of no better way to impress upon them the enormity of the Great War than to show them this crimson moat and explain that every single one of the 888,246 poppies equals a real person who lived and died for this country. It is an image which will be imprinted on countless young minds for many years to come. Yet after Armistice Day on November 11, the poppies will be uprooted, cleaned and dispatched to the people who have paid £25 for each one. Within weeks, this extraordinary display will be gone, unlike Damien Hirst’s pickled shark and Tracey Emin’s unmade bed, which will for better or worse live on to delight future generations. Which, though, will most people remember 100 years from now?","Temporary war memorial Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red at Tower of London has attracted thousands of visitors .

The prop lashed out at Cockerill in a press conference and slammed the East Midlands club for the way they dealt with his move to Toulon in June 2013 after spending seven seasons with Leicester. 'I thought f****** Leicester were f****** amateur,' said Castrogiovanni. 'He was saying that people go for the money but he has a lot of f****** squad players who get paid as well. I paid my own f****** money to leave this club. I don't need the money to play rugby. I love this game and I used to love this club. Martin Castrogiovanni (right) launched a verbal tirade against his old boss Richard Cockerill on Sunday . 'I still love this club but I never want to speak with Cockers any more. I am not fake. If I hate you, if you have been a ****, I will never speak to you again. I don't hate anyone. Peace and love. I just don't like ****s.' Reigning European champions Toulon have apologised for Castrogiovanni's five-minute rant which Cockerill has branded petulant. The Italian was infuriated by claims from Leicester that he left Welford Road last summer in search of a pay rise. 'I never had the opportunity to defend myself when I left,' added the 33-year-old prop. Tigers coach Cockerill is dismayed by the comments and claims they have sullied Castrogiovanni's standing . 'Cockers talks about the money, but the real reason I left this club is because you have Cole and you have me. Cole paid gets paid half the money from the RFU and I am foreign. 'You have a good f****** tighthead prop playing for England and a hairy, fat Italian. The thing is that they made it look like I went for the money but I paid £100,000 from my pocket to leave this club because I want to play rugby. That's it.' Toulon have also said they are investigating Steffon's brother Delon, with claims suggesting the full-back threatened to 'take the face off' a Leicester supporter during the half-time break on Sunday. With the Armitages and Castrogiovanni currently all available for Saturday's clash in Toulon against the Tigers, it could add an extra edge to an already intriguing heavyweight clash. Delon Armitage allegedly threatened to 'take the face off' a Leicester supporter at half-time last Sunday .

"A Chinese telecommunications equipment company has sold Iran's largest telecom firm a powerful surveillance system capable of monitoring landline, mobile and internet communications, interviews and contract documents show. The system was part of a 98.6 million euro ($130.6 million) contract for networking equipment supplied by Shenzhen, China-based ZTE Corp to the Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI), according to the documents. Government-controlled TCI has a near monopoly on Iran's landline telephone services and much of Iran's internet traffic is required to flow through its network. Big deal: The HQ of Chinese company ZTE which has reportedly signed a $130 million dollar deal to supply Iran with hi-tech surveillance equipment . The ZTE-TCI deal, signed in December 2010, illustrates how despite tightening global sanctions, Iran still manages to obtain sophisticated technology, including systems that can be used to crack down on dissidents. Human rights groups say they have documented numerous cases in which the Iranian government tracked down and arrested critics by monitoring their telephone calls or internet activities. Iran this month set up a Supreme Council of Cyberspace, headed by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who said it would protect ""against internet evils,"" according to Iranian state television. In control: President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has a firm grip on communications networks in Iran . Mahmoud Tadjallimehr, a former telecommunications project manager in Iran who has worked for major European and Chinese equipment makers, said the ZTE system supplied to TCI was 'country-wide' and was 'far more capable of monitoring citizens than I have ever seen in other equipment"" sold by other companies to Iran. He said its capabilities included being able ""to locate users, intercept their voice, text messaging ... emails, chat conversations or web access.' The ZTE-TCI documents also disclose a backdoor way Iran apparently obtains U.S. technology despite a longtime American ban on non-humanitarian sales to Iran - by purchasing them through a Chinese company. ZTE's 907-page 'Packing List,' dated July 24, 2011, includes hardware and software products from some of America's best-known tech companies, including Microsoft Corp, Hewlett-Packard Co, Oracle Corp, Cisco Systems Inc, Dell Inc, Juniper Networks Inc and Symantec Corp. ZTE has partnerships with some of the U.S. firms. In interviews, all of the companies said they had no knowledge of the TCI deal. Several - including HP, Dell, Cisco and Juniper - said in statements they were launching internal investigations after learning about the contract from Reuters. Big brother: The new kit will give Iran the ability to more closely monitor the internet . Li Erjian, a ZTE spokesman in China, said his company only sells . ""standard"" equipment to Iran. ""Our main focus for business in Iran is to . provide standard communications and network solutions for commercial . use to help operators upgrade their network. 'We are a small scale telecommunication equipment supplier in the Iran market. We sell standard equipment in Iran as we do globally,' he wrote in an email. TCI officials in Tehran either didn't respond to requests for comment or could not be reached. The United States, Europe and many Arab countries accuse Iran of attempting to develop nuclear weapons, which Iran denies. But Beijing, along with Moscow, has repeatedly vetoed attempts to strengthen sanctions against Tehran. China is Iran's largest trading partner with business between the countries surpassing $45 billion last year, up $16 billion from 2010, according to Iran's FARS news agency. ZTE, China's second largest telecom equipment maker, is publicly traded but its largest shareholder is a Chinese state-owned enterprise. The fast-growing firm, which says it sells equipment to more than 500 carriers in more than 160 countries, reported annual revenue of $10.6 billion in 2010. TCI is owned by the Iranian government and a private consortium with reported ties to Iran's elite special-forces unit, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. In a recent interview Mahmoud Khosravi, managing director of Iran's government-controlled Telecommunications Infrastructure Company, boasted that sanctions have had no effect on Iran's telecom industry. 'We have the latest technology in our networks,' he said.","Iran able to obtain sophisticated technology despite tightening global sanctions .

"He wasn't drafted, people mispronounce his name, and he had no idea where he was going when he was ushered into the room for his first big NFL postgame news conference. But Larry Donnell can find the end zone. And, once he gets there, all he has to do is turn his 6ft 6in, 265-pound body around and haul in the pass from Eli Manning. It happened three times in the first half on Thursday night in the New York Giants' 45-14 victory over the Washington Redskins. 'You set your goals high,' Donnell said. 'I didn't expect it to come so quick, but it has.' Larry Donnell was understandably all smiles as he left the field following his hat-trick of touchdowns in the New York Giants' 45-14 win over the Washington Redskins . The Redskins' inside linebacker Perry Riley can do nothing to prevent Donnell collecting a touchdown pass in spectacular acrobatic fashion . Donnell has become quarterback Eli Manning's top receiver, taking in passes of five, six and six yards to set New York on course for victory in the capital . Manning successfully completed 28 of 39 passes for 300 yards and even added a short-range touchdown of his own as New York's revival continued . He has become Manning's top receiver, the perfect target in the team's new dink-and-dunk offense. The second-year tight end out of Grambling State caught twisting grabs of five, six and six yards, touchdowns so similar he had trouble differentiating them in his mind. 'They all tie into each other,' he said. 'Every time I think about one, I just smile from ear to ear, man. It's just a great feeling. When we're down there, you make eyes with Eli, you know he's about to throw it.' After struggling in his first two games running new offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo's West Coast playbook, Manning has led the Giants (2-2) to consecutive victories. Manning is supposed to complete 70 percent of his passes in this offense, and he surpassed that mark against the Redskins, going 28 for 39 — including three simple open-field drops — for 300 yards with four touchdowns and one interception. Manning also ran for a one-yard score, as did Andre Williams, and the Giants forced six turnovers. Manning completes a fourth quarter play from one yard out to set the seal on New York's comprehensive victory, taking their season record to 2-2 . Donnell was the star of the show, however, as the second year tight end with the 6ft 6in, 265-pound frame demonstrated he can locate the end zone . New York wide receiver Victor Cruz is sent tumbling head over heels after a hit from Redskins free safety Ryan Clark during the second quarter . 'That was the whole thing, to be able to leave here tonight and be 2-2 and 1-0 in the division. That was huge,' New York coach Tom Coughlin said. 'It's exciting to be in the hunt, and by being able to come out of here with a win, hopefully we have a chance to be.' Donnell — it's pronounced 'don-EHL', not 'DON-ehl' — beat a trio of defenders for his hat-trick of touchdowns: linebacker Perry Riley, safety Brandon Meriweather and rookie cornerback Baushad Breeland. They barely knew what hit them. 'He's better than what we thought,' Meriweather said. 'And by the time we made that adjustment, he was three touchdowns in.' Donnell finished with seven catches for 54 yards. He had only one career touchdown catch entering the game, but he now leads the Giants this season in TD catches (four) and overall receptions (25). Daniel Fells had a two-yard scoring catch in the third quarter, which means tight ends have snagged seven of Manning's nine TD passes this season. New York's Victor Cruz added six catches for 108 yards, his second consecutive 100-yard game. Giants tackle Will Beatty stops Redskins inside linebacker Keenan Robinson in his tracks as New York asserted their authority on the contest . Eli Manning tries to locate a gap in the Redskins defence with one of his trademark pin-point throws . Alfred Morris enters the end zone for Washington in the third quarter but the match was already beyond their grasp thanks to New York's lightning-fast start . Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins turns out of the pocket during the first half - he finished with 19 completed passes out of 33 and 257 yards made . Kirk Cousins and his receivers weren't anywhere near as efficient for the Redskins, whose six giveaways led to 31 points for the Giants. A strip-sack by Mathias Kiwanuka set up New York's first touchdown, Trumaine McBride's strip of tight end Logan Paulsen after a catch ended a Washington drive deep in New York territory, and Prince Amukamara, Quinten Demps, McBride and Antrel Rolle intercepted Cousins' passes in the second half. 'I've got to look at my play,' Cousins said, 'because that was killing us at the end there.' Cousins, who has the starting job while Robert Griffin III recovers from a dislocated ankle, finished 19 for 33 for 257 yards with four interceptions and a fumble for first-year coach Jay Gruden's Redskins (1-3), who dropped into the cellar in the NFC East, already two-and-a-half games behind the unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles. Cousins threw three interceptions in a span of five attempts in the second half; Griffin has never thrown three picks in an entire game. 'Their coaches had them ready to play. We didn't have our team ready to play,' Gruden said. 'We were abysmal offensively and defensively and it showed.' Donnell, meanwhile, was asked if he kept the balls from his touchdown catches as souvenirs. 'Nah,' he answered. 'There's more coming.' The Washington Redskins cheerleaders entertain the crowd during the game in Landover .","Larry Donnell took in three short-range touchdown passes from Eli Manning during the first-half to set the New York Giants on course for a comfortable 45-14 victory at the Washington Redskins on Thursday night .

"The cost of paying gold-plated pensions to Britain’s public sector workers will double over the next six years to the equivalent of £1,500 per family, a damning report warns today. Between April 2011 and April 2012, the net cost of paying the pensions of retired State workers was £8billion. But this figure is set to rocket to £16.2billion in 2017/18, according to the forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s independent watchdog. The cost of paying gold-plated pensions to Britain¿s public sector workers will double over the next six years to the equivalent of £1,500 per family . Experts said it makes a mockery of the Government’s claim to have tackled the problem of the ballooning cost of paying such generous pensions to the State workforce. It comes as unions are plotting strike action over changes to their pensions as well as other grievances. Members of the militant Public and Commercial Services union walked out on Budget Day and teachers are planning industrial action later this year. But the report by the think-tank the Centre for Policy Studies said the figures revealed ‘the true scale of the public sector victory in pension negotiations.’ Under the deal, hammered out between ministers and unions barons, public sector workers will have to work longer and pay more for their pensions and many will get less when they retire. But the figures show how the cost of public sector pensions continues to rise at a time when the majority of private sector workers do not have a single penny in a retirement pot. To make matters worse, it does not even represent the full cost to the taxpayer of paying the pensions of retired public sector workers. This is because it deducts the amount contributed by the employer into their workers’ pensions - but the ‘employer’ is the State, paid for by taxpayers. Figures show how the cost of public sector pensions, for health professionals and teachers for example, continues to rise at a time when the majority of private sector workers do not have a single penny in a retirement pot . In 2017/18, the employer contribution will be around £17.5billion, making a total of £33.7billion. Michael Johnson, a pensions analyst and author of the CPS research, predicts the total figure will be closer to £39billion. He said: ‘The annual cost of providing public service pensions will be over £1,500 per household by 2016 and rising rapidly.’ Mr Johnson raised his concerns about the potentially disastrous pledge by ministers not to make any further changes to public sector pensions for a quarter of a century. Tim Knox, director of the CPS, warned they are rising to such an extent that ‘they will soon represent a significant driver of the deficit.’ Lord Oakeshott said that public sector pensions are rising to an 'eye-watering' amount . Lord Oakeshott, a leading LibDem lord and a former pensions spokesman, said: ‘Public sector pensions costs are due to rise by an eye-watering amount every year. ‘Meanwhile private sector pensions are being squeezed and the Bank of England’s quantitative easing programme is hammering annuity rates for private savers. ‘Our coalition Government has only half defused the ticking public sector pensions time bomb Labour left us.’ It comes as gold-plated pensions in the private sector are being shut down at the fastest rate on record, according to the National Association of Pension Funds. In 2005, 43 per cent of defined benefit schemes allowed new recruits to a company to join. Today the figure has collapsed to just 13 per cent following the biggest-ever drop last year. A defined benefit pension promises to pay a worker a certain pension when they retire, typically linked to their final salary or their average salary over their career. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, the campaign group, said: ‘The growing burden of public sector pensions shows little sign of slowing despite government promises of reform. ‘Unions have vociferously resisted even moderate reforms and it is taxpayers who are paying the price for that. ‘We’re all living longer, and this bill isn’t getting any smaller.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Government’s package of reform will deliver £430billion of savings over the next fifty years, ensuring public service pensions are affordable and sustainable in the long-term. ‘The reformed pension schemes will rebalance the costs more fairly between employees, employers and the taxpayer, while protecting those nearest retirement and accrued rights.’","Last year the net cost of paying the pensions of retired State workers was £8billion .
That figure is set to more than double in 2017/18 according to a Treasury watchdog ."
"The father whose 21-year-old daughter successfully sued him for $16,000 college tuition has opened up about the painful ordeal. Michael Ricci has not seen his daughter Caitlyn - except in court - since she fled to her grandparents' house in February 2013 in a dispute over her alleged underage drinking. On Tuesday, almost two years later, a New Jersey judge ruled in Caitlyn's favor, ordering Mr Ricci and his ex-wife Maura McGarvey to pay for her college tuition. Today, in a diatribe against the New Jersey legal system and his own parents for fueling the ordeal, Mr Ricci has laid out his version of events. Scroll down for video . Estranged: Michael Ricci said he cries nightly thinking about the public conflict with his daughter Caitlyn . 'The entire thing makes me sick to my stomach,' Mr Ricci wrote in a first-person article for Yahoo Parenting. 'It makes my blood boil listening to a judge tell me that my daughter can go to any school in country she wants to, have no relationship with her parents, and we have to pay!' He adds: 'Most nights before I fall asleep, I have tears in my eyes thinking about the difficulty my family is going through... It’s certainly not what I wanted for my family.' The dispute, he claims, started with an attempt to put in 'boundaries' for Caitlyn, who was kicked out of a Disney internship when she was caught underage drinking. 'I understand that after she was kicked out of her Disney internship, a program she participated in to help prepare for college, she was upset and angry at the rules her mother and I set for her,' he explains. 'She was kicked out of the program for underage drinking, and so we had to set boundaries. That included chores, a curfew, and summer classes.' Fleeing to Mr Ricci's parents' home, Caitlyn refused to come home and enrolled at Temple University - which her parents didn't know about until they read it on Twitter. But Mr Ricci insists his anger is not directed at Caitlyn, but at his parents - and says critical comments that have been made about his daughter are 'horrible'. Defensive: Mr Ricci adds that the critical comments about his daughter are 'horrible' and he blames his parents for encouraging her to sue for tuition fee payments. He refuses to pay until she builds a relationship with him . He writes: 'Every day I wake up and miss my daughter. I miss talking to her, seeing her, asking her about her day, and being involved in her life. 'While I absolutely place blame on Caitlyn for this, the majority of it lies with her grandparents, who have fostered and even financed this debacle while she lives at their house. 'What kind of people encourage their granddaughter to sue her own parents…their son?' While Mr Ricci and Ms McGarvey agreed to pay $906 for Caitlyn's community college costs, they said they will not pay a single cent of the $16,000 until Caitlyn  tries to have a relationship with them. After they previously refused to pay, Caitlyn sued them for contempt of court. In his article, Mr Ricci condemned the legislation that orders divorced parents to pay for tuition but not married parents. After this week's hearing, he told ABC7: 'That's fine, they can hold me in contempt of court. 'They can do whatever they want. I'm not going to pay. I'm not going to give them any money until my daughter has a relationship with me and we start to heal our family.' Back in court: Caitlyn Ricci, who has sued her parents for her college tuition, returned to court this week (pictured) after they failed to pay up. Her grandfather, left, paid for her to sue her parents . Hurt: Maura McGarvey and Michael Ricci, pictured left, say their daughter only wants their money . Caitlyn left home in February 2013. McGarvey told the court that her daughter left after refusing to do chores and follow a curfew, which they enforced after she repeatedly got in trouble for underage drinking. But Caitlyn said she moved partly because of a dispute about taking a summer class. McGarvey explained they had enforced the summer class as punishment for Caitlyn getting kicked out of the Disney College Program - paid for by her and her ex-husband - for underage drinking. She moved in with her paternal grandparents in Cherry Hills, New Jersey and, despite their fallout, Maura said she tried to reach out to Caitlyn - sending her letters and writing her poems - but she never heard back. The parents claim she also purchased a car when she left the family home and subsequently demanded the money through her lawyers. Refusal: The parents, who divorced when Caitlyn was a toddler, said they will not pay until she attempts to have a relationship with them. She moved out of her mother's home nearly two years ago . Fallout: Caitlyn, a student at Temple University, says she left home after a dispute about summer classes, but her mother said they argued about chores and curfews set after Caitlyn was caught drinking . They eventually tried to file for an emancipation but the day before Mothers' Day last year, papers from Caitlyn's attorneys arrived at their home. The girl's grandparents - who have not spoken to their son in years - paid for her to get a lawyer to sue her parents. She sued them for her county college tuition in Pennsylvania in August 2013, then in October, she sued them for the tuition money for Temple. A judge ruled in her favor. 'I love that child more than anything,' McGarvey, 42, said in court this week. 'But she only wants the money.' Her daughter countered: 'It's not about the money. I want to go to college.' Caitlyn's mother fell pregnant with her while she was still at college and worked full time while also attending classes to care for her. She divorced Michael Ricci in 1997 and they have both remarried and have younger children. But they have maintained a good relationship and regularly chipped in so that Caitlyn could get the best, Maura claimed in online posts. McGarvey, an English teacher, and Michael Ricci, a high school basketball coach, have agreed to pay the county college tuition by January 1 but say they can't afford her out-of-state college tuition. Happier times: Both of Caitlyn's parents have remarried and have younger children . The couple say that their daughter, whom they have not spoken with in more than a year, did not apply for eligible loans and scholarships, but the student's attorney said she is has paid some of the $26,000 bill at Temple with financial aid. The couple are raising funds for their appeal through a GoFundme account. Caitlyn Ricci's attorney told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the parents' combined household income was more than $272,000 a year. 'Caitlyn really is a good girl,' attorney Andrew Rochester said. 'She is the nicest, sweetest girl. All she wants is to go to college.' The girl's grandfather said if his son and his ex-wife do not pay up, he believes they should go to jail.

"The Miami Dolphins touched down at Gatwick airport on Friday ahead of Sunday's Wembley showdown against Oakland Raiders in the first of three games in the capital this season. Having arrived in England, the Dolphins planned to practice on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, the Raiders arrived on Monday and have been getting over the jet lag by getting into their usual practice routine. As if a flight across the Atlantic Ocean to play a regular-season game wasn't distracting enough, the Miami Dolphins don't even seem to know who will be their starting quarterback.

Miami coach Joe Philbin has been asked repeatedly if quarterback Ryan Tannehill will start the game, but he has been noncommittal. However, ask Tannehill himself and you'll at least you get an answer. 'I'm taking the first snap of the game and playing the game,' Tannehill said. 'I'm prepared to my fullest and go out and try to put this team in a position to win games. Nothing has changed in my preparation or how I'm approaching this game.' Although the two teams have been an ocean apart all week, the Miami quarterback controversy is not lost on the Raiders defence. 'I don't want to get into what the quarterback is doing.' Raiders cornerback Carlos Rogers said on Thursday. 'They say he's still the starting quarterback of that team, so obviously it's not a backup that they trust, and he's going to be out there.' Ryan Tannehill is preparing for the game as usual but it is unknown whether the quarterback will start for Miami Dolphins against Oakland Raiders .

Running back Darren McFadden (second right) walks with his team-mates following their  practice session . Quarterbacks Derek Carr (left) and Matt McGloin (right) each practiced snap at Pennyhill Park on Friday . With everyone trying to pretend this is just a normal week of practice, perhaps the best plan of action for the Oakland Raiders is to embrace the abnormality of being in London, and hope something positive happens. The Raiders opened the season with three straight losses, including a 16-9 setback against the New England Patriots last weekend. Their next chance for a win will come against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday at Wembley Stadium in the NFL's first of three regular-season games in the British capital. 'It's crazy,' said Raiders quarterback Derek Carr, a rookie who has started all three games of his professional career. 'I texted my wife this morning and she was still on Tuesday. I was texting her goodnight and she said good morning. It was weird. 'As the days have gone, it's gotten progressively better. The faster I can get into the right time zone, which is here, the better it will feel.' The Dolphins chose to delay their arrival until Friday, giving the Raiders more time to get acclimated to the time difference and get their sleep patterns in order. Miami are playing in London for the second time since the NFL started staging regular-season games in Britain, losing 13-10 to New York Giants back in 2007, while the Raiders are in England for the first time.

"Menelik Watson always harboured dreams of playing at Wembley Stadium when he was growing up in Manchester, but he never believed he would be appear there today as an NFL player. The League’s International Series returns to the capital as the Oakland Raiders ‘host’ the Miami Dolphins in the ninth fixture to be played in London since 2007, when Sunday’s ‘away’ side first ventured to the UK to play a regular-season game against the New York Giants. Seven years ago the idea of a career in American Football was completely alien to Watson, who grew up in impoverished conditions in Longsight wanting to play for his beloved Manchester City only to see those hopes — along with his aspirations of playing professional basketball — dashed.

"Paul Scholes believes Brendan Rodgers was too negative in his team selection for Liverpool's crucial Champions League tie against Basle. Liverpool were sent crashing out of the Champions League after failing to beat the Swiss side at Anfield and stumbling to a 1-1 draw. And Scholes said that the Liverpool manager Rodgers picked a negative team, leaving some attacking players on the bench. VIDEO Scroll down for Rodgers' reaction after Basle draw . Brendan Rodgers saw his Liverpool side crash out of the Champions League after a draw with Basle . Jordan Henderson (left) was selected along with Joe Allen, Lucas and Steven Gerrard (right) In his Independent column, Scholes said: 'Last season I felt he (Rodgers) had a confidence about him, and would pick attacking, positive teams. His selection on Tuesday was nothing like that. 'Liverpool needed to blast Basle out of the way. Instead Rodgers left Adam Lallana and Philippe Coutinho on the bench. 'It was a game he needed to win and yet he picked a midfield of Joe Allen, Jordan Henderson and Lucas Leiva – all solid players but more than two from those three and the side feels defensive. Raheem Sterling was Liverpool's only attacking threat as Phillippe Coutinho (centre) started on the bench . Basle secured the draw they needed to beat Liverpool to second place behind Real Madrid in Group B . 'At half-time he brought on a left-back, Alberto Moreno, and a winger, Lazar Markovic, who has done very little for him so far. 'Then when he did bring on Coutinho, a No 10 to his boots – he even wears the number – he played the Brazilian in central midfield.'","Liverpool went out of Champions League after failing to beat Swiss side .

"Thousands of British people with second homes in France are facing tax rises of 20 per cent as the country’s Socialist government targets wealthy foreigners. President Francois Hollande’s floundering administration wants to use the extra money to raise an extra £117m towards its EU budget deficit. Mr Hollande’s employment minister, Francois Rebsamen, said some 170,000 homes in Paris alone were owned by ‘rich foreigners’ who could afford to pay more tax. French President, Francois Hollande wants to use the new tax to fill a major hole in the nation's finances . But Mr Rebsamen questioned the fairness of the new charge, saying: ‘I am mostly against it. When we say that we won't increase taxes, we shouldn't increase taxes.’ Other opponents said it was another example of a desperate left-wing government which views property owners as ‘lambs to the slaughter’. The so-called ‘Weekend Tax’ would primarily be aimed at those who buy apartments in major cities and then leave them empty for most of the year. It will mean an extra 20 per cent on the ‘tax d’habitation’ (habitation tax), paid by anyone with property in France. The increase will apply to homes which are not primary residences and which have not been rented out in around 30 major urban areas – a status which applies to properties owned by thousands of rich British people. Paris is notorious for its empty apartment blocks, with flats only used occasionally at weekends and during holidays. The tax d’habitation on a two bedroom flat in central Paris is currently around £550 a year – a figure which will rise to £660. French Finance Minister Michel Sapin, pictured, pledged that no new taxes would be introduced in 2015 . It is hoped that the rise in charges will put more of the apartments on the rental market, and add to the coffers of local authorities. But Jean Perrin, president of the National Union of Property Owners, said the Socialists had reduced property owners to ‘lambs to the slaughter’. Mr Perrin said: ‘It’s a new craze of this government to tax property. It’s a mistake because it will increase the cost of real estate and punish owners who have worked hard to have a second home. Mr Perrin added: ‘Saying this is about freeing up housing is a fundamental error.’ Mr Hollande’s party came to power as an avowed enemy of the rich, proposing a top rate of income tax of 75 per cent, but it has since softened its approach. Finance Minister Michel Sapin said last month that no new taxes would be introduced in 2015 – a claim which has not been greeted with much confidence. There are some 200,000 UK holiday homeowners in France. Most are in Provence, the Dordogne, Normandy and Brittany, but flats in cities such as Paris, Bordeaux and Marseille are also extremely popular – both as an investment and as a weekend and holiday retreat. According to a report in the respected financial newspaper, Les Echos, the new property tax bill will be presented to Parliament in the coming months.","Francios Hollande needs the extra cash to boost his floundering economy .
He is considering a 20 per cent tax hike on all second homes in France .

"Before his four-year-old daughter Leah received cancer treatment, Devon Still gave her a moving pep talk. The Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle posted the 10-second clip on Instagram alongside the caption: ‘I might be nervous and scared beyond words but I’ll never let her see it...let’s get this done!’ After four rounds of chemotherapy, Still posted a picture of Leah following the successful removal of a tumour. Scroll down for video . Cincinnati Bengals players Emmanuel Lamur (59), Devon Still (75), and James Wright (86) wait to go onto the field at the start of an NFL game against the Atlanta Falcons . ‘After a 5hr 50min surgery the surgeon was able to remove ALL of her tumor and all of her lymph nodes and her right adrenal gland where it all started from...best news I’ve received in a long time #PrayForLeah #GodIsGood #ThanksForYourSupport,’ he said. After being diagnosed in June with neuroblastoma, a form of childhood cancer, the public support for Leah has been incredible. His jersey became the fastest-selling in history, with all proceeds going toward paediatric cancer research. Still was cut by the Bengals but put on the practice squad to support Leah in June. The move means that he will receive a weekly salary of $6,300, will have to travel less, and get to spend more time with Leah, who is being treated in Philadelphia. Devon Still of the Cincinnati Bengals looks on before the game against the Atlanta Falcons . Still explained: ‘They said if I keep working on my physical... and mentally prepared myself to focus on football then they can move me back up to the roster so I am not all the way out of the loop…’ ‘Just them sticking by me through this whole time, they understand exactly what I am going through. It is a blessing I am on this organization.’ Since Leah’s diagnosis, Still has shared images on Instagram showing her dancing in the hospital and grinning as she headed back for her fourth round of chemotherapy. The proud father, who is engaged, has also shaved his head in support of his daughter, who has lost her hair to her treatment.

"Vernon Kay looks ahead to Sunday’s showdown between the Miami Dolphins and the Oakland Raiders at Wembley. The game is the first of three NFL International Series contests being held in London this season. The International Series games are completely different from anything that NFL teams are used to. The Wembley atmosphere is something that surprises young players when they walk into the stadium. They think they are walking into an arena where the fans are inexperienced but, in fact, the Wembley fans are just as knowledgeable and more excited than American fans. The veterans who I have spoken to say it is not too dissimilar an atmosphere to the Super Bowl. As an event, the NFL at Wembley is phenomenal. I’m like a pig in muck because, after watching the Bears win the Super Bowl in 1985, I went to all the pre-season games that were called American Bowls. It didn’t really mean anything but we got to see Joe Montana and Dan Marino on the field for two minutes. After the London Monarchs and NFL Europe, we have now established Wembley as the home of American football in the UK. We have three games this season and I am hearing we will have five next year. After that, we can start to predict how many season tickets we will sell for an eight-game season. The Oakland Raiders landed in England on Monday and have been training at Pennyhill Park all week . The Raiders are searching for their first win of the season and fancy their their chances against the Dolphins . There is some talk that the NFL has set a date that there will be a team in London by 2022. I think that gives them enough time to survey, study, and try to judge how much interest there will be in the game. But I still think that it is too far away. Let’s try and take advantage of the momentum we have now. 3 – 40ft containers are shipped from the US for each Wembley game . 15 – the number of days it takes for the containers to travel from USA to England . 9,600 – bottles of Gatorade are used for each game, 400 cases . 8,000- weight in kilograms of gameday equipment used . 360 – the number of balls that are shipped to England for use . 5,787 – jerseys were sold during two International Series games last season . 3,831 – caps were also sold during two Wembley weekends in 2013 . There is no expense spared for the fan experience during Wembley week. To take over Regent Street on the Saturday before the game must cost a fortune -they spent £250,000 on banners alone last season. My first ever American Bowl was in 1986 or 1987 when I literally dragged my dad along to Wembley with my brother. But one thing I have noticed when I sit in the crowd for these International Series games is that it is dads dragging kids. There aren’t many kids at the Wembley games and we need to start encouraging them to come along. Both the Miami Dolphins and Oakland Raiders are struggling. It is a very similar situation to when we hosted the Minnesota Vikings against the Pittsburgh Steelers last season. Both teams weren’t doing very well and it turned out to be one of the best games we have had at Wembley. I am hoping that will be the same on Sunday. The Dolphins are one of the most supported teams in the UK so there will be plenty of their fans there. Ryan Tannehill has all the talent and will be looking to bounce back after a turbulent week with the Dolphins . Derek Carr is starting for the Raiders at Wembley with Matt Schaub remaining in the US for personal reasons . Miami vs Oakland, 6pm (Wembley) Carolina at Baltimore, 6pm . Green Bay at Chicago, 6pm . Buffalo at Houston, 6pm . Tennessee at Indianapolis, 6pm . Detroit at New York, 6pm . Tampa Bay at Pittsburgh, 6pm . Jacksonville at San Diego, 9.05pm . Atlanta at Minnesota, 9.25pm . Philadelphia at San Francisco, 9.25pm . New Orleans at Dallas, 1.30am . I think Miami’s issues lie with their offensive line. They are not strong at all and Mike Pouncey has injured his knee. He is a real loss for them. But they still have issues at quarterback, too. Ryan Tannehill has shown great promise but is still inconsistent. I played golf on Friday with Dick Anderson - a member of Miami’s 1972 undefeated team. He said that the problem the Dolphins have got is inconsistency and that they don’t have any real leaders to take them forward. For the Raiders, I don’t think Derek Carr at quarterback is a solution. But they have got that thing the Raiders have always lived and breathed on is that they bring in experienced and veteran players. I met Charles Woodson on Wednesday and he is really charismatic. He was saying it is really different for them to come over here and play football on foreign soil. The set up is different and it is a different experience for the guys, but they are trying to embrace it as, in Woodson’s words, “an opportunity to get that first W”. The Dolphins flew in on Friday and they will not have acclimatised as well as the Raiders. They practiced in 90-degree heat in Miami earlier in the week, but they are coming to Wembley where it will be overcast. I think the Raiders will win. I have got a feeling that everything that has gone wrong for them so far this season will come right on Sunday. Meeting Menelik . Menelik Watson and Vernon Kay chew the fat . I met Menelik Watson for the first time on Wednesday and he said he has got 30 or 40 family tickets for the game because a lot of them have never seen him play. Physically, he is massive. I put some pictures of us on Instagram, and he is an absolute monster. He enjoys American football because of the physical aspect of it. I watched him at practice as I wanted to see how he was getting on. He really stood up for himself. I was really surprised how good he was because, considering he hasn’t played a lot of football, technically he is quite good. He is quick and has fast hands, which is what you need as an offensive lineman and he just needs to learn the game. He is really proud to be representing Great Britain and is doing massive things. The process of player selection is quite elitist because if you don’t get into college then it is hard to get into the league. But there has to be a way for international players with the physical abilities and the right attributes to be American football players to get onto teams. Watson embraces Vince Wilfork after the Raiders sank to a narrow 16-9 defeat to the Patriots last week . Quarterback showdown . In the Sunday night game on Channel 4 between the New Orleans Saints and Dallas Cowboys, we have got two great quarterbacks with very different public opinions. Drew Brees has won a Super Bowl with the Saints and is a record breaker. It seems that whenever we see Brees play, he is always breaking records. It just shows what a good quarterback he is. The incomparable Drew Brees leaves the field after leading the New Orleans Saints to victory over the Vikings . Tony Romo's season has been plagued by turnovers as the inconsistent Cowboys bid to improve their fortunes . On the flip side, we have Tony Romo for the Cowboys. I was never a big Romo fan but this season I have started to feel a bit sorry for him. If you watch him, you can tell how frustrated he gets. Romo has got a brand new offensive line and it’s taking them some time to bed in. When I saw them against the 49ers they were very good against one of the strongest defenses in the league. But with Romo, it’s not his highlights that are under the magnifying glass, it is his mistakes and interceptions that everyone picks up on. Channel 4 will broadcast live coverage of the Miami Dolphins against the Oakland Raiders from Wembley Stadium on Sunday night as well as the New Orleans Saints against the Dallas Cowboys. Vernon Kay presents NFL: The American Football Show, Mondays at 11pm on Channel 4.","Miami Dolphins take on Oakland Raiders at Wembley Stadium on Sunday .

"Questions: Jessica Chambers, 19, was found with burns on 98 per cent of her body on Saturday night . Police have made a desperate plea to the public for information after a teenager was found burned alive in a rural road in Mississippi in what they called a 'horrendous' case. Authorities have not made any arrests in the murder of 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, who was barely alive when first responders found her in Courtland on Saturday night. She died in hospital later that evening, with burns to 98 per cent of her body. At a press conference on Thursday, District Attorney John Champion said they have spoken to 'many, many' people  but still feel like there is still a lot they do not know. 'There's just not a lot of street talk out there about who may or may not have done it,' he said. 'We feel like somebody out there has heard something.' Speaking with Assistant District Attorney Jay Hale, they said there were some rumors circulating that were not true, including that Chambers was still on fire when she was found. But it has emerged that the killer apparently got into the car before setting it alight. The teenager also had a large gash on her head. To piece together the last few hours of her life, investigators continue to pore over surveillance footage from a gas station where she was seen 90 minutes before her death. They are also looking at her cell phone, which was left behind at the scene. 'We're leaving no stone unturned at this point,' Champion added. 'This is an absolute horrendous case... This situation is about as bad as it comes.' Last moments: Jessica Chambers, 19, was caught on surveillance footage just 90 minutes before she was burned alive along the side of a rural road on Saturday. She is seen walking towards the store . Caught on camera: Jessica (seen left) then went into the shop and paid while three men chatted nearby . Scene: The gas station and convenience store Jessica visited before she was found severely burned along the side of a nearby road. The cashier claims Jessica told him she was 'going somewhere' The gas station surveillance footage shows her climbing out of her car, walking across the forecourt and stopping to wave at a friend, before walking off camera. She then returns to the store to pay. Convenience store manager Ali Fadhel, who served the teenager, told the Associated Press that Chambers came in frequently and he would often speak with her. According to Fadhel, Chambers was wearing a dark-colored sweater and pajama pants that looked like sweatpants. Chambers said she was going to make a stop before going home, Fadhel said. 'If she knew she had a problem with somebody, she would have told me,' Fadhel said. Chambers bought $14 worth of gas, more than the $5 or so she usually purchased, he said. 'I asked her, ""Why are you putting so much gas?"" She said, ""I'm going somewhere"",' Fadhel said. Authorities have not commented on the claims. On her way out, Chambers got a call on her cellphone, Fadhel said. When she left, she headed south on Highway 51, he said. Questions: While she was inside, a man (seen top right) filled up a gas can close to her car (the dark vehicle in the center) but he has been cleared. After going inside the shop, she drove off . Terrifying: She had told her mother she was going out to get food when she and her car were set alight . Crime scene: Yellow crime scene tape marks the location where the 19-year-old  was found severely burned. Authorities are working to piece together the last hours of her life in efforts to catch who set her on fire . Grisly discovery: The teenager was barely conscious when first responders arrived to her car, which was on this bank, and she managed to whisper something - but authorities have not revealed what she said . About 90 minutes later, a motorist called 911 to report a burning car a mile away and first responders arrived to find the burned young woman. She was not covered in flames, as previously reported, authorities said at the press conference. She whispered something to one of the fire officers. Investigators have not revealed what she said but indicated that the final words may help find her killer, WMC reported. 'She was able to communicate. It was difficult,' said Jay Hale, an assistant district attorney who prosecutes cases in Panola County. Peter Odom, an attorney who has prosecuted some arson cases, told HLN's 'Nancy Grace' that investigators will be assessing the physical appearance of suspects. 'They're looking for someone with singed eyebrows and maybe burned hands. Because the burner often gets burned,' he said. Plea: District Attorney John Champion pleaded for information as he spoke at a press conference on Thursday . Tragic: Two years before Jessica's death, her older brother Ben (right) was killed in a car crash . Authorities said initial autopsy results reveal the girl died from severe burns that covered 98 per cent of her body. 'I mean it's bad,' DA John Champion told Fox. 'I have been doing this for 21 years and as far as the means of death it is certainly the worst I have dealt with.' Authorities are also looking into reports that she went to a party before her death, but they have said her appearance - pajama trousers and her hair in a bun - suggests she did not attend the party. Friends said that the family can't think of anyone that might have wanted to hurt Jessica, who didn't have a boyfriend and was not known to have been seeing anyone. They added that she had just started a new job at Goody's Department Store, which she loved. Lisa Chambers, the girl's mother, begged with anyone to come forward with any information they may have about the heinous crime. Heartbroken: Her mother, Lisa Chambers, sobbed as she pleaded with the public for information . Ripped apart: Her father Ben, pictured right, has also appealed for any information in her death . 'They have ripped everything I have,' she told Fox. 'She left to go clean out her car and was going to get [herself] something to eat.' Amanda Prince, who identified herself as Jessica Chambers' older sister, told CNN Wednesday night that the family is 'shocked, lost ... confused, angry, hurt.' Asked if she knew of anyone who had a grudge against her sister or might want to hurt her, Prince replied, 'No one. She was loved by everybody. I don't know who would want to do this or why.' Mississippi authorities say they have received offers to help from several agencies, including the U.S. attorney's office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. A candle-lit vigil will be held for Jessica on Saturday. Anyone with information on the murder should contact the Sheriff's Office at 662-563-6230.

"The inquest of murdered Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko could examine the possible role of British spies in his death. Both MI6 and the Russian secret service, the FSB, could become interested parties in the inquest into Mr Litvinenko’s death, set to be held next year. At a pre-inquest review at Camden Town Hall today, it was also revealed that certain government departments have not yet handed over material relevant to the inquest which was asked for in January. New questions: Former Russian security agent Alexander Litvinenko in his hospital bed, at the University College Hospital in central London. The inquest into his death will examine the role of MI6 and the Russian secret service, the FSB, it is claimed . Mr Litvinenko, 43, died in November 2006 after he was poisoned with polonium-210 while drinking tea at a meeting, allegedly with two Russians - former KGB contacts Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun - at the Millennium Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square. A further pre-inquest review will be held in December to decide on the full scope of the inquest. Hugh Davies, counsel to the inquest, today said it could extend to include 'the possible culpability of the Russian state', as well as 'the possible culpability of the British state in the death of Alexander Litvinenko either: one, in carrying out by itself or its agents the poisoning; or two, failing to take reasonable steps to protect Mr Litvinenko from a real and immediate risk to his life'. Mr Davies said the Russian state has been invited since January to become an 'interested party' in the inquest, but it has not yet taken up the offer. Mr Davies said there were a 'number of competing and increasingly controversial theories' surrounding Mr Litvinenko’s death. He said the inquest’s scope could also include involvement of other parties, including friend Boris Berezovsky, Chechen-related groups and the Spanish mafia. Marina Litvinenko, the widow of former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko, arrives for a pre-inquest review at Camden Town Hall in London . The Millennium Mayfair Hotel in central London where Litvinenko met a contact on the day he fell ill . It had been speculated that Mr Perepilichnyy was poisoned in a similar manner to former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko who died after being contaminated with Polonium 210 in 2006 . The coffin of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko is carried during his funeral at Highgate Cemetery in London December 7, 2006 . 'It appears to be common ground that these issues require determination in December,' he told the hearing. 'Should the possibility that Alexander Litvinenko died as a result of an accident be included in the scope of the inquest and should the possibility that Alexander Litvinenko committed suicide be included within the scope of the inquest?', he added. Maya Sikand, for Mr Litvinenko’s widow Marina, said if the Russian state could not become an interested party, then it was possible the FSB could. 'It may be that what should also be considered is whether MI6 should be invited to either apply or be so designated,' she added. She said while the suggestions Mr Litvinenko may have committed suicide or died in an accident were 'distasteful' to his widow, and there was 'not a shred of evidence' to support them, Mrs Litvinenko was prepared to see the theories examined in the inquest. Mr Davies also told the court that certain government departments and agencies, asked to supply relevant information in January, had still not handed it over. 'It has become apparent that a number of departments or agencies that do hold or may hold material have not yet complied with the request of making the material available for inspection,' he said. Neil Garnham QC, representing the Home Office, said departments asked for information were the Atomic Weapons Establishment, the Cabinet Office, Home Office, Foreign Office, Health Protection Agency, the Ministry of Defence, intelligence and security agencies, and the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Each had started searching for relevant material, and expect to hand it over within weeks, he said. Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Litvinenko said she hoped to end speculation surrounding her husband’s death. She said: 'I believe it is important, not just for me and my family and my friends, it’s important for the two countries. 'It’s important for Russia and England because this relationship is quite difficult and I think everybody needs to know what happened to Sacha (Mr Litvinenko). 'I would just like to know the truth because I want to stop all speculation. 'The most difficult thing to me was of course listening about an accident and suicide, and I want to stop it.'","MI6 and Russian secret service, the FSB, could become interested parties in the inquest .

"When 5-year-old Zoey was first adopted this summer, she slept with slices of pizza and horded scraps of food from the trash can, still traumatized by the years of starvation at the hands of her biological parents. Two years ago, Zoey and her two siblings were taken away from biological parents Kenny and Kathleen Sanchez, when a Colorado police officer noticed the then 3-year-old's skeletal frame - severely underweight at just 19 pounds. Zoey is now healthy and no longer afraid her food will be taken away from her, seven months after moving in with adoptive parents Amy and Victor Arellano, 9News reports . The little girl's recovery now has an even better ending, as her heartwarming story broadcast around the nation on Wednesday led to the arrest of her biological parents, who have been on the run for the last year and a half. Happy ending: Five-year-old Zoey (right) was taken from her biological parents two years ago after a Colorado police officer saw her father strike her in the face, and noticed she was underweight. She has since been adopted by Amy (left) and Victor Arellano . Hungry: When she was taken away from her parents in February 2012, Zoey weighed just 19 pounds. The Arellanos say Zoey would bring slices of pizza to bed and horde food when she first started living with them . Biological parents: After the story of Zoey's happy recovery and adoption was broadcast around the nation on Wednesday, her fugitive biological parents Kenny (left) and Kathleen Sanchez (right) were arrested more than 1,400 miles away in Foley, Alabama. The two skipped $50,000 bail in July 2013 . The Sanchezes were first arrested in February 2012, when an off-duty Boulder, Colorado police officer witnessed Zoey's father hit her in the face in a store when she was hysterically crying out of hunger. The concerned officer said in a police report that Zoey had 'sagging skin, protruding bones and visible ribs'. He reported the incident to local police and continued to follow the family, including Zoey's then 4-year-old brother and 2-month-old sister Madison, until the parents were arrested. Kenny Sanchez told responding officers that his daughter was 'crying uncontrollably because she was hungry' and refused to stop even though he promised to get food 'as soon as they were done shopping'. He says he only hit her in the upper left leg 'to get her to stop crying', but responding officers noticed 'numerous bruises and scratches' on the girl they described as 'malnourished'. Zoey was taken to the hospital for evaluation where doctors also found multiple bruises and healing scratches on her body and face. New life: Amy and Victor Arellano adopted Zoey and her now 2-year-old sister Madison last May. Their older brother was adopted by extended family members . Family: Amy Arellano (right) is related to Zoey's biological father, and she and her husband have three grown children, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren . 'They also noted that the victim was extremely malnourished to the point that it was likely to affect her organs,' according to the affidavit. The parents explained Zoey's weight by saying she had an eating disorder, and had seen doctors in Florida for the issue. While there is evidence Zoey did see out-of-state doctors, it was revealed that her parents did not bring her for follow-up visits. The hospital report led police to charge her parents with child abuse, but the two went on the run in July 2013 after posting $50,000 bail each and failing to show up to pre-trial court dates. Zoey and her sister Madison, now two, were adopted by the Arellanos  at a Denver Adoption Day event in May, while they brother was adopted by extended family members. Amy Arellano is related to Zoey's biological father, and the couple have three grown children, many grandchildren and several great grandchildren. Normal little girl: Among some of Zoey's favorite things are the movie Frozen and chocolate. She hopes to get a baby doll with a stroller for her birthday later this month . The little girl is now so comfortable with the Arellanos that she calls them mom and dad, but her transition to her new family was not so easy. Mrs Arellano says that Zoey was quiet for the first few months, usually not saying anything much more than 'I'm hungry'. 'She would hover around the trash can when we got her,' she told 9News. 'Finally, she learned it wasn't going to go nowhere. I wasn't going to take it from her.' On Wednesday, the Colorado station broadcast a story about Zoey's new life with the Arellanos, showing the now-healthy little girl talking about her love of the movie Frozen, chocolate and the presents she wants for her birthday this month. That story was also broadcast in Mobile, Alabama and within hours Zoey's fugitive parents were arrested at an apartment complex in the town of Foley.","Zoey was just 19 pounds when the then 3-year-old was taken away from her biological parents in Colorado two years ago .

Man-of-the-Match: Grant Leadbitter . Those bare statistics, though, do not do justice to how this contest ebbed and flowed and the stories it produced, from 17-year-old Jordan Rossiter marking his Liverpool debut with a goal from 35 yards to Middlesbrough’s Patrick Bamford, holding his nerve in added time of extra time. All 22 players on the pitch at the final whistle took a kick in the shootout (goalkeepers included), with some stepping up twice. Heartbreakingly for Middlesbrough, who ran themselves to a stanstill, Albert Adomah became the fall guy, firing wide into The Kop after Suso gave Liverpool match point. 'It was a real good night for us,’ said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. ‘I was pleased to get through in that experience. It was great for our young players. It’s good to win, no matter how you win. They were real good quality penalties and I’m pleased to get into the next round.’ He will also be relieved. While supporters will have gone home struggling to comprehend the events that had unfolded in front of them, Rodgers will have left Anfield wondering when his side are going to stop giving away cheap goals. A better team than Middlesbrough might have eviscerated Liverpool here and, really, Aitor Karanka’s team had sufficient chances to make the eight-time winners of this competition pay the ultimate price: Adam Clayton almost knocked them out in the 85th minute when he hit the post. By that time, Middlesbrough – who arrived here buoyant on the back of a three-game winning spree – had pegged Liverpool back, Adam Reach bulleting in a header from a wonderful free-kick by Grant Leadbitter in the 62nd minute after Mamadou Sakho had handled. ‘I never thought the tie was going away from us,’ Rodgers argued. ‘But we are making too many mistakes at the moment. The first goal we are disappointed with and even more so the second goal. We gave the ball away sloppy, when we were in total control of the game was in control. ‘We made it hard for ourselves. But we showed resilience and it is job done. I don’t need to jump up and down to celebrate. We have not had a great start to the season but this is a great night for us and (winning) is another step forward.’ Rickie Lambert's (R) early effort is blocked before rebounding to Rossiter to score after only 10 minutes of the third round match .

Middlesbrough made the brighter start but in the ninth minute came the moment that will live with Rossiter for life. When Lucas lofted a ball forward, Rickie Lambert – captain for the night on what was his first Liverpool start – saw shot was blocked by the advancing Jamal Blackman. But the danger had not been cleared and Rossiter, showing remarkable poise for one so young, firmly and accurately returned his drive from 35 yards, the ball skidding past Blackman, who made a ungainly attempt to salvage the situation on what was also his debut, into the unguarded net. For a moment, Rossiter – standing out from the crowd by wearing a simple pair of black boots – could not quite believe what had happened but then he took off, jumping with delight and racing over to celebrate by Rodgers, who was clapping his hands together in joyous approval. There has long been talk that Rossiter has the potential to become a fixture in Liverpool’s first team in the future – Robbie Fowler felt compelled to compare him on Twitter to Steven Gerrard in January 2013 – and, perhaps, in years to come this clip will be shown over and over again.

One thing for certain is that highlights of this contest will receive plenty of airings. Middlesbrough deserved their shot at extra-time but Liverpool found a rhythm that had been missing before and looked to have finally seen of their opponents in the 109th minute when Suso fired in. Much to Rodgers bewilderment, however, there was to be another twist when Raheem Sterling gave the ball away to Daniel Ayala, who sent Bamford clear. He was crudely brought down by Kolo Toure and kept his nerve to set up the shootout. ‘I have no words to say properly how I feel,’ said Karanka. ‘I have to say that my players, the crowd, everything was brilliant. The only thing that wasn’t was the last penalty.’ Karanka could leave with his head held high. His team, after all, did all they could and more to cause the shock of the round.

"Cristiano Ronaldo scored hat-trick number 25 of his Real Madrid career as Carlo Ancelotti’s side made it 18 goals in three games with a thumping win over Elche. It was Ronaldo’s eighth goal inside a week and after the game he was asked if he was still happy at Madrid. He said: ‘Things are going well for more on a personal level the team is scoring goals, winning matches and playing well.’ Asked about Jose Mourinho’s recent comments about the pair no longer having a relationship, he added: ‘It’s not for me to talk about things like that I’m just concentrating on what we are doing on the pitch.’ Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale celebrate after the Portuguese scored his second in the 5-1 victory .

There was crisis talk a week ago at Madrid but five goals against Basle in the Champions League, eight against Deportivo, and five against Elche here have silenced all the gloom. They will face far tougher opposition in the coming weeks but now, fully in their stride, they will fear no one. Ronaldo even grabbed a late fourth goal from a Gareth Bale pass and that blossoming partnership is another reason for Real Madrid supporters to be full of optimism. The highlight of the first half was a strange refereeing performance from Carlos Clos Gomez. On 15 minutes he pointed to the spot when Ronaldo looked to clear from inside the area and caught Pedro Mosquera unintentionally. Ronaldo later admitted that it had been a penalty but both Real Madrid and Elche players looked bemused. Within minutes Gomez had made another very strange decision this time in Madrid’s favour. Gary Mendes Rodrigues went down under a challenge from Marcelo. It was debatable whether the challenge had been a foul but the contact from Marcelo that brought the Elche forward crashing to ground was inside the area. Clos gave a free-kick on the edge of the area that Elche wasted. Albácar Gallego points to the sky after giving Elche a surprise lead from the penalty spot . Bale equalised only four minutes later with a towering header from James Rodriguez's cross . The former Tottenham Hotspur winger issues his trademark 'heart-shaped hands' goal celebration . New signing Keylor Navas (above) makes an acrobatic save while Iker Casillas watched from the bench . VIDEO Ancelotti vindicated as Ronaldo scores four . Before the next bizarre penalty incident Real Madrid were level with Bale heading in James Rodriguez’ cross. It was his fifth goal in five games - aided by Manu Herrera’s very flat dive. Then came penalty number two with Gomez pointing to the spot after minimal contact from Mosquera on Marcelo – again players from both sides looked bemused but Ronaldo’s penalty was unstoppable into the top right-hand corner. Real Madrid extended their lead when Ronaldo scored with another thundering header this time from a Bale cross. The home side were now in complete control and debutant keeper Keylor Navas was having less and less to do. In for the rested Iker Casillas who is expected to brought back into the side for the weekend’s difficult trip to Villarreal, it was Navas first competitive match since the World Cup. Casillas was still the centre of attention with cameras focused on the bench as he munched on an apple during the second half. He appears to be a dead man walking in Madrid’s battle of the goalkeepers with Navas unlikely to still be the number two next season. For now however the greatest keeper in Spain’s history retains seniority and this start for Navas was seen as a reward for his patience.

Madrid toiled for the fourth goal and Ronaldo came close with a shot drilled towards Herrera’s near post scrambled away by the keeper who then fumbled the resulting corner kick. Javier Hernandez came on with ten minutes left replacing James. The former Manchester United former had staked his claim for a place in the starting line-up with two goals against Deportivo last weekend but as if to show how difficult it will be for him to get into Carlo Ancelotti’s starting line-up, he was on the bench again despite the debut goals. Hernandez’s appearance did bring a goal but it came from another former United player with Ronaldo wining another slightly dubious penalty and thrashing it home for goal number four and hat-trick number 25. He and Bale had not finished and there was a late fourth for Ronaldo – his eighth goal inside a week.

"A high-profile UKIP politician is facing a racism storm after being caught on camera saying all immigrants to Britain should be sent back home. Victoria Ayling, who made headlines when she defected from the Tories in March, made the inflammatory comments in a 20-minute video seen by The Mail on Sunday. On the subject of immigration she talks about restricting the numbers of foreigners entering the UK, but then adds: ‘I just want to send the lot back, but I can’t say that.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . UKIP star: Victoria Ayling is facing a racism storm after being caught on camera saying all immigrants in Britain should be sent back home . Defected: Ayling left the Tory party and joined UKIP in March and is a key ally of party leader Nigel Farage . She then goes on to joke that her controversial remark could one day come back to haunt her. She said: ‘[It could be used for] some future get back at me. Bribery, blackmail – we need the blackmail music don’t we.’ Last night one MP said he was ‘disgusted’ by the comments that had ‘no place in front line politics’. Mrs Ayling, 54, became a high-profile recruit to UKIP when she confronted David Cameron during this year’s Tory conference and told him she was leaving the party. She has been called a ‘trusted ally’ of UKIP leader Nigel Farage, so her comments will come as a blow to the party following a year of controversies. Earlier this year, MEP Godfrey Bloom provoked anger after referring to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’ in a speech about foreign aid. He later resigned from the party after he called some female activists ‘sluts’. Mr Farage last night said that Mrs  Ayling’s comments were ‘slightly odd’. He added: ‘I have met her two or three times and I have discussed policy at length before accepting her into the party. ‘I had no reason to believe she held views that were extreme or inconsistent with ours. While this comment looks odd and unpleasant there may be a context here that is slightly different to the way it appears.’ Defiant: Video filmed by Mrs Ayling's ex-husband Rob in 2008 and last night she said she stood by her comments . Controversial: The 20-minute video was shot to promote her political career . UKIP want to end ‘mass, uncontrolled immigration’ but does not call for repatriation of legal immigrants. The video was shot in 2008 – but Mrs Ayling last night said she stood by the comments. Mrs Ayling’s husband, Rob, from whom she has since divorced, helped shoot the footage to promote her political career. In one take, she said: ‘We must basically repatriate those that shouldn’t be here. That’s not quite policy yet. Maybe I should soften it a bit.’ She then added: ‘OK. Send them back.’ Rob is then heard to mutter: ‘National Front.’ In the very next take, Mrs Ayling – a Lincolnshire County councillor and deputy leader of the local UKIP party – says : ‘Multiculturalism is dead, I’m allowed to say that, but maybe Britishness is waving the National Front flag a bit. ‘We must control immigration. We cannot sustain the numbers coming in; the strains on our infrastructure are enormous. Control should be done fairly and the points system like they have in Australia and all those coming here should be encouraged to speak English so they can integrate.’ She adds: ‘I just want to send the lot back but I can’t say that.’ Last night, Mrs Ayling insisted her comments were taken ‘out of context’ and she was only referring to illegal immigrants. 'Multiculturalism is dead': Mrs Ayling references the National Front during the video . 'Complete opportunism': Mr Ayling said the video was in the public interest as she tries to become an MP or MEP . She said: ‘It is nothing different from what the Home Secretary is advocating now any way. And the blackmail music is from a Monty Python sketch. I don’t think there is anything there that can be seen as offensive or politically incorrect.’ ‘I stand by what I said: illegal immigrants should be sent back home and multiculturalism won’t work. It was a throwaway comment that has been taken out of context.’ Speaking about the footage, Mr Ayling said: ‘Victoria said during the divorce she would never be entering national politics again. Now, with her being a rising star of UKIP,  I think it is a public interest story in terms of the electorate knowing what kind of a woman she is.’ ‘I remember remarking that [her comment] was a little bit National Front and she replied that we should send them back. I wasn’t shocked as she’s like that all the time.’ ‘Victoria will do anything to further her political career. She felt she was passed over by the Tories, that’s why she defected. She has a better chance of being an MP or MEP with UKIP. It is complete opportunism, power at all costs.’ Mrs Ayling was within 714 votes of becoming Tory MP for Grimsby at the 2010 Election, and since joining UKIP has enjoyed a high profile. 'Trusted ally': UKIP insiders said Mrs Ayling was 'fast-tracked' for a council seat . One insider said she was a ‘trusted ally’ of Mr Farage: ‘She was fast-tracked for a council seat and then went on the BBC politics show. ‘She was a “Farage filly”. She was on stage at main conference and was even invited down to London for a photoshoot by Nigel.’ The footage was shot when Mrs Ayling . was seeking selection as a Tory candidate for EU elections and features . soundbites on several issues. In between takes she is asked about defence: ‘Do we want the French to order our troops?’. She . replies: ‘Sod that. Just think of Waterloo, bastards.’ When immigration . is discussed Mr Ayling is heard saying: ‘And your favourite subject, . immigration...’ The couple . divorced acrimoniously last year and Mrs Ayling now lives with Kevin . Couling, who calls himself a ‘Lord’ after buying a title. The couple . gave an interview to German newspaper Der Spiegel in June this year in . which Mrs Ayling said Mr Cameron should ‘declare a state of emergency . and close the borders’ to curb immigration. Last . night, local MP Stephen Phillips, said: ‘Immigration is a huge issue. But anyone who says they “just want to send the lot back” has no place . at all in frontline politics. ‘People who have come here to work hard, to live by British values and to contribute to our communities have always been welcomed.  [Many] will be as disgusted as I am by the views which Mrs Ayling apparently holds.’ Iraqi-born Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi called on Miss Ayling to ‘retract her deeply damaging comments’, adding: ‘Hard-working immigrants contribute significantly to the UK.’ And Labour’s Diane Abbot said she was ‘shocked’ A UKIP spokesman last night said the party stood by the councillor and that the media ‘hampered debate on immigration’ by ‘failing to make the distinction between a frank discussion and unpalatable views’. ‘Given that this was before the time Victoria joined UKIP we cannot comment on why this video was made for the Conservatives. ‘However, we can vouch for her as a capable and decent councillor and support her through this time.’ Mr Farage said he did ‘recruit’ Mrs Ayling but was not involved in her selection as a local candidate. Holding court: Nigel Farage shares a joke with Victoria Ayling (left) and other UKIP members . Victoria Ayling hit the headlines earlier this year after ambushing David Cameron to tell him that she was leaving  the Tories. Shortly after the Prime Minister had finished his Conservative conference speech on March 16, Mrs Ayling cornered him to say she was defecting to UKIP because the Tories were ‘no longer the party of aspiration’. She claimed Mr Cameron ‘lost his temper’ and then ‘twisted’ her hand in anger – a claim that has been categorically denied by Downing Street. UKIP leader Nigel Farage hailed Mrs Ayling’s defection as ‘fantastic’ and described her as a ‘talented and experienced person who will work hard across Lincolnshire, the East Midlands and, indeed, the county’. She was then parachuted into Lincolnshire to fight for a county council seat. Wedding: Mrs Ayling's ex-husband Rob Ayling with his new wife Kristian . Mrs Ayling was left feeling ‘emotionally betrayed’ after her ex husband left her for a former beauty queen. The UKIP councillor and Rob Ayling split acrimoniously last year after he had an affair with Kristian Darling. She was a finalist in the Miss America competition in 1987, aged 17. A decree absolute was issued in August last year. Criticising Mrs Ayling for asking for too much from the settlement, a judge said at the time: ‘The wife has been unrealistic in this litigation. 'She has no doubt felt emotionally betrayed but she has taken this beyond the bounds of common sense.’ Mr Ayling married Miss Darling on Easter Day this year. The couple divide their time between the US and UK. Mrs Ayling  lives with Lord Kevin Couling, who is believed to have bought his title, the 64th Lord of Little Neasden.","Victoria Ayling says all immigrants in Britain should be sent back home .

"Visiting Santa Claus in his grotto either at a shopping mall or department store is an annual holiday tradition. Children and their families stand alongside Father Christmas for a photo after telling him what gifts they are hoping to see under the tree. But those looking to get their festivities off to more of a bang this year can head to a Georgia gun range - where patrons can pose alongside Kris Kringle while holding a firearm of their choice. Wish for weapons: Sandy Springs Gun Club in Georgia is inviting families along to hold a firearm of their choice during a photo shoot with Santa Claus . Sandy Springs Gun Club and Range has invited families to have their photo taken with Santa on Sunday. Those in the frame will stand next to the festive figure and will be able to choose from a number of weapons - a pistol, an AK-47 and an FN-SCAR (an assault rifle used by the U.S. Special Forces). Co-owner Robyn Workman Marzullo told WSBTV that safety is their first priority. 'We’re not trying to treat guns like toys. It’s not trying to send a message. It’s just about having a good time, getting into the holiday spirit and giving back to the community. 'Our customers and the people who support us will love to do something different for the holidays.' Only those over 18 will be allowed to hold the guns - which will be unarmed - in the photos. Children under the age of 12 will not be allowed into the range itself. In 2011, a gun club in Scottsdale, Arizona, did a similar thing. Toting the gun, and perhaps belts of ammunition around their necks, children smiled alongside a rather bewildered-looking Santa. A baby is also seen in one image grasping the end of an assault rifle alongside grinning parents.

Bradford midfielder Gary Liddle is relishing being underdogs against MK Dons and believes they can beat them for a second time this season. Bradford won 2-1 in a League One encounter a week ago and Liddle said: ‘It’s a case of can we repeat it? That’s the challenge. We know they are a good team and bounced back from the defeat against us by putting six past Crewe. 'It’s another big test for us and we’ll go into the game as underdogs again — exactly the same as last Tuesday — and we’ll relish it.’ MK Dons shocked in their 4-0 pummeling of Manchester United in the second round of the Capital One Cup . Louis van Gaal's Manchester United were beaten 4-0 by MK Dons in the Capital One Cup earlier this season . Shrewsbury vs Norwich .

"Arsenal broke a two year old record in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday by completing 741 passes in their 3-0 victory at Aston Villa. On Tuesday night at the Emirates it was the turn of Arsene Wenger’s men to be passed off the park. Beaten at their own game by Southampton, how about that? What a lesson this was. Nathaniel Clyne lets fly from 25 yards with a swerving strike that put Southampton into the lead, although goalkeeper David Ospina should have done better . Abou Diaby made his first start for Arsenal in a competitive game since March 2013 as the injury-prone midfielder was given a chance in the Capital One Cup tie . Arsenal: Ospina 4; Bellerin 5 (Akpom 86), Chambers 6.5, Hayden 5, Coquelin 5; Rosicky 5, Diaby 5.5 (Cazorla 67); Campbell 5.5 (Oxlade-Chamberlain 71), Wilshere 5, Podolski 4; Sanchez 6. Subs: Gibbs, Mertesacker, Martinez, Ajayi. Booked: Rosicky, Wilshere . Manager - Arsene Wenger: 5 . Southampton: Forster 6; Clyne 8, Fonte 7, Gardos 7.5, Targett 7 (Bertrand 85); Wanyama 6.5, Schneiderlin 9; Mane 7.5 (Long 72), Davis 7, Tadic 7.5; Pelle 7. Subs: Davis, Cork, Mayuka, Reed, McCarthy. Booked: Wanyama, Pelle, Tagett, Forster . Manager - Ronaldo Koeman: 8. Referee: Keith Stroud. Southampton dished it out, deserving winners after a towering performance from Morgan Schneiderlin in the centre of their midfield. Goodness knows how Saints clung on to him in the summer when Tottenham were trying to take him to White Hart Lane, but they did. He, like many others in Ronald Koeman’s team, played like a man possessed. Meet a Southampton supporter in the street today and they will stop you in your tracks to tell you about the moment time stood still when Nathaniel Clyne took a touch 30 yards out. It came in the 39th minute, when the score was one-apiece and Arsenal’s defence failed to chase down the Southampton defender when they cleared a corner. Clyne took a touch and unleashed a thunderbolt, smashing it beyond David Ospina, making his debut in Arsenal’s goal, to put Southampton ahead. It has gone down in Southampton folklore. Goodness knows how Clyne is consistently overlooked by England manager Roy Hodgson, but this rocket can only add to the Ready Brek glow around the Southampton right-back. Koeman’s team exposed Arsenal, playing on their fragile confidence and scarring them with with this thrilling victory. Even when they fell behind to Alexis Sanchez’s stunning free-kick in the 14th minute, Southampton didn’t panic. What a quality to have. Sanchez, pulling his shorts up so tight they looked like a pair of budgie smugglers before he took the free-kick, pinged it off his right book and into the top corner. Forster didn’t move. Arsenal fielded a young defence, Isaac Hayden one of three 19-year-olds in the back four, alongside Calum Chambers, Hector Bellerin and 23-year-old Francis Coquelin . Morgan Schneiderlin stops Costa Rica's World Cup star Joel Campbel in his tracks as Arsenal started brightly in an Emirates Stadium that wasn't quite full . Alexis Sanchez strikes a beauty of a free-kick over the Southampton wall and beyond the reach of goalkeeper Fraser Forster to put Arsenal ahead . The Chilean star celebrates scoring his fourth goal since arriving at Arsenal from Barcelona in the summer after his sumptuous free-kick had opened the scoring . Sanchez is fast becoming a firm favourite among the Arsenal fans, and has scored in his last three games at the Emirates Stadium . ‘1-0 to the Arsenal’ sang a hesitant Emirates crowd, almost full to the rafters after selling tickets to their young supporters for a tenner a pop. The lead didn’t last long. Tomas Rosicky, captaining Arsenal in the absence of Mikel Arteta, gave away a penalty when he clipped the legs of Southampton debutant Sadio Mane. Penalty, no question. Dusan Tadic scored, his first in a Southampton shirt, with a spot kick drilled straight down the centre of Ospina’s goal. The Arsenal keeper moved way too early. With Schneiderlin bossing it in the centre of the park, Arsenal’s midfield was muffled. Rosicky, Jack Wilshere and Abou Diaby, returning from a long spell out through injury, were miles off the pace. Miles off. It is difficult to even try to explain what Lukas Podolski was doing out on the left for Arsenal, other than to say he was disinterested. He shouldn’t play for this club, not if he is going to disrespect the red shirt like this. There is also no place in the game for Sanchez, possibly the only player who looked capable of doing something to bring Arsenal back into the tie, waving an imaginary yellow card at the referee. Tomas Rosicky captained Arsenal on his first start of the season but gave away a penalty when he made a silly tackle on Southampton debutant Sadio Mane . Dusan Tadic converted from the spot to put Southampton level, going down the middle of the goal to beat Arsenal's new goalkeeper David Ospina . Tadic acknowledges the travelling Southampton fans after his well-taken spot-kick had cancelled out Alexis Sanchez's free-kick at the Emirates Stadium . Jack Wilshere passes the ball away from a Sadio Mane tackle. The England star was part of a strong attacking line-up fielded by Arsene Wenger . There was no need for the gesture when Victor Wanyama brought him down. The Southampton midfielder was going into Keith Stroud’s book come what may. This was a pedestrian Arsenal performance, lacking vigour and struggling to make an impression on this tie after Tadic’s equaliser from the penalty spot. In Calum Chambers, Isaac Hayden, Francois Coquelin and Hector Bellerin, Arsenal fielded an inexperienced defence, but that is not to excuse them. They played because Wenger believes they are ready. Clyne celebrates his goal with Steven Davis (left) and Florin Gardos (right) after his thunderous strike had put Southampton into the lead for the first time . Ospina looks shellshocked after conceding the second goal on his Arsenal debut, a the strike moved in the air but went in the middle of the goal, over his head . Arsene Wenger shows his nerves as his side went in behind at half time despite having taken the lead at home to Southampton . Chambers, signed from Southampton in the summer, remains on course to become a top class player at this level. He doesn’t have the experience yet to guide this team through difficult times. Southampton are hot, sitting pretty in second place in the Barclays Premier League and proof that there is life beyond Mauricio Pochettino. Koeman did a proper number on Arsenal, fielding a near full strength team and taking advantage of the hesitancy that shows on the faces of Wenger’s players in times of distress. Sadio Mane was impressive on his Southampton debut, battling hard as Southampton dominated the midfield against another lightweight Arsenal performance . Fraser Forster made some good saves in the Southampton goal but in truth he was not tested enough by an Arsenal side with plenty of attacking talent . Arsenal had enough experience to call on, with Podolski, Sanchez, Wilshere and Rosicky providing emotional support for some of the younger players. Sadly these kids struggled to make an impact, unable to muster enough courage and good fortune to bring Arsenal back into the tie. Wenger sent for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Santi Cazorla to save them from the substitutes’ bench, but by then it all felt too late. Sadly for Arsenal this one passed them by.

"In a land where ‘We’re Number One!’ is the preferred chant from the little to the major leagues, the role of underdog is not overly prized. But maybe, just maybe, the Americans are learning to love the idea of someone else being the favourites. Just for a change. The battling defiance of their ‘soccer’ team at the World Cup captured the imagination of a public reared on a diet of domination by the USA. Or USA, USA, USA, as the folks in the bleachers are wont to sing. Now, as Tom Watson leads a relatively inexperienced side into action against one of the most heavily favoured European teams in Ryder Cup history, they’ve been presented with another opportunity to blow away all thoughts of meek capitulation. And, to use the famous military quote resurrected as a tribute to goalkeeper Tim Howard holding the line in Brazil, tell their critics: ‘Nuts!’ Butch Harmon says team USA's inexperience could actually help them in this year's Ryder Cup . According to one of the sharpest analysts in the game, this US team – a squad containing four rookies and not a single player from inside the world’s top five – will actually benefit from their rawness. Fewer Ryder Cup matches played, says Butch Harmon, means fewer scars from repeated exposure to hammerings by Europe. Swing guru Harmon, who insists that the Americans are stronger  without an out-of-form Tiger Woods dragging them down, bristles at the notion that this may be one of the worst USA teams in history. ‘I wouldn’t say it’s one of the weakest, I think it is one of the most inexperienced,’ he said, adding: ‘All of the players on the team are good players, all the players are very capable. ‘And I think the fact that it’s an inexperienced team is good for the US, because these guys that haven’t played in a lot of Ryder Cups, quite frankly, aren’t used to getting their brains beat out by the European – unlike a lot of veterans. And that brings a lot of energy to the team. Rickie Fowler has only played in one Ryder Cup, but could be his team's key man at Gleneagles . ‘These younger and less experienced players, they aren’t scarred. You go back to the 1999 – 2000 or 2001, and look at what Tiger Woods did to Ernie Els, Davis Love or Phil Mickelson, where he just beat them every time, and time again. That wears on you. ‘You’ve got Phil Mickelson, Jim Furyk, Keegan Bradley … you might have four or five at the most who played at Medinah, who were there for that great comeback by the European team last time out. ‘These young kids, they weren’t there. They didn’t experience it, they watched it - and they want to be part of this next one to have a chance to be on the team that brings the Cup back. ‘You’ve got Mickelson who has played in nine Ryder Cups, Furyk who has played in eight, and after that Zach Johnson has only played in three, and then you go down to a lot of them are first-timers, while Rickie Fowler, Bradley, Webb Simpson, they’ve all played in one apiece. Phil Mickelson is the most experienced member of the American team, having played in nine Ryder Cups . ‘These young kids, they’re not that far removed from playing in college where they are used to play as a team. When you look at the age of Rickie Fowler at 25, Patrick Reed at 24, Jordan Spieth is only 21. ‘So they understand the team atmosphere from their college days and that’s why they’re looking forward to it. They’re all talking about “Man I get to put on the red, white and blue, this is the coolest thing.” ‘And the other thing you can say about these young kids, they all played Walker Cup together. They’ve all been on Walker Cup teams and they understand it. ‘Jordan Spieth will be using the same putter cover he used in the junior Ryder Cup here - he said: “I just want the good vibes I had the last time I was at Gleneagles.”’ Harmon describes the young Yanks as ‘really jacked up for this’, which presumably means they’re quite keen to win. And to prove themselves comfortable in the distinctly un-American garb of unfancied outsiders. At just 21, Jordan Speith is the youngest member of USA's Ryder Cup team . ‘I think being an underdog gives you a little more incentive, it makes you want to show how good we are,’ said Harmon, who coaches Fowler, Mickelson and Jimmy Walker. ‘I’ve told Jimmy, who’s never even attended a Ryder Cup before, that he’s got to get ready for it, because it’s the greatest thing you will ever do in your career . ‘I told my guys: “Embrace it. You’re not ready for what you’re going to hear, but embrace it. You know there’s one way to quiet the crowd, just make a lot of birdies.” ‘The European team, when you look at where they are in world rankings, is a very strong team and they will be heavily favourite. But as you know, you have to play the match on the golf course and not on paper. Knowing all the guys on the team so well as I do, they’re all very up for it.’ The American's have only won the Ryder Cup once in the last six attempts, their last win was in 2008 . The Americans have often been accused of simply not buying into the team ethos, the friendly but very distinct us-and-them mentality, needed to triumph against the odds. None has been the target of these accusations more persistently than arch-individualist Tiger Woods. So, does his absence – partly through injury, although also because he was playing so poorly as to make a captain’s pick almost impossible for Watson, actually strengthen the away team? Harmon said: ‘Well the last time they won Tiger wasn’t on the team, whether they’re stronger…they’re stronger without Tiger the way he’s playing because he hasn’t played well. Obviously physically he couldn’t play anyway. ‘But yeah, I don’t think they lose anything by not having him at this point in time, because at this point in time he’s not the Tiger Woods that we remember.’ Sky Sports will ‘Bring The Noise’ from the 2014 Ryder Cup exclusively live on TV, mobile, online and via NOW TV including the Week Pass.

"'Esteemed journalist': The body of Dominic Di-Natale, 43, who traveled around the world with Foz News, was discovered on Wednesday . A veteran Fox News correspondent has been found dead in his Colorado apartment following an apparent suicide. The body of journalist Dominic Di-Natale, 43, who traveled around the world with the broadcaster, was discovered on Wednesday. Officials in Jefferson County were alerted by a friend of the reporter who was aware of his state of mind, relating to serious undisclosed health issues, according to the station. They confirmed that he had taken his own life. His career took him all over the globe covering top stories. He visited Osama bin Laden's compound after the terror leader's death and was in Egypt's Tarhir Square during the uprising against President Mubarak in 2011. Mr Di-Natale started working for Fox in 2007, covering world news, economics and business on a variety of platforms. A spokesman for the station said: 'We were extremely saddened to learn of Dominic’s passing and send our deepest condolences to his family and friends. 'He was an esteemed journalist and an integral part of our news coverage throughout the Middle East.' Fox anchor Megyn Kelly wrote on Twitter: 'So sad to hear Fox's Dominic Di-Natale has died. A great reporter, who off-air was always trying to help US troops. I will miss him.' Jessie Jane Duff, a former US Marine gunnery sergeant posted: 'Dominic Di-Natale loved the military & never walked away from a tough story, died at 43. Rest in peace.' Mike Emmanuel, who has been with the channel since 1997, said he was 'shocked and saddened' by the news. Mr Di-Natale, who was born in Britain, began his career in 1989 as a magazine writer in Portugal, where he covered the European drug trade. He moved to the UK in 1995, where he did freelance work for several national newspapers before taking a position as correspondent for BBC World. He spent time working in Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, London and New York. After joining Fox in 2007, he studied Arabic at Damascus University the following year - when the country was still safe - and went on to work in Baghdad, at the time one of the most dangerous assignments for a Western journalist. Following the death of bin Laden in May 2011, Mr Di-Natale chiseled a brick from the foundations of the terrorist leader's compound and donated it to the 9/11 museum in New York.

"Manchester United stars slammed the substitution of Angel di Maria during a fiery dressing-room inquest after their shocking 5-3 defeat at Leicester. Di Maria, who had scored an early contender for Barclays Premier League goal of the season to put United 2-0 up, was substituted when the score was 3-3. During scenes described by one source at the King Power Stadium as ‘very heated’, a United player was heard to say: ‘Why the f*** did we substitute Di Maria?’ Angel di Maria is substituted by Louis van Gaal with Manchester United level at 3-3 against Leicester . Di Maria (back row, centre) sits on the bench and watches United capitulate, eventually losing 5-3 . Van Gaal brought on Juan Mata (back row, centre) to replace Di Maria with less than 15 minutes remaining . The Argentina forward was United’s obvious match winner after his stunning performance against QPR the previous week. But under-fire manager Louis van Gaal, who has won just one game since he took over, withdrew the £60million signing from Real Madrid in the 76th minute. Leicester were clearly lifted when Di Maria was replaced by Juan Mata and scored twice to seal a remarkable victory. Van Gaal openly condemned his team in the dressing room following their humiliating defeat and Rafael was also criticised by a number of players for his part in the implosion. The Brazilian defender gave away a 62nd-minute penalty that allowed Leicester to claw their way back into the game. United left the stadium in such a hurry that they suffered abuse from Leicester fans when their team bus was stuck in traffic near the stadium. Di Maria had earlier scored a stunning goal to put United 2-0 up and seemingly cruising against Leicester . Di Maria celebrates his brilliant chip but his smile would soon disappear as United threw away the three points . United will not rush to sign a new centre back in January despite their alarming defensive frailties at Leicester. The shocking manner of their collapse underlined a lack of leadership and organisation and prompted the furious reaction from Van Gaal. Their problems were compounded by an ankle injury to Jonny Evans, their most experienced defender. United spent £156million in the summer but only £16m on a centre back, Marcos Rojo, who now plays predominantly at left back. The recruitment plan has been branded ‘mismanagement’ by Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher while former United defender Gary Neville said that the side now have a soft centre that all Premier League sides will attack. Though United recognise there is an issue, the central defenders who are available are not deemed of good enough quality. Rafael was adjudged to have fouled Jamie Vardy in the area to hand Leicester a way back into the game . David Nugent fired home the penalty to reduce the Foxes' arrears and enable them to launch a comeback . Esteban Cambiasso levelled the game at 3-3 with a fine strike as United's defence fell apart at the seams . Jamie Vardy kept his cool to fire the ball home and put Leicester in front for the first time in the game . Leonardo Ulloa made sure of the three points with a penalty that left keeper David de Gea with no chance . Van Gaal spoke openly about the need to address the departures of Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra if only more for their experience than performances. Yet the club had been told that Borussia Dortmund captain Mats Hummels was not for sale, Manchester City had already captured Porto’s Eliaquim Mangala and Arsenal would only deal on Thomas Vermaelen if Chris Smalling was sent the other way. Dortmund’s stance on Hummels is unlikely to change until the summer while United have reservations about the likes of Ron Vlaar at Aston Villa and Fabian Schar at Basle. Manchester United are interested in signing World Cup winner Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund . Van Gaal was clear from early August that his priority should be a left-sided centre back with an ability to bring the ball out of defence. He was alarmed that United’s defenders seemed incapable of starting attacks from defence with any real assurance. Rojo, who played for Argentina in the World Cup final, is highly regarded by Van Gaal and will get his chance at centre back against West Ham on Saturday with Evans out, Phil Jones injured and Tyler Blackett suspended. Van Gaal said: ‘I think that Luke Shaw shall be fit enough to play. Marcos Rojo can play and Chris Smalling can play, so we can manage. But it’s a thin choice.’ Marcos Rojo can play at both left back and centre back but has yet to find a settled position in United's defence . Luke Shaw has yet to convince Van Gaal that he is ready to be a regular starter under him at United . Van Gaal will meet with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward this week, as he does most weeks, and discuss his squad’s progress. He says the whole team is responsible for results such as Sunday’s defeat and not just the defence. Van Gaal has also indicated that Wayne Rooney’s future lies in midfield. Explaining his selection for Leicester in which Radamel Falcao started and Mata dropped to the bench, he said: ‘I was not so satisfied with Rooney as a striker and Mata as midfielder. That is why I changed. Rooney can play in more positions, he’s a multi-functional player.’ Rooney, talking to Sky, said: ‘I don’t think anyone can put a finger on my best position, but I am adaptable. I can go into midfield, drop out wide or play up front. It depends on where the manager wants me to play.’ Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Sir Alex Ferguson’s decision to retire understandably came as a shock to the Manchester United squad - but none took the news harder than Robin van Persie. That is the opinion of Rio Ferdinand, who revealed it was patently evident that the Dutchman struggled to cope. Ferguson had been a contributive factor in Van Persie moving to Old Trafford from Arsenal for £24million back in 2012. Robin van Persie (right) took the news of Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement badly . Van Persie alongside Radamel Falcao during the dismal 5-3 defeat away at Leicester City on Sunday . Rio Ferdinand - who moved to Queens Park Rangers in the summer - was talking to MUTV . The 31-year-old’s goals in his first season at the club were a major reason behind the Red Devils clawing the Premier League title back from Manchester City. Ferdinand told MUTV: ‘It took the wind out of everyone's sails. 'It gave us an extra push to go and win be successful in that last season. ‘Everyone was really appreciative for what he'd done for our careers. 'The person it hit more than anyone was Robin. He'd come the year before, tasted that success and wanted more. ‘Visually you could see it hit him harder than anyone else at the time.’ Van Persie struggled for form under David Moyes - whose name wasn't referenced in Ferdinand's interview - last season. There appeared to be lasting damage to the striker after Ferguson's announcement, and the Dutchman said last year: 'I had to gasp for breath and I shook my head. Had he really said what I thought he'd said? 'The room fell deathly quiet and then everyone became emotional. 'Sir Alex then had a long talk with the squad. I found it a very special speech and felt privileged to have witnessed it.' Ferdinand (celebrating with Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra) played for United for 12 years . Ferdinand was disappointed to see Welbeck (right, celebrating with Mesut Ozil) leave for Arsenal . Ferdinand, who wasn't afforded the opportunity to say an elongated goodbye to the club he'd played for since 2002, also expressed regret at Louis van Gaal allowing Danny Welbeck to go to to Arsenal on deadline day. 'I was surprised [at the move],' he added. 'Gutted really. He's a local lad and has come through from the Under eights. For him to leave was a little bit disappointing. I don't think we've seen the best of Danny. He's still got a lot more in him. 'I hope the Arsenal manager gives him the chance to be that responsible front man he wants to be.

"Brendan Rodgers has insisted that Mario Balotelli is not a ‘complicated’ player after Liverpool’s new £16million signing became embroiled in the first controversy of his Anfield career. Merseyside Police are investigating allegations of racist abuse against Balotelli after he posted a tweet mocking Manchester United’s 5-3 defeat to Leicester City on Sunday. Questions about the case were prohibited at Rodgers’s press conference at Anfield on Monday, but Rodgers voiced his support for the former Manchester City and AC Milan star who has scored once in four appearances for his new club. Brendan Rodgers said he has really enjoyed working with Mario Balotelli since he arrived at Liverpool . The Italian striker jumps out of the way of Raheem Sterling's shot as Liverpool lost at West Ham . Balotelli will always have an opportunity at Liverpool while he continues to work hard for the club . ‘Every player is different,’ said the Liverpool boss. ‘I’ve really enjoyed working with him so far. He’s a good guy, he wants to do well for the club and he’s shown he cares enough about the club to devote that time to him. ‘For me, he’s not complicated. He’s a football player who wants to do well in his life and career. If he continues to give everything and work tirelessly for the cause there will always be an opportunity here for him. Rodgers says Balotelli has already started to gel with his teammates but admits there will be slow progress . ‘It’s not just Mario it’s the whole group, a new dynamic in the group. We lost Luis (Suarez) who was a marvellous player, and had to bring in a number of players because that’s what the depth that the squad needed, we were short last year. ‘When there’s that transition there are little bumps along the way. Mario was one of a number of players we brought in and it will take time for them to gel with current players. It’s happened here already and it will happen again.’ Brendan Rodgers claimed that Balotelli is not complicted despite his controversial tweet on Sunday . Rodgers admitted that gelling new signings like Adam Lallana will take some time after Luis Suarez left . Liverpool face Middlesbrough in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night having lost three of their opening five Premier League games for only the second time in 77 years. The 3-1 defeat to West Ham on Saturday was the latest blow to a club that came within a whisker of winning the title last season. Having made eight new signings in the summer, Rodgers believes it will take time for them to adjust to playing for Liverpool. ‘What people probably don’t get is the pressure of playing for such a big club,’ he added. ‘The weight of the jersey here is heavy for most players. Once you adapt to playing for Liverpool you become clearer in your thinking. ‘We don’t have too many experienced players, it’s a young group. That adjustment takes a little bit of time. ‘We’ve conceded eight goals and the majority of those could have been avoided. We started poorly at the weekend. There are no easy games at this level, you will be tested physically and mentally at this level. You have to be ready to fight and we got caught out in those first seven minutes of the game. That’s something we have to improve on, we must do better. Rodgers bemoaned individual defensive errors that have cost Liverpool so far this season . Brendan Rodgers' side take on Middlesbrough, who won 4-0 last weekend, in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday . ‘Of course it’s not all smiles, it’s not a feeling we’ve been used to. But you have to refocus and move on. You have to be able to recover quick at this level. It’s my job to ensure confidence is retained within the group. ‘It’s not a great start by any means but that we’ll improve and my team will get better in the second half of the season. ‘We want to win a trophy this season, that is still a key objective for us and this competition gives us an opportunity. ‘We’ve been here before with the club when I first came in here, a lot of new players coming in and that time it was a new manager as well. We got to where we wanted to be.’ Rodgers revealed that Jordan Henderson and Phillip Coutinho are unlikely to play, joining Glen Johnson, Joe Allen, Daniel Sturridge, Emre Can and Jon Flanagan on the sidelines.","Mario Balotelli mocked Manchester United fans during their 5-3 defeat at Leicester on Sunday .

Demarquis Elkins, 17, and a 14-year-old boy yet to be identified are being held on suspicion of first-degree murder, Police Chief Tobe Green said, adding that authorities are still searching for a motive. Sherry West was pushing her son Antonio yards from their home in Brunswick, Georgia, early on Thursday morning when she was approached by the two boys. She said Elkins demanded money from her and threatened to kill her if she didn't give him any, but she insisted she had nothing. Scroll down for video .

They're expensive,' she said. 'And he kept asking and I just said ""I don't have it."" And he said, ""Do you want me to kill your baby?"" And I said, ""No, don't kill my baby!""' She said he fired four shots, the first into the ground. West didn't see a shell casing ejected, and said she assumed the gun wasn't real.

Several people in the neighborhood called 911 after they heard the gunshots fired, but Rhodes said investigators believed that the mother was the only witness to what happened. Police combed school records to look for any absences and canvassed neighborhoods searching for the pair. They originally believed the boys were between 10 and 15 years old.

'He and some other boys were going to ambush a kid,' Bernie Weisenfeld, a spokesman for the Gloucester County prosecutor's office, told the AP Friday. Glassey was armed with a knife, but the 17-year-old target of the attack was able to get the knife away from him 'and Glassey ended up on the wrong end of the knife,' Weisenfeld recalled.

"Former Manchester United defender Phil Neville believes the club need another £100million-plus splurge before they can again challenge for the Barclays Premier League title. Last season's seventh-placed finish in the Barclays Premier League led new manager Louis van Gaal to splash out more than £150million on Angel di Maria, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind and loan signing Radamel Falcao. United failed to sign an out-and-out centre half, however, and have struggled at the back this season as Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans battle for form and fitness and youngster Tyler Blackett seeks to establish himself.

'I think there's another two transfer windows of similar amounts of money needed - maybe £100m - before they can even think about winning the title. 'There are still key positions in the team that need filling. I think the centre-back position is obviously the key area. Holding midfield or centre midfield needs addressing too. 'There were no world-class centre backs out there (this summer). I think that's why in the next two transfer windows, United might still be looking for that world-class defender.' However, he backed England defenders Jones and Smalling to eventually prove their worth to the club. 'I am certain Chris Smalling will come good and I have full faith in Phil Jones as well,' he said.

"More than a century since one of the most remarkable scientific objects of antiquity was discovered, experts are hoping to reveal more secrets of the deep using the latest in diving technology. Greek and American archaeologists are returning to the ancient shipwreck of Antikythera using the Exosuit - a state-of-the art, deep sea diving suit - that will let them dive to more than double the depths of previous expeditions. Here, the so-called Antikythera Mechanism, a 2nd-century BC device dubbed the world's oldest computer, was discovered by sponge divers in 1900 off the remote Greek island. Scroll down for video . Archaeologists, including Brendan Foley (pictured) are returning to the ancient shipwreck of Antikythera using the Exosuit, which lets them dive to more than double the depths of previous expeditions. It was the site of the  Antikythera Mechanism, a 2nd-century BC device dubbed the world's oldest computer, found in 1900 . The highly complex mechanism consisting of up to 40 bronze cogs and gears was used by the ancient Greeks to track the cycles of the solar system. It was so advanced, it took another 1,500 years for an astrological clock of similar sophistication to be made in Europe. The Exosuit, built in Canada by Nuytco Research, lets divers reach depths of 492ft (150 metres). It is made of aluminium, with 18 joints in the arms and legs. The suit is able to supply oxygen for up to 50 hours, and maintains communication with the surface via an optical cable. It also has four 1.6 horsepower thrusters on the back to help the diver move around underwater at relatively high speeds. Each suit weighs between 35 (226kg) and 42 stone (272kg). Prices start at around £360,000 ($588,000). Now archaeologists returning to the wreck will be able to use the Exosuit to more than double the depth they can dive at, and stay safely at the bottom for longer. The Exosuit, built in Canada by Nuytco Research, lets divers reach depths of 492ft (150 metres), while still performing delicate tasks, said archaeologist Theotokis Theodoulou. Up until now, divers had only been able to operate at a depth of 196ft (60 metres). The suit, which makes the wearer resemble Buzz Lightyear, ‘expands our capabilities’, continued Mr Theodoulou, and ‘I'll be able to grasp, pluck, clench and dig... for several hours,’ he added. Archaeologists believe many other artefacts are yet to be discovered in and around the wreck. The Mechanism was found with a bronze statue of a youth in the wreck of a cargo ship apparently carrying booty to Rome, and researchers are certain that other items on board still remain to be discovered. ‘We have good signs that there are other objects present,’ said Angeliki Simosi, head of Greece's directorate of underwater antiquities, after exploratory dives in the area in 2012 and 2013. ‘There are dozens of items left, this was a ship bearing immense riches from Asia Minor,’ added Dimitris Kourkoumelis, another archaeologist on the team. The Mechanism (pictured) was recovered from a Roman cargo shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera. Previous studies have shown it was used to chart the movement of planets and the passing of days and years. Scans in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses .

The archaeologists also hope to confirm the presence of a second ship, some 820ft (250 metres) away from the original discovery site. Antikythera, which now has a population of only 44, was on one of antiquity's busiest trade routes, and a base for Cilician pirates, some of whom once captured and held the young Julius Caesar for ransom. He later had them all captured and crucified. The Greek team is assisted by Brendan Foley, a marine archaeologist from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution at Massachusetts, which was involved in a dive to the wreck of the Titanic. Foley has helped in outings to identify ancient shipwrecks over the last five years. Antikythera (highlighted) which now has a population of only 44, was on one of antiquity's busiest trade routes, and a base for Cilician pirates, some of whom once captured and held the young Julius Caesar for ransom. He later had them all captured and crucified . The Mechanism was recovered in 1900 from the Antikythera wreck - a Roman cargo shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera. It was discovered in a wooden box measuring 13 inchesx7 inchesx3.5 inches (340×180×90mm) and consists of bronze dials, gears and cogs. A further 81 fragments have since been found containing a total of 40 hand-cut bronze gears. The mechanism is said to have been created in around 100BC, and is believed to be the world’s oldest calculator. Previous studies have shown that it was used to chart the movement of planets and the passing of days and years. More than 80 fragments of the Mechanism have been found, containing a total of 40 hand-cut bronze gears (pictured) Scans of the mechanism in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses, and record important events in the Greek calendar, such as the Olympic Games. Astronomer Professor Mike Edmunds of Cardiff University said at the time: 'It is more complex than any other known device for the next 1,000 years.' The scans also revealed the mechanism was originally housed in a rectangular wooden frame with two doors, covered in instructions for its use. At the front was a single dial showing the Greek zodiac and an Egyptian calendar. On the back were two further dials displaying information about lunar cycles and eclipses. The calculator would have been driven by a hand crank. The mechanism recorded several important astronomical cycles known to the Babylonians hundreds of years before that help predict eclipses. These include the Saros cycle - a period of around 18 years separating the return of the moon, Earth and sun to the same relative positions. The device could track the movements of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn - the only planets known at the time, the position of the sun, and the location and phases of the moon. The researchers have been able to read all the month names on a 19-year calendar on the back of the mechanism. The month names are Corinthian - suggest that it may have been built in the Corinthian colonies in north-western Greece or Syracuse in Sicily. The device was created at a time when the Romans had gained control of much of Greece. The Mechanism is on display at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. ‘We may find one or more monumental statues that were left behind in 1901, in the mistaken belief that they were rocks,’ Foley said. As well as the new Exosuit, the Antikythera expedition will also use robot mapping equipment and new advanced closed-circuit ‘rebreathers’, which will allow divers much more time underwater. ‘We will have more bottom time than any previous human visitors to the site, because we dive with mixed gas rebreathers,’ the expedition's website said. ‘Each diver will have more than 30 minutes of bottom time per day, and will enjoy greater mental acuity and a larger safety margin than that of previous divers at Antikythera.’","Antikythera Mechanism was recovered in 1900 from a shipwreck in Greece .

"An Italian judge has ordered an international police hunt for a belly dancer at the centre of sex allegations surrounding former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Karima El Mahroug, 19, was due to testify at Berlusconi's trial relating to the 'bunga bunga' parties he held at his villa near Milan, but she failed to show up. Miss El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heartstealer, gave the court no warning and even her lawyer admitted he had 'no idea' where she was. The teenager is said to have been paid for sex by Berlusconi when she and dozens of other women attended his now infamous gatherings. Bad reputation: Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, left, is accused of paying 19-year-old Karima El Mahroug for sex at one of his infamous 'bunga bunga' parties . The age of consent in Italy is 14 but paying a woman for sex under the age of 18 is a crime. The Moroccan-born exotic dancer was just 17 at the time of the alleged offences. The judge at the trial in Milan ordered police to search for her 'in Italy and abroad' as she is thought to have flown to the United States last week and is not due back until after Christmas. Her sudden disappearance has prompted speculation as to who paid for her flights and accommodation. Furious prosecutor Ilda Boccassini said it was another delaying tactic by Berlusconi's legal team to ensure the trial drags into the upcoming election campaign. She stormed: 'This is yet another attempt by the defence to draw out the length of this trial. 'They have already dragged their heels with other witnesses. Today's absence is unauthorised and there is no documentation. 'I really don't believe there is any prospect of her appearing at this trial. This is a strategy to take the case into the election campaign.' Missing: The Moroccan-born dancer is thought to have flown to the U.S., but even her lawyer does not know where she is . If the trial does stretch into next year ahead of February's expected general election, Berlusconi - who announced at the weekend he would be running for office - is expected to use it as a tool in his battle for power, and say that once again it shows prosecutors are politically motivated and simply out to get him. Paola Boccardi, Miss El Mahroug's lawyer, said: 'Her mobile is switched off, as is that of her partner. She sent me a text message a few days ago which said she was abroad and that was it. I don't know when she will be back.' Berlusconi's legal team, led by slick Nicolo Ghedini, hit back at the prosecution's argument, saying it was 'intolerable and defamatory', and asked the judge to look closely at Mrs Boccassini's words. However, other witnesses that the defence had called - such as George Clooney and Cristiano Ronaldo - have also failed to show up. The Hollywood actor's spokesman denied claims from Berlusconi's legal team that he had even been summoned to appear. Berlusconi went on trial last year over the sex allegations, which focus on a series of parties he is said to have thrown at his luxury villa at Arcore near Milan. Showgirls and wannabe starlets allegedly performed erotic dances for him and were paid with cars, cash and jewellery. Both he and Miss El Mahroug deny any wrongdoing, although the teenager is said to have boasted to friends that Berlusconi gave her several thousand euros for attending the parties and that he was besotted with her. The former cruise ship crooner-turned-politician has fought numerous legal battles in his 20-year career and two months ago he was convicted of fraud. However, he has insisted all the trials he has faced are politically motivated and he is innocent of all accusations. At the weekend, when he confirmed he would be standing for prime minister in the next election, the Italian stock market plunged more than three per cent and borrowing costs soared, amid fears of a period of economic instability. The election had been due to take place in April but was brought forward two months after technocrat prime minister Mario Monti announced he would step down at the end of the month after the 2013 budget. His position was also confounded after Berlusconi's party withdrew support for him. Election hopes: Berlusconi was accused of delaying his trial after announcing he will run for PM when Mario Monti, left, steps down - despite trailing in third place behind Pier Bersani, right . Political experts say Berlusconi, 76, is unlikely to win the election since his People of Freedom party is trailing in third place behind the centre-left Democrats, who are led by Pier Luigi Bersani. Professor Christopher Duggan, an Italian historian at the University of Reading, said: 'Ever since being found guilty of tax fraud, Berlusconi has been looking to relaunch himself and his party, in order, as he says, to save Italy economically from the austerity policies of Monti and politically from a return of the left to power. 'He is also seeking to salvage his personal reputation, which stands to be further compromised by impending verdicts in criminal court cases. The move looks set to seriously destabilise the present government and induce a period of considerable political insecurity in Italy. 'Such insecurity in the third largest economy in the eurozone could have major consequences for Europe as a whole, especially if Berlusconi seeks to mobilise Italian public opinion not just against the policies of Monti but more generally against Europe and the Euro.' If convicted of having sex with an underage prostitute, Berlusconi faces a three-year jail sentence. He is also on trial for abuse of office after prosecutors said he lied to cover up for Miss El Mahroug when she was arrested for theft - wrongly telling police she was related to then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and should be freed.","The 19-year-old exotic dancer is thought to have flown to the U.S. with no plans to return until after Christmas .

"A popular high school cheerleader is fighting for her life in a medically-induced coma after a weekend trip to visit her brother in college ended in tragedy. Tampa, Florida 18-year-old Jackie Faircloth was visiting her older brother J.T. at Florida State University in Tallahassee, when she was hit by a truck crossing the road after a football game around 2am on November 29. 'She stepped out into the road and I yelled, ""Jackie, there's a car, look out,'' J.T. told WTSP. Driver Devon Dwyer, 20, never stopped to help the Plant High School cheerleader, but was arrested two days later when the passenger in the car notified authorities. Fighting for her life: 18-year-old Jackie Faircloth was struck by a hit-and-run driver crossing the street in Tallahassee, Florida late last month, and remains in medically-induced coma . Accident: The Tampa, Florida high-schooler was visiting her brother J.T. (pictured together on the left) at Florida State University when she was hit by 20-year-old Devon Dwyer (right). Dwyer fled the scene but was later arrested . Jackie was rushed to the hospital in critical condition, where doctors placed her in a medically induced coma so she could recover from her injuries which included major head trauma, serious chest injury, a broken jaw and ear drum. The swelling in Jackie's brain went down substantially this week, enough to allow doctor's to perform a crucial surgery and she is responding to medication. But she remains in a coma. On Monday, driver Devon Dwyer, a former standout high school football player in Orlando who went on to play at Western Illinois University for two seasons, was arrested and charged with fleeing the scene of an accident. Dwyer's friend Jacob Sallow, a FSU junior,  went to the police on Monday to identify Dwyer as the hit-and-run driver. Sallow was in Dwyer's red pickup truck when he hit Faircloth, as the two were driving home from working a shift at PotBelly's Bar. Sallow says he didn't see Dwyer hit Jackie, since he was looking down at his cellphone at the moment, but  'heard impact of a person hitting the bottom side of the driver side windshield' and saw the windshield shatter like a spider-web. Popular: Hundreds gathered to hold a candlelight vigil for Jackie outside her high school last week . Recovering: Jackie remains in a coma, but swelling in her brain has gone down considerably and she is reacting to medication . Smiles: According to photos posted to her Facebook, Jackie is an active young woman who enjoys fishing, swimming and paddle-boarding . 'He stated that Dwyer became very panicky, but continued driving and never slowed down or stopped the vehicle,' according to the police report. '[Salow] stated Dwyer kept looking over at him and was saying, ""It's not my fault. She stepped in front of the car.""' After the crash,  Dwyer continued to a friend's house where Sallow had his girlfriend pick him up. As she arrived, Dwyer 'was yelling at a few of his friends that he needed to hide his vehicle'. Police were able to recover the vehicle when they arrested Dwyer and booked him into Leon County Jail Monday night. He is no longer listed as an inmate there though, according to the jail's website. It's unclear why Dwyer was afraid to stop the car, since hitting a pedestrian does not usually become a criminal act until the driver flees the scene, according to Florida state law. The Faircloth family had previously offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the driver's arrest, but Sallow's lawyer said he did not know about it when he came forward. Sallow has told the family he does not want the reward, and would rather it be spent on Jackie's medical bills. Reward: Jackie's family initially offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the driver . Meanwhile, the Plant High School community has been shaken by Jackie' absence from school, and last week held a candlelight vigil in front of the school. Friends have also been organizing prayer schedules, to make sure someone is praying for Jackie every 15 minutes, as well as group prayer sessions before school. Her friends have described her as a popular girl who many looked up to. 'She has a lot of friends. She brings a lot of smiles to people's faces. She's someone the younger girls look up to. She's a roll model to them, so it's traumatizing,' said Jackie's cousin Rex Culpepper. Rex Culpepper is the son of Brad Culpepper, a retired football player who once played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and University of Florida.","Jackie Faircloth was visiting her brother at Florida State University on November 29 when she as hit crossing the street around 2am .

"A new study has found salt consumption is not linked to higher blood pressure . Doctors have long warned of the dangers of a high-salt diet. But a new study has revealed sodium does not cause high blood pressure, and the link between the two is 'more complex than once believed'. Hypertension is the most prevalent chronic disease across the world. Known as a 'silent killer' high blood pressure rarely has obvious symptoms. Around 30 per cent of people in England have hypertension, but many are unaware. Meanwhile in the U.S. 67 million adults (31 per cent) suffer the condition. Scientists analysed data from 8,670 French adults and concluded the assumption that salt causes higher blood pressure is 'overstated'. Their aim was to evaluate the impact of lifestyle and nutritional factors on blood pressure levels. Despite finding no direct link, the authors of the study did note those patients who were hypertensive (had a high blood pressure) consumed much higher levels of salt than those without the condition. Their findings suggest salt affects people in different ways. Researchers found other lifestyle factors including alcohol consumption, age, and most importantly body mass index (BMI) were all strongly linked to a rise in blood pressure. Eating more fruit and vegetables, on the other hand, acted to reduce hypertension. The study authors, said: 'Stopping weight increase should be the first target in the general population to counteract the hypertension epidemic,' TIME reported. The study added: 'BMI was the main contributory modifiable factor of BP level after multiple adjustments. 'Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was higher in participants with elevated BMIs. Alcohol intake was positively associated with SBP in both sexes. 'Salt intake was not associated with SBP in either sex after multiple adjustments.' However the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the U.S. yesterday issued a warning that nine in 10 schoolchildren are eating more salt than is recommended. Almost half comes from 10 processed foods - pizza, bread, savory snacks, sandwiches, cheese, processed meats, processed chicken, pasta dishes, soup and Mexican dishes. The report said  one in six children has raised blood pressure, which can be lowered in part by a healthy diet, including less sodium. Janelle Gunn, from the CDC, told TIME: 'We consider the totality of the evidence. 'A vast majority of scientific research confirms that as sodium is reduced, so is blood pressure.' The review of more than 8,000 French adults found body mass index (BMI) had the greatest affect on raised blood pressure levels .","Study of more than 8,000 French adults found no link between salt consumption and high blood pressure .

"A nanny has been charged with assaulting a three-year-old boy that she was supposed to be caring for in Sherborn, Massachusetts. Mareike Arbeiter, 23, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with one count of domestic assault and battery. Arbeiter arrived from Germany six weeks ago to act as an au pair to the two young children of the unnamed family who alerted police to the assault. Mareike Arbeiter, 23, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with one count of domestic assault and battery . They became suspicious after their kids started acting up and so set up hidden cameras to keep an eye on their nanny. Prosecutors say they have video evidence of her violently shoving a toddler to the ground on Tuesday, reports WCVB. Sherborn police arrested Arbeiter on Wednesday at the home where she lived and was supposed to be caring for the 3-year-old boy she is accused of assaulting and his 1-year-old sister. 'When the police spoke to her about physically assaulting my son, she was very cold,' the child's father told the judge as he sought a restraining order on the family's behalf. 'She told them, 'He was driving me crazy.' She had no regret.' The father told the judge that he noticed both children had been 'acting up' lately and said he had a 'gut feeling' that Arbeiter may have been to blame. Sherborn police arrested Arbeiter on Wednesday at the home where she lived and was supposed to be caring for the 3-year-old boy she is accused of assaulting and his 1-year-old sister . The German woman had only been an au pair for a family in the upscale Massachusetts town of Sherborn for six weeks . Reviewing video footage he'd taken of the nanny on Wednesday, he caught an assault that had occurred the previous day. 'She grabbed him by the shoulder and shoved him hard enough that his head snapped back and he fell to the ground,' the father said. 'She left the room, and then came back, and instead of walking around him, she stepped over him. He was face down, crying.' Though there were no visible injuries on the child, the father said his wife had taken the boy to the doctors as a precaution. The judge granted the restraining order and Arbeiter is banned from having any contact with the family. She was ordered held on $2,000 cash bail and is due back in court next month. Sherborn police have taken Arbeiter's passport, and Au Pair In America, the company that connected her to the family, are providing her with somewhere to stay until the case was resolved. 'We take any such allegations seriously and we have launched an investigation into the issue,' said a spokesperson for the company.","Mareike Arbeiter, 23, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with one count of domestic assault and battery .

"The chief executive of SeaWorld, has resigned following low visitor numbers in the wake of a 2013 film, Blackfish, which criticised its treatment of killer whales . SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. said Thursday Jim Atchison is stepping down as head of the company and named its chairman as interim leader. Attendance at its theme parks has been weak since the recession and has dropped in three of the past four quarters. SeaWorld has also been battling negative publicity since the release of 'Blackfish' last year, a documentary that suggested its treatment of animals may have led to the death of trainers. SeaWorld has been trying to combat the decline with a turnaround effort. It said Thursday that it will eliminate an unspecified number of jobs as part of previously announced cost cuts, which are expected to save $50 million annually. Scroll down for video . Resignation: SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. said Thursday that its CEO Jim Atchison (seen in 2010) is stepping down as head of the company and named its chairman as interim leader . Image crisis: 'Blackfish' suggested SeaWorld's treatment of animals may have led to the death of trainers. Tilikum the whale, who features prominently in the film and killed a trainer, is seen here . The company would not say how many jobs it planned to cut. Jim Atchison has served as CEO and president since 2009. He will become vice chairman and will be nominated to the board of its independent nonprofit conservation fund. The Orlando Sentinel, citing a SEC filing, reported that Atchison's exit package includes a payment of $2.4million and a $440,000 consulting fee for three years. In a company release, Atchison said 'It has been an honor to lead SeaWorld. I am so proud of this Company and our dedicated team members. I look forward to serving as Vice Chairman and continuing to work with the Board, David, and our exceptional team to assure a smooth transition.' Chairman David D'Alessandro will take over as interim CEO January 15 and serve until a permanent replacement is found. D'Alessandro said in the release 'On behalf of the entire Board, I'd like to thank Jim for his contributions to the Company and express our ongoing support for our long-term strategy. Jim has helped the Company realize its vision of becoming a leader in the theme park industry, one of the world's foremost zoological organizations and a global leader in animal care. New leadership: Chairman David D'Alessandro will take over as interim CEO January 15 and serve until a permanent replacement is found. Shamu and another whale are seen right . He continued 'We remain committed to our growth agenda and enhancing value for our shareholders. The Board intends to complete the search process deliberately and thoughtfully to find the right individual with the experience and qualifications to lead the Company into the future.' The company on Thursday also appointed two new directors to its board: Ellen Tauscher, a former congresswoman from California, and former advertising executive William Gray. Gray has also been a senior adviser to Blackstone, an investment firm and minority shareholder in SeaWorld. Shares of SeaWorld, which operates 11 theme parks across the country, rose 16 cents in extended trading. Its stock closed Thursday up 45 cents to $16.09. The Orlando, Florida-based company's shares have lost about 45 percent in the past year. Gabriela Cowperthwaite, Blackfish's director, told The Hollywood Reporter Thursday 'As far as the restructuring, seems like they're rearranging chairs on the Titanic. I don't hear that they're shifting in step with an informed public. Meaningful change would involve sea sanctuaries and an entire shift toward rehab release programs. But If the new guard wants to shift the paradigm, I'm all ears.'","SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. said Thursday that its CEO is stepping down as head of the company and named its chairman as interim leader .

"It's available in quilted, coloured and scented varieties, but the more refined sections of society are turning away from toilet paper in search of something softer. The residents of Kensington and Chelsea are switching to wet wipes for that 'clean in between' feeling. But the fashion for these 'unflushables' is putting a strain on London's aging drains. Now, water bosses have declared war on wet wipes in a bid to reduce their £12million annual bill for unblocking sewers. For posh posteriors: There is a growing trend for wet wipes in the country's classier cubicles . 'Wet wipes don’t break down like loo . roll does, and can cause nasty blockages in our sewers', said Thames Water executive Nick Sumption. UK sales of wet wipes are rising by 15per cent annually. And with a £1.99 pack of 42 wipes costing the same as 840 sheets of loo paper, it is a comfort confined to the upper crust. Indeed, Mr Suption says: 'Because [wet wipes] are not cheap to buy, it may be more of a problem in places like Kensington and Chelsea.' Thames Water spends £12 million on . clearing about 80,000 blockages a year. It estimates three-quarters of . these could be caused by wet wipes. The company is urging people to use a new foam that is sprayed onto lavatory paper, and breaks down more easily than wet wipes. It . has teamed up with Gloucestershire-based company Freshu, whose . antibacterial gel can be squirted into ordinary loo paper to make it . feel just like a wet wipe - but with none of the sewer-blocking dangers . Disgusting: Thames Water 'flusher' Danny Brackley digging out a hideous bloackage of wet wipes and congealed fat from under Leicester Square in London . Money down the drain: Thames Water bosses say the wipes account for up to 75per cent of sewer blockages, costing up to £12m a year to fix . 'We have to adapt to the changes in our customers’ behaviour', said Mr Sumption. Every day, Thames Water supplies 2,600million litres of fresh water to 8.5million customers in Greater London and the Thames Valley. But this operation is dwarfed by its 14million sewerage customers, who produce 4billion litres of waste water every day. Despite a number of major infrastructure projects, London's 150-year-old sewer system is struggling to cope with the volume. The increase in waste wet wipes is compounding another big headache for Thames Water - fatty food. Fat can be poured down the plughole when warm but sets into hard 'fatbergs' when it cools down in the sewers. Wipes then stick to the congealed fat causing more serious blockages. Freshu foam is the brainchild of Oxford University graduate Dr Daniel Darg, who came up with the idea in 2009 to moisten loo roll without it disintegrating. 'We are pleased to join Thames Water in the on-going battle against sewer abuse', he said. The Boots website has everything you need to feel really 'clean in between' Andrex Washlets toilet tissue wipes'Enriched with aloe to gently moisturise the skin' (£1.33) Halo moist toilet tissue wipes'Fresh & gentle cleansing with a mild chamomile formula' (£1.09 for 10 wipes) Kandoo sensitive wipes'Help your child master toilet time' (£2.03 for 50 wipes) Boots moist toilet tissue'Leaves you feeling really fresh' (£1.09 for 40 wipes) 'If used at all pre-moistened wipes should be binned, not flushed, as per Thames Water’s 'Bin it - don’t block it' motto. 'However, with a bottle of Freshu on hand, why would you need to? A squirt of Freshu gives toilet roll all the cleansing power of a wipe but with none of the sewer-blocking risk.' A spokesman for Andrex said: 'As the UK’s leading toilet tissue brand we take the issue of flushability and the environment very seriously. Our Washlets toilet tissue wipes are flushable, biodegradable and are thoroughly tested...We have also worked with the water waste industry in the UK to understand flushability and sustainability issues. 'Ultimately, we strive to ensure that all of our toilet tissue products adhere to industry standards, are clearly labelled and utilised in the most environmentally friendly way . Thames Water acquired 60% more sewers on . October 1 2011 following a law change that transferred ownership of . privately-owned sections of sewer to water companies.","UK wet wipe sales rising by 15per cent year on year .

"A gang of men attacked an American student while he was drinking in the street - grabbing a glass bottle from his hands and smashing it over his head, a court was told. Francesco Hounye, 23, from Florida, had been in Britain for just three days when he was set upon by the men while he was walking home with a friend in Shadwell, east London. Shaleem Uddin, 20, . Shadhat Hussain, 19, Kamrul Hussain, 22, and Massom Rahman, 22, targeted . Mr Hounye when they saw him swigging from a bottle of Jagermeister. Scroll down for video . American student Francesco Hounye, 23, centre, was walking home with friends when he was attacked by a group of men. They chased him before snatching his bottle of Jagermeister and smashing him over the head with it . The American student was walking in east London when the mob, pictured, attacked him - kicking him in the head before smashing him over the head with the bottle . They then chased him, beat him, and smashed the bottle over his head, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. CCTV footage shows Mr Hounye being kicked mercilessly as he lay crouched in the road. The student suffered extensive injuries - including a smashed eye socket. A fourth man, Samad Uddin, 24, is on trial for grievous bodily harm after the four others admitted their roles in the attack. Uddin claims he is a victim of mistaken identity. Paul Casey, prosecuting, said: 'This case involves a group attack involving all five of these men on one person, Mr Francesco Hounye. 'The prosecution's case, in a nutshell, is that he was caused injuries, really serious injuries - grievous bodily harm. The footage shows Mr Hounye attempting to make an escape as the group continue to hit him. Four of the men have admitted GBH - one with intent - following the attack last June . The court heard how the student, who had only been in the country for three days, was too scared to go out after the brutal attack. Samad Uddin, 24, denies GBH with intent - and says he is a victim of mistaken identity . The footage appears to show Mr Hounye being kicked mercilessly as he lay crouched in the road (pictured) 'All of them were willingly involved in that attack, all of them played a part. 'Two in particular played the most serious role, Shaleem Uddin and Samad Uddin. 'Shaleem Uddin used the bottle to strike Mr Hounye over the head, causing him severe cuts to the side of his head. 'Immediately prior to that, Samad Uddin and a number of others were involved trying to wrestle the bottle from Mr Hounye.' 'During the course of the attack Samad Uddin aimed a number of kicks to Mr Hounye whilst he was prone on the ground, including one which CCTV shows his right foot connecting with some force with Mr Hounye's head.' The student from Florida (pictured in hospital) suffered series facial injuries in the attack - and was left with a smashed eye socket . Mr Hounye, who was too terrified to go out in London after the incident and has since returned to Florida, was attacked while with a friend on New Road, east London, on June 17 last year. Mr Casey continued: 'Both of them had been drinking alcohol and Mr Hounye had a bottle of liquor with him - the brand was Jagermeister. 'They passed a group of young males and this group of young males - principally the five defendants - attempted to speak to the two men. 'The two men perceived their attitude and body language to be threatening and intimidating so they continued on their way.' Masoon Rahman, 22, pictured, has admitted GBH - but other alleged gang member Samad Uddin, 24, denies GBH with intent . But the gang pursued the pair of friends down the road and to the junction with Commercial Road. 'When they reached the junction the two men stopped and they attempted to speak to the men who were following them. 'The two men were confronted and surrounded.' In the CCTV footage a man said to be Samad Uddin can be seen taking hold of Mr Hounye's shoulder. The victim was then grabbed from behind by a second male and other members of the gang wrestled the bottle from his clutches. 'The first punches are thrown at Mr Hounye, the bottle is wrestled from him, Shelim Hussain smashes him over the head with the bottle,' said Mr Casey. It is alleged that Samad Uddin is the man seen kicking Mr Hounye across the road after he broke free and attempted to flee. Mr Hounye was then pounced on by the mob - with the student punched against the wall . 'He is kicked and punched by a man, the prosecution say is Samad Uddin,' said Mr Casey. Mr Hounye was crouching in the street while a thin figure, claimed to be Uddin, aiming a forceful kick to the side of his head. The gang ran off when a passer-by intervened. Uddin was arrested in April this year after he was recognised by a police officer who had seen the CCTV footage, the court was told. Samad Uddin, of Shadwell, east London, denies causing GBH with intent. Shaleem Uddin, of Whitechapel, has admitted GBH with intent. Kamrul Hussain, also of Whitechapel, Shahdat Hussain, of Newham and Masoom Hussain of Whitechapel, have admitted causing grievous bodily harm. The trial continues.

The so-called 'Pineapple Express' is an atmospheric river of moisture that often brings major weather events to North America's Pacific Coast. The system is named for its origins in Hawaii, around where it gets its massive moisture content. Via NOAA.gov: . Atmospheric Rivers (AR) are relatively narrow regions in the atmosphere that are responsible for most of the horizontal transport of water vapor outside of the tropics. While ARs come in many shapes and sizes, those that contain the largest amounts of water vapor, the strongest winds, and stall over watersheds vulnerable to flooding, can create extreme rainfall and floods. These events can disrupt travel, induce mud slides, and cause catastrophic damage to life and property. However, not all ARs cause damage – most are weak, and simply provide beneficial rain or snow that is crucial to water supply. An average of between 30 to 50 percent of the total precipitation for the year on the West Coast comes from ARs. The biggest events among them can transport in the form of water vapor between 7.5 and 15 times the average flow of liquid water at the mouth of the mighty Mississippi.

"The chairman of Korean Air has apologized  for the behavior of his adult daughter who delayed a flight in an incident now dubbed 'nut rage.'

Shortly after her father's apology, Cho Hyun-ah also made a deep bow in her first public appearance since the December incident. She was meeting with transport ministry officials who are investigating whether she violated aviation safety law. Clad in a long black coat, she lowered her head as she made brief comments before droves of journalists without making eye contact. Her trembling voice was inaudible on a live television broadcast. Her actions caused uproar in South Korea and abroad. South Korean media called the 40-year-old a princess and some Koreans said she was an international embarrassment to her country.

"Forget your quest to take the perfect selfie, a new trend is set to sweep the internet that requires more than just a well-angled pout. Called the ‘donut selfie’, it involves using panoramic video shots of your head to create a seamless selfie that travels across different locations . The technique was created by ex-Microsoft employee Karen Cheng while she was experimenting with sweeping camera motions. Scroll down for video . ‘I did one that was from one side of my head to the other - made a donut around my head - and the video started looping and woahhhh that looks cool,’ explained Ms Cheng. ‘Soon enough I was running all around the city trying to get cool shots, playing with slo mo effects and iPhone lens attachments, and this is the result.’ The social media star has since released a video that shows the camera spinning around her head, with the scenery changing each time from her workplace, to a train station and even her bed. Ms Cheng explains that you can create your own doughnut selfie using the front-facing camera on a smartphone. The technique was created by ex-Microsoft employee Karen Cheng (pictured) while she was experimenting with sweeping camera motions to create various optical illusions . ‘I did one that was from one side of my head to the other - made a doughnut around my head - and the video started looping and woahhhh that looks cool,’ explained creator Karen Cheng (pictured) Starting from one side of your temple, arc the phone around your head, across your face and to the other side, while capturing scenery in the background. This gives the impression to viewers that they are passing through a subject’s head and arriving in a different location each time, said Ms Cheng. The process can be repeated as many times as needed and in as many like as you’d like, with the clips edited together using an app. Ms Cheng, who is based in San Francisco, created her video using an iPhone and edited it with iMovie. She has put together a three-part tutorial as part of a dedicated website describing the technique.

A Swedish tech start-up has launched an app for Apple devices that lets people take photos of themselves without having to touch their screens. Using touchless technology, which it says is ideal for taking 'selfies' or 'groupies', Crunchfish's GoCam app lets users trigger photos or videos from a distance with just hand gestures. Photos can be triggered from a distance of up to 10 ft (3 metres), the company claims. The technology uses something known as Touchless A3D software which detects and tracks different gestures. It does this using a video stream from the camera in the mobile phone, picking up on particular movements, such as a wave of a hand. The company, based in the southern Swedish city of Malmo, says the free GoCam app is currently only available in Sweden and Australia.","Technique created by ex-Microsoft employee Karen Cheng from California .

"He is one of the finest players to grace the European stage, deciding countless matches with his flawless passing and unforgettable goals. With Milan, Andrea Pirlo twice lifted the European Cup - first in 2003 after they beat Juventus on penalties at Old Trafford and again in 2007 when they defeated Liverpool 2-1 in Athens. And when the Italian master's time with Internazionale and Juventus is included, he has played in a total of 130 European matches. So the 35-year-old legend is certainly well placed to select his Champions League dream team. Here's his selections. Italian legend Andrea Pirlo has selected his Champions League dream team . Pirlo (left) celebrates with goalscorer Filippo Inzaghi during the 2007 Champions League win over Liverpool . GOALKEEPER . Gianluigi Buffon . The veteran Italian goalkeeper and Pirlo’s team-mate at Juventus is certainly no stranger to European football, having played 124 Champions League and UEFA Cup games during his long and distinguished career. Pirlo’s verdict: ‘He has been at the top for so long. He makes saves that no other goalkeeper in the world can make. He knows how to command the defence and give confidence to them.’ Gianluigi Buffon celebrates during a match with Celtic in the Champions League in March 2013 . DEFENCE . Philipp Lahm . The full back has been an integral part of the Bayern Munich side that has dominated German football in the last few years and also enjoyed plenty of success in Europe too. Bayern won the Champions League in 2013, beating Borussia Dortmund in the Wembley final, and were also runners-up, to Inter Milan in 2010 and Chelsea in 2012. Pirlo’s verdict: ‘One of those players who never makes mistakes, always so reliable for Germany and Bayern. Probably doesn’t always get the credit, because it's just so normal for him to be playing at such a high level now.’ Bayern Munich full back Philipp Lahm takes on Xabi Alonso of Real Madrid in the semi-finals last season . Paolo Maldini . A giant of the European game and master of the defensive art, Maldini won 26 trophies during his glittering 24-year career with Milan. The former Italy player made a colossal 161 European appearances for the club, lifting the European Cup on five occasions (1989, 1990, 1994, 2003 and 2007). He also reached another three finals in Europe’s grandest competition (1993, 1995 and 2005). Pirlo’s verdict: ‘A defender who could read the game like nobody else, so intelligent and always so calm on the ball. One of the true greats, for both Italy and Milan.’ Milan's Paolo Maldini poses with the trophy after winning the European Cup for the fifth time in 2007 . Fabio Cannavaro . Another great exponent of the Italian philosophy on defending, Cannavaro played in Europe for Napoli, Parma, Inter, Juventus and Real Madrid, clocking up more than 100 games on the continental stage. He won 136 caps for Italy and was instrumental in their 2006 World Cup triumph. Pirlo’s verdict: ‘A true leader that didn’t need to ask for respect, but naturally got it. Without doubt one of the best central defenders to have ever played.’ Fabio Cannavaro (left), then at Juventus, gets to grips with Liverpool's Milan Baros during a meeting in 2005 . Cafu . A man who brought Brazilian flair to the art of defending, Cafu was as bold going forward in attack as he was in the tackle at the back. His long and illustrious career received its crowning glory when he lifted the European Cup with Milan in 2007. Pirlo’s verdict: ‘Trend-setting in being one of the first truly great attacking full backs. Excellent at getting forward, but very strong defensively as well.’ Cafu and Liverpool's Jamie Carragher make a point during the 2005 Champions League final in Istanbul . MIDFIELD . Paul Scholes . With his flawless passing and crunching challenges, Scholes excelled on the European stage with Manchester United. He twice got his hands on the European Cup  - although he was suspended for the 1999 final before playing his part in the win over Chelsea in Moscow in 2008. Pirlo’s verdict: ‘The truly great English midfield player of the generation. Didn’t just play the game, he thought about the game. You could see every pass, every decision, was based on his intelligence and understanding.' Paul Scholes gets his hands on the European cup for the second time after Man United beat Chelsea in 2008 . Gennaro Gattuso . The ultimate shield for a defence, Gattuso was powerful, energetic and committed in every game in which he played. With Milan, he twice lifted the European Cup, in 2003 and 2007. Pirlo’s verdict: ‘Rino is the opposition’s nightmare. Even in a training game, he plays like it is the World Cup final. The style of his game allows his team-mates time on the ball. Every team needs a Gattuso.’ Gennaro Gattuso sends Barcelona's Deco flying with a challenge from behind in a 2004 European game . Xavi . Spanish hero and midfield passing perfectionist who continues to be outstanding for Barcelona and has achieved everything in the game. This includes winning the Champions League on three occasions (2006, 2009 and 2011). Pirlo’s verdict: ‘Another intelligent midfield player. Didn’t need to spend the whole time running but would control so many games for Barcelona and Spain with his intelligence and range of passing.’ Xavi celebrates with his winners' medal after Barcelona beat Manchester United in the 2011 final at Wembley . ATTACK . Kaka . Brazilian superstar who, at the peak of his powers in the mid-to-late noughties was arguably the best in the world. Played in 94 European matches in his two spells with Milan and four seasons at Real Madrid and won the Champions League with the Italian side in 2007. Pirlo’s verdict: ‘I remember how badly we took it as a team when Kaka left Milan. For two or three years he was the best player in the world. There was a point when teams just had no idea how to stop him.’ Kaka (left) lifts the European Cup after Milan's win over Liverpool in the 2007 final in Athens . Lionel Messi . Without question one of the greatest players to ever grace the game, Messi has achieved so much for his 27 years. This includes three European Cups with Barcelona – against Arsenal in 2006, and Manchester United in both 2009 and 2011. He is the all-time leading scorer in the competition and has an incredible 75 goals in 94 matches. Pirlo’s verdict: ‘Has achieved so much, but still I am sure will achieve so much more. I don’t need to talk in detail about what he is capable of. Everybody knows he is one of the greatest ever already.’ Lionel Messi has won the Champions League on three occasions - in 2006, 2009 and 2011 (pictured) Fillipo Inzaghi . One of the deadliest strikers to emerge from Italy, Inzaghi scored 70 goals in 114 European matches for Parma, Juventus and Milan. The present manager of Milan, Inzaghi also won the Champions League twice (in 2003 and 2007). Pirlo’s verdict: ‘Just the perfect goal scorer. We had this most incredible understanding. We did not even have to look for each other. He knew what pass I would make and I knew where he would be. You gave him a chance and he would take it.’ Filippo Inzaghi kisses the European Cup after Milan's triumph over Liverpool in the 2007 final .","Italy legend Andrea Pirlo has picked his Champions League dream team .

"Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg encouraged the BBC to give airtime to organisations that promote the legalisation of drugs including heroin . Nick Clegg encouraged the BBC to give airtime to organisations that promote the legalisation of drugs including heroin, it was revealed yesterday. Before the publication of a highly controversial report on drugs, the Deputy Prime Minister’s office tried to persuade the Corporation to introduce the campaigners as ‘third voices’ in the debate. They included some activists who believe our current drugs laws are a breach of human rights. The disclosure of an aide’s attempt to spin the BBC’s presentation of the report, which compared the drugs policies of different countries, came as a major row erupted up within the Coalition over the issue. In the wake of the publication of the Home Office report, Liberal Democrats called for radical change to Britain’s drug laws. They hailed the report as ‘overwhelming’ proof that there was no benefit to having tough penalties on drugs, with Mr Clegg accusing the Tories of having a ‘totally misplaced, outdated, backward-looking view’. He even suggested the report should be ‘a wake-up call’ for David Cameron and Ed Miliband. But others pointed out that the report explicitly stated it would be ‘inappropriate’ to claim its findings supported a case for legalisation – and acknowledged that drug use in the UK, where there are tough penalties for dealing and possession, had decreased markedly in recent years. Meanwhile, countries where laws have been liberalised have seen a substantial rise in drug use. Downing Street said the report provided ‘no support whatsoever’ for decriminalisation. And Mr Cameron attacked Mr Clegg’s remarks, saying drugs posed a danger to young people and that as a father he would never suggest they were safe. ‘The evidence is, what we are doing is working,’ he said. ‘I don’t believe in decriminalising drugs that are illegal today. 'I’m a parent with three children, I don’t want to send a message that taking drugs is okay or safe, it simply isn’t – it’s a danger. ‘The biggest problem we have is these so-called legal highs, drugs that are sold openly and are the real danger for young people. David Cameron held a PM Direct at an O2 Call Centre in Runcorn, Cheshire, today - in which he rejected calls for drugs to be decriminalised . ‘I want us to have tougher powers so that we ban legal highs, take them off the high street and protect more of our young people.’ Mr Clegg’s attempt to manipulate the BBC came in the hours before the official publication of the Home Office report. An aide working for the Deputy Prime Minister sent journalists on the flagship Radio 4 Today programme and other current affairs shows an email picking out the Lib Dems’ favoured passages, many of which amounted to arguments for decriminalisation. Astonishingly, the email from special adviser Phil Reilly recommended that producers and reporters at the BBC and other broadcasters contact Niamh Eastwood of Release and Danny Kushlick of Transform. Release, a charity founded in the 1960s to give legal and other help to drug users, is calling for the decriminalisation of drug possession offences in the UK. Transform, a charity, campaigns for the legalisation of drugs. It states on its website that ‘prohibition doesn’t work and never will’. Today producers rejected the aide’s advice, instead interviewing Lib Dem home office minister Norman Baker, who wants drug laws relaxed, and Tory MP Michael Ellis, who is opposed to legalising drugs. A spokesman for Mr Clegg said: ‘The Deputy Prime Minister has been very clear that he does not support the legalisation of drugs and does not endorse the campaigning positions of any particular organisation. ‘These are two respected organisations in this field and it is entirely understandable that the media would want to speak with them.’ The Home Office report followed a series of visits by Mr Baker to countries with varying policies on drugs. It suggested that tough penal regimes are no more successful than liberal decriminalised systems at reducing levels of drug abuse. A key country on Mr Baker’s tour was Portugal, which decriminalised drugs in 2001. The report claimed, controversially, that the policy has been a success. Mr Baker said: ‘Britain’s drug laws need a radical change. Ending prison sentences for drug users would give us more time to crack down on the criminal gangs that supply illegal drugs.’ Mr Clegg accused the Tories of taking a ‘facile’ approach to the issue. Lib Dem sources accused Mr Cameron of hypocrisy, pointing out that as a backbench MP he took a relatively liberal approach. In 2002 he said it was ‘baffling’ that the then Labour government was not looking at decriminalisation. Yesterday, Mr Cameron called the Home Office report ‘interesting’ but added: ‘I don’t think anyone can read that report and say it definitely justifies this approach or that approach.’ Commons Health Committee chairman Sarah Wollaston warned against ‘giving succour’ to drug addicts. Dr Wollaston, a former GP, said: ‘I don’t have any moralistic view on taking drugs other than the fact that I object to people supporting one of the most evil businesses and cartels worldwide. 'It always surprises me that people who would perhaps object to buying coffee in Starbucks and would refuse to support Amazon are quite happy to support these cartels that cause untold misery to hundreds of thousands around the world.’ What the Lib Dems didn't mention . On his tour of television and radio studios in the wake of the Home Office report, Nick Clegg declared it was clear evidence of an urgent need to relax drugs laws. But the 55-page document throws up countless findings that contradict him – and which he conveniently declined to mention. Even Lib Dem home affairs minister Norman Baker, writing in the foreword, said there were ‘positive signs that [the Government’s] approach is working’. Nick Clegg's stance on the drug debate was undermined by the 55-page report after he declared there was clear evidence of an urgent need to relax drug laws . He cited the ‘long-term downward trend’ of drug use, the fall in heroin and cocaine users in England to below 300,000 for the first time and that those in treatment are ‘more likely than ever to leave free from addiction’. Clegg’s stance is again undermined, when the report states: ‘There is robust evidence that drug use among adults has been on a downward trend since the mid-2000s.’ Drug use in adults in the past year peaked at 12.3 per cent in 2003-04 and had fallen to 8.8 per cent in the latest surveys. The figures for users aged 11 to 15 also fell, from 20 to 11 per cent. The Deputy Prime Minister ignored a section rubbishing claims that decriminalisation reduced the burden on police, which stated: ‘The number of people coming into formal contact with the police for possession offences has remained broadly stable.’ The report supported tougher punishments, saying: ‘We heard arguments both for decriminalisation and “zero tolerance” policies … and all were able to demonstrate some success.’ The Lib Dems cited Portugal, where possession of small amounts of drugs ceased to be a criminal offence in 2001, as an example to follow. They said the number of drug users had not increased since the laws were relaxed and said health problems, including Aids and HIV, had fallen. The report has put the Coalition on a collision path and its concluding observation emphatically does not back decriminalisation of drugs . But the report said the health improvements may be linked to a significant funding boost for healthcare rather than slackening drugs laws, adding: ‘With regard to Portugal … it is difficult to disentangle the effect of decriminalisation from wider improvements in treatment and harm reduction during the same period.’ Mr Clegg failed to mention the Czech Republic, which had similar drug possession laws to Portugal yet had ‘levels of cannabis use among the highest in Europe’. The report’s concluding observation emphatically does not back decriminalisation of drugs. The problem was ‘more complex and nuanced than legislation and enforcement alone,’ it stated, adding that it would be ‘inappropriate to compare the success of drug policies in different countries’. Mr Clegg seized on a section which stated there was no clear relationship between stiff penalties and the number of addicts.","Deputy Prime Minister's office tried to persuade BBC to use campaigners .

"Walmart can now add banking to its 'everyday low price' slogan. The nation's largest retailer announced Wednesday that it will add to its shelves  low-cost mobile checking accounts managed and issued by Green Dot Bank to customers with simple eligibility requirements. It will be called GoBank. An official from the Green Dot Corporation, a prepaid-card specialist company in Pasadena, told MailOnline that with GoBank, members have full access and control of their money from participating Walmart locations, as well as their iPhone, iPod Touch, or Android device. This isn't Walmart's first attempt to break into the banking business. In 2005, Walmart officials applied for a banking license  but withdrew the application after being pressured by established banks opposing the company's efforts, CNN Money reports. GoBank: Walmart's new mobile banking system will be available with limited eligibility requirments . Walmart Senior Vice President Daniel Eckert said GoBank is an alternative to traditional banking . The accounts will include no minimum balance fees, overdraft charges or monthly fees to customers with a monthly direct deposit of $500 or more, according toThe New York Times. Steve Streit, founder and CEO of Green Dot Corporation and chairman of Green Dot Bank boasts of GoBank that no other checking account offers easy and affordable management of finances like the banking system will. 'GoBank is breaking down the barriers to traditional banking and brings the benefits of a FDIC-insured checking account that's loaded with features to a large segment of Americans,' Streit said in a statement. The Times reports that the banking system, including a MasterCard debit card and checking account, will provide accounts to almost anyone over the age of 18 who passes an identification check. The company will not use credit ratings or other eligibility determining scores for its customers. Daniel Eckert, senior vice president at Walmart, told the Times Tuesday that GoBank is intended to be a 'low cost alternative' to traditional banking. The accounts will be available by the end of October. According to CNN, the accounts will be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation who is involved with nearly all of the nation's banks. Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, has made many attempts at breaking into the banking business . According to CNN, the accounts will be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation who is involved with nearly all of the nation's banks. GoBank will boast features like 'Money Vault' which will enable customer's checking accounts to act as savings accounts by allowing the customer to move money in and out of a 'money vault' for 'safekeeping' at any time. The system will also allow customers to send money instantly via email or text message at no charge as well as receive direct deposit paychecks earlier than their usual pay date. The system's starter kit will be offered for $2.95. Eckert told the Times that most people receiving social security or fixed pensions would qualify for GoBank. 'Walmart customers want easier ways to manage their everyday finances and increasingly feel they just aren't getting value from traditional banking because of high fees,' Eckert said.","Walmart will offer a  low-cost mobile checking account system issued by Green Dot Bank to almost anyone over the age of 18 who passes an ID check .

"Russia today accused the West of pushing Ukraine into a 'fratricidal war' and repeated Moscow's calls for an end to the interim Ukrainian government's military action against pro-Kremlin separatists. The remarks from Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, were in line with frequent Russian statements placing blame on the United States and EU for the turmoil in Ukraine, where government forces killed dozens of rebels in the eastern Donetsk province on Monday and Tuesday. 'The people (of Ukraine) are in essence . being pushed into the abyss of fratricidal [conflict within a single . organisation] war,' Russian news agencies quoted Lavrov as saying at a . ministry reception attended by the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, . Patriarch Kirill. But he was robustly countered by Ukraine's president-elect who vowed that his tough crackdown would flush out the separatists. 'We will no longer let these terrorists kidnap people and kill them,' Petro Poroshenko told a German newspaper. Unrest: Miners take part in a rally against the actions of the Ukrainian military in Donetsk, which killed at least 36 people when retaking the airport from pro-Russian fighters . 'Fratricidal war': The protests come as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of pushing the country into a civil conflict . 'We will end this terror. There is a real war being waged against our country.' Poroshenko . insisted he was not formally giving orders ahead of his inauguration, . but that he was in close contact with the government and aims to see . pro-Russian insurgent leaders captured and put on trial. 'I can tell you that the operation has at last really begun,' he said. Lavrov did not name any nation but made . clear he was blaming the West, saying Ukraine's crisis was caused by . 'efforts to use the country not as a unifying link between different . parts of the Eurasian space, which is its absolutely natural role, but . as a watershed between the west and east of the European continent'. Former . Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich's abrupt decision to shun a . proffered free trade and economic support package from the European . Union in November sparked protests that led to his ouster in February. Russia . then annexed the Crimea region and pro-Russian separatists seized . buildings in several eastern cities, leading to a confrontation with the . interim government and aggravating the worst rift between Moscow and . the West since the Cold War. Up in arms: Miners gather in Lenin square in Donetsk to protest the offensive by Kiev in eastern Ukraine . Rising tension: An armed guard of Denis Pushilin protects the PM of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in Lenin square, Donetsk . Interfax quoted Lavrov as saying Sunday's presidential election, won by confectionery magnate Poroshenko, 'should help foster an end to the punitive operation' - Russia's term for the government operation in eastern Ukraine. Lavrov said anyone who accuses Russia of imperialism - after it annexed Crimea, where ethnic Russians are in the majority - is mistaken. 'The concept of a Russian world that is advanced by the Russian state and the Russian Orthodox Church has nothing to do with imperial schemes. 'It is about preserving spiritual and cultural ties between people,' Interfax quoted him as saying. Meanwhile the Danish government has said armed separatists in the east of Ukraine are holding a team of four OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) observers. The group was on patrol in Donetsk when contact was lost, according to the Danish government. The other monitors are from Turkey, Switzerland and Estonia. Separately, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov sought to play down claims that he sent soldiers to help pro-Russian activists. 'Ukrainian sources are putting out statements that some 'Chechen units' from Russia have made incursions into Donetsk,' Kadyrov wrote on Instagram, referring to the eastern Ukrainian city where pro-Russian rebels have declared a 'people's republic'. In mourning: A relative attends a funeral for Olga Prokhorenko who died when Ukrainian government forces shelled their location . Grief: Mourners attend the funeral for Olga Prokhorenko, 60, and Denis Abramenko, 30, who were killed in the offensive by Ukrainian forces . There were reported sightings of heavily armed Chechen fighters during attacks by pro-Russian rebels on Donetsk's airport this week. 'I officially declare that this does not correspond to the truth. There are no 'Chechen servicemen' or even 'military columns from Chechnya' in the conflict,' insisted the strongman leader. Russia's armed forces do not have separate Chechen units, Kadyrov said. 'Chechnya is one of the federal subjects of Russia and according to the Constitution does not have (its own) armed forces.' But he said that it was possible that some members of the large international Chechen diaspora could be fighting in the conflict. 'If someone sees a Chechen in the conflict zone, that is his personal affair,' Kadyrov wrote. Taking a stand: Demonstrators hold pictures of Maidan activists during clashes with the police during anti-government protests in Kiev last winter as they rally in front of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry . Moment of reflection: Protesters hold picture of a men who died in the Maidan movement clashes in Kiev last year during a rally in front of the Interior Ministry building in the capital . 'There are three million Chechens and around 2/3 of them live outside its borders, including in the West,' Kadyrov wrote. 'We cannot and do not need to know which of them are going where.' Kremlin-loyalist Kadyrov has acknowledged his role in freeing two journalists from pro-Kremlin Russian website Life News after they were detained by Ukrainian pro-government forces. 'Thanks again to you for help in freeing our journalists,' Putin told Kadyrov on Monday. Kadyrov called himself 'Putin's footsoldier' in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda daily on Sunday. CNN on Monday published a video where pro-Russian separatists said they came from Chechnya as volunteers and described themselves as 'Kadyrovists'. Kadyrov responded on Twitter on Tuesday: 'If there were real 'Kadyrovists' in Donetsk, the Ukrainian security forces would now be a pile of corpses.'","Sergei Lavrov repeats calls to end Ukrainian strikes on pro-Kremlin forces .

"For football fans, transfer deadline day can be the most-anticipated event of the year. It gives struggling clubs a chance to bolster their squad once last time - and teams at the opposite end of the table the opportunity to get even stronger. But they only have until 11pm on Monday to do so! Here, Sportsmail examines what questions will be answered once the clock strikes that very time. 1 - Will Arsene Wenger land a striker? With Olivier Giroud injured and Yaya Sanogo doing a weekly impression of Bambi on Ice, Arsenal are desperate for additional firepower. They missed out on Loic Remy, who signed for Chelsea on Sunday, and fellow target Alessio Cerci is set for Atletico Madrid. So, will Arsenal stump up Radamel Falcao’s £12million loan fee, does he have another name in mind or will he frustrate fans and stubbornly refuse to spend? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger discuss the possibility of signing a striker . Missed out: Loic Remy joined Chelsea instead of Arsenal but who will Arsene Wenger turn to next? 2 - Can Manchester City lure Falcao from Monaco? Arsenal might want Falcao but they are not alone. Manchester City would love to bring him to the Etihad and with Alvaro Negredo agreeing to join Valencia on loan they could avoid any financial fair play regulations. If City get Falcao they will surely be favourites to pip Chelsea to the title. Should I stay or should I go? Radamel Falcao is linked with joining both Arsenal and Manchester City . Loan: Alvaro Negredo joining Valencia would open up the door for Falcao according to Financial Fair Play rules . 3 - Which United flops will be shown the door? Javier Hernandez is off to Real Madrid and Shinji Kagawa has rejoined Borussia Dortmund but who else can Louis van Gaal shift? Danny Welbeck (Everton and Spurs), Tom Cleverley (Hull, Aston Villa and Valencia) and Anderson (is anyone desperate enough?) could yet leave. Leaving? Manchester United and England striker Danny Welbeck is on Everton and Tottenham's shortlists . Free to a good home: Tom Cleverley (left) and Anderson (right) could be on their way out of Manchester . 4 - Do Louis van Gaal and Ed Woodward have enough charm to save United’s squad? Apart from up front, United are desperate for reinforcements, despite the arrival of Daley Blind from Ajax. They need a right back and a centre back, and a tough-tackling midfielder would not go amiss. Sporting’s William Carvalho fits that bill, though don’t be surprised if there are no more big arrivals. You'll do nicely: William Carvalho fits the bill for what Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal needs . 5 - Will Petr Cech end his Chelsea career? He’s won three Premier League titles, the Champions League and a whole lot more, but is Petr Cech’s glove affair with Chelsea set to end? And if so, will he find a club in time? Paris Saint-Germain are very keen on him and Monaco have shown interest, too. Chelsea have one too many foreign players for their 25-man squad, so need to shift someone. The end? Goalkeeper Petr Cech could leave after becoming second-string to Thibaut Courtois at Chelsea . 6 - How many bodies can Neil Warnock get in at Palace? Tony Pulis left Palace because of disagreements over transfers. Warnock has just a few hours left to shore up his squad with Wigan midfielder James McArthur top of his list. Having played for him at Bury, Sheffield United, Leeds and QPR, it might be worth Paddy Kenny sitting by the phone, too. OK, maybe not. Thinking cap on: New Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock will keep his eyes open on transfer deadline day . 7 - Can Daniel Levy resist a deadline-day deal? It wouldn’t be deadline day without Tottenham trying to make dramatic late signings. Daniel Levy loves a bargain and is a shrewd negotiator. And after watching his side being dismantled by Liverpool, he might be persuaded to get more involved than before. Danny Welbeck is a target to come in while Sandro, Aaron Lennon and Vlad Chiriches could leave. Any bargains? It wouldn't be deadline day without Tottenham's Daniel Levy trying for dramatic late signings . 8 - Will Jermain Defoe play for Harry Redknapp again? He’s only been in Canada a few months and he’s out with a groin injury at the moment, but Jermain Defoe is hoping he can be reunited with Harry Redknapp. The QPR boss always gets the best out of the former England striker and they need a replacement for Loic Remy. Together again? Jermain Defoe may rejoin Harry Redknapp at QPR as a replacement for striker Remy . 9 - Does Micah Richards want first-team football? Nine Premier League appearances in the past two seasons is not something Richards will be proud of. So will he follow Jack Rodwell’s path and leave Manchester City for Sunderland? He is only 26 and needs to prove that he is hungry to play again. Fancy first-team football, Micah? Richards could follow Jack Rodwell from Manchester City to Sunderland . 10 - Who will win the race for Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk? With a cool name like Virgil, you can see why so many clubs want Van Dijk. Celtic are insistent that he is going nowhere but Southampton are determined to seal an £8m deal. If they don’t, Newcastle and Sunderland are also interested. After conceding six against Chelsea, maybe Everton should be, too. En route? Virgil van Dijk is wanted by Southampton on an £8m deal but Celtic insist he's going nowhere .","Will Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger land an all-important striker in time?

"The nurse who apparently took her own life following the royal hoax call scandal was found hanged in her staff housing, it has been claimed. Mother-of-two Jacintha Saldanha, 46, left a note for her family, it was revealed yesterday. She had not told her husband or children that she was involved in the incident, meaning the letter may provide their only clue to what prompted the respected nurse to take such a drastic and tragic step. Scroll down for videos . Condolences: Flowers and personal messages . (right) are pictured outside the King Edward VII Hospital apartments . where Jacintha Saldanha (left) was found dead in central London last . week . Tragic: Benedict Barboza (centre), 49, the husband of Jacintha Saldanha (centre, photo), is pictured with his children Lisha (left), 14, and Junal (right), 16, in Westminster ahead of a meeting with Labour MP Keith Vaz . Prime Minister David Cameron said today that ‘many lessons’ must be learned from the tragedy. He told MPs: ‘She clearly loved her . job, loved her work, cared deeply about the health of her patients and . what has happened is a complete tragedy. There will be many lessons that . need to be learned.’ A post-mortem examination was held . yesterday on the body of Mrs Saldanha, who was the first unwitting . member of staff at the King Edward VII Hospital in London, where the . Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for acute morning sickness, to . take the call made by two Australian DJs pretending to be the Queen and . Prince Charles. She passed them on to a second nurse on Kate's ward, who was then duped into giving out details of her medical condition . The results of the post-mortem . examination are not yet known, and an inquest is due to be opened and adjourned tomorrow. Family spokesman, Labour MP Keith Vaz, said yesterday Mrs . Saldanha's family were demanding answers from the hospital about the . circumstances that led to her death. Together: Ms Jacintha's husband Barboza (centre) and her children Lisha and Junal (pictured here with Labour MP Keith Vaz (right), had no idea the nurse had received the hoax phone call . Although bosses at the hospital in . Marylebone have said they will conduct internal inquiries, the nurse's . family – husband Ben Barboza, 49, and children Junal, 17, and Lisha, 14 – . 'want to know everything'. Mr Vaz, who has met hospital chairman . Lord Glenarthur to demand a full inquiry, said: 'What the chairman of . the hospital said to me was that there are inquiries going on in the . hospital. The family of Jacintha Saldanha is to receive more than £300,000 from a memorial fund. The nurse's husband and teenage children will be donated money generated from the advertising profits of Sydney station 2Day FM, whose presenters were behind the prank call. In way of reparations, Southern Cross Austereo (SCA), the parent company of 2Day FM, said it would establish a memorial fund to benefit the nurse's family. The company said a minimum contribution of around £320,000 would be made. Rhys Holleran, SCA's chief executive, said: 'We are very sorry for what has happened. It is a terrible tragedy and our thoughts continue to be with the family. 'We hope that by contributing to a memorial fund we can help to provide the Saldanha family with the support they need at this very difficult time. 'The company today reiterates that it is deeply saddened by this tragic and unforeseen event and offers its condolences to the family of Jacintha Saldanha.' SCA has also cancelled the station's Christmas party, planned for later this week, as it would be 'inappropriate' to go ahead with the event for Sydney staff, said a spokeswoman. 'That is not sufficient for the family. There are unexplained . circumstances. The family want to know everything. All the facts, fully . and clearly.' Mr Vaz added: 'The hospital needs to . be more pro-active, a full inquiry is needed and the family need to be . included in that. 'They are a lovely close-knit family, a Catholic family . who will be spending their first Christmas without their mother, and . for Ben, without his wife.' Mr Vaz has also written to Rhys Holleran, chief executive of the radio station's owner Southern Cross Austereo, claiming that his company has yet to make any direct contact with Ms Saldanha's family. The MP, who is chairman of the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, conceded there had been a public apology for the incident and its consequences through the media. But he wrote: ‘I am concerned and disappointed that Southern Cross Austereo appears to have not taken any steps to assist the family. ‘There has been no written apology, no request for a meeting with the family and no attempt to travel to the United Kingdom to express contrition.’ Mr Barboza, an NHS accountant, and his . children live in Bristol. Mrs Saldanha, whose body was found in the . hospital's staff accommodation she used during the week, returned to the . family home at weekends. She had been expected home as usual . last Friday when police broke the news of her death. Mr Vaz said: 'They . [the family] were in the dark about the hoax call. They hadn't watched . the news or seen anything about it. They didn't know they were involved . until after Jacintha's death.' Bosses at the Australian radio . station, 2Day FM, have also been under pressure to explain why they gave . the go-ahead for the prank. The company which owns the station, . Southern Cross Austereo, yesterday cancelled its staff Christmas party . and said it would donate the rest of the year's advertising revenue – . some £320,000 – to a memorial fund set up in Mrs Saldanha's name by the . hospital. Difficult time: In a BBC interview, Mr Vaz (centre) said Mr Barboza (left) - along with Lisha and Junal (right) - had been left 'shocked and bewildered' after Mrs Saldanha was found dead at nurses' housing on Friday morning . Emotional: Mr Vaz (centre, red scarf) hugs Mr Barboza (centre, wearing glasses) and his two children - Lisha  and Junal (faces not pictured) in Westminster . Action: Prime Minister David Cameron (left, pictured in Cambridge) called the death 'an absolute tragedy'; and Mr Vaz (right, pictured last week) said the hospital must provide more support to the family . Saddened: Sydney-based 2DayFM radio presenters Michael Christian (left) and Mel Greig (right in left, and right) made a grovelling apology in two interviews aired on Australian TV yesterday (one seen right) Chief executive Rhys Holleran said: . 'We hope ... we can help to provide the Saldanha family with the . support they need at this very difficult time.' The hospital said it would 'welcome' the gesture. Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday described Mrs Saldanha's death as 'an absolute tragedy'. He said: 'I feel incredibly sorry for . her and her family. It is an absolute tragedy that this has happened and . I am sure everyone will want to reflect on how it was allowed to . happen.' A St James's Palace spokesman stressed . it did not complain about the hoax call, saying: 'On the contrary, we . offered our full and heartfelt support to the nurses and hospital . staff.'

The call had damaging and long-lasting effects – according to Mr Sachs, it destroyed his relationship with his granddaughter.

"Andrea Faustini may be a finalist in X-Factor but his own family have claimed he has no hope of winning the competition - because the British public are too nationalistic to vote for an Italian. Speaking from the family home in the suburbs of Rome, the talented singer’s father, Adolfo Faustini, said he is already preparing for the worst because '[the English] won't vote for a foreigner'. In this Saturday’s final Andrea faces stiff competition from homegrown talent Fleur and Ben, who have been garnering local support this week as their tour the UK on their Battle Buses. Meanwhile Andrea’s friends and extended family back in Rome can’t watch the show or vote using the phone lines. Mr Faustini, who works for the bank Unicredit, admitted to Mail Online he was preparing for the worst, as he opened up the family album to reveal a cherubic Andrea. ‘I don't think that he will win. He is fantastic. But at the end of the day the English will vote for someone English when it comes to the final. They won't vote for a foreigner. They are too nationalistic.' Scroll down for video . Make-do microphone: Two-year-old Andrea Faustini  was quiet and reserved as a toddler, pictured left singing into his foot, but startled his family with his singing voice, which has seen him make the final three in X-Factor (right) Angelic in voice and looks: Baby Andrea 'loved to eat', according to his father, and even before he could walk was developing the unusual dress sense he has demonstrated in X-Factor, such as this jolly Yogi Bear top . Belting it out: Even at the age of three Andrea, pictured above, was singing with incredible maturity and was admired as a cute toddler . Rocking the cradle: Andrea aged one month old, pictured above with his older sister Eleanor then aged eight, who was more gregarious than her brother growing up but he stole the show when he started singing . But if his father's predictions are proved right and his singing career then fails to take off, Andrea already has a 'plan B' - moving into business in China. Adolfo said: 'Here in Italy there is no work for young people. We have always known that our two children will have to go away and work abroad.That's why Andrea is studying Chinese.' 'If he doesn't have a musical career he will first study and then go and work in China, that was the plan. He understands something of business.' Who do you want to win X Factor 2014? Who do you want to win X Factor 2014? Now share your opinion . And like every proud family, Adolfo and his sister, Andrea's aunt, can't resist adding one or two facts about the star that will no doubt make the singer cringe - he loved playing with Spice Girl dolls almost as much as eating. The finalist - dubbed 'teddy bear' by former Spice Girl mentor Mel B - has faced criticism over his weight been forced to deny reports that he has been put on a diet by X-Factor producers. He was reportedly given a ‘biscuit ban’ and ordered to eat healthily. Aunt Anna Faustini, who runs a restaurant on the coast near Rome, says: 'Andrea loves to eat. He is very quiet. His sister is a comedian by contrast. He is always happy and quiet. When he goes on the stage he sings but when he is not on the stage he is quite quiet. He doesn't talk that much round the table. He eats!' Father Adolfo adds: 'He and Elena always played with her Spice Girls dolls. She was more keen on them than him obviously but they also had a video of the Spice Girls which they both loved and would watch it all the time and dance to it. In this way they learnt all the words to the songs.' Bursting with pride at his son's achievements, Adolfo proudly shows off pictures of Andrea as baby - already showing his unique dress sense with a Yogi Bear jumper. The tot-sized Andrea is already showing signs of a fondness for his food, as demonstrated by his beautiful chubby cheeks. 'Deserves to win': Andrea is unlikely to win X-Factor according to his father, because the British 'won't vote for a foreigner' Stunning voice: Andrea's father Adolfo says that his son 'loves to eat' and will move to China and work in business if his singing career doesn't take off . ‘Italian teddy bear’: Andrea, pictured here as a teenager, as reportedly been given a ‘biscuit ban’ and ordered to eat healthily on X-Factor . Proud father: Andrea's father Adolfo, pictured above with a picture of his son aged two, says his son deserves to win X-Factor but will not do so because of his nationality . His aunt Anna Faustini and uncle Luciano, who run a seafood restaurant La Murena on the coast near Rome, said he has always loved his food. ‘The whole family come to our restaurant all the time. And they come to our house for Christmas. But Andrea doesn’t talk as much as the rest of the family. He’s quite quiet really when he’s not singing. He just eats.’ His favourite dishes are risotto with cream and langoustines made by his uncle, followed by Fruits of the forest marmalade pie made by his aunt Anna. ‘He doesn’t eat the whole thing but he generally has enough for two people’, she said. Anna, who is flying over for to watch the final on Saturday with other family members, shares her brother Adolfo’s worries. She said: ‘He won’t win, it’s true. He was the favourite all the way along but now even the bookies are saying that he won’t get the votes. ‘If you’re British and given the choice to vote Andrea or for Ben or Fleur, who are both British, who are you going to choose? ‘ . With the final just around the corner, the finalists have been pulling out all the stops to whip up the maximum amount of support. But while his counterparts headed back to their hometowns, Andrea’s tour bus did not get to do a homecoming concert in Rome. He toured London instead, stopping off at San Carlo Cicchetti restaurant in St James to meet Italian TV chef Aldo Zilli and at Leicester Square, where producers had laid on an Italian themed event. 'He loves to eat!': Anna Faustini and Luciano di Girolamo, Andrea's aunt and uncle, own a restaurant on the coast near Rome and bake his favourite cake, a frutti di bosco tart . Learning Chinese: Andrea is studying Chinese and Korean in preparation for a future business career if his singing does not take off after X-Factor . Dressed in a sharp black tuxedo, he performed at the Royal Albert Hall for the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research’s Christmas With The Stars introduced by his mentor Mel B. His family believe that decision to remain in London for his ‘homecoming’ was taken ‘because people in Italy cannot vote’ in the English competition, ‘and because it’s too far to come of course. It would take forever,’ Aunt Anna explains. If rejected by the British public it will be heartbreaking for Andrea because he turned down Italian X-Factor this year in favour of the British show - because he loves British music, his dad says. ‘If he chose 20 favourite songs 19 would be in English’. Andrea to win: Andrea did his 'homecoming' tour in London, instead of his native Rome, because Italians can't vote in the competition . Emotional: Teary X-factor finalist, Andrea Faustini, spending some quality Christmas time in London with his family . All smiles: Andrea addresses the small crowd of fans in London as his bids for a final push of support ahead of the X-factor final . His CD collection at home includes British star Adele as well as Americans such as Katy Perry and Mariah Carey. When he was growing up he and his sister Elena would watch the Spice Girls DVD over and over, doing the dance moves and learning the words to all the songs, he remembers. ‘They had the Spice Girls dolls too, as everyone now knows.’ Even if he does win. Andrea already has experienced the high of a music competition and found that it doesn’t always make all your dreams come true, his dad explains. ‘He has already been through it once on Ti Lascio una Canzone [The Italian talent TV show Andrea performed in aged 14. ‘He did very well in that but it didn’t change anything . Afterwards life went back to normal.’ But if Britain doesn’t prove the Faustinis wrong by voting for Andrea he may have to leave them far behind. His father says if he doesn’t make a music career for himself, he will have to move to China. ‘We will miss him. But we miss him even in London. ‘ .","Andrea Faustini is in final three for X-Factor but father says he won't win .

"Victim: Islan Nettles, 21, slipped into a coma after being attacked on Thursday. She died five days later . A transgender woman in New York has died after being beaten by a group of men who attacked her and yelled gay slurs. The victim, 21-year-old Islan Nettles, died Thursday in a Harlem hospital when she was taken off life support five days following the attack. The attacker, a 20-year-old man named Paris Wilson, was arrested for assault but now that the victim has died he may face murder charges. The attack on Nettles was the latest in a spate of bias incidents this year in New York and a total of 68 have been reported so far this year, showing a significant increase from the 54 that were reported in all of last year. Nettles and a friend, another transgender woman, were out Saturday evening in Harlem when they ran into a group of men and one pounced, punching Nettles in the face, police said. The New York Post reports that the attack took place after Wilson began flirting with Nettles, before he realized she was transgendered. Once that became clear, his friends started teasing him and he proceeded to attack her. Hate crime: A witness told police that the attackers yelled gay slurs at Nettles, who was walking down a street in Harlem with other transgender women . After the attack, Nettles was hospitalized, slipped into a coma and later died. The . witness eventually told detectives about the anti-gay remarks- after . initially leaving them out of the criminal report- and the hate crimes . task force took over the investigation. Detectives are looking whether the suspect had propositioned Nettles. Upgraded charges are possible following the medical examiner's ruling, police said. Nettle's sister, Elana, said in an interview Friday that she and her mother were coping well so far but did not comment further. The bias attacks this year range from yelled slurs to the May killing of a 32-year-old gay man in Greenwich Village. Police stepped up patrols this summer in response. In May, police said Mark Carson, 32, was first taunted with homophobic slurs, then shot in the head in Greenwich Village, not far from the site of 1969 riots that helped give rise to the gay rights movement. A suspect was arrested on a charge of murder as a hate crime. The killing, and other bias attacks, sparked a summer protest attended by thousands. Too late: Nettles was in a coma at Harlem Hospital for five days before she died on Thursday . Some of the other bias incidents this summer included an assault last week where two men were attacked in Chelsea. Christine Quinn, the city's first openly gay City Council speaker and a mayoral candidate, denounced the most recent attack. 'An attack against one person, or one community, is an assault against all New Yorkers,' she said in a joint statement with other council members. 'We ask all New Yorkers to come together, to embrace our differences and to denounce hate violence.'","A man named Paris Wilson started flirting with a woman in Harlem and then found out shew as transgender .

"Tamoxifen, which costs just 6p a day, reduces the risk of the illness by more than a third and researchers say doctors should give women the pills as freely as statins . Doctors should give women pills to prevent breast cancer as freely as statins, researchers say. Tamoxifen, which costs just 6p a day, reduces the risk of the illness by more than a third, a major study has found. Furthermore, the preventative effect lasted for 20 years after a woman stopped taking the pill and was expected still to be working 30 years later or more. British researchers said if GPs routinely prescribed Tamoxifen to the half a million women at high risk of breast cancer, as many as 3,000 cases a year would be prevented. The pills are available on the NHS but fewer than 1,000 women are taking them to prevent breast cancer, partly because family doctors are unaware of the benefits. Around one in eight women will develop breast cancer in Britain and there are 50,000 cases a year. Women are deemed to be high risk if their likelihood of getting the illness is greater than 17 per cent – most often due to a family history of the disease. A study of 7,154 high-risk women found those given Tamoxifen daily for a five-year period in the 1990s were 38 per cent less likely to have developed breast cancer. Researchers checking up on the women found that even though some stopped taking the drugs 20 years ago, they were still protected. And the team expect the effect will still be working in 30 years. Lead researcher Jack Cuzick, a professor at Queen Mary, the University of London, said that the drugs should be as widely prescribed as statins are to protect against heart disease. ‘There’s a major cultural shift which the profession needs to embrace,’ he said. ‘There’s a fatalism about cancer, there’s a feeling there’s nothing you can do about it very much. We have very clear evidence we can do something. ‘What’s new and exciting about this is that even though Tamoxifen was stopped after five years, benefits continued unabated after 20 years.’ He said many women were unaware they were at high risk. To address this, he said, they should take risk assessments – a short questionnaire – at the time of their first mammogram, aged 47 to 50. The pills are available on the NHS but fewer than 1,000 women are taking them partly because family doctors are unaware of the benefits . Professor Cuzick presented his study at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium conference in Texas, and it is also published in the Lancet Oncology medical journal. Surprisingly, while it showed that Tamoxifen prevented the cancer occurring, the pill did not appear to reduce the total risk of dying from the illness. Professor Cuzick believes that it is still too early for this to be apparent. The study is still running, and he suspects that in a few years it will be clear that Tamoxifen also prevents deaths from cancer. Last year the NHS rationing body NICE recommended that GPs prescribe Tamoxifen to women at high risk. But bizarrely it has not been licensed as safe by another watchdog – the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency – so many doctors are unwilling. The drug works by blocking the hormone oestrogen from reaching potentially cancerous cells, which can cause them to divide. But it has unpleasant side effects, including many menopause-like symptoms such as hot flushes, sweats, nausea, muscle ache and weight gain. There is also a small risk of endometrial cancer, a rare form of cancer in the womb lining. Professor Anthony Howell, a cancer specialist at the University of Manchester, said: ‘Identifying all high-risk women and offering them Tamoxifen could potentially prevent up to 3,000 cases of breast cancer a year. ‘A large proportion do not know they are at increased risk.If these women were to take Tamoxifen, it could prevent thousands getting breast cancer in the first place.’","British researchers said prescribing Tamoxifen reduces illness by a third .

"First, she suffered the indignity of being hugged by a sweaty LeBron James during a charity basketball match. Now, a video has emerged of the Duchess of Cambridge rolling her eyes after being exhorted to 'keep wrapping' during a visit to a children's centre in New York. In the short clip, the Duchess, who is busily wrapping a gift, is seen being tapped on the shoulder by a well-wisher. Scroll down for video . One is not amused! The Duchess delivers an eye roll following the intervention from the well wisher . As she looks round and smiles, Kate is told to 'keep wrapping' by the anonymous passer-by and quickly turns back to the job at hand - but not before rolling her eyes in irritation. The incident occurred during a visit to the Northside Center for Child Development in the deprived Harlem district of New York . Joined by a group of local grandmothers, the Duchess was helping to wrap presents destined for some of the city's poorest children. Despite the rude interruption, the Duchess appeared to enjoy the experience, with one local telling MailOnline that she and Kate had spent the time 'chatting like old friends'. Cheerful: The video begins with Kate happily wrapping presents in the Harlem children's centre . Intervention: The well-wisher appears behind her and exhorts her to 'keep wrapping' Not happy: A clearly displeased Duchess of Cambridge rolls her eyes in consternation as she looks away . Mary Dawkins, 71, a grandmother of six from Harlem, also joined forces to hold down the paper covering a doll, and stick the wrapping in place. Afterwards, Mrs Dawkins said: 'We sat together wrapping gifts - she's my girl. She said she has to wrap gifts when she gets home.' Kate's display of irritation was a rarity - the Duchess is not known for her temper or, indeed, making any sort of fuss. But while the Duchess of Cambridge is rarely ruffled by the actions of well wishers or the media, the same cannot be said for other members of the royal family. In 2004, Prince Harry became involved in a scuffle with photographers outside a nightclub after they attempted to take pictures of him and his friends leaving the venue. The royal was accused of similar behaviour three years later, this time in a bid to prevent photos of him and then-girlfriend Chelsy Davy being taken. All smiles: Prior to the incident, the Duchess had been helping grandmother Mary Dawkins to wrap presents . Concentration: The Duchess managed to wrap several gifts during her visit to the children's centre . Old friends: Mrs Dawkins said she and the Duchess had chatted like 'old friends' during the encounter . Helping out: The visit was part of the royal tour of New York which ended on Tuesday night . Prince Charles, who in 2005 revealed that he hates 'facing the media', has also been known to lash out, famously branding BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell 'awful' and claiming he couldn't 'bear that man'. Most famously irascible of all though, is the Duke of Edinburgh - a man not known for keeping his opinions, however sharp, to himself. Speaking to the matron of a Caribbean hospital during a 1966 visit, he made his thoughts on the Press plain. 'You have mosquitoes,' he quipped. 'I have the Press!' Indignity: Later the same day, Kate suffered the indignity of being hugged by a sweaty basketball player . Pro: The Duchess wasn't in the least put out by the second incident and allowed Mr James to hug her .","A video of the Duchess of Cambridge rolling her eyes has emerged .

"Days after the UK finally withdrew its troops from one conflict zone, it is preparing to send servicemen back to another. The last British soldiers pulled out of Afghanistan a fortnight ago but officers are set to head to Iraq in order to help prevent yet more territory falling into the hands of Islamic State terrorists. British training teams will be sent to the semi-autonomous Kurdish zone of Iraq to help US forces reclaim territory in the north and west of the country that fell to Islamic State earlier in the year. Days after the UK finally withdrew its troops from Afghanistan (pictured) it is preparing to send servicemen back to another - this time, Iraq . The dramatic move will be the first British mission to Iraq since it pulled all its forces out of the country in 2011 – eight years after the mission that vanquished Saddam Hussein. ‘If Iraq fails or the government becomes sectarian then that is a massive problem’, a Whitehall spokesman told The Times. ‘If we are serious then we have got to stop [it] failing. If we can stabilise Iraq then we have got a hard shoulder to start putting the squeeze back on Syria. If we lose Iraq then we are doomed.’ Large swathes of Iraq are already controlled by Islamic State extremists and the US-led mission is to help the new prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, stabilise his country. British training teams will be sent to the semi-autonomous Kurdish zone of Iraq to help US forces reclaim territory in the north and west of the country that fell to Islamic State (pictured) earlier in the year . The US has already agreed to send about 500 soldiers from the 1st Infantry Division to Iraq and elsewhere in the region, with the aim of retraining the Iraqi army, which crumbled when attacked by IS in the summer. Britain has so far only sanctioned a two-week training course on heavy machineguns in Arbil, involving 12 soldiers from 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment. The British Government pledged in August that it would not send ‘boots on the ground’ to deal with the Iraq crisis, but deployed 150 special forces troops after Prime Minister David Cameron warned that the situation may require ‘military action to go after the terrorists’. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the mission had escalated beyond a humanitarian one and could last for months, and said that the Islamist fanatics of IS had to be stopped before they became strong enough to launch attacks on British soil. General John Allen, President Obama’s special envoy for the anti-Isis coalition, indicated in London last month that he was hopeful Britain would participate in the US training programme for the Iraq forces.","Training teams will be sent to semi-autonomous Kurdish zone of Iraq .

"Oblivious to the cold - and predators - as night falls, an orphaned elephant calf holds a vigil by the body of his dead mother. The five-month-old lovingly laid his trunk on her as the emotional drama was played out in Samburu, northern Kenya. Worried for his safety, keepers from the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), Kenya Wildlife Service and Save the Elephants worked through the night to capture the bull - who stubbornly refused to leave his mother's side. Scroll down for video . The baby elephant was discovered holding a vigil for his dead mother in Samburu, north Kenya . Such was the five-month-old's devotion, he was oblivious to the cold, and threat of predators . An autopsy later revealed that the mother elephant died due to a serious internal infection caused by a twisted gut. The youngster is seen above keeping watch over her body before night fell . Vets were eventually able to tranquilise the youngster in the early hours of the morning, before driving him to the Samburu airstrip. A specialist team flew in to prepare the calf for the flight to his new home at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust Elephant Orphanage. Located in the Nairobi National Park, the nursery is the only one of its kind in Kenya and receives elephants from across the country. After the flight, the severely dehydrated calf was driven to the orphanage, where keepers quenched his thirst with some milk and water. Some of the other 30 orphans at the nursery were bought in to welcome and comfort the new arrival, who was named Sokotei. And despite the shock of his new surroundings, it wasn't long before the grieving calf was making new friends. 'Sokotei's rescue was a battle against time to keep him safe. Throughout the night, teams from Save the Elephants and the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust were there to support the young calf and everyone had a long night battling to keep him safe from predators by trying to catch him,' DSWT director Rob Brandford said. Worried for his safety, keepers from the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), Kenya Wildlife Service and Save the Elephants worked through the night to capture the bull .

A specialist team flew in to prepare the calf for the flight to his new home at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust Elephant Orphanage . After the flight, the severely dehydrated calf was driven to the orphanage, where keepers quenched his thirst with some milk and water . 'Alone, he was extremely vulnerable, but rain and the fact that he's a wild animal meant we had to wait until morning, when everyone woke very early and ready to face a dramatic few hours.' The rescue was part of the DSWT's 'Orphans Project', which rescues and reintegrates elephants into the wild. The orphanage looks after elephants under the age of three that are still 'milk dependent'. They are then sent to one of two reintegration centres in the Tsavo National Park - one in Voi and the other in Ithumba. The rescue was part of the DSWT's 'Orphans Project', which rescues and reintegrates elephants into the wild. The youngster was given the name Sokotei by keepers . The orphanage looks after elephants under the age of three that are still 'milk dependent' 'Once Sokotei is old enough to go to one of our reintegration centres, he will spend time going out into the bush to meet other herds, learn what food is safe and essentially learn how to be a wild elephant,' Brandford added. 'It can be a long process, it depends what age the orphan was rescued. If they were very young and have no memory of living wild, then it can take seven to eight years before they are in a position to survive in the wild.' Last year, almost 50 elephants were rescued by the Trust, with the numbers rising each year as the threat of poaching increases, meaning more calves are left orphaned. An autopsy later revealed that Sokotei's mother, an elephant known as Cherie, died due to a serious internal infection caused by a twisted gut. 'Once Sokotei is old enough to go to one of our reintegration centres, he will spend time going out into the bush to meet other herds, learn what food is safe and essentially learn how to be a wild elephant,' DSWT director Rob Brandford said .","Emotional scene in Samburu, northern Kenya, as five-month-old held vigil .

"Older women never tire of hearing the tick-tock of the biological clock which is supposed to ruin their chances of having a healthy baby, but a new study reveals babies born to mothers aged over 40 can have better physical and emotional well-being. And with a host of celebrities giving birth in their forties, researchers from Birkbeck University of London and University College London have highlighted a growing trend in their study on older mothers. Singer Gwen Stefani, 44, gave birth to a baby boy called Apollo Bowie Flynn Rossdale in February this year, while actress Halle Berry, 47, gave birth to her latest child Maceo last year. Researchers from from Birkbeck University of London and University College London assessed children of women older than 40, like singer Gwen Stefani who had her third child at 43, and compared them with those born to younger mothers in their twenties . Uma Thurman meanwhile didn't plan on having any more children after the two children she had with ex-husband Ethan Hawke, until she met new man Arpas Busson. They welcomed their daughter Luna into the world when the actress was 42. Researchers assessed children of women older than 40 and compared them with those born to younger mothers in their twenties. While they might tire their mothers out and be harder to catch – the research suggests children born to mothers over 40 are healthier. The study revealed mothers who give birth over the age of 40 were less likely to have sickly children. Halle Berry, 47, gave birth to her latest child Maceo last year . The study concluded that children of older mothers were 22 percent less likely to accidentally injure themselves and nearly a third less likely to be admitted to hospital by the age of three. The offspring of older women are also more likely to have better emotional well-being as the likelihood of conflict between parent and child was found to decrease as the maternal age increased. And language development by the ages of three and four was also better for the children of older mothers. The number of women over the age of 40 having a baby has increased more than fourfold in the last 30 years, figures from the Office of National Statistics show. In 1982 there were 6,519 live births in England and Wales to women aged 40 or more, about 1 percent of all babies born that year. By 2012 the figure had risen to 29,994, or 4.1% of all live births. Actress Uma Thurman welcomed baby Luna into the world when she was 42. The average age of mothers in England Wales has reached an all time high of 30 . And the average age of mothers having babies has now reached 30 – the highest ever recorded. Professor Jacqueline Barnes, one of the study leaders, of Birkbeck, said the project was based on the fact that the maternal age was rising. She said: ‘It has demonstrated that, while there are many medical reasons why close attention should be given to the physical well-being of older mothers and their infants both during pregnancy and immediately after birth, an increase in older motherhood should not necessarily be a cause for concern in relation to subsequent parenting. ‘Indeed, it is likely that older mothers will be preparing their children well for preschool and then school experiences in a warm and responsive home environment. ‘The findings of fewer unintentional injuries and fewer socio-emotional problems with increasing maternal age may suggest that women with more life experiences are able to draw upon a wider range of support that can help to reduce some of the stress of parenting.’","Researchers from Birkbeck University of London and University College London found kids of older mums were less likely to injure themselves .

"Ivory poachers have killed one of Africa’s most iconic and well-loved tusker elephants. Satao, whose tusks were so long they trailed the ground, was discovered with his face hacked off at Kenya’s Tsavo East National Park. The behemoth animal had roamed the park for at least 45 years. It is believed he was killed with a single poisoned arrow. Ivory poachers have killed one of Africa¿s most iconic and well-loved tusker elephants, Satao . The Tsavo Trust had been monitoring the elephant's movements using aerial reconnaissance for the last 18 months, and thanks to his enormous tucks the beast was ‘easily identifiable’ from the air. But the technology was not enough to save the iconic beast from the hands of the poachers. A spokesman said: 'With great sadness, we report the death of Satao, one of Tsavo’s most iconic and well-loved tuskers. 'This magnificent elephant was widely known in Tsavo East National Park, where he was observed with awe by many thousands of Tsavo’s visitors over the years. 'No longer will Tsavo and Kenya benefit from his mighty presence.' Satao, whose tusks were so long they trailed the ground, was discovered with his face hacked off at Kenya's Tsavo East National Park . They . added: 'The arrow had entered his left flank and he stood no chance of . survival. We spotted his carcass on 2nd June but to avoid any potential . false alarms, we first took pains to verify the carcass really was his. 'Today it is with enormous regret that we confirm there is no doubt that Satao is dead, killed by an ivory poacher’s poisoned arrow to feed the seemingly insatiable demand for ivory in far off countries. 'A great life lost so that someone far away can have a trinket on their mantelpiece.' It comes after authorities announced that  one of Africa's oldest national parks is under attack 'from all fronts,' after 68 elephants have been slaughtered in two months by poachers, some of whom shot them from helicopters. The Tsavo Trust had been monitoring the elephant's movements using aerial reconnaissance. But the technology was not enough to save the iconic beast from the hands of the poachers . Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo is under constant assault by renegade Congolese soldiers, gunmen from South Sudan and others. International wildlife regulators say 20,000 elephants were killed in Africa alone in 2013. The Johannesburg-based African Parks group, which manages Garamba, said since mid-April, the 5,000-square kilometer (1,900-square mile) park has faced an onslaught from several bands of poachers who have already killed 4 percent of its elephants. About 28 percent of Africa's elephants are in eastern Africa, but most of them - close to 55 percent - are in southern Africa. Some populations of elephants continue to face an immediate threat of local extinction.","Satao had roamed Kenya's Tsavo East National Park for at least 45 years .

"The elephant that inspired the Save The Elephants charity has been found dead after poachers ripped his tusks from his skull. Mountain Bull, a 46-year-old African elephant, was found in Mount Kenya forest last week after his GPS tracker installed by conservationists stalled. He is thought to have been dead for eight days. Tragic: Mountain Bull, the 46-year-old creature that inspired Save The Elephants, has been found dead . The six-tonne elephant became the face of the Save The Elephants campaign in October 2012. Prone to ploughing down anything from huge trees to man-made barriers, he had been attracting the attention of poachers for years. In a desperate bid to protect the magnificent creature, conservationists gave Mountain Bull a tracking device to identify his natural migration path. They then built a 'wildlife corridor' between Mount Kenya and the northern rangelands, previously blocked by human development. The six-tonne African animal had been attracting poachers' attention as he was prone to ploughing through things . An inspiration: Charity workers across the globe have paid tribute to 'his bravery and resilience' And to dissuade him from crushing fences, they sawed off part of his tusks. A spokesman for Lewa Wildlife Conservancy project in North Kenya said: 'Mountain Bull’s death is a great loss to the conservation fraternity. 'He taught us much about elephant and animal behaviour, migration routes and patterns, and to a large extent, left many inspired by his bravery and resilience.'","Mountain Bull inspired Save The Elephants campaign in October 2012 .

"A passenger train ploughed into a herd of elephants in eastern India, killing seven, including two calves, as they lumbered across the tracks in a forest, authorities said. The crash was the worst of its kind in recent memory, said Hiten Burman, forestry minister in West Bengal. Ten other elephants were seriously injured and the death toll could rise, he said. The train was traveling at 80 kilometers (50 miles) an hour through the Chapramari Forest, near Gorumara National Park, when it struck the herd of 40 elephants crossing the tracks on Wednesday at dusk, Burman said. Horrifying: People walk past the hanging carcass of one of the elephants killed by a train on a railway bridge in Khunia range in Jalpaiguri district . ‘The herd scattered, but returned to the railway tracks and stood there for quite some time before they were driven away by forest guards and railroad workers who rushed to the spot after the accident,’ he said. Burman said railway authorities have ignored requests from his department to have trains reduce their speeds inside the elephant corridor in Jalpaiguri district, about 670 kilometers (415 miles) from Kolkata, the state capital. Dozens of elephants have died in recent years after being struck while crossing railroad tracks that run through India's national parks and forests. In December, a train killed five elephants in neighboring Orissa state. Constant danger: The unrestricted movement of trains has been blamed for the accident . The collision occurred in Chapramari Forest, which is near Gorumara National Park in eastern India . ‘It is an irony that elephants are being killed by speeding trains in north Bengal on regular intervals, even though it has been declared as the heritage animal in India and an elephant cub is the mascot of Indian Railways,’ said Animesh Basu, a wildlife activist and coordinator of the Himalayan Nature and Adventure Foundation. Basu, who blamed unrestricted movement of trains for the accident, said at least 50 elephants have been killed by trains since 2004 in West Bengal state. India's wild elephant population was recently estimated at about 26,000.","The crash in eastern India was the worst of its kind in living memory .

"A Peruvian tribe once revered by the Inca's for their fierce hunting skills and formidable warriors are clinging on to their traditional existence in the coca growing valleys of South America, sharing their land with drug traffickers, rebels and illegal loggers. Ashaninka Indians are the largest group of indigenous people in the mountainous nation's Amazon region, but their settlements are so sparse that they now make up less than one per cent of Peru's 30 million population. Ever since they battled rival tribes for territory and food during native rule in the rainforests of South America, the Ashaninka have rarely known peace. Traditional diet: Ashaninka Indian girls eat a breakfast of fish soup made with yuca and sweet potatoes in Kitamaronkani, Pichari district, Peru. Around half of the tribe's children suffer from malnutrition, government figures show . Washing in the stream: Ashaninka Indian woman cleans a pot in the natural water of the Amazon.

But where they once defended themselves . with spears and bows, now they arm themselves with guns left behind by . criminals and armed forces from past conflicts.

Hundreds have kept firearms that the government supplied them to defend themselves. The . Ashaninka live in some 350 communities centered in world's top . coca-producing valley. Despite the wealth-producing crop around them, . they live a largely pre-industrial existence. About half their children . suffer from malnutrition, according to Peru's Health Ministry. The people subsist largely on manioc, a woody shrub with a potato like tuberous root which the Ashaninka cultivate themselves. Video source Survival International . Innocence of youth: Many of the Ashaninka's younger generations have turned their backs on tribal life and moved to the cities where living conditions are better . Working the land: Ashaninka Indian Antonia Amadeo and her daughter Lourdes fell trees to make room for planting yuca. Root crops form a large part of the tribe's diet along with large rainforest rodents . Shopping bags: Ashaninka woman make their way back from a local market where they have traded for local supplies .

"The Syrian government used bombs and bulldozers to destroy residential homes in a campaign 'designed to punish civilians sympathetic to the opposition', an international human rights group said today. The demolitions took place between July 2012 and July 2013 in seven pro-opposition districts in and around the capital, Damascus, and the central city of Hama, according to a 38-page report by Human Rights Watch. The New York-based group said the deliberate destruction violated international law, and called for an immediate end to the practice. Before: The Masha al-Arbíeen neighbourhood in Hama, Syria, on September 28, 2012 . After: The clear outline of buildings have disappeared to rubble in this image of the Masha al-Arbíeen neighbourhood in Hama, Syria, on October 13, 2012 . 'Wiping entire neighborhoods off the map is not a legitimate tactic of war,' said Ole Solvang, emergencies researcher for HRW. 'These unlawful demolitions are the latest additions to a long list of crimes committed by the Syrian government.' Human Rights Watch said many of the demolished buildings were apartment blocks, and that thousands of families have lost their homes because of the destruction. It said government officials and media have described the demolitions as part of urban planning or an effort to remove illegally constructed buildings. But Human Rights Watch said its investigation determined that military forces supervised the demolitions, which in each instance targeted areas that had recently been hit by fighting and were widely understood to be pro-opposition. Before: This satellite image shows a six-story residential building on fire in the Tadamoun neighborhood of Damascus, Syria, on July 16, 2012 . After: This satellite image taken on September 22, 2012, shows the six-story residential building completely demolished with controlled explosives . There also is no indication, HRW said, that pro-government districts have been targeted for similar controlled destruction. The neighbourhoods targeted were Masha al-Arbayeen and Wadi al-Jouz in Hama, and Qaboun, Tadamoun, Barzeh and the Mezzeh military airport in Damascus as well as Harran al-Awamid outside the capital. The report includes satellite images of the neighborhoods before and after the demolitions which show the scale of the destruction. Buildings in the Hama neighborhood of Masha al-Arbaeen, a wedge-shaped district bordered by highways on three sides, are clearly visible in a photo dated September 28, 2012. In a second photo from October 13, the buildings have been pulverized into a white smudge, while the adjacent neighborhoods remain untouched. Before: Dozens of high-rise residential and commercial buildings are visible along the main road between Mezzeh Air Base and Daraya, in Damascus, Syria, in this image taken on February 4, 2013 . After: All the green land and many buildings along the main road between Mezzeh Air Base and Daraya, in Damascus, Syria, have disappeared by the time this image was taken on July 1, 2013 . Residents told Human Rights Watch that the government bulldozers directed by the military moved in after the rebels retreated from the area in the face of an army offensive. Another Hama neighborhood, Wadi al-Jouz, faced a similar fate. HRW cited one woman who lived near Wadi al-Jouz, who said the army came to her district afterwards and announced over loudspeakers 'that they would destroy our neighborhood like they destroyed Wadi al-Jouz and Masha al-Arbaeen should a singled bullet be fired from here'. In the cases of both Hama neighborhoods, local residents told Human Rights Watch opposition fighters had used the districts to enter and leave the city because of their location on the outskirts. The report also provided accounts and images of the Damascus neighborhoods of Qaboun, Tadamoun, Barzeh and the Mezzeh military airport, as well as Harran al-Awamid outside the capital. Destruction: A rescue team arrives at a building following an alleged air strike by Syrian government forces on January 30, 2014, in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo . Allegations: The latest attack in Aleppo comes as the Syrian government is accused of targeting civilian homes in areas sympathetic to the rebels . Residents said government forces gave them little or no warning before razing their homes, and it was nearly impossible to remove their belonging before the demolitions, the report said. HRW also said that owners it interviewed reported receiving no compensation from the government. Human Rights Watch said that noted that some of the demolitions took place near military facilities or in areas recently engulfed in fighting. 'It's not enough that there's some tangential military objective or benefit to conducting the demolitions,' HRW's Lama Fakih said. 'The standard really requires that it be militarily necessary, and even with that military necessity there's a manner in which these demolitions need to take place that does not disproportionately harm civilians, which has not been the case here.' Devastation: A Syrian child cries following an alleged air strike by Syrian government forces on Aleppo . Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has refused to step down from power . Human Rights Watch said it based its report on 14 satellite images, interviews with 16 witnesses and owners of houses that were demolished. It also reviewed media reports, government statements, and videos posted online of the destruction and its aftermath. 'No one should be fooled by the government's claim that it is undertaking urban planning in the middle of a bloody conflict,' Solvang said. 'This was collective punishment of communities suspected of supporting the rebellion. The UN Security Council should, with an ICC referral, send a clear message that cover-ups and government impunity won't stand in the way of justice for victims.'","Images reveal entire civilian neighbourhoods have been destroyed .

"It could be a severe case of bird-bird, or strange weather patterns causing confusion, but at the moment scientists remain baffled about instances of flamingos flying north to bitterly cold Siberia for the winter, instead of south. Four flamingos recently touched down in various parts of Siberia, to the astonishment of locals, in temperatures as low as -30C. One landed in the Evenkia district of vast Krasnoyarsk region, which is just 310 miles south of the Arctic circle. Chilly: One flamingo was spotted ambling along the snowy bank of the Usa River in Mezhdurechensk, Kemerovo region . Four flamingos recently touched down in various parts of Siberia, at the locations indicated on the map, to the astonishment of locals . A strange place to be for a bird common in Africa, southern Europe and south Asia that likes warm climates. It landed near Petr Sidorkin, a hunter who, luckily for the unusual visitor, wasn’t in the mood for targeting exotic birds, the Siberian Times reported. On the advice of local wildlife experts he and his wife fed it carrots, fish and minced beef, the paper said, and then took it to Royev Ruchey Zoo in Krasnoyarsk. Sadly, the bird did not survive. It had frostbitten legs and a low body temperature from minus 30C conditions, the paper said. Another flamingo caused a flap when it landed near the Turochack district of the mountainous Altai Republic, startling a local dog - which promptly bit it. Fortunately, it was nursed back to health first at the Novosibirsk Centre for the Rehabilitation of Birds of Prey, then at Novosibirsk Zoo, which said it has facilities in which the bird will be able to thrive. Another flamingo swooped down onto an ice lake in the Tomsk region and was rescued by fishermen.

Ticket to ride: This flamingo, rescued by fishermen, was eventually handed over to Seversky Zoo . Warm reception: This lost flamingo was handed over to Royev Ruchey Zoo . Some believe northerly warm fronts are fooling the birds into thinking they're going in the right direction . The fate of another flamingo that landed in Mezhdurechensk, Kemerovo region, is unknown. It was spotted ambling along the snowy bank of the Usa River, but flew off to an island in the river before local wildlife experts could catch it. Alexey Vasilchenko, from 'Kuznetsk Alatau' Reserve, told The Siberian Times that there have been around two dozen instances of flamingos veering off course to Siberia in the past 100 years. There is a population of flamingos in Kazakhstan, but that is far from the Siberian locations the four flamingos ended up at this year. Some are known to migrate to Iran and India in the winter and one theory is that northerly warm fronts are fooling the birds  into thinking they're going in the right direction, others think that it could just be faulty wiring in the birds internal compass. These birds are far from the only ones migrating to a surprising spot. Over 5,000 birds of at least 16 different species have made a sewage drain in Delhi their home. Seasonal visitors including the Painted Stork, Sarus Crane, Black-Necked Stork, Black-Tailed Godwit and Black-Headed Ibis have all bedded down there.

"Tucked away in the north-eastern corner of China live the Uighur people, a Muslim group who live a way of life that's different in almost every way from that of the majority Han Chinese. And life hasn't always been easy for the Uighur. Persecuted by the Communists following a failed bid for independence and accused of terrorism by the rulers of modern China, the Uighurs are hard to access, hidden away from visiting tourists and despised by many of the Han. Now French photographer Eric Lafforgue has shed light on the fascinating world of the Uighurs after travelling to Xinjiang, the sprawling semi-autonomous region that they call home, and revealed how the Uighurs are using traditional garments as a means of silent defiance. Defiance: This elderly woman, photographed in the city of Kyria, is wearing a banned Taipak - the world's smallest hat - on top of her equally illegal veil . Outlawed: Women who wear traditional veils such as this one cannot enter petrol stations, banks or hospitals and are also barred from taking government jobs . Persecution: Men who grow beards are barred from government roles. Recently Beijing introduced laws that forbid lawyers - and their families - from wearing them . Colourful: An elderly man photographed in the market at Kyria and a Tajik Uighur woman who has travelled across the border to shop sporting traditional garments . There he found people struggling to survive and dealing with endemic discrimination that includes being barred from many jobs and having their homes demolished on spurious grounds. 'The government claims it’s demolishing the houses due to seismic issues,' says Lafforgue. But the Uighurs tell a different story. 'One told me that it's not just the homes that are being demolished but their souls,' he continues. Although Muslims, the Chinese government discourages the wearing of Islamic headscarves and women are not allowed into petrol stations and other shops if they are wearing one. 'In gas stations, women must remove their veils is they want to be served,' explains Lafforgue. 'The same applies in hospitals, administrations, banks and so on. The Hans see veils as linked with terrorism. But in reality, the majority of Uighur women still wear veils.' Elegant: There are Uighur populations in most of the surrounding countries including Tajikistan, where these women come from, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan . Tradition: This young Uighur woman shows off her pencilled brows, joined together by a line of black ink. Single brows are considered beautiful by the Uighurs . Happy family: The Uighur, in a rare concession, are exempt from the One Child rule and are allowed two children in cities and up to four children in the countryside . Jealous: According to Lafforgue, the exemption has made the Han angry, with the result that many Uighur families struggle to support themselves and are very poor . The Chinese government also takes a similar approach to traditional Islamic beards, an initiative that sparked riots as recently as June. 'The measure was introduced during the 2008 Ramadan, but wasn’t respected,' adds Lafforgue. 'Nevertheless, government workers cannot have beards or mustaches.' But despite the simmering tension between the Uighur and their Han neighbours, their culture continues to flourish, not least in neighbouring Central Asian countries, including Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. And despite the Chinese government's efforts to prevent it, the Chinese Uighurs cling to their traditions, including the wearing of the Taipak - the world's smallest hat. 'In Kyria, I photographed a woman with a Talpak hat, which is a sign that the woman is married,' explains Lafforgue. 'The antiterrorism law forbids them from wearing it, except for funerals. Wearing it is a sign of defiance.' Defiant though they might be, with news yesterday of yet another Chinese government crackdown on 'illegal religious activities', the Uighurs fight for recognition and respect within China looks set to continue. Community: The Chinese government discourages visitors to the Uighurs home region and accuses the people of being separatist terrorists . Playtime: A small boy plays with his beaker, perched precariously on a tray of fruit being sold at the Kyria market by his colourfully dressed mother . Celebration: This Uighur marriage photographed by Lafforgue had been sealed off in an alley by Chinese authorities in an attempt to conceal it from tourists . Childhood: Uighur children also live a traditional lifestyle, and play with traditional wooden swords, or in this little girl's case (above) the tomb of ruler Sultan Sayidan . The origins of the Uighur tribe lie deep in the Altay mountains of Mongolia - or in Turkemenistan, depending on which version of the story you believe. According to the Uighurs themselves, their origins are Turkic and date back more than 5,000 years. By contrast, the Chinese say the Uighurs are descendents of the Tiele tribes of Mongolia, who by 842, had coalesced into the Uighur people and moved en masse to the Tarim Basin in what is now modern China. Either way, the debate around the origins of the Uighurs is yet another skirmish in the ongoing battle between the majority-Muslim tribe and the Han Chinese for centuries. Mainly tolerated during the long rule of the Chinese emperors, the real problems for the Uighurs began after the Communists swept to power in 1949. After a failed bid for independence, the Chinese cracked down on the fledgling state and the Xinjiang region which they call home is treated as a semi-autonomous state run along similar lines to Tibet. Activists accuse the Chinese government of steadily eroding the Uighurs' freedoms, among them curtailing religious, commercial and cultural activities. Beijing has also been accused of seeking to dilute Uighur influence by arranging the mass immigration of Han Chinese, the country's majority ethnic group, to Xinjiang, with the result that the Uighurs have become a minority in their homeland. According to China, their activities are justified because of the terrorist threat posed by Uighur separatists. The Uighur themselves dispute this claim. Source: BBC . Rainbow: Like their parents, Uighur children sport brightly patterned garments including elaborately beaded and embellished hats . Han influence: The route into the Uighur city of Kashgar takes you past a square dominated by a statue of Chairman Mao . Hazard: Many of the Uighur believe the Han deliberately spike their food with pork so will only eat at cafes and restaurants belonging to trusted friends .","The Taipak, the smallest hat in the world, is worn by Uighur women to show that they are married .

"Under George Osborne's proposals, people aged 18 to 21 would have six months to find a job or training . Radical plans to ban young people getting the dole and slash the maximum amount of state benefits per household by £60 a week will be introduced if the Tories win next year’s General Election. George Osborne plans to use the savings to pay for three million apprenticeships for young workers and end youth unemployment. Under the Chancellor’s proposals, people aged 18 to 21 would be given six months to find a job or training – after which their dole would be scrapped unless they agreed to take part in ‘community projects’, such as cleaning up parks. In addition they will not be allowed to claim housing benefit, forcing more youngsters to live at home with their parents. Attempts by Mr Osborne to introduce similar measures have been blocked by Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. But he will forge ahead if the Tories win power outright next May. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, the Chancellor said: ‘Our mission is not just to save the pounds here and there, we’re trying to change the welfare system so it doesn’t trap people in poverty and a culture of dependency. ‘It is a tragedy for them and a waste for the country.’ Defending the housing benefit ban for under-21s, he said: ‘It is not acceptable for young people under the age of 21 to go straight from school on to benefits and into a home paid for through housing benefit – benefit funded by other people who are working.’ Single parents and young people coming out of care and other ‘vulnerable’ groups would be exempt. And cutting dole for under-21s would encourage more to find work and help abolish youth unemployment, he argued. ‘We are saying you will receive an allowance but if you can’t find work after six months, you will have to work for the dole. They are difficult decisions but the right ones.’ Mr Osborne also plans to reduce the maximum benefit cap from the current level of £26,000 per household to £23,000. He believes it will encourage more people claiming benefits to find work. ‘Before our reforms, some families were receiving £100,000 a year in housing benefit. How many working people can afford rent of £100,000? It was a gross injustice. Since we imposed a cap, large numbers have looked for work.’ Opinion polls consistently show large public support for tackling welfare abuse. However, Labour claim the new cuts are a ‘fresh attack on the poor’. A Labour aide said: ‘The Tories are wrong to think they can win easy votes by attacking people on welfare. The Bedroom Tax is massively unpopular and now they are attacking young people. Scroll down for video . Vutting dole for under-21s would encourage more to find work and help abolish youth unemployment, he argued (file pic) ‘It is not the fault of under-21s that they cannot find work. It is Osborne’s fault for not having policies to create jobs for them.’ The dole, officially called the Job Seeker’s Allowance (JSA) is currently worth £50.95 per week for those aged 16 to 24 and £64.30 for the over-25s. Mr Osborne intends to scrap the JSA for 18 to 21s and replace it with a ‘youth allowance’ – set at about the same level as the dole. But they will only receive it for six months. After that, if they have failed to find a job, apprenticeship or a training scheme, they will have to do community work, such as cleaning up public places, to continue receiving it. When the Tories came to power there were 250,000 18-21-year-olds on JSA. The figure has fallen to 150,000. The new apprenticeships will be paid for out of savings from cutting the household benefit cap to £23,000. A Tory official said: ‘Doing daily community work will help young people gain useful experience of the world of work and enable them to put something back into their community too. There will be no option to continue on benefits if this offer is refused.’","Those aged 18-21 would be given six months to find a job or training .

"A World War Two Flight Lieutenant fled who from a Nazi firing squad after his Spitfire was shot down and escaped recapture by leaping from a moving train, has died aged 91. Tony Snell was patrolling over Sicily in July 1943 when his plane was hit by attacking Messerschmitt fighters and he was forced to land behind enemy lines. Although he managed to evade capture, Flight Lieutenant Snell was challenged by a German patrol who rolled a hand grenade at him which he managed to run clear of and launched further grenades at him as he escaped. Hero: Spitfire pilot Tony Snell who escaped the Nazi's after his plane was shot down over Sicily during World War Two . Shot down: Flight Lieutenant Snell was piloting a Spitfire when he was shot down and had a number of brushes with Nazi soldiers . Mr Snell hid in bushes before stumbling into a minefield. He managed to carefully negotiate his way to a track but was captured when he reached a German airfield. Nazi soldiers decided to execute Mr Snell and he was told to kneel down in front of a firing squad. But brave Mr Snell escaped again, running away despite German fire. He was hit in the shoulder and badly wounded but still attempted to make it back to Allied lines. His attempt failed and he was recaptured and threatened with execution again suspected of being a spy - but this time he managed to prove his identity. Flight Lieutenant Snell was taken to hospital before being transferred to Tuscany for treatment to his smashed shoulder. He was then to be transferred as a prisoner of war by train back to Germany. Mr Snell had other ideas however. He and another officer leapt from the train when it slowed down at a junction and headed south. Under fire: Mr Snell's plane was attacked by German Messerschmitt planes . They joined forces with some Italian partisans and managed to reach Modena with their helo where they were sheltered by families. Several months later, the now fully fit pair set off by train on a risky journey to the foot of the Alps. They eventually made it across the mountain range, helped by two guides, into neutral Switzerland. Flight Lieutenant Snell was awarded the DSO for the lengths he went to in escaping from the enemy. Born in Tunbridge Wells in March 1922, he had joined No 242 Squadron in July 1940 and took part in the US/UK joint training programme known as the Arnold scheme. He served in North Africa before moving with the squadron to Malta to prepare for the invasion of Siciliy. He was eventually discharged from the RAF in 1946. New home: Mr Snell set up a restaurant in the British Virgin Islands (file picture) Mr Snell's sense of adventure continued long after the war ended. He toured Africa as an actor and songwriter in a one man show and travelled around the U.S and Mexico in a bus with his wife Jackie. He also recorded an album of his songs, called An Englishman Abroad, in New York. Mr Snell returned to England in 1966 and bought a boat before sailing it with his wife to Ibiza where the couple set up a business offering boat excursions. They moved to the British Virgin Islands and set up another boat tour company which proved unsuccessful, before opening The Last Resort, a restaurant in Jost Van Dyke. The restaurant burned down a year later and the pair returned to Ibiza to sell their catamaran before heading back to the British Virgin Islands and rebuilding their restaurant, this time in Bellamy Cay, Trellis Bay, Tortola, from scratch. Jackie was the head chef while Mr Snell entertained guests with his musical talents. Although the couple's children took over the running of the restaurant, Mr Snell was still entertaining guests until a short while before his death on August 4. His wife Jackie, with whom he had a daughter and a son, died in 2001.","Flight Lieutenant Tony Snell was shot down over Sicily in July 1943 .

"Arsenal's chances of landing Lucas Silva in January could be resurrected after Carlo Ancelotti admitted Real Madrid had still not decided if they should meet Cruzeiro's asking price or not. The 21-year-old favours a move to the Spanish capital but his club want a quick sale and if Arsenal are willing to meet the £12million valuation when the winter transfer window opens they favour sending him to London. Ahead of Real Madrid's Friday night game against Almeria before they fly to Morocco for the World Club Championship Ancelotti was asked about the possibility of signing Silva in January and said: 'We are waiting to see how the recovery of Modric and James [Rodriguez] progresses.' Real Madrid are unsure whether they are willing to pay Cruzeiro's asking price for Lucas Silva . Arsene Wenger is keen on bringing the 21-year-old midfielder to the Emirates Stadium . The former has a thigh injury and is not expected to be back before March and Rodriguez has a calf problem but may still return for the final of the World Club Championship if Madrid reach it. 'We will not decide anything until the new year,' said Ancelotti. Silva is part-owned by a sports investment fund who would be owed around £4m from any £12m sale. Cruzeiro officials are expected to hold talks with Madrid officials in the next couple of days in Belo Horizonte and if the Spanish club fail to meet the asking price Arsenal will be favourites for his signature. Cruzeiro have just won the league in Brazil and Silva's consistent displays throughout the season were important in that success. He was named in the league's team of the season at the end of the campaign. Carlo Ancelotti admitted Real Madrid had still not decided if they should meet Cruzeiro's £12million price .

"Witnesses have described how an ex-SAS man and a former Irish Ranger helped to organise the rescue mission which saved dozens of hostages during the Nairobi shopping mall attack. In total at least 67 people died when al-Shabaab gunman carried out the siege at Westgate in Nairobi on September 21. Children as young as five were shot up to five times by the terrorists. In total at least 67 people died when al-Shabaab gunman carried out the siege at Westgate in Nairobi on September 21 . But it has emerged that two security . consultants took control of the rescue mission before authorities turned . up which helped to save dozens of lives, according to The Observer. Witness reports, photographs and video footage gives an idea of the bravery carried out by these two men. Mark and John, whose real names have not been disclosed, arrived at the building and immediately noticed there was no police cordon and that there were bodies lying on a balcony of a ground-floor cafe. They decided to carry out a rescue operation and managed to make their way into the underground car park where they discovered 100 people hiding behind an armoured cash-delivery truck. Children as young as five were shot up to five times by the terrorists that carried out the Westgate mall massacre . Despite heavy gunfire, Mark, who . served in the British Army for 18-years and John, a former ranger, . instructed them to safety and out of the building. They then took the decision to climb down the fire escape and into Java House coffee shop with plain-clothed Kenyan police reservists and two officers with AK-47 assault rifles where 20 people lay dead. Witnesses recalled seeing a white man in a checked shirt trying to persuade people onto a fire escape. The men were not together for the whole ordeal choosing to split up at one point. Mark headed for the rooftop where men, women and youngsters lay dead. As he came across the deceased he covered their bodies with red cloths which had been covering tables where parents and their children sat. John made his way to the sushi restaurant and began evacuating the eatery. Unsung heroes: According to witnesses an ex-SAS and a former Irish Ranger helped to organise the rescue mission . Many didn't want to leave their loved ones behind but without the courage of the two men they would not have survived. However, the brave actions of the two men have highlighted the failings of the government response to the attack. The authorities have come under fire for its response to the siege. They have been accused of failing to secure the roof area quick enough which could have prevented a number of deaths and witnesses say it took hours for a police cordon to be put up around the building. When more officers began to arrive, Mark and John decided to leave but found themselves back inside the mall after they received a text from a friend saying they knew someone trapped inside. Again, with no thought to their own lives they made their way inside the building and rescued the man. This month security camera footage of soldiers appearing to loot goods was uncovered. Kenyans had initially praised troops for their courage in battling the Somali attackers. The footage shows the soldiers with plastic shopping bags leaving the Nakumatt supermarket, where prosperous Kenyans could buy anything from TV sets to French cheese, at a time when the Islamist rebels were still holed up inside the mall. The September 21 attack - the worst on Kenyan soil since al Qaeda bombed the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998, killing more than 200 people - initially united Kenya's multi-ethnic community and sparked an outpouring of support for the military. But support for security services evaporated as shop owners returned to the mall to find their stores ransacked, with many reporting phones, expensive Swiss watches and designer suits stolen. Cash from tills was also missing, traders said.","At least 67 people died when al-Shabaab gunman stormed the building .

"For some, it’ll be the best present they have had in years. But could this year’s must-have gadget cause a fatal accident or, worse, help a terrorist to launch a deadly attack? Walk around any High Street electronics shop this Christmas and you’ll see the shelves stacked with strangely-shaped flying machines. The remote-controlled devices, officially described as ‘multi-copters’ or ‘unmanned aerial vehicles’, are usually known by a much more recognisable name: drones. Scroll down for video . These amateur drones are only distantly related to the military contraptions the British and Americans have been flying over Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years. These don’t drop bombs or monitor enemy troop movements. They look like giant Lego-built spiders, but are essentially a 21st-century version of the remote-control aeroplane you might have played with as a child. The modern-day toys hover and whizz and swoop through the air. And they’re flying off the shelves. It is estimated that more than 30,000 drones will have been bought by British consumers by the end of the year — a high proportion of them as Christmas presents. The electronics chain Maplin says that sales within its stores are up 300 per cent on 2013. But as drones move from the battlefield into our back gardens and parks, serious questions are increasingly being asked about their safety. This week, it emerged that a passenger jet was involved in a near miss with a drone near Heathrow airport in July. The pilot was flying at an altitude of 700ft when he saw the unauthorised machine, which was invisible to radar, flying near his plane. There was a similar incident at Southend Airport two months earlier — and more recently a Virgin Atlantic pilot reported seeing a drone as he came in to land at New York’s JFK airport. Frightening stuff, given that if a drone were sucked into a jet plane’s engine, it could have the same effect as a bird strike, which might prove catastrophic on take-off or landing. Drones have been put to other dangerous uses, too. In October, a European Championship football match between Serbia and Albania descended into a riot after a drone was deliberately flown inside the stadium in Belgrade trailing an Albanian flag, much to the fury of the Serbs. And sometimes they simply end up causing accidents. In New York this week, a TGI Friday’s restaurant used a hovering drone dangling a piece of mistletoe to encourage dining couples to kiss each other. Unfortunately, after colliding with one woman’s hand, it took a lump out of her nose. DJI Inspire 1 Drone is a carbon fibre aircraft which folds into a V while flying so the built-in 4K camera can take awe-inspiring 360-degree footage . However, a more serious issue relating to drones is their ability to invade just about anyone’s privacy. Because it’s possible to attach a camera to them, it is relatively simple to fly over someone’s property and take a picture of whatever they might happen to be doing in private. Indeed, paparazzi drones have become Hollywood’s most feared gate- crashers, deploying long-lens cameras and video recorders over the private retreats of the stars. One of those to complain vociferously was the singer Miley Cyrus, who spotted one hovering over her garden. Oscar-winner Ben Affleck’s actress wife Jennifer Garner has also reported seeing them flying over her property. As a result of such intrusions, American law-makers are seeking to extend privacy laws to include the use of drones. The SQ-4 Recon nano unmanned aerial drone, made by British company BCB international, in Cardiff, Wales . In Britain, there are strict regulations on where and how you can fly one. But there’s no doubt the rules are regularly breached by negligent fliers who may not have thought out the possible consequences. And what about those with more malicious intent? If a troublemaker can send a drone into a football stadium, and other users can fly them near airports, one can only imagine the harm that could potentially be inflicted by an extremist whose aim is to bring down an airliner. The Civil Aviation Authority, the same agency that governs commercial airlines, is in charge of drawing up and enforcing the regulations around drones. It declines to comment on the security implications of the Heathrow incident, but its official guidance on the use of drones is stiffly worded: ‘Unmanned aircraft, irrespective of their size, are still classified as aircraft — they are not toys.’ It adds: ‘The person in charge of operating the controls of an unmanned aircraft is referred to as the pilot.’ The CAA rules forbid you from flying your drone within 50m (164ft) of any ‘person, vessel, vehicle or structure not under the control of the pilot’. Flying too close to a building, for example, is a breach of Article 167 of the Air Navigation Order 2009 and the maximum penalty is a £2,500 fine. You must also keep the machine within sight at all times — which the CAA interprets as meaning you’re not allowed to fly your machine at any altitude higher than 400ft. The problem is that though the CAA says drones are not toys, that’s not the view of most owners. The regulations should stop most people from flying their drone in their back garden or their local park. But how strictly is the law enforced? The CAA admits there have only ever been two convictions — one man was ordered to pay £300 for flying a drone over some rides at Alton Towers (while he was standing in the car park). Another was fined £800 for flying a drone too close to a bridge, and near a nuclear submarine site (a separate offence). But the first lawbreaker was caught only because he’d posted video footage on YouTube which had been shot from his drone, and the second was nabbed because he’d inadvertently filmed his car number plate as the drone took off. Neither was apprehended at the time of the offence. Realistically, how many local police officers are going to know the detail of the law if they see someone playing with a drone in his local park? So will the strict laws dampen demand? It’s unlikely. TGI Friday's has launched the country's first mistletoe drone - which can travel up to 35mph - and hovers above customers in a bid to spark some romance . ‘This is the year that drones have moved into the mainstream,’ says Riccardo de Felice, owner of Marionville Models in Edinburgh, which has been selling flying toys for four decades. ‘That’s because you can buy a really good drone for a relatively small amount, with a good camera, that’s ready to fly as soon as you take it out of the box.’ For less than £50, you can buy a battery-powered drone with four motors that’ll do whatever you command it to. For a little more money, your drone will hover perfectly still, then loop the loop, all the while beaming back broadcast-quality video of the landscape below. You can see the appeal. These machines are great fun to play with — if a little daunting at first. Couples put their cutlery down to kiss each other as it flew 8ft above tables at the Manchester Royal Exchange restaurant . Earlier this year, I got my hands on a top-of-the-range model being used by a farmer to scare birds away from his crops. (At least, that was his story — his main motivation appeared to be bossing about this extraordinary beast as it whizzed and buzzed its merry path through the sky, swooping down to the crops below.) He let me have a go, and it was an amazing thrill: I felt like a master of the universe. The noise! The power! Not all drones are as hefty and macho as that. The cheapest on the market, the Hubsan X4, costs less than £30 and fits in the palm of your hand, which means it is small and light enough for you to fly it indoors. Less giant spider, more an oversized (and playful) flea. The little X4 can’t really cope in anything stronger than a breeze, but the more you spend, the sturdier your drone gets. And at the higher-end of the scale, the models come with GPS, the same satellite positioning system that your car’s satnav relies on. It means the drone knows its precise position in space at every moment, and it automatically compensates for any change in windspeed by returning to the same spot if it’s blown sideways. As a result, it can hover and take photographs from the same place. So will all the thousands of people who get a drone for Christmas really abide by the regulations? Oliver Meakin, managing director of Maplin Direct, says: ‘We wouldn’t want any of our customers thinking that it’s a good idea to put a drone over Heathrow, because that’s clearly a very irresponsible thing to do.’ He says that Maplin makes sure all customers are made aware of the law. ‘But if they then choose to disregard the law, that is for them to decide.’ Of course, if you see a drone fitted with a camera hovering over your garden, there’s one drastic measure you could resort to: shoot it down. Now, where did I put my shotgun . . .","Up to 30,000 of the remote-controlled devices predicted to be sold this year .

"Get ready for a close encounter - of the blurred kind. In recent weeks there have been bizarre claims of alien cities on Mars, hovering saucers and artificially designed rocks. But now a shaky video has shown a UFO floating above the Statue of Liberty - leading some to question if extraterrestrial life has been secretly making its way to Earth. A video posted to YouTube shows a black object floating above the Statue of Liberty in New York (shown in red ring). In the video the object moves across the screen before staying still. It moves at a steady speed across the sky before coming to rest. Some have suggested that it might be an alien UFO . The video, posted to YouTube by Scott Kensington, shows a black orb hovering above the famous landmark in New York. The object makes its way slowly across the screen from right to left before then appearing to remain stationary in the air. And some have speculated that it may be an alien spaceship making its way slowly across the sky. Speaking to MailOnline, Dr Susah Schneider said that the first alien life we find might be a form of artificial intelligence - and it could indicate that humans, too, will one day be more machine than man. ‘If you look at our own civilisation, people are becoming more immersed in computers, and we can already see signs of it in our own culture,' she said. ‘So it looks like the next evolutionary step could be we are post-biological, we are sort of part computer in that people decide to “upload” themselves. ‘It sounds kind of crazy, and I don’t approve of this as a philosopher, but I think the thing is that that’s sort of the pattern a lot of people are starting to notice. ‘Aliens will be vastly older than us, so it looks like they may be sophisticated forms of AI that are far smarter than we are.' ‘Of course, there's always the possibility this was a real UFO sighting,’ reported the Examiner. ‘Silver orb spaceships are the latest trend, along with triangular aircraft performing amazing aeronautical feats. ‘So far, this UFO sighting seems to be the first incident catching a pulsating black orb UFO on video.’ On the video Mr Kensington explained how his wife and sister filmed the UFO while they were visiting New York City. He said the shaking was due to her being ‘freezing from holding the camera for so long with no gloves.’ He continued: ‘She said at first she thought it was a balloon but it stopped all of a sudden and stayed in one place for a while. ‘She also ran out of disc space hence why the footage suddenly stopped. ‘What the hell was this guys. Please tell me someone else got this on video to [sic].’ While the prospect of this being an alien spaceship is alluring, the real answer is almost certainly that it is actually a solar balloon. A solar balloon is a black or dark object that gains buoyancy by being heated by the sun’s radiation. Heat inside the balloon expands as it is heated, causing it to rise as it has a lower density than the surrounding air. Some have suggested that solar balloons could be used to explore Mars quickly and easily some day in the future. But for now they are only used on Earth - sometimes to perform experiments in the sky. While the prospect of this being an alien spaceship is alluring, the real answer is almost certainly that it is actually a solar balloon (pictured). A solar balloon is a black or dark object that gains buoyancy by being heated by the sun’s radiation . UFO expert Nigel Watson explained to the MailOnline that it was indeed most likely a solar balloon or possibly also a drone ‘as it flies on a steady course’. He speculated that it may have been staged, saying it is suspicious because ‘it flies directly behind one of the world’s most famous landmarks.’ And he added: ‘Also the camera suddenly cuts to a wider angle before the UFO re-emerges. ‘It is noteworthy that hoaxers have used helium filled Mylar plastic 'solar balloons' in South America to create mass sightings of UFOs. ‘Solar balloons are cheap to make or purchase, and can be identified because they do not make sudden or erratic movements and travel at a regular speed.’","Video posted to YouTube shows object floating across sky in New York .

"Covered in 'fish scales', Nusrit Shaheen lives each day in agonising pain, the oldest survivor of a rare skin disease. For the 30-year-old, each day is a battle. But she refuses to let her condition get in the way of living her life, playing sport and studying - determined to be a role model for children affected. She suffers Harlequin Ichthyosis - an extremely rare genetic disorder which causes the skin to grow seven times faster than normal. Scroll down for video . Nusrit Shaheen, 30, suffers Harlequin Ichthyosis, an extremely rare genetic disorder which affects around five babies a year in the UK. She is pictured with her nephew Hassan . The extremely rare genetic disorder causes the skin to appear tight the development of thick plates of hard scales that resemble armour plating. The skin splits at several areas causing deep cracks. And a sufferer's face looks stretched with turned out lips and eyelids, and the ears, hands and feet may be hidden by scales . The skin appears tight, with thick plates of hard scales resembling armour plating or the harlequin suit of a jester. The skin splits at several areas causing deep cracks. And a sufferer's face looks stretched with turned out lips and eyelids, and the ears, hands and feet may be hidden by scales. Four of Miss Shaheen's siblings died from the disease at birth. And at 30 years old, she is thought to be Britain's oldest survivor. Last year she was hospitalised with a bacterial infection and prescribed antibiotics, which caused all her toenails to fall off. And with the return of the cold weather, Miss Shaheen faces being confined to a wheelchair, as her skin stiffens up and cracks, restricting her ability to move. 'I've been in good health recently,' she said. 'It has its ups and downs. Harlequin Ichthyosis is extremeley rare, and comes out of the blue.

'The cold weather really affects the condition so I'm braced for winter. 'My skin stiffens up when it's freezing so it can be really painful and tough to move.' Miss Shaheen, from Coventry, said she hopes she can be an example and inspiration to others who live in pain every day. Babies born with Harlequin Icthyosis have diamond-shaped scales that can cause problems with the respiratory system and restrict their movement. The cracks that appear in the skin can lead to dangerous infections, leaving sufferers bed-bound or hospitalised for weeks at a time. The condition, caused by a mutated gene carried by her parents, makes skin grow seven times faster than normal. The extra skin needs to be removed constantly and ointment is also applied four or five times-a-day. Miss Shaheen uses the moisturiser Hydromol and goes through three tubs of the over-the-counter cream every week. She said: 'It's strange. It's exciting to be the oldest person to survive with this condition but at the same time a little bit scary. Four of Miss Shaheen's siblings died from the disease at birth.

I have had to put up with this all my life so I've become used to it now. 'I usually ignore it, but if it gets to me then I'll say something or pull a face. That works.'

"Alan Pardew has been named the Barclays Premier League manager of the month for November after guiding Newcastle to three victories from four matches. Pardew's side beat Liverpool 1-0 at St James' Park, overcame West Bromwich Albion 2-0 at the Hawthorns and also claimed a 1-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers at home. The only blot on Pardew's copybook for November was a 1-0 loss against West Ham United at Upton Park. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alan Pardew shares secrets to Newcastle's recent success .

Sam Allardyce (West Ham United) November: . Alan Pardew (Newcastle United) It is the third time Pardew has picked up the award during his career, placing him joint-14th in the all-time list of managerial winners. In fact, the last time the Englishman won it was a year ago in November 2013, when his Magpies side went on a superb run and shot up into the top five in the Premier League. The first time Pardew claimed the accolade was in February 2006, while he was manager of West Ham. The award completes quite a turnaround for Pardew who saw a large section of the Magpies faithful calling for his sacking after Newcastle's dreadful start to the season. With the Tynesiders languishing in the bottom three of the Premier League in the middle of October, it took a 1-0 home victory over Leicester City to turn their campaign around. Pardew had come under pressure from Newcastle supporters earlier in the season who called for his sacking .

But, in their previous home match, the Magpies trailed Hull City 2-0 and a group of supporters raised banners with 'SackPardew.com' emblazoned across them - a website which had been set up with the sole objective to have the Newcastle boss removed from his position. Papiss Cisse's two goals rescued a point for Pardew's seemingly beleaguered side and there has been quite a turnaround in fortunes in recent weeks. Since then, Pardew's side have claimed eight victories from 12 matches in all competitions - including becoming the first side to beat league leaders Chelsea. The Magpies will head to the Emirates for Saturday's late kick-off this weekend as they look to pile more misery on Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger. However, Pardew will be forced to field third-choice goalkeeper Jak Alnwick - who is just 21 - and the supposed 'curse' of the manager of the month could potentially strike again as a result. The other nominees for the November managerial award were Chelsea's Jose Mourinho - whose side remained unbeaten at the top of the Premier League until last weekend - Burnley boss Sean Dyche and Manchester City's Manuel Pellegrini.

It is often said that the Premier League manager of the month award is a 'curse' for any boss; their side will inevitably lose their next match. Newcastle travel to the Emirates to face Arsenal on Saturday evening and look set to field a third-choice goalkeeper, so the supposed 'curse' could come back to bite Pardew. Here, Sportsmail looks at whether or not the 'curse' is fact or fiction... - The 'curse' hit Swansea City manager Garry Monk as his side succumbed to a 4-2 loss away at Chelsea after he won the August award. Perhaps it is unfair to say a curse struck when losing away at the league leaders, however. - Southampton boss Ronald Koeman celebrated his September award by hammering Sunderland 8-0 in the most eye-catching result of the season so far. It seems the supposed curse did not affect the Saints. - October's winner Sam Allardyce saw his West Ham United side draw 0-0 away at Aston Villa, hardly a curse there either.

"The Arizona Cardinals edged closer to a play-off spot with a 12-6 win in St Louis, but they were forced to play their fourth quarterback of a bruising season. Drew Stanton injured his right knee during a sack by Aaron Donald midway through the third quarter with Ryan Lindley making his first appearance since 2012. Starter Carson Palmer was ruled out for the season with a torn ACL during last month's 31-14 win over St Louis and history repeated itself with a rueful-looking Stanton carted off for tests. Arizona Cardinals quarter back Stanton is taken off the field on a cart after being injured . Drew Stanton suffered a knee injury and could face a spell on the sidelines . Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians said after the game that the team will await further tests to determine how serious the injury is. 'We know he has a knee injury,' he said. 'We have no idea what the extent of it is. He's had a knee injury before, so there's not any knowledge whatsoever with him. We'll take it very slow with him and see how it goes, once we get the MRI and more information.' The Rams allowed points for the first time in more than nine quarters as Chandler Catanzaro kicked the first of four field goals early in the second. Despite Stanton's injury and a forgettable performance from Lindley, who completed four out 10 passes for 30 yards, Arizona's stout defense limited the Rams to two Greg Zuerlein field goals and ended a two-game losing streak. The defeat draws a line under the Rams' unlikely play-off hopes, while the banged-up Cardinals welcome NFC West rivals Seattle Seahawks to Pheonix next week.

"The change has already been dubbed Chloe's Law after Justice Secretary Chris Grayling made reference to the case of Chloe Madeley (pictured) Internet trolls who subject victims to vile abuse are to be jailed for up to two years under a tough Government crackdown. Harsher sentences are to be introduced following a series of shocking, high-profile cases, including rape threats made against model Chloe Madeley last week. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling revealed to The Mail on Sunday that the maximum six month sentence for internet abuse will be quadrupled. Miss Madeley, who was targeted after her mother Judy Finnigan made controversial remarks about the footballer and convicted rapist Ched Evans, last night welcomed the move, saying that the most sickening comments amounted to ‘online terrorism’. The tougher new legislation is already being dubbed ‘Chloe’s Law’ after her public stance against the disturbing messages. Mr Grayling said: ‘These internet trolls are cowards who are poisoning our national life. ‘No one would permit such venom in person, so there should be no place for it on social media. That is why we are determined to quadruple the current six-month sentence. ‘As the terrible case of Chloe Madeley showed last week, people are being abused online in the most crude and degrading fashion. ‘This is a law to combat cruelty – and marks our determination to take a stand against a baying cyber-mob. We must send out a clear message: if you troll you risk being behind bars for two years.’ Currently, offenders who subject their victims to sexually offensive, verbally abusive or threatening material on the internet can only be prosecuted in magistrates courts under the Malicious Communications Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of six months. But the planned changes will allow magistrates to pass on serious cases to the crown courts, where offenders would face a maximum sentence of 24 months. Miss Madeley, 27, was targeted with what she described as ‘extremely chilling and cowardly’ threats after she defended her mother for suggesting on a TV panel show that Mr Evans’s offence was less serious because he had not physically harmed the teenager he attacked. Last night Miss Madeley said it was right for Mr Grayling to update the ten-year-old law, since it pre-dates Twitter. She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The current law obviously needs to be reviewed. It needs to be accepted that physical threats should not fall under the “freedom of speech” umbrella. 'It should be seen as online terrorism and it should be illegal.’ Scroll down for video . The change comes after model Chloe Madeley, daughter of TV presenters Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan (right) received rape threats on Twitter . The 27-year-old was abused online after her mother Judy Finnigan made comments on the case of Ched Evans during an episode of Loose Women . Sheffield United fans chanted their support for Ched Evans yesterday after he was released from prison having served half his sentence for rape. Some sections of the United supporters chanted: ‘Super Ched, Super Ched. He can do what he wants’ as the League One team visited Bradford. The fans’ show of support follows reports Evans was to be offered a two-year £500,000 contract by his former club – although United insist they have made no such decision. Judy Finnigan’s comments on Evans’s case led to the trolling of her daughter Chloe. Sky Sports News presenter Charlie Webster said she would quit her role as a ‘patron’ of Sheffield United if the club were to re-sign Evans. Webster told Radio 5 Live: ‘You will have young people cheering him on when he scores a goal. Not under my name.’ West Ham vice-chairman and Apprentice star Karren Brady agreed, saying there is ‘no place anywhere in football’ for Evans. Former Welsh international Evans, 25, was released last week after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman. Her remarks come after her father, TV presenter Richard Madeley, warned the trolls: ‘Prosecution awaits you.’ The changes will be made as an amendment to the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill currently going through Parliament. They would also give the police more time to collect enough evidence to enable successful prosecutions to be brought. Earlier this month, 63-year-old Brenda Leyland, who subjected the family of missing Madeleine McCann to online abuse, was found dead in a hotel after being confronted outside her home by a Sky News reporter. Mrs Leyland was one of a number of trolls who compounded Gerry and Kate McCann’s distress by abusing them on social media. One tweet read: ‘#mccann To Kate and Gerry, you will be hated by millions for the rest of your miserable, evil, conniving lives, have a nice day!’ Mr McCann commented at the time: ‘Clearly something needs to be done about the abuse on the internet. I think we probably need more people charged.’ Miss Madeley explained last week why she had gone public with the threats, saying: ‘I always ignore the disgusting troll tweets I get because I honestly do not want to give them any attention. Kate and Gerry McCann have been abused on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook over the disappearance of their daughter in 2007 . ‘But the tweet in question took it to another level and I wanted to stand up against it. ‘There is a line where rationality ends and criminality begins. The person who threatened me crossed that line.’ Dr Az Hakeem, consultant psychiatrist at The Priory Hospital, Roehampton, south-west London, told The Mail on Sunday: 'The sadistic pleasure derived by trolling may have an addictive quality to it and the sense of power for the troll may be difficult to resist. 'The most useful intervention is to be reminded that the emotional pain inflicted is real and that they are not able to hide behind apparent anonymity, and to be held legally accountable for the actions for which they have mental capacity and intend to make.' He said that the illusion of anonymity 'facilitates for some callous and wounding attacks upon people which for the Intranet troll provides sadistic pleasure combined with the false reassurance that the attack is 'not really real' due to the lack of real face to face contact of the 'hit and run' style of encounter, often hidden behind the camouflage of the screen name.' The move by Mr Grayling follows the announcement he would include a measure in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill to make it an offence to post so-called ‘revenge pornography’ online, which would also carry a maximum jail term of two years.","Maximum six month sentence for internet trolls to be quadrupled .

"When it comes to being faithful and monogamous, there isn't a difference in the sexes, one psychology expert believes. While it's often thought that men are more promiscuous than women, Christopher Ryan, a PhD of psychology and co-author of the book Sex at Dawn, told a TED conference this week that in terms of evolution, there's no reason why this should be the case. 'We need to move beyond 'men are from Mars and women are from Venus,' he said. 'The truth is that men are from Africa and women are from . Africa.' Monogamy is not normal: Men and women are naturally promiscuous according to a psychology expert . Ryan said humans are the most genetically related to chimps and bonobos than they are to any other primate - and as a result our sexual natures are also similar. Ryan pointed out that bonobos are famous for their sexual promiscuity. Like humans, they are among the only animals that have sex face-to-face and the males have external testicles. Evolution: Humans are genetically very similar to the Bonobo . Ryan said it is this that means the males are promiscuous: 'External testicles are like having an extra fridge in the garage for beer. If you’re the kind of guy that has a beer fridge, you expect a party to happen at any moment,' he joked. He said that female bonobos are just as equipped to have sex at any given moment because they are capable of engaging in sex for 90 per cent of their menstrual cycle. Another similarity is that humans, chimps and bonobos don't just use sex for reproductive purposes - but as a form of bonding. But chimps and bonobos don't restrict their bonding to just one partner for life as many humans have been encouraged to do. Thus Ryan believes monogamy is not hardwired in either men or women. He said sexual exclusivity came later with monogamy in many societies becoming the ideal way in which to raise a family. Ryan said this was particularly reinforced in the 'prudish' Victorian era. Ryan notes that while monogamy has now become an accepted and 'right' way of life in many societies today where we are conditioned to believe that being faithful is natural, in fact, our primal urges are to be promiscuous. Or as Ryan phrases it: 'Just because you have chosen to be a vegetarian, doesn’t mean that bacon stops smelling good.'","Christopher Ryan told conference 'we need to move beyond men are from .

"Arsene Wenger defended his record as Arsenal manager by reminding supporters that he has managed in 180 Champions League games since he has been at the club. Wenger brought the issue up himself on Friday morning when he was asked about the club’s dreadful defensive record this season. ‘Since I arrived we have played over 180 Champions League games. You will see that before then they didn’t play so many'. Wenger was slightly off the mark with his estimation, however.

That’s what I always try to do.’ Wenger also complained about the lack of training sessions he has been able to take between matches because of Arsenal’s schedule this season.
