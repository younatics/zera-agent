"When the latest Goop newsletter hit my inbox, bearing news that Gwyneth Paltrow is separating from her husband Chris Martin, I had a LOT of questions. And one of the very first ones to come out of my mouth was ""What's 'Conscious Uncoupling'?"" referring to the title of Paltrow's announcement. I assumed it was just a cute little header she made up to soften the blow—something to fit within her fancy lifestyle brand's aesthetic, sort of like the way that she calls her ""best of"" lists the ""GP 13."" Elle.com: See Gwyneth Paltrow's Flawless Makeup-Free Selfie . But as I scrolled down, I quickly realized that ""conscious uncoupling"" is not just a Gwyneth-ism or a Goop-ism. Conscious Uncoupling is very much a thing, one that's been around for years, though under the radar—well, until now. Leave it to GP to always be the first to introduce any and every new-age lifestyle tip and trick we never knew we needed, even during what must be a painful and tragic time (see: oil pulling, macriobiotic diets, countless juice cleanses, the Tracy Anderson method, agave, and soaked almonds). Elle.com: Gwyneth Paltrow Wears Baggy Mom Jeans and We Need Them Now . Below her announcement, Gwyneth had doctors Dr. Habib Sadeghi (whom she's tapped for numerous Goop newsletters) and his wife, Dr. Sherry Sami, explain the Conscious Uncoupling concept at length. At a lot of length. A ""conscious uncoupling is the ability to understand that every irritation and argument [within a marriage] was a signal to look inside ourselves and identify a negative internal object that needed healing,"" they write. ""From this perspective, there are no bad guys, just two people,"" they say, expanding on the blame-free, ""it's about people as individuals, not just the relationship"" theory. Elle.com: In Defense of Gwyneth Paltrow and Her Very Public Statements . That makes sense to me, the mutual responsibility, no-pointing-fingers aspect—though not all of the super-lengthy explanation does. Err, far from it. I've read the thing over half a dozen times, and yet I still can't seem to process these parts: . ""Life is a spiritual exercise in evolving from an exoskeleton for support and survival to an endoskeleton. Think about it."" I am. I don't get it. ""There's a scientific theory by Russian esotericist, Peter Ouspensky, that the creation of insects was a failed attempt by nature to evolve a higher form of consciousness."" I think we're getting off topic? Elle.com: The TRUTH About Gwyneth Paltrow's Workout and Diet . ""Conscious uncoupling brings wholeness to the spirits of both people who choose to recognize each other as their teacher...If we can allow ourselves this gift, our exoskeleton of protection and imprisonment will fall away and offer us the opportunity to begin constructing an endoskeleton, an internal cathedral, with spiritual trace minerals like self-love, self-acceptance, and self-forgiveness."" Huh? ""The misunderstandings involved in divorce also have much to do with the lack of intercourse between our own internal masculine and feminine energies."" But what about the lack of just...intercourse? Elle.com: ""How Affairs Make My Marriage Stronger"" So I called up Jeanne Byrd, a coach in the Conscious Uncoupling method, for a little more clarification. Apparently the method can be traced back to one woman, Katherine Woodward Thomas, who developed it in 2010. (She's currently writing a book about it, which is certainly good timing for her.) Conscious Uncoupling, Byrd tells me, is a five-week course, though it takes some couples and individuals longer to complete it, naturally. (""Some couples get stuck on week one for three weeks,"" she says, like she's all too familiar.) The method upholds that there are three ""power bases,"" which are your relationship with yourself, with others, and with life, and that you need to understand all of them to get to the ""deeper truth."" The relationship with yourself is often trickiest for people to pin down, but it's central to how Conscious Uncoupling relates to divorces and separations. ""It's not the fault of one person,"" says Byrd, or even as simple as any overt betrayals and injuries from one person to another. Elle.com: Why Women Still Fake It . Instead, in a relationship, ""Each party has brought to the dynamic a set of patterns that they've been living inside of for years,"" she says, and those things contribute to the downfall whether they realize it at first or not. The Conscious Uncoupling method, then, involves addressing those things and their impact on a relationship. ""Like, say, someone had been cheated on. It's not as simple as black and white. The other party would want to address if they had done anything to contribute to that. If they had been withdrawing,"" Byrd offers. That's how Conscious Uncoupling approaches everything, with a ""we both did this, we're both responsible"" outlook, which should, in theory, keep things amicable between two parties in a divorce or separation, since they both feel guilty. And how does that relate to Gwyneth? Why might she have chosen the method for her own separation? ""Well, children really get the benefit from a Conscious Uncoupling,"" Byrd ventures, vaguely referencing Apple and Moses, Paltrow's two children with Martin, and ""Conscious Uncoupling is really growing amongst parents,"" she says. ""Oh my God, it's so exciting how quickly it's growing everywhere,"" she adds. And surely, after all this exposure, this is just the beginning.","Actor Gwyneth Paltrow and musician Chris Martin announced they are splitting up .

"When Juventus' long wait for a Serie A crown ended this month, it focused attention on the corruption scandals which have blighted Italian football in recent years. The Turin giants were stripped of the titles won in 2005 and 2006 and relegated to Serie B because of their involvement, along with several other top clubs, in match fixing. The ""Calciopoli"" affair saw former Juventus managing director Luciano Moggi banned for life by the Italian football authorities, and he is still facing criminal proceedings for sporting fraud. But while those successes were expunged from the record books, Juventus president Andrea Agnelli has told CNN that they still count for everyone involved with the club -- making it 30 Scudettos overall, not 28. After clinching the title two weeks ago with victory over Atlanta, a sign displaying the number 30 appeared at the entrance to Juve's new stadium, which has been used for the first time this season. ""Well for the official records it's the 28th, for every single Juventina (Juventus fan) in the world it's the 30th,"" said the 36-year-old Agnelli, the fourth member of the famous family which owns car manufacturer FIAT to take the helm at Juventus. ""It's a very tough matter, I would say. One of the privileges of managing Juventus is managing people's dreams and emotions -- in our emotions and our feelings we have 30."" Three stars controversy . Reports in Italy also claim that Juventus players will have three stars embroidered inside their official club badges on shirts to be worn next season. The tradition of depicting a star for every 10 championships won was started by Agnelli's father Umberto, a legendary former Juventus president. The move could put the club at odds with the Italian football federation (FIGC) at a time when another potential match-fixing scandal has been made public. The FIGC said in a statement last month that nine former Bari players were under investigation for the ""alleged fixing of nine matches in last season's Serie A championship."" Former Bari defender Andrea Masiello -- now playing for Atalanta -- was arrested as part of the probe which also implicated eight of his former teammates. In August 2011, former Atalanta captain and Italian international midfielder Cristiano Doni was banned for three and a half years for his part in the ""Calcioscommesse"" match-fixing and betting scandal involving Serie B matches. It left Atalanta, who were promoted from Serie B, with a six point penalty at the start of this year's Serie A season. Three stars on their shirts or otherwise, Agnelli, who took over the helm two years ago, is on a mission to restore his club's reputation as a major force. Statistically the most successful team in Italian football history, Juve also won the European title in 1985 and 1996. Champions League hopes . Not content with going unbeaten through the Serie A season under coach Antonio Conte, Agnelli believes the Bianconeri can win the Champions League in their first appearance in the competition since the 2009-10 season. ""It's never too early,"" he said. ""Juventus takes part in every single competition with ambitions of winning it."" The only blot on this season's copybook came in the final match, as an unbeaten 43-game run ended in the Coppa Italia final on Sunday. A 2-0 defeat to Napoli meant disappointment for Juventus legend Alessandro Del Piero in the final match of his 19-year career with the club. It was a bitter pill to swallow, but Agnelli is philosophical about the defeat. ""If they would have asked me in September, 'At the end of the year you win the Scudetto but lose the Coppa Italia final,' I would have signed a hundred times no question about it, so we're extremely proud of what we've done,"" he said. ""I think it's been an extraordinary result, let's say we've just missed a little topping on the cake and we might leave that for next year."" Agnelli appointed former Juve player Conte after sacking Luigi Delneri as coach in May 2011 and it proved a master stroke. But Agnelli -- a graduate of Britain's prestigious Oxford University -- has had to overhaul the team and the club's commercial operations in order to compete with leading Europe rivals. ""There's been a lot of changes,"" Agnelli admitted. ""What I've tried to do is to revive the pride of being at Juventus. We're all extremely proud that we've achieved that in only two years."" Star quality . Working with Conte, Agnelli has placed the emphasis on youth and players who are on the upward curve in their careers. ""We might not be full of stars but we're full of ""wannabe"" stars. He cites Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal as an example: ""He is going to become a star -- he's 24, he's got over 40 caps for his national team, he can be a star."" But Agnelli also credited his more senior players such as goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who stayed with the club despite the relegation, and has special praise for retiring fans' favorite Del Piero. ""I think Alessandro, as I've said many times, will always represent Juventus,"" he said. ""He's been our captain for 10 years and what a finale -- lifting the trophy, that's an amazing story. I think we always have to be grateful to him.""","Juventus president Andrea Agnelli claims the Turin giants have won 30 Serie A titles .

"It may be politically quixotic, but Sen. Dianne Feinstein proceeded undeterred Wednesday in seeking an updated version of the assault weapons ban she sponsored in 1994 that expired a decade later. At an emotional committee hearing, Feinstein brought together families who lost loved ones to gun violence, police officials and others to call for banning military-style weapons from civilian use. ""It is hard for me to be here today to talk about my deceased son but I have to,"" sobbed Neil Heslin, whose son, Jesse, was one of 20 first-graders shot to death in December in a Connecticut school. ""I am his voice. I am not here for the sympathy or a pat on the back. There's many people that stayed in the town of Newtown. I am here to speak up for my son."" Despite later testimony from witnesses who cited statistics in challenging the effectiveness of tougher gun laws, Feinstein and other supporters said they couldn't understand how anyone could argue that the general public has a constitutional right to weapons designed purely to kill as fast and brutally as possible. ""This is not a class. This is not a case study. People die. That's what happens,"" said Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter in arguing that police officers in his city get outgunned by criminals. ""No one has ever been able to explain why a civilian should have a military-style assault weapon for anything,"" he added to applause in the hearing room. Fierce opposition by the influential National Rifle Association and conservative legislators, including some Democrats, makes it virtually impossible for the kind of ban proposed by Feinstein to win congressional approval. Instead, the legislative focus has shifted to expanding and strengthening background checks for gun purchases, as well as toughening laws against gun trafficking and so-called straw purchases. At the conclusion of Wednesday's Judiciary Committee hearing, Feinstein acknowledged the challenge, saying: ""It's an uphill climb."" Clearly hoping the emotional scenes of Heslin and other victims of gun violence would generate public pressure on Congress to act, she said victory could be possible ""with a little bit of help from the people of America."" President Barack Obama has proposed a package that includes a ban on semi-automatic firearms that mimic military assault rifles, as well as limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds and requiring background checks on all gun sales to close a loophole for private transactions. Feinstein is pushing the weapons ban component of legislation the Judiciary Committee will consider in coming weeks. She led the battle for the 1994 assault weapons ban, which ended in 2004 when Congress failed to renew it. Photos of the Newtown victims filled a poster behind Feinstein as she opened Wednesday's hearing by saying a renewed push for an assault weapons ban was necessary ""because the massacre in Newtown was sadly not an anomaly."" Citing seven mass shootings in 2012 that included notorious incidents in Aurora, Colorado, and the Connecticut attack, Feinstein said ""we cannot allow the carnage I have described to continue."" Her proposal would ban the manufacture or sale of hundreds of semi-automatic weapons modeled after military assault rifles, as well as ammunition magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds. Anticipating arguments by the NRA and other opponents, Feinstein made clear the proposal only applied to future sales, saying anyone who legally owns one of the weapons targeted could keep it. In addition, the legislation specifically excludes more than 2,000 kinds of shotguns and other firearms designed and used for hunting and sporting purposes, she noted. A video clip she played showed how legal semi-automatic rifles can be easily modified to fire like fully automatic weapons that are banned under current law. Republican opponents of Feinstein's proposal argued that the 1994 ban proved ineffective, citing studies that determined the law had no direct effect in reducing gun violence. In one of several clashes between legislators and witnesses, conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina challenged Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn over a lack of prosecutions of people who failed to pass background gun checks. When Graham said the low number of prosecutions showed current laws weren't being enforced, Flynn angrily responded that police officers have to prioritize resources and go after armed criminals instead of ""chasing paper,"" such as failed background checks. ""We don't chase paper. We chase people who have guns illegally,"" Flynn said, talking over Graham's efforts to stop him. Another witness, U.S. Attorney John Walsh of Colorado, later responded to a similar argument from conservative Sen. John Cornyn of Texas by saying that ""we go for the worst of the worst."" ""The worst of the worst is a bad guy actually using a gun,"" Walsh said, adding that the 1.5 million gun sales rejected by a failed background check was ""a record of success"" regardless of how many prosecutions ensued. Feinstein and other supporters also noted that limits on ammunition magazines would require attackers in mass shootings to reload more frequently, providing more time to stop them. However, witnesses opposed to limits on weapons contended Feinstein's proposal would be open to legal challenge, and would give criminals who acquire weapons illegally an advantage over law-abiding gun owners. Former Rep. Sandy Adams, R-Florida, said it was not the time for ""feel-good legislation so you can say you did something."" ""Taking guns from law-abiding citizens while leaving them defenseless against violent criminals, who by their very definition do not abide by the law, is not the answer and it is definitely not the right thing to do,"" she said in her opening statement. The reference to ""feel-good legislation"" drew a rebuke from Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, who told Adams that he was sorry she used the phrase. ""I don't feel good about being here today,"" Durbin said. ""Mr. Heslin does not feel good about being here today."" Feinstein noted that the 1994 ban was challenged repeatedly in federal courts on multiple grounds, including Second Amendment protections, and survived each time. In his opening statement, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa conceded that some gun legislation would emerge in the aftermath of the Newtown killings. In particular, he said, new laws would target gun trafficking and straw purchases -- in which a legal buyer purchases firearms for others who are ineligible. The Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, was adamant Sunday that expanded background checks would not include provisions to register gun owners. But he said that responsible Americans looking to purchase firearms shouldn't fear robust checks. To Lanae Erickson Hatalsky of Third Way, an independent policy group, what she called ""political reality"" means that Congress will focus more on keeping weapons out of the wrong hands instead of a new weapons ban. That strategy reflects ""an understanding of gun crime in the country,"" she told CNN earlier this month. The NRA and other opponents contend that any limit on private gun ownership violates the constitutional right to bear arms. Even partial steps in that direction, such as prohibiting specific models, are considered a path to potential confiscation or other future elimination of Second Amendment rights, they argue. In recent decades, the NRA has led lobbying efforts that shifted the discussion away from stronger gun controls -- such as an outright ban on handguns and a national registration of gun ownership pushed by top Democrats in the 1980s and 90s -- to the incremental measures under consideration now. Erickson Hatalsky, the director of social policy and politics at Third Way, noted examples of the NRA's influence in the last significant gun legislation -- the Brady Bill of 1993 that required background checks on guns purchased from licensed dealers, followed by the limited assault weapons ban a year later. While the Brady Bill led to the background check system in use today, the NRA made sure it didn't apply to private sales, such as those at gun shows, she said. NRA President David Keene has said he expected few substantive changes in law because the emotional reaction to the Newtown shooting would eventually give way to common sense regarding gun rights and the wishes of American gun owners. His organization keeps a scorecard for each Washington legislator on gun issues, and spends millions on campaign contributions to favored candidates. In Congress, some influential Democrats join virtually all Republicans in opposing, or at least questioning, a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons like the Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used in the Newtown shootings. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who gets high marks from the NRA for his opposition to past gun control efforts, has indicated support for expanding background checks but refuses to endorse a new weapons ban. According to Reid, a bill from the Judiciary Committee was unlikely to include an updated weapons ban, but he would allow a vote on the provision during floor debate. Such a vote would amount to Feinstein's last stand on the issue.","Sobbing father of Newtown victim says that ""I am his voice""

"In the months after the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, FBI agents conducted surveillance of U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and uncovered detailed information about his alleged use of prostitutes, according to newly released FBI documents. The information is contained in documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group. Al-Awlaki lived in a Washington suburb at the time of the terror attacks and for several months afterward. The FBI documents say he visited prostitutes at least seven times and paid up to $400 for sex. The documents show the cleric paid a total of $2,320 for the visits and always paid in cash. Al-Awlaki's use of prostitutes has been reported previously, but the FBI documents show that agents interviewed the escorts, obtained detailed information about the encounters, and the FBI even reviewed the possible legal charges that might be brought against him. One prostitute said al-Awlaki visited her on February 4, 2002, and she first peered out at him through a peephole in the hotel room door.  When interviewed by the FBI a day later, she said she thought al-Awlaki ""looked like Osama bin Laden."" American-born radical cleric understood the West . The documents obtained by Judicial Watch also include some handwritten surveillance reports by FBI agents. The papers show nothing incriminating and merely recount his visits to stores, to his mosque and other locations. Al-Awlaki was killed in Yemen by a U.S. missile strike in September 2011. By that time, U.S. officials said, he had become a key member of the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and was involved in two failed terror plots against the United States.  One was the 2009 scheme to explode a bomb hidden in an operative's underwear on a U.S.-bound airliner and the other was a 2010 plot involving bombs hidden in printers on cargo planes. Al-Awlaki: al Qaeda's rock star no more . There have been questions for years about when al-Awlaki became radicalized.  One largely redacted document from February 4, 2002, contained abbreviated language indicating that al-Awlaki was a member of a terrorist organization and should be approached with caution. The rest of the document's message was not provided, but that item and other documents make it clear he was under investigation. Judicial Watch noted that al-Awlaki spoke at a Pentagon luncheon the next day. The 9/11 Commission report said al-Awlaki had contact with two of the hijackers -- Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar  -- the year before the attacks when he served as an imam at a San Diego mosque. He also may have had contact with one of those men and a third hijacker, Hani Hanjour, when he served at a mosque in Falls Church, Virginia, in 2001. A December 2006 FBI memo that was part of the FOIA release said the cleric was interviewed in September 2001 after the terror attacks and recognized a picture of one of the hijackers. But the memo said al-Awlaki was never thoroughly questioned about his relationship with any of the hijackers, and ""their exact relationship remains unclear."" The FBI did not respond to inquiries about the documents.

"At the height of his power, Zhou Yongkang controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems and prosecution offices across China -- and the domestic security czar wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of ""preserving social stability."" During his reign before retiring in 2012, as worsening income inequality and official corruption fueled mass discontent nationwide, Zhou oversaw the domestic security budget swell to surpass that of the two million-strong Chinese military -- the world's largest. As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. Away from the spotlight, though, Zhou and his family members were reportedly taking advantage of his leadership position to accumulate enormous wealth. The allegedly blatant exchange between money and power, as revealed by China's state media, would eventually prompt Zhou's shocking downfall last summer. After months of intense political rumors, the Communist Party's disciplinary arm in late July announced a formal investigation into Zhou for ""serious disciplinary violations."" On Saturday, state-run Xinhua news agency reported his arrest after the Communist leadership expelled him from the party. Zhou's case was sent to the country's highest prosecution authority, paving the way for a criminal trial that would make him the most senior official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the People's Republic. Party investigators found the 71-year-old former leader received huge bribes, abused his power to benefit family and friends, and leaked state secrets, according to Xinhua. He was also accused of having affairs with multiple women, and trading power and money for sex. Anti-corruption campaign . Many have viewed his fall from grace as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics now ruled by President Xi Jinping, who has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign ostensibly targeting ""tigers and flies"" -- high-ranking and low-level officials -- alike. ""The important thing here is that Xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members,"" said longtime political analyst Willy Lam with Chinese University of Hong Kong. Unlike Xi, who is ""Communist royalty"" thanks to his father's status as one of Chairman Mao's comrades in arms during the revolution, Zhou was born to a poor family in eastern China. His father was an illiterate farmer but borrowed money to send him to school. Smart and hardworking, Zhou didn't disappoint and went on to become one of the few local students admitted into an elite university in Beijing. That school, now called China University of Petroleum, was the cradle for titans in the state oil industry. After graduating with a degree in oil exploration, Zhou was assigned to an oil field in the country's northeast and rose through the official ranks from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s. Described by many as a capable and humbling young party cadre, Zhou was remembered more for his political savviness than technical knowledge. His political skill shone when he was transferred to the oil ministry in Beijing, which later became a giant state-owned oil company and one of Zhou's power bases. Decisive leader . Overcoming factional wars in the ministry, Zhou was said to be a decisive leader who focused on expanding domestic oil exploration as well as overseas projects, a two-pronged strategy that would continue to this day. Fast growth of business abroad made supervision from Beijing harder, sowing the seeds for corruption. In 2001, after a stint as minister of land resources, Zhou was named the Communist Party chief of Sichuan in southwest China, one of the country's most populous provinces. State media there portrayed Zhou as an eloquent leader with a clear vision, and credited him for luring high-tech companies including Intel to the southwestern province, as well as modernizing the agriculture and tourism sectors. Zhou also developed strong local ties and planted officials loyal to him -- including secretaries he brought from Beijing -- in key postings throughout the province. Zhou's big break came in 2002 when he returned to Beijing and was put in charge of the ministry of public security, which runs the country's police forces. Five years later, he rose to the apex of power by taking a seat in the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee -- with an expanded portfolio that covered all domestic security affairs. His reign coincided with a time of mounting social and ethnic unrest as well as such major events as the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic in 2009 and the World Expo in Shanghai in 2010. Ruthless hardliner . As the leadership prioritized security and stability above all else, Zhou greatly expanded police power at the expense of already-limited judicial independence, cementing his reputation as a ruthless hardliner among political dissidents and activists. It was also during this period that Zhou became a patron of Bo Xilai, a fast-rising political star who was waging his own controversial war against organized crime in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing. Bo's spectacular downfall in 2012 -- complete with tales of murder, bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention. State media cited his subsequent conviction on corruption charges as a prime example of Xi's resolve to clean up the party. Bo supporters, however, have long called him a political victim as the former high-flying politician was once considered Xi's main challenger for the top spot of Chinese leadership. Political activists and observers now note the similarity between the Bo and Zhou cases. ""Zhou challenged Xi's authority and threatened his rule -- that's why he's now being held responsible along with his gangs,"" offered Hu Jia, one of China's leading political dissidents, who was thrown into prison for more than three years on ""subversion"" charges when Zhou first took over nationwide law enforcement. ""The bottom line is: All officials are corrupt,"" he added. ""Xi can't find a better excuse to rid of his political opponents than fighting corruption -- something that helps him win the masses' hearts and minds. ""The people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles,"" echoed Lam, the Hong Kong analyst. ""People who are close to Xi are less liable to becoming incriminated."" Zhou's family, aides probed . Those close to Zhou have fallen with him. State media have reported official investigations -- and formal arrests in some cases -- into dozens of Zhou's family members and former aides. The biggest impact was felt in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and Sichuan province -- three places Zhou once ruled. Details have also emerged in Chinese media about possible skeletons in Zhou's closet, including the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of his first wife. Most stories, though, have focused on the vast wealth amassed by Zhou's older son as well as his two brothers and their families. The Zhous reportedly benefited immensely from China's booming energy and real estate sectors thanks to Zhou's deep ties to the two related ministries. Zhou's older son, who is 42, is said to own multiple luxury properties worth millions of dollars. Before even turning 30, the younger Zhou's first foray into business met with fast growth and quick success after winning a contract to upgrade IT systems for 8,000 gas stations across China. His companies also reportedly reaped huge financial gain from buying and selling oil fields and hydropower stations. State media reports also indicated that one of Zhou's younger brothers, a onetime farmer, used Zhou's influence to launch a ""crisis management"" business and profited from helping people get out of jail, enter police academy and sell steel pipes to state-owned oil fields. Other published articles have painted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around the domestic security czar before the crumbling of his power structure. ""I think, unlike Bo Xilai, Zhou Yongkang will cooperate with investigators because his family is involved,"" said analyst Lam, predicting a suspended death sentence for both Zhou and his older son. ""His only incentive now is to protect his son -- he will toe the line to protect his son.""","Zhou arrested as part of corruption probe, expelled from Communist Party .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN)  -- The Indian navy captured 23 piracy suspects who tried to take over a merchant vessel in the Gulf of Aden, between the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, Indian officials said. Piracy suspects raise their hands in surrender as an Indian navy boat approaches. In addition to the 12 Somali and 11 Yemeni suspects, the Indian navy seized two small boats and ""a substantial cache of arms and equipment,"" the military said in a statement. Among the seized items were seven AK-47 automatic rifles, three other automatic weapons and 13 loaded magazines; a rocket-propelled grenade launcher along with rockets, cartridges and grenades; up to three outboard motors and a global positioning system receiver. Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have increased this year, with armed men staging increasingly bold attacks on ever-larger targets. This year, pirates have attacked nearly 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and hijacked nearly 40, the International Maritime Bureau said.  Map: See where incidents have been reported » . The Indian warship Mysore, which carried out Saturday's operation, is on anti-piracy patrol in the Gulf of Aden, the release said. The Mysore received a distress call Saturday morning from the MV Gibe, a merchant vessel sailing under an Ethiopian flag. The Gibe reported that two boats were firing small arms at it. The merchant ship, which was 13 nautical miles from the Mysore, fired back with small arms onboard the vessel. The Mysore changed course toward the Gibe and launched an armed helicopter, the Indian military said. Upon seeing the helicopter and the Mysore closing in, the attackers broke off and tried to flee, the release said. The warship caught up to the boats, the larger of which was described as a 24- to 30-foot dhow, a traditional Arab sailboat. The dhow, identified as bearing the name Salahaddin, was towing a smaller skiff. Indian sailors boarded the Salahaddin, the military said, and the 23 suspects surrendered peacefully. The suspects, weapons, ammunition and equipment will be handed over to authorities, and the Mysore will return to patrol duties, India said. Last month, the Indian navy said it had sunk a pirate ""mother vessel"" in the Gulf of Aden. The ship's owner said the sunken vessel was a Thai trawler that was being seized by pirates when an Indian warship fired on it. Sixteen crew members were aboard the ship, said Wicharn Sirichaiekawat, owner of the Ekawat Nava 5. Two have been accounted for. One crewman was found alive after six days adrift in the Gulf of Aden, and one is confirmed dead, the ship's owner said. Indian authorities insisted that their ship, the frigate INS Tabar, had acted against a pirate vessel that had threatened to attack it. ""We fired in self-defense and in response to firing upon our vessel,"" Commodore Nirad Sinha, a navy spokesman, told CNN. ""It was a pirate vessel in the international waters, and its stance was aggressive."" He said the ship the Tabar fired on was laden with ammunition. All sorts of vessels -- freight and cargo ships, cruise liners and private yachts -- have been attacked in the waters off Somalia. In many hijackings, pirates take the crew and passengers hostage and demand a ransom. Just this month, Somali pirates captured two Yemeni fishing boats and 22 Yemeni fishermen in the Gulf of Aden, Yemen's official news agency SABA reported. A day earlier, the German cruise liner MS Columbus said it would fly its 246 passengers and most of its crew over the Gulf of Aden instead of through it to avoid any pirate attack. The United States is reportedly circulating a proposal in the U.N. Security Council that would allow military forces to enter Somali territory in ""hot pursuit"" of pirates. The Pentagon said Friday, however, that there are no plans for U.S. forces to go ashore in pursuit of pirates in Somalia.","Suspects caught in Gulf of Aden after failed hijacking, India says .

"COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- The United States faces a Zimbabwe-style economic collapse if it keeps ""spending a bunch of money we don't have,"" South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford said Wednesday. South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford says he does not want to spend money that his state doesn't have. Sanford, a Republican, has been an outspoken critic of the Obama administration's $800 billion stimulus plan. He said he'll turn down about a quarter of his state's $2.8 billion share unless Washington lets him use that money to pay down debt. ""What you're doing is buying into the notion that if we just print some more money that we don't have and send it to different states, we'll create jobs,"" he said. ""If that's the case, why isn't Zimbabwe a rich place?"" Zimbabwe has been in the throes of an economic meltdown ever since the southern African nation embarked on a chaotic land reform program. Its official inflation rate topped 11 million percent in 2008, with its treasury printing banknotes in the trillion-dollar range to keep up with the plummeting value of its currency. But with South Carolina's unemployment rate now the second-highest in the country, state lawmakers will attempt to override Sanford and take the $700 million if he turns it down, Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer said. ""They will use the total economic stimulus to stimulate the economy, jump-start it, so we can get out of the ditch we are in as a state and as a nation,"" Bauer, a fellow Republican, said in a written statement Wednesday. Labor Department figures released Wednesday showed South Carolina's January unemployment rate hit 10.4 percent, second only to Michigan's 11.6 percent. Sanford is one of several Republican governors who have criticized the nearly $800 billion stimulus package, which passed with minimal GOP support in the Senate and none in the House of Representatives. Other governors, such as California Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger or Michigan Democrat Jennifer Granholm, have said they would take any money Republican-led states reject. But Sanford told reporters that taking the money now would leave the state in the lurch in two years, ""when those funds dry up."" ""Fundamentally, if you boil down what the stimulus means for South Carolina, it means we would go through the process of spending a bunch of money we don't have,"" he said. The stimulus measure allows state legislatures to override governors and take the money -- a provision championed by South Carolina congressman James Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House. Clyburn said Sanford is unlikely to get any waiver from the administration, and he called the governor's announcement ""100 percent political posturing."" ""This recovery package is designed to stabilize communities, to save and create jobs, and help our economy get back in a growth mode,"" he told reporters. ""And you don't do that by paying down debt that's been incurred over a long period of time."" And Bauer said that if South Carolina turns down the money, ""South Carolina taxpayers will be taking on the debt for economic stimulus money sent elsewhere."" Sanford has been called a potential GOP presidential contender in 2012, but he told CNN that the next election is ""not where I'm focused."" ""I don't rule anything in, I don't rule anything out,"" he said, adding, ""If anything came along like that, it would be an incredibly long shot.""","South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford has vowed to refuse some of his state's share .
Sanford casts stimulus as exercise in printing money that doesn't exist to create jobs .
The governor compares it to Zimbabwe's 11 million percent inflation rate .

"Nelson Mandela managed one more victory in death: subjecting a who's who of the world's dictators to the indignity of sitting through a memorial service that overflowed with praise for the principles of democracy, freedom and equality. It's a pity that so many are focusing on a handshake between President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. They are missing the much more poignant events that unfolded during Tuesday's memorial service in South Africa. Sure, the handshake was noteworthy, maybe even meaningful. But any satisfaction Castro might have found in the gesture, any comfort authoritarian regimes might have drawn from the moment of politeness toward a dictator, dissolved in the far more powerful message of the entire event -- and of Obama's own resonant speech. You can blame Obama for other things, but don't deny this was a piercing speech, a full-throated defense of democracy and freedom. That rainy morning in Johannesburg brought no joy to tyrants. Obama paid homage to Mandela, ""Madiba,"" his tribal name, as ""the last great liberator of the 20th century,"" who ""showed us the power of action; of taking risks on behalf of our ideals."" And he reflected on the human traits that made Mandela special. ""I'm not a saint,"" Obama quoted Mandela saying, ""unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying."" Everyone in the audience could nod, recognizing the struggle to persevere in their own lives. But Obama came not only to praise a man; he came to shine a light on the values that made him worthy of admiration and the causes that made his struggle reverberate the world over. It was a moment for stony discomfort among those who traveled to South Africa representing undemocratic, repressive regimes. ""Like America's founding fathers,"" Obama noted, ""[Mandela] would erect a constitutional order to preserve freedom for future generations, a commitment to democracy and rule of law ratified not only by his election, but by his willingness to step down from power."" Consider who was sitting in the stadium listening to this tribute to rule of law and democracy, to handing power to an elected successor. It wasn't just Castro, who along with his older brother Fidel has ruled Cuba for more than half a century without permitting a democratic election, while engaging, according to human rights organizations, in ""repression of independent journalists, opposition leaders and human rights activists."" Along with Castro in the VIP stand, ostensibly honoring Mandela's legacy, sat countless dictators and their right-hand men. It included the likes of Swaziland Prime Minister Sibusiso Dlamini, representing the small kingdom described by Freedom House as ""a failed feudal state,"" where the king uses photos of beautiful girls to attract tourists, ""distracting outsiders from Swaziland's shocking realities of oppression, abject poverty, hunger and disease."" Freedom House says that in the past 40 years, ""two despots have used Swaziland for their personal purposes while ignoring the needs of the Swazi people and their legitimate rights to have a say over how they are governed and how the country's resources are used"" -- the very antithesis of Mandela's struggle. Mandela was, indeed, human and flawed. But there were aspects of his life that seemed superhuman. Among them was his ability to forgive his former enemies. That was a part of Obama's message that should have made some of the visiting VIPs cower in shame. Obama quoted Mandela's words during his 1964 trial, when he said, ""I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination."" Citing those particular words was like unleashing daggers against the likes of Robert Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe since 1987, who sat in the audience along with scores of celebrities and foreign dignitaries. Like Mandela, Mugabe led his country to victory over white rule. But unlike his neighbor, Mugabe grasped for power without letting go, and engaged in a vindictive campaign against white Zimbabweans that wrought misery for blacks and whites. In his speech, Obama didn't leave his audience to unpack the condemnation of the hypocrites that he brought thinly wrapped in praise for Mandela. He unpacked it all himself and placed it in the center of the arena: ""There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba's struggle for freedom but do not tolerate dissent from their own people,"" a truth as piercing as the blaring vuvuzelas from South Africans celebrating the life of their beloved hero. You could list the men, the countries, the regimes, that should have felt directly attacked by Obama's words in a crowd that included envoys from China, Saudi Arabia, Chad, Jordan and many other states whose leaders are not popularly elected and the many others guilty of repression and human rights violations. Obama called out the hypocrisy, although the truth is that it was inescapable in many of the comments that followed news of Mandela's death. If we had a prize for the most brazen display of duplicity following Mandela's passing, we would have fierce competition but one indisputable winner. That would be the Syrian dictator, President Bashar al-Assad, whose statement of condolence was posted on the Syrian Presidency's Facebook page, calling Mandela ""an inspiration to the all the vulnerable peoples of the world, in the expectation that oppressors and aggressors will learn..."" The statement elicited bitter laughter around the world. Mandela was not perfect, but there is a reason why his life inspired billions of people and his death brought what might have been the largest gathering of world leaders in modern history. He stood for values and principles that have gained universal legitimacy. Those include the right to fair and equal treatment for all and the right of all people to choose their own government. The way Mandela lived his life was a call to forgiveness and reconciliation. It was U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon who called Mandela ""one of our greatest teachers."" Like all the best teachers, Mandela managed one more lesson during his memorial service, and it was Obama, the professor, the man whose own career might not have reached the pinnacle, who served as Mandela's principal assistant that day, imparting a much-needed lesson for despots.","Frida Ghitis: Nelson Mandela's death resulted in a moment of truth for dictators, oppressors .

"The Texas Attorney General's Office said Wednesday that it has started legal proceedings to seize the 1,600-acre ranch where prosecutors say polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs and others sexually abused children. Greg Abbott's office said the move marks the final chapter of a nearly five-year effort to pursue widespread criminal misconduct charges at the Yearning for Zion ranch near Eldorado, Texas. Four hundred children were removed from the complex, then returned after the Texas Supreme Court ruled the state had no right to remove them and lacked evidence to show they were in imminent danger of abuse. Child protection officials said they found a ""pervasive pattern"" of sexual abuse on the ranch through forced marriages between underage girls and older men. In August 2011, a Texas jury found Jeffs guilty of sexual assault against two girls, ages 12 and 15. He is serving a life sentence. The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints openly practices polygamy on the YFZ Ranch, as well as in the twin border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Critics of the sect say young girls are forced into ""spiritual"" marriages with older men and sexually abused. Sect members have denied that any sexual abuse takes place. Their attorneys were not immediately available for comment.","Attorney General Greg Abbott's office: Move marks the final chapter of a nearly 5-year effort .

"A follower of Charles Manson accused of attempting to smuggle a cell phone to the notorious cult leader has been arrested, California prison officials said Tuesday. Craig Hammond was allegedly caught with a wristwatch cell phone while being searched Sunday at Corcoran State Prison ahead of a planned visit with Manson, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections. The 63-year-old Hammond was arrested on suspicion of attempting to bring a cell phone into a prison, conspiracy to commit a crime and unauthorized communication with an inmate, Thornton said. Hammond was taken into custody by the King County Sheriff's Department. He was later released on $30,000 bail, officials said. Hammond visits regularly with Manson, telling CNN in 2009 that he moved close to Corcoran prison so he could be near the man he believes possesses deep insight into environmental issues. Hammond told CNN he goes by Gray Wolf, a name he says was given to him by Manson -- who was known to name members of his infamous ""family"" of followers in the 1960s. Manson has twice been caught in possession of a cell phone in his prison cell: Once in 2009, when authorities found a phone under his bed, and again in 2011. Manson was initially sentenced to death for the grisly 1969 slayings of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six others, including Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, by a group of his followers as part of what prosecutors said was an attempt to incite an apocalyptic race war during the country's massive social unrest. Manson's death sentence was changed to life in prison after California's death penalty was overturned for a period during the 1970s. He has been denied parole 12 times.","Craig Hammond, 63, is a follower of Charles Manson and visits him often .

"Morten Storm, a Danish double agent who says he worked with the CIA and Danish intelligence to track down American-born al Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, says the Danish intelligence agency PET tried to buy his silence after he stopped working for them earlier this year. Storm claims the Danish intelligence agency offered payments totaling 1.5m Danish Krone ($260,000) over a five-year period. He told the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten that PET had offered him the money tax free, after the agency became aware that he was considering going public with his story. But he said he rejected the offer because PET had broken a series of promises to him, including providing permanent residence status in Denmark for his foreign wife. Instead he told Jyllands-Posten his extraordinary story -- which spanned five years and several trips to Yemen as a double agent -- as well as a close relationship with CIA officers, according to Storm's account. The revelations, backed up extensive corroborating evidence, have sent shock waves through Denmark, and led to calls for greater oversight of the country's intelligence services. Danish law prohibits the security services from being involved in assassinations. The Danish biker and the trail that led to Al Qaeda's most wanted . ""We have documented clearly that the Danish secret service took part in mission to locate Anwar al-Awlaki and that raises the question because, it was known at the time the U.S. was ready to kill him if they had the chance,"" Jyllands-Posten editor Pierre Collignon told CNN. The disclosure Sunday by Storm of the cash offer has heightened the political controversy in Denmark, and led to allegations Danish authorities were trying to cover up illegal activity. Storm had previously provided Jyllands-Posten an audio recording from this summer in which one of his Danish intelligence handlers appeared to hold out the possibility of payments. ""What annoys me about is the way you treated me last year with Anwar,"" Storm is heard saying on the recording. ""Yes, yes. But that's it, [we're] trying to make up for [it] now,"" his handler replied, according to Jyllands-Posten. PET director Jakob Scharf  two weeks ago said that his agency ""did not contribute during the military operation that led to the killing of al-Awlaki in Yemen."" PET and CIA have neither confirmed nor denied Storm worked for them. PET has made no public comment on Storm's latest allegations. There is firm evidence that Storm, a former biker and petty criminal, moved within jihadist circles after converting to Islam in the late 1990s -- becoming known as Murad Storm. Storm, who befriended al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2006, claims he approached Danish intelligence later that year after becoming disillusioned with radical Islam, and subsequently worked with them and the CIA to locate and target the cleric. Storm detailed three attempts by the Western intelligence agencies to locate and target al-Awlaki. The first came after Storm met with al-Awlaki in a desert camp in Yemen in September 2009. He said that after he passed on details of al-Awlaki's location to his Danish and American intelligence handlers, Yemeni forces carried out an assault on the house al-Awlaki had been staying in, killing the owner. But al-Awlaki had already left. The second attempt, Storm told Jyllands-Posten, was the planting of a tracking device in the luggage of ""Aminah"" a Croatian convert to Islam, when she traveled to Yemen to marry al-Awlaki in June 2010. Storm said he arranged the match after al-Awlaki had requested he find him a Western bride during a previous meeting. Though Storm said he was paid $250,000 by the CIA for arranging the match, the operation failed after the AQAP operatives told Aminah to repack her luggage before traveling from Sanaa to Yemen's southern tribal areas to marry al-Awlaki. The third and successful attempt, in September 2011, according to Storm, involved him arranging the handoff of a USB thumb drive with a secret tracking device to an al Qaeda courier taking messages onto al-Awlaki. Storm said he felt betrayed after a CIA agent claimed to him, during a meeting that he recorded,  that a different operation had netted al-Awlaki, and this was a significant factor in his decision to go public. Magnus Ranstorp, one of Scandinavia's leading counterterrorism experts, told CNN that Storm's decision to go public was likely a source of significant embarrassment to his handlers. ""It is so rare that two services completely mishandle, misjudge him, and he is able to come to meetings and he has a phone and he is able to record them,"" Ranstorp, the research director at the Swedish National Defence Academy, told CNN. ""It also exposes the very secret, the very essence of intelligence services and that is means and methods, they never discuss means and methods,"" Ranstorp told CNN. Al-Awlaki's Croatian bride's 'identity revealed' The Croatian newspaper Vecernji List, in articles published Wednesday and Thursday, claimed it had unveiled the true identity of the Aminah, the Croatian women Storm arranged for al-Awlaki to marry in the hope she would lead the CIA to his location. The Danish agent, the Croatian blonde and the CIA plot to get al-Awlaki . The newspaper identified Aminah as Irena Horak, 35, who had previously worked in a care home in Zagreb and had converted to Islam in 2008, and it posted several pictures of her. The paper reported  -- according to close friends -- Horak, a cheery athletic blonde from a small town in central Croatia converted to Islam after falling in love with a Muslim lawyer from London she met at a wedding in summer 2008. Horak had been brought up Catholic. The two started a long-distance relationship, but after throwing herself into her new religion, Horak came to feel her boyfriend was not sufficiently devout because he drank alcohol and failed to wake up for morning prayers. That resulted in her leaving him, according to the newspaper. ""She changed her life habits completely and way of dressing,"" and spent all her time in the mosque one friend told the newspaper. ""She was looking for someone more radical and found him in al-Awlaki,"" the newspaper reported. Family and friends of Horak told Vecernji List they had been shocked by the news that she had traveled to Yemen to marry al-Awlaki. She had told them she was going overseas for language study. Storm told Jyllands-Posten he first came into contact with Aminah, the Croatian convert, in late 2009 through Facebook, and that she soon warmed to the idea of marrying al-Awlaki. At a meeting in Vienna in spring 2010, Storm showed Aminah a short video recording made by al-Awlaki, who was dressed in white robes in front of a pink background with a floral motif. ""This recording is done specifically for Sister Aminah at her request ... I pray Allah guides to that which is best for you in this life and in the hereafter. And guides you to choose what is better for you regarding this proposal,"" al-Awlaki said, in a section posted on the Jyllands-Posten website. Storm said Aminah burst into tears when she heard these words. She then recorded two short videos for al-Awlaki. In the first video, she wore a full black veil with just her face visible. Speaking in heavily accented English, she said: ""I will accept everything that is needed to do now this way that I have chosen and Inshallah Allah will help us."" In the second video, Aminah took off her veil and said: ""Brother, it's me without the scarf, so you can see my hair ... I hope you are happy with me, Inshallah,"" according to Jyllands-Posten. ""When I watched these tapes of video marriage proposals between her and  the al Qaeda leader, and this woman's answers, I thought well this story is impossible to deny,"" Collignon, the editor of Jyllands-Posten, told CNN. The Vecernji List report appears to further buttress Storm's account. Aminah and al-Awlaki married shortly after Aminah arrived in Yemen in June 2010. Al-Awlaki sent Storm a message thanking him for arranging the marriage. She had not only lived up to expectations, al-Awlaki wrote in a message seen by Jyllands-Posten, but was "".... much better!"" After al-Awlaki's death in September 2011, Aminah continued to communicate with Storm through encrypted messages, unaware that he had been working with Western intelligence. A few months ago, she said she was working on Inspire, the online magazine of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP. She also suggested she wanted to be involved in a terrorist attack, according to Jyllands-Posten. ""I would be making a martyr operation, but Sheikh Basir (al Wuhayshi, the emir of AQAP) said that the sisters so far (can) not carry out operations because it will mean a lot of problems for them ... so I can not perform operation. ... I want to be killed the same way as my husband was ... Insha'Allah,"" she wrote. Aminah's whereabouts today are unknown. CNN has been in touch with Storm, who is in hiding after several death threats from militant Islamists who were once his comrades.","Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten has published details of Morten Storm's story .

"Staring out over Iceland's Svinafellsjokull glacier, a cruel, frozen landscape of white ice broken by blue crevasses, it's easy to imagine myself in some distant world on the other side of the universe. It's bleak and cold, but beautiful in an otherworldly way. This is the stand-in for an alien world that director Christopher Nolan used for his doom-laden new movie ""Interstellar,"" instead of spending squillions on CGI backdrops. In the film -- released by Warner Bros, which like CNN is owned by TimeWarner -- astronauts played by Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway plunge through a space wormhole in search of an alternative to a dying Earth. While the plot might be baffling, if some reviews are to be believed, the reason for choosing Svinafellsjokull isn't. Forged by harsh winters and angry volcanic forces, it's like nowhere else I've seen on Earth -- cinematic. The same can be said for many other locations in Iceland, which is why the country's become a go-to destination for a slew of sci-fi directors. Hostile planet . Svinafellsjokull doesn't have a lengthy role in ""Interstellar,"" but it's featured strongly in posters and trailer scenes showing McConaughey walking across a hostile, wintry terrain. It looks so incredible, I wanted to see it for myself. Reaching Svinafellsjokull is easier than blasting through an intergalactic breach, but only just. What should be a five-hour drive along the southern stretch of Iceland's Highway 1 -- for most parts a two-lane blacktop that loops from Reykjavik around the country's perimeter -- is made longer by frequent stops for slack-jawed gawping at mind-boggling scenery. There are snow-capped volcanoes, plunging waterfalls, terrible cliffs and bizarre petrified landscapes coated with lurid green moss. At one point the road crosses a broad, featureless lava field whose pitch-dark terrain is only rendered distinguishable from the highway by painted white lines. I arrive at the glacier as night falls and spend the night at the Hotel Skaftafell (Skaftafelli 2 Freysnesi, 785 Orafi; +354 478 1945), an unfussy but welcoming stop in the bleak shadow of the ice field that's equipped with an excellent restaurant and talented wait staff. The hotel was used as a watering hole for the ""Interstellar"" crew in September 2013, but if the receptionist at the front desk was left starstruck by the celebs passing through its sliding doors, she isn't letting on. ""We've had lots of them,"" she says dismissively. ""They're always filming here."" Jagged world . Daylight arrives after 9 a.m. -- it's late October -- and brings with it views of clouded mountains. A weak sun pushes its way over the southern horizon and the temperature hovers a couple of notches above freezing. At a nearby hut operated by Icelandic Mountain Guides, I join a small group embarking on a hiking tour of the glacier. We're kitted out with crampons and ice axes. Our guide, Tomas, gives us a rudimentary lesson in staying upright on the ice. ""Walk like a cowboy, not a ballerina,"" he advises, chiefly to ensure we don't impale ourselves on our own spikes, but also for better balance. And then we're let loose on the glacier. Svinafellsjokull lies at the foot of Vatnajokull, said to be the largest glacier outside of polar regions. Awestruck by the sheer bombast of the jagged world stretching ahead of us, we're silent at first. The only sounds are our crampons scraping the ice and winds howling higher up the mountain. I'm by no means alone -- there are eight of us in our group, plus another huddled about half a mile away -- but looking out over this huge, empty expanse of vicious ridges stretching up to Vatnajokull, there's a daunting sense of being a long way from home. Before we get too overwhelmed, Tomas leads us up and down the great folds in the ice to the brink of yawning crevasses where glassy, blue ice plunges to unknown depths. To gauge one, he hurls down a boulder and we listen to it clatter against the fissure's walls. It's a long way down. Tomas says the glacier is advancing up to 65 meters (213 feet) per year, although summer temperatures melt back two-thirds of that advance. Friction as the massive weight of ice creeps forward over the rocks below causes new crevasses to open up and old ones to close. Higher up the hillside, where the ice began its journey about 200 years ago, it can reach depths of up to a kilometer. The size of the fissures there make the higher reaches impassable on foot. Frozen carcasses . Tomas tells us of farmers who lost sheep to holes in the ice, only to recover them as ""frozen meals"" when the glacier spat them years later. There's also a tragic, true story about two British scientists who went missing on the mountain above during an expedition in the 1950s. Decades later, what is believed to be their equipment emerged from the ice and is now on display in the glacier's visitor center. ""If you drop your iPhone here, you can probably come back and get in 20 years,"" says Tomas. ""There's a saying: whatever the ice takes, it always gives back."" With these tales ringing in our ears, he takes us down into a moulin -- a smooth-sided tunnel carved through the ice by meltwaters that's as beautiful as it is claustrophobic. Then we're back out on the open ice, tramping on metal claws across the glistening geological maze that stretches away all around us. On our way back to firmer soil, Tomas shows us the icy expanse where the 350-strong cast and crew of ""Interstellar"" spent two weeks filming. ""They booked the whole glacier right at the height of the season,"" he says. ""They built their own road to drive vehicles onto the glacier and even brought a spaceship."" Today there's no sign they were ever here. Any trace of their presence has long since been swallowed by the advancing ice. Lost, in space. Lights, camera, Iceland . It's not just ""Interstellar."" Here are some of the other recent films that have used Iceland to double for fictional realms. ""Prometheus"" Ridley Scott's pompous ""Aliens"" prequel may have failed to live up to the hype, but that wasn't Iceland's fault. The country's glowering landscape was used as a stand-in for a prehistoric Earth visited by a pallid alien creature clad only in underpants. Among key locations was Detifoss, a thundering waterfall at the far north of the Vatnajokull National Park. ""Game of Thrones"" There aren't many good-looking locations in Europe that haven't been plundered by this beard-heavy TV show about squabbling nobility, so little surprise Iceland has been featured. Hverfjall volcano, close to northern Iceland's Lake Myvatin, has cropped up in the long-running series, portraying the wintry land of Westeros. The southwestern Thingvellir National Park and the northern Godafoss waterfall have also made appearances. ""Batman Begins"" ""Interstellar"" director Christopher Nolan is a return visitor to Iceland. His 2005 reboot of the caped crusader series, ""Batman Begins,"" brought him to Jokulsarlon, a breathtakingly beautiful glacial lagoon to the east of Svinafellsjokull that can be visited on the same day. There are daily boat trips among the lagoon's stunning blue icebergs to watch seals hunting for fish. Two Bond movies -- ""Die Another Day"" and ""A View to A Kill"" -- had parts filmed here, as did ""Tomb Raider."" ""Noah"" Not even ""Noah"" star Russell Crowe could chew the scenery in Iceland, which is possibly why director Darren Aronofsky filmed his recent biblical epic here. The tale of flood and salvation used the dramatic basalt scenery of Reynisdrangar and Dyrholaey near the town of Vik -- on the road to Svinafellsjokull -- to stand in for antediluvian Earth.

"London (CNN)Amid massive global interest in the trial, appeal and retrial of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, it has been easy to overlook their alleged victim, Meredith Kercher, who was found brutally murdered in the flat she shared with Knox in Italy in 2007. Knox and Sollecito were convicted of Kercher's murder in 2009 but were acquitted and released from prison on appeal in 2011. In March 2013, Italy's Supreme Court overturned the pair's acquittals, saying that the jury did not consider all the evidence and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered. The case was sent to a retrial in Florence, which began in September 2013 and concluded in January 2014 with another conviction for murder for Knox and Sollecito. Italy's high court met Wednesday to consider whether that latest verdict should be definitively upheld or sent back for another appeal. At the time of the conviction, speaking in Florence, Kercher's sister Stephanie said the family might never know exactly what happened on the night of her death. ""I think we are still on the journey to the truth,"" she said. ""I think it may be the fact that we don't ever really know what happened that night, which is obviously something we will have to come to terms with."" Lyle Kercher, Meredith's brother, said: ""Nothing is going to bring Meredith back, nothing will take away the horror of what happened for her."" ""The best we can hope for is finally bringing this whole case to a conclusion, having a conviction, and everyone can move on with their lives."" A lawyer for Kercher's family, Francesco Maresca, said in his closing remarks in December during the retrial that Kercher had been forgotten. ""No one remembers Meredith, while the two defendants write books, speak to the media and earn money,"" Maresca said. When Knox made the media rounds to promote her memoir in May 2013, Kercher's sister said the family was not interested in reading the book. ""We are not interested in this book just like so many others about the case and we will not read it,"" Stephanie Kercher said in a statement. ""I have no doubts that on the other side there is a story of pain and loss and enormous mistrust but in the end it is also one of hope and the opportunity to live life. Something Meredith will never have and something we can never share with her. Meredith is the victim in this tragic case."" Despite the focus on Knox's endless travails, Kercher's family and friends remain determined to keep her memory alive. ""I want people to remember Meredith for the good times she had in Perugia, not just the horrible ending,"" said Natalie Hayward, who got to know Kercher before her death. ""She was very generous and open and had a very big heart. She was a very fulfilled human being. She was happy and talked about her family all the time. She had lived life to the full. That gives me a great deal of comfort."" Kercher was just 21 when she was killed in the villa she rented with Knox in the central Italian university town of Perugia. Her body was found semi-naked and her throat had been slashed. Kercher was a third-year student at the University of Leeds focusing on European Studies when she got the chance to live in Perugia for a year to study European Politics and Italian. She worked at Gatwick Airport, near her home in Coulsdon, a dormitory town south of London, to raise money for the trip. Her father John told the Daily Telegraph: ""She fought so hard to get out there. There were quite a few setbacks but she was determined to go and kept persisting and eventually got what she wanted."" Her family later described how she was ""excited at the prospect of spending the year studying there to improve her language skills, make new friends and immerse herself in the culture. She was pursuing her dream."" She moved into a shared apartment with Knox but tensions mounted between the two young women, according to Hayward, who met Kercher in September 2007. Hayward told the Sunday Telegraph in 2011 that Kercher, known to her friends as ""Mez,"" became ""frustrated"" by Knox's refusal to do cleaning and was unhappy that her flatmate kept a sex toy on open display in a bathroom cabinet. Kercher, the youngest of four children, had a good sense of humor, according to her family, and ""a sense of the ridiculous."" While growing up she was interested in poetry, gymnastics and ballet. Her India-born mother Arline gave an interview to Italian television show Porta a Porta in September 2011 in which she described Meredith's love of life. She said her daughter was a ""very loving child, a very sweet girl."" She said: ""She was always ready to help you. I will never, ever forget her."" Her father, a freelance journalist who wrote a book about his daughter -- ""Meredith"" -- described her as a ""beautiful, intelligent and caring girl whom everyone loved"" in a story for the Daily Mail newspaper, before the book's release. ""I hope our telling the world about the enchanting, generous, kind person that Meredith was can help those whose lives she touched,"" he wrote. ""I also hope this book might help to keep Meredith's case in the spotlight, and, in some small way, to keep alive the hope that we might yet know the truth about her death."" John Kercher wrote about the moment he learned the British student killed in Perugia was his daughter. He'd spoken to her the day before. ""I drop the phone,"" he wrote in Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper. ""I don't believe it and think there must be a mistake. But I know it's probably true. I can't cry. I'm numb with shock."" He also told about hearing that some of Meredith's friends planned to lay flowers at her old school after her death. Expecting just a few, he and Arline arrived to find more than 70 people, some having come from around the country. ""It's unbelievably touching,"" John Kercher recalled. A trust fund had been set up to support the Kercher family's fight for justice. ""Meredith is not only a terrible loss to her family and friends, she is also a huge loss to the world,"" he said. Richard Ottaway, the member of parliament for Coulsden, was taken aback by Meredith's funeral at Croydon Minster. ""It was packed and overflowing,"" he told CNN. ""It was quite clear Meredith was a popular girl ... so many friends there. It was the perhaps moving service I have ever been to."" The priest who took the service described how Meredith's parents dealt with that emotionally charged day. ""They were very, very courageous,"" said Canon Colin Boswell, vicar of Croydon. ""They had great dignity and calm sort of dignity which they maintained right up until now."" The Kercher family, who were not in court Wednesday, have said that if Knox's conviction is confirmed, they want authorities in the U.S. to extradite her to Italy, according to Britain's Press Association. However, as it stands, it is uncertain whether this will happen. Francesco Maresca, the Kercher family lawyer, said: ""The interest of the family is to arrive to the end of this trial. They want to be able to remember Meredith outside of the court room.""","Kercher was killed in 2007 in villa in Perugia, Italy, that she rented with Amanda Knox .

"(CNN) -- An Indian warship has exchanged fire with a pirate ""mother vessel"" off the hijacking-plagued Horn of Africa, leaving the ship ablaze, an official said Wednesday. A file photo shows the Indian frigate Tabar, which was involved in the skirmish. Indian naval spokesman Nirad Sinha said: ""Given the condition we left it in, it would have sunk by now,"" he said. The skirmish took place Tuesday evening about 326 miles (525 kilometers) southwest of Oman's Salalah port when the frigate INS Tabar spotted a suspected pirate ship with two speedboats in tow, India's Defense Ministry reported. Capt. Pottengal Mukundan, of the International Maritime Bureau, in London said: ""The pirates have been operating with impunity in these waters, and it is time now, it is well overdue that we send a signal to the pirates that they cannot conduct these criminal operations without sanction."" The defense ministry said in a written statement: ""This vessel was similar in description to the 'Mother Vessel' mentioned in various piracy bulletins."" The battle follows a recent surge in piracy off the Horn of Africa, including the weekend hijacking of a Saudi-owned supertanker by pirates based in largely lawless Somalia.  See where pirates are operating » . Three other vessels have been captured since then in what a London-based maritime official called a ""completely unprecedented"" situation. The Saudi owners of a hijacked oil supertanker carrying an oil cargo worth up to $100 million, which pirates Tuesday anchored off the Somali coast, said they were negotiating with its captors. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al Faisal said he could not confirm if a ransom had been demanded, but said the owners of the 300,000-ton Sirius Star were ""negotiating on the issue,"" The Associated Press reported. In its clash with the pirate vessel, the Tabar's crew hailed the ship and demanded it stop for inspection, and the pirates threatened to destroy the Indian ship, the ministry reported. ""Pirates were seen roaming on the upper deck of this vessel with guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. The vessel continued its threatening calls and subsequently fired upon INS Tabar,"" the ministry said. The Indian frigate returned fire, setting the pirate ship ablaze and setting off explosions on board, the statement said. Two speedboats in tow behind the ship fled; one was found abandoned after a pursuit by the Tabar. Michael Howlett, assistant director of the International Maritime Bureau in London, which tracks pirate attacks, said the recent upsurge in activity was unprecedented. ""We've never seen a situation like this,"" he said.  Watch Maersk CEO describe risks to shipping » . On Tuesday, pirates hijacked a Thai fishing vessel and a Chinese-flagged Iranian cargo ship carrying wheat in the waters off the Horn of Africa. A third ship -- a Chinese fishing vessel -- was hijacked Saturday, but word did not reach authorities until Tuesday, Howlett said. Noel Choong, who heads the IMB's Piracy Reporting Center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, said 95 pirate attacks have taken place so far this year in the Gulf of Aden. Of those, 39 resulted in successful captures; 17 of those vessels and their crews -- a total of about 300 sailors -- remain in the hands of the pirates. But the seizure of the 300,000-ton supertanker Sirius Star took place well south of the gulf, in the Indian Ocean off Kenya. Pirate attacks are spreading farther north to the Gulf of Aden and farther south off the Kenyan coast, Choong said. ""The risks are low and the returns are extremely high for these pirates,"" he told CNN. Pirates know that their chances of getting killed or captured during a hijacking are very low, he said.","Indian navy says its frigate attacked a pirate ""mother vessel""

"(CNN) -- It was little surprise that Landon Donovan described the end of his career as ""perfect."" Even the Hollywood scriptwriters down the road would have struggled to come up with a more fitting finale for the man many acclaim as the greatest footballer in American history. On Sunday, the player with a record goal tally in the MLS -- and for the United States national team as well -- left the pitch for a final time, with yet another trophy and a very last record as well. As Los Angeles Galaxy beat the luckless New England Revolution 2-1 in Sunday's MLS Cup final, the 32-year-old won the tournament for a record sixth time. As sporting farewells go, it was near perfect. Even more so given earlier this year Donovan had been controversially left out of the U.S. World Cup squad by coach Jurgen Klinsmann. In August, the pressure increased a notch after Donovan revealed that the current season would be his last, declaring his desire to ""pursue other opportunities that will challenge me and allow me to grow as a person."" At the time, there was no way of knowing that Galaxy were once again on the way to the title, their third in four years. Nor that the season-ending finale would come at the StubHub Centre, the stadium he has called home for the last decade (with Galaxy's home advantage coming courtesy of winning more points during the regular season). Neither could he known that after Galaxy's Gyasi Zardes and the Revolution's Chris Tierney traded goals, there would be the drama of an extra-time winner as Robbie Keane slotted home in the final period of Donovan's career. His sixth cup took him clear of Jeff Agoos and current Colorado Rapids midfielder Brian Mullan, both of whom boast five championships. ""It's a dream to finish like this,"" Galaxy's brightest star said in his post-match press conference. ""For me, it's perfect. All my family, more than 80 of my friends and family, were in the stadium and it's a perfect day because they know what we have gone through in the last 16 years -- and all are very happy."" With fans waving banners saying 'Thank you' and 'In Landon We Trust' in the stands, Donovan -- who had a relatively quiet game -- only dared to believe in the perfect finish with just nine minutes left, after Keane punished slack defending. ""When we scored the second goal, I began to think that we were going to win another championship,"" said the Californian, who ventured that Revolution, who have now lost all five MLS Cup finals, were better for much of the game. Filling the void . A man who spent time on loan at Bayern Munich (2009) and Everton (2010 & 2012) in his career also admitted that he will struggle to replace the drama of his old career as he looks to pastures new. ""There is no experience like what just happened,"" he said. ""If you work a desk job or a nine-to-five job there is no real experience where you get to feel that. ""I can't imagine anything coming close to that in my life going forward so I am going to miss that greatly. That is hard. ""I think that is why a lot of athletes struggle after they retire, you can't get that back. I have to be aware of that and find other things that I am passionate about."" Donovan's MLS debut came in 2001, for San Jose Earthquakes, and he promptly won the championship in his first season -- before winning a second in 2003. The triumphs were achieved while on loan from Bayer Leverkusen, the German side he left in 2005 to join Galaxy. The highest World Cup goalscorer in United States history would promptly win a title that season as well, adding further silverware in 2011, 2012 and then this year as well. As he admitted this week, he started out in an MLS league that was vastly different to today's offering -- which has been graced by Thierry Henry, David Beckham and Keane in recent years, while players such as Frank Lampard and World Cup winner Kaka are arriving next year. Where once matches were played in stadiums owned by gridiron teams and which were seldom filled, now large crowds in new purpose-built football arenas are the norm. ""I'm excited, I'm pretty exhausted to be honest,"" said Donovan while he celebrated on the pitch one last time. ""I'm so proud, so happy for our guys. As you get older, you realise how difficult this is, so to have this moment is really special for us. ""Tomorrow, I can think of other things -- at the moment, I am happy and in the moment of winning this cup,"" he added later. Robbie Rogers' joy . Sunday's match also completed a remarkable journey for Galaxy's Robbie Rogers. In February 2013, the defender came out as gay and duly quit football at the same time. Three months later, he became the first openly gay man to play in an American sports league after joining Galaxy. Now he has a second MLS trophy in the bag, having failed to fully celebrate his first title with the Columbus Crew. ""I couldn't even enjoy it -- I remember just being alright it,"" he told the official MLS website. ""I'm such a different person (now),"" the 27-year-old told reporters. ""I can't explain it. It's been a difficult but amazing journey."" In no small part thanks to Donovan himself. ""For me personally, Landon was one of the guys that helped me get back into the game,"" Rogers said. ""He's been a supporter of mine throughout my career and I've always looked up to him. ""To let him go on this vacation, start the adventure of his new life and figure out what he wants to do, I'm just so happy he can leave the Galaxy with his head held extremely high. 'Greatest player in U.S. soccer history' ""He's the best player for U.S. soccer ever and in this league, and has done so much. To get him the extra silverware, I'm just very proud of the team and I'm happy I was able to share it with him."" With 144 goals and a record 136 assists in the MLS, as well as an unsurpassed 57 strikes for the national team, Donovan leaves with a widespread reputation as the finest American player in history. One that was endorsed by Galaxy head coach Bruce Arena, the man who led the United States to the quarterfinals of the 2002 World Cup, when Donovan won the 'Best Young Player' award. He would also play at the World Cup in 2006 and 2010, when he scored a dramatic goal that enabled the U.S. to top their group, and won four CONCACAF Gold Cups (2002, 2005, 2007, 2013). ""Don't we all wish to be able to leave what we do like the way Landon did today as a winner? Can you write that any better, that script?"" Arena asked. ""I'm happy for him. He's spent, he's done, and my hat is off to him. It's been remarkable."" Yet Arena's comments before the match better capture the underlying reasons for the enduring popularity of the departing Donovan. ""I would think his legacy is that he left the game as the greatest player in the history of US Soccer, and he's a damn good person. That's a pretty good legacy.""","Landon Donovan finishes playing career with record sixth MLS Cup win .

"Edward Lee Elmore's story, which is the focus of the first episode of CNN's documentary series, ""Death Row Stories,"" shows that the capital punishment system does not always get it right. Like Edward, I know this first-hand. I was the first person in the United States to be exonerated from death row because of DNA testing. In 1984, I was 23 years old, newly married and living in Cambridge, Maryland. I had just served four years in the Marine Corps. I had never been arrested. This all changed on August 9, 1984, when the police knocked on my door at 3 a.m. and arrested me for the murder of 9-year-old Dawn Hamilton. In a matter of days I became the most hated man in Maryland. On July 25, 1984, Dawn was raped and murdered in Baltimore County. A man approached Dawn and offered to help her find her friend in their game of hide-and-seek. Her body was found in the park later that afternoon. The police were eager to find the girl's killer and ease the community's fear. Despite the fact that I did not match witnesses' descriptions of the man who approached Dawn, an anonymous caller suggested my name to the Cambridge Police Department. There was no physical evidence against me. During the trial, I was convicted primarily on the testimony of five witnesses who were later shown to be terribly mistaken. It took the jury less than three hours to convict me. When they announced my death sentence, the courtroom erupted in applause. Life at the Maryland State Penitentiary can only be described as Hell on Earth. I still have nightmares about it. My cell was directly under the gas chamber. The guards thought it was funny to remind me of that fact. They would describe the entire procedure in detail and laugh at my fate. Fortunately, a second trial reduced my punishment to back-to-back life sentences. I fought to stay safe at the penitentiary and spent long days in the prison library. At the time of my first trial, DNA testing was not a well-understood concept in criminal law. In 1992, I came across a book about DNA testing used to solve murders in England. My attorney, Bob Morin, submitted a request for the evidence in my case to be tested. The prosecutor almost brought my innocence claim to a halt when she sent a letter with a devastating message: The biological material in my case was inadvertently destroyed. Miraculously, the judge from my second trial had decided to keep some of the physical evidence and store it in his chambers. One day in 1993 I received a phone call from my attorney. The stain lifted from the victim's underpants did not match my DNA. The DNA told the truth: I was not guilty of this crime. Unfortunately, it would take 10 more years for Dawn's true killer to be identified. On June 28, 1993, I walked out of the Maryland State Penitentiary a free man. My re-entry into society was not easy. When I returned to Cambridge, I had trouble getting a job. I was harassed by my neighbors. The State of Maryland paid me $300,000 for lost income during the time I was wrongfully imprisoned, but I lost so much more than money in those eight years. During my 21 years of freedom, I have become one of many exonerees who, with the help of advocacy organizations like Witness to Innocence, travel around the world to share our cautionary tales. Even people acting in good faith can make serious mistakes. Witness misidentification is one of the leading causes of wrongful convictions in the United States. Since 1989, DNA evidence has been used to exonerate more than 300 individuals in capital and non-capital cases. Approximately 75% of these cases involved inaccurate or faulty witness identification. I am living proof that America's system of capital punishment is broken beyond repair. More and more people are realizing this. In a 2013 Gallup poll, support for the death penalty dropped to 60%,  the lowest level in 40 years. Maryland abolished the death penalty in 2013, the sixth state in six years to do so. Concerns about innocence, unfairness and other issues have led to a dramatic decline in death sentences and executions since the 1990s, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. The death penalty is fading away, but in my view, the end of capital punishment in the United States cannot come quickly enough. I am not here because the system worked. I am here -- like Edward Lee Elmore is still here -- because of a series of miracles. Not every person wrongfully convicted of a capital crime is as lucky.","Kirk Bloodsworth: I was first in U.S. sentenced to death row to be exonerated by DNA evidence .

"(CNN) -- Russian troops advanced out of two breakaway Georgian regions on Monday as the outnumbered and underequipped troops from the former Soviet republic retreated to defend the capital of Tbilisi. Georgian soldiers on a tank watch a Russian attack on a convoy outside Gori on Monday. If Russia brings its full military might to bear on its former satellite state, the Georgian military could find itself overcome quickly. Jane's Information Group, the British-based defense publications and military intelligence company, shows the Georgian military would be trying to hold off a force more than 20 times its size. Russia has about 641,000 in its armed forces, 320,000 of whom are in the army -- most of them conscripts who traditionally fare poorly against a motivated opponent, according to Jane's. Low morale, poor management, inefficiency and inflexibility are cited as problems by Jane's.  Watch how Russia takes over Georgian city » . About 26,000 are in the Georgian military, and about 17,000 of them are in the army, which has had the benefit of four years of training by the U.S. Marines, Army and Special Forces, according to Jane's. Georgia has been trying to form a professional military force and by the end of next year expected to have only a small number of conscripts in its main force, Jane's said. Those forces would be using almost all Soviet-era weaponry. The Tbilisi government has been seeking western armaments but has been told by Washington that forces must be able to use the old weapons proficiently before they get new ones, Jane's reported. Even with those old weapons, Georgia doesn't have much to work with. Its best tanks are Soviet-era T-72s, of which it has about 80, according to Jane's. The Georgian army has about 150 armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles and a similar number of artillery pieces. The sharp end of the Georgian air force consists of seven aging Su-25 ground attack fighters and seven attack helicopters, according to Jane's. Russia's weaponry is formidable. It has about 7,000 tanks, 7,000 infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers and thousands of pieces of artillery, Jane's reports. In the air, Russia can bring 650 multirole or ground attack aircraft to the battle, as well as 500 attack helicopters. Georgia has 150 surface-to-air missiles to use in the fight, according to Jane's. Of course, Russia's military is spread across a country of 10.58 million square miles (17 million square kilometers), 243 times the size of Georgia.

"Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has a message for foreign diplomats as a political division deepens in the government: Be careful. ""Over the last couple days, ambassadors have been doing some provocative things,"" Erdogan said in a speech in Samsun on Saturday. He didn't specify who or what, but the statement comes amid a deepening crisis spurred by a wide-ranging corruption investigation that has led to the detention of dozens. Raids have swept up the sons of several government ministers and others with powerful connections. The detentions have sparked a strong response from Erdogan, who labeled them ""a very, very dirty operation."" Erdogan's comments come amid a growing rivalry between his ruling party, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), and The Gulen, an Islamist movement believed to control portions of the judiciary and the police. The Prime Minister hasn't said specifically who he thinks bears responsibility, but he's pointed a finger at ""enthusiasts and planners abroad.""  Those responsible are uncomfortable with the ruling AK Party but, also, he said, with Turkey itself ""gaining power."" While Erdogan's comments have contained few specifics, his was pointed in spelling out the consequences for the ""provocative"" behavior of unnamed ambassadors. ""If you go outside the scope of your jobs,"" he warned, ""we are not obligated to keep you in our country."" The U.S. Embassy, in response to the turmoil, tweeted: ""The US has no involvement in the ongoing corruption operation."" The embassy added, via Twitter, that it is committed to ""friendship and cooperation"" between the two countries. Politics may underlie raids . The Gulen, or Hizmet movement, is led by Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric in self imposed exile in Pennsylvania. Gulen denied any involvement in the raids through a letter released by his legal representative in Turkey. ""The esteemed Fethullah Gulen has neither the smallest interest or concern for these investigations and the public servants who are carrying them out,"" said a statement issued by Gulen's lawyer on Thursday. The Hizmet movement, the name preferred by Gulen's followers, has in the past thrown its support behind Erdogan's AKP. Over the last month, though, the two have been publicly at odds. ""It was a forced marriage and now it's an ugly divorce,"" said Ahmet Sik, a journalist who wrote a book on Gulen and his influence within the judiciary and the police force. Growing tensions . Last month, Erdogan announced that he would shut down college admission tutorial centers,  a big hit for the Gulenists who use the centers for revenue and recruitment. The move sparked a high-profile resignation. Hakan Sukur, an ex-footballer and Gulen follower, elected on the AKP party ticket to parliament resigned from the ruling party. ""This is all a judicial process, it would not be right for me to say anything until the outcome,"" Erdogan told reporters in the central city of Konya. But in a fiery speech he delivered he said, ""Those who are receiving the support of financial circles and media cannot change the direction of this country. Those who are supported by dark circles from inside and outside the country cannot change the direction of Turkey."" Turkey is expected to hold local elections next year, and many analysts see the raids as a test of Erdogan's grip on power, especially after a turbulent year of unprecedented anti-government protests. Gulen posted a video on his website accusing the government of ignoring real issues. ""Those who don't see the thief but go after those trying to catch the thief, who don't see the murder but try to defame others by accusing innocent people then may God bring fire to their houses,"" he said in the video.","Rhetoric around raids heats up .

"(CNN) -- The Space Shuttle Discovery launched late Thursday afternoon from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, marking the start of its 39th and final flight. ""This was a pretty successful day,"" said Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for space operations. ""It was just an amazing event."" The six-member crew will deliver a storage module, a science rig and spare parts to the international space station during its 11-day mission. Originally scheduled for November, Discovery's launch had been delayed in order to make repairs to the external tank's support beams. And NASA halted its countdown on Thursday, at five minutes, because of a computer problem related to safety on the ""eastern range."" But after a confirmation that all was good to go, the countdown resumed, and the shuttle lifted off about three minutes behind its planned 4:50 p.m. ET launch. Five minutes in, NASA's official blog reported ""a good separation for solid rocket boosters,"" which separated from the main shuttle after pushing the shuttle through Earth's lower atmosphere. Shortly thereafter, the blog reported that the Discovery and its astronauts were ""safely in orbit,"" having ""performed flawlessly"" on its launch. Gerstenmaier noted, and video showed, four pieces of foam tearing apart from the shuttle about four minutes into launch. But the NASA administrator called these incidents ""typical"" and likely harmless, since they came off ""after the area of concern"" when the atmosphere was so thin to make its impact negligible. The crew is headed by Steve Lindsey, and includes a late addition in Steve Bowen -- who became the first ever astronaut to fly consecutive missions after he was assigned to take the place of Tim Kopra, when Kopra was injured last month in a bicycle accident, according to NASA. Prior to Thursday's launch, Discovery had spent 352 days in orbit, circling the Earth 5,628 times. It has also carried 246 crew members, more than any space vehicle in history. ""In a way, it's ... sad to see the last flight,"" said astronaut Steven Swanson. ""It's such a wonderful vehicle."" The last scheduled launch of Space Shuttle Endeavour is set for April 19 and will be commanded by Mark Kelly, the husband of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who is recovering from being shot last month in Tucson, Arizona. Atlantis is tentatively scheduled to launch during the summer. The 30-year shuttle program should have ended a long time ago, NASA's administrator told CNN on Wednesday. ""What is not acceptable is the fact that the most powerful nation in the  world, the United States of America, finds itself in a situation that  we didn't do the proper planning to have a vehicle in place to replace  shuttle when it lands its last landing,"" Charles Bolden said. Bolden hopes that at least two commercial space companies will emerge to  transport astronauts to the International Space Station. This will  allow NASA to concentrate on building a new heavy-lift rocket capable of  leaving lower Earth orbit.","NEW: A NASA official describes Thursday's launch as ""an amazing event""

"The man who got kicked off a United Airlines flight because of a fight over seat reclining says he's sorry about his behavior. Sort of. Though he regrets how he handled the recent incident with a fellow passenger who wanted to recline her seat, Colorado businessman James Beach told ""the Today Show"" that he may use the now-famous Knee Defender device again. ""Whose right is it?"" Beach asked. ""Is that my 4 inches (of legroom), or is that her 4 inches (of reclining space)?"" It's a dispute that's gotten national attention, with three skirmishes in the air over seat reclining in the past two weeks. Should the Knee Defender be banned? Although the Federal Aviation Administration hasn't prohibited use of the device on commercial flights, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines (which also operates the U.S. Airways brand) and Southwest Airlines (which also operates the AirTran brand) all say they ban the $22 device, which prevents the seat in front of the user from reclining. Beach's problems started after he boarded an August 24 United Airlines flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Denver. He had paid for extra space in the Economy Plus section, which provides United passengers up to 5 inches of extra legroom compared with standard coach seats. After taking his seat, the 6'1"" Beach installed the Knee Defender and opened his laptop to start working. Knee Defender sales soar after plane incident . The woman in front of him complained about not being able to recline, and the flight attendant asked him to remove the device, Beach told ""the Today Show."" When he did, Beach says, the woman quickly slammed her seat back, nearly damaging his computer. ""She just took all the space, and I can't work now,"" Beach said he told the flight attendant. In a ""burst of anger"" he says he regrets, ""I pushed her seat up pretty hard to put the Knee Defender back in."" The woman responded by throwing her drink on him, he says. That's when the pilot diverted the flight to Chicago. Both passengers were kicked off the flight, but neither was arrested. ""I felt terrible when we landed,"" Beach said. Aviation blogger Johnny ""Jet"" DiScala says Beach should feel terrible. That diversion cost United Airlines about $6,000 per hour, he says.

"The debate over Japan's constitution took a grisly turn Sunday, as a lone dissenter set fire to himself in an apparent protest over plans to ""reinterpret"" the document. Police received emergency calls beginning around 1 p.m. (local time) on Sunday that a man wearing a suit had climbed the frame of a pedestrian bridge near the busy Shinjuku train station in central Tokyo and was speaking through a megaphone. Onlookers said he used the device to criticize government plans to change the Japanese constitution. Police officers smelled gasoline when they arrived, a police spokesman told CNN. Next to the man, who has not been named, were two plastic bottles containing what they believed to be fuel. Police and firefighters tried to persuade the man to come down off the bridge.  As a rescue team with a ladder truck approached him around 2 p.m., police say the man set himself on fire, shocking onlookers who had gathered below. He was conscious when taken to hospital, where he continues to receive treatment. A police spokesperson told CNN that he will be charged with using flames in public without a permit, which is considered a minor offense. Self-immolation is a highly unusual form of protest in Japan. Constitutional change . The Abe administration has imminent plans to ""reinterpret"" the postwar document to allow for a greater military role overseas. Currently, Japan's constitution, signed into effect following the Second World War, allows for self-defense but does not authorize military action outside Japan. The changes would allow the Japanese Self Defense Force to engage in collective defense, which includes deploying soldiers internationally to defend the interests of Japanese allies. The government's proposal is expected to gain cabinet approval on July 1st after an agreement is finalized between Japan's main ruling parties, despite polls that say a majority of Japanese citizens oppose the measure. The timeframe is under scrutiny, with many wary that the changes are being pushed through too quickly. Supporters of the proposal say that it creates another, strategically important, buttress against increasing Chinese hegemony in the region. But opponents -- both domestically and abroad -- oppose the change to Article 9 of the document, which states ""the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes."" The proposed change to the wording has also worried Japan's neighbors, who see the hawkish Abe as largely unrepentant for what most Asians view as war crimes committed by Japanese troops during the Second World War. The premier's visit to the controversial Yasukuni shrine in December 2013 was criticized by some neighboring countries.","Man sets himself on fire near busy Tokyo train station in apparent protest .

"(CNN) -- Liz Lee is not your typical MTV reality show star. As friend Jake Fogelnest puts it, ""While (the ""Jersey Shore"" cast) is out fist-pumping, Liz is in her dorm room watching Netflix."" Lee's show, ""My Life as Liz,"" chronicled the self-described nerd's senior year of high school in Texas during its first season last year. Its second season, centering around Lee's time in college in New York, premiered February 8 at 11 p.m. ET, with an 89% increase in viewership from the series premiere, according to MTV. ""The executives at MTV are really smart. The fact that a show like that is on now is amazing and great,"" said Fogelnest, who hosted his own show on MTV as a teenager (from his bedroom, no less), ""Squirt TV,"" in the mid-1990s. ""My Life as Liz"" is ""the one thing where someone's not pregnant or drunk; it's what real people are like."" The show has quickly amassed a big following on Twitter -- not just the hundreds of thousands who follow Lee and her co-stars, but in Twitter feeds like ""@thelizalliance."" More than 1.8 million people have viewed a clip of the most memorable moment from the show on Youtube, in which a nervous Lee stepped in front of a microphone at a talent show and blew everyone away with her singing. Like many MTV reality shows, it's not without its share of controversy. Its detractors have criticized its level of ""reality."" For the record, Lee told CNN, ""The people, the places, they're all real. All the people on the show, I actually know them, and we actually have relationships."" MTV also told the Los Angeles Times last year that neither the terms ""reality show"" nor ""sitcom"" fully captured the show. But ""My Life as Liz"" is unique for another criticism that has been leveled against the show's star: ""My nerd cred is attacked all the time. People think that that was fabricated by MTV. That's the hardest rumor for me to deal with."" During its first season, one anonymous message board posting, especially, claimed that Lee fell in with her school's geeky crowd as a way to remain ""cool"" after losing favor with the popular students, and even alleged that she didn't know who Luke Skywalker was. ""When people (online) say, 'You're not a real nerd,' "" said Lee, ""I'm sitting in my room with shelves overflowing with stacks of comic books."" Benjamin Nugent, author of ""American Nerd,"" noted, ""When you have people choosing to be nerds, questions of authenticity can come up. Before, you had no choice to be a nerd. Now that it's an acceptable option, you can accuse someone of being that way just to be cool. When it was uncool, you never had to worry about authenticity."" As a reflection of the rest of pop culture, something it has captured for nearly 30 years, MTV has embraced geeks in a big way (the sitcom ""The Hard Times of RJ Berger"" will start its second season soon, and there's even a site called ""MTV Geek"" now). In fact, even though MTV means ""Jersey Shore,"" ""Teen Mom"" or ""The Real World"" to most, it has had its moments over the years of standing up for nerds (""Squirt TV"" among them). ""Liz"" something of a sister show to ""The Paper."" The show evolved from what would have been a second season of that show, which had focused on journalism geek Amanda Lorber. It's also a cousin to ""Made,"" MTV's long-running series where someone, usually someone who is socially awkward, gets coached into improving something in their life, whether it be working up the nerve to ask out their crush or becoming an athlete or a hip hop dancer. The network's best known example of a nerd -- a fellow nerd girl, no less -- is ""Daria,"" the animated spinoff of ""Beavis and Butt-Head,"" which started in 1997 and lasted for five seasons. Lee herself sees Daria as an inspiration. ""Daria made it cool to be a smart chick,"" said writer Jennifer Vineyard, who worked at MTV for eight years. ""Just the presence of people or characters like Daria help make it cool to be yourself. There's a tendency for young girls to play dumb. Characters like Daria show you that you don't have to."" MTV's dabbling in nerd culture goes back even further, however. Adam Curry was a VJ for the network for seven years as it made its transition away from only playing music videos. Around the time he started in the late 1980s, Toby Radloff was a special correspondent for the network. Those who have seen the movie ""American Splendor,"" or read the comic book it was based on, might remember Radloff having adopted the title ""genuine nerd."" ""He was completely real,"" said Curry. ""It was just something completely weird and different, that in a way it made so much sense to use him."" Curry, who considers himself a geek -- he registered the MTV.com domain before most people knew what such a thing even meant, then went on to become an early adopter to podcasts -- sees ""My Life as Liz"" as similar to other reality shows. ""The objective gives the viewer the illusion that they can be famous. 'Hey, it's OK to be a nerd, you can be famous. You're a pregnant teenager? Hey, you can be famous.' Nerd culture has exploded because nerds can be successful."" Then there's the show that introduced ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" to the world, ""Liquid Television,"" an anthology of experimental animation that aired in the 1990s that appealed to animation buffs. ""MTV has always experimented with alternative forms of programming,"" said Curry. ""I believe they were running 'Monty Python' in ('Liquid Television's') slot. Here's something different and irreverent, and the rights were cheap. When Mike Judge (Beavis and Butt-Head' creator) came on the scene, it was pure genius at the time."" MTV recently announced that ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" are returning to the network in some form: Can ""Daria"" be far behind? Two other memorable shows that were launched off the success of ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" in the 1990s were ""Aeon Flux"" and ""The Maxx,"" both series with tremendous appeal among hardcore comic book and animation fans. ""'The Maxx' was one of the best comic book adaptations ever made. All of that kind of stuff has been a great part of MTV's history,"" said Rick Marshall, editor of MTV's Splash Page, a blog devoted to comic books and comic book adaptations. Marshall has been in charge of the blog nearly from its inception almost 2½ years ago. ""What's been amazing has been the ability to give comic books and creators the same level of promotion and attention that you do the actors and directors,"" he said. In just these last couple of years, Marshall has seen a change in the way comic books have been accepted. ""I can actually have conversations with significantly more people about 'Green Lantern' and people will actually know what I'm talking about,"" he said. ""I love that I can go on the subway, and people are reading 'The Walking Dead.'"" Marshall said that the success of Splash Page shows that ""this audience is actually important,"" and he sees MTV having recognized that as well with ""My Life as Liz."" ""(MTV was) able to take fan culture and market a show specifically to it,"" said Nugent. ""If you tap into the market of people at fan conventions, they're really loyal to an entertainment product when you market it to them."" Nugent also pointed out, ""Because it's now being put on MTV, teenagers are seeing it as more acceptable. I'm surprised how many kids come up to me and introduce themselves as geeks.""","MTV's ""My Life as Liz,"" about a self-described nerd, has taken off on Twitter .

"When Raju the elephant was rescued after being shackled and abused for five decades, the story and picture of him ""crying"" went viral. His rescuers say he apparently cried first while he was still in his captor's custody. His rescuers describe the tears as ""gushes of liquid"" coming out of his eyes, pouring down both cheeks. They say he looked like he was in a lot of pain. ""It was a very emotional moment for us, because we've never seen an elephant cry like that,"" says Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of Wildlife SOS. ""He was weeping."" The rescue occured in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh state, on July 4. Video and images were published three days later and have since registered well over a million views on YouTube. Even though a team of 10 wildlife experts and 30 enforcement officers were involved in Raju's rescue, it took eight hours to free the malnourished elephant. Satyanarayan says the shackles, laden with spikes, were tied so tightly around Raju's wounded legs that after they unchained him, he cried again. This time, they appeared to be tears of joy. ""I don't know how scientific this is, but it seemed like he understood that we were there to help him,"" Satyanarayan said. Different owners, repeated cruelty . It is not known whether elephants can cry, but experts say they're known to be emotional animals. But Raju's story goes far beyond the tears he shed, whether of pain or joy; it puts the spotlight on a much larger animal-rights issue in India. Raju's rescuers believe he was poached soon after he was born, and that he was sold again and again. He may have had up to 27 owners. They believe Raju was beaten severely, and say the weapons used against him look like they belong in a torture chamber. He was even speared. The idea was to ""show the elephant who is boss,"" says Geeta Seshamani, another Wildlife SOS co-founder. Raju was forced to work as a ""begging prop"" -- on the side of the road, at temples -- and sometimes was rented out for weddings and other celebrations. All the while, his rescuers allege, he was kept in line with beatings and starvation. Tradition is a huge obstacle . It is illegal to trade or commercially exploit elephants in India, but the practice is common. Since 2011, India-based Wildlife SOS has rescued 11 elephants subjected to torture. They've also rescued thousands of captive bears, leopards and monkeys. Still, there are more than 3,000 elephants still living in captivity in India. Seshamani says the biggest challenge is changing the people's mindset; tradition is a grounds for justifying every kind of cruelty against captive elephants. The animals have been used in Indian weddings as a vehicle for the groom. They also are kept in temples as representations of the Hindu elephant god Ganesh. ""It is ironic that Indians worship the elephant god, the monkey god ... but when it comes to protecting animals, the majority don't understand,"" Satyanarayan says. And, in a country of 1.2 billion people, many of whom live in poverty, animal rights have yet to become a priority. Raju is now healing from his wounds and getting care among the other rescued elephants. A veterinarian said an elephant Raju's age and size should weigh between 4,500 and 4,800 kilos (around 5 tons), but Raju is only half that weight. While many of the elephants can move around freely, experts say it will take years for Raju to learn to accept the kindness of human beings. But for now, at last, he's free.

"With elections scheduled for August, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan needs this year to be better than the last. But just six months after the damaging Gezi Park protests, the Turkish government is now engulfed in a wide-ranging anti-corruption probe. Police have so far detained more than 50 high-profile suspects, including the sons of three ministers, a real estate tycoon, a mayor and the chief executive of a major state bank. Erdogan has reacted furiously to the allegations, repeating accusations about an international conspiracy that seeks to undermine the stability of Turkey. Hundreds of senior police officers have been sacked or reassigned and the prosecution team has been reshuffled to impede the course of the investigation. The Prime Minister has also removed four ministers tainted by the scandal from their posts and now seems to be laying the path for the retrial of military officers sentenced in coup plot cases known as Ergenekon and Sledgehammer. Read more: Turkey purges police force . On the surface, the whirlwind of current events appears to expose a government soft on graft and influence peddling. In reality, the allegations have less to do with justice and probity, and more to do with a clash of interests between Erdogan and Fethullah Gulen, a reclusive Pennsylvania-based Islamic preacher and one-time Erdogan ally against the military and secular establishment. The Gulen movement controls over a hundred schools worldwide, media assets, a bank and diverse businesses, and reputedly has many sympathisers in the judiciary, police and intelligence services. Read more: Turkey -- corruption or power struggle with cleric? The timing of the corruption allegations is not coincidental. They come ahead of local elections in March, followed by presidential elections in August in which Erdogan plans to run. He needs to achieve an overwhelming victory in the March elections and, in particular, must win Ankara and Istanbul to stamp his authority on the Turkish general elections expected in June 2015. It is too early to tell whether Erdogan has suffered any loss of popularity. Ultimately, his staying power will depend on the state of the Turkish economy at the time of each respective election. The Erdogan-Gulen trench war is defined by three factors that reflect broader developments. Firstly, Erdogan comes from a Muslim Brotherhood tradition, favoring pan-Muslim solidarity and party politics. Gulen, on the other hand, is an Anatolian group rooted in Turkish nationalism and focused on social and religious activities. These differing traditions, unlike the experience in Arab countries, have ensured a functional separation and conflicting objectives between political Islam and Islamic social movements. The conservative instincts in much of Turkish society, such as an excessive respect for authority at the expense of individual rights, provide fertile ground for Islamic groups to flourish and for conspiracy theories to take hold. According to a recent poll by Ersin Kalaycioglu and Ali Carkoglu, two of Turkey's leading sociologists, many Turks retain a rural and religious outlook rather than a modern urban perspective prevalent in thriving cities such as London, Paris, New York and Tokyo. In such a setting, personalities tend to trump rule-based institutions and governance, meritocracy is sacrificed for personal connections and interpersonal trust is seriously undermined. No wonder that the media coverage of the anti-corruption investigation has focused principally on two individuals and has ignored the concerns of the Turkish public. 'Middle Income trap' This conservatism is a critical obstacle to the advancement of democracy and the future prosperity of the Turkish economy and prevents the necessary political, economic and social reforms. In the absence of these reforms, a slow growth regime -- sometimes referred to as a ""Middle Income trap"" -- is taking hold. As I discussed in a recent Chatham House report, growth rates of 3% or lower will become the norm rather than the exception. It is no surprise that the start of the Erdogan-Gulen feud began in 2011, when Turkey's rapid growth rate was beginning its decline. Whatever the outcome of the ongoing saga, the seeds of division have been implanted in the informal Islamic coalition between Erdogan supporters and the Gulenists. Reconciliation, though possible, will be increasingly complicated by economic stagnation. Political turmoil may be the outcome in the short-term, but perhaps it may presage the eventual transformation of Turkey into a more robust and stable democracy as this turmoil encourages Turks toward more transparency and stronger institutions.

"(CNN) -- He has sculpted a new career, much to the relief of his body. Where once it was concussions and broken bones Philip Blacker had to contend with, now the former British jockey works with clay molds and bronze casts. To the casual racegoer, the 64-year-old sculptor's work will already be well known -- his trademark life-size models of celebrated racehorses are dotted around racecourses, stables and the homes of wealthy horse owners across England and the world.Â . ""Racing was my first love,"" he says of a 13-year-old riding career, which included 340 winners and in which he came close to winning the prestigious Grand National. Now he is consumed by a love of art. His latest exhibition is a series of bronze friezes, which also feature a number of horses, though with a more somber theme in bearing witness to World War I's 100th anniversary. Entitled ""Farewell, Leicester Square"" the friezes capture the horrors of that conflict in graphic detail. Before discovering a gift for sculpture, Blacker initially struggled to adjust to life out of the saddle, missing the adrenalin fix the sport had given him. ""You name it, I tried it -- all sorts of dangerous things,"" recalls Blacker, ""jumping out of an airplane, riding motorcycles very fast, that sort of thing. ""It was about five years of trying to seek a substitute but it wore off."" So the former art student, who realized an aptitude for sculpting during the latter part of his jockey career, began to pursue the discipline more seriously after finally hanging up his silks. ""The sculpture is exciting in a similar way -- it's like itching for a ride, the way you want to get into a studio if a piece of work is going well,"" he explains. ""When you're into a work it's mesmerizing. It's your total focus -- that's the same for a four-minute horse race to sculpture being a slow-motion version."" Blacker's first big work was a life-sized version of three-time National winner Red Rum in 1988 which still takes pride of place at Aintree Racecourse. He has also sculpted Desert Orchid, the famous gray steeplechaser, for Kempton Park Racecourse, as well as former Kentucky Derby winner Northern Dancer for Woodbine in Canada. Red Rum was a horse which in some ways defines Blacker's two lives. In 1973, Blacker finished fourth on Spanish Steps as Red Rum won the National for the first time, while four years later he rode Happy Ranger to seventh in 1977 as the heralded bay gelding sealed a third victory over the Aintree fences. Red Rum became something of a sporting celebrity in the British psyche, not falling in 100 races, and his third win is regarded as one of the greatest moments in British sporting history. An event often referred to as the ""the ultimate test of a horse's courage"" and the richest jump race in Europe with a prize fund of Â£1 million ($1.6 million) -- the Grand National is tinged with frustration for Blacker. He believes he could and should have won the race in 1982 on board favorite Royal Mail. But the day before, against the advice of his trainer, he went to ride at Ludlow, only to fall at the last fence of the final race of the day. It ended with him being taken to hospital with a broken shoulder and, in his absence the next day, Royal Mail fell at Becher's Brook. ""That horse needed a rider that knew him and on that day he didn't, so I really saw that as my one big chance to win the race,"" says Blacker, who placed in the top four on three occasions at Aintree. ""But stupidly I threw it away. It's one of the biggest regrets of my life."" The National is a race he loved, one he rode well and one where he embraced the potential perils, falling to the turf for four of his nine rides in the race. ""I had too much fun,"" says Blacker as he looks back on his career. ""When I look at a jockey like Tony McCoy -- notorious for his relentless pursuit for riding perfection -- perhaps I wasn't as dedicated as I might have been. There were missed opportunities, I could have done better."" Instead with Red Rum and his other equine creations, Blacker has become the McCoy of equine sculpture, successfully allowing his initial passion to still live on through his art work. Each one is created initially from a 1/16th-size model made of wire with clay molded around it before ironing out any issues. That then becomes a life-size model, with about three-quarters of a ton of clay used before the foundry comes in to take molds and the cast before the final creation is set in bronze. Blacker's latest show is perhaps a nod to his father, Cecil Blacker, a former general in the British Army, who also passed on his equine passion as a show jumper and steeplechaser to his son. His son, however, was unaware of his father's military exploits until reading his 1993 autobiography. Blacker Sr. was the recipient of the Military Cross, one of only 50,000 ever awarded, in his case for his role in the three-day Operation Goodwood against Nazi forces in Normandy in 1944. He was later General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in Northern Ireland just before the start of ""The Troubles"" -- bloody conflict between Irish republicans and the British government that began in the late 1960s until the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. In 1974, Blacker's father's home was badly damaged by an IRA bomb. ""I read about that but honestly I can't remember anything about it at the time,"" admits his son. ""It's bad but I was so busy trying to ride winners that I don't think I paid too much interest. ""He kept that sort of thing quiet. Of course, I realized he might be a target as a high-ranking officer but, really, that incident passed me by."" Blacker's military friezes are made in bronze with a patina (or thin layer of chemical on top) which is blow-torched, thereby causing a reaction that changes the color of the metal, producing haunting images. Further inspiration was derived by an earlier commission from former jockey and now journalist Brough Scott to depict Warrior, a famous military horse. Scott had once tried to persuade Blacker to give up riding after yet another crash, and move into art full-time. ""He didn't listen, carried on and finished third in the 1981 Grand National,"" recalls Scott. ""In fact, that year the top three jockeys I'd advised all of them to pack it in. What do I know, hey?"" Scott argues his good friend was perhaps initially overshadowed by Sir Cecil, who was knighted in 1969. ""It was difficult as his father was this amazing overachiever -- he had a picture in the Royal Academy, an article in the Spectator and rode a winner at Sandown all in the same week,"" Scott says. ""So initially I think Philip went the other way, a bit of an underachiever. But actually he's rather extraordinary -- he became a thoroughly good jockey and then the sculpting. He kept that to himself initially and his latest exhibition is wonderful, really quite daring. ""I remember his son getting into music so he decided to take up the saxophone and taught himself. Now he's very accomplished."" Blacker's artistic pathway has not been without its troubles -- his studio has twice suffered from nearby fires. In the first, his work was untouched, but in the second molds which had taken weeks to create make were ruined. Recently relocated to Wiltshire in the southwest of England, such fires are hopefully a thing of the past but when most are ready for retirement, Blacker, having gone from Grand National to grand designs, has no plans to call it quits. ""I'm a workaholic so I can't,"" he says, driven by making his next piece of art better than the last. Casting his mind three decades back, retirement from riding was something a relief, the pressure of having to make racing weight of 64 kilograms no longer a requirement, nor having to contend with a litany of injuries: four broken wrists, a fractured femur and all manner of concussions. Becher's Brook -- that famous Grand National fence -- is no longer the driving force, more Flanders Fields. ""Farewell, Leicester Square"" is on show at London's Thompson Gallery from November 6-15.","Philip Blacker rode horses for over a decade, now he sculpts them in life-size models .

"When I was growing up in Iraq, math was an everyday part of life. My parents instilled in me a passion for discovery, and they never made a distinction between science and creativity. We would play with math problems just as we would play with pens and paper to draw -- math was like sketching. In my teens, my family would go to London each summer, visiting the many art galleries and museums, including the Science Museum. I am forever grateful to my parents for introducing me to art and science in a way that drew no boundaries between them. The teachers who taught sciences in the school I went to as a young girl in Baghdad were all professors from the university, so the standards of science courses were really incredible. The headmistress was deeply committed to the education of women and understood that STEM subjects must be taught in a way connects their inherent creativity and relationships with the real world, rather than dry data to be memorized and regurgitated on standardized tests. There is a definite connection between the logic of math and architecture -- so much of the work we are doing in our office comes from my fascination with mathematical logic and geometry. Huge advances in design technology are enabling us to rethink form and space, and the wonderfully fluid surfaces and structures of each project are defined by scientific innovations. Our design for the new Mathematics Gallery at London's Science Museum will convey these seemingly abstract concepts into an inspiring interactive experience for all visitors. There are many successful women working in STEM - but there are not nearly enough. Women have made tremendous contributions -- and we must celebrate their success. When teaching at universities, many of my best students are women, but they sometimes lack confidence. I believe education at all levels is critical. As a woman, education gives you the confidence to conquer the next step and make exciting new discoveries.

"A man lies dead; his severely emaciated body makes the rib cage protruding from his midsection look violent and sharp. A child sits in the dirt, the closed storefront behind him spray-painted with the words ""I swear to God I am hungry.""  The lifeless body of a baby lies discolored and wrapped in a white sheet. These are a few of the pictures activists have posted on social media pages from the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, just 6 miles from central Damascus. The first to die from starvation at the camp was 4-year old Abdelhay Youssef on November 2, activists say. Since then, at least 43 more people have died from a lack of food and medical supplies at the camp -- 28 from starvation, said the Palestine Association for Human Rights in Syria, which has gathered and posted the names of the dead. The camp has been cut off from aid since November 2013 and engulfed in fighting between the government and rebel forces since December 2012, when the Free Syrian Army rebel group gained control of the area but the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad controlled the entrances. In late 2012, the Free Syrian Army clashed with the pro-Assad leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command, which had run the camp. The regime still maintains control of camp entrances, and armed groups fighting near the entrances have prevented aid from entering. Syria talks off to 'good beginning,' U.N. mediator says . 'We are dying, slowly' ""Today is the 180th day that food has not been allowed in Yarmouk,"" activist and resident who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed said. ""We had food when it started, and it (has run out) since then."" People are now surviving on water boiled with herbs, he said, or families sharing a cup of rice with their neighbors. ""We are dying, slowly,"" he said. ""Just today, three people tried to go to an empty field to eat grass from the ground, and they were shot by snipers,"" he said, his voice rising in frustration. ""If you can imagine -- people are dying just to eat grass."" Another picture from the camp shows stalks of cactus that activists say are being sold for 500 Syrian pounds ($3.50). The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, has tried to give food and other aid to camp residents ""amid reports of widespread malnutrition in Yarmouk, amid reports of women dying during childbirth because of shortages of medical care, amid reports of children eating animal feed to survive,"" said Chris Gunness, a spokesman for the agency. Their attempts have been unsuccessful. On Monday, aid trucks had to retreat after the Syrian government told the convoy to enter from the camp's southern entrance, where heavy gunfire prevented it from proceeding. In a video posted on YouTube, a young man who appears to be a teenager cries hysterically: ""(A kilogram) of rice costs 10,000 Syrian pounds ($70)! We don't have enough! We have nothing to do with either side (of the fighting)! We want to eat and drink! We want to be safe! Have mercy on us!"" According to estimates from the UNRWA, there were 160,000 Palestinian refugees in the Yarmouk camp before the fighting began, and 18,000 remain. Opinion: U.S., forget about ousting al-Assad . It's difficult to leave . For residents who can afford to leave, their Palestinian refugee status makes travel very difficult. ""Our passports are Syrian-Palestinian passports. We can leave Syria, but we can't enter Palestine. Even if we could (leave the camp), we cannot go to Turkey without a visa, and Jordan will never let us in. We cannot go to Iraq. To go to Europe, we need visas. We have no embassies in Syria, but Lebanon will not let us in unless we have already a visa (to somewhere else), since we are only allowed a 48-hour transit visa in Lebanon,"" Abu Mohammed said. Yarmouk has seen widespread cases of ""malnutrition and the absence of medical care, including for those who have severe conflict-related injuries, and including for women in childbirth, with fatal consequences for some women. Residents including infants and children are subsisting for long periods on diets of stale vegetables, herbs, powdered tomato paste, animal feed and cooking spices dissolved in water,"" Gunness said. ""The hijacking of Yarmouk camp in Damascus by armed groups that have practiced and still practice methodical terrorism constitutes a war crime against humanity,"" Palestinian Labor Minister Ahmad Majdalani said on a visit to Damascus, according to the Syrian state-run SANA news agency. ""There has been an appalling absence of electricity and heating for horrendously long periods, now close to one year, with all (that) this implies for poor health. Residents are having to rely on going out on terraces and burning furniture and branches to warm themselves in the open because wood fires cannot be resorted to indoors,"" Gunness said. ""The scale of the crisis in Syria, with millions of civilians affected, is staggering and the humanitarian response insufficient,"" Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said Monday, at the end of a three-day visit to the country. ""We are under the control of the FSA, and they need to fight for us, to break this siege,"" said Abu Mohammed, the camp resident and activist. ""If they aren't fighting for us, they should leave."" The camp ""remains a place where extreme human suffering in primitively harsh conditions is the norm for Palestinian and Syrian civilians living there. I emphasize that the imperative remains that Syrian authorities and other parties must allow and facilitate safe and open humanitarian access into Yarmouk to enable us to assist civilians trapped there,"" Gunness said.","The Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp is just 6 miles from central Damascus .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. officials are considering what could happen to 15 alleged Somali pirates held on the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier following the killings of four Americans who were sailing around the world on a private yacht. Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan referred questions on possible prosecution of the Somalis to the Department of Justice as well as to the FBI, which is heading the investigation off the coast of Somalia focused on the 58-foot-yacht Quest that was seized by pirates last week. ""They'll be detained until the Justice Department makes a determination about possible prosecution,"" Lapan said. ""The process is going on now to determine where they'll be prosecuted."" Justice Department officials who will decide where and when the alleged pirates will be prosecuted were tight-lipped Wednesday, but one senior law enforcement official acknowledged the transfer of the suspects to the FBI for a trial in the United States will occur ""soon."" Two officials indicated the suspects would be tried in a U.S. civilian court, but declined to say where. In previous cases involving Somali pirates and American vessels, the trials for suspects turned over from the Navy to the FBI were held in Norfolk, Virginia, and New York City. According to U.S. officials, the four Americans -- ship owners Jean and Scott Adam, along with Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle -- were found shot after U.S. forces boarded the Quest early Tuesday. All died from their wounds. The Quest was being shadowed by four U.S. warships after pirates seized it off the coast of Oman on Friday. U.S. forces responded after a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at a U.S. Navy ship about 600 yards away -- and missed -- and the sound of gunfire could be heard on board the Quest, according to U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Mark Fox. The killings signal escalating violence by Somali pirates who have increased torture and attacks on hostages in a bid to speed up the process of getting ransom money, said a spokesman for the European Union Naval Force combating the piracy. What started several years ago as local piracy by Somali fishermen has been taken over by organized-crime elements that are well-armed and intent on cashing in on a lucrative operation, according to Wing Commander Paddy O'Kennedy of EU NAVFOR. ""It was a real surprise to us that they had done this. Normally, that's their income,"" O'Kennedy said, calling the pirates' killing of hostages ""literally shooting the hen that lays the golden eggs."" John Campbell, a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria now with the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, said the Somali piracy was evolving ""into a grotesque form of something like a big business."" International naval forces, including participation by the United States and the European Union, have managed to reduce piracy in the Gulf of Aden off Somalia, a key shipping route, Campbell noted. Now the pirates are operating in open waters farther away, making international monitoring and protection more difficult, Campbell said. ""All of this would indicate that ending or controlling Somali piracy is no longer, if it ever was, purely a naval operation,"" he said. Campbell called for a broader approach, including international law enforcement and judicial procedures, anti-corruption forces and international development agencies to work on land as well as on the water. ""You cannot just simply snap your fingers and solve this,"" Campbell said. ""It is not a case of sending an aircraft carrier to the horn of Africa. It's a real international conundrum."" Earlier, Lapan said it was too early to say if the killing of the four Americans would bring a change to U.S. policy or tactics regarding the Somali pirates. O'Kennedy, however, noted the increasing use of violence by pirates against hostages indicated a change in their tactics. ""These guys want money, they want it now, and they're prepared to do whatever it takes to force the companies to pay up"" right away, O'Kennedy said. ""We've seen a rise in violence toward hostages at a relatively kind of steady increase,"" he said, noting the torture reports and now the killings. Of reports of hostages being tortured on several vessels, O'Kennedy said: ""It wasn't kind of rough treatment; it was pretty systematic torture."" Campbell said shipping companies, their insurers, governments patrolling the waters off of Somalia and others already are confronting the ""huge"" cost of piracy. Now the increased threat to hostages raises the stakes even further, he said. ""Obviously it's going to be a concern to any government that cares about its citizens,"" Campbell said, later adding: ""The concern would be that if ransoms aren't paid, they'll kill."" Officials said there were 19 pirates in total in the seizing of the Quest. Two were found dead on board by U.S. special forces members, who killed two more while clearing the vessel. Thirteen others were captured and detained, along with two more who had earlier gone to a U.S. Navy ship to negotiate. The pirates were believed to have boarded the Quest after traveling on a ""mother ship."" The ""mother ship"" trend -- pirates using another hijacked merchant vessel -- has appeared in the past few months, said Cyrus Mody, manager at the International Maritime Bureau in London. According to Mody, the mother ships provide pirates with ""a lot more reach, a lot more capability to move out (farther) into the Indian Ocean."" In addition, he said, pirates can stay on board longer, have appropriate equipment and can demand the expertise of the ship's crew. Previously, pirates typically hijacked a vessel and held it until a ransom was paid, Mody said. So far in 2011, ""we have already seen more than 50 attacks carried out,"" by Somali pirates,"" Mody said. In April 2009, pirates seized the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama, leading to a standoff in the Indian Ocean. U.S. forces moved to rescue American Captain Richard Phillips after seeing a pirate aiming a weapon at his back, officials said at the time. Three pirates were killed and one was arrested. The Somali man arrested was convicted of acts related to high-seas piracy, and a federal court in New York sentenced him last week to more than 30 years in prison. As of February 15, pirates were holding 33 vessels and 712 hostages, according to the International Maritime Bureau. The Adams were from Marina del Rey, California, while Macay and Riggle were from Seattle, Washington. The four had been traveling with yachts participating in the Blue Water Rally since their departure from Phuket, Thailand, rally organizers said. The group, which organizes long-distance group cruises, said the Quest broke off on February 15 after leaving Mumbai, India, to take a different route. CNN's Mike Pearson, Ashley Hayes, Carol Cratty, Terry Frieden, David McKenzie and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","U.S. officials are holding 15 suspects in the killing of four Americans .

"(CNN)Britain's Princess Anne and 10-time major winner Annika Sorenstam are among the first women members to be admitted to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, it was announced Tuesday. The club, which is renowned as the home of golf, voted last September to end its male-only membership rule, breaking with a 260-year tradition. Princess Anne, who is also a member of the International OIympic Committee, and Sweden's Sorenstam, were granted honorary membership status. The other five to be honored, Britons Laura Davies and Belle Robertson, Americans Renee Powell and Louise Suggs and Lally Segard of France, have played and enjoyed success at the highest levels of competitive golf. ""This is a historic day for golf,"" George Macgregor, the captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R&A), told its official website. ""They are extremely worthy additions to our roll of honorary members and will become ambassadors for the club as they have been for the sport of golf throughout their careers."" Princess Anne, the only daughter of reigning monarch Queen Elizabeth II, joins three other members of the British royal family in becoming an honorary member of the R&A. The club, founded in 1754, organizes golf's oldest major, the British Open, and also administers the rules of the sport from its famous headquarters in St Andrews in Scotland. It was also announced Tuesday that an unspecified number of lay women members had also been granted membership with more set to follow in the coming months. The R&A had come under increasing pressure to admit women members, with former British prime minister Gordon Brown among leading public figures to voice their concerns on discriminatory grounds. It eventually followed the lead set by the exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in the United States, which admitted its first two female members, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and business leader Darla Moore in August 2012. In the R&A vote last year, 85% of its members backed the move to admit women members in an historic ballot.","R&A announces first women members .

"""The first time you do it you feel a bit nervous, but after two or three times, it becomes normal, like rugby or boxing or any sport."" Fidael Beaf could easily be describing bungee jumping. But the 44-year-old Vanuatuan is talking about something far more terrifying than bouncing on the end of a piece of elastic. Every year from April to June, the Vanuatuan island of Pentecost hosts one of the most spectacular and death-defying cultural ceremonies ever conceived. Known as the Nagol, it sees men climb flimsy 100-foot wooden towers and dive headfirst into empty space, with nothing to break their fall but vines tied their ankles. My journey to meet Beaf and his fellow land jumpers begins on a stifling hot Saturday morning as I board a 17-seat Chinese turboprop in the capital Port Vila. The flight to Pentacost isn't for the easily rattled, though passengers are rewarded with epic views of Benbow and Murim, active volcanoes on the island of Ambryn. An hour later, the pilot touches down at Lenorore, a small runway squeezed between the jungle-clad mountains and volcanic beaches of Pentecost's west coast. Ours is the first of the day's five planes, all bringing in tourists to land at what's more of a concrete bunker than an airport. Organizers say a maximum of 50 tourists are allowed to attend the weekly ceremony to prevent over-commercialization. A portion of every ticket helps pay for children's school fees and church programs. Dysfunctional marriage . Ironically, European missionaries banned land diving on Pentecost in the early 20th century, but the priests never reached the rugged southeast corner of the island, where the ritual was passed on to successive generations. The ritual is said to have its roots in a legend about a dysfunctional marriage. So the story goes, a woman decided to flee into the jungle to escape daily confrontations with her spouse. Hotly pursued by her husband, she ran up a tree then tied a vine around her ankle and jumped from the top, landing safely. The husband followed suit but without the aid of the vine he hit the ground with a fatal splat. Inspired by the woman's act of defiance, the women of Pentecost began land diving for fun. But uneasy with seeing the women dangling from trees in compromising positions, the island's men called an end to their fun and stole the activity for themselves. Over time, land diving moved from trees to purpose-built towers. It's also been transformed into a ritual rife with religious symbolism -- the success of the all-important yam harvest is said to depend on the courage of the previous year's divers. After the last plane touches down, we're shepherded to a clearing in the jungle where the impressive tower known as a ""Nagol Adi"" stands upon a treeless slope. Held together by vines without a single nail or screw, this outwardly phallic shrine takes 30 men up to a month to build. Deadly mistakes . At its center is a lopped tree surrounded by a crisscross of pole scaffolding lashed together and anchored into the earth by vines. Protruding from its face are a dozen diving planks, the lowest of which is for boys who start diving from the age of five. The highest is reserved for the most accomplished, with a successful jump -- one that doesn't cripple or kill the diver -- delivering wads of social capital. Despite its primitive appearance, the Nagol Adi is a marvel of intelligent design. The diving boards are designed to snap and hinge downward to absorb much of the divers' G-force, the wood is freshly cut to ensure strength and vines are carefully tailored to each diver's weight and height. Diving is only permitted in the two months following the wet season to ensure the vines contain the water that lends them elasticity and strength. Adherence to religious customs is also considered essential to a diver's safety. While the tower is being constructed, divers live together in men-only huts and avoid contact with women -- a ritual said to clarify their minds. As belief in sorcery is widespread in Vanuatu, divers are also prohibited from asking witchdoctors to supply them ""love potions"" during this period. On a few occasions when the rules have been bent, it has cost lives. When Britain's Queen Elizabeth II visited Pentecost in February 1974, a diver died when his vine snapped during an out-of-season Nagol  held in her honor. In 2008, Vanuatuan cameraman Hardy Ligo was killed when a poorly constructed tower collapsed under his weight during a Nagol that some said had been held too close to the yam harvest. Breaking wood . The moment the Nagol begins, it becomes apparent why people come from all corners of the world to see it. On a terrace cut into the hill behind the tower, a troupe of about 100 men and boys wearing only penis sheaths begin chanting in Sa, the language of Southern Pentecost. Without warning they break into a dance, stomping their feet intently into the ground as women in grass skirts emerge from the trees, adding their voices to the melee. One of the dancing men emerges from the group, scampers up the tower and finds his way to the lowest diving board. Minutes pass as the frayed ends of two vines are tied around the volunteer's ankles. Below, the chanting and dancing intensifies. Once the vines are secured, the diver spreads his arms wide and calls out for emotional support from the dancers. The crowd's yelps and whistles reach fever pitch, the diver crosses his arms against his chest and makes an incredible leap of faith, trying to put as much distance between himself and the sharp edges of the tower. Braver than bungee . When the vines go taut, the sound of breaking wood cracks through the clearing, as the plank gives way. Instead of bouncing in the air like a bungee jumper, the diver plummets to the ground, skimming his chest on earth that has been heavily tilled to absorb impact. Assistants rush in, pull the diver to his feet and confirm he's in one piece. The crowd roars with approval. Happily, all 12 land divers emerge unscathed on this day -- an unusually good safety record. But the divers remain well aware of the risks. Among them, 33-year-old Michael Olul scornfully dismisses comparisons with thrill seekers who use elastic ropes. ""Bungee is not so brave,"" he says. Few who have seen the Vanuatu land divers in action would argue. Getting there: . Air Taxi Vanuatu (+678 5544 206) offers day tours to see the land divers of Pentecost Island every Saturday in April, May and June for 44,000 vatu ($426). Six-seat Cessna aircraft depart from the capital of Port Vila at 8:30 a.m. and return at 5 p.m. Includes scenic flight over volcanoes, spectator fee for land diving, lunch on Epi Island and chance to swim with rare dugongs, a large marine mammal related to manatees.

"(CNN) -- If golf has a reputation for being a bit stuffy, then the Bryan brothers and their trick shots are a much-needed blast of fresh air. Hailing from South Carolina, George and younger brother Wesley have been attracting a growing band of followers with a colorful array of videos. From casually shooting hoops with a wedge to smashing shots from mid-air in the dark, the siblings are hoping to show off golf in a new light and attract a younger generation of players back to the sport. ""We love golf, but most people think it's kind of boring,"" George Bryan told CNN. ""We're providing something that's a little different. We're bringing a kind of hip, fun way to view golf and hope that it brings in a younger demographic. We want them to say: 'That's fun, I wanna go try the game',"" the 26-year-old added. Both brothers are qualified professionals and started filming trick shots as a hobby earlier this year, but it has quickly grown into a mini-industry after racking up tens of thousands of clicks on their website and YouTube. ""Most of the tricks are done on the fly,"" explains 24-year-old Wesley, who smashes the balls set up by George. ""A lot of them work on the first or second try. If the ball comes into my hit zone then it normally goes pretty quick -- a lot quicker than what people say on the comments board,"" he added. The pair started out experimenting at Woodcreek & Wildewood, their local club in state capital Columbia, but have since diversified their content. In the summer, a football-themed ""World Cup edition"" celebrated this year's tournament in Brazil and collaborations with basketball trick shot specialists ""The Legendary Shots"" and pro golfer and model Blair O'Neal have widened their appeal. The brothers are not the only trick shot artists to showcase their skills online. French golf professional, Romain Bechu's incredible ball-juggling skills has received over half-a-million views on YouTube and British trick shot specialist David Edwards has performed his routine at dozens of pro events including the Open Championship and the Ryder Cup. When the Bryan brothers are not dreaming up new routines, they compete on the National Golf Association (NGA) Pro Golf Tour and the Web.com Tour, a developmental tour for the main PGA Tour -- which is where the pair hope to end up playing one day. ""The goal is really to use this to help our pro golf careers out, but at the same time we view this as a hobby, we both enjoy it,"" George says. ""And when we do have an off week, it's good to get out minds off tournament golf and there's no better outlet to be creative than trying some trick shots out and seeing how far we can take it.""

"Arlington, Texas (CNN) -- A deep freeze across the South appears to have dampened the pre-Super Bowl fun for fans gathering in the Lone Star State.

But former Super Bowl MVP Kurt Warner called the city ""unprepared"" to handle the nation's biggest sporting event in the wintry weather. ""When you drive around here right now, there's nothing going on,"" Warner said. ""It's like the city is dead, which you don't expect Super Bowl week."" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was a bit more diplomatic, saying the city faced ""a few challenges that we didn't expect, weather-wise."" The big game will be played in Cowboys Stadium -- a domed arena with a retractable roof. Ice and snow slid off the stadium roof Friday and caused injuries to workers below, authorities said. Gusty winds on the south side of the stadium sent ice falling up to 50-60 feet from the stadium, striking contract employees, according to fire department officials. One man was struck in the head by ice and was in stable condition at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, said Lt. Pedro Arevalo of the Arlington Fire Department. Five other men and women had minor injuries, he said. All stadium entrances have been closed except for an adjacent truck tunnel, which workers and visitors will exit through as a precaution, said NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy. ""The ice should be melted off tomorrow,"" Arevalo told CNN Friday night, describing the hard freeze as extremely unusual. While Dallas Fort Worth Airport was open, although with reduced traffic, neighboring Love Field Airport in Dallas was closed until Friday afternoon, officials said. Flights later resumed. In Dallas, icy roads forced schools and some government offices to close earlier this week, said mayoral spokesman Frank Librio, who appeared undeterred by the weather. ""We have been planning for this for a whole year,"" Librio said of Sunday's match-up between the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers.  ""We'll be ready."" Both teams and their fans are cold weather clubs, accustomed to the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Heinz Field in Pittsburgh. Forecasters say the sub-freezing temperatures are likely to be gone by game day, when a high of 44 degrees is expected. While the weather outside won't exactly be balmy, the day might be remembered fondly three years from now. The New Meadowlands Stadium, co-owned by the New York Giants and the Jets, won the bid to host Super Bowl XLVIII in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Fans may then be forced to don winter gloves underneath their giant foam fingers while inside the open-air stadium in what could be the first true cold-weather Super Bowl. The big game has always been played in either domed stadiums or traditionally warm-weather states. The 1967 ""Ice-Bowl,"" in which Green Bay eked out a 21-17 win over the Dallas Cowboys in the 35th National Football League championship game, was played amid teeth-chattering temperatures at Lambeau Field. The Packers then traveled to the warmer climate of Miami to defeat the Oakland Raiders 33-14 in Super Bowl II. Sunday's game, Super Bowl XLV, is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m ET. CNN's Ed Lavandera and Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Ice and snow sliding off Cowboys stadium cause several injuries .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- A justice of the peace in Louisiana who has drawn widespread criticism for refusing to issue a marriage license to an interracial couple says he has no regrets about his decision. Keith Bardwell says he has no regrets for denying a marriage license to an interracial couple. ""It's kind of hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you haven't done wrong,"" Keith Bardwell told CNN affiliate WAFB on Saturday. Bardwell, a justice of the peace for Tangipahoa Parish's 8th Ward, refused to issue a marriage license to Beth Humphrey, 30, and her boyfriend, Terence McKay, 32, both of Hammond. Bardwell's actions have elicited reactions from some top officials, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who called for Bardwell's dismissal. ""This is a clear violation of constitutional rights and federal and state law. ... disciplinary action should be taken immediately -- including the revoking of his license,"" the Republican governor said Friday. Bardwell has not returned repeated calls from CNN this week. But he told Hammond's Daily Star in a story Thursday that he did not marry the couple because he was concerned for the children who might be born of the relationship and that, in his experience, most interracial marriages don't last. ""I'm not a racist,"" Bardwell told the newspaper. ""I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house. My main concern is for the children."" Bardwell, stressing that he couldn't personally endorse the marriage, said his wife referred the couple to another justice of the peace.  Watch why justice says he nixed interracial marriage » . Humphrey and McKay received their marriage license October 9 from another justice of the peace in the same parish. They have reached out to an attorney to determine their next step, Humphrey said. ""We would like him to resign,"" Beth McKay said. ""He doesn't believe he's being racist, but it is racist."" The National Urban League called for an investigation into the incident by the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, saying in a statement that Bardwell's actions were ""a huge step backward in social justice."" According to the Census Bureau, Tangipahoa Parish is about 70 percent white and 30 percent black. The U.S. Supreme Court tossed out any racially-based limitations on marriage in the landmark 1967 Loving v. Virginia case. In the unanimous decision, the court said that ""Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.""","NEW: ""Hard to apologize when you haven't done wrong,"" justice of peace says .

"Listen to how loud tea party forces are this week and it will remind you of a valuable lesson: for some conservatives, the 2014 wins are likely to translate into more disappointment -- not more power. The big issue -- and the last big act of the current Congress -- is whether lawmakers will pass a spending bill that keeps the government running well into 2015. Some tea party activists insist it is their duty to deny President Obama any funding that would help him implement what they call amnesty -- meaning the administration's recent executive actions on illegal immigration. Related: Obama tells the undocumented to ""come out of the shadows"" Transcript: President Obama's immigration address . In Monday's conservative Red State morning briefing, Item No. 1 is a complaint against the GOP leadership: . ""They preemptively surrendered and now want to both nibble at Obamacare instead of end it and they want to fund the President's immigration plan. House Republicans, this week, are set to fund Barack Obama's amnesty plan with the help of House Democrats. If you want to stop amnesty, you must flood the offices of members of congress with phone calls. There's no other way. They need to hear from you and that you demand they keep their promises."" It's the kind of talk that in the past has put Speaker Boehner on thin ice -- and remember we did have a brief government shutdown not all that long ago because he could not corral -- and control -- the tea party forces. Might that happen again now? The Republican leadership says ""no"" -- and emphatically so. House Speaker John Boehner and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell -- who will be majority leader in a month -- say Republicans cannot shut down the government as a way of making policy points. And they say they begin the week confident they have the votes to prove the tea party forces may be loud, but cant win. Related: GOP aims to avoid shutdown . There will be more Republicans in both the House and Senate come January. So why are tea party forces so frantic about the votes this week? Remember, the GOP establishment candidates won most of the contested Republican primaries this year, part of what McConnell openly called his bid to ""crush"" the tea party. That's why more Republicans in Washington, D.C. next year will not translate into more tea party votes in the big internal GOP battles. To the contrary. So while it would be wrong to consider this week the tea party's last stand -- its forces promise to regroup and recover -- the last big act of the old Congress is going to be very important in setting the tone for the new Congress. The spending votes will establish just how strong Boehner and McConnell are in dealing with the internal GOP rifts that have been so messy in recent years.

"A decomposed body found in Texas near the border with Mexico earlier this month has been identified as an 11-year-old undocumented immigrant from Guatemala, the Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office said Monday. Gilberto Francisco Ramos Juarez was found dead in the brush near La Joya on June 15, authorities said. An autopsy showed no signs of trauma, said J.P. Rodriguez, a spokesman for the sheriff's office. The boy was found wearing pants, a belt and boots. ""The pathologist believes because of the way that we found the body, it had no shirt  ... that's a sign of heatstroke,"" Sheriff Eddie Guerra said, adding that a toxicology report is pending. Rodriguez said it appears the boy strayed from a group that included some relatives, possibly after crossing the Rio Grande. Guerra theorized the boy was ""wandering aimlessly"" through the area. Authorities were able to identify the boy after they discovered a phone number on his belt buckle. A series of calls led them to the boy's father, who described the clothes the boy was wearing. The boy's brother told authorities that Ramos was last seen with an uncle, who had been detained by Border Patrol agents, according to a news release from the sheriff's office. CNN affiliate KRGV reported that the sheriff is still investigating how the boy ended up dead in the bushes and who brought him into the United States. The U.S. government has struggled to process and accommodate an influx of illegal human traffic but specifically a spike in immigrant children. The government doesn't have enough beds, food or sanitary facilities. U.S. authorities estimate between 60,000 to 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year in what the White House is calling an ""immediate humanitarian crisis."" Earlier in June, the White House announced a plan to spend millions in a government-wide response by sending aid to governments in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to help with crime and violence prevention.","Sheriff believes boy became lost, probably died of heat stroke .

"(CNN)A British football team has vowed to support any criminal action brought against its fans who were filmed as they physically stopped a black man from getting on the Paris metro Tuesday. The amateur video obtained by The Guardian, and posted on its website, shows the man make multiple attempts to board a train at Richelieu-Drouot station, only to be pushed away each time by a group of passengers. The group, who appear to be Chelsea supporters, can then be heard chanting: ""We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it."" Chelsea were in France to play Paris Saint-Germain in a Champions League first-leg tie - Europe's premier football tournament -- which finished 1-1. ""Such behavior is abhorrent and has no place in football or society,"" said statement released by Chelsea Wednesday. ""We will support any criminal action against those involved in such behavior, and should evidence point to the involvement of Chelsea season ticket holders or members the club will take the strongest possible action against them including banning orders."" Both French and British police have said they will analyze the footage. ""Police measures were deployed last night for the football match in order to prevent any violence. None occurred,"" French law enforcement told CNN. ""The police department only found out about this incident once the video was uploaded on the internet. ""The prefect then wished for the Chelsea supporters to be identified. The Paris prosecutor has opened an investigation and is now in charge."" A Metropolitan Police statement added: ""We will, of course, assist French authorities to identify the people involved and support them in any action they choose to take."" UEFA, the body which governs European football, said it was appalled by the footage, but as it occurred outside of the stadium it could not take any punitive action. British expatriate Paul Nolan, who CNN was not immediately able to contact, says he filmed the incident on his phone at Richelieu-Drouot station. ""The doors were open and I could see and hear that a lot of chanting was going on,"" Nolan told The Guardian. ""It looked like it was quite aggressive so I just took out by phone to record it. ""He was obviously completely shocked when they pushed him off. I don't think he realised who they were. He then tried to get on again and got pushed off a second time."" Sepp Blatter, the president of football's global governing body FIFA, also took to Twitter to register his disapproval. ""I also condemn the actions of a small group of Chelsea fans in Paris,"" tweeted Blatter. ""There is no place for racism in football!"" This is not the first racism allegation to be leveled against the London club in recent times. In 2012, team captain John Terry was banned for four matches and fined $356,000 for racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. Terry was, however, found not guilty of any criminal wrongdoing at Westminster Magistrates' Court in July of the same year.","Group of Chelsea 'fans' filmed abusing a black man on the Paris metro .

"(CNN)Golf's landscape has changed in myriad ways since Tiger Woods launched his design business in 2006. Back then he was the game's bulldozer, barging inferior players out of the way in an all-out assault to overhaul Jack Nicklaus' tally of 18 majors and cement his title as the best of all time. Tiger Woods Design was supposed to form another facet of his burgeoning legacy; a series of lasting monuments to augment his immense standing within golf. Except the best laid plans of men often go awry. Woods hasn't won a major since the scandal that engulfed his private life in 2008 and only now, nearly a decade on from the inception of his design arm, is one of his plots open for business. With the verdict still out on whether he can recapture that magical form, and fatherhood having altered his outlook on life, the concept of legacy is very much back on the agenda. ""My goal is to design a limited number of distinct and memorable golf courses,"" Woods told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""I hope that one day the courses I design will become a lasting contribution to the game that has given me so much."" Architects forever talk about ""moving earth"" when it comes to course layout, and the sands have undoubtedly shifted under Woods' feet. After locking down 14 majors in a nine-year spell, the former world No. 1 (and current No. 47) has just five top 10 finishes in them across the last five injury-hit seasons. The benefits of those spells in rehab has been more time to dedicate to design, culminating in Woods' first opening at Cabo San Lucas in Mexico just before Christmas. And though there might have been an eight-year wait for his first completed course, which has been well received, the second should be along within eight months. It will represent an important landmark too -- his first opening in the United States, at Bluejack National in Houston. The fact that Woods' design operation is finally laying down roots across the Americas has taken on an extra significance, with his kids now of an age when they can start to play alongside their all-star dad. ""He's obviously won a whole bunch of tournaments and major championships, and they remain very important to him,"" says Michael Abbott, partner of Beacon Land Development -- the company that's building Bluejack National's course -- and a friend of Woods for over 20 years. ""But to be able to take his kids Charlie and Sam to a golf course he's done is also very important to him."" Abbott agrees that a large slice of Tiger Woods Design is about legacy. ""I think so. I think he's very proud and he wants to share that with not only those close to him but also everybody else. ""To say this is what I've learned and this is my creativity and now I'm putting it on the ground for you to see."" Perhaps unsurprisingly, the junior Woods are showing early signs of promise, much to the delight of their proud father. ""I saw as much of his son Charlie's swing as I did of his over the time we spent together (at the opening of the El Cardonal course in Mexico),"" Abbott explained. ""He'd say 'Come look at this -- this is the way I want to swing right here.' ""Tiger talks about the old days when he and his father used to go and play the short course in California and how the short course at Bluejack reminds him of that -- the ability for young girls and boys to come out and play and challenge themselves but also have pure fun. ""He also built junior tees into the course at Bluejack -- that tells you everything."" Woods, who began his 2015 season in Phoenix on Thursday, is still active in his pursuit of Nicklaus' bumper haul of major titles. But he won't be trying to match the prolific nature of ""The Golden Bear"" when it comes to rolling courses off the production line at an exponential rate. The majority of Nicklaus Design's 380 properties are in the U.S. while others are dotted around the globe in far flung places such as China, Russia, Nicaragua, Japan, Costa Rica and New Zealand. Woods' dedication to recapturing the heights he reached in the early part of the decade prevent him from taking on too much but even after he retires, he insists he'll only pick projects that mean something to him. ""Golf course design has always been something that I have been interested in,"" Woods, who attempted his first design for a magazine competition aged nine, explained. ""It wasn't until my 10th year on tour, after having success on different types of courses all over the world, that I had the knowledge and experience to start Tiger Woods Design. ""I see it continuing to be very selective, looking for only the best sites and partners to work with, even after my golf career slows down."" That the fruits of Woods' design labor are only starting to emerge has much to do with the financial downturn of 2008. Several projects have been on the table for some time; The Cliffs in North Carolina and Punta Brava in Mexico are yet to yield a completion date. A much-trumpeted project in Dubai was shelved in 2011 due to funding problems, though Woods recently announced he was teaming up with Donald Trump for another go at building in the Emirate. And while he has been enlisted to build another course at Cabo San Lucas, one industry expert thinks Woods needs to go further if his design arm is to enhance his standing in the game. ""I can't see Tiger's design business affecting his legacy unless he gets a project that really moves the dial,"" Adam Lawrence, editor of Golf Course Architecture magazine, told CNN. ""Either a site where he and his team can build something that is universally viewed as one of the best courses in the world -- which presupposes they have the ability to do so, something that hasn't be proven yet -- or alternatively they do something that has a real impact on golf's development. ""With the best will in the world, you don't change golf by building extremely expensive resort courses in Cabo, an ultra-high end residential project in Houston or a monster expensive course to be run by Donald Trump in Dubai."" Lawrence also believes Woods might also benefit -- not just himself, but also the game of golf itself -- by looking at designing a course in the BRIC countries. ""I would like to see Tiger take on a low budget project in an emerging market,"" he added. ""A Tiger-branded course in India, or Brazil -- but a proper, public access, cheap golf course and not a fancy housing development -- could really impact on how golf grows in that market."" Those projects in developing nations may well come down the line but listening to Woods, it is clear he believes Bluejack National could enter the pantheon of great U.S. courses when it opens for business. ""Bluejack National has one of the best natural settings for golf I have seen,"" he said. ""With its changes in elevation, the beautiful pines and hardwoods, Bluejack National is reminiscent of the pinelands of Georgia and the Carolinas. ""The opportunity is here to create a golf course unlike any other in the Houston area, and our goal is for it to be among the best in the nation."" Due for completion in October, Woods has been making regular visits to the site near the small town of Montgomery in Texas. Abbott says he has been struck by Woods' willingness to take other opinions on board and how in tune he is with those players at the other end of the skill spectrum to himself. ""Bluejack National is spectacular and I think it's incredibly special that this is his first course in the United States,"" Abbott said. ""When I first talked to Tiger he mentioned the playability; this one cut of turf, how you create great vistas and how all levels of players can find some success. ""When Tiger Woods goes in, he goes all the way. He doesn't do anything half way, he's an all-in guy and that's reflected in his work ethic on and off the course. ""This is important to him -- he feels like he's designing golf courses that will be meaningful because it will encourage people to play the game. ""At Bluejack he's taken it to an even further level where he's designed this playground section, a nine-hole short course that is spectacular. He's also designed four little loops that help if you only had an hour or two to play. ""Not only is he tackling golf course design from the angle of making it playable he's also tackling it from people's time commitments to be able to play, whether it is someone who wants a couple hours on the course, a corporate person entertaining a guest or a father and daughter. ""He's taken time investment and really put it into his design so you ask 'Is the guy in tune?' When a designer thinks that way I think he's in tune."" Still, any jobbing golfer standing on the first tee of a Woods-designed course could be forgiven for sweating with a mixture of fear and reverence. Woods' litany of career titles have been secured on a collection of the world's most fiendish courses, giving him ample ammunition when it came to sketching out his own ideas. But his emphasis on ""playability"" essentially says to the amateur -- 'I've got your back.' ""I have played enough pro-ams over the years to know not every golfer is a scratch handicap,"" Woods said. ""Designing golf courses that players of all skill levels find enjoyable is very important to me. The biggest compliment that a designer can receive is if a golfer can't wait to play his golf course again."" Abbott is happy to talk legacy, but he's also keen to stress that Woods still has plenty left in his playing locker. Having watched him take on a collection of journalists during the opening of El Cardonal, Abbott says Woods' swing has its ""speed and power back."" ""I'm absolutely backing Tiger to bag some more majors,"" he said, ominously. ""It's exciting to see him play this way. ""He's determined. The appetite is still there -- it's like he's never eaten before.""","Tiger Woods' design business is to form a significant part of the golfer's legacy .

"(CNN) -- Actress Raven-Symone knows exactly who she is, and that person can't be defined with the usual labels. That's what the former ""Cosby Show"" star told Oprah Winfrey on OWN on Sunday night, as she explained why she doesn't like to be labeled as gay or African-American. The actress confirmed that she's in ""an amazing, happy relationship"" with her partner, who is a woman, but added that she doesn't ""need a categorizing statement for it."" ""I don't want to be labeled gay,"" Raven-Symone said. ""I want to be labeled a human who loves humans."" Raven-Symone says she's a lesbian, grateful for legalized gay marriage . The former Disney star's sexuality has been in headlines since she tweeted in August 2013 that she was happy for the legalization of gay marriage, as it meant that she could ""finally get married!"" But that wasn't exactly a statement on her love life, Raven-Symone told Winfrey. ""That was my way of saying I'm proud of the country. ... My mother and people in my family have taught me to keep my personal life to myself as much as possible. I try my best to hold the fence where I can. But I am proud to be who I am and what I am."" Raven-Symone recalled realizing her sexuality ""when I was like 12; I was looking at everything,"" she said with a laugh. But she added that she ""doesn't need language"" to explain whom she likes -- or, for that matter, her race. Raven-Symone: My sexuality is my business . ""I'm tired of being labeled,"" Raven-Symone told Winfrey. ""I'm an American; I'm not an African-American. I'm an American."" Her statement caught even Winfrey off-guard, as the media mogul took a moment to process the actress' comment while jokingly warning her, ""don't set Twitter on fire!"" Raven-Symone defended her stance, explaining that she doesn't ""know where my roots go to; I don't know how far back they go. I don't know what country in Africa I'm from. But I do know that my roots are in Louisiana. I'm an American, and that's a colorless person, because we're all people. I have lots of things running through my veins."" Winfrey, telling Raven-Symone that she was in for ""a lot of flak for saying you're not African-American,"" gave her another opportunity to be precise about her perspective. ""I don't label myself. What I really mean by that is I'm an American,"" the actres continued. ""I have darker skin. I have a nice, interesting grade of hair. I connect with Caucasian. I connect with Asian. I connect with black. ... I connect with each culture. ... Aren't we all (a melting pot)?

"As Hurricane Sandy swept through New York City and emergency crews scrambled to rescue victims, Emily Rahimi was responding to cries for help and offering words of comfort -- all in 140 characters or less. Rahimi runs the New York Fire Department's Twitter account, which proved to be a lifeline of sorts for many stranded New Yorkers. She responded to hundreds of tweets pleading for help, most of them in the first hour or two after Sandy made landfall. ""You could see the panic and fear in the words they were typing,"" said Rahimi, who stayed at her desk through the night. ""People were so scared they were reaching out to anyone they thought might listen. It really struck a chord with me. I tried to help them as best as I could."" While hundreds of thousands of callers jammed emergency lines, Rahimi says, ""A lot of people couldn't get through to a 911 dispatcher. So I took their information and called our dispatchers myself to make sure they sent an emergency crew."" As the social media manager for the fire department, Rahimi says she always tweets out alerts to her 53,000 followers during emergencies. But this one was unique. Rahimi says she was prepared for the worst Monday night, but didn't anticipate the hundreds of messages she received from terrified people unable to reach 911. At times, she said, the sheer volume of tweets was overwhelming, but under the circumstances she considered it part of the job. Rahimi used Twitter to post updates on rising water levels from the storm surge, the broken crane dangling high above 57th Street and a fire that raged through the Breezy Point section of Queens, destroying dozens of homes. What happened during those first few hours is still mostly a blur, she said, but she will never forget some of the frantic pleas. ""One couple and their baby had moved to the second floor of their home because of floodwaters,"" she said. ""They were terrified the water would reach them."" As the night passed, the FDNY Twitter feed filled up with conversations between Rahimi and the city's distressed victims. ""My sis family at 78th St155-22 Howard Beach Queens NY 11414, water rising 12 ft need help. 1st floor drowned, kids scared,"" @rsindh tweeted. ""Dispatch was notified,"" Rahimi responded within minutes. ""I know it's difficult, but please be patient."" Rahimi, a 35-year-old transplanted Ohioan who joined the FDNY seven years ago to write for its website, stayed at her post from Monday morning until 6 p.m. Tuesday. She says one of her goals that night was to help keep people calm. ""I reassured everyone asking for our help that rescuers would eventually reach them,"" she said. Her efforts have earned her a flurry of praise and media attention, with one headline calling her a ""one-woman response team."" But Rahimi said the rescuers risking their lives were the real heroes of the storm. ""I think the firefighters who were in 6 feet of water in Breezy Point trying to put out those fires are the heroes. And the EMS members, who are going house to house in boats trying to save people in severe conditions, not knowing what they're walking into -- they're the heroes. ""I was just sitting at my desk trying my best to keep up. And I did a very small part of what went on that night,"" added Rahimi, who credits adrenaline and the energy of her co-workers with keeping her going through the night. ""I was getting loopy toward the end of it and probably wasn't making any sense whatsoever."" Days later, Rahimi is still dealing with storm victims, some of whom apparently don't realize she's an army of one. ""Amazing to see the @FDNY using @Twitter to respond to emergencies,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""I'd love to see the behind the scenes of how that's working."" For Rahimi, the most gratifying feedback has been follow-up responses from people who had sent her panicked tweets in Sandy's terrifying early hours. They ""let me know that they were rescued,"" she said. ""It was nice because you kind of sit there and wonder, 'Did these people get help?' ''","Fire Department handled hundreds of tweets from frightened residents as Sandy struck .

"Planning to travel in or to the United States and wondering if the U.S. government shutdown will hit your plans? Well, you may need to tweak some sight-seeing portions of your itinerary. Never mind that visit to the Statue of Liberty in New York City. Forget visiting Independence Hall in Philadelphia. And that hiking adventure at Yellowstone National Park? It won't happen. Congress, wrangling over spending and Obamacare, failed to renew government funds in time for the start of the new fiscal year on Tuesday, and many travelers -- both domestic and international visitors -- will quickly start feeling the impact of the shutdown. While rail networks, essential air security and traffic control operations won't be impeded, travelers visiting the country's national parks and other government-run tourist attractions will find the gates shuttered and the doors locked. All 401 National Park Service sites, which collectively average about 715,000 visitors per day in October, will be closed, according to a park service spokeswoman. (Guests staying in campgrounds and on-site hotels will be given 48 hours to leave.) The Smithsonian's 19 museums and galleries and the National Zoo will also turn visitors away. In addition to the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, the shutdown bars tourists from two of the world's top destinations for aviation enthusiasts: the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Florida, and the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Ohio's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Is it safe to fly? Airport security personnel are considered essential, so travelers please continue to follow Transportation Security Administration rules about liquids, shoes and other restrictions at the airport. Air traffic controllers, some safety inspectors and other essential employees will ""continue working in order to maintain the safety of the national airspace system,"" said the Federal Aviation Administration, in an e-mailed statement.  ""Safety is our top priority."" Most immigration, border and customs employees are also considered essential personnel, which means passport controls at U.S. borders and points of entry like airports and cruise ports -- should be unaffected by the shutdown. Other FAA projects, including facility security inspections, routine personnel security background investigations and development of the next generation of air traffic control technology, will be placed on hold. What if you're waiting on a passport? If you're waiting on a U.S. passport, how long that wait will last depends on where the passport agency is located.

"(CNN) -- Forget about Pharrell Williams' hat. We're more interested in his skincare routine. Somehow, the 40-year-old musical everyman has been in the business for roughly 20 years without appearing to have aged a single day. As anyone with a job in the entertainment industry can tell you, that's not easy. Even the typical Hollywood attempts to appear younger end up going the opposite way. But ""Skateboard P"" noticeably doesn't have such problems. The producer and performer's visage looks so youthful, some have even started to question whether there's a supernatural power involved. The speculation has become so prominent that the Grammy winner recently decided to put the gossip to rest. ""No I am not (a vampire),"" Pharrell told Time Out London this week. ""I'm willing to go on record as saying that I don't drink people's blood."" Then, Pharrell graciously shared his personal fountain of youth to the masses: ""How do I stay so young-looking for a 40-year-old?"" I wash my face."" It's possible that answer won't satisfy conspiracy theorists, so we're going to toss out one of our own: .

"How was Danvers High math teacher Colleen Ritzer killed? With a box cutter the suspect, 14-year-old Philip Chism, had brought into school, a source close to the investigation says. What happened to her body afterward? It was stashed in a recycling bin, rolled outside, then dumped about 20 feet into woods behind the northeastern Massachusetts high school's athletic fields, adds another source. It was left there -- not buried, not even covered. And where did the alleged killer go afterward? After changing his clothes, he went to a Wendy's fast food restaurant and a movie, sources say, before police in a neighboring town saw him walking on a busy road under the pitch-dark sky early Wednesday. Those are the answers, many of them revealed Thursday, two days after the teacher's killing. Yet the question of why this happened -- why a popular young educator who always wore a smile and went the extra mile was killed allegedly by a teenager who friends, family and co-workers described as reserved and well-behaved -- continues to loom large. Chism, who had moved to the Boston suburb of Danvers before the start of the school year, remained jailed without bond Thursday. A grand jury will play a big part in deciding his next step: If they indict him for first- or second-degree murder, he -- like any juvenile age 14 or older -- would be tried as an adult, based on Massachusetts law. Meanwhile, the tight-knit North Shore community is still trying to make sense of what he allegedly did and of life without a teacher who so many appreciated, learned from and loved. ""It's just surreal how quickly someone can go, and how much we take for granted every day,"" said Danvers High student Chris Weimert. ""(Ritzer was) the nicest teacher you could ever have. I can't believe it."" Two missing persons' reports come together . Students and colleagues described the 24-year-old Ritzer as someone who gave everything for her students -- be it a pat on the back, a sensible explanation to a tricky concept, or the time, effort and heart to work through problems, math or otherwise, with them. One of those students was Chism, a freshman. He'd been doodling and listening to music during his Algebra I class in the school's final period, classmate Cambria Cloutier told CNN. Creating such drawings was unusual for Chism, who Cloutier recalled rarely participated in class discussions but was ""a really good student."" When the final bell sounded at 1:55 p.m. Tuesday, Ritzer asked him to stay after class, according to Cloutier, who sat two desks over from Chism. While shuttling between two afterschool meetings, Cloutier said she looked into the same classroom and saw Ritzer standing by her computer and Chism sitting in a chair about five to 10 feet away. The teacher smiled at her, Cloutier recalled. At some point that afternoon, Ritzer went to a regular students' girls bathroom on Danver High's second floor, as someone was in the locked faculty bathroom, a source close to the investigation said. Chism allegedly followed her in. There, Ritzer was punched a few times before being killed with a box cutter around 3:30 p.m., said a source. Her body went into a recycling bin, then outside the school where it was tossed. Authorities eventually found a bin that apparently had been thrown off an embankment some 100 feet away from Ritzer's body, a source said. Before police found her -- before they even knew she was missing -- they'd started looking for Chism. This was in the early evening, with Danvers Police tweeting to residents that he hadn't returned home and was last seen around the Hollywood Hits movie theater in the town some 20 miles northeast of Boston. While they were looking for him, police got a call around 11:20 p.m. Tuesday about another missing person: Ritzer. She wasn't home either, nor had she answered her phones. The stories started coming together about an hour later, when police officers in nearby Topsfield found Chism walking along Route 1. Whatever he told detectives in his subsequent interviews, whatever they saw in surveillance footage from the school, led to Chism's arrest for murder. It also led them to Ritzer's body in the woods. Read the complaint . A quiet and normal student . Chism is a quiet young man, those who know him said. He excelled at soccer and made a harmless impression. ""He ... seemed quiet and reserved, but he just seemed normal,"" said Ariana Edwards, who was in Chism's English class. Chism didn't drink or do drugs, and he came from a good family, one of his closest friends said. He described Chism as a good athlete who was shy at first but eventually warmed up to people, adding that he hadn't been acting strangely lately. Friends got their first hint that something was awry when Chism didn't show up for soccer practice Tuesday. The team set out to look for him after seeing texts that he was missing. He was a newcomer to Danvers, a town of about 26,000 people. His family had bounced around, and he had lived in different cities in Tennessee and Florida since he was in fourth grade, authorities in those states said. A teacher who went the extra mile . Meanwhile, many were at a loss in Danvers to explain the death of Ritzer -- a woman who inspired many, whether it be in the classroom or online, with her heart, intellect and positive spirit. ""She was talking on Saturday about this year was a good year. She was teaching freshmen for the first time. She was happy,"" said Jen Berger, Ritzer's best friend. ""I don't even know what the world is like without her. It's a scary thought."" Sympathy spread through the region, making its way into the baseball World Series. Bleachers full of fans who had assembled to watch the Boston Red Sox take on the St. Louis Cardinals observed a moment of silence in Ritzer's honor before Game 1 began Wednesday night at Boston's Fenway Park. Ritzer, a 2011 graduate of Assumption College who was working towards a master's degree at Salem State University, seemed to always wear a wide smile and was approachable to students and colleagues alike, said Charlotte Dzerkacz, who became good friends with Ritzer in 2011 when they taught at the same middle school. ""She was energetic, she was compassionate,"" Dzerkacz said. ""You couldn't ask for anything more from a teacher or a friend."" Salem State issued a statement lamenting Ritzer's death. ""She believed children have much to offer and often do not realize how special they are as individuals,"" the university said. ""In her application to Salem State she said she was dedicated to 'helping students in times of need.'"" Ritzer was known to take to Twitter to dole out homework assignments and wisdom to her students. ""No matter what happens in life, be good to people,"" she wrote in August. ""Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind.""

"According to ancient legend, Iceland was once an immortal battlefield, with gods waging war in lava fields. Plumes of lava represented souls flung out from the inferno, while volcanoes were portals to hell. As one of the most volcanic regions in the world today, Iceland is home to more than 130 volcanic mountains -- many of them ""active,"" meaning that they've erupted during the past few centuries. It's also the only place on Earth you can take an elevator inside a volcano's magma chamber. In May, for the third year in a row, Thrihnukagigur (""Three Peaks Crater"") is open to visitors brave enough to venture inside. Hotspot . Located south of the capital Reykjavik,Thrihnukagigur sits at the center of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a submarine mountain range running along the Atlantic Ocean. While volcanic chambers are usually sealed shut, Thrihnukagigur's isn't, and scientists aren't sure why. The magma seems to have drained away, leaving a chasm under Iceland's surface. Cave explorer Dr. Árni B Stefánsson discovered Thrihnukagigur's magma chamber in 1974. He fought to open the chamber to visitors and has championed sustainable approaches to the project in numerous academic papers. The first tourists took the plunge in 2012. The tour begins . Our tour to the heart of the volcano starts at the foot of the Bláfjöll mountain range, where roads end. Guides lead us across the lava fields to a welcome cabin, which is constructed each May with parts brought in by helicopter. Hauling metal sheeting and equipment to this remote area takes more than a week with three helicopters. In September, the end of tour season, the cabin is dismantled again and nothing is left behind. It's less than an hour's hike to the cabin, but the terrain of gnarled basalt wreaks havoc on all but the toughest of hiking boots. Inside, we're sized for harnesses and helmets. The promise of traditional meat soup distracts those visitors with vertigo. Habitat for 'hidden people' A short walk leads from the cabin up to the northeastern peak. From the top of the cinder cone, which rises 35 meters higher than its surroundings, the land looks vast and empty. There's no trace of civilization, just rocks sprinkled with moss and splatters of lichen and ashy peaks extending to the horizon. Traditionally, these rocks and small underground caves are associated with huldufólk, Iceland's ""hidden people."" Our journey into hell is by open cable elevator. The metal cage, installed in 2010 for use by researchers, takes small groups of tourists down the neck of the crater into a chamber taller than the Statue of Liberty. There are plans to build a tunnel connecting the chamber to the surface, but the project's impact is still being evaluated -- allowing access isn't without risk. Human influence threatens the cave's unique beauty, and visitors must tread lightly, taking away anything they bring and not removing fragments of rock. An additional disincentive against theft is the huldufólk -- legend has it they react violently to any pillaging of Iceland's natural wealth. Making the descent . After the lift operator attaches each visitor's harness to the elevator frame with carabiners, he jolts the elevator into action and it rumbles slowly into a deep crevice in the ground. The metal cage scrapes loudly against the rock face as droplets of water roll from the rocks and thunk onto our helmets. After plummeting 120 meters, the elevator drops onto the magma chamber's floor. There's no sound except dripping water and the sky is only visible as a distant chink of light. Separation from the world above is total. Exploring the chamber . Untethered from the elevator cage, we're free to clamber around the cave floor. The walls glow bronze and indigo, like the sheen on spilled oil. The parts of the cave baked by sulfur-rich gases are marked by yellow, while patches of cobalt blue show where chunks of rock have crashed from the walls. We see icicles of rock, where magma hardened as it dripped to the cave floor. Although relatively little is known about the ecosystem here, the vivid colors on the rocks are attributed to clusters of microorganisms. A few visitors point nervously at puffs of steam rising from the cavern's far corners. ""The elves are smoking,"" jokes our guide, Einar Daníelsson. In reality, the puffs come from moisture evaporating as droplets hit the surface of electric lamps, the only light sources in the cave, but it's easy to see how the myths about elves began. ""You can imagine, when you are walking alone in the fog and there's all these strange formations,"" says Daníelsson. When we're brought back up to the daylight, I find that my eyes are easily deceived. Distant lumps of granite seem to moving, while patterns on the ground take on the appearance of portals to another world.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The crown of the Statue of Liberty will reopen to tourists on July 4. The Statue of Liberty welcomes visitors, immigrants, and returning Americans. The crown was closed after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, for safety and security reasons. The National Park Service closed the attraction amid worries that it would be difficult for visitors to evacuate quickly in the event of an emergency. Visitors must climb a narrow 168-step double-helix spiral staircase to get to the crown. Since the closing, tourists have been able to visit other parts of the statue. iReport.com: Show us your best Statue of Liberty shots . The federal government planned to give ""America a special gift"" by re-opening the crown, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in May. ""We are once again inviting the public to celebrate our great nation and the hope and opportunity it symbolizes by climbing to Lady Liberty's crown for a unique view of New York Harbor, where the forebears of millions of American families first saw the world,"" he said in a statement. Access to the crown will be limited to 10 people at a time, guided by a National Park Service ranger. ""We cannot eliminate all the risk of climbing to the crown, but we are taking steps to make it safer,"" Salazar said. The measures include raising the handrails on the spiral staircase and stationing rangers throughout the Statue to help visitors. The Statue of Liberty will be open for the next two years, then closed again for ""work on a long-term solution that will improve safety and security permanently,"" according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Hundreds of Islamist militants were among the prisoners freed from a notorious Tripoli prison this week, according to a former Libyan jihadist. The freed militants had been imprisoned in Tripoli's Abu Salim prison by Moammar Gadhafi's regime during the height of the insurgency in Iraq, according to Noman Benotman, once a senior figure in the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. Benotman said he believes as many as 600 militants may have been among the prison population at Abu Salim. It's not known how many prisoners were held in the vast facility. Human Rights Watch said Gadhafi's prisons ""have been filled to the limit in the last few months with thousands of people who were arrested for taking part in the anti-Gadhafi protests, or because of their suspected support for Libya's democratic opposition."" The human rights group, which recently had a team visit the prison, estimates that before the uprising, there were a few hundred Islamists held at Abu Salim. Benotman said many of the militants released are pro-al Qaeda. ""Nobody knows what these released prisoners are going to do next,"" he said. ""Will they take part in the fighting and if they do will they join pre-existing rebel brigades or form a separate fighting force?"" Benotman, now a senior analyst at the Quilliam Foundation in London, said the freed prisoners are Salafists, embracing a puritanical interpretation of Islam that has gained ground in Libya in recent years. Gadhafi's regime imprisoned thousands of suspected pro-al Qaeda militants after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq stoked radicalization in Libya, especially in its impoverished eastern provinces. According to Benotman, those rounded up by the regime included militants who had tried to travel to Iraq and some who had returned from fighting against U.S. forces there. He said many of them had already been released by the Gadhafi regime. Internal al Qaeda in Iraq records seized by the U.S. military in 2007 indicated that proportionately more Libyans traveled to fight with al Qaeda in Iraq than from any other Arab country. Some saw fighting in Iraq as a ""a last act of defiance against the Gadhafi regime,"" according to a confidential 2008 State Department cable made public by the website WikiLeaks, because of the rapprochement at the time between Gadhafi and the United States. Wednesday's prison release, which occurred as rebel forces took control of the Abu Salim area of Tripoli, comes as Islamists are taking on an increasingly prominent role in the fight against the Gadhafi regime -- to the concern of some in the West. Former members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) have assumed leadership positions in several rebel brigades, according to Benotman. Their current prominence, he said, was due to their quick mobilization -- as armed opposition replaced peaceful protests in Libya -- and their valued military skills. The former leader of the LIFG, Abdullah al Sadeeq, now commands one of the most powerful rebel brigades in Tripoli, according to Benotman and, according to reports, took charge of successful rebel efforts earlier this week to storm Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound, further bolstering his prominent position in rebel ranks. Sadeeq was a well-known figure in the jihadist movement. He fought the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan and helped found the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group there. In the mid-1990s the LIFG conducted a deadly campaign of attacks on Libyan security services, before a crackdown largely constrained the group's ability to operate inside the country.  After the fall of the Taliban, Sadeeq fled Afghanistan to Iran and was eventually arrested in Hong Kong in 2004. According to Benotman, he was then held and interrogated by the CIA before being transferred to Libya where he was held in Abu Salim prison until his release in March 2010. But Sadeeq has now become a powerful voice against al Qaeda's terrorism, according to Benotman, who says that Sadeeq always resisted requests by Osama bin Laden for his Libyan group to join forces with al Qaeda. In 2009, Sadeeq and other senior LIFG leaders formally repudiated al Qaeda style terrorism and disbanded their campaign to overthrow the Libyan regime. The breakthrough was the result of a two-year dialogue with the regime brokered by Benotman. CNN interviewed leading figures of the LIFG in Abu Salim prison in Tripoli in September 2009, shortly before the group's leaders were released. Although they were then behind prison bars, the leaders' disavowal of violence appeared genuine. Benotman says that former LIFG members who have again taken up arms have fused their efforts with rebel forces and do not operate as a separate armed group. Instead they have created a new political organization called the Islamic Movement for Change, which Benotman says is committed to working within a future democratic process. He says other Islamist units are operating in Libya but does not know of any former members of his group who are fighting with them. Benotman says that it will be important for the National Transitional Council to keep a close watch over the militants released from Abu Salim jail -- especially if they begin operating as a group outside the NTC chain of command.  According to Benotman, the presence of former LIFG leaders in rebel ranks like Abdullah Sadeeq may help prevent this happening. LIFG members and the younger generation of Salafi jihadists were often incarcerated in the same wing of Abu Salim prison. Benotman believes the presence of former LIFG commanders in rebel front lines will enhance their credibility amongst the released prisoners. But he says some among the younger generation of jihadists have already begun operating outside the orbit of the NTC.  In the east, where radicalization has historically run highest, young Salafi jihadists have linked up with foreign militants and may even have started their own training camps to train volunteers to fight the Gadhafi regime, according to Benotman. A number of jihadists, he says, have entered Libya from other Arab countries.  In June, the NTC detained two suspected Jordanian jihadists in al-Brega in eastern Libya and expelled them, according to Benotman. Neighboring Algeria, which waged a long battle against Islamist insurgents in the 1990s, has already expressed concern about the instability in Libya being exploited by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and other jihadist groups. Algerian officials are also concerned that weapons such as ground-to-air missiles may have fallen into militant hands, a worry that has also been expressed by U.S. commanders.","""This is potentially a very dangerous development,"" a former Libyan jihadist tells CNN .

"Skin cancer is on the rise, according to the American Cancer Society, with more cases diagnosed annually than breast, prostate, lung and colon cancer cases combined. On Tuesday, the United States surgeon general issued a call to action to prevent the disease, calling it a major public health problem that requires immediate action.  Nearly 5 million people are treated for skin cancer each year. ""Until today, the surgeon general has never said, 'UV radiation is bad for you; protect your skin,' "" acting Surgeon General Dr. Boris Lushniak said. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has set five goals for communities to decrease the risk of skin cancer, such as providing shade at parks, schools and other public spaces, and reducing indoor tanning. A dermatologist himself, Lushniak said it's important for parents to teach their children about sun safety, just as they would dental care and eating healthily. ""We have to change the social norms about tanning,"" he said. ""Tanned skin is damaged skin, and we need to shatter the myth that tanned skin is a sign of health."" Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer because of how fast it spreads to other parts of the body, accounts for only 2% of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. Each year, more than 63,000 cases of melanoma are diagnosed in the United States, and 9,000 people die from it.  From 1973 to 2011, melanoma rates increased more than 200%, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The National Cancer Institute reported that melanoma is the most common form of cancer in adults ages 25 to 29 and second most common for young adults aged 15 to 29. To reduce the risk of skin cancer, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing a hat, sunglasses and protective clothing and using sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. On Monday, the House of Representatives passed the Sunscreen Innovation Act. The bill includes a review process for all manufacturers submitting a new sunscreen to the Food and Drug Administration, with a deadline for the FDA to provide final decisions: one year for pending applications and 1½ years for new ones. The last over-the-counter sunscreen ingredient approved by the FDA was in 1999, according to the Public Access to SunScreens Coalition. Eight new sunscreen applications have since been filed with the FDA.  All are still waiting for review, the coalition says; some have been waiting for over a decade. Ecamsule was approved as a new sunscreen active ingredient in 2008, according to the FDA, allowing it to be marketed as the specific product provided in the application, Helioblock SX. However, Ecamsule is still under review to be added as an approved sunscreen ingredient that all manufacturers are free to use. The current policy requires the FDA to undergo an extensive rule-making process before reviewing any new product application and adding it to the approved list, according to coalition policy director Michael Werner.  This can take years, making the process inefficient. ""This law takes out the rule-making aspect and allows the FDA to simply issue a decision,"" Werner said. Many of the new sunscreens awaiting approval in the United States have been available in Europe, Central Asia and South America for years. Generally speaking, the ingredients waiting for approval are simply newer types of UVA filters than are currently being used, Werner said, but they differ slightly by manufacturer. ""The FDA will issue responses to the safety and efficacy data submitted for each ingredient in the near future,"" FDA spokeswoman Andrea Fischer wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""We are committed to completing the TEA (Time and Extent Application) process for the sunscreen active ingredients currently under review as quickly as possible, consistent with available agency resources and competing public health priorities."" Indoor tanning is also a major contributor to skin cancer.  It's estimated that more than 400,000 cases of skin cancer each year are related to indoor tanning, 6,000 of which are melanomas, according to Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Howard Koh. Sunlamps and tanning beds get FDA warning . There are laws requiring minors to have parental consent in 44 states, but only 10 prohibit minors from indoor tanning altogether. According to the CDC, about 30% of white women ages 18 to 25 report indoor tanning. ""The concern with indoor tanning is the concentrated burst of high-intensity UV rays on uncovered skin,"" Lushniak said.  ""Although it's only a short burst, it's a higher intensity than what one would experience outdoors."" Two-thirds of adults reported having a sunburn in 2010, according to the CDC.  Because a single sunburn increases a person's risk for skin cancer, Lushniak said that it's important for people to realize that sun safety applies to everyone, even if you're not fair-skinned. ""We know that the risk level for skin cancer decreases with more skin pigmentation,"" he said.  ""But no one is immune.  All races are still diagnosed and still affected by UV rays.""

"Whether you're a three-pack-a-day smoker who doesn't like being lectured to about the health risks, or you're a person who doesn't touch cigarettes and wouldn't smoke one if you were offered a Ferrari in exchange, picture this: . Imagine, for a moment, that cigarettes had never been invented. And that in 2013 an eager entrepreneur went to the Food and Drug Administration seeking approval for a new product -- cigarettes -- that he wanted to sell to the American people. Imagine that the Food and Drug Administration, taking its time and doing its homework, came up with all the currently available medical evidence about the dangers of smoking. Whether you're a smoker or not, you know what the FDA's response would be to that hypothetical entrepreneur: . They'd laugh him out of the room. They'd ask him why he was wasting their time. They might, if they were feisty enough, point out the deadly impact of what he was asking them to authorize, and say to him: . ""There's a legal term for knowingly causing death to people. In asking us to approve your product, sir, are you not setting us up to become accessories to murder?"" But cigarettes are not a new product. They are perfectly legal in all 50 states, and they're going to stay that way. Which is why two cigarette-related events last week are so instructive. The federal government gave up its highly publicized battle to make every package of cigarettes carry large, gruesome-looking illustrations. FDA changes course on graphic warning labels for cigarettes . The proposed illustrations -- they included images of a diseased lung, of a tracheotomy hole in a man's throat, of rotting teeth -- were rolled out with great fanfare in 2010. The government wanted the illustrations to cover the entire top half -- front and back -- of every pack of cigarettes sold in the United States. Last week, faced with arguments from the tobacco industry that the mandatory images violated free speech rights -- the cigarette companies said the images were ""intended to elicit loathing, disgust and repulsion"" -- the government backed down. Attorney General Eric Holder wrote that the government will not fight the case in the Supreme Court. The FDA will instead reevaluate the proposed labels. Last week's second event took place in New York, where Mayor Michael Bloomberg asked for a law that would force merchants to hide cigarettes on sale in their stores. ""Hide"" in a literal sense. The legislation would mandate that any cigarettes sold in a store would have to be concealed in a drawer, or in a cabinet, or behind a curtain -- it would be unlawful for the packs of cigarettes to be visible to anyone visiting the store. Bloomberg's point is that the more difficult it is to purchase cigarettes, the fewer packs will be sold, and the healthier citizens will become. Bloomberg: Nanny-in-chief or health crusader? Bloomberg's proposal, and the case of the ghastly illustrations, both underline America's bizarrely bifurcated relationship with cigarettes: . The country -- smokers and nonsmokers alike --  realizes the dangers involved. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that around 443,000 people a year die because of cigarette use. But the product is as legal as a loaf of bread or a jar of pickles. So the cigarette manufacturers have a point when they say the government is overstepping by demanding nauseating images on their packages.  Free speech does not only refer to our right to say anything we choose; it also refers to our protection from having the government force us to say things against our will. Even convicted killers, when speaking in court before sentencing, are not required to say they are guilty. The government has a right to create, publish and broadcast the strongest anti-smoking campaigns it can come up with, but the cigarette companies make a compelling case in saying that, as long as their product is legal, they should not be forced to print repellent images on their packages. (And -- who knows? -- the federal government, in deciding not to fight the package illustrations battle in the Supreme Court, may be wary of what could happen there. What if the Supreme Court not only ruled against the proposed graphic illustrations -- but additionally, on similar grounds, opened up the question of whether the text-only warning messages on cigarette packs, the ones that have been there since the 1960s, also are an incursion on free speech?) In New York, Bloomberg's heart may be in the right place, but merchants who want to sell cigarettes should be justifiably puzzled: If any product is not legal, then they should be barred from stocking it, but as long as it is, how can anyone presume to tell them where to display it -- or, more to the point, that they can't display it? It all comes down to this: . While well-intentioned attempts to curb smoking may appear bold and decisive, they are in the end timid.  The big and most effective step -- outlawing cigarettes on the grounds that they undeniably, in the long run, sicken and kill the people who smoke them, and those around them -- is not going to happen. Politicians would be terrified to do it -- there are an estimated 45 million smokers in the United States, and no one is going to risk alienating them by completely cutting them off from cigarettes. In an already shaky economy, the repercussions from shutting down the tobacco industry -- the jobs suddenly lost -- would be, to put it mildly, highly problematic from a political and real-world standpoint. The memory of Prohibition would undoubtedly be on lawmakers' minds. The government once tried to take from people something they had been accustomed to, something that had been legal: alcohol. The outcome was anything but pretty. If there really were the political will to end cigarette use, there are ways. Each state sets its own laws for the minimum age to purchase cigarettes -- in most states, it's 18. If states decided to raise the age to, say, 80, that would do it. But the chances are zero. Like it or not, the country has painted itself into a corner. Cigarettes kill. They will continue to. If they were a new product, they'd never make it to market.  Don't bet against them still being here a century from now.","Bob Greene: Cigarettes would never be accepted if they were just now being introduced today .

"On the morning of June 11, 2012, our lives were changed forever. Our 18-year-old, 6-foot-5, handsome, athletic, college-bound, artistic son Christian had been found dead from a mixture of dangerous synthetic drugs given to him at a house party. The drugs were later identified as 2C-C-NBOMe and 25I-NBOMe, (also called 2C-I-NBOMe) very powerful and lethal synthetic drugs. While we were planning Christian's funeral, across the river in East Grand Forks, Minnesota, 17-year-old Elijah Stai was given a lethal dose of 25I-NBOMe from the same source of drugs that killed Christian. The drugs had been mixed with melted chocolate. The federal government called the investigation Operation Stolen Youth and a joint task force would trace the 25I-NBOMe all the way to its source in Houston, where it had been imported from overseas, sold online, sent to North Dakota, killing two teens and causing serious bodily harm to a handful of other teens here. Until the death of our son, we knew very little about synthetic designer drugs. We have been horrified to learn about the serious injuries, thousands of calls to poison control, increased emergency room visits, severe psychotic states and deaths that have resulted from their use and the ineffective and outdated state and federal laws that made it possible for many of these drugs to be sold in retail stores and online. America is at war with synthetic drugs. Sadly, the majority of Americans don't know about synthetic drugs or that the war is in their own homes via the Internet or at the corner tobacco store. In 2009, when our son was in the ninth grade, the DEA had just a few synthetic drugs identified. By the end of 2012, over 158 new synthetic drugs were identified and currently, more than 300 drugs are known. What you need to know about synthetic drugs . Synthetic drugs on the streets are industrial grade chemicals made-to-order in overseas laboratories. Most of these drugs have never been tested on humans -- they are poison. As in our son's case, dealers don't disclose they are selling or handing out dangerous chemicals, instead they call it ""acid"" or ""mushroom"" and teens usually don't know what it is. We miss our son beyond words, and in his memory, we have fought for change to protect other lives. We testified at the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy hearing to enact an emergency ban and at the state legislative and state Senate hearings to change state law.  After 19 reported deaths caused by 25I-NBOMe in the United States, the DEA in November of 2013 added the drug to the controlled substance list. This dangerous drug will be illegal at least until next year. To make it a permanent controlled substance, everyone needs to contact their state and federal government representatives. We have learned that bereaved parents not for one second of one day ever forget the child they lost, so it's OK to talk to us about our son.  Every area of our lives has been affected: our family, our jobs, our friends and our entire belief structure. When we meet someone for the first time, we ask whether they have children and our second question is if they know about synthetic drugs. There is too much apathy in America regarding drugs. Drugs are not someone else's problem -- it affects all of society. We need to stop blaming the victim. The night my son died, two other teens were also injured. Many teens don't understand the risks involved and often try drugs because of peer pressure. And when things go wrong, some don't call for help because they don't want to get in trouble. The only way to stop further deaths is for everyone to be knowledgeable about the dangers. Parents share memories and warnings . If you are reading, this please spread the word and help save lives! Educate yourself and your kids, and participate in changing your state laws to protect teens and young adults who are most at risk. Advocate for Good Samaritan laws that grant immunity from criminal prosecution to those seeking medical help for someone experiencing an overdose. Our first priority is to save human lives. Parents please supervise the activities in your own home and teach your kids to call for help. Other drugs and drug paraphernalia were found at the house where my son was given the drugs. Recently we attended an emotional award ceremony at the United State Attorney's Office in Fargo, North Dakota, to honor one of the special agents for his work in Operation Stolen Youth. My husband, with tears in his eyes, said it could have been called Operation Christian's Heroes. We saw the Department of Justice Seal on the wall inscribed with a Latin motto emphasizing justice. Our son was a Latin scholar, in that moment we felt like Christian was there with us. We love you more than the sky, Son! Keith and Debbie .","Christian Bjerk, 18, died after taking synthetic drugs .

"(CNN) -- Though the air traffic control system for London airspace has been restored after a technical failure, angry passengers forced to deal with long delays and other hassles reported scenes of disorganization and ""disaster"" as a result of interruptions to their travel plans. In Heathrow Airport's Terminal 5, which handles mostly British Airways flights and from which many of the airport's canceled flights were scheduled to take off, stranded passengers still stood in huge queues Friday night. Others sat in postures of dejection, some anxiously eyeing crowded power outlets as charges on their mobile phones began to fade. Few airport or airline employees seemed to be offering information as would-be fliers waited for baggage drop, check-in and -- for those who had missed their flights or whose flights were canceled -- hotel rooms provided by British Airways. Lionel Leclercq, who arrived at the airport at 4 p.m. for a 6:20 p.m. flight to Brussels, said because the airline had stopped taking baggage, he wasn't able to board his flight because he had a suitcase. ""They are so disorganized. ... I had to sit and watch my flight take off just because there was no one available to take my luggage,"" Leclercq told CNN. ""Now I have no way to get out tonight because the queues are so long."" Passengers needing to rebook flights were being asked to call a hotline, but several passengers told CNN they had to wait for extended periods on hold with little success. At Terminal 5 baggage claim -- hundreds of unclaimed bags sitting beside carousels -- a baggage handler told CNN that people have been leaving the airport without collecting their bags. ""Those people expect their bags to be delivered to their homes,"" said the baggage handler. Such had been the lengthy wait for checked luggage that many people seemed to have given up waiting. ""It's pot luck, you can wait five minutes to get your bag or five hours,"" said baggage handler. Uncharacteristically, several arriving flights were not immediately assigned carousels. Information bottleneck . A woman who asked to be called only ""angry British Airways passenger"" was kept waiting in Paris for more than an hour and half to take off for London. As a result, she missed her connection to Washington, D.C., and was livid because she paid $7,500 dollars for a business-class seat and ""now I'm being asked to queue in line with everyone else for a hotel."" ""It's a mess, it's a disaster,"" said the woman, adding that passengers were given little information. ""The worst thing is, no one's helping."" The reason for that, according to Angela Gittens, director-general of Montreal-based Airports Council International, may be because Heathrow officials might not know much more than the passengers themselves. ""This is not an air traffic problem that originated at Heathrow, but in the en route environment, which makes it much more difficult to find out what's happening,"" Gittens told CNN. ""Although it's happening to (Heathrow) and they're dealing with it, it's not their situation to fix, so the airport may not have that much information in terms of how long the situation is going to last, which is what passengers want to know. ""They just deal with accepting (the information) and aircraft that are sent their way."" Meanwhile, intercom announcements repeated at Heathrow stating that the ""system is completely restored and we are working with all airlines to minimize the delays"" were doing little to soothe frayed nerves of many passengers, with reports of flight delays of as long as six and a half hours. A Heathrow spokeswoman told CNN the airport couldn't predict how long delays would last or what the impact into Saturday might be. ""At the moment, we're trying to get as many people away (Friday night) as we can,"" the spokeswoman said. CNN's Nic Robertson also contributed to this report.","Air traffic delays create long lines of angry passengers at Heathrow Airport .

"President Barack Obama formally canceled a much-discussed visit to Moscow next month for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing a lack of progress in bilateral relations since Putin regained the presidency a year ago. Obama will still attend a G-20 summit in St. Petersburg in early September, but now will go to Sweden beforehand instead of stopping in Moscow to meet with Putin, the White House announced. ""Following a careful review begun in July, we have reached the conclusion that there is not enough recent progress in our bilateral agenda with Russia to hold a U.S.-Russia Summit in early September,"" a White House statement said. In addition, no one-on-one meeting between Obama and Putin is scheduled for the G-20 summit, a senior administration official told CNN on the condition of not being identified. However, the two leaders would see each other at group meetings in St. Petersburg. The White House statement noted progress in relations with Russia during Obama's first term, much of it when Dmitry Medvedev was president and Putin was prime minister. Putin regained the presidency in May 2012. Obama: 'No patience' for anti-LGBT laws in Russia . ""Given our lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control, trade and commercial relations, global security issues, and human rights and civil society in the last 12 months, we have informed the Russian government that we believe it would be more constructive to postpone the summit until we have more results from our shared agenda,"" the White House said. The statement also cited Russia's recent decision to grant asylum to classified leaker Edward Snowden as a factor in the decision, but a senior administration official told CNN that the talks with Putin were likely to have been canceled regardless. ""We just hadn't gotten any traction"" on issues that the summit would have addressed, including missile defense and a reduction in nuclear missiles, the official said on the condition of not being identified, adding that attempts to find common ground on economic and trade agreements also were problematic. ""We're not in the business of doing summits just to do summits,"" the official told CNN. Despite canceling the Moscow talks with Putin, the White House said a meeting set for Friday between Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel with their Russian counterparts would proceed ""to discuss how we can best make progress moving forward on the full range of issues in our bilateral relationship."" Yuri Ushakov, an aide to Putin, told reporters on Wednesday that ""we're disappointed with the U.S. administration's decision,"" the Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported. ""It's clear that the decision is linked to the situation around former CIA contractor Edward Snowden,"" Ushakov said, according to Tass, which quoted him as saying the situation ""illustrates that the U.S. is not ready to build equal relations with Russia."" The invitation for Obama ""remains in force,"" he said. What Obama said on Leno . The senior Obama administration official said, ""we still have business to do with these guys on Afghanistan and Iran as well as other issues."" On NBC's ""Tonight Show"" Tuesday, Obama said he was disappointed Russia had granted asylum to Snowden, a former government contractor who leaked details of National Security Agency surveillance programs that sparked a political firestorm. The United States wants Russia to return Snowden to face trial on charges under the Espionage Act, but Russia instead granted him at least a year of asylum and he is in an unknown location in the country. Russia's leaders have a proclivity for slipping into a Cold War mindset, Obama said, adding that it is essential that cooperation continues between the two nations. Obama also criticized Russia for a new law banning ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors."" Opinion: Make Olympics in Russia the gayest ever . Implemented last month after Putin signed it into law, the measure bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear it. The law has been condemned by Russian and international rights groups as highly discriminatory. ""I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them,"" Obama said. U.S. legislators from both parties had called for Obama to cancel the Moscow talks with Putin, and some suggested he also should refuse to attend the G-20 summit in Russia. ""Putin doesn't deserve the respect after what he's done with Snowden,"" Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York told CNN on Wednesday. ""He goes out of his way to stick the knife into the United States."" But Schumer said he supports Obama attending the G-20 gathering.

"After a 10-year chase taking it billions of miles across the solar system, the Rosetta spacecraft is homing in on its close encounter with a comet. Pictures of the oddly-shaped rock have already been returned but on Wednesday scientists at the European Space Agency, which is leading the project, say they hope to see images from within about 75 miles as the probe carries out the last of its braking maneuvers. If successful, the mission will notch up a series of firsts. Rosetta will be the first spacecraft to orbit a comet on its journey around the sun, and in November mission controllers aim to place the robotic lander Philae on the surface -- something that has never been done before. Previous missions have performed comet fly-bys but Rosetta is different. This probe will follow the comet for more than a year, mapping and measuring how it changes as it is blasted by the sun's energy. Mission controllers had to use the gravity of Earth and Mars to give the probe a slingshot acceleration to meet its target on the right trajectory. Rosetta also had to be put into hibernation for more than two years to conserve power before being woken up successfully in January this year. Interactive: See how Rosetta chases the comet across the solar system . Scientists hope to learn more about the composition of comets and perhaps whether they brought water to the Earth or even the chemicals that make up the building blocks of life. ""It really is such a step forward to anything that has come before,"" project scientist Matt Taylor told CNN. Rosetta will soon begin mapping the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and find out more about its gravitational pull. This will help to find a suitable landing site for Philae and allow engineers to keep Rosetta in the right orbit. As comets approach the sun, any ice melts and is turned into an ionized gas tail. The dust produces a separate, curving tail. It's these processes that Rosetta scientists hope to be able to study from close proximity. Taylor explained that the survey will show the team what the comet nucleus looks like now and when it gets closer to the sun. ""We'll be able to make a comparison to now, when its relatively inert, to when it's highly active ... making this measurement over a year when we're riding alongside at walking pace and observing how a comet works and interacts with the sun,"" he said. ""We are there for over a year to see this compete development to the extent that you may even be able to measure the decrease in the volume of the nucleus ... see how much material has left the comet."" Rosetta's target comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is known as a short-period comet. It reappears every six years as its orbit brings it close to the sun. Halley's comet has a period of about 76 years and is not due to return close enough to Earth to be visible until 2061. Others only return after thousands of years. Matt Taylor says it is unlikely that you will be able to see comet 67P with the naked eye but you can follow the progress of the mission on Rosetta's blog and find out more with CNN's interactive coverage.","If successful, the Rosetta mission will be the first to orbit and land on a comet .

"The parents of a woman killed during the Colorado theater shooting two years ago are suing four online retailers for negligence. The websites sold James Holmes the ammunition, body armor, tear gas and other equipment used when he opened fired in a packed Aurora movie theater during a July 2012 midnight showing of the Batman film ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence filed the lawsuit on behalf of Sandy and Lonnie Phillips, whose daughter Jessica Ghawi was shot and killed in the attack that left 12 dead and dozens wounded. The lawsuit alleges that Lucky Gunner, the Sportman's Guide, BulletProofBodyArmorHQ.com and BTP Arms negligently supplied Holmes. ""A crazed, homicidal killer should not be able to amass a military arsenal, without showing his face or answering a single question, with the simple click of a mouse,"" said a statement released by the Brady Center.  ""If businesses choose to sell military-grade equipment online, they must screen purchasers to prevent arming people like James Holmes."" The lawsuit says Lucky Gunner sold Holmes 4,000 rounds of ammunition.  The Sportman's Guide allegedly sold Holmes a 100-round drum ammunition magazine and 700 rounds.  The other vendors are said to have provided the other equipment used by Holmes. ""Two years ago when our daughter Jessica was murdered, and we first heard the details of the massacre, I asked my husband: 'How can anyone order over 4,000 rounds of ammunition without raising any red flags? Why weren't any questions asked of the person who bought all of this ammunition?"" said Sandy Phillips. ""As gun owners, parents, and citizens of this country, we hope that our lawsuit will spare other families the tragedy that we have gone through after the death of our beautiful daughter."" Remembering the victims . Trial on hold . Holmes' trail was scheduled to begin in October, but has been delayed. A psychiatrist conducting a second sanity examination on Holmes asked for more time to complete the examination, according to a judge's order from Arapahoe County District Court made public over the summer. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the 166 charges he faces in connection with the rampage. This is the third time the trial has been delayed. It was originally set to begin in August 2013 but was pushed back to February. That date was then delayed until October, which has now been postponed.

"A common benchmark in the United States for determining when a driver is legally drunk is not doing enough to prevent alcohol-related crashes that kill about 10,000 people each year and should be made more restrictive, transportation safety investigators say. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended on Tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood-alcohol content (BAC) cutoff of 0.05 compared to the 0.08 standard on the books today and used by law enforcement and the courts to prosecute drunk driving. ""Most Americans think that we've solved the problem of impaired driving, but in fact, it's still a national epidemic,"" NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said. The idea for a tighter standard is part of a safety board initiative outlined in a staff report and approved by the panel to eventually eliminate drunk driving, which accounts for about a third of all road deaths in the United States. NTSB looks to technology to end drunken driving in the U.S. Hersman said progress has been made over the years to reduce drunk driving, including a range of federal and state policies, tougher law enforcement, and stronger advocacy. But she said too many people are still dying on America's roads. The board acknowledged that there was ""no silver bullet,"" but that more action is needed at the federal and state levels. ""In the last 30 years, more than 440,000 people have perished in this country due to alcohol-impaired driving. What will be our legacy 30 years from now?"" Hersman asked. ""If we don't tackle alcohol-impaired driving now, when will we find the will to do so?"" Lowering the rate to 0.05 would save about 500 to 800 lives annually, the safety board  said. Under current law, a 180-pound male typically will hit the 0.08 threshold after four drinks over an hour, according to an online blood alcohol calculator published by the University of Oklahoma. That same person could reach the 0.05 threshold after two to three drinks over the same period, according to the calculator. Supreme Court rules against police in drunk driving case . Many factors besides gender and weight influence a person's blood alcohol content, and many states outlaw lower levels of inebriation when behind the wheel. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents and advocates on safety issues. It cannot impose its will through regulation and can only recommend changes to federal and state agencies or legislatures, including Congress. But the independent agency is influential on matters of public safety and its decisions can spur action from like-minded legislators and transportation agencies nationwide. States set their own BAC standards. The board also recommended on Tuesday that states vastly expand laws allowing police to swiftly confiscate licenses from drivers who exceed the blood alcohol limits. And it is pushing for laws requiring all first-time offenders to have ignition locking devices that prevent cars from starting until breath samples are analyzed. In the early 1980s, when grass-roots safety groups brought attention to drunk driving, many states required a 0.15 BAC rate to demonstrated intoxication. But over the next 24 years, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other groups pushed states to adopt the 0.08 BAC standard, the last state falling in line in 2004. The number of alcohol-related highway fatalities, meanwhile, dropped from 20,000 in 1980 to 9,878 in 2011, the NTSB said. Drunk-drive blood tests divide Supreme Court . In recent years, about 31 percent of all fatal highway accidents were attributed to alcohol impairment, the NTSB said. ""I think .05 is going to come. How long it takes to get there, we don't know. But it will happen,""   said the NTSB's Robert Molloy, who helped guide the staff report. For some, the vote struck close to home. NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt noted that one of his relatives had been killed by a drunk driver and another is serving a 15-year sentence in a related death. Many of the recommendations ""are going to be unpopular,"" Sumwalt said. ""But if we keep doing what we're doing, we're not going to make any difference."" The NTSB cited research that showed most drivers experience a decline in both cognitive and visual functions with a BAC of 0.05. Currently, more than 100 countries on six continents have BAC limits set at 0.05 or lower, the safety board said. The NTSB has asked all 50 states to do the same. CDC: Teen drinking and driving rates cut in half . A restaurant trade association, the American Beverage Institute, attacked the main recommendation, saying the average woman reaches 0.05 percent BAC after consuming one drink. The group said it based that conclusion on a chart it said was used by auto safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). But NHTSA told CNN on Tuesday it no longer uses that chart ""as there are many variables"" that contribute to an individual's level of intoxication. A new NHTSA chart shows a person with a 0.05 BAC level experiences ""reduced coordination, reduced ability to track moving objects, difficulty steering, (and) reduced response to emergency driving situations."" A beer industry trade group said it would examine NTSB's recommendation for lowering the blood-alcohol threshold. ""However, we strongly encourage policymakers to direct their efforts where we know we can get results: by focusing on repeat offenders and increasing penalties on those with BAC of (0.15) or more,"" said Joe McClain, president of the Beer Institute. The safety board also recommend that NHTSA provide financial incentives to states to carry out the changes. NHTSA, which oversees highway safety as a federal regulator and analyzes traffic crash data, said it would work with any state that wants to pursue a lower BAC standard to ""gather further information on that approach."" At Tuesday's meeting, the safety board also championed laws allowing police to confiscate a motorist's license at the time of arrest if the driver exceeds a BAC limit, or refuses to take the BAC test. Some 40 states already use the administrative tool, which the NTSB believes is effective because it is swift and immediate. And the board recommended more widespread use of passive alcohol sensors, which police can use to ""sniff"" the air during a traffic stop to determine the presence of alcohol. The sensor is capable of detecting alcohol even in cases where the driver has attempted to disguise his breathe with gum or mints.  If the sensor alerts, it is grounds for more thorough testing. The NTSB recommended last December that states require ignition interlocks for all DUI offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance. Tuesday's recommendations were timed to coincide with the deadliest alcohol-related crash in U.S. history.  On May 14, 1988, a drunk driver drove his pickup the wrong way on Interstate 71 near Carrollton, Kentucky.  The truck hit a school bus, killing 24 children and three adults. More than 30 others were hurt. What sways teens not to drink, drive? Stories, not stats .","For a decade, 0.08 has been the blood alcohol benchmark to consider a driver intoxicated .

"Los Angeles police are looking into a possible connection between a Canadian porn actor suspected in the mutilation of a university student and the killing of a California man who was dismembered in the same grisly manner. In January, a woman walking on a hilltop trail near the famed Hollywood sign discovered a freshly severed head. Police scoured the area and found human hands and feet and identified the victim as Hervey Medellin, 66. Parts of Medellin's body are still missing. Officer Cleon Joseph of the Los Angeles police said reporters have asked detectives whether Medellin's killing was linked in any way to Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, suspected of killing Chinese student Jun Lin in Montreal. The sick fascination with a death video . Joseph said police do not have any evidence that establishes a connection between the two crimes. Montreal police told the Toronto Sun newspaper that Magnotta may have been in Los Angeles at the time of Medellin's killing. After a massive manhunt, Magnotta was arrested Monday in a Berlin Internet cafe. He is awaiting extradition to Canada to face first-degree murder charges. In the grisliest Montreal crime in years, police say they suspect the porn actor killed and dismembered Lin and posted a 10-minute video of it online. Montreal police Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere said the video shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts and also included evidence of cannibalism. Police say they believe Magnotta sent Lin's body parts by mail to political party headquarters in Ottawa and two schools in Vancouver, British Columbia. Magnotta then fled Montreal for Europe. Lin's distraught family traveled from their village in China to Montreal this week. Lafreniere said the family had little money and people had stepped up to help. On Friday, Concordia University, where Lin was studying, announced the Jun Lin Family Fund, which will absorb funds from the Lin Jun Rest in Peace Foundation announced by the Chinese consulate in Montreal a day earlier, university spokeswoman Christine Mota said. The Jun Lin Family Fund will provide financial assistance to the Lin family, and the school is also creating the Jun Lin Award to benefit Chinese students studying at the university after the family said they wanted something good to come out of Lin's killing, Mota said.

"Japanese began voting Sunday in parliamentary elections described by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as a referendum on his flagship economic policies. Abe called for the snap election last month, following news that the country had unexpectedly slipped into recession, dealing a blow to his much-vaunted ""Abenomics"" -- the stimulus and economic reform package he introduced since taking power in 2012. ""The election will be held to ask the public whether we will (move) forward with Abenomics or end it,"" Abe said when announcing the closure of parliament in November. Recent polls have shown that Abe's Liberal Democratic Party has a strong lead over the main opposition party but turnout is expected to be low. Strange timing . An election wasn't required until late 2016, which has led to considerable speculation as to why Abe, with a sizable majority in the lower house -- 295 out of the 475 seats -- would risk ceding power so early. E. Keith Henry, analyst and founder of Asia Strategy, a Tokyo-based government policy consultancy, said he found the timing ""puzzling."" ""Why call an election when you have such a dominant position?"" Indeed, polls suggest that a majority of the public don't understand why Abe is calling an election at this time, and are critical of the decision to incur the cost during another period of recession. Voter turnout is expected to be low. Polls put support for the ruling (LDP) at around 30%, with between 10% and 13% support for the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the main opposition party. The LDP has been in power nearly constantly since 1955. During this period, the DPJ have only governed twice, briefly in the 1990s and again from 2009 to 2012.

Ultimately, Abe's election gamble will pay off if he can convince the average salaryman or woman that his economic policies will benefit ordinary Japanese. While a key component of Abenomics has been extra government spending, a sales tax hike this year and rising costs have taken their toll on small businesses and their customers. In a bit to boost his election fortunes, Abe delayed a sales tax hike planned for October 2015. His special adviser on economic affairs, Etsuro Honda, has called for a further $25 billion in cash handouts and tax cuts to kickstart the economy. But it's not clear whether this will be enough to satisfy voters.

Indiana State Fair stage collapseJessica Silas Jessica Silas was in the bleachers on August 13, 2011, waiting for the popular country duo Sugarland to perform, when she saw dust blowing and heard people starting to yell. She pulled out her video camera just seconds before the stage collapsed and killed seven people in the crowd. Why it was chosen: . Burt Herman, Storify co-founder:""The video captures the entire event as it happened from a perspective where you can see everything. It's chilling to see the panicked reactions after the stage collapsed and gives you a sense of being there and feeling the horror that the audience felt."" Vadim Lavrusik, Facebook journalist program manager:""Because she was able to capture the key moment of the collapse, she's able to tell the very core of the story. Not only was this video timely and captured dramatic footage, but was impressively shot with composure and without panic. A great reporter is able to keep calm amid the chaos to capture the story. Silas keeps the camera steady, and even zooms several times to get closer footage of the damage, all while people are running for their lives around her. Brooke Baldwin, CNN anchor:""This video communicates the sheer terror of this stage collapse. I felt like I was there."" Andrea Allen, Vimeo director of production and community:""I reviewed every entry twice, and my top three entries three times each. This was the only story that never lost its initial shock."" Original reporting . Return to South SudanRoseann Dennery Roseann Dennery was working for the aid organization Samaritan's Purse in Haiti when she was sent to southern Sudan to document the historic referendum dividing the country. She was in the Bahr el Ghazal region in southern Sudan when a bus full of people arrived after years in exile. She said the first man she spoke to had fled 15 years ago and only came back after the historic referendum. Why it was chosen:Issa Rae, Writer/Producer/Director at Issa Rae Productions: .

Vadim Lavrusik:""The narrative is detailed and provides context about some of the broader history for readers. It also has a strong personal perspective from the author, which makes the reader feel very much a part of the story. The narrative arc keeps the reader engaged and the story ends nicely. On top of the written story, the photographs help visualize the scene and the characters."" Compelling imagery . Occupy Wall Street, day 23Anna and Rachel OttoAnna Otto and her 14-year-old twin sister Rachel got their father to take them to New York so they could be a part of the Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park. They edited their video of the experience into a creative and energetic music video. Why it was chosen: . Burt Herman:""This vignette of the Occupy protests gives a nice panorama on the protesters and what they represent."" Vadim Lavrusik:""The video is newsworthy as this movement took the country by storm and spread to other parts of the world, and demonstrates some great instincts in editing and production. In many ways, the video - with protest signs, protesters and conditions - shows the story behind the movement: a protest against the 1% and the income gap."" Commentary . Ode to BordersMelissa FazliMelissa Fazli was disappointed when her local Borders closed as the bookstore chain went out of business. She didn't really shop there, but said it was a nice place to meet people and it had nice activities for her children.

"A truck pulling a flatbed trailer rolled on Interstate 10 in Mississippi, leading to a accident involving several vehicles that left four people dead and four with moderate injuries, a police spokesman said. The accident occurred around midnight Friday as the 2011 Toyota Tundra was traveling eastbound in Hancock County, west of Biloxi and 12 miles from the Louisiana state line, Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman Benjamin Seibert said. Four 18-wheeler trucks and six cars crashed after the Toyota truck lost its load on the highway as it rolled over, according to Seibert. The police spokesman said weather was not a factor. Eastbound traffic on I-10 shut down for several hours after the accident, though everything had reopened by 7 a.m., said Johnny Poulos, another highway patrol spokesman.","Interstate 10 reopens eastbound after being closed for several hours .

"The Senate approved a $1.1 trillion spending measure Saturday night funding most of the government through September, removing the threat of a shutdown for much of 2015. The bipartisan 56-40 vote sends the bill to President Barack Obama, who is expected to sign it into law. Passage closes a chapter of yet another fiscal battle on Capitol Hill. It came after attempts to delay the legislation by liberals who sought to strip out a policy provision that eases a Wall Street regulation and conservatives who tried to slow action on immigration. In fact, the Senate would not have been in session this weekend if it hadn't been for a small band of conservatives who sabotaged an agreement by Democratic Leader Harry Reid and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who wanted to vote on the bill Monday. In a late Friday night procedural sneak attack, carried out after McConnell left the Capitol, the group led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, forced the Senate to stay.  They also pressed to get a vote on a measure to declare the bill unconstitutional because it funds what they say is ""illegal amnesty"" included in the President's recent executive orders on immigration. The move by rank-and-file members to undermine an agreement between the Senate leaders is highly unusual and may reflect the difficulty incoming majority leader McConnell will face managing the Senate when the new Congress convenes next month. Cruz defended his actions. ""Every Republican candidate all across the country said we'll do everything humanly possible to stop President Obama's illegal amnesty.  We're honoring those commitments,"" Cruz said as he shuttled between strategy sessions in the Capitol with his cohorts Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana, and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama. ""They're going to get nothing out of this,"" said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who, like a lot of senators, was frustrated by Cruz's tactics and predicted he would not succeed in scuttling the bill.  ""This is absolute utter nonsense for us to be here."" Cruz ultimately did receive a vote challenging the funding bill because it included money for the Department of Homeland Security, which is carrying out the President's recent executive actions on immigration.  Cruz and other Republicans say the President's orders are unconstitutional. Though his challenge failed, the senator wanted a vote to ""ensure that every senator will be on record regarding the constitutionality of President Obama's illegal amnesty,"" Catherine Frazier, Cruz's press secretary, emailed reporters early Saturday ahead of the vote. Democrats took advantage of the Saturday session to begin procedure votes on 24 nominations, including some controversial ones like Sarah Saldaña for director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Vivek Murthy for surgeon general, and Carolyn Colvin for commissioner of the Social Security Administration. A senior Democratic leadership aide said some of the nominees would most likely have not received a vote because of timing and senators leaving for the holidays. ""We gave away literally nothing, and we got a number of nominees we would not have been able to confirm if we hadn't been in session today,"" the aide said. Before the unusual weekend session, much of the drama over the spending bill was in the House, where Republican Speaker John Boehner and Obama formed an unusual alliance to quell their own parties' rebellions -- led on the left by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D- Massachusetts. All the maneuvering was an ominous sign of what's to come now that this Congress is wrapping up its work and a new one is set to start in January. Boehner and soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader McConnell are still struggling to rein in tea party conservatives who are itching for more showdowns over Obama's immigration policies, the health care law, the debt ceiling and more. And Democrats who had been loyal to Obama now find they no longer need the President, especially since many of the party's more centrist members lost their seats in a midterm election that saw Republicans gain control of the Senate and expand their advantage in the House. ""This by definition was a compromise bill. This is what is produced when you have a divided government that the American people voted for,"" Obama told reporters Friday. ""Had I been able to draft my own legislation, get it passed without any Republican votes, I suspect it would be slightly different,"" he said. ""That is not the circumstance we find ourselves in and I think what the American people very much are looking for is responsible governance and the willingness to compromise, and that's what we've clearly done,"" Obama added. Beyond keeping the government open, the spending bill includes dozens of far-reaching policy provisions. It blocks a voter-approved law in the District of Columbia, that legalizes marijuana and blunts a school lunch program championed by first lady Michelle Obama.","The 1.1 trillion spending measure passes the Senate with a vote of 56:40 .

"(CNN) -- When you click on nude pictures of celebrities or ISIS videos of beheadings, you're part of the problem. At the very least, you're complicit in the moral crime committed by those who post such pictures or videos. At worst, you're actively perpetuating the incentives behind posting such things in the first place. Want to be a responsible and considerate human being? Then for crying out loud, don't click on those things! This week hackers released what they say are nude pictures of celebrity women, including Kim Kardashian, Vanessa Hudgens, Rihanna and Mary-Kate Olsen. These photos came on the heels of other leaked nude photos, also of celebrity women, which must have gotten enough attention to make the hackers want to do it again. Opinion: Who's at fault over nude photo hack? A week before, ISIS posted another video claiming to show the beheading of a British aid worker. The video -- mind you, not just its existence but people actually seeing it -- fueled the same sort of revenge mindset in Britain that previous such videos fueled in the United States. President Obama himself has noted that the videos in which ISIS beheads American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff ""resulted in the American public's quickly backing military action."" Yesterday, another such video was posted of ISIS supporters in Algeria beheading a French tourist. Media outlets have struggled with whether to broadcast photos and videos that are on the one hand newsworthy -- and incidentally, salacious and thus, traffic-generating -- but on the other hand may perpetuate the harm or offense committed in the first place. For instance, CNN didn't air the Foley video, opting instead to show only a few images and audio. Some news organizations, however, were less restrained. Speaking with Brian Stelter on ""Reliable Sources"" about the latest ISIS video showing British journalist James Cantlie speaking in captivity, CNN International managing director Tony Maddox said, ""We know that ISIS wanted us to show it. And if we're in a situation where ISIS wants us to show anything, we should think really carefully about any way we can avoid doing that."" Let that sink in for a moment: ISIS wants you to watch those videos. The hackers who stole the celebrity pictures want you to look at them. When you click, you're doing precisely what the bad guys want you to do. Opinion: Will ISIS brutality backfire? This summer, I gave a TED Talk about the changing landscape of American media and how we the consumers are becoming the new editors. Because online traffic performance drives media in the digital age, our clicks matter more than ever before. I used to think writing essays like this or going on television is a public act of making media, but that browsing the Web at home, clicking on this and that, is a private act of consuming media. Wrong. Clicking is a public act of making media because it feeds what gets attention. Your clicks matter. I imagine that most Americans wouldn't buy things they knew had been stolen out of someone else's home. Isn't clicking on stolen photos the same thing? Or worse? The Guardian's Van Badham writes that clicking on or sharing stolen celebrity nude photos is ""an act of sexual violation"" that in effect perpetuates the abuse of the theft in the first place. The Daily Beast's Marlow Stern writes that some actively spreading the pictures online feel so entitled to violate these celebrity women's privacy that they imply the celebrities might have leaked the pictures themselves -- as though all the slut-shaming and misogyny would be an enjoyable PR boost. Opinion: Keep nude photos offline? Here's another idea . Let's be clear, even if you aren't the scuz-bucket making rape jokes in chat rooms, just by curiously clicking on these nude celebrity pictures you're giving the hackers attention and the publishers traffic. You're basically encouraging them to keep doing it. By the same token, I know most Americans would never want to support or encourage the murderous ISIS extremists. But does public obsession with and outrage around ISIS beheading videos do just that? Analyzing the political and psychological motives for beheadings, the Boston Globe's Jeff Jacoby writes, ""Clearly the terrorists relish the horror beheading evokes in America and other Western democracies."" Beheading Americans naturally provokes that very human reaction. Still, if we had only heard about Foley and Sotloff being beheaded, would it have generated the same attention and outrage? Or was it the videos, or even just the still images from the videos, that incited and inflamed our anger? According to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, in 2013, 78% of Americans had heard about the Supreme Court's Obamacare decision, 77% of Americans were aware of the debt ceiling fight in Congress, and 79% of Americans had heard about the alleged use of chemical weapons by Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. But fully 94% of Americans were aware that ISIS killed James Foley. How much is the tail of these deeply vile and upsetting videos wagging the dog of our emotions and prompting us to military action? In my TED Talk, I said that clicking on a train wreck ""just pours gasoline on it and makes it worse."" The result? ""Our whole culture gets burned."" If in our new media-driven universe, what gets the most clicks wins, ""we have to shape the world we want with our clicks."" The good news there is that you -- yes you -- have the power as just one individual to decide what we see more of or what we see less of in the media; to discourage disgusting videos and pictures and encourage positive, productive media coverage. That is an incredible and important power. Use it wisely. Click responsibly.","Sally Kohn: Don't click on nude photos of celebrities or ISIS videos of beheadings .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Just when you thought the nation's entertainment capital couldn't deliver a new surprise ending, a camera-wielding resident reveals how this week's Pacific storm sent Los Angeles a tornado. The rare twister was captured on tape: roofs obliterated, shingles hurled like leaves, and the amateur videographer gasping in profane disbelief. Friday's melee even damaged the steel of a billboard. ""It was crazy. It was crazy,"" Jamie Mena told CNN affiliate KABC after shooting a video of bent-over palm trees and his rooftop flying off. ""I am shaken up."" Before Friday, the last time a twister made big news in Los Angeles was 1983, slamming into the downtown Los Angeles Convention Center, though there have been a few tornadoes since then around the area. ""They are pretty rare, but not as rare as you might think, though,"" said National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Sukup of the Los Angeles-Oxnard office. Los Angeles hasn't seen a tornado for the past few years, but a study in the 1990s showed that ""the amount of tornadoes we get in the L.A. basin is comparable to what they get in the Midwest but it's much weaker,"" Sukup said. ""Most of the ones we get out here are EF0's, whereas out in the Midwest, they get the EF3's and larger,"" Sukup said. On a tornado damage scale, an EF0 is the weakest, with three-second gusts between 65 and 85 mph, according to the service. The worst of tornadoes is ranked EF5, with the winds exceeding 200 mph. An EF3 has such gusts between 136 and 165 mph. That means Friday morning's twister in south Los Angeles struck with winds between 65 mph and 85 mph, ripping two residential roofs and knocking over trees, the service said. The tornado was born out of a Pacific storm that pummeled much of the coast from Wednesday to Friday. What to know about tornadoes . More tornadoes ahead? One of the more memorable tornado seasons in Los Angeles was the 1997-1998 winter when a strong El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon brought several storms and weak twisters, Sukup said. An El NiÃ±o event involves the warming of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean and influences the jet stream where storms track. ""We might be going into a weak El NiÃ±o this year, but it doesn't tell us how wet of a year we're going to have or how many storms we're going to have,"" Sukup said. More rain will fall on Southern California beginning late Sunday, and Los Angeles may received a quarter- to a half-inch of rain on Monday, with a chance of showers through the week, Sukup said. Rain resumes next week . But next week's rainfall shouldn't cause the kind of disasters seen this past week, Sukup said. At a minimum, those rains will help slake a historic drought that's been drying up California the past three years. ""It doesn't look like it's going to be a major deal, more of a beneficial rain,"" Sukup said of next week's forecast. The recent storms flooded and ravaged the West Coast: homes fell into the sea in Washaway Beach, Washington; schools closed pre-emptively in San Francisco and Oakland; a landslide buried houses in Camarillo; and a long balcony of second-floor apartments collapsed upon ground-level storefronts in Long Beach. No one in California was killed, but falling trees killed two people in Oregon and left a third seriously injured, authorities said. Now comes the cleanup . On Saturday, California experienced lingering damage and sporadic power outages, but for the most part, the state had recovered, said Kelly Huston, deputy director of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services. ""Widespread outages are pretty much gone,"" Huston said Saturday. ""What we're seeing is the cleanup part of the process for us. ""It was a bad storm for us,"" Huston said. ""Luckily, we didn't suffer as many of the impacts as we thought we might have."" California rescuers saved people trapped in a mobile home park, in the Los Angeles River and a few other spots. Northern California got the worst of the storm Thursday, as evidenced by swaying Bay Area bridges, halted ferry and cable car services around San Francisco and blizzard-like conditions in the Sierra Nevada mountains. On Friday, it was more Southern California's turn. Several spots in the region had record rainfall for the day, including 2.36 inches in Oxnard and 1.54 inches at Long Beach's airport. A storm like this -- the biggest to hit the area in years -- leaves a big mess behind, from flooded roadways to damaged houses to lives disrupted or turned entirely upside down. Thankfully, in California at least, the vast majority of the once 300,000 customers left in the dark now have their power back on. And Huston said that, as bad as this storm was, ""it was not quite as bad as we expected."" Even then, there's still a lot to do Saturday to get things back to normal. But this time, at least, Mother Nature should cooperate. ""We're looking pretty good,"" Huston told CNN. ""We're hoping for some sunshine today here in California, and that will (help in) the cleanup process going on in several parts of the state.""","NEW: Tornadoes are rare in Los Angeles but not as scarce as you think, meteorologist says .

"The death toll from a landslide that struck a village in central Java Friday, burying dozens of homes, has risen to 39, Indonesian authorities say. Days of heavy rains triggered a rush of mud, rocks and trees from the mountains overlooking Java's Banjarnegara District on Friday evening. Sixty-nine people remain unaccounted for, the country's disaster management agency said. The landslide buried at least 105 houses in and near Sampang village, the Antara state news agency reported. At least 15 people were injured by the landslide, 11 of them seriously, and close to 600 people have been evacuated. Video from local television showed muddy water still rushing along paths of the landslide Saturday. A wall of newly fallen earth -- at least 15 feet tall, judging by the men standing at the base -- blocked a paved road. Elsewhere, people tried to gather belongings from a wooden house that had been torn open by the debris. Still more footage showed dozens of people, some crying, gathered Friday night at a hospital where injured had been taken. The military, local Red Cross officials, police, volunteers, and the national search and rescue agency joined in a rescue mission in the affected area, the disaster management agency said. But it was later suspended due to pouring rain. Friday's landslide came a day after two other slides killed two people in or near Banjarnegara District, Antara reported. One of Thursday's slides, in Banjarnegara's Wanayasa area, displaced more than 350 people, according to the state news outlet. Landslides and flash floods are seasonal occurrences in the Southeast Asian archipelago, where mountainous terrain and heavy rains make for prime slide conditions. Satellite data appears to show parts of central Java have received about 200 millimeters (7.9 inches) of rain so far this month. That would be roughly the amount that the area gets on average the entire month of December. More showers are expected in the area in coming days. It wasn't clear exactly how much rain fell Friday in Banjarnegara District. But about 95 kilometers (60 miles) to the southwest, some 108 millimeters (4.25 inches) of rainfall was reported in the Java port city of Cilicap on Friday.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama lifted all restrictions Monday on the ability of individuals to visit relatives in Cuba, as well as to send them remittances. The changes in Cuban policy was unveiled before President Obama's trip to the Summit of the Americas. The move represents a significant shift in a U.S. policy that had remained largely unchanged for nearly half a century. It comes days before Obama leaves for a key meeting of hemispheric powers, the Summit of the Americas, in Trinidad and Tobago. ""President Obama has directed that a series of steps be taken to reach out to the Cuban people to support their desire to enjoy basic human rights and to freely determine their country's future,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Obama also ordered new steps to promote the ""freer flow of information among the Cuban people and between those in Cuba and the rest of the world, as well as to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian items directly to the Cuban people,"" Gibbs added. The president took ""these steps [in part] to help bridge the gap among divided Cuban families."" Obama believes that the change in U.S. policy will ultimately help bring about a more tolerant, democratic Cuban government, noted White House Latin American policy adviser Dan Restrepo. He thinks ""that creating independence, creating space for the Cuban people to operate freely from the regime is the kind of space they need to start the process toward a more democratic Cuba,"" Restrepo said. Several key components of America's embargo on the island nation will be preserved, however. Among other things, Americans will still be barred from sending gifts or other items to high-ranking Cuban government officials and Communist Party members. Travel restrictions for Americans of non-Cuban descent will also remain in place. Critics of the change blasted the administration for unilaterally changing what had been a long-settled U.S. policy. President Raúl Castro's ""dictatorship is one of the most brutal in the world. The U.S. economic embargo must remain in place until tyranny gives way to freedom and democracy,"" Rep. Connie Mack, R-Florida, said in a written statement. Obama ""should not make any unilateral change in America's policy toward Cuba. Instead, Congress should vigorously debate these and other ideas before any substantive policy changes are implemented."" Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Florida, and a native of Cuba, had kinder words for the administration, saying, ""The announcement today is good news for Cuban families separated by the lack of freedom in Cuba."" He said that, in turn, the Cuban government should focus on improving its relationships with its citizens and the United States. ""Lowering remittance charges and allowing travel for Cuban families wishing to see relatives abroad are two steps the Cuban regime could immediately take that would show change in Havana,"" he said. Reps. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, and Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, held a news conference last week urging Obama to refrain from easing trade embargo or travel restrictions until the Cuban government releases all ""prisoners of conscience,"" shows greater respect for freedom of religion and speech, and holds ""free and fair"" elections. ""Over the past 50 years, the Castros and their secret police have been directly responsible for killing thousands of nonviolent, courageous pro-democracy activists and for jailing and torturing tens of thousands of others. And they continue to this day to perpetrate their brutal crimes,"" Smith said. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, responded that it makes no sense to continue what she characterized as a failed policy.  Watch report on easing of travel restrictions » . ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but by any objective standard, our current policy toward Cuba just hasn't worked. Simply put, it's time to open dialogue and discussion with Cuba,"" she said in a written statement. Lee and other Congressional Black Caucus members met in Havana this month with Raúl Castro and his brother, former President Fidel Castro. Several members of Congress see broader relations with Cuba as vital to U.S. interests. A group of senators and other supporters unveiled a bill March 31 to lift the 47-year-old travel ban to Cuba. ""I think that we finally reached a new watermark here on this issue,"" said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota, one of the bill's sponsors. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, another sponsor of the bill, issued a draft report in February that said it was time to reconsider the economic sanctions. Lugar is the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Sarah Stephens, director of the Cuba Travel Projects and one of the leading advocates pushing for an end to the embargo, said Monday that ""these are welcome steps, but the right course is to allow all Americans to travel to Cuba, to open up commerce and to directly engage the Cuban government in diplomacy and solving problems in both countries' interests.""  Watch report on whether Cuba is ready for U.S. tourists » . Obama ""has a historic opportunity not to be the last president of the Cold War but the first president to turn the page in U.S.-Cuba relations,"" she argued. Before he was elected president, Obama promised to lower some of the barriers in Cuban-American relations. Provisions attached to a $410 billion supplemental budget Obama signed in March also made it easier for Cuban-Americans to travel to Cuba and to send money to family members on the island. In addition, they facilitated the permitted sales of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. The provisions loosened restrictions enacted by President George W. Bush after he came to office in 2001. Obama's moves appear to be tracking the overall public sentiment on what has historically been a hot-button political issue. Seventy-one percent of Americans think the United States should re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba, according an April 3-5 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, and 64 percent think the United States should lift the travel ban to Cuba for all Americans. Sampling error for the poll was plus or minus 3 percentage points.","Restrictions lifted on travel to see relatives in Cuba, send remittances .

"[Breaking news update, 10:07 p.m. ET] . The U.S. Senate passed a $1.1 trillion spending bill that will fund the government through September, approving it in an unusual Saturday evening vote. [Previous story, 9:09 p.m. ET] . The Senate passed a short-term spending bill that will fund the government through Wednesday, averting a shutdown while the chamber debates a bill to fund the government. President Barack Obama signed the stopgap funding bill Saturday evening. Without it, funding was due to dry up Saturday night. The Senate will vote Saturday night on the $1.1 trillion package that would fund the government through next September, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on the Senate floor. The bill has already passed the House. Sen. Mitch McConnell,  the incoming Senate majority leader, had previously reached a deal with Reid to adjourn for the weekend and resume Monday to clear the bill. But in a surprise development, some of  McConnell's junior members defied the agreement after he left. Reid tried to get unanimous consent for an adjournment until Monday when there would be enough votes to end a filibuster, but Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, objected because Reid would not guarantee a vote on an amendment dealing with immigration funding. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas also joined the objection, forcing the Senate to meet on Saturday. Reid then announced to an almost empty chamber that the Senate would be in session beginning at noon Saturday. Will the government keep operating? The Senate was facing a Saturday deadline to approve the spending bill and avert a government shutdown, but that was pushed back. The chamber has been sifting through many of the same arguments that tied up the House on Thursday, when disagreements over immigration and provisions related to Wall Street and campaign finance nearly derailed the bill. Senate lawmakers wanted votes on amendments that would address those issues. Two votes are expected Monday: a procedural vote to block a filibuster and end debate on the bill, and a second one on the final passage. 'Using every tool available' Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, and Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, filed an amendment that would strip a provision that softens financial regulations on banks from the spending bill. ""Congress should not put taxpayers on the hook for another bailout, and this giveaway that was drafted by Citigroup lobbyists has no place in a critical government funding bill,"" Warren said. Cruz, a chief critic of Obama's recent executive action on immigration, also said he wanted a vote to block it. ""I think it is critical that the Senate have the opportunity to have a clear up or down vote on funding President Obama's illegal executive amnesty,"" he told reporters. ""I am using every tool available to help bring about that vote."" But by making the procedural move, Reid prevented those amendments from being considered. Amendment votes could have been risky, because if either measure passed, the spending bill would have to go back to the House to be voted on again. While the House is technically in session, most members have left Washington until the new Congress convenes in early January. A day after his administration scrambled to save the bill when it appeared it might be defeated in the House, the President said he was pulling for it in the Senate. ""I'm glad it passed the House and am hopeful that it will pass the Senate,"" Obama said.","Senate passes short-term funding measure .

"It's the thought that counts, right? Tell that to the residents of 32 homes in the Dutch town of Ijsselstein, who were evacuated after a planned marriage proposal fell through. A Dutchman rented a crane intending to reach his girlfriend's window Saturday morning and pop the question, Dutch affiliate RTL News said. Instead, the crane tipped over, crashing through the roof of a neighboring home. Hours later, during an attempt to right the crane, it fell through the roof again, making the hole bigger. As a result, residents of 32 homes were evacuated as a recovery company made another attempt to stabilize the crane. The good news? No one was injured, and she said yes.

"Two American soldiers and at least 19 Afghans were killed in a spate of attacks in Afghanistan Friday and Saturday, some of which were claimed by the Taliban, officials said. The violence began Friday, when a bomb explosion hit a convoy of NATO-led International Security Assistance Force troops. Two American soldiers were killed in that blast, a U.S. defense official said Saturday on condition of anonymity. ISAF, which also reported the attack but did not release the nationalities of the victims, said the attack happened in eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban claimed responsibility. Spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid tweeted that a U.S. convoy had been targeted in Bagram district and claimed five Americans were killed. On Saturday morning, 12 Afghan civilians who were clearing mines in southern Helmand province died in an attack, according to Omar Zwak, a spokesman for the provincial governor. The civilians were defusing devices planted by the Taliban to target military tanks and vehicles in an area between Shorabak and Nad Ali districts of southern Helmand, he said. Afghan security forces who arrived at the scene of the attack killed three of the militants and arrested four others. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said those killed were soldiers and not genuine mine-clearers. Judicial official shot to death . Unknown gunmen in Kabul killed Atiquallah Raufi, head of the Afghan Supreme Court secretariat Saturday morning, said Hashmat Stanikzai, spokesman for Kabul's police chief. That afternoon, a suicide bomber targeted a bus carrying Afghan National Army personnel in the Guzargah area of Kabul on Saturday afternoon, said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry. Six army personnel were killed and 18 other people were injured, including two women bystanders, he said. The Taliban spokesman, Mujahid, claimed responsibility for the blast in an e-mail. He said that from now on, Taliban attacks against foreign and Afghan forces would be stepped up. Kabul residents fear for safety . In the past couple of months, the Taliban have targeted many Afghan National Army buses and other vehicles. Two days ago, a bus carrying army personnel to work was targeted by a suicide bomber. Five servicemen were killed and 12 more were injured. After many attacks on army buses, especially during the morning and evening rush-hour periods, Kabul residents are worried. Some have called on the Afghan Defense Ministry to change the way it transports army personnel. Hashmatullah, who witnessed Saturday's attack, said: ""The Defense Ministry should stop using big buses to avoid being an easy target, and its personnel should use different routes to commute to work."" He said that this way the lives of both army personnel and civilians who are traveling on the same roads would be saved. The Taliban issued a separate warning Saturday via Facebook to media critical of the group, saying ""that from now on (the Taliban) will not stay silent and tolerate their actions and by using every possible way attacks will be carried out against them so immorality is annihilated from its root in our country."" U.S. combat role ends . The continuing violence comes as Afghan forces prepare to take on greater responsibility for ensuring the country's security as international forces transition to a supporting role. At the end of December, U.S. forces will end their combat role in Afghanistan and instead focus on counterterrorism missions and training, advising and assisting Afghan troops. Nonetheless, nearly 11,000 U.S. troops will remain in Afghanistan in the beginning of 2015. American forces will drop to 5,500 in 2016 and by 2017 the coalition will consolidate to Kabul.

"(CNN) -- The first film adaptation of Veronica Roth's ""Divergent"" novels was one of the most popular new Hollywood franchises of 2014, grossing more than $150 million at the domestic box office. Now, fans can close out the year with a look at the much-anticipated sequel, ""Insurgent,"" which is due out March 2015. Shailene Woodley reprises the role of Tris, a teen living in a dystopian future where people are divided into categories based on character attributes. Tris and her fellow ""divergents,"" who don't fit into any of the categories, continue their struggle to survive as Jeanine Matthews (played by Kate Winslet) hunts them down. A trailer released this week shows a greater emphasis on action scenes this go-around. Fans of the trilogy might also notice that Tris has a pixie cut in this installment, even though the character's hair is not that short in the book. Woodley says director Robert Schwentke granted her request to keep her naturally short hair -- which she cut for her role in another young adult novel adaptation, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" -- instead of wearing a wig.

"(CNN) -- Tensions magnified among the world's top three economies over China's controversial new air defense zone. The issues range from disagreements on air space as well as disputed islands between China and Japan. On Saturday, China declared the creation of an air defense identification zone in the East China Sea, eliciting strong criticisms from the United States and its close ally, Japan. Both countries refuse to recognize China's newly created zone. What is China's ""Air Defense Identification Zone""? China released a map and coordinates that identify its air defense zone on November 23. It declared that aircraft in the area must report their flight plans to China, maintain two-way radio and clearly mark their nationalities on the aircraft. The new rules went into effect 10 a.m. that day, Xinhua reported. This space included a swath of the East China Sea, including a disputed island chain known as Daioyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. China vowed to ""adopt defensive emergency measures to respond to aircraft that do not cooperate in the identification or refuse to follow the instructions."" What is an ""Air Defense Identification Zone"" or ADIZ? The ADIZ is not a new concept. It's essentially a buffer zone outside a country's sovereign airspace. Several countries including the United States and Japan have established ADIZ in international airspace next to their nations. A foreign aircraft traveling in an ADIZ can be required to identify itself for entry into that country's airspace. It is unilaterally imposed, so it doesn't really have a legal basis and isn't based on negotiation with neighbors, said James Hardy, the Asia-Pacific Editor of IHS Jane's Defence Weekly. ""It's purpose is to give the country an early warning zone in which it can intercept potentially unfriendly aircraft."" What islands does China's ADIZ affect? The Chinese defense ministry said the new air defense zone was not directed toward a specific country. The map and coordinates released by China show the zone covers parts of the East China Sea, as well as the Daioyu/Senkaku islands. Japan and China both lay claims on Daioyu/Senkaku islands. And China's new zone overlaps with Japan's, which was formed on August 29, 1968. China contests the Japanese air defense zone as illegal, Zhang Junshe, who is with the Chinese Navy, told Xinhua. China also has stirred its South Korean neighbors. A reef called Ieodo in the Yellow Sea sits about 149 kilometers southwest of Korean and 287 kilometers east from China, and is partially covered by the Chinese ADIZ. The Koreans have established an Ocean Research Station on Ieodo. How have China's neighbors reacted? Japan on Sunday slammed the Chinese announcement, saying it had ""no validity whatsoever."" The nation's Minister for Foreign Affairs called China's measure ""profoundly dangerous acts that unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea, escalating the situation, and that may cause unintended consequences."" Opinion: Did China make strategic error with air zone? In South Korea, the nation's defense ministry spokesman, Kim Min-seok said the country's jurisdiction over Ieodo remains unchanged. ""China has unilaterally set up its ADIZ,"" Kim said. He said it overlaps with Korea's jurisdiction. The Korean government would fly over such areas without informing the Chinese side, he added. Sounds like an Asia conflict, so why is the U.S. involved? The United States interprets the ADIZ differently than China. As stated in Xinhua, China's new aircraft identification rules don't distinguish between aircraft flying through the zone with no intention of flying into China's airspace and those that do, the Center for Strategic and International Studies points out. This is not how the United States interprets the ADIZ, as stated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's on November 23: ""The United States does not apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign aircraft not intending to enter U.S. national airspace. We urge China not to implement its threat to take action against aircraft that do not identify themselves or obey orders from Beijing."" The United States has said it won't recognize the zone -- nor China's call that aircraft entering it identify themselves and file flight plans. ""Freedom of overflight and other internationally lawful uses of sea and airspace are essential to prosperity, stability, and security in the Pacific. We don't support efforts by any State to apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign aircraft not intending to enter its national airspace."" To the United States, the newly formed air zone becomes more than an island dispute between China and its longtime ally, Japan, but a controversy over international airspace. ""The U.S. is very concerned with freedom of navigation, whether that be sea or sky,"" said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of Flightglobal, an aviation and aerospace industries news site. What are countries doing in response to the new zone? After the United States thoroughly expressed its displeasure with China's ADIZ, two U.S. military aircraft flew into the newly claimed air defense zone without notifying China. The flight came just two days after China's announcement of its new zone. Meanwhile, a flurry of strong words have been exchanged amongst various countries. The United States' warning that the zone heightens the risk of ""misunderstanding and miscalculation"" drew a sharp Chinese rebuke, calling the U.S. remarks ""irresponsible."" U.S.: China claim of air rights over disputed islands 'creates risk of incident' In an editorial in state-run media Xinhua, one commentary writer denounced the U.S. and Japanese objections as a case of ""they can do it while China cannot,"" referring to the countries' existing ADIZ. China slams 'inappropriate' U.S. remarks on territorial dispute with Japan . South Korea and China defense officials are expected to hold talks this week regarding the overlapping ADIZ that includes Ieodo. Are commercial flights affected in China's new air defense zone? As defined by China's announcement, the air defense zone's requirements appear to apply to all aircraft. But details are murky. Such planes are probably not required from a legal perspective to notify China, but it might be a good idea from a safety perspective, said Waldron. In the meantime, Japanese airliners, All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan Airlines (JAL) announced Wednesday they would not submit flight plans for their flights through the affected areas. Back to the islands -- why have Diaoyu/Senkaku islands been so contentious? China says its claim on the islands extend back to 1400s, which was used as a staging point for Chinese fisherman. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. According to Xinhua, China and Japan ""agreed in 1978 to put the issue aside and solve it in the future."" The dispute intensified last year as protests erupted in China after Japan announced it had bought several of the disputed islands from private Japanese owners. Anti-Japanese demonstrations turned violent as protesters hurled bottles at the Japanese embassy in Beijing, overturned Japanese cars, ransacked Japanese stores and restaurants. What's so appealing about the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands? It's uninhabited and may look like a bunch of rocks. But ownership of the islands would allow for exclusive oil, mineral, and fishing rights in surrounding waters.

"Several Jamaican sprinters were banned for doping earlier this year and now a footballer from the Caribbean nation has been suspended. Jermaine Hue, a creative midfielder who has made more than 40 appearances for the national team, received a nine-month suspension after he tested positive for dexamethasone. But a stiffer penalty was given to the team doctor, Carlton Fraser. He was hit with a four-year punishment after ""having administered"" the corticosteroid, FIFA said in a statement on its website. The two were provisionally banned in August after Hue tested positive following Jamaica's World Cup qualifier at Honduras in June. Hue, 35, has spent most of his career with Jamaica's Harbour View but had brief stints with the Kansas City Wizards of the MLS and Sweden's Mjallby. According to a report in the Jamaica Observer in August, Fraser was a personal friend of the late Bob Marley and also treated the reggae great. The sanctions are a further blow to the 'Reggae Boyz' -- they sit last in their qualifying group with only two matches remaining. Former world-record holder in the 100 meters, Asafa Powell, and Sherone Simpson admitted to testing positive for banned substances in July, a month after double 200-meter Olympic gold medalist Veronica Campbell-Brown received a provisional ban.","Jamaican midfielder Jermaine Hue receives a nine-month ban for doping .

"(CNN) -- It takes a lot of guts to choose jewelry design over a career in medicine, but then, Janet Fredman isn't the kind of woman to shy away from challenges. Shunning the prospect of attending medical to follow her creative side, the young entrepreneur went about transforming a passion for handmade accessories into a flourishing design practice based in Zambia's capital, Lusaka. Despite the country's rich offering of gold and gemstones, Fredman opted for everyday materials such as wood, seeds and leather to make her pieces. The result is a stunning collection of rings, bracelets and necklaces that translate the beauty of Zambia into wearable art. ""[When] I started first making jewelry, it started as a hobby"", recalls Fredman. ""I started making jewelry out of beads, and then later went to study as a goldsmith."" She adds, ""after studying, I came back and then what I learned as a goldsmith I incorporated it with Zambian materials to make contemporary Zambian jewelry."" A visit to a Cape Town jewelry shop further inspired Fredman to dive headfirst into her new venture, and since January 2014, the business has provided both a rewarding and challenging experience. Still in her 20s, Fredman has impressed many with her success, but establishing a new business at a young age is never easy. ""Business has been going OK"", says Fredman. ""Sometimes it's slow and sometimes it's high -- [I'm] still trying to find my way, what to do, the how, the do's and the don'ts; still trying to figure it out."" Professional and sleek, Janet Fredman Designs has the appearance of a high value retailer -- but it's this very quality that has led some people to question the legitimacy of her work. ""They're like 'you're young, did you really make this?' or 'maybe you bought and maybe you're selling'"" she says. Nevertheless, Fredman remains unfazed. In fact, the talented designer shows no sign of slowing down. ""The hopes for my business is to grow it, so it becomes an empire, a jewelry empire everyone will be talking about.""

"A gang task force arrested a man early Saturday in connection with a shooting near a high school in Portland, Oregon, police said. A gunman had opened fire Friday on four people near Rosemary Anderson High School, then fled on foot with two other men, according to witnesses. Officers from the Portland Police Gang Enforcement Team stopped a vehicle overnight and arrested 22-year-old Lonzo Murphy, police said in a statement. They also recovered a handgun from the vehicle. Police have not said if they suspect Murphy was the shooter or one of the men who fled with the shooter. The wounded . When medical technicians arrived at Rosemary Anderson High School, all of the wounded were conscious and talking, police said in a statement. Three of the victims were taken to a local hospital. One victim, Taylor Zimmers, 16, is in critical condition. Two more, David Jackson-Liday, 20, and Labraye Franklin, 17, are in fair condition. A 17-year-old girl suffered a grazing wound in the shooting and was treated on the scene. ""All four gunshot victims are affiliated with the school,"" police said. The shooting . The shooting happened around 12:15 p.m. local time not far from the campus in north Portland, police spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson said. After being shot, at least three victims ran inside a school building, a caller told authorities. ""I saw him stumble into the school holding his stomach, he said my brother's name and then he fell on the ground,"" one student told CNN affiliate KATU. The suspect may be affiliated with a gang but it's not known if the shooting was gang-related or ""a personal beef,"" Simpson said. An argument may have preceded the shooting. The suspect was described as a male in his late teens or early 20s and he was accompanied by two other males in the same age range. They left the area quickly on foot, Simpson said. He said the police department's gang task force was investigating.  Agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also arrived to assist, he said. At-risk students . The school system website says Rosemary Anderson High enrolls about 200 at-risk students who ""have either been expelled or dropped out of public high school and many are homeless."" All the shooting victims were students at the school or had taken job training or been enrolled in other programs there, Simpson said. The victims were breathing, conscious and talking as they were transported to Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, Simpson said. The campus was locked down for a while but classes later resumed, Simpson said. Nearby Jefferson High School and Portland Community College were locked down as police sought the shooter, authorities said, but the lockdown was lifted after a few hours. Pastor: 'Heartbreaking' A man who said he's the pastor of one of the shooting victims told CNN affiliate KOIN that the shooting was ""heartbreaking."" ""The young man I know attends our church frequently,"" said Jason Nelson of Cornerstone Community Church of God in Christ. He called the victim ""a bright young man"" and said he did not believe he was involved in any criminal activity. ""You hear about shootings every day and when it comes close to your school it's heartbreaking,"" Nelson told KOIN. Another school shooting occurred about six months ago in the Portland area. One person was killed June 10 at Reynolds High School in Troutdale, about 12 miles east of Portland. One person was killed.","Police stopped the man in a vehicle; they found a handgun in the car .

"Lord Voldemort, the arch-villain in the Harry Potter series of books and films, has played an unlikely cameo in a diplomatic feud between China and Japan. China's foreign ministry spokeswoman on Tuesday accused a Japanese diplomat of being ""ignorant, unreasonable and arrogant"" after the two countries upped the stakes in their propaganda war by likening each other to the fictional evil wizard. China's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Liu Xiaoming, first made reference to the character in an opinion piece published by Britain's Daily Telegraph last week. It came in response to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's December 26 visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, where convicted war criminals are honored along with other war dead. The move incensed China, which suffered under Japan's military aggression in World War II, and regards the shrine as a symbol of Japan's imperial past . ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul,"" Liu wrote. In the best-selling series by British author J.K. Rowling, a horcrux is used by Voldemort to hide fragments of the soul in a bid to prolong life. Not to be outdone in this literary war of words, Liu's commentary was followed by another from Japan's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Keiichi Hayashi: . ""There are two paths open to China. One is to seek dialogue, and abide by the rule of law. The other is to play the role of Voldemort in the region by letting loose the evil of an arms race and escalation of tensions,"" he wrote in the same paper. The riposte prompted Chinese state media to warn ""a war of public opinion between China and Japan is now in full swing."" ""There are no flying cannonballs in the battlefield of public opinion, but it still requires the unity of the entire Chinese society to fight this war,"" The Global Times, a tabloid owned by the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece The People's Daily, said on its website on Tuesday. However, Internet users in both countries seemed amused rather than alarmed by the latest and surreal twist in the long-running diplomatic tit-for-tat. ""I think China and Japan are more like two kids who have not grown up,"" posted @Xiaowei Huang on China's popular Twitter-like platform Weibo. ""The method is refreshing and the cultural reference down to earth,"" said another Weibo user with the handle @luotiehang. In Japan, Twitter user @emtyusuke welcomed the debate: ""It is good to use wit and rhetoric to appeal each other's claim, without being overly emotional."" Abe's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine exacerbated tensions at a time when relations between Japan and China have been strained over the sovereignty of a set of islands in the East China Sea known as the Diaoyu islands in China and the Senkakus in Japan.","China's foreign ministry says Japanese diplomat ""ignorant, unreasonable and arrogant""

"Surprise, surprise, Japan and China are still not getting along. Fortunately, the battles have been strictly rhetorical, although both nations' military vessels and aircraft have navigated and scrambled ominously in the vicinity of the disputed islets in the East China Sea known as the Diaoyu islands in China and the Senkakus in Japan. But the bilateral spat could easily escalate over a miscalculation by officers on the scene. It's easy to forget that last week the two nations marked the 35th anniversary of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship. Under the circumstances, the lack of fanfare is understandable but it does seem a timely reminder of what might be possible. While diplomacy has not been effective yet in reviving that spirit of amity, damping down tensions, or in securing a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, finding a formula to execute a mutually acceptable climb down is essential to jump-start dialogue. Leaders of nations can help by shelving the bombast. Dialogue continues behind the scenes but this is against the backdrop of frosty admonitions and dangerous posturing. Is it possible to dial down the rhetoric and serve up a summit? Not anytime soon. Last month, President Xi warned Japan about its truculent stance on the disputed territories and, along with South Korean President Park Geun-hye, cold-shouldered Prime Minister Abe at regional conferences in October. Abe has stayed away from the Yasukuni Shrine -- a controversial monument to Japan's war dead -- but this olive branch has not been seized, and advisers say he will visit by the year's end, ensuring the impasse continues. OPINION: Japan honoring the dead or insulting the neighbors? There is a lot to worry about with this face off in the East China Sea, especially now that it has become laden with nationalist symbolism and the game of military ""chicken"" intensifies. For example, in February Japan claimed that a Chinese vessel locked its firing radar onto a Japanese ship. More recently a Chinese drone ventured into the disputed airspace, prompting Tokyo to warn that it would fire on subsequent drones if they ignore warnings to leave Japan's air defense identification space. China's response was blunt. ""If Japan takes enforcement measures such as shooting down aircraft, as it says it will, that would constitute a serious provocation, an act of war of sorts, and we would have to take firm countermeasures, and all consequences would be the responsibility of the side that caused the provocation,"" a defense ministry spokesman warned earlier this week. Abe issued his own warning in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on the same day, saying Japan would adopt a more assertive security posture and reassert its regional influence. ""There are concerns that China is attempting to change the status quo by force, rather than by rule of law. But if China opts to take that path, then it won't be able to emerge peacefully,"" he said. Subsequently, while reviewing Japan's Self Defense Forces last weekend, Abe said, ""We will express our intention as a state not to tolerate a change in the status quo by force. We must conduct all sorts of activities such as surveillance and intelligence for that purpose. ""The security environment surrounding Japan is becoming increasingly severe. This is the reality. You will have to completely rid yourselves of the conventional notion that just the existence of a defense force could act as a deterrent."" Referring to the security implications of ""Abenomics,"" which refers to the prime minister's brand of economic policies designed to revitalize a stagnant economy, Abe believes a resurgent Japan should play a more assertive leadership role in Asia to counter China's power in a region nervous about Beijing's military buildup, and fears about Washington's fitful engagement. Obviously, China disagrees about what the region expects and needs, believing that over time it will gain regional hegemony. Washington, meanwhile, is betting on a ""cooler heads prevail"" scenario and certainly doesn't want to go to war with China over the rocky islets. But the Obama-pivot, still waiting to happen, looks like a neo-containment policy, as does the exclusion of China from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations. Recent U.S.-Japanese joint amphibious landing drills may be a sensible precaution, but also they also contribute to the tit-for-tat cycle of provocations that roil regional relations. The nonprofit think tank Genron conducts an annual public opinion poll in both nations and this summer found that mutual perceptions are extremely negative, exceeding 90% in both countries. This is the worst result in nine years of polling and should serve as a wake up call for leaders in Beijing and Tokyo. It's time to show some real leadership. But not everyone is glowering. Genron hosted a bilateral conference in Beijing this past weekend featuring dozens of prominent experts, officials and politicians, aimed at promoting dialogue. Former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda (2007-08) advised leaders to avoid the dead-end of self-righteousness. He also urged Japan to ""overcome historical problems"" relating to its past aggression in Asia to regain dignity and meet international expectations. Given the urgent need for bilateral cooperation on a number of issues, Fukuda said it's time to act now to overcome differences and find common ground. Wise advice, but in the feverish flexing of patriotic impulses, are current leaders listening?","Tensions between China and Japan have been heightened in recent weeks .

"Forget the tuba and accordion. Put away the lederhosen, and keep the beer steins on the shelf. The vast majority of today's beer festivals have little in common with the traditional Oktoberfest celebration. As craft beer continues to rise in popularity, the trickle-down effect of that growth means more beer festivals popping up all over the United States. And the beer festivals of today offer a lot more than just drinking ales and lagers. Many offer live entertainment, educational workshops and even food pairings. Below are seven upcoming beer festivals that are setting the standard by which to measure all others. SavorNew York . Savor stands out from the pack with its thoughtful pairing of great food with exceptional (and often rare) beer. The festival takes place in New York this year, and apart from the chance to try great beer and food combinations, it gives attendees an opportunity to hang out and chat with the ""rock stars"" of the beer world. Chef Adam Dulye leads a team of culinary professionals who create the food pairings based on the flavor profiles of each beer being served. But perhaps the coolest thing about this event are the tasting salons, intimate educational (and drinking!) sessions where brewers speak on topics like ""blending a barrel-aged sour beer"" and ""a taste of Virginia from the Brew Ridge Trail."" The event takes place June 14 and 15, and tickets are on sale now. 8 best beer towns in the USA . American Craft Beer FestivalBoston . The American Craft Beer Festival is put on by the folks behind BeerAdvocate magazine. It's considered one of the best beer festivals in the country, and beer lovers flock from all over the world to attend this two-day festival in Boston. The festival serves more than 600 beers from 135 breweries and includes several beers that are brewed exclusively for the event: Once the beer is gone, so is the chance to ever have it again. It takes place on May 31 and June 1, and tickets are available online. Firestone Walker InvitationalPaso Robles, California . When people ask me ""what's your favorite brewery?"" my answer is inevitably either ""the one I'm drinking right now"" or ""Firestone Walker."" The California brewery has won several medals at beer competitions and has raked in numerous ""brewery of the year"" awards. But instead of resting on its laurels, it continues to champion craft beer with the Firestone Walker Invitational Beer Festival. The festival is described as ""a day where we can all put down our sales and marketing pitches and simply commune and share our beers and stories with people who are truly interested in craft beer."" The festival takes place June 1. Sadly for many, tickets sold out in a matter of hours. Mark your calendars for next year, beer lovers. Oregon Brewers FestivalPortland, Oregon . The 26th annual Oregon Brewers Festival is one of the longest-running and largest beer festivals in the country. It takes place in Portland over five days in July and draws more than 80,000 beer drinkers every year. The festival also includes live music, home brewing demonstrations and beer-related vendors. The all-ages festival is free to attend and even includes the Crater Lake Root Beer Garden, so the kiddos can get their drink on, too. For those consuming beer, this is a ""pay as you drink"" festival, and beer pours range from $1 to $4. I like this option because I rarely drink enough beer at a festival to justify the price of admission (that can hit upwards of $75). Burning CAN Beer FestLyons, Colorado . For all the canned beer lovers out there, there's the Burning CAN Beer Fest in Lyons, Colorado. This can-only beer fest is put on by the pioneers of the craft beer can movement, Oskar Blues. The festival features more than 30 breweries, a BMX dirt bike competition and live music. Oh, and it's all set against the backdrop of Rocky Mountain National Park. Go for the scenery and stay for the beer and entertainment. Tickets for the June 1 Burning CAN fest are available online. Paste UntappedDallas . Paste magazine has taken its love for indie music and craft beer and turned it into a series of festivals taking place throughout the country. Other beer festivals have live music, but let's be honest, it's usually local bands that provide background noise. Paste Untapped brings musicians and bands that are worth the price of admission alone. Add an awesome selection of craft suds, and it's easy to see why this is one of the most talked-about festivals of 2013. According to Paste, the next Paste Untapped is set for Dallas in September. Road trip, anyone? Nashville and Atlanta are slated to follow in October and November. The Festival Portland, Maine . No fancy or clever name is needed for this Portland, Maine, beer fest that's simply called The Festival. Most of the aforementioned beer festivals highlight American craft beer, and this one slightly deviates from the norm and offers mostly international beers. Presented by Shelton Brothers and 12 Percent Imports, this two-day beer festival includes limited releases like Cantillon Zwanze, an extremely rare beer out of Belgium. The Festival takes place on June 21 and 22, and tickets are still available for purchase online. Lastly, here's some tips to make sure you get the most out of your beer festival experience: . • Eat before (and during) the festival. Drinking on an empty stomach is never a good idea. • Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. A good rule of thumb is an ounce of water per ounce of beer. • Have a game plan before you attend. Or else you risk spending too much time wandering around looking for the Founders booth. • Try beers you've never had/cannot easily get. And make sure to hit those booths first before the beer runs out. • Get home safely. Many festivals offer free or discounted admission for designated drivers, and car services like Uber will sometimes offer discounts to festival attendees.

"In Memphis there's only one person called ""the king:"" the late Elvis Presley. But this weekend, the city had  two princes -- William and Harry. The grandsons of the Queen of England visited Memphis to see their friend, Guy Pelly, tie the knot with native Memphian Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Wilson, CNN affiliate WREG reported. She's the granddaughter of the man who founded the Holiday Inn chain. Her new husband is a London nightclub owner. On Saturday, royal fans lined the road leading to the the Memphis Hunt and Polo Club, where the wedding was held, to catch a glimpse of the princes. ""I'm a big Prince Harry fan!"" Darla Chapman told WREG. ""I'm single! I heard he's single!"" Alas, the princes came in through a different entrance, so Chapman and the others never got a chance to see them. But the young princes got out a good bit in Memphis. On Thursday, they dined at the Rendezvous, one of the city's best-known barbecue restaurants.  Dressed casually in jeans, they dashed inside as security held back the commoners pressing for a look. On Friday they paid a visit to Presley's home, Graceland, the Memphis version of Buckingham Palace. ""It was pretty awesome,"" local Nicholas Pegues said of the visit. ""A once in a lifetime event!""

"Four walls, a bed and a slop bowl. If prison represents physical confinement and a loss of every personal freedom, what does imprisonment of the mind feel like? ""Unbearable"" according to Marcus Urban, a German footballer who gave up his chosen profession -- his ""first love"" -- because of homophobia in the game. In a sport infamous for macho bravado on the pitch and anti-gay chants in the terraces, Urban was battling an unspeakable shame. A promising talent, Urban in his youth played alongside and against future German national team stars Robert Enke, Bernd Schneider and Thomas Linke. ""To play soccer basically means to rejoice in life,"" Urban told CNN. ""I never stopped playing football. It has always been my first love and it will remain forever."" But, as is the case with so many first loves, Urban's left him with a heartbreak which was almost too much to bear. The young midfielder, born and raised in East Germany in the 1970s and 80s in the days before reunification with West Germany in 1990, dreamed of representing his country -- but he was living an exhausting double life. On the surface he was a rising football star, but beneath he was a man coming to terms with his homosexuality. ""I hid 24 hours a day, I adjusted,"" explained Urban, who was terrified of being ""outed"" in a sport which today has just one openly gay professional player in Europe. ""It was an almost unbearable pain, a great sacrifice, a painful price to pay to achieve my goal of becoming a professional footballer. ""Constantly hearing gay used as a curse word like s**t, made me think, 'Of course, I'm s**t.' I spent 50% of my energy trying to hide, so a maximum of 50% of my energy was available for football. It wasn't fair. ""I kept thinking, 'I cannot do this anymore, I don't want to. What is going on?' Nobody was there to help me."" Urban's love affair with football began in 1978, when he joined East German club Motor Weimar at the age of seven before moving to Rot-Weiss Erfurt in 1984. He trained twice a day with his new team and looked capable of achieving his ambition of playing for the German national team, winning a youth championship with Rot-Weiss in 1985. His reputation was growing and he was called up to East Germany's youth team in 1986. Urban went on to make over 100 appearances for Rot-Weiss' senior team in the German second division. But rather than marking the start of his rise to the top of German football, Urban's spell in Erfurt proved to be the peak of a career cut short by fear, insecurity and self-loathing. ""By my early 20s I was burned out,"" he said. ""I realized that if I became a professional footballer, I would suffer as a man. I chose freedom over a constructed prison. ""Talent is not enough. You need the will, physical fitness, good luck and a tough mentality. But what if you hide 24 hours a day because you are gay? ""The fear and pain robbed me of my energy because I was constantly thinking of what to say, how to act so people might think I was heterosexual."" When it became clear he was in the twilight of his playing career, Urban finally summoned the courage to open up to one of his teammates following a switch to provincial club SC 1903 Weimar in 1991. ""I told only one player, in Weimar at the end of my career -- and precisely for this reason,"" said Urban. ""He found it interesting that I was gay, I was one of his best friends on the team."" Compared to other areas of society, the football profession is statistically lacking in openly gay players. Former United States national team player Robbie Rogers recently announced he was gay on the same day he retired from the sport, while Sweden-based Anton Hysen is currently the only openly ""out"" player in Europe. Justin Fashanu's tragic story is the last time a top-flight player has been so open. The Englishman committed suicide in 1998, aged 37 -- just eight years after announcing that he was gay. He had become the first £1 million black player when he joined Nottingham Forest in 1981. Speaking at a sports forum in Berlin last September, German chancellor Angela Merkel urged gay players to feel confident enough to ""come out."" Her comments came following an article in a German magazine in which an anonymous gay Bundesliga player said the fear of added media attention was the reason why he hadn't announced his sexuality. German second division team FC St. Pauli placed itself on the front line of football's battle with homophobia during a match with Paderborn. Fans of the club, formerly run by openly gay president Corny Littmann, staged a demonstration against discrimination which included brightly-colored posters and a banner reading, ""Football is everything -- even gay."" Basketballer Jason Collins recently made history by becoming the first openly gay NBA player, while the NHL has drawn plaudits for its anti-homophobia work. Fifteen years on from Fashanu's suicide, with other sports such as rugby and basketball setting a precedent and with the NFL reportedly closer than ever to having a homosexual player, is the beautiful game ready for a high-profile gay star? ""Why not?"" replied Urban. ""It is a great opportunity for the football world to show now that it is ready. Associations and clubs can come out as 'gay-friendly'. Then players, officials, coaches, referees and so many others will follow. ""The effects of outings gay footballers will go far beyond football."" After years of torment and secrecy, Urban's coming out proved to be a turning point. With new-found confidence, he was able to pursue a life away from the football pitch. Urban has told his story in the book ""Hidden Player: The story of a gay footballer,"" while he is also something of a life coach, consulting with organizations -- including football associations -- on issues of diversity and integration. ""I was so glad to finally be myself and I finally knew what the years of torment had been about,"" he explained. ""With the energy and force of liberation I went on the front foot, on the offensive. ""I work as a personal coach and diversity consultant. I work for organizations and I help them to appreciate the dimensions of age, ethnicity, gender, religion and even sexual orientations."" With a wealth of personal and professional expertise on the subject of ""coming out,"" Urban is in a unique position to offer advice to any player in a similar situation to the one he found himself in two decades ago. According to Urban, former Wales international rugby player Gareth Thomas -- who told the world he was gay in 2009 -- has set out the perfect blueprint for others to follow. ""He proceeded in stages,"" Urban said of Thomas. ""First he outed himself to his wife. Then he told his coach and then two players. After each step he received positive feedback. ""He was told by everyone that he was still the same person. This enabled him to increase his self-esteem until it was big enough to go public. He then got exceptionally positive feedback."" An openly gay football star would be a turning point not just for the sport, declares Urban, but also for society as a whole. Football, he suggests, stretches into areas where attitudes towards homosexuality have so far proved difficult to change. ""Football is the only way to tackle this topic comprehensively,"" he said. ""Very many people are geared towards football role models on television. ""If world soccer stars accepted their homosexuality, young people would question having to be so rough and macho. ""The result would be a social change that goes far beyond football."" Urban is now comfortable with his sexuality, but he is not impervious to the homophobic barbs he often overhears in general conversation. ""'F****, f****t', any negative way of calling someone gay,"" replies Urban when asked which insults he hears. ""I was constantly affected by insults. Although it is not said to me directly it concerns me, even today."" ""But today, with more self-esteem and confidence, I look at homophobia from the perspective of a personal coaches and diversity consultant. Sometimes I have to laugh about it too, because it's stupid and ridiculous."" Self-esteem and confidence have helped Urban to heal the wounds inflicted by his first love, football. He is once more besotted with the sport, playing with and against gay-friendly teams from across the globe. It might not be playing at a World Cup with the German national team, but Urban is now back on the pitch, this time with his head held high. ""I really wanted to play for the men's national team,"" reflected Urban. ""It makes me happy to have made something out of my experiences. ""For years I could never play football in the stadium. I saw the grass and could not stand being a spectator rather than being down playing on the pitch. I had regrets, I was sad and angry. ""After I came out I was so much more confident. I played football at university, in a team consisting predominantly of gay footballers against other gay teams from Paris, London or New York and Washington. ""Today, I play at a club in Hamburg, accepted by everyone and my teammates are proud of me, I think. It is a great experience to play football and to feel free, pure happiness. ""There are certainly more boring lives than mine.""","Marcus Urban was an East German footballer who retired to live as openly gay .

"Carolyn Capern and her business partner Greg Trujillo were eating breakfast in a Panera bakery in Florida recently, each wearing Google Glasses but actually immersed in their smartphones when they were accosted by an angry stranger. Though they'd only had the beta devices for about a month, they'd become accustomed to curious people approaching them like they were minor celebrities, peppering them with questions about the still-rare technology, asking to try it on and even getting their pictures taken wearing it. But the man in the bakery didn't want a demonstration. He was interested in confrontation. He asked if they would be comfortable with him recording a video of the pair on his phone, violating their privacy and rights in the same way he felt they were violating his by wearing recording devices on their faces in public. ""He said we were being very intrusive and invading his sense of privacy and was altogether quite upset that we were there wearing Google Glass,"" Capern said. A different kind of backlash . Negative reactions to Google Glass have been making headlines lately. Earlier this year, Seattle entrepreneur Dave Meinert preemptively banned people from wearing Glass at his 5 Point Café before the technology was even released. Recently he made headlines again after a manager at another one of his restaurants, Lost Lake Cafe & Lounge, asked customer Nick Starr to leave for refusing to remove his Google Glass while inside. The burgeoning dissent is sometimes not pretty. Early adopters have been handed a less-than-flattering nickname in some circles: ""Glassholes."" A group calling itself Stop The Cyborgs offers free anti-glass icons and art on its site for businesses that want to notify customers the technology is not allowed. State and federal lawmakers have expressed privacy concerns about the technology and are, if you will, keeping an eye on it. Even though Glass wearers claim these types of responses from businesses and individuals are not the norm, there is something different about the negative early reactions to Google Glass than what has greeted the smartphone and other new technologies in the past. While there may be some old fashioned technophobia at play, many of the criticisms come from members of a tech-savvy generation that embraces smartphones and tablets. Lost Lake Cafe even encourages patrons to post photos taken at the business to Instagram and tag them #LostLake, according to The Stranger. So what is it about Google Glass that elicits such different reactions? ""People make a personal decision to check their smartphone or log in and check their social media accounts, but Google Glass is out of their control,"" said Larry Rosen, a psychologist who focuses on technology. ""They are not able to make a decision as to whether they want to be 'on' or 'connected' through someone else's process, and they are concerned and unhappy that they do not have a say in the matter."" People feel in control when using their own technology but, fairly or not, Google Glass seems to them more like invasive surveillance. ""For the most part they have given up privacy gladly to be connected through all possible modalities. However, that is when the choice is their choice. This is not,"" Rosen said. ""This is someone else essentially eavesdropping on their lives, and if they want to give up their own privacy, they seem to want to do it on their terms and their timeline, not someone else's."" Easing fears with education . The technological differences between smartphones and Google Glass are minimal. Both have cameras that can record videos and audio and take photographs. Both can instantly upload recorded information to social media sites and other locations including Google services. One of the primary concerns people have about Glass is that it is difficult to tell when the device is recording you. With a phone, a stranger would have to physically hold up the device and point the camera in the subject's direction, a visible cue that they are recording. Wearable cameras like Glass are always pointed and ready to go. Because there are still so few Google Glass units in the wild, many people don't fully grasp the device's limitations, according to Trujillo. Some have the misconception that Google Glass is constantly recording video, but leaving Glass in record mode would kill the battery in about an hour. There is no external indicator light to show when Google Glass is in recording mode, but the screen is actually a transparent cube of glass, and people who are in close proximity can see a light when the system is on. ""It's very easy to identify whether the screen is on or off if you know what to look for,"" Capern said. (Both her and Trujillo's devices were turned off during the bakery incident, they say.) Like picking up a phone and pointing, there are physical indicators that might give away the fact that someone is recording. To take a photo or start recording a video with Glass, the wearer has to speak to or touch the device. Trujillo and Capern think it's actually easier to secretly record someone with a smartphone because they are far more ubiquitous and someone can just pretend they're holding it up to read a Web page, check Facebook or send a text. ""The phone, in my opinion, is a lot more of an invasion-of-privacy device than Google Glass because you can actually tell when somebody tries to use Google Glass,"" Capern said. Navigating the future . Stop The Cyborgs is also concerned with the collection of big data through tools like Google Glass. Massive amounts of data can be automatically uploaded from wearable tech and phones to Google services, social media or other cloud-based storage. Google+ currently has facial recognition technology but has not yet tied it into Google Glass. ""The issue ... is not the device itself but rather ownership and control over the data, and power relations and social norms around surveillance and control,"" the organization says on its About page. Legally, Glass users have the same rights as photographers when it comes to recording and photographing in public. You can photograph anything in plain view, including strangers, while in public places. Because video recordings include audio, the ACLU points out that state wiretapping laws might make some video recordings illegal. When it comes to private property, the property owner has the right to prohibit photography in their home or business, typically by posting rules or asking people taking pictures to leave the premises. Trujillo thinks the restaurants instituting bans are just looking for free press coverage, but there are many bans on Glass based on practical concerns. A woman who was pulled over for speeding in San Diego was also ticketed for wearing Google Glass while driving, the device classified as a distraction much like a smartphone or other monitor. Illinois is considering explicitly banning Glass behind the wheel. Many casinos have banned wearable computer screens which they fear could be used to cheat or count cards, and some theaters worried about piracy have added Google Glass to the list of recording devices prohibited for audience members. Wearable technology like Google Glass is still in its early stages. The companies producing the gadgets hope they'll be seen as normal and become accepted in the same way smartphones are.  Until then, early adopters like Google Glass Explorers will have to handle the attention, both positive and negative.","Google Glass users have faced some negative reactions from businesses and strangers .

"New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton said Tuesday he is disappointed in himself and feels regret over a scandal that has left him suspended for the entire 2012 season. ""As the head coach, anything that happens within the framework of your team and your program you're responsible for.  And that's a lesson I've learned,"" Payton said in his first public comments since the NFL announced he will be suspended without pay.  ""And it's one that It's easy to get carried away in regards to a certain side of the ball, or more involved offensively or defensively, and that's something I regret."" An NFL investigation found the team had an ""active bounty program"" during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons in which ""bounty"" payments were given to players for hits that hurt opposing players and knocked them out of the game. The NFL found evidence that bounties were put out on quarterbacks Brett Favre of the Minnesota Vikings, Cam Newton of the Carolina Panthers, Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers, and Kurt Warner of the Arizona Cardinals. It also found that Payton lied about the bounty program. In his remarks Tuesday, Payton did not admit any such wrongdoing. The probe found that the Saints showed ""a deliberate effort to conceal the program's existence from league investigators, and a clear determination to maintain the program despite express direction from Saints ownership that it stop as well as ongoing inquiries from the league office,"" the NFL said. Former Saints defensive coach Gregg Williams was suspended indefinitely.  General manager Mickey Loomis was suspended without pay for the first eight regular-season games of the 2012 season. Assistant head coach Joe Vitt was suspended without pay for the first six regular-season games. The team was also fined $500,000 and will forfeit its second-round draft picks in 2012 and 2013, the National Football League has said. More suspensions could be coming, the NFL said. Payton told reporters he was going through a ""range of emotions."" ""You're disappointed, you're disappointed in yourself that it got to this point,"" he said. Asked whether anyone on another team was injured as a result of the bounty program, Payton said no. With five days left to appeal his suspension, Payton said he will make a decision in the next two to three days. Speculation is swirling around whether he will ask coach Bill Parcells to return to the NFL to take over for him for the year. Payton wrote off the speculation, saying he will visit Parcells on Tuesday or Wednesday, but that he is a ""mentor"" and the two speak regularly.  ""I think we're a little ahead of ourselves with regards to that,"" he said of the speculation. Meanwhile, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Monday he's focusing on punishments for players. ""Before I make any decisions, I would like to hear from the players,"" Goodell said Monday at the football league's annual meeting in Florida. Goodell would not give a timetable of when the punishments would come, saying he wanted to talk to the NFL Players Association first. The Saints won the Super Bowl in 2010, in the midst of the bounty program. Payton said he is concerned the scandal may ""tarnish the success we've had."" Goodell has said the ""pay-for-performance"" program ""undermined the integrity of the game."" A statement last week from the NFL on the website NFL.com added that the violations ""were compounded by the failure of Coach Payton to supervise the players and coaches and his affirmative decision starting in 2010 (a) not to inquire into the facts concerning the pay-for-performance/bounty program even though he was aware of the league's inquiries both in 2010 and 2012; (b) to falsely deny that the program existed; (c) to encourage the false denials by instructing assistants to 'make sure our ducks are in a row;' and (d) to ignore instructions from the league office and club ownership to ensure that no such program existed."" ""When interviewed in 2012, Sean Payton claimed to be entirely unaware of the program, a claim contradicted by others,"" the statement said.  ""Further, prior to the Saints' opening game in 2011, Coach Payton received an email from a close associate that stated in part, 'PS Greg Williams put me down for $5000 on Rogers (sic).' When shown the email during the course of the investigation, Coach Payton stated that it referred to a 'bounty' on Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers.""","Sean Payton says as head coach, he's responsible for ""anything that happens"" on team .

"It's been more than a century since Istanbul's residents were kept awake at night by the howling of tens of thousands of stray dogs. The dogs were rounded up and shipped to a deserted island in the Marmara Sea where they starved to death -- all part of a government-led effort to modernize Istanbul. But the stories surrounding the so-called ""Great Dog Massacre of 1910"" are still fresh in the minds of Turkey's animal rights activists. Today, these activists are staging massive protests against a proposal to create ""natural habitat parks"" for stray cats and dogs in Turkey's urban areas. These parks, they say, would really be concentration camps for stray animals. ""It's a law that might be killing hundreds of thousands of dogs and cats and little animals,"" said Michael Halfie, a television personality who joined thousands of demonstrators, many of whom marched with their pet dogs, through downtown Istanbul late last month. ""We are now the voice of these voiceless, wonderful animals."" Supporters of the bill insist that the proposed law would protect these animals, who are left to fend for themselves on the city streets. ""The purpose of the law is to ensure a comfortable life for animals and that they be treated well,"" according to the government ministry that wrote Draft Law 5199.  The ministry also said the law would ""ensure that they are protected as best as possible from bad treatment, pain and suffering."" In recent weeks, animal rights activists have staged colorful, furious protests in Istanbul and more than a dozen other cities and towns across Turkey, criticizing the proposed legislation in the starkest terms before it was even submitted to a parliamentary vote. ""I am here only because I love animals. They are not animals for me, they are like my children,"" said Romali Perihan. Perihan, an actress and singer from Turkish films of the 1970s and '80s who sported brightly dyed pink hair, strained to be heard over the roar of a crowd of protesters in Istanbul. ""I'm a soprano, I need my voice. But for animals I lost my voice!"" she yelled. The ""natural habitat parks"" outlined in the proposed legislation would be temporary homes for strays when there isn't enough room in animal shelters, until they are adopted, according to the Turkish Forestry and Water Works Ministry. ""They will be looked after, fed and sheltered,"" explained the ministry in an e-mail to CNN. The parks would be built on the outskirts of cities, and would be equipped with facilities for visiting school groups, as well as veterinary departments, according to the ministry's blueprints. But some animal rights activists fear the natural habitat parks will become dumping grounds for stray animals, a charge the Forestry Ministry bluntly denies. ""As a lawyer, when I read the article, it says un-owned animals will be collected. Which means to me any kind of animals you see around, even the ones I own -- if they run away into the street, it's a potential animal to be collected,"" said Deniz Taysanl Kalafatoglu, vice president of the Istanbul Bar Association's Animal Rights Commission. Animals are furry fixtures on the street corners of nearly every Turkish neighborhood. In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, it's not unusual to see cafes and bars adopting strays as pets -- cats even take seats at bars to lap up saucers of milk, next to patrons sipping more fermented substances. The practice of feeding and caring for neighborhood strays extends to butcher shops and even street vendors. In Istanbul's throbbing Taksim Square, Husnu Atac sells the Turkish bagel known as ""simit"" from his car. Next to him, a white dog basks in the autumn sun. ""I love him by my side,"" said Atac, who named the dog Reis, which means chief in Turkish. Atac noted that in recent weeks, municipal workers had collected at least five other stray dogs that he used to feed regularly. ""If the state can't guarantee that they will take care of the animals,"" Atac said, ""then we are willing to take care of them."" Turkey's government insists there will be no round-up of strays. ""Cats and dogs being rounded up, not the case,"" the Turkish Forestry Ministry wrote in a blunt, one-line response to an e-mail question from CNN asking whether it should be acceptable to have dogs and cats living in Turkish streets. Critics have also latched on to another vaguely worded clause of the proposed law that would limit the number of animals in a single household. Some pet owners expressed fear the law would force them to give up their beloved animals. When asked about the proposed limits to pet ownership, the Forestry Ministry responded, ""The number and type of domesticated or accessory animals will be determined by taking into consideration the ecological needs of the animals, the conditions of the space, and human health."" One thing that both sides seem to agree on is the proposed criminalization of abuse of animals. ""Under the current (animal rights) law, the torture and sexual exploitation of animals only receives an administrative fine,"" the Forestry Ministry wrote. ""The draft law proposes a criminal punishment of up to 2 years of torture which can lead to death, and up to 1 year for sexual exploitation."" Fukushima's animals abandoned and left to die .

"Staring out of the glass viewports, three people sit silently in the metal sphere as it continues its descent hundreds of meters below the ocean's surface.

""I would suspect that on every dive we've ever been on, we've probably run across something no one's ever seen,"" says Alvin expedition leader Bruce Strickrott. ""Not only is [Alvin] valuable, it's a heck of an experience. There isn't a person who dives in the submarine who won't remember it for the rest of the lives."" He adds that Alvin played a crucial part in demonstrating that hydrothermal vents in the ocean are capable of sustaining living organisms. ""From a scientific standpoint, Alvin was instrumental in bringing people to the hydrothermal sites and finding life, particularly down by the Galapagos in the '70s,"" he says. ""From the late '60s and on into the '70s, Alvin was starting to ramp up as a tool and when they took people down to the vents and they were able to see life down there, I think that's when its value really took off.""

Today, it is equipped with state-of-the-art tech including robotic arms and still and video cameras, and several reconstructions over the decades mean the sub can safely bring scientists down 4,500 meters below the surface.

Alvin spent three months searching for the bomb on the sea floor before locating it and enabling it to be recovered by a remote controlled submersible. Alvin also made an exploratory survey of RMS Titanic in 1986 and investigated the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill and associated environmental implications. It may be half a century old, but Strickrott believes it could go on exploring the oceans for another 50 years. ""Next year it will head around South America, coming up to Barbados and head out to the Mid-Atlantic."" He adds: ""If you look at all the dives ever, you've barely scratched the possibilities.

If Iran can beat Bosnia by more than one goal, and Nigeria loses to Argentina, Iran goes through to the knockout stage as the second-ranking team in Group F. The Middle Easterners have a good record against Bosnia. They've won four, tied one, and never lost. They've also put on an impressive display in Brazil this year. They haven't managed to win a match yet, but they held Nigeria to a 0-0 draw and kept Argentina from scoring for 90 minutes. Only a magically curving goal from Lionel Messi in injury time denied the Iranians a draw for the history books. b) Argentina vs. Nigeria . Sitting at the top of the group, Argentina is guaranteed a place in the round of 16, while Nigeria will be battling to hang onto second place. If the Africans win, they go top of the group. If they pull off a draw, they get a point and hang onto second place. If they lose, they have to hope it's close, and that Iran doesn't score a big win over Bosnia. 2. GROUP E MATCHUPS . Free for all: . a) Honduras vs. Switzerland . Honduras is out of the running, but any of the other teams in Group E could go through to the knockout stage, or, theoretically, be knocked out. Switzerlandwill be aiming for a big win to steal that second-place spot for themselves. The two sides played to a draw the only previous match they played against each other. b) France vs. Ecuador . France is the safest, with six points and a six-point goal difference. So it would take a tremendous victory by Ecuador to knock the French out of the top spot. But the South Americans will be fighting hard, because they are struggling to hang onto their second place spot in the group. France beat Ecuador the only previous time they faced each other. 3. LUIS SUAREZ . The fangs come out: . Uruguay's Luis Suarez is without doubt one of the best football players in the world. He's also the most controversial. Twice banned from games for biting opponents in the Netherlands and England, no one thought he would be dumb enough to bite someone on the biggest football stage of all. But he might have done just that in Uruguay's decisive match against Italy. He definitely went face-first into Giorgio Chiellini, and the Italian defender quickly pulled his shirt off his shoulder, claiming he'd been bitten. Suarez said after the match that he ""just collided with his shoulder."" World soccer's governing body FIFA is looking into the incident and could ban Suarez for up to two years. The internet went nuts over the incident, with people comparing Suarez to Jaws and Dracula -- and worse. 4. COLOMBIA . Group of Death -- but whose? With three former World Cup champions, Group D was always sure to be the Group of Death, but the victims were hardly the ones anyone expected. Costa Rica was the only team in the group that has never won the tournament, but far from being sacrificial lambs, they turned out to be giant-killers, beating Italy and Uruguay. Tuesday they finished their unbeaten run by holding hapless England to a 0-0 draw. And that was the end of England's World Cup run. 5. USA v GERMANY . Bring it: . Team USA is looking ahead to a make-or-break duel against Germany on Thursday, hoping to go through to the knockout stage with a win or a draw. If they lose, Ghana (or, less likely, Portugal) could sneak into second place in Group G. The trash talk has already begun at the very highest levels: U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power is ready to put a bet down on the game with her German counterpart. At stake - beer! .","The sport's most controversial player is in trouble again .

"The White House accidentally revealed the name of the CIA's top intelligence official in Afghanistan to some 6,000 journalists. The person was included on a list of people attending a military briefing for President Barack Obama during his surprise visit to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan on Sunday. It's common for such lists to be given to the media, but names of intelligence officials are rarely provided. In this case, the individual's name was listed next to the title, ""Chief of Station."" The print pool reporter -- a journalist allowed access to or is given information about an event who relays it to the rest of the media -- copied and pasted the list that was provided by the White House. Print pool reports are then distributed by the White House press office, which does not edit them, to a large list of media. In this case, the same reporter, Scott Wilson, the White House bureau chief for the Washington Post, noticed the unusual entry after the list was distributed and then checked it out with officials. The White House followed up and distributed a shorter list from a different reporter that did not include the station chief's name. In his account to CNN, Wilson said when they arrived in Afghanistan, he asked White House officials for a list of who would be briefing the President. A White House official then asked the military for a list to provide to the pool of journalists. The official got an e-mail back from the military with a subject line, ""manifest for briefing for Pool,"" Wilson told CNN. That e-mail was forwarded to Wilson and he proceeded to copy and paste that list for the pool report. He then sent it to the White House official, who sent the report to the distribution list. After the initial report had been issued, Wilson noticed that the chief of station had been identified in the list, which he flagged to the White House official. After checking with the military, the White House official said, ""This is a problem."" The official asked if Wilson would write another pool report, asking journalists to disregard the previous report that contained the list with the chief of station's name. Wilson said he was open to the request and sent the White House a new report. He said he was unsure whether that report was distributed. The new list, Wilson said, was distributed by a separate pool report that included details from Obama's speech to the troops. That report included a shorter list of names with a note saying, ""this is the correct list of participants."" Privately administration officials are alarmed about the incident, but so far the White House and CIA officials have declined to comment publicly. A station chief heads the CIA's office in a foreign country, establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities. The identity of station chiefs, like most CIA officers, are rarely disclosed to protect them and their ability to operate secretly. Given the potentially dangerous nature of the situation, CNN has not broadcast or published online the name of the official. In the most recent case before this one, the Bush administration infamously leaked the name of former CIA officer Valerie Plame to a journalist in 2003. Plame tweeted on Monday that the White House's mistake this past weekend is ""astonishing."" Top U.S. spy pulled from Pakistan after terror threats .","Valerie Plame tweets that this weekend's misstep was ""astonishing""

"In what might be a first, a woman in California received a traffic ticket for wearing Google Glass while driving. Cecilia Abadie was pulled over for speeding on Tuesday in San Diego and given an additional citation for driving while wearing her Google Glass. The officer considered the head-mounted display a monitor that was visible to the driver. Shocked, Abadie posted a copy of the ticket on Google+. Traffic laws vary state by state, but many now have broad distracted-driving laws or bans on certain monitors that could easily apply to Google Glass. The California law cited in Abadie's case is meant to prevent people from watching television while driving. V C 27602 prohibits televisions and similar monitors from being turned on and facing the driver. There are exceptions for GPS and mapping tools and screens that display camera feeds to help the driver navigate. If a device has a safety feature that limits its display to approved uses while driving, it can be allowed. ""I think the law is broad enough to say it violates the law,"" said San Diego attorney Mitchell Mehdy, also known as ""Mr. Ticket."" Mehdy has been working in traffic law for 25 years and said this is the first case he's heard of involving Google Glass. Abadie says her Google Glass was not turned on when she was pulled over, and that the officer said the screen was blocking her view. The Google Glass display is located slightly above the right eye, not directly in front of the eye. Google does warn users about running afoul of traffic laws in its Google Glass FAQ: ""Most states have passed laws limiting the use of mobile devices while driving any motor vehicle, and most states post those rules on their department of motor vehicles websites. Read up and follow the law!"" However, in another section on navigation, it says Glass can give turn-by-turn directions, ""whether you're on a bike, in a car, taking the subway, or going by foot."" Glass fans defended the technology in comments on Abadie's post, saying that a voice-activated screen close to the eye could actually be safer than trying to check a smartphone or other monitor while driving. ""Glass is far safer than any other means of information delivery. It is out of your view and not distracting,"" said Aaron Kasten, who compared it to checking speed and other information on a car's dashboard, which requires taking your eyes off of the road. The turn-by-turn directions on Glass can be turned on with a voice command. The display will show a map view, but for extra safety the screen can be turned off while driving so there's only voice navigation. A Google Glass spokesperson didn't address the ticket directly but emphasized responsible Google Glass usage, saying, ""As we make clear in our help center, Explorers should always use Glass responsibly and put their safety and the safety of others first. More broadly, Glass is built to connect you more with the world around you, not distract you from it."" Abadie could take the case to court and try to get the Google Glass portion of the ticket dismissed. ""How can this officer prove that this display was being activated or was actually on at the time and what kind of signal she's getting?"" said Mehdy. State laws are always adapting to new technology, and Google Glass is still a somewhat rare sighting. The device is only available as part of a beta program and is not yet sold commercially. According to Mehdy, new technology is a tempting target for law enforcement looking for new ways to bring in money. ""There's a wealth of revenue to be generated from technology. The traffic law enforcement is coming and saying wow, we've got this new incredible device and we want our piece too,"" said Mehdy. With a mandatory minimum fine in California is $162, this is just the beginning of more tickets for Google Glass wearers according to Mehdy. Law enforcement is increasingly enforcing distracted driving laws. During the month of April, there were more that 57,000 distracted driving tickets issued in California as part of Distracted Driving Awareness Month, according to the California Office of Traffic Safety.","A woman in San Diego was issued a ticket for driving while wearing Google Glass .

"""Trust needs to be rebuilt."" That's what German Chancellor Angela Merkel firmly asserted early Friday -- as she had the previous day -- in the wake of reports the U.S. National Security Agency had eavesdropped on her cell phone. This claim and others that she and other world leaders have been spied on had ""severely shaken"" relationships between Europe and the United States, the German leader said. ""Obviously, words will not be sufficient,"" Merkel said in the wee hours Friday at a summit of European Union leaders. ""True change is necessary."" Talk of the NSA's reported spying on Germany and other allies dominated Merkel's news conference in Brussels, Belgium. It illustrated the anger over this story in Europe and the challenges facing Washington because of it. The Chancellor insisted she isn't the only one concerned; other European leaders, she said, voiced similar sentiments during the first day of the summit Thursday. Her comments echoed some she'd made upon arriving Thursday in Belgium, when she said that discussions of ""what sort of data protection do we need and what transparency is there"" should now be on European leaders' agenda. ""We need trust,..."" she said. ""Spying among friends is never acceptable."" Germany: U.S. might have monitored Merkel's phone . U.S. President Barack Obama understands it's a ""necessity"" for change from his nation's perspective, according to Merkel, who spoke with the American leader on Wednesday after Germany's government said it had information the United States might have monitored her phone. She told Obama that eavesdropping among friends is ""never acceptable, no matter in what situation,"" she said. On Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney repeated what he said Wednesday -- that Obama assured Merkel that the United States is not monitoring and will not monitor her communications. And in a USA Today op-ed published online Thursday night, Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco conceded that recent ""disclosures have created significant challenges in our relationships."" To address them, the President has ordered a ""review (of) our surveillance capabilities, including with our foreign partners,"" she wrote. ""We want to ensure we are collecting information because we need it and not because we can,"" said Monaco. The German allegation comes in the same week that French daily newspaper Le Monde reported claims the NSA intercepted more than 70 million phone calls in France over 30 days. And The Guardian newspaper -- citing a document obtained from U.S. government contractor-turned-whistleblower Edward Snowden -- reported Thursday that the NSA monitored phone conversations of 35 world leaders. The confidential memo is from 2006, which is before Obama became president. None of the monitored world leaders is identified. The phone numbers were among 200 handed over to the NSA by a U.S. official, the memo states. Others were encouraged to share their ""rolodexes"" with the agency, according to the document, even though tracking until then had yielded ""little reportable intelligence."" Like Carney, NSA spokeswoman Caitlin Haden refused ""to comment publicly on every specific intelligence activity."" ""As we have made clear,"" she added, ""... the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations."" European leaders push for data protection . It's not clear how well such explanations will be received by Washington's allies in Europe elsewhere, or how significantly it has and will continue to affect the European Council meeting. The two-day summit was supposed to focus on the digital economy and economic and social policy issues, as well as concerns about EU migration after a recent shipwreck off an Italian island in which hundreds of migrants from Africa died. But French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told the French National Assembly on Tuesday that France would ask for the question of electronic surveillance to be added to the agenda. The EU leaders were expected to discuss data protection issues as part of their debate on the digital economy. Viviane Reding, vice president of the European Commission, called for EU nations to commit to adopting a data protection law in light of the recent spying scandals. ""Data protection must apply to everyone -- whether we are talking about citizens' e-mails or Angela Merkel's mobile phone,"" she said. ""We now need big European rules to counter big fears of surveillance. ""At the summit today, Europe's heads of state and government must follow words with action: They should commit to adopting the EU Data Protection Reform by spring 2014. This would be Europe's declaration of independence. Only then can Europe credibly face the United States."" 'Completely unacceptable' Even before the latest allegations, Germany and other nations had expressed concerns about alleged U.S. spying after Snowden -- a former National Security Agency contractor -- leaked classified information about American surveillance programs. Spy chief: reports of NSA logging French phone calls are false . German news magazine Der Spiegel reported in June that leaks from Snowden detailed how the agency bugged EU offices in Washington and New York, and conducted an ""electronic eavesdropping operation"" that tapped into an EU building in Brussels. Merkel spoke with Obama by phone in July about allegations that the United States was conducting surveillance on its European allies. Merkel made it clear that if the information about the U.S. having monitored her phone were true, it would be ""completely unacceptable,"" spokesman Steffen Seibert said of Wednesday's call with Obama. A spokesman for David Cameron declined to answer questions Thursday about whether the British Prime Minister's phone had been tapped by the United States, following Germany's suspicion about U.S. monitoring of Merkel's cell phone. ""I am not going to comment on matters of security or intelligence,"" the spokesman told reporters at a regular briefing. Ayrault: 'Shocking' claims . Ayrault described the report of widespread spying by the NSA on French calls as ""worrying"" and ""shocking,"" saying that security should not be guaranteed at the price of a loss of freedom. Report: U.S. intercepts French phone calls on a 'massive scale' However, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper suggested that the claims made by Le Monde were false. The articles ""contain inaccurate and misleading information regarding U.S. foreign intelligence activities,"" a written statement from his office said Tuesday. It added that the United States does gather intelligence of ""the type gathered by all nations."" Nonetheless, the allegations prompted a flurry of diplomatic activity this week between the United States and France. Obama and French President Francois Hollande spoke about the claims Monday. ""The President and President Hollande discussed recent disclosures in the press -- some of which have distorted our activities and some of which raise legitimate questions for our friends and allies about how these capabilities are employed,"" a White House statement said. ""The President made clear that the United States has begun to review the way that we gather intelligence, so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share."" Hollande's office said the President expressed his ""deep disapproval with regard to these practices"" to Obama and that such alleged activities would be unacceptable between allies and friends. The two Presidents agreed that French and American intelligence services would cooperate on investigating the report, according to the statement from the French President's office. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also met Tuesday to discuss the claims. The U.S. ambassador to France, Charles Rivkin, was summoned to the French Foreign Ministry in Paris on Monday to discuss the alleged spying. Claims of U.S. spying, resulting from leaks by Snowden, have also soured U.S. relations with Mexico and Brazil. Der Spiegel recently published allegations, citing Snowden as its source, that the U.S. National Security Agency ""systematically"" eavesdropped on the Mexican government and hacked the public e-mail account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon.

"It's an Internet feud between polar opposites: East Coast vs. West Coast, old school vs. new media, Ivy League gravitas vs. Silicon Valley geekery. In one corner is Princeton University. In the other, Facebook. At stake is the credibility of Princeton's research and -- gasp! -- the future viability of Mark Zuckerberg's network. Or, at least, the hearts and minds of the thousands of observers taking sides on social media. It all started last week when a group of Princeton researchers published a paper that suggested Facebook could lose a whopping 80% of its users by 2017. They based their projection on epidemiological models, typically used to chart the spread of disease, using the demise of Myspace as a case study. Data ""suggests that Facebook has already reached the peak of its popularity and has entered a decline phase,"" the researchers wrote in the paper, which has not been peer-reviewed. Recent research has suggested, and Facebook has admitted, that younger users are abandoning Facebook for other social platforms. Even so, many observers were skeptical of Princeton's methodology. ""It's an old journalistic trick: Just add the words 'research' or 'study' to a sensational claim for instant credibility,"" wrote Slate's Will Oremus, who criticized news outlets for reporting uncritically on the paper. ""Best of all, you're absolved of any responsibility for verifying its truth, since everyone knows journalists aren't qualified to dispute scientific findings."" On Thursday, Facebook fired back. But instead of a canned statement or a point-by-point renunciation of the researchers' methods, they took a more playful tack. ""Using the same robust methodology featured in the paper, we attempted to find out more about this 'Princeton University' -- and you won't believe what we found!"" Facebook data scientist Mike Develin wrote in a blog post on his page. An examination of Facebook and Google patterns spells bad news ahead for the university, Develin said, tongue firmly planted in a sarcastic cheek. ""This trend suggests that Princeton will have only half its current enrollment by 2018, and by 2021 it will have no students at all, agreeing with the previous graph of scholarly scholarliness. Based on our robust scientific analysis, future generations will only be able to imagine this now-rubble institution that once walked this earth,"" he added. ""Although this research has not yet been peer-reviewed, every Like for this post counts as a peer review. Start reviewing!"" By Friday afternoon his post had attracted more than 8,100 likes and comments such as ""well played!"" ""You come at the king of social media, you best not miss,"" wrote Chris Taylor on Mashable. CNET called it ""the comeback of all comebacks."" The smackdown also spilled over to Twitter, where the Huffington Post called it a ""nerd brawl"" and most observers gave credit to Facebook for having a sense of humor. A Princeton University spokesman did not immediately respond Friday to CNN's request for comment. In reality, neither institution is in danger of wasting away any time soon. Princeton received 24,498 applicants for its current freshman class and accepted only 7.4% of them, reaffirming its status as one of the nation's elite universities. And as of September 2013 Facebook had 1.2 billion monthly active users.","Facebook pokes fun at Princeton University over controversial social media study .

"Negotiators from Colombia's government and largest insurgent group concluded their first round of talks Thursday and voiced cautious optimism that they will eventually forge a peace deal. For 11 days, Colombian government representatives met with high-ranking members of the FARC guerrilla army, which for more than 50 years has tried to lead an armed revolution in the Andean nation. The meetings, which are being held in Cuba, are scheduled to resume next week. ""Building peace is collective work,"" said lead government peace negotiator Humberto de la Calle. ""With the participation of everyone and without guns. The discussion shouldn't just be between the government and the FARC, but all of Colombian society."" Negotiators announced forums next month in Colombia where citizens will have the opportunity to offer their own suggestions for how land reform should be carried out as part of the peace plan. Providing land to Colombia's poor is one of five topics the negotiators are expected to spend months debating, as well as ending FARC's lucrative role in the drug and kidnapping trades. One difficult hurdle may be whether FARC leaders are required to serve prison sentences as some Colombian officials insist they should. Several FARC leaders face lengthy prison sentences in Colombia and the United States, a major backer of Colombia's military and war against the guerrillas. High-ranking FARC member Simon Trinidad, the alias for Ricardo Palmera, is already serving a 60-year sentence in the United States. FARC negotiators named Palmera to their peace talks team and carried a life-sized cut-out of Palmera into a news conference on Thursday. ""We hope Simon Trinidad will be at the negotiating table,"" said FARC lead negotiator Ivan Marquez. ""It would be a gesture of peace for Colombia. It can't all be about waging war."" Despite tough talk on both sides, negotiators said Thursday that the talks had at least started well. ""Very serious, profound things have been discussed,"" said Rodrigo Granda, a negotiator for the FARC. ""This is just the beginning."" At least some of animosity between the negotiators had dissipated, said FARC spokeswoman Tanja Nijmeijer, a Dutch guerrilla who joined the FARC after traveling to Colombia to teach English there. ""During the talks it's very good,"" Nijmeijer said in English, ""There is even space for little jokes, for laughing. It's a really good atmosphere."" Earlier this month, FARC announced it would temporarily halt its battle against government forces as a goodwill gesture. There have been sporadic attempts at peace since the 1980s. The last fell apart in 2002. Then-President Andres Pastrana ceded an area the size of Switzerland to FARC, but ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country in an apparent bid to strengthen their position.","Talks are expected to resume next week .

"Three Americans detained in North Korea spoke out about their conditions and pleaded for U.S. help in interviews with CNN. Kenneth Bae, Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Edward Fowle were presented to CNN's Will Ripley at a Pyongyang hotel Monday. Each was given five minutes for an interview. All three men said they hope the U.S. government will send an envoy to North Korea to help get them out of their situations, similar to how former President Bill Clinton helped secure the release of two journalists in 2009. Bae, who is serving a 15-year prison sentence for ""hostile acts to bring down its government,"" said he is working eight hours a day, six days a week at a labor camp. North Korea claimed Bae was part of a Christian plot to overthrow the regime. ""Right now what I can say to my friends and family is, continue to pray for me,"" he said. Despite what he called ""hard labor,"" Bae said he has been treated ""as humanely as possible."" Miller, who is accused of tearing up his tourist visa and seeking asylum upon entry, implored the U.S. government for help during his interview. He said he wanted to tell the United States that ""my situation is very urgent, that very soon I am going to trial, and I would directly be sent to prison."" He said he will not learn of his charges until he goes to trial. Fowle, an American tourist accused of leaving a Bible in a hotel where he was staying, said he has ""no complaints"" about his treatment. ""It's been very good so far, and I hope and pray that it continues, while I'm here two more days or two more decades,"" he said. All three men said they have signed statements admitting their guilt. North Korean officials monitored and recorded all three interviews, and CNN was unable to assess independently the conditions under which the men were being held. U.S. National Security Council spokesman Patrick Ventrell said Monday that securing the Americans' release ""is a top priority and we have followed these cases closely in the White House. We continue to do all we can to secure their earliest possible release."" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, ""There is no greater priority for us than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad. ""Out of humanitarian concern for Jeffrey Fowle, Matthew Miller, and their families, we request the DPRK release them so they may return home,"" Psaki said, using the initials for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ""We also request the DPRK pardon Kenneth Bae and grant him special amnesty and immediate release so he may reunite with his family and seek medical care. We continue to work actively to secure these three U.S. citizens' release."" The Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang acts as the ""protecting power for issues involving U.S. citizens in North Korea,"" and the United States is in ""regular, close coordination"" with the embassy, she said. Swedish representatives visited Fowle on June 20, Miller on May 9 and June 21, and Bae 12 times since his detention, most recently on August 11 in a labor camp, Psaki said. Surprise meetings . The circumstances leading up to the CNN interviews were bizarre. A CNN team was on a government tour about two hours outside Pyongyang when it learned it had to leave immediately to meet with a high-level government official in the capital. The crew boarded a van to a secret location, where it found out the meeting was with the three Americans. Bae's family has been pushing for his release due to his worsening health. The 46-year-old suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure and has kidney stones. ""I've been going back and forth between hospital and to the labor camp for the last year and a half,"" Bae told Ripley on Monday. He said his health has ""been failing"" over the past 1½ months. ""My hands are numb and tingling, and it's difficult sleeping at night, and I was working in the field every day,"" Bae said. U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korea to release Bae but to no avail. Even former basketball star Dennis Rodman, who has visited North Korea and called its ruler Kim Jong Un a ""friend for life,"" asked Kim to ""do me a solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose."" Terri Chung, Bae's sister, told CNN on Monday the video was ""really difficult to watch"" because her brother is generally ""full of life and very cheerful. ...  It is clear from the video that he is under a lot of stress. And he talks about his health failing and being in complete isolation for almost two years. And it is devastating for our family to see that on TV."" But she told ""New Day"" that ""I think he's doing the best he can. ... Two years of being isolated and working in a labor camp, I know it is not easy. So I think you can see it is taking a toll both physically and mentally."" The U.S. government has been working ""behind the scenes to try to procure his release, and we are once again reiterating our thanks, but also too pleading with our government to continue their efforts to secure his release immediately,"" she added, describing her brother as a ""hardworking father of three."" Chung later released a statement asking the North Korean authorities to have mercy. ""It is in your power to release my brother. You could do it today. Please do so. He has confessed to the crimes for which he has been charged, and he has served a longer detainment than any other American since the war,"" Chung said. Miller: 'I deliberately committed my crime' Dressed in a black turtleneck and often staring at the ground in his interview, Miller said he has admitted his guilt -- even though he won't learn of his charges until he goes to trial. ""But I will say that I prepared to violate the law of the DPRK before coming here,"" Miller said. ""And I deliberately committed my crime. I have already admitted my guilt and apologized to the government of the DPRK and I have been asking for forgiveness."" When asked why he reportedly sought asylum in North Korea, Miller said he already discussed his motive during his investigation and that ""for the interview, it is not necessary."" He expressed frustration that ""there's been no movement from my government."" ""The American government is known for having a strong policy of protecting its citizens, yet for my case there is still no movement,"" he said. Fowle describes 'desperate situation' North Korea announced Fowle's detention in June, saying he had violated the law by acting ""contrary to the purpose of tourism."" ""The charges are violations of DPRK law, which stems from me trying to leave a Bible,"" the 56-year-old told Ripley. ""It's a covert act and a violation of tourists rules. I've admitted my guilt to the government and signed a statement to that effect and requested forgiveness from the people and the government of the DPRK."" Fowle said he expects his trial to start within a month. ""You guys should convey my desperate situation,"" he said. ""I've got a wife and three elementary school-aged kids that depend on me for support.""","Kenneth Bae's sister asks North Korean authorities to have mercy .

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie killed plans for a new train tunnel to connect his state with New York's Manhattan island Thursday, saying billions of dollars in possible cost overruns made the project ""completely unthinkable."" The $8.7 billion tunnel beneath the Hudson River was the largest public works project in the United States, but Christie said it was likely to cost up to $5 billion more than estimated. In a statement announcing his plan to withdraw from the project, he said the tunnel ""costs far more than New Jersey taxpayers can afford, and the only prudent move is to end this project."" ""I have made a pledge to the people of New Jersey that on my watch I will not allow taxpayers to fund projects that run over budget with no clear way of how these costs will be paid for,"" said Christie, a Republican elected in 2009. ""Considering the unprecedented fiscal and economic climate our state is facing, it is completely unthinkable to borrow more money and leave taxpayers responsible for billions in cost overruns."" The tunnel, dubbed the Access to the Region's Core project, was aimed at doubling the number of commuter trains between New York and New Jersey and increasing the number of Amtrak trains serving the Northeast Corridor. It would have included an expansion of New York's Penn Station, created 6,000 jobs and taken 22,000 cars off the road, according to New Jersey Transit and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Thomas Wright, the head of the Regional Plan Association, said Christie's decision ""is really going to take a hit on New Jersey's economic growth."" He said the $5 billion estimate for overruns that Christie cited is overstated, with the actual number being closer to $1 billion. ""This is a potential overrun that's many years down the road. It should not have been used as the excuse to kill this project,"" he said. The Port Authority and the Federal Transit Administration each put up $3 billion for the Access to the Region's Core project, with the state of New Jersey adding in $2.7 billion. The project also was partially funded by federal stimulus money. ""New Jersey definitely has extreme financial burdens that they are dealing with,"" said Wright, the executive director of the transportation and urban planning think tank. ""However, Access to the Region's Core was one project that was very well funded from federal and bi-state sources. Very little of the money was actually coming from New Jersey citizens."" Opponents of the planned tunnel said they would rather see New Jersey's share of the money go to the state's Transportation Trust Fund, which is rapidly running out of money. Supporters of the project proposed covering any budget shortfalls with a surcharge on train tickets or an increase in New Jersey's gasoline tax, the third-lowest in the country. But Christie has said he's opposed to raising gasoline taxes. Christie said he has asked his state transportation commissioner and the head of the New Jersey Transit agency to work with federal and regional officials to find other ways to boost commuter capacity. ""However, any future project must recognize the regional and national scale of such an effort and work within the scope of the state's current fiscal and economic realities,"" he added. Christie had put a 30-day hold on the project in September to re-evaluate it. Wednesday, Department of Transportation spokesman Brian Farber said that Christie and U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood had spoken by telephone and ""agreed to have staff work together to further refine the estimated cost of the entire project, and those conversations are ongoing."" Now that the project has been killed, the Federal Transit Administration could redirect its funds to other projects across the United States. The $600 million already spent on the project may not be reimbursed. CNN's Steve Kastenbaum, Eden Pontz and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","NEW: Decision will hurt New Jersey, analyst says .

"For the first time in human history, more than half the world's population is living in cities, which now produce approximately 70 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. That puts cities on the frontlines of the battle against climate change -- and more and more cities are leading the charge. In New York, we began a frontal attack on climate change in 2007 with the release of our sustainability blueprint, PlaNYC -- and since then we've made major progress. For instance, we are well on our way to meeting our goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030. For coastal cities like New York, the risks of climate change are especially serious: sea levels are expected to rise by another two and a half feet in the next 40 years, making storm surges even more powerful and dangerous. And intense storms are likely to increase as the ocean's temperatures continue to rise. But it's not just storms. Droughts and heat waves may be longer and more intense for urban populations everywhere in the years to come. Around the world, city leaders are not wasting time debating the science of climate change or waiting around for international treaties to be signed; we are taking action. There's simply too much to do and too much at stake. For the past two years, I have been chairman of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, which includes some of the biggest and most innovative cities in the world. Thanks to C40's research, we know that C40 Cities have taken more than 4,700 actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the possible effects of climate change. In fact, C40 has the potential to reduce emissions by more than one billion tons a year by 2030 — which is equivalent to making both Canada and Mexico entirely carbon-neutral. In New York City, our actions to reduce our carbon footprint include planting more than a half-million new trees; banning the use of the most polluting forms of heating oil; and launching a major bike sharing initiative. The strict codes we've adopted for energy-efficiency in major commercial and residential buildings have the potential to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by at least five percent and save New Yorkers more than $750 million per year in energy costs. But our work to make our city more energy efficient is only half the battle. Last fall, Hurricane Sandy made all too clear how vitally important it is to build stronger and more sustainable infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather events. That's why in June, we launched a long-term plan specifically focused on protecting our city from the effects of climate change.e . For instance, we're working to strengthen dune systems and beaches across the city. Our plan includes surge barriers to prevent flooding and a strong network of bulkheads, floodwalls, levies, and other protections in vulnerable places along the waterfront. We are working with private companies and regulators to strengthen critical infrastructure against severe weather -- including our power, telecommunications, and transportation systems. And we're also raising construction standards to ensure new buildings can withstand extreme weather. In developing this plan, we looked around the world to identify best practices and innovative new solutions -- and that's the power of the C40 network.  It creates a forum for cities to share best practices and resources -- and even to collaborate with other cities and institutions. For instance, C40 has now formed partnerships with the World Bank and other international organizations that have expertise and resources, which are helping cities take bolder actions more quickly. In addition, C40 has focused on the research and data collection necessary to assess our progress, because I firmly believe in the maxim: If you can't measure it, you can't manage it. Mayors are pragmatists, not partisans; innovators, not ideologues.  We are responsible for delivering results, not debating politics.  And as the world becomes increasingly more urban, the importance of bold local action -- particularly on climate change -- will continue to grow.","New York City Mayor Bloomberg is chairman of C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group .

"As an infant 20 years ago, Spencer Elden was thrown into a pool in Southern California to be photographed, naked, underwater, appearing to reach for a dollar bill. The photo would become one of the most iconic images of 1990s music: Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" album cover. Released on September 24, 1991, ""Nevermind"" catapulted the band and its music to the top of the charts, with songs including ""Smells Like Teen Spirit""  giving birth to the Seattle-based grunge musical style. On the 20th anniversary of the album's release, Elden, the now-20-year-old son of an artist, said in jest  that now he suffers more tribulations than other famously photographed babies whose images are associated more with cuteness than grunge. ""When I am introduced, they introduce me as the Nirvana baby,"" said Elden. And because he was sans diaper when the famous shot was taken, there are other questions. ""They usually poke fun at me asking me, 'Is it the same size?'"" ""I always say, ""It's changed, do you want to see it?'"" Elden, also an artist, said he never met Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, whose looks and demeanor epitomized the '90s Generation-X subculture, a group and a mindset chronicled in films such as ""Slacker."" ""Definitely, I like Nirvana a lot and there are no songs that I don't like -- they all have a special place for people,"" Elden said. Elden said he is not swimming in cash as a result of his baby celebrity status. His father, artist Rick Elden, agreed in 1991 to work on the cover with fellow photographer Kirk Weddle. He received no royalties for the job. ""My dad was an artist rigging special effects for Hollywood,"" said Elden. ""They went to the local pool, threw me in the water and that was it. It was a friend-helping-a-friend kind of thing."" On Saturday, Elden said he celebrated the historic release of ""Nevermind"" with friends. ""We hung out ... and just listened to Nirvana music, drank beer and hung out. It was a good time,"" he said.","As a baby, Spencer Elden was thrown into a pool for the cover photo of Nirvana's famous album .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration has filed a request with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to stay a lower court injunction stopping the military policy regarding openly gay troops serving. Late Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Virginia Phillips in California denied the government's request for an emergency stay of her order barring the military from expelling openly gay service members. That ruling came as the Pentagon has begun advising recruiting commands that they can accept openly gay and lesbian recruit candidates, according to a Pentagon spokeswoman. The guidance from the Personnel and Readiness office was sent to recruiting commands on Friday, according to spokeswoman Cynthia Smith. The recruiters were told that if a candidate admits he or she is openly gay, and qualify under normal recruiting guidelines, their application can be processed. Recruiters are not allowed to ask candidates if they are gay as part of the application process. The notice also reminded recruiters that they have to ""manage expectations"" of applicants by informing them that a reversal of the court decision might occur, whereby the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy could be reinstated, Smith said. Groups representing gays and lesbians have warned against coming out to the military because the policy is still being appealed in courts. One group, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, sent a statement out Tuesday reiterating the concern. ""During this interim period of uncertainty, service members must not come out and recruits should use caution if choosing to sign up,"" SLDN Executive Director Aubrey Sarvis said in the statement. ""The bottom line: if you come out now, it can be used against you in the future by the Pentagon."" Judge Phillips' ruling on ""don't ask, don't tell"" stemmed from a lawsuit by Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, challenging the policy. Former Army Lt. Daniel Choi, an Iraq war combat veteran who challenged ""don't ask, don't tell"" and was discharged, moved to rejoin the military Tuesday afternoon. ""I'm here because I want to serve my country,"" he said. ""In the recruiting station. Apparently I'm too old for the Marines!"" he said in a tweet. ""Just filled out the Army application."" Choi said he told recruiters he was gay and that there was no reaction or delay in the enlistment process. He indicated he would complete his paperwork Wednesday and that he did not care what rank he would assume. Will Rodriguez-Kennedy, president of Log Cabin Republicans' San Diego, California, office, tried Tuesday afternoon to be reinstated by the Marines. ""Once a Marine, always a Marine,"" said Rodriguez-Kennedy, a corporal who was honorably discharged in February 2008. He served three years of a four-year term. ""It's a feeling of not having completed a full tour,"" he said. Recruiters told him Tuesday there were no current slots and they would call him in January, Rodriguez-Kennedy said. One option is to join another branch of the service, but Rodriguez-Kennedy said he might speak with Marine officers or get legal help. Reinstatement would allow him to keep the corporal rank and resume benefits. Rodriguez-Kennedy, 23, served as a provisional military police officer in Iraq in 2007. He said he was open to new responsibilities. ""I love the Marine Corps,"" he said. CNN called several recruiting stations in New York and Chicago. They referred inquiries to the Pentagon.

Danes has played the troubled but brilliant intelligence officer Carrie Mathison on Showtime's ""Homeland"" since 2011, and Sunday night's win marked her second victory in a row as lead actress in a drama.

"(CNN) -- Black voters allowed themselves to be used by Sen. Thad Cochran to win the Republican primary runoff for Mississippi's U.S. Senate seat. Cochran beat state Sen. Chris McDaniel by targeting black Democrats and getting them to vote for him in a tight race. It was a brilliant political strategy in a state that allows open primaries, where voters can cross party lines to vote. It also showed blacks -- and the Republican Party that ignores them -- that black voters can wield political influence. Cochran won the runoff by a little over 6,000 votes. The runoff was triggered because no candidate garnered 50% of the vote in the first primary, which Cochran lost to McDaniel by some 1,000 votes. But make no mistake, Cochran appealed to black Democratic voters out of desperation. When was the last time we heard Cochran reaching out to ask for the black vote in the last six terms he's served as senator? Cochran's campaign suggested McDaniel was a tea party radical. The tea party has become code for ""racist"" among many black Americans, who overwhelmingly vote Democratic. Black Democratic voters allowed themselves to be exploited by Cochran's boogeyman -- the tea party nonsense -- without looking into the policies and records of each candidate. McDaniel was a conservative candidate opposed to illegal immigration, which harms black Americans. The black unemployment rate has been higher than the national average for the past five years and blacks often compete for the same jobs as undocumented workers. Refusing to concede the election, McDaniel and other conservatives said Cochran played dirty politics by reaching out to black Democrats to win. It's true these same voters will likely vote for the Democratic nominee in the fall. But I suspect McDaniel is just angry he didn't think of the idea first. It was distasteful to see conservatives like Laura Ingraham accuse Cochran of race-baiting because he decided to ask black Democrats to vote for him. How is asking blacks to cast a vote for you race-baiting? While I don't agree with how Cochran won and wish blacks were more informed about their vote, Cochran bothered to ask blacks to vote for him, something that apparently makes some Republicans cringe. Even the Democrat-dominated Congressional Black Caucus has now applauded his use of blacks to win. Go figure. Many blacks would say the Republican Party only works in earnest for the white vote. Presidential nominee Mitt Romney did a good job of winning the majority of the white vote (60%) in 2012, but he lost the election because he ignored the minority and woman voters -- that is, he hardly bothered to ask for their votes. This Mississippi primary race is a harbinger of what can happen to the GOP in future national elections if Republicans continue to ignore the black vote. They will lose. Instead of allowing themselves to vote solely based on misleading headlines and misinformation, blacks need to be voting based upon candidates' positions on issues and how they affect them. Come November, I doubt Cochran will really care about earning the black vote and taking the Republican message of equal opportunity and economic empowerment to blacks. Blacks just believed the hype about McDaniel being a racist and didn't dig any deeper. Cochran will run in the general election ignoring black voters, just as the GOP has done for the past 40 years. This isn't a watershed moment. It's another example of blacks throwing away their political influence -- as they have on the Democratic Party since 1964 -- and getting nothing in return. Cochran demonstrates what many black conservatives already know: GOP candidates will only reach out to black voters, kicking and screaming, as a last resort to win. This isn't the path to future Republican victories in truly competitive national races in a country where census data show the white population declining while minorities are growing. The big takeaway from the Cochran win is that Republicans had better get serious.

"(CNN) -- The mother of a college student who died of alcohol poisoning at Cornell University is suing Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity for $25 million in a lawsuit that alleges fraternity pledges bound her son's wrists and ankles and forced him to drink alcohol in a hazing ritual on the night of his death. George Desdunes, 19, was a sophomore member of the fraternity when he died in February. The wrongful death lawsuit, which was filed by Marie Lourdes Andre in Brooklyn Supreme Court on Monday, alleges he was kidnapped by a group of Sigma Alpha Epsilon pledges and forced to drink alcohol and other substances while being quizzed about the fraternity. ""The kidnapping and ensuing events were part of a long-standing fraternity ritual that was authorized and encouraged by SAE chapter officers and members,"" reads the complaint. He was then left on a couch in the fraternity house where he lived, where he was found by a housekeeper the next morning. Desdunes, an aspiring doctor, had a blood alcohol content of 0.409% -- more than five times the legal limit -- when he was found, according to the lawsuit. ""It's every parent's nightmare,"" said William Friedlander, Andre's lawyer, who added that the lawsuit is ""not about the money,"" but to bring attention to the issue of hazing. ""Our object is to get the secret rituals out in the open,"" Friedlander said. ""It's a way to hold (fraternities) accountable for their policies."" The lawsuit cites at least three other alcohol-related deaths of Sigma Alpha Epsilon members or pledges, including, most recently, the 2009 death of University of Kansas pledge Jason Wren. The parents of California Polytechnic State University student Carson Starkey, who died of alcohol poisoning as a Sigma Alpha Epsilon pledge in 2008, settled a similar lawsuit against the fraternity, said their lawyer, Douglas Fierberg. ""The circumstances leading to Carson's death are substantially similar to the circumstances leading to George's death,"" Fierberg said. In a statement addressing Andre's lawsuit, officials at Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national headquarters said that the Cornell chapter of the fraternity was suspended after Desdunes' death. ""Sigma Alpha Epsilon maintains stringent policies and guidelines for its chapters as part of its risk-management program and reaffirms its zero-tolerance policy for actions that do not comply with our regulations,"" the statement reads. ""Members are expected to adhere to our fraternity policies and to uphold behavior consistent with our creed, 'The True Gentleman.'"" Cornell University, located in Ithaca, New York, withdrew recognition of the fraternity for at least five years. ""George Desdunes' death was a tragedy for our campus community,"" said Tommy Bruce, Cornell's vice president of communications, in a statement. ""We want to be clear that Cornell University neither condones nor tolerates hazing or the type of activities that we understand contributed to George's death."" ""The matter is now in litigation, and we will be following it closely as it progresses through the courts,"" Bruce said.","Sophomore member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon died with blood alcohol content of 0.409% .

"(CNN)  -- The American Medical Association, the nation's largest organization of physicians, apologized Thursday for its history of discriminatory policies toward African-American physicians, including those that effectively restricted membership to whites. Dr. Nelson L. Adams said the AMA's  practices had a ""devastating"" effect on African-Americans' health. ""We are apologizing for policies and practices that we had that ... are offensive to AMA leaders today,"" the organization's immediate past president, Dr. Ronald M. Davis, told CNN. ""Our major goal in this matter is to confront the past to build a better future."" For a long portion of the organization's history, the AMA required that its members belong to a state or local medical society, groups that in some states did not allow African-Americans as members, Davis said. ""AMA declined to take actions against those societies,"" he said, and ""few African-Americans ... were able to become members of AMA for that reason."" The move comes amid a number of efforts undertaken by the organization in recent decades to lessen racial inequality in the field of medicine. They include: attempts to increase the number of African-Americans who enter medical school, recruiting African-Americans and minorities for AMA membership, and addressing racial disparities in health care. The National Medical Association, an African-American physician group founded in 1895 when AMA membership was out of reach for most African-Americans, said it accepted the apology. ""We commend the AMA for taking this courageous step and coming to grips with a litany of discriminatory practices that have had a devastating effect on the health of African-Americans,"" the organization's president, Dr. Nelson L. Adams, said in a written statement. However, the organization said that the AMA's policies of discrimination have contributed to disparity in health care for African-Americans. ""These persistent, race-based health disparities have led to a precipitous decline in the health of African-Americans when compared to their white counterparts and the population as a whole,"" Dr. Nedra H. Joyner, chair of the NMA's board of trustees, said in the statement. Joyner said African-Americans disproportionately suffer from chronic diseases that include heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. ""In accepting this apology for past wrongs, it is important we seize this opportunity to move forward to correct these injustices,"" she said.","Largest U.S. physicians group apologizes for previous discrimination .

"A handful of Republican Party officials is quietly advancing a new batch of rules aimed at streamlining a chaotic presidential nominating process that many party insiders viewed as damaging to the their campaign for the White House in 2012, multiple GOP sources told CNN. In a series of closed-door meetings since August, handpicked members of the Republican National Committee have been meeting with party Chairman Reince Priebus in Washington to hash out details of a sweeping plan to condense the nominating calendar, severely punish primary and caucus states that upend the agreed-upon voting order and potentially move the party's national convention to earlier in the summer, with late June emerging as the ideal target date. No party convention has been held that early since the steamy summer of 1948, when Republicans nominated Thomas Dewey as their standard bearer in Philadelphia. The 17-member special rules subcommittee tasked with reforming the nominating process, appointed with little fanfare at the RNC's summer meeting in Boston, is also considering ways to limit the number of Republican primary debates in 2016, though the group has yet to agree to any specific rules related to debates. The 2012 campaign saw an eye-popping 20 Republican debates, in addition to an array of multicandidate forums. GOP tries to deal with damage done with women . Priebus and other top party figures have made no secret of their desire to scale back the number of debates, which offered little-known candidates such as Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain a chance to shine but forced Mitt Romney, the eventual nominee, to publicly stake out a number of conservative positions that came back to haunt him in the general election. Fewer debates, more control . One proposal being weighed by the RNC members would involve sanctioning a small handful of debates while penalizing candidates who participate in any nonsanctioned GOP debate by stripping them of one-third of their delegates to the national convention. There is also a ""heavy appetite"" to have a say over which journalists should be allowed to moderate the debates, said one Republican familiar with the ongoing discussions. ""There is a definitely a consensus for Reince's objective to have less debates and have control over how and who we have run our debates, rather than just turning it over to X, Y or Z network and having a guy moderate who's going to just dog you for two hours,"" said the Republican, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive and not-yet-finalized rules changes. Calendar changes approved by the subcommittee must then be ratified by the RNC's Standing Committee on Rules, a vote that could take place as early as January at the RNC's winter meeting in Washington. If approved by the rules committee, the full 168-member RNC must vote on the calendar changes sometime before next summer. The biggest campaign moments of 2013 . The rules subcommittee is a mixed bag of veteran party pragmatists and grassroots conservatives who have bristled at past attempts to impose order on the primary and caucus process. But people on the subcommittee say the discussions have been cordial and productive -- a far cry from the internecine Republican warfare that has come to define the party during the Obama era. 'The grassroots have a voice' ""I think all groups are being represented,"" said subcommittee member James Smack, a libertarian-leaning supporter of Ron and Rand Paul from Nevada. ""The grassroots have a voice in that room,"" he said. ""The so-called establishment has a voice in that room. And people who don't really fall into either camp have a voice in the room. It's a friendly group. I thought it might be more adversarial, but to be honest, everybody has had their ability to be heard."" Among the rules amendments taking shape: . -- The first four early-voting states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada -- would continue to hold their contests in February. To prevent other states from jumping the order and compelling the first four to move their dates even earlier as they did in 2012, any state that attempts to hold its nominating contest before March 1 would have their number of delegates to the convention slashed to just nine people or, in the case of smaller states, one-third of their delegation -- whichever number is smaller. ""It's the death penalty,"" said one member of the subcommittee. If Florida violates RNC rules and holds its primary in February, its 99-member delegation would all but vanish. -- Any state holding a primary or caucus during the first two weeks of March must award its delegates proportionally, rather than winner-take-all. The measure is designed to prevent a candidate from catching fire in the early states and then riding a burst of momentum to winner-take-all victories in expensive, delegate-rich states such as Florida or Texas. The early March window would give underfunded, insurgent candidates a chance to prove their mettle. ""It will allow a grassroots candidate to stay in the race and try to raise money and score some wins,"" said Smack. ""If they can't score wins by that time, they probably need to pack it in and try again four years later."" -- States holding a contest after March 15 can decide to award their delegates however they see fit. -- The Republican National Convention will be held either in late June or early July, though ideally on a date before the July 4 holiday. The decision on where to hold the convention will be made at a later date by a separate RNC panel, but Las Vegas and Kansas City are seen as two early frontrunners. Party officials said each city's host committee seems willing and able to raise the nearly $60 million needed to fund a sprawling convention. Asked about the proposals, RNC Communications Director Sean Spicer said the measures ""reflect the chairman's conversations with the grassroots of our party and are intended to give the next nominee the financing and resources necessary to win in 2016."" Should poll give GOP hope? Not yet . Would earlier convention bring better results? Of all the changes, the convention date is perhaps the most crucial and sought-after adjustment in the wake of Romney's 2012 loss. For many in the party, the primary process dragged for too long, with too many loose ends and hurt feelings, before Romney was formally declared the nominee at the Tampa, Florida, convention in late August. Moving the convention to June would have the effect of ending the primary campaign in May because of RNC rules that require state party organizations to submit their delegate lists to the national party at least 35 days before the convention. States with primaries scheduled for June 2016, including California, New Jersey and New Mexico, would essentially be holding nothing more than beauty contests. Party organizations in those states would instead submit their delegate lists to the RNC ahead of time, before any primary vote takes place, Republicans said. But perhaps more importantly, subcommittee members said, an early convention date will give the 2016 nominee a massive financial edge over what Romney had in 2012. Handcuffed from spending campaign funds raised for the general election until he was officially nominated in late August, Romney was outspent by a 3-to-1 margin on the television airwaves throughout the summer by President Barack Obama and his allies. Democrats defined Romney early as an out-of-touch plutocrat, and he never recovered his image. By moving the convention to late June, the 2016 nominee will be able to open up his or her general election war chest a full two months earlier. ""The main thing is it makes him or her the official nominee, and then they can spend the general election money,"" said a Republican involved in the deliberations. ""That is the number one reason to move the convention, to give the nominee the flexibility to start spending that money. It used to be you didn't want to go early, because you would run out of money. Now no one is taking government money, so you can go raise a gazillion dollars. We will raise what we need to raise."" For many years, both parties held their conventions later in the summer, a strategic decision meant to preserve federal matching funds available to each candidate under public financing. But with campaigns now awash in outside money and permissive fundraising regulations, it now makes little sense for candidates to wait for a smaller pot of publicly financed money. Obama and Romney declined federal matching funds in 2012, the first time since the Watergate era that both major party nominees passed on public financing in the general election.","RNC plan would condense primary calendar and punish states that upend voting order .

"Events to mark Earth Day have been taking place around the globe on Sunday as people join together to celebrate and promote environmental causes. From conservation efforts in El Savador to parades by activists in Indonesia, this year's event is as colorful and diverse as ever uniting over a billion people in 192 countries, according to organizers, Earth Day Network. Earth Day is focusing efforts on creating ""A Billion Acts of Green"" in 2012. Stunning images of Earth from space . Billed as ""the world's largest environmental service campaign,"" organizers hope the effort will demonstrate widespread support for coordinated action to tackle environmental issues. Pledges large and small have been flooding into the official Earth Day web site since its launch in November 2010 and a rally at the National Mall in Washington D.C. on Sunday will coordinate a final push to break through the one billion barrier. The environment has been ""put on the backburner by world leaders,"" according to Kathleen Rogers, president of Earth Day Network. ""That's why we're coming together on the Mall and standing in solidarity with millions of people at thousands of Earth Day events around the world,"" Rogers said in a statement on the Earth Day web site. Earth Day by numbers . Earth Day was conceived by U.S. senator Gaylord Nelson in 1970 after he witnessed a massive oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara, California the previous year. The inaugural event attracted the support of 20 million Americans but has grown rapidly in recent decades. In 1990, Earth Day saw 200 million people participate in 141 countries, according to organizers and by the turn of the century over 5,000 environmental groups worldwide were involved.","Over a billion people around the world expected to participate in events to mark Earth Day .

"How many of you have felt victimized by a Regina George? If you raised your hand, you can attest that even a decade later ""Mean Girls"" still holds up. Whether it's because Tina Fey's script so authentically captures the high school experience or because of the multiple quote-worthy lines (admit it, you are glad ""fetch"" happened), the film about a group of teen girls who rule the school and the girl they sort of take under their wing is as popular now as it ever was. ""For the high-school genre, Fey's hilarious script was unusually astute and provocative,"" the Guardian said of the film in 2013. ""Replicating teen doublespeak with brilliant authenticity, the dialogue was full of zingers, accounting for its continued life online."" April 30 marks the 10-year anniversary of the now cult classic. Not only can the 2004 movie be seen in heavy rotation on cable stations, but thanks to Netflix anyone can enjoy the adventures of ""the Plastics."" Social media has also fully embraced it with Tumblrs and trending hashtags devoted to the characters and their snappy dialogue. Before gay rights were even being fully embraced, the movie offered up the loveable character of Damian, who was ""too gay to function"" and partial to singing Christina Aguilera's songs in the school talent show.  And for those who have witnessed the train wreck that has become the life and career of ""Mean Girls"" star Lindsay Lohan, it also serves as a bittersweet time capsule of the days when she was billed as one of the most promising young actresses of her generation. Based on the 2002 nonfiction book ""Queen Bees and Wannabes"" by Rosalind Wiseman, actress and screenwriter  Fey was able to find the funny in what is often the victimization of young women in school. In the film, Cady Heron is a 16-year-old daughter of zoologist parents who moves from Africa to the United States and is enrolled in public school after having been home schooled. She quickly catches the attention of the Plastics, a clique of girls who indoctrinate her into their ways, including rules about what days to wear pink and the fact that ""ex-boyfriends are off-limits to friends. That's just, like, the rules of feminism."" When friends become bullies . What follows is a war of manipulation, lies and revenge. Fey told The New York Times that it was all quite familiar. ""I revisited high school behaviors of my own — futile, poisonous, bitter behaviors that served no purpose,"" Fey said. ""That thing of someone saying 'You're really pretty' and then, when the other person thanks them, saying, 'Oh, so you agree? You think you're pretty?' That happened in my school. That was a bear trap."" In fact, ""Mean Girls"" has become a sort of cultural shorthand for Machiavellian-type machinations -- as well as a favored pop culture reference. During the 2013 government shutdown, the ""Mean Girls of Capitol Hill"" Tumblr blog grew in popularity, and when Jennifer Lawrence won a 2013 People's Choice Award, she said ""I wish this was like 'Mean Girls' and I could just break this (award) up and throw it at all of you because you're all responsible."" The movie grossed just over $129 million worldwide and helped cement the career of Lohan and launch others, including Amanda Seyfried, who told the Los Angeles Times it was her ""best work."" ""I look back and I'm like, 'Really, I thought I was doing a terrible job,"" Seyfried said. ""But it was written so well and so wonderfully directed. (Director) Mark Waters made me look good; he made me funny. And Tina Fey wrote the coolest script of all time. I'm so grateful for every experience."" The film is still so popular that news that a musical is in the works has been greeted with panting anticipation from diehard fans. In October 2013 (and no, not on October 3, the date that has significant meaning to Cady in the film), Fey's husband, composer Jeff Richmond -- who is scoring the musical -- told Vulture that progress was being made in developing it. So, while you wait, and in honor of ""Mean Girls,"" grab your Burn Book or whatever you use to trash people (around here we call it ""the  comments section""), sit back and maybe revisit the movie. Do it for Glen Coco.","""Mean Girls"" was released 10 years ago .

"China downplayed India's successful missile launch this week, saying that the two sides are not rivals but cooperating partners. ""China and India are both emerging countries, we are not rivals but cooperation partners,"" said Liu Weimin, China's foreign ministry spokesman, on Thursday. ""We believe the two countries should cherish the hard-won momentum of sound bilateral relations, promote bilateral friendship and cooperation and make active contributions to regional peace and stability."" India's government touted the successful Thursday launch of the Agni V missile -- with a range of 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) capable of hitting cities as far as Shanghai -- as a milestone for the country. ""This launch has given a message to the entire world that India has the capability to design, develop, build and manufacture missiles of this class, and we are today a missile power,"" VK Saraswat, chief of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, told India's Economic Times. The Agni V missile is a 17.5-meter-tall (75-feet), three-stage missile designed to carry a 1.5-ton nuclear warhead and is expected to be ready for use by the armed forces in 2014 following a series of tests, the report said. India's major media outlets touted the launch as India's entry into an elite club of countries, including the United States and Russia. But China's state-backed Global Times newspaper reported in an editorial that, ""India shouldn't overestimate its strength."" ""India should be clear that China's nuclear power is stronger and more reliable,"" the editorial said. ""For the foreseeable future, India would stand no chance in an overall arms race with China."" While China has not perceived India as a threat, experts say India has boosted military spending in recent years in part due to China's increasing dominance in the Indian Ocean. The two sides fought a war in 1962 over border issues. ""This launch is a part of India's development and modernization,"" said Ye Hailin, an international relations expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""Some reports of the perceived threats have been exaggerated and I think we should take a step back from this rather than jump to conclusions.""","China downplayed India's successful missile launch this week .

"This week, House Speaker John Boehner announced that the House will not consider immigration reform this year. Despite growing numbers and increasing political influence of the nation's Latino population, the House leadership has chosen to show it disrespect. How shameful. Here is some context: Last year, 409,849 human beings -- mothers, fathers, sons and daughters -- were torn from their families and deported. Millions have been exploited, forced to live in unrelenting fear of workplace raids and criminalized as they seek a fair pathway to citizenship. An entire generation of immigrants, the majority of whom are immigrants of color, are relegated to second-class status. Sadly, many of the same corporations that build the country's correctional facilities also build and run prison-like immigrant detention facilities. Since the Illegal Immigration Reform Act and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which cuts off long-standing policies of pardoning eligible immigrants who were at one point undocumented, and since 9/11, even the path to legality and recognition as human beings with equal rights has become an illusion. The breakdown of our democratic values does not end there. The path to equal representation in our democracy — our fundamental right to vote — must also be urgently addressed. On June 25, the Supreme Court struck down the formula of the Voting Rights Act needed for the federal government to protect rights in states with long histories of discrimination. Just two hours after the decision, Texas announced it would reinstate its strict voter ID law. This law had already been struck down by the Justice Department as discriminatory against Latinos and African Americans -- groups significantly less likely to have the limited forms of government-issued photo ID required under the law. Florida has followed suit by purging its voting rolls, ensnaring former immigrants who are now citizens despite the lack of measurable non-citizen voter fraud. Under the purge procedure, Florida's immigrant communities may be at risk of getting hit with letters questioning their citizenship status, hearing dates, requirements to show their papers and the costs of replacing lost documents. The state renewed this intimidating attempt to scare off communities of naturalized citizens, despite having settled a discrimination claim brought over a similar purge in 2012 by Advancement Project, Latino Justice, other national voting rights groups, and Florida-based Latino and Haitian American community groups. In state after state across the country, voter ID and other ""show me your papers to vote"" laws, laws that disparately impact immigrants of color, are being pursued at an alarming rate. Given our nation's long history of racial discrimination, it is perhaps not surprising that there is a great backlash against inclusion and equality as the face of our nation changes and the immigrant population grows dramatically.  Restrictions on voting rights based on race have been going on since formerly enslaved black Americans first became ""citizens"" and eligible to vote. But disenfranchisement is not the American way. True democracy is impossible if millions have no road map to become citizens, and if those who are citizens have their voting rights challenged at every turn. For a true and just democracy, we must dismantle any ethnic and racial barriers to citizenship and voting rights. Only when each person, regardless of race or ethnicity, is allowed to equally participate will our fundamental notions of citizenship and democracy -- and indeed, the American dream -- be realized.","Katherine Culliton-González: Boehner says House won't take up immigration reform .

"Hoof by hoof, Harold Kelly's family of horses crest the hill, kicking up dust, treading over stones and packed dirt. It's another 70-degree day in central California. In the dead of winter, there's not a cloud in sight.  And there's no rain in the forecast. Fifty horses trot on Kelly's 300-acre spread outside of Fresno, part of a vast valley that's a farming and ranching hub to the nation. ""Every horse out here I've raised, but for the exception of two,"" Kelly declares. His herd sips from a water trough, an oasis that's suddenly taken on greater meaning. The surrounding hills show brown soil where there should be lush, green pasture. That's because a historic disaster is unfolding: California is facing perhaps its worst drought since record-keeping began a century ago, California Gov. Jerry Brown proclaimed this month. At the center of this ongoing catastrophe are farmers and ranchers like Kelly, pushed to their financial limits. ""Normally, it'd be raining and we'd have grass growing,"" Kelly remarks. ""The grass is basically all gone."" There's nothing on the ground for Kelly's animals to eat. Winter is California's wet season, but it hasn't rained on Kelly's ranch in unincorporated Tivy Valley, near Sanger, since December 7, 2013. Even on that day, just a few drops fell -- exactly 0.15 inches -- according to Paul Jones, cooperative program manager at the National Weather Service. In fact, the area's rainfall for 2013 was 3.01 inches, compared with an average year of 11.5 inches. Kelly is now teetering on the brink of monetary collapse -- like many other ranchers and farmers in California's Central Valley, a breadbasket to the country as it stretches most of the state's length roughly from Sacramento to Bakersfield. ""I borrowed money -- I hate to even say that -- but I recently borrowed money to buy hay,"" the proud rancher says. With hay prices on the rise because of the drought, Kelly spends $800 to 1,000 a week on feed. That's money that he doesn't have. ""I don't really have much of a choice. That's the way I look at it."" Even so, his horses have cantered to better days. ""Some of them have dropped off a little bit in weight,"" Kelly says, taking a look at a mare whose ribs are beginning to show. ""They would be fat if there was rain."" Kelly has now decided that he must sell some of his horses. ""I hate to get rid of them...but it's time,"" he says. What's causing this strange weather pattern? Financial toll . The exact financial impact of the historic drought in California -- as well as a moderate to extreme drought throughout the American West -- has yet to be calculated by state and federal officials or farming and ranching associations. But the financial blow could be in the billions of dollars, especially if the 2012 national drought is any indication. That disaster cost the country $30 billion, according to the National Climatic Data Center. In the Central Valley's agriculture sector alone, the potential impact could exceed $1 billion in 2014 unless relief is provided, according to the Westlands Water District. Already, about 200,000 of 600,000 acres of prime farmland in Fresno and Kings Counties won't be planted this year because of the drought, the district said. That fallow land amounts to about 312 square miles. Some federal relief is uncertain because Congress hasn't been able to pass a farm bill since last year. Federal officials are seeking a bill that would provide retroactive disaster assistance to livestock producers who've been forced to thin their herds ""to the lowest level in decades"" because of the long-term drought, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Congress has been divided on a proposed bill's food stamp and dairy pricing programs, said Justin Oldfield, a vice president with the California Cattlement's Association. The governor's drought emergency, which included the entire state, won't help ranchers much because the measure allows water agencies to move water from northern to southern California, unless those cattlemen are located in a benefiting water district, Oldfield said. ""This is by far the worst drought that we've had, and in terms of ranchers, it's the worst drought since the '70s and some say it's worst than that,"" Oldfield said. ""If they have to sell cows, it will be extremely devastating for them. But they will work through it and come back. The people don't quit."" Federal officials also fear ranchers going bust overnight. ""That's why we keep pushing daily for Congress to get something done,"" said U.S. Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Courtney Rowe. Weirdly warm, dry winters spur bears to stop hibernating, start eating . Horses as family . Central California's fields and tree crops -- which provide half of the nation's fruits, nuts and vegetables -- are deteriorating. The state holds 80,500 farms and ranches, which together generate more than $100 billion in economic activity, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture . The bad turn in nature has forced Kelly to find other ways to keep his horses alive on his ranch about 200 miles north of Los Angeles. Every day, he fills his truck with hay purchased through a retailer, and drives into the dry pasture to feed his herd. He gives a loud whistle, and they come running. ""There are a whole lot of people like me. Some of them are hurting worse than I am,"" he said. To this life-long horse trainer and rancher, horses aren't just a business -- it's lifestyle and family. ""Hey, little girl,"" he says to a chestnut mare who approaches his side. ""It's pretty hard. Sometimes you don't have any choice. You don't have to be too smart to figure out this is what I need to do. ""It's on the verge of very desperate"" In Wednesday's State of the State address, Brown underlined the need to cut back on water resources. He's already called for a voluntary 20% conservation effort statewide. ""Right now, it is imperative that we do everything possible to mitigate the effects of the drought. We need everyone in every part of the state to conserve water.  We need regulators to rebalance water rules and enable voluntary transfers of water, and we must prepare for forest fires,"" Brown said. ""Among all our uncertainties, weather is one of the most basic. We can't control it. We can only live with it, and now we have to live with a very serious drought of uncertain duration,"" he said. Those who make their living off the land and its animals are desperate for relief from the parched conditions. Anthony Caglia runs Sidelver Wings Horse Rescue, dedicated to the rehabilitation and placement of orphaned horses. As Kelly's neighbor and fellow horseman, he's promised to do what he can to help -- even as he struggles in the face of the drought. His 60-acre equine ranch is at capacity with thoroughbreds, quarter horses and appaloosas up for adoption. Since the dry spell hit, calls for help have increased significantly. ""Usually, we get a phone call two to four times a month,"" he said. ""We're getting them two to three times a week now. We're at capacity, there's a waiting list."" Like Kelly, Caglia now purchases hay for the rescue horses and relies on donations to keep his organization running. ""I've been in this area all my life, and I've never seen it this bad. It was just upon us so fast. Hopefully we can get some rain, get some pasture back in and get some people back to work. It's on the verge of very desperate,"" he said. ""The farmers don't have anyone working. Nobody has money."" Caglia said. He says many people are considering sending their horses to slaughter. ""It's money for them, they can't get money otherwise. We like to let the horses live their lives out here. The founding of the ranch was to pay back the horse. The horse is what brought us here today. It took us across the United States, it brought our food in, it plowed our fields, it got us to town and back. It's a payback to the horse."" ""In a month from now, I won't have many left."" Across the road in Tivy Valley, Kelly has six to eight horses leaving for new homes in the coming weeks. They'll be separated and sent in trailers to different parts of the state. Equestrian Marcee Hansen will be one of the new owners: she's taking a 3-month-old colt off Kelly's hands to raise in her own. But not everyone shares Hansen's intention of raising a horse, Kelly says. Potential buyers have offered money per pound for each horse, a telltale sign of a plan to send the horse to slaughter. ""I'd rather borrow money and feed the horses than see them go to slaughter ... I'm not going to let them starve, whatever it takes,"" Kelly said. He expects he'll adopt-out every single one of his horses, but plays with the idea of keeping just one or two around for company. ""I've gotten close to them. They become a little bit like kids,"" he says. ""They become like a person, like a friend you're saying good bye to.""","Rancher Harold Kelly loves his horses, but he's going broke feeding them in the drought .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- Gaza's night skies were illuminated Friday by clashes between Israeli forces and Hamas militants throughout the 27-mile-long Palestinian territory. With fighting reported all along the coastal enclave, casualties poured into Gaza City's Shifaa Hospital, including children, after Israeli artillery shelled east of the city, physicians told the Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV. The conflict raged for a second night and came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned earlier in the day that ground troops are prepared to expand an offensive against Hamas militants. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will travel Saturday or Sunday to Qatar, ""where we're exerting every possible effort in order to do one thing: stop this bloodshed,"" said chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat. ""In the last 24 hours, 68 Palestinians have been killed, the infrastructure has been destroyed, more than 20,000 homes have been damaged or totally destroyed. This madness must stop,"" Erakat told CNN in phone interview from Turkey in the early hours of Saturday. Abbas was meeting with the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and spoke earlier with Pope Francis about the conflict. ""We are doing whatever we can,"" Erakat said. Israeli tanks and soldiers are plunging deeper into Gaza, and the fighting against Hamas led to a high toll of casualties and a doubling of displaced Palestinians to 40,000. That prompted a U.N. relief agency to seek $60 million, authorities said. President Barack Obama said Friday he spoke with Netanyahu and restated U.S. support for Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas rockets being fired from Gaza. ""In fact, while I was having the conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, sirens went off in Tel Aviv,"" Obama said. Those sirens sounded in response to a Hamas rocket attack on the coastal Israeli city, an Israeli government spokesman said. But Obama also said he hoped Israel's ground assault on Gaza would continue to take an approach that ""minimizes civilian casualties."" ""I also made clear that the United States and our friends and allies are deeply concerned about the risks of further escalation and the loss of more innocent life,"" Obama said. The Israel Defense Forces are targeting tunnels used by Hamas and others to slip into Israel and to smuggle in weaponry and supplies. Netanyahu did not explain what would spark a wider offensive or what it would entail. But he said Israel had no choice but to take the fight to Gaza to protect its own people. ""We chose to commence this operation after we had exhausted the other possibilities,"" he said, ""and with the understanding that without action, the price that we would pay would be much greater."" Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zhuri condemned the Prime Minister. ""Netanyahu is killing our children, and he will pay the price. The ground invasion is not scaring us. We pledge to drown the occupation army in Gaza's mud,"" Abu Zhuri said. Four ground incursions, 90 airstrikes . The Israeli military conducted at least four ground incursions into Gaza and about 90 airstrikes, said Jeffrey Feltman, the U.N. undersecretary general for political affairs, in a briefing Friday to the U.N. Security Council. Israel also fired 91 missiles, 357 tank shells and 150 shells from warships, Feltman said. Hamas militants fired 127 rockets and 29 mortar shells at Israel since Thursday, Feltman said. The Israeli military counted 135 rockets fired from Gaza since Thursday, with about 87 of them hitting Israel. One hit a kindergarten in Gan Yavne and another damaged a home in the Sha'ar HaNegev regional council. Israeli forces struck ""some 240 terror activity sites"" in Gaza and found 10 tunnels with 22 exits across the territory, the military said. Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was scheduled to travel to the region Saturday in an effort to ""end the violence and find a way forward,"" Feltman said. The grim task of counting casualties . The warfare between Israeli forces and Hamas militants has made for high casualties. The Palestinian Health Ministry said that at least 271 Gaza residents have died and more than 2,000 have been injured in the territory since Israel began its military campaign against Hamas last week. At least 24 of the deaths occurred since the ground offensive started late Thursday, the ministry said. Most of the casualties have been civilians, according to the United Nations. Among the deaths Friday were eight members of the same Palestinian family -- including four children -- in Beit Hanoun, the Gaza Health Ministry said. The Abu Jurad family members were killed when Israeli artillery fire landed on their home in northern Gaza, the agency said. At one point, about 20 Palestinian houses were hit in the fighting when the death toll stood at 26, Feltman said. The IDF said early Friday that one Israeli soldier was killed by friendly fire in northern Gaza, the second Israeli fatality of the conflict. Seven soldiers were wounded. The IDF said its troops had killed at least 17 fighters and captured 13, in addition to uncovering 13 tunnels. Within Gaza, the number of displaced people grew Friday to 40,000 from 22,000, and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency was operating 34 shelters, a spokesman said. The agency launched an appeal for $60 million to assist the displaced for a month and then provide provisions for the next six months, the spokesman said. Early Friday, artillery fire pounded Beit Hanoun in Gaza. The area was shrouded in smoke. A CNN crew near Sderot, Israel, spotted a substantial increase in armor and tanks on Friday. Hamas' military wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, planted a bomb that exploded in the path of an Israeli tank east of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, Al-Aqsa TV reported. Human shields and cease-fire . The IDF accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields, but when pressed on whether all killed Palestinian civilians were such shields, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said ""we are going to great lengths to try to minimize the civilian impacts."" ""I'm not saying there cannot be mistakes,"" which would be investigated, Lerner told CNN late Friday. Hamas senior official Ghazi Hamad was asked in a CNN interview on why the militants wouldn't agree to a cease-fire and whether their refusal would amount to a death sentence for many Palestinians in the face of Israel's superior military. ""Look, we have some demands. ... They should listen to us,"" Hamad said. ""We are not against this cease-fire. We want to live. We want to be also in a good situation."" Hamas leaders had rejected an earlier Egypt-backed cease-fire proposal, saying they had not been consulted on the deal and complaining that it did not address their broader demands, such as opening Gaza border crossings and freeing some Palestinian prisoners. Hamas' Al Qassam Brigades claimed that ""we are winning this battle with the grace of God and with the resolve of our people in Gaza,"" spokesman Abu Obadiah told Al-Aqsa TV. ""We are ready for a long, drawn-out battle with the enemy,"" he added. Outsize the battle zone, violent protests . The Israeli operation set off some protests around the world, including in Turkey, where violent demonstrations outside the Israeli Embassy prompted Israel's Foreign Ministry to send diplomats' families home and reduce staffing to a minimum. Turkish President Abdullah Gul said Friday that Israel is ""terrorizing the region"" and ""committing genocide."" ""I would like to pronounce one more time that the attacks that started last night have come to a very dangerous phase and I am warning Israel one more time, if they don't stop attacks on Gaza, the consequences might be heavier and the outcome will be massive,"" Gul said. In Jerusalem, police arrested 12 people Friday after what spokesman Micky Rosenfeld described on Twitter as ""masked Arab rioters"" threw stones at police officers on the Temple Mount, a disputed holy site. No injuries were reported, Rosenfeld said. United Nations face-off . Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour, permanent observer to the United Nations, accused Israel of choosing ""to continue waging war on our people,"" he told the U.N. Security Council in a statement Friday. ""This savage Israeli aggression cannot be justified by any means,"" he said. Israeli Ambassador Ron Prosor to the United Nations said his country ""did everything in our power to avoid"" the ground offensive. ""But Hamas rejected every overture to restore the quiet,"" Prosor said. Prosor cited how the UNRWA admitted Thursday it found 20 missiles in one of its schools in Gaza and suggested the missiles belonged to Hamas, which is using U.N. sites ""to commit a double war crime by targeting Israeli civilians while hiding behind Palestinians civilians,"" he said. 'Where are we supposed to go?' Al-Aqsa TV reported Friday that Israel had sent text messages to many Palestinians telling them of safe corridors to reach central Gaza. Before the incursion, the IDF dropped leaflets in 14 areas of Gaza, urging residents to temporarily leave their homes. ""The IDF is a moral army, and it does not aspire to harm even one single innocent person,"" Netanyahu said Friday. ""Not a single one. We are only operating against terrorist targets."" But many residents of Gaza have said they have nowhere to go in the small, impoverished strip of land. Border crossings with Israel and Egypt are closed. ""Since the Israelis started this 11 days ago, they have been telling us to leave. Where our we supposed to go -- to the Gaza Sheraton? Or take a hike in the forest?"" said Al Madhoun, the resident of northern Gaza. Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said Israeli bombs hit Wafa Hospital in Gaza while four patients were inside. Seventeen others had evacuated, he said. Some 300,000 of Gaza's approximately 1.8 million residents have been cut off from medical care because of Israeli military operations, Gaza Health Ministry spokesman Dr. Ashraf al-Qidra said Friday.

"Charlie Crist's fan isn't allowed on stage under the rules of an October 21 Florida governor's race debate that CNN is hosting in conjunction with Jacksonville affiliate WJXT. The candidates were sent a memo on October 8 outlining the format, rules and logistical information for the debate. Among those rules: No electronic devices. The memo stated: ""There will be no opening and closing statements, no notes, no props and no electronic devices will be allowed on stage. Candidates will be provided water, notepad and pen,"" a CNN spokesperson said Thursday. The CNN spokesperson said electronic devices range from a cell phone to a fan. Crist's decision to place a fan on stage during a separate debate Wednesday night triggered what the moderator described as ""the most unique beginning to any debate not only in Florida, but anywhere in the country."" Related: Fan delays Florida debate . Florida's Republican governor, Rick Scott, was seven minutes late walking onto the stage -- while moderators tried to explain during the live broadcast that he had decided not to participate because Crist had placed a small electronic fan under his own podium to keep cool. Almost immediately, ""#fangate"" was trending on Twitter. Crist, standing alone on stage, asked if the candidates were ""really going to debate about a fan."" Eventually, Scott walked onto the stage. His campaign said later that it was actually Crist who was in the midst of intense behind-the-scenes conversations with debate organizers over whether his fan would be allowed -- and that Scott was just waiting to see what happened. He hadn't realized that Crist had gone on stage. Scott said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" with Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had been waiting in a trailer for debate officials to tell him to head to the stage. ""They said he wasn't going to show up, that he was balking about his fan,"" Scott said, adding that he didn't care if Crist had a fan, a microwave or a humidifier. The organizers of the October 15 debate backed up Scott's version of events Thursday, saying Crist clearly broke the rules -- and ignored instructions given an hour before start time -- by having an aide place the fan on stage. Each campaign was sent a letter ahead of time explaining that ""candidates may not bring electronic devices (including fans), visual aids or notes to the debate,"" the two groups that hosted the debate Wednesday, Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association, said Thursday. Crist's campaign signed and returned that letter two days before the debate with a handwritten note appended saying the Democrat agreed to those rules, ""with understanding that the debate hosts will address any temperature issues with a fan if necessary."" Dean Ridings, the president of the Florida Press Association, got the note and told Crist's campaign that while organizers wanted all candidates to be comfortable, the auditorium at Broward College, where the debate was to be held, ""would be maintained at a comfortable temperature, and if there was a temperature problem, the partners would deal with it appropriately."" The stage was at 67 degrees at 6 p.m. Thursday, an hour before the debate. At 6:20 p.m., it was 66 degrees. But at some point in that 20-minute span, a Crist campaign aide placed the fan on stage -- ""and they were again told that no fans would be permitted,"" organizers said. ""In the minutes before airtime, the communication among the campaigns, the producing television station and the debate partners was chaotic and there undoubtedly was some confusion, but Gov. Scott never told Ridings or Wendy Walker, president, Leadership Florida, that he would not join the debate,"" the organizers said. ""Rather, the Scott campaign was waiting on resolution of the rules issue before Scott took the stage. The debate partners appreciate Gov. Scott's willingness to participate in the debate.""","Rules of an October 21 CNN / WJXT debate prohibit electronic devices, including fans.

"(CNN)The Houthi takeover of the Yemeni capital of Sanaa plunges the country into a yet darker chapter of its troubled modern history. An uneasy and sometimes violent standoff between Houthi fighters and forces loyal to President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi took on the appearance of a coup Tuesday, before a tentative power-sharing agreement was announced Wednesday, pulling the country back from the brink. But the deal is far from certain, with previous accords between the government and Houthi rebels having collapsed quickly. Hadi is now essentially powerless, as of Wednesday a prisoner inside his own home. As Yemen collapses into warring factions, and the United States surveys the wreckage with few good options, one party besides the Houthi seems set to benefit: al Qaeda. The Houthi are Shia from northern Yemen and make up about 30% of the population. They've been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade. At the beginning of 2014, they won a series of battles close to the Saudi border. And in September, Houthi fighters suddenly descended on Sanaa. They took over government buildings, the main airport and a share of power. Negotiations ensued, while Houthis seized other towns, cities and areas, including the port of Hodeida on the Red Sea. They continued to build up their presence in Sanaa, and two weeks ago held a huge rally to celebrate the Prophet Mohammed's birthday. One of the Houthis' slogans is daubed on walls in the capital: ""Death to America, Death to Israel, Damn the Jews, Victory to Islam."" Now, apparently unhappy with the shape of a draft constitution, they've gone for broke. The Houthis' power grab gave al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula the best recruiting sergeant they could hope for. Always virulently anti-Shia, AQAP was quick to proclaim itself as the defender of the Sunnis against the ""rafidah,"" a derogatory term meaning ""those who reject."" ""Do not leave a checkpoint for (the Houthis) that you do not strike, nor a headquarters that you do not bomb, nor a troop carrier that you do not explode,"" said one of AQAP's leaders, Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, in a video released last September, according to a translation by SITE Intelligence. AQAP's first response was a devastating suicide bombing of a Houthi rally in Sanaa, which killed nearly 50 people. It has stepped up attacks against the army and police, which it claims have been infiltrated by Houthi militia. Just last Sunday, it claimed responsibility for killing dozens of Houthis in sniper attacks, bombings and rocket attacks across the country. The authority of the government in Yemen has never been very strong, in a country of fierce tribal loyalties. Now as it collapses, Yemen may divide into areas controlled by the Houthis and areas controlled by others, with AQAP free to expand in remote southern and eastern provinces. Some tribes have already made common cause with AQAP in the face of the encroaching Houthi threat. Yemen is close to becoming a failing state; the sort of place where al Qaeda incubates quickly. Two years ago, AQAP fighters swept through southern Yemen, seizing a number of towns. It took government forces, aided by an aggressive U.S. drone campaign, months to eject them. Now, AQAP may be in a position to strike out again. U.S. officials say AQAP still poses the most active threat to the homeland and fear it is starting to share its bomb-making know-how with jihadists in Syria, specifically with the Khorasan Group, reputed to be an al Qaeda ""A team"" based in Syria. AQAP chief bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri has three times plotted to bring down U.S.-bound aircraft, coming closest to success on Christmas Day in 2009 when a Nigerian recruit attempted to blow up a bomb in his underwear in the skies above Detroit. Yemen's battle lines are now drawn on much starker Shia-Sunni sectarian lines, echoing recent developments in Syria and Iraq. But in all three countries, there is also a struggle for leadership of Sunni Muslims, between the jihadists like al Qaeda and ISIS and less extreme groups. In Yemen, the Muslim Brotherhood -- in the shape of the Al Islah Party -- is a powerful group well represented in the transitional government. It loathes the Houthi and has its own militias. The fighting in Yemen provides an opening to ISIS, which is keen to outflank al Qaeda and prove itself the true defender of the faith. In November, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called on Yemeni Sunnis to resist the Houthis. ""Oh soldiers of Yemen ... oh people of support and aid ... people of wisdom and faith ... be harsh against the Houthi rafidah, for they are kuffar apostates,"" he said in an audio message. ""Fight them and overcome them."" Some Yemeni jihadists, including former mid-level AQAP commander Ma'moun Hatem, have already declared their support for ISIS and al-Baghdadi. A fratricidal battle within the broader war for Yemen, the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, may become part of an ever-more chaotic scene. Yemeni officials have frequently accused Iran of providing financial support and weapons to the Houthis in an effort to control Yemen's Red Sea coast, on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. President Hadi himself alleged the Houthi were being trained and advised by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia. Saudi Arabia, which provides energy and financial support to Yemen and shares a long border with it, is looking on with growing anxiety, fearful of Shia-dominated states on both its eastern and western flanks. Inside Yemen, the Houthi appear to be getting help from forces still loyal to the former President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who clung to power until forced out by international pressure two years ago, handing the reins to Hadi, his longtime vice president. Saleh has never accepted retirement, despite serious injuries suffered in a bomb attack in 2011. And through an opportunistic alliance with the Houthis, he has clawed his way back onto the scene, infuriating Washington. In November, the U.S. government imposed sanctions on Saleh, saying ""he had reportedly become one of the primary supporters of violence perpetrated by individuals affiliated with the Huthi group."" ""More recently, as of September 2014, Saleh reportedly has been destabilizing Yemen by using others to undermine the central government and create enough instability to threaten a coup,"" the U.S. Treasury Department said. That threat has now been realized. Yemen may be poor, but it occupies strategic real estate alongside one of the world's most important shipping lanes. And much of that real estate is now ripe for exploitation by al Qaeda's most effective franchise, as it battles a group that looks for moral support, and maybe more, from Tehran.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Conan O'Brien's return to TV Monday night stuck close to the standard late night talk show format and set, but he could boast one innovation. ""I believe we're the first talk show that has a view of the ocean,"" O'Brien said. ""You can smell the salt air waft in."" O'Brien and announcer-sidekick Andy Richter demonstrated another new backdrop feature -- an over-sized moon they can move across the sky with a remote control. Exclusive: Watch Conan's opener . Otherwise, the one-hour TBS show has the desk, couch, sidekick, band and a guest promoting a movie familiar to late night audiences for decades. O'Brien's requisite opening monologue made it clear that ""getting fired"" jokes are to Conan what divorce jokes were for Johnny Carson. ""People ask me why I named the show 'Conan,'"" he said. ""I did it so I'd be harder to replace."" Another chief source of humor for the debut show was his move from the big budget NBC ""Tonight Show"" on a broadcast network to the frugal world of basic cable. ""I'm going to be honest,"" O'Brien said. ""It's not easy doing a late-night show on a channel without a lot of money and that viewers have trouble finding. So that's why I left NBC."" O'Brien parodied his NBC firing in a pre-produced opening segment that included cameos by actor Jon Hamm on the ""Mad Men"" set and CNN's Larry King as Conan's guardian angel. O'Brien wasted no time assuring Team CoCo fans that despite the change of channel, they would see his trademark onstage antics and characters, including the infamous X-rated bear. The first official guest was Arlene Wagner, curator of the Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum. She was chosen online in what O'Brien said was rigged voting. Wagner strolled across the stage and out the side door into a studio parking lot, slowing down only to give O'Brien a leprechaun nutcracker. Second guest Seth Rogen stayed for a while to talk about his upcoming ""Green Hornet"" movie. ""I'm so glad everyone more famous was busy,"" Rogen said. iReport: What did you think of Conan's debut? After interviewing ""Glee"" star Lea Michele, Conan strapped on a guitar to jam with music guest Jack White and the house band -- ""Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band."" The debut show ended with Conan promoting ""Lopez Tonight,"" which moved to midnight to make way for his 11 p.m. show. Janet Jackson was on with George Lopez Monday night. Conan O'Brien's Tuesday night guest will be Tom Hanks.","The new ""Conan"" show follows a format familiar to late night viewers .

"U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday that he's authorized ""targeted airstrikes"" in Iraq to protect American personnel and help Iraqi forces. ""We do whatever is necessary to protect our people,"" Obama said. ""We support our allies when they're in danger."" A key concern for U.S. officials: dozens of American consular staff and military advisers working with the Iraqi military in Irbil, the largest city in Iraq's Kurdish region. Obama said Thursday he'd directed the military to take targeted strikes against Islamist militants ""should they move towards the city."" Rapid developments on the ground, where a humanitarian crisis is emerging with minority groups facing possible slaughter by Sunni Muslim extremists, have set the stage for an increasingly dire situation. Thousands of families from the Yazidi minority are reportedly trapped in the mountains without food, water or medical care after fleeing the rampaging fighters of the Islamic State, also known as Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS. Throngs of refugees, many of them Iraqi Christians, are on the run -- their largest city, Qaraqosh, now occupied by fighters who gave them an ultimatum, ""Convert to Islam or die."" Obama also said he'd authorized targeted airstrikes ""if necessary"" to help Iraqi forces protect civilians trapped on the mountain. ""When we face a situation like we do on that mountain with innocent people facing the prospect of violence on a horrific scale, when we have a mandate to help, in this case a request from the Iraqi government, and when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America cannot turn a blind eye,"" Obama said. ""We can act, carefully and responsibly to prevent a potential act of genocide."" The potential escalation of U.S. military involvement comes two years after Obama ended the Iraq war and brought home American forces. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Thursday that there is no chance of ground troops heading back. Obama acknowledged that many Americans are concerned about military action in Iraq. ""As Commander in Chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq, so as we support Iraqis as they take the fight to these terrorists, American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq because there is no American military solution to the larger crisis in Iraq,"" Obama said. The President's announcement that he'd authorized airstrikes came after the United States airdropped meals and water in Iraq, sending humanitarian aid to trapped minority groups. ""The mission was conducted by a number of U.S. military aircraft under the direction of U.S. Central Command,"" a senior U.S. defense official said. ""The aircraft that dropped the humanitarian supplies have now safely exited the immediate airspace over the drop area."" Iraqi forces fight back as Islamists advance . The Iraqi air force bombed a number of targets Thursday night, Qubad Talabani, deputy prime minister of the Kurdish Regional Government, told CNN. The strikes killed at least two ISIS emirs, he said. Talabani also reported that U.S. officials said humanitarian airdrops would take place for the tens of thousands of Yazidis he estimates are stranded without food or water. The United States has been sharing intelligence through reconnaissance but are not involved in any airstrikes, a senior Iraqi military official told CNN on Thursday. The ISIS fighters, armed with armored vehicles and other military hardware taken from Iraqi forces in a lightning sweep through the north earlier this year, have overrun Iraq's largest Christian town and nearby villages. When radical Islamist fighters stormed the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar over the weekend, the Yazidi minority who call it home fled into the surrounding mountains in fear of their lives. Now, trapped without food, water or medical care in the summer heat, thousands are in desperate need of help. It's already too late to save dozens of children who've died of thirst. Other groups targeted by ISIS, which seeks to establish a Sunni caliphate stretching from Syria to Baghdad, include Shiite Muslim, Turkmen and Shabak -- all religious minorities. Fleeing people, some in cars and trucks and others on foot, got out with whatever possessions. The United Nations estimates 200,000 people heading toward Kurdistan in the past 48 hours. In a statement released Thursday night, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the situation a ""wake-up call."" ISIS, he said, is ""offering nothing to anyone except chaos, nihilism, and ruthless thuggery."" ""With a gut-wrenching humanitarian crisis unfolding, and the rolls of the starving and sick growing daily, there's not a minute to waste,"" Kerry said. ""The United States is acting and leading, and the world cannot sit by and watch innocents die."" After an emergency meeting on the situation Thursday, the United Nations Security Council issued a statement condemning the Islamists' attacks. ""The members of the Security Council reiterate that widespread or systematic attacks directed against any civilian populations because of their ethnic background, political grounds, religion or belief may constitute a crime against humanity, for which those responsible must be held accountable,"" the statement said . The council called on the international community to support Iraq ""and to do all it can to help alleviate the suffering of the population affected by the current conflict."" Kurdish region . Outside Irbil, the internal refugees were sleeping in parking lots or shells of buildings under construction with little access to water or any other services, CNN's Ivan Watson reported. Kurdish officials call for U.S. or NATO airstrikes to help them fight the ISIS forces. They also issued statements intended to boost morale of the Kurdish people, saying the Kurdish Pershmerga fighters would be able to hold off any serious threat to Irbil and other cities. A senior State Department official said the United States also was weighing opening a humanitarian corridor to provide support to Kurdish and Iraqi forces. Earnest, however, said while the United States would support Iraqi and Kurdish efforts, ""we can't solve these problems for them. These problems can only be solved with Iraqi political solutions."" The United States has 245 military personnel in Iraq, 90 of whom are advisers. The carrier USS George H.W. Bush and other Navy ships also are in the region. Sinjar unrest . Yazidis, among Iraq's smallest minorities, are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. Most of the 500,000 or so members live in and around Sinjar in northwestern Nineveh province, bordering Iraq's Kurdish region. The U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, said Tuesday that official reports indicated 40 children from the Yazidi minority had died ""as a direct consequence of violence, displacement and dehydration"" since the weekend. ""Families who fled the area are in immediate need of urgent assistance, including up to 25,000 children who are now stranded in mountains surrounding Sinjar and are in dire need of humanitarian aid including drinking water and sanitation services,"" it said.

"With the book ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" still flying off the shelves, women are discovering the power of sexual fantasy, some for the first time. According to neuroscientists Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam, authors of ""A Billion Wicked Thoughts,"" while men tend to have visually driven fantasies, women prefer to fantasize about what a man might do to them. For example, the top five female fantasies involve having sex with a stranger, being worshipped in bed, being ravaged in bed, being watched by others and enjoying a threesome. In other words, women tend to fantasize about being the object of desire. Erotica is wonderful, but you don't need a book to feel sexy. In fact, indulging in a little bit of fantasy on your own may be even more effective at spurring both sexual desire and arousal, according to a recent study. 4 ways to rev up your post-baby sex life . Researchers at the University of Michigan have shown that different forms of sexual fantasy may have a real impact on arousal and desire, particularly for women. For their study, published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, Katherine Goldey and Sari van Anders randomly assigned 128 women and 98 men to one of four groups, or ""arousal conditions."" One group completed an imagined social situation exercise in which they imagined a positive sexual encounter and then answered open-ended questions about it. The others engaged in typical unstructured fantasy (imagining sexual situations but not writing about them), while others read an erotic story of the researchers' choice or took part in a neutral exercise (writing about the room they were in). Then they rated their perceived genital arousal (how they felt physically), as well as their ""state"" desire (whether they wanted to have sex). The results: The first three groups all reported experiencing increased genital and psychological arousal, as well as higher ""state"" desire, compared with the neutral group. The group who engaged in unstructured fantasy had the greatest arousal. Interestingly, though, the researchers also measured ""trait"" desire -- sort of a person's general set point for sexual desire, once believed to be unchangeable -- and discovered that the imagined social situation exercise group, the ones imagining a positive sexual situation, reported significantly higher trait desire after that exercise. Sex or money: What makes you happier? That's great news for all of us, but particularly for women, who often tend to experience sexual desire in response to the sex they're already having. In other words, you may not feel quite so ""into"" sex in the beginning, but your desire and arousal grow as the interlude progresses. Indeed, female sexual response is typically characterized by ""responsive desire,"" while male sexual response is more likely characterized by ""spontaneous desire,"" says sex educator Emily Nagoski, author of the ""Good in Bed Guide to Female Orgasms."" ""'Responsive desire' is when motivation to have sex begins after sexual behavior has started: You're doing something else when your partner comes over and starts kissing you, and you think, 'Oh yeah! That's a good idea,'"" she explains. ""'Spontaneous"" desire, more typical of male sexuality, works more like this: You're walking down the street and for no immediately obvious reason you think, ""Hm. I'd like to have sex!"" As the new study suggests, actively fantasizing about sex isn't just a way to pass the time. It can create real changes in your body, moving you from thinking about sex in the abstract to fueling real desire and arousal. Fantasy is also a sign of a healthy sex life, and sharing those fantasies with your partner doesn't just have the potential to spice things up in the bedroom. It also means that you feel secure and confident in your relationship. It's often been said that the brain is our biggest sex organ, and this study only confirms that. So, give your brain a workout with a fantasy or two. You might be surprised where it leads you.

"Zine el Abidine Ben Ali will be remembered as the first leader to be toppled in what became known as the Arab Spring.  After nearly 24 years in power, he became the former president of Tunisia. Just over a year ago a young fruit seller in the city of Sidi Bouzid took the desperate step of setting himself on fire to protest the oppressive conditions inside his country. Despite a hospital visit by the then president, coupled with vows to cut prices of basic foods, end censorship and ensure police did not use live ammunition on protesters, Ben Ali failed to quell growing unrest. Mohamed Bouazizi succumbed to his injuries and his death triggered uprisings across Tunisia that spread through the Arab world, leading to regime change in Egypt and Libya. Nearly 250 people died during the Tunisian violence that led to Ben Ali's ouster. The 75-year-old fled with his wife Leila to Saudi Arabia, and attempts to return him for trial have so far proved fruitless. Other family members were reported to be in Canada. Ben Ali is facing a military tribunal in absentia, along with dozens of former senior officials, for his alleged role in the killing of protesters in January 2011. The former president and his wife already have been tried in absentia and sentenced to 35 years in prison for corruption. Although he has not appeared in court to defend himself, Ben Ali insists he is merely a ""scapegoat,"" unfairly portrayed and discredited by political opponents seeking to make a break with their country's past. In a statement released by his lawyer last June he said he was a victim of ""injustice"" and that he had always worked for what he thought was ""the good of the Tunisian people, improving living standards and progressing on the path to modernity."" But the Tunisian people chose a different path after more than two decades under single-party rule. The French and U.S.-educated Ben Ali trained as a soldier and later became head of the defense ministry's intelligence section -- a connection that analysts believe helped him maintain a grip on power during his presidency. After serving as ambassador to Poland and ashort-lived appointment as prime minister, he became president in a 1987 bloodless coup, replacing Habib Bourguiba, who was declared medically unfit. Ben Ali was returned to office in five elections -- in 1989, 1994, 1999, 2004 and 2009 -- often with claims of more than 90% voter support. However, his years in power were marked by allegations of corruption and repression. Shortly after Ben Ali's overthrow, Tunisian Ben Salah told CNN: ""You didn't want to be overheard saying something against Ben Ali. Fear left with Ben Ali, May he and that fear never come back."" Dr Claire Spencer, who heads the Middle East and North Africa Program at London-based think-tank Chatham House, said the former president used his intelligence background to clamp down on the freedom of speech. ""It was more of a police state,"" she said. ""There was a great atmosphere of distrust. ""Liberalization of the economy started as a good idea but it deviated from benefiting the rest of the population. His inner circle was top slicing any company that was making a profit."" Such corruption and high unemployment are two factors that are thought to have pushed Mohamed Bouazizi to self-immolation. Dr Spencer believes that in the end, Ben Ali became a victim of his own political blindness. ""He looked like someone who believed his own myth and to be out of touch with what was happening in Tunisia.""","Ben Ali is facing a tribunal in absentia for his alleged role in the killing of protesters .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- A suicide bomber killed at least six people in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri on Monday, while Boko Haram militants attacked the town of Damaturu to the west but were driven out after a 10-hour battle. The sector commander for Maiduguri's civilian task force told CNN a female bomber had carried out the attack on the city's market at 11:00 a.m. At least six people had died and the toll was expected to rise, Cmdr. â€ŽAbba Aji Kalli said. More than 20 people had been taken to hospitals, many in critical condition, he said. Police gave a slightly different account, saying two female bombers had targeted the main gate of the market, killing five. A source at the Maiduguri General Hospital said 48 injured had been taken to the hospital from the scene of the attack. Last week, another suicide attack in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, killed at least 78 people. Meanwhile, battle sounds roared in Damaturu in neighboring Yobe state early Monday as Islamist Boko Haram fighters poured in, an eyewitness said. ""I was in bed around 4:40 a.m., when I was jolted out of sleep with huge explosions and sounds of gunfire,"" said resident Buka Girema. Girema fled with his family into nearby brush land. Neighbors have fled their homes as well, he said. ""After some phone calls, I realized Boko Haram gunmen were on the attack. They came in several trucks and vans,"" he said. They set fire to a police checkpoint, he said. Militants pushed toward the center of town, and the sound of gunfire spread to compounds that house government workers, residents said. A nurse working in the town spoke to CNN by telephone as gunshots rang out in the background. She said she was hiding in her home, and then concluded quietly, ""They have entered my house. Please pray for me,"" before hanging up the phone. 'Heinous and barbaric' The attack on Damaturu ended in midafternoon. Yobe state spokesman Mohammed Hassan said the Boko Haram fighters were forced out of the town. ""The insurgents were not able to come in full force. They were not able to operate as they wanted. The authorities pushed them out. Many civilians also helped,"" Hassan said. Yobe Gov. Ibrahim Gaidam condemned the attack on Damaturu as ""heinous and barbaric"" and praised security forces for their efforts repelling the militants. ""His Excellency the governor has also been told that the security effort is still ongoing. Security agents will continue to track and pursue any remnants of the attackers who might still be hiding in town. ""The governor urges people in Damaturu and all across our State to continue to remain vigilant and pray to Almighty Allah for His intervention,"" state spokesman Abdullahi Bego said in a statement. Campaign of violence . Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians and bombing government buildings. On Friday, two suicide bombers and gunmen attacked a Muslim congregation during prayers in the central mosque in northern Nigeria's largest city, Kano, officials said. A third bomb exploded outside the mosque. Officials said more than 100 people were killed in the attack. It came two weeks after the emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, one of Nigeria's most influential monarchs, called for self-defense, urging people to procure arms and fight Boko Haramâ€Ž, which has a significant presence in the area. The emir made the call at the same mosque where Friday's attack occurred. In April, Boko Haram militants drew international condemnation when they kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls, many of whom they later said they sold into slavery. At least 5,000 people have died at Boko Haram's hands, according to a U.S. Congressional Research Service report, making it one of the world's deadliest terrorist organizations. Journalists Aminu Abubakar and Hassan John reported from Nigeria; CNN's Ben Brumfield wrote and reported from Atlanta.

"Editor's Note: Timothy Shriver, the chairman of Special Olympics for the past 11 years, co-produced the 1997 DreamWorks Studios movie ""Amistad."" His mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the sister of Sen. Ted Kennedy, founded Special Olympics and his father, Sargent Shriver, served as president. Tim's sister Maria, the wife of California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, is a Special Olympics board member. For another view, read here. Timothy Shriver says ""Tropic Thunder"" perpetuates the worst stereotypes of intellectually disabled people. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- I am so proud of everyone who turned out to Monday's premiere of the film ""Tropic Thunder"" to protest its unfortunate and humiliating portrayal of people with intellectual disabilities. Prior to the premiere, I joined a large coalition of individuals and organizations to engage in discussions with DreamWorks Studios CEO Stacey Snider and others from the studio to express our concern over the film's ""Simple Jack"" subplot and the slogans, ""Once upon a time there was a retard,"" and ""Never go full retard."" Members of the Coalition of National Disability Organizations -- disabled advocates and family members of people with intellectual disabilities -- have seen the movie and reported shock and disgust. Their reactions have resonated with many of us who take their cause and their voice with the utmost seriousness. While I am disappointed that we were not consulted in the same manner as other minority groups depicted in the film and that there are 17 mentions of the ""R-word"" with one mention of the ""N-word,"" I am grateful to Ms. Snider for listening to the coalition and for taking steps to eliminate some of the film's most offensive marketing elements. I am also appreciative of her commitment to working in the future for an end to denigrating speech and hurtful portrayals of people with intellectual disabilities in film and in society. DreamWorks and its leaders have a powerful reputation for advancing socially and politically important issues. In particular, Steven Spielberg has been a generous supporter of the work of Special Olympics, for which I am deeply grateful. I look forward to counting the hopes and dreams of 200 million people with intellectual disabilities among the causes of this formidable group of creative and artistic leaders. Now, however, is the time to raise our voices against ""Tropic Thunder"" and the harm it is sure to visit on people with intellectual disabilities. Together with the members of the international coalition, I am asking Steven Spielberg, Stacey Snider, Ben Stiller and the entire ""Tropic Thunder"" team to stop showing the film, and asking movie theaters and moviegoers to shut this movie out. ""Tropic Thunder"" is a colossal blunder. Don't show or see ""Tropic Thunder."" The degrading use of the word ""retard"" together with the broader humiliation of people with intellectual disabilities in the film goes way too far. When the R-word is casually bandied about and when bumbling, clueless caricatures designed to mimic the behavior of people with intellectual disabilities are on screen, they have an unmistakable outcome: They mock, directly or indirectly, people with intellectual disabilities. They perpetuate the worst stereotypes. They further exclusion and isolation. They are simply mean. Mockery in any form, or for any purpose or directed at anyone, especially those least able to defend themselves, is neither funny nor acceptable. We must work together to bring it to an end. As chairman of the Special Olympics, I am inspired to be as vocal as possible about this important matter to effect positive change and to generate support for those who deserve our respect. Name-calling is a subtle but malicious practice that only serves to perpetuate stigma, fear, intolerance and more. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on 'Tropic Thunder' Ridicule is a subtle but malicious practice that only serves to exclude and marginalize people with intellectual disabilities. Stop ""Tropic Thunder."" People with intellectual disabilities can be great athletes, productive employees, positive friends, courageous role models. Let's open our schools, doctors offices, businesses, communities, and most importantly, our hearts to the giftedness of every human being. No more exceptions. No more exclusion. Some may think we ought to lighten up and not get so worked up because this is, after all, just a film. But films become part of pop culture and character lines are repeated in other settings time and time again.

"For the most part, train terminals are desperate places. They're an unavoidable evil linking us to somewhere else -- but not before assaulting us with tepid coffee, drafty waiting rooms and smelly, ugly ticket halls. Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal, which turns 100 this month, is a glorious exception. But it's not just its iconic opal-faced clock (a century old and valued at more than $10 million), flawless marble staircases (modeled on those in the Paris Opera House) and gleaming chandeliers (fitted with 35,000 custom-designed, low-energy light bulbs) that lend Grand Central a sense of golden age grandeur. The terminal -- not station, never station -- also has a fascinating history, with stories to rival Manhattan's better known, pointier landmarks. Listen: Grand Central's 100th birthday . 1913: Grand opening . While trains had been running in and out of Manhattan since 1871, it wasn't until the completion of Grand Central Terminal in 1913 that New York had itself a world renowned transportation icon. The Vanderbilt family constructed the 48-acre site (the little polished brass acorns adorning every clock and light fixture reflect the family symbol), inadvertently triggering a 20-year Midtown construction boom that added the likes of the Helmsley and Chrysler Buildings to the city's skyline. If it weren't for Grand Central, all those 1990s disaster movies would have looked very different. 1942: A president rolls in . At 200 feet, Grand Central boasts the deepest basement in New York City. This is where some of the terminal's shadiest secrets are concealed. Among them is a hidden platform connecting a presidential getaway train to an area beneath the Waldorf Astoria hotel. The secret platform was constructed for Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II. The polio-suffering president's armored carriage was specifically designed to limit lateral movement, allowing him to travel while keeping his disability secret from the American public. So why is it still a rusty relic beneath Grand Central, rather than a museum showpiece? Simple: It weighs 142 metric tons -- you try moving it. 1944: Winning the war . Another of the terminal's great subterranean secrets is M42 -- a hidden basement and the deepest accessible underground point in Manhattan. Not that you'll ever go there -- the existence of the area was officially denied by the building's owners until the late 1980s and it doesn't even appear on the original blueprints. So what's the big secret? The room -- named after Grand Central's 42nd Street location -- houses a series of rotary converters, which, back in the 1930s, provided the power that electrified the terminal's 63 tracks. During World War II, these tracks linked thousands of shaven grunts and other instruments of war to the ports that would ship them out to the front lines. Despite Grand Central's strategic significance, however, a bucket of sand tipped into one of these converters would have been enough to bring the terminal -- and 80% of the country's eastbound military movement -- to a standstill. This vulnerability was nearly exploited by a pair of Nazi saboteurs in November 1944, but their plot was scuppered by an FBI manhunt. Commuters join celebrities for Grand Central's 100th birthday . 1957: To infinity (but not much further) A small hole in the ceiling of the main concourse, just near the constellation of Pisces, is an unlikely legacy of the space race. The hole was left behind after a Redstone rocket was hoisted up inside the terminal in an attempt to get the U.S. public excited about space exploration. So eager was the government to counteract anxiety around the Russian Sputnik launch, that it forgot to check whether the rocket would fit in the building. 1968: Demolition looms . By the late 1960s, the growing popularity of interstate highways and air travel had taken a toll on the country's railroads, leaving Grand Central a stinking, hobo-infested eyesore. It was condemned to be demolished until the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission stepped in to declare the building a historic landmark. Grand Central was saved, but there was still the problem of what to do with the guys and gals using the Beaux Arts masterpiece as their own personal living quarters and latrine. Rather than force out the homeless, city officials addressed each and every member of Grand Central's homeless community on a case-by-case basis. The vast majority ended up in permanent housing. 1990: A green role model . While these days you'll do well to walk more than half a Manhattan block without tripping over some sort of green waste initiative, back in the early 1990s, Manhattan was chugging out as much CO2 as everyone else. Setting an example for contemporary recycling programs, Grand Central overnight became the biggest recycling plant in the United States when it introduced newspaper bins in 1990, collecting five tons of waste in its first day. However, not everyone loved the scheme. When The New York Times noticed the introduction of the bins coincided with a hefty dent in sales (thanks to commuters salvaging dumped papers rather than buying their own), they reacted swiftly. Since 2001, they've been paying a significant fee each year to maintain craftily designed bins that prevent people from removing discarded papers. 1998: A lick of paint . Grand Central's mid-1990s makeover took 12 years to complete. During this time everything from light bulbs to the gigantic ceiling skyscape were painstakingly scraped, scrubbed and polished back to their prewar glory. But what do you do when the quarries from which you procured your original marble have closed? Order them to be reopened, of course, and, while you're at it, pull masonry technicians out of retirement to make sure everything is properly prepared and fitted. This goes some way to explaining why the whole restoration project cost more than $160 million. 2000s: Top of the shops . Of the 700,000 people who pass through Grand Central every day, an estimated 10,000 don't have a ticket. They're not fare dodgers, they're shoppers, who together shell out $150 million every year on lattes, oyster dinners, MacBooks and more. The terminal houses 50 shops, 20 casual eateries and five restaurants and cocktail lounges. In terms of spend per square foot, that makes the terminal the most commercially successful shopping center in the United States. 2008: A viral hit . Grand Central has been immortalized in scores of Hollywood movies -- credits include ""North By Northwest,"" ""Serpico,"" ""The Untouchables"" and, um, ""Little Nicky"" -- but by far its most memorable theatrical moment came when drama collective ImprovEverywhere scared rush hour commuters with this incredible stunt. More than 200 of the group's ""agents"" froze perfectly still, in unison, for five minutes, giving everyone else the impression that they'd just stumbled upon some cataclysmic rift in the space-time continuum. The result? More YouTube views than Keyboard Cat. 2012: Storm savior . While its 100-year history has seen it take on the role of everything from government propaganda auditorium to glitzy shopping mall, Grand Central remains a transportation hub, and an efficient one. Just as it did on 9/11 -- when, despite all other transport networks shutting down, it had the city evacuated by 2 p.m. -- Grand Central played a key role in getting New Yorkers to safety ahead of October's superstorm Sandy. Very rarely has the terminal's marble concourse looked as cavernous as it did when the last Metro-North Railroad train fled to higher ground -- probably not since the Vanderbilts declared Grand Central open almost 100 years previously, in fact. iReport: Photos from the centennial celebration . 2013: 100 up . On February 1, 2013, this grand dame of the railway world celebrates its 100th birthday. A brass band will play on the main concourse, actors, poets and celebrities will swan around and shops and restaurants will adopt a 1913 pricing strategy -- including 6 cents for a loaf of rye bread from Zaro's Bakery and $2 for silk scarves from Toto.

"She didn't have enough power to maneuver and effectively trade artillery rounds with enemy vessels in the swift Savannah River. Instead, the locally produced CSS Georgia, a one-of-a-kind ironclad produced for the Confederacy during the Civil War, became a stationary floating battery, bristling with artillery pieces. She did her job. The Yankees, intent on taking Savannah, Georgia, refused to take on the CSS Georgia or other nearby defense obstructions. The CSS Georgia won the battle, but lost the war: The vessel was scuttled in December 1864 shortly before Union forces took Savannah and presented the city to President Abraham Lincoln as a Christmas present. The shipwreck has rested in the murky river since, rarely disturbed and having weathered the indignity of being hit during dredging a couple of times over the years. Ironclad Civil War sailors laid to rest 150 years later . This week, U.S. Navy divers, working with archaeologists for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, retrieved a 64-square-foot section of the ironclad, a precursor to the long-anticipated removal and preservation of the shipwreck so the city's vital shipping channel can be deepened. The Corps expects to spend an estimated $9.5 million on the project. The removal is expected to begin in summer 2014, although funding has not been finalized. ""Over time the ship's casemate, the iron-covered upper portion of the warship, came apart,"" the Corps' Savannah District said in a statement Wednesday. ""The small portion removed Tuesday will give archaeologists the ability to assess the condition of the remainder of the ship."" Shipwreck found on Gulf floor while thousands watched . That remainder includes remaining cannon, pieces of the ship's power plant and propeller shaft and two chunks of the casemate. Officials are excited because the recovery of the casemates -- the compartments where artillery pieces were housed -- is believed to be the first of a Confederate ironclad. One of the surviving casemates is huge: 68 feet by 24 feet. Full moon gets partial blame for Civil War general's death . Divers, who have only a few feet of visibility, have been assessing the CSS Georgia wreck, so they know what they will be facing next summer. The site is adjacent to Old Fort Jackson and the main shipping channel. ""This is just a small section. It was not cut off,"" Corps public affairs specialist Sandra Hudson said of the piece recovered Tuesday. ""It was a small piece they found that would be the most viable to pull up."" Archaeologists have the challenge of preserving the CSS Georgia through chemical and other means, making her iron stable so that the remains one day can be displayed in museums. This 5,000-pound chunk of casemate, lifted by crane onto a barge, is being sent to Texas A&M University for archaeological testing, Hudson said. Civil War heirlooms bond families with past . The remains of the CSS Georgia may answer some mysteries, including its dimensions and the manner of construction. The casemates were made of railroad iron. The vessel could handle 10 guns, though fewer were onboard when it was destroyed. There are no known blueprints for the ironclad, which was produced in Savannah in 1862 as part of a defensive naval squadron. Its wreckage straddles the borders of Georgia and South Carolina. According to the Corps, Savannah's harbor will be deepened from 42 feet to 47 feet, ""greatly expanding its capability to handle larger cargo vessels."" The ongoing expansion of the Panama Canal means bigger ships will need deeper water at ports around the United States. If things go as planned, the remains of the CSS Georgia and associated artifacts will be on the surface before the 150th anniversary of its sinking. 12 fascinating Civil War sites .","The CSS Georgia never fired a shot in anger during the Civil War .

"Thanks to hard-drinking, hardworking Don Draper, we've traveled through the '60s in style. Now let's take a look at the ad man's New York. ""Mad Men,"" the AMC series that Rolling Stone called ""the greatest TV drama of all time,"" is back for a new season on Sunday. And though it's filmed primarily in Los Angeles, the show is set in New York, and notable locations across the city turn up in the script as liberally as a heap of pastrami on rye. In preparation for the season six premiere, we offer you this guide to the NYC haunts of ad exec Draper and his endlessly entertaining cohorts at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. 'Mad Men' and the other 1960s . EAT . On an episode titled ""Red in the Face,"" bosses-on-the-loose Draper and Roger Sterling spend their lunch -- and expense accounts -- taking full advantage of the eats and drinks at the venerable Grand Central Oyster Bar & Restaurant, some of which later embarrassingly ended up on the carpet at the feet of a group of potential clients. Hopefully you'll have more restraint when you visit this 100-year-old seafood establishment on the lower level of Grand Central Station, where tourists mingle with commuters over martinis and platters of freshly shucked oysters and other fishy delights. 89 E. 42nd St., www.oysterbarny.com . Another celebration featuring our Mad Men stars, this time Draper and the lusty wife of an insult comic, took place at legendary restaurant Sardi's. Even the framed celebrity caricatures on its walls were re-created for the scene. Located in the heart of the Theater District, Sardi's has been a favorite with the Broadway crowd for more than 85 years (the Tony Awards were thought up here), and you'll feel like a star just for having eaten here. 234 W. 44th St., www.sardis.com . 10 trips that can change your child's life . DRINK . The Roosevelt Hotel has been featured in a couple of ""Mad Men"" scenes, including one in which Draper retreats here after being kicked out of the house by his wife, Betty. A stay at this landmark hotel will have you feeling like a part of the show, especially since its decor gives it the appearance of an elaborate ""Mad Men"" set piece, but the place to really connect with the show is just past the lobby in the Madison Club Lounge. On April 7, to coincide with the season premiere, the lounge will host a viewing party with complimentary whiskey tastings and a ""Best 'Mad Men' Attire"" contest. The festivities will continue with themed cocktails and an invitation for patrons to dress in their '60s best each Sunday the show airs. 45 E. 45th St., www.theroosevelthotel.com . Remember Peggy and her colleagues doing the Twist at a local watering hole after she nailed the Belle Jolie presentation in season one? The site was P.J. Clarke's, one of the oldest bars in New York. Truly a Big Apple institution and a popular hangout among ad execs in the 1960s, P.J. Clarke's was once described by one of its beloved barmen as ""the Vatican of saloons."" 915 Third Ave., www.pjclarkes.com . Mad men, mad 'dos: What the late '60s really looked like . STAY . When Draper and friends started their own agency at the end of season three, they set up shop, at least temporarily, in a suite at the Pierre hotel. The fabled lodging, which overlooks Central Park, was renovated and modernized a few years back, so your room might not ooze nostalgia. But if you close your eyes tight enough, you might just be able to imagine Joan typing away in the corner or Pete squawking on the phone with a client. 2 E. 61st St., www.tajhotels.com/pierre . Given that the Hotel Elysée in Midtown Manhattan is the scene of a lunchtime tryst between copywriter Peggy and a fellow named Duck from a rival agency, it's only appropriate that the prestigious property is offering a special ""Mad Men"" package for fans of the show. It includes accommodations in one of its luxurious suites, which will be stocked with a dozen roses, strawberries and a box of chocolates, as well as two free cocktails either at the Monkey Bar or brought to your room.

"A year since a tornado destroyed a third of Joplin, Missouri, three iReporters revisit the scenes of destruction they witnessed in May 2011 and reflect on the recovery process. Jennifer Parr had heard the sirens and knew the tornado was coming. The college student barely made it out of town to her parents' house before the storm touched down that Sunday. She returned the next day to document the wreckage. ""My house is still standing, but all the windows are busted out, and my belongings have been strewn all over the house. The fencing around my yard is destroyed,"" she told iReport. ""My house is located in southwest Joplin, three blocks away from the hospital that took a direct hit and three blocks away from houses that were completely leveled. It's just unreal."" May 23, 2011: Jennifer Parr talks about the deadly tornado that hit Joplin, Missouri . After spending the past year living with her parents and grandfather, she and her dog will move into a new place next month. Last year, she couldn't imagine how the town would recover. Today, she says, Joplin set a standard for disaster recovery. ""The business district looks like almost as if nothing had ever happened there. It's been really amazing how fast some of the recovery has happened,"" she said. ""It gives you hope for the future."" Spirit of Joplin . Grant Deardorff was at home with his pregnant wife and year-old son just north of Joplin, hoping the predicted tornado wouldn't strike. After they knew they were safe, ""I just had a feeling I need to go to town and bring my camera and either be prepared to take pictures or help people,"" he told iReport at the time. Deardorff, a community manager for the American Cancer Society, spent the first weeks after the tornado helping remove debris and assisting friends. On nights and weekends throughout the summer, he documented the aftermath in photos, piecing together the magnitude of what had happened. And then, for a long time, he didn't want to look anymore. ""Quickly, it became a little too much for me emotionally,"" he said. ""After I was done taking the pictures, I didn't want to think about them for a while. There was so much pain and loss."" Then and now: Grant Deardorff's photos from the tornado aftermath . By March, as he saw victims rebuilding and looking forward, he felt ready to revisit the area as a photographer. He compiled photos and stories from the Joplin tornado in a digital book called ""The Heart of Joplin."" He plans to donate $5 from the sale of each book to two Joplin nonprofits. Deardorff said the images of the aftermath ""remind us of how much work Joplin has done to rebuild itself over the past year and how the spirit of Joplin overcame such a terrible disaster."" Hard to go back to work . Zachary Tusinger watched the tornado move in from the roof of his apartment building. A few hours later, he learned that his aunt and uncle were killed. Many friends were without homes. It was hard for the young attorney to go back to work after that. Sitting behind a desk just didn't feel right, he said. Within a few months, Tusinger switched jobs to work exclusively with tornado victims as an Equal Justice Works AmeriCorps legal fellow with Legal Aid of Western Missouri. As much as the town has recovered, the tornado still comes up in nearly every conversation. ""Even though we're a year out, we're still only a year out. There's still a lot of shadows or remnants of what happened that day,"" he said on the anniversary of the tornado. ""It's very hard to go through the day without thinking of the tornado or seeing some sign of the tornado or talking to someone that was affected by the tornado.""","iReporters revisit the scenes of Joplin destruction .

"Frugal, cold and boring -- those are just some of the words Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel has been called by her peers and the global press days before the German election. So how did a quiet, unassuming fraulein from a small, rural town in the former communist-ruled German Democratic Republic (GDR) become arguably the most powerful female politician of all time? While the constant chatter of fixing the Eurozone has recently abated, the Christian Democratic Union leader was a popular choice for another term with strong approval ratings thanks to securing the country's lowest unemployment rate in two decades. Upon completion of her recently won third term as chancellor, by 2016 she will become the longest-serving elected female head of government in history. The original ""Iron Lady"" Margaret Thatcher, who served Britain for 11 years as prime minister, currently holds this record. Merkel's rise from political obscurity to the highest publicly elected office in Germany is a captivating tale. Born in West Germany, her father Horst Kasner, a Lutheran pastor moved the family in 1957 to the small town of Templin in East Germany shortly before the erection of the Berlin Wall. Humble beginnings . Growing up under communist rule in East Germany would have had a strong impact on the future chancellor. While she has often said she was never interested in the politics of the new state, her world view was shaped by her surroundings. The restrictions and ever-present secret police -- the Stasi -- taught Merkel the importance of discretion and when to speak up. Through her childhood, Merkel was strong academically and teachers praised her skills in math and language, but it was the sciences that caught her attention. In turn, she went on to study physics at the University of Leipzig. The characteristics that come from being a scientist have become one of her defining skills as a politician. As Stefan Kornelius writes in Merkel's authorized biography, ""Angela Merkel -- The Chancellor and Her World"": ""Merkel shapes her world view in an analytical way. She weighs up arguments, industriously collects facts, considers the pros and cons ... ""She admires people with qualities that are not her own, but prefers to work her way steadily forward. Herein lies Merkel's problem: if her opponent doesn't use rational arguments, then the logical framework ceases to function, arguments cannot be weighted against each other and compromises cannot be reached."" Deja vu? Upon leaving university and earning her PhD, Merkel initially worked as a quantum chemist at the Academy of Sciences in East Berlin before joining the a small independent party, Democatic Awakening shortly before reunification between East and West Germany. She swiftly rose through the ranks of the party, which quickly aligned with then-chancellor of West Germany Helmut Kolhl. By the time the Berlin Wall fell in October of 1990, Merkel was working as deputy press secretary to the East German premier. In the following months, she watched diplomacy in action and the rapid financial collapse of East Germany after reunification. Put simply, this experience shaped her economic world view forever. ""Look, I've experienced the collapse of a country, the GDR,"" she said in April at an event with the Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk. ""The economic system failed under the aegis of the Soviet Union. ""What I really don't want is to look on, eyes open, as Europe as a whole slips back. I would find that absurd, we have all the skills in our hands."" Unafraid to say 'nein' Viewed as the de facto leader of Europe, Merkel's legacy will largely be determined by the outcome of the euro crisis. Thrust into the center of Europe's ailing economic landscape, she has taken a hard line with neighboring countries and world leaders. ""In the debt crisis, Merkel is seen as the hard-bitten, humorless, austerity-enforcing ""Madame Non"" who refuses to underwrite the rest of the euro area's debt,"" writes journalists Alan Crawford and Tony Czuczka in their recent book, Angela Merkel: A Chancellorship Forged in Crisis. Bringing her own brand of Germany's social market economy to the world stage with her divisive austerity measures, Merkel operates a step-by-step approach to her politics. As Crawford and Czuczka write: ""... Merkel consults widely to better formulate her approach to policy making. She is not given to snap, intuitive decisions, but is rather very deliberate in the way she reaches her conclusions."" But what also makes Merkel most unusual is how little her lifestyle has changed since assuming power. In contrast to fellow politicians, she lives a modest way of life residing in her Berlin apartment with her second husband Joachim Sauerspends. What's more, she doesn't put on lavish displays when hosting world leaders and she continues to spend weekends away from public glare at her home in the rural hamlet of Hohenwalde, east of Berlin. Though she is often described as ""boring"" and has been known to give long press conferences without revealing anything of news value, her understated political persona is her strength. In an age where pomp and performance can seem to trump policy and substance, Merkel is the exception to the rule. Her shrewd negotiation skills and ability to deliver make up for what she lacks in charm and charisma. After all, sometimes the ability for a leader to govern is more important than the ability to warm a crowd.","Merkel wins third term as German Chancellor after elections on Sunday .

"It used to be a long shot, but now ... is there a word for insanely more unlikely than a long shot? The Mega Millions jumped to $425 million Friday, according to Charles Strutt, executive director of the Multi-State Lottery Association. It rolled over for the 20th time after no winner was picked in Tuesday's drawing. The beefy payout likely has a Pavlovian effect on regular lottery players, but anyone with a modicum of math proficiency knows he might as well set fire to that $1 bill as spend it on a ticket. Your odds of getting all six numbers correct for the second-largest Mega Millions jackpot are about 1 in 259 million, according to the lottery company.

The latest probability is up from the old odds, which were about 1 in 175 million. Of course, you'd probably have a hard time telling this to the trio from Illinois, Kansas and Maryland who split the record $656 million kitty last year. It's worth mentioning that you have a one-in-15 chance of winning something, even if it's just getting your dollar back, while the odds of winning the second-place $1 million prize (that is, matching five balls but not the megaball) are about 1 in 18.5 million. Those numbers are hard for the average person to fathom, so maybe it's easier if we provide you a list of things that are way more likely than collecting a Mega Millions jackpot.

"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (CNN) -- At age 19, Yohannes Gebregeorgis borrowed a soft-cover romance novel entitled ""Love Kitten"" that changed his life forever. ""I just wanted to come back to Ethiopia and help children have a future, have hope,"" Yohannes Gebregeorgis says. Born in rural Ethiopia to an illiterate cattle merchant who insisted upon his son's education, Gebregeorgis had seen a few books in school. But it was the experience of having a book of his own that sparked a lifelong commitment. Today, at 56, Gebregeorgis is establishing libraries and literacy programs to connect Ethiopian children with books. ""Most Ethiopian children have only access to textbooks in the classroom,"" says Gebregeorgis. ""Books children read outside of school, those are the spices of education."" It wasn't until he became a children's librarian in the United States that he realized what the children of his native home were missing. Forced to flee Ethiopia to the United States as a political refugee in 1981, Gebregeorgis ultimately put himself through university, obtaining a graduate degree in library science. He relocated to the Bay Area, taking a post at the San Francisco Children's Library in 1985. There, he met ""The Little Engine That Could,"" ""Captain Ahab"" and ""Peter Pan."" He realized the impact children's books could make on a child's sense of wonder and vision. ""Children could imagine everything from books -- connections to other cultures, to other people, to other children, and to the universe at large,"" recalls Gebregeorgis. ""It gives them hope. It gives them pleasure. It gives them everything that they cannot otherwise get in regular textbooks."" But Gebregeorgis found that, among the brilliantly illustrated books in 70 languages, there were none in Amharic, the primary language of Ethiopia, and none representing the places and characters of Ethiopian lore. When the library allocated $1,200 for the purchase of Ethiopian books the following year, Gebregeorgis was unable to find any, because of prohibitive publishing, purchasing and importing costs in his home country. So he wrote one. ""Silly Mammo"" was the first bilingual Amharic-English children's book, and it led Gebregeorgis to establish Ethiopia Reads in 1988. Using proceeds from book sales and grassroots book-a-thons, the nonprofit financed his efforts to bring children's libraries to Ethiopia. In 2002, Gebregeorgis left his job and his home and returned to Ethiopia with 15,000 books donated by the San Francisco Children's Library. With them, he opened the Shola Children's Library on the first floor of his Addis Ababa home.  Watch Gebregeorgis explain how his home became more than just a children's library » .

"(CNN) -- This World Cup is no protector of reputations. Nor is it anything other than steadfast in its refusal to reveal any clear favorite to hoist the 20th incarnation of football's prime feast. Argentina certainly counts as one of a pool of nations capable of capturing glory, but its performances so far have shown a worrying brittleness. Still, it just keeps on winning and can now look forward to a last eight clash with either the United States or Belgium. The latest side to come close to toppling La Albiceleste was Switzerland, but just like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iran and Nigeria before them, one moment of magic was all that separated the two in Tuesday's penultimate last-16 clash. With the contest a matter of seconds away from penalties, the decisive blow was conjured between two men who operate at opposite ends of Spain's fiercest rivalry. Lionel Messi, of Barcelona, drove deep into Swiss territory and swept the ball wide for Real Madrid's Angel Di Maria, who stroked confidently into the corner. Yet there was still more agony for Switzerland to endure. With even its goalkeeper playing as a striker, a point-blank header from Blerim Dzemaili crashed against the post before squirming wide in the 122nd minute. Argentina's fevered reaction upon the final whistle underscored a palpable sense of relief that its bandwagon continues to edge closer to a first triumph since 1986. ""I was nervous towards the end because we couldn't score and any mistake could have knocked us out,"" Argentina captain Messi told a press conference. ""The minutes were passing by and we didn't want the match to go to penalties. We were suffering, but we had a special play, I passed to Angel and now we can celebrate."" With Switzerland keen to limit any slice of space for Argentina's array of attacking talent to operate in, the opening stages of the game in Sao Paulo were predictably tight. There was a glimpse of goal for Messi a little under the quarter hour mark but his stabbed cross-shot was pocketed by Swiss goalkeeper Diego Benaglio. Once the contest had settled into a pattern, Argentina's failure to engage an powerful offensive arsenal afforded Switzerland a growing confidence which reflected in its play. The game's first gilt-edged opening arrived on 28 minutes, and it was one carved out by two players who operate in Germany's Bundesliga. Bayern Munich star Xherdan Shaqiri found midfielder Granit Xhaka, who plays for Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach, with a pullback but his low, powerful drive was repelled by Sergio Romero. Paris Saint-Germain star Ezequiel Lavezzi tested Benaglio from striker Gonzalo Higuain's knockdown as Argentina looked to reassert its dominance. Shaqiri was again the provider when a sharp counter attack released Josip Drmic in on goal. With Romero caught in two minds whether to hunt down the through ball, the Bayer Leverkusen striker looked to take advantage with a chip but got the execution horribly wrong. Argentina's stopper continued to look uncertain after the interval as he spilled a Shaqiri free kick from range and had to scramble to prevent the ball from escaping his penalty area. As the hour mark loomed Argentina rediscovered a glimmer of its attacking brio, with Switzerland forced to retreat further and further towards its own goal. As red-shirted legs became heavy La Albiceleste pressed for the breakthrough and Benaglio was prompted into action when Marcos Rojo's attempted cross crept towards the net. Higuain then rose highest to power a header towards goal but Benaglio was alert to acrobatically divert the Napoli striker's effort over the bar. Perhaps inspired by the goal of the tournament so far -- James Rodriguez's explosive volley in Colombia's last-16 win over Uruguay -- Messi attempted his own, firing narrowly over the bar. It looked as though Messi's moment had arrived on 78 minutes as he picked up the ball on the edge of the box and jinked onto his wand of a left foot. But just as the thousands of Argentina fans inside the stadium prepared to hail their saviour once more, Benaglio flung out his right hand to make a superb save and ensure the game remained goalless. As Algeria had done the previous evening, Switzerland burrowed away with the prospect of an extra half an hour the prize at the end of a long, weary tunnel. And despite a few nervous moments, when the right weight of pass or split second decision could have fashioned a late winner, the Swiss saw it through to the end of 90 minutes. The extra half hour continued in the same vain, the Swiss content to soak up pressure in a congested final third and look for counter attacking opportunities. Benaglio was called upon to save from a glancing header from Rodrigo Palacio while Messi was lucky to escape a booking after a tangle with Valon Behrami. Di Maria, who enjoyed such a stellar end of season with European Champions League winners Real Madrid, cut a profligate figure through the game, but tested Benaglio with a stinging drive from range. And his big moment would arrive, as so many of Argentina's have, via the boots of Messi. The three-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner drove towards a flagging Swiss defense before offloading to Di Maria, whose precise finish back across Benaglio found the far corner. That sparked delirium among the hordes of traveling Argentina fans but its side's leaky rearguard almost offered up another twist in the game's dying stages. With Benaglio installed as center forward, a succession of crosses flowed into Argentina's penalty area. From one, midfielder Blerim Dzemaili found himself unmarked and five yards from goal when the ball arrived at his eye level. But his header cannoned off the post with Romero stranded and struck him once more, only for the ball to trickle wide of the upright. Shaqiri then won a free kick right on the edge of the penalty area as nerves at both ends shredded yet further, but once the wall had repelled his effort the final whistle sounded. Coach Alejandro Sabella stuck to the classic football adage of taking one game at a time. ""Our dream is only to work for the next match and try to move onto the semifinals,"" he said. ""We do not look beyond that. To do so would be a mistake as we have already seen good teams like Spain, Uruguay, Italy and England have gone out."" Argentina limps on, but winning ugly won't matter a jot to its players or fans should a first World Cup in 24 years result from it.","Angel Di Maria strikes deep in extra time as Argentina defeat Switzerland 1-0 .

"Libyans cheered the fate of ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi into the early hours of Friday after his death in what Libya's transitional prime minister described as a crossfire that followed his arrest by revolutionary forces. ""This is a time to start a new Libya, with a new economy, with a new education and with a new health system -- with one future,"" Mahmoud Jibril, Libya's transitional prime minister, said after proclaiming Gadhafi's death. Gadhafi was captured alive and unharmed as troops from the National Transitional Council overran his hometown of Sirte on Thursday, Jibril said. But a gunbattle erupted between transitional council fighters and Gadhafi's supporters as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle, Jibril said, leaving Gadhafi with a wound to his right arm. More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi -- who ruled Libya for nearly 42 years before rebel forces overthrew him in August -- was hit in the head, Jibril said, Gadhafi died moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, citing the city's coroner. Grainy video broadcast on Arabic satellite networks captured some of the onetime Libyan strongman's last moments, as the bloodied but still-alive Gadhafi was being hauled onto a truck. Another video showed a dead Gadhafi with what appeared to be a head wound. According to Ali Aujali, Libya's ambassador to the United States, troops found Gadhafi in a large drainage pipe. Daily Telegraph reporter Ben Farmer in Sirte old CNN's Anderson Cooper the pipe is about 3 feet wide and filled with trash and sand. The phrases ""The place of the rat Gadhafi"" and ""You scum"" were painted around its exterior, apparently after the capture. Jibril said Gadhafi was carrying a gun but did not resist his captors. Jibril said DNA samples confirmed Gadhafi's identity, and the International Criminal Court -- which had issued an arrest warrant for the ousted dictator on war-crimes charges -- has agreed to allow Gadhafi's burial. Aujali said the National Transitional Council and the Libyan people wanted Gadhafi to be taken alive to answer for his crimes. In one video from the scene, a voice can be heard shouting, ""No, no, we want him alive, we want him alive."" U.S., NATO and French officials said transitional government fighters captured Gadhafi's convoy after French warplanes and a U.S. drone forced it to a halt on the way out of Sirte. Following Gadhafi's death, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced Thursday that the alliance ""will terminate our mission,"" launched in March under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians. Amnesty International called for the National Transitional Council to mount ""a full, independent and impartial inquiry"" into Gadhafi's death and said his inner circle and family should be ""treated humanely and, if captured, given fair trials."" Abubaker Saad, who was a Gadhafi aide for nine years, said it didn't really matter whether Gadhafi was dead or alive as long as he was no longer a fugitive. ""As long as he was on the run, he represented a very ominous danger to the Libyan people,"" Saad said. ""He represented a very ominous danger ... to the idea of the democracy in Libya."" The streets of Tripoli echoed with celebratory gunfire, car horns and cheers as crowds ran or danced through the streets. Celebrations extended into early Friday in Tripoli and Misrata, where crowds waved flags in the city's main square long after midnight. On the surrounding roads, drivers leaned on their horns and came to brake-squealing stops as bands of revelers darted in and out of traffic. ""A black era has come to an end forever,"" the Libyan ambassador to Britain, Mahmoud Al Nacoua, said in London. National Transitional Council Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil will officially announce on Saturday Libya's liberation, media committee member Mohamed Elkish told CNN on Thursday.  Council officials have said after such a declaration a new government would soon be announced and the democratic transition would begin. Gadhafi's killing caps a revolt that began in February and left him a fugitive for the past two months. The mercurial former army officer, who seized power in a 1969 coup, was the third Arab leader ousted in the Arab Spring upheavals that began in neighboring Tunisia in January. Also killed Thursday were Gadhafi's son Motassim and his chief of intelligence, Abdullah al-Senussi, said Anees al-Sharif, a spokesman for the National Transitional Council's military arm in Tripoli. Other reports say al-Senussi was captured. Jibril said Gadhafi's defense minister, Gen. Abu Baker Younes, also died. Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at the London School of Economics, said Libyans still face a difficult political struggle. But, he added, ""We should not underestimate the significance of this day."" ""Gadhafi was the head of the state, the most important symbol of the country. He repeatedly tried to rally his supporters to fight on,"" Gerges said. ""I hope that this particular day will not just mean the end of an era, but basically represent the beginning of a new era."" Gerges said the recent fighting around Sirte and another holdout of pro-Gadhafi loyalists, Bani Walid, exposed ""some major tribal and regional cleavages"" that Libyans will have to bridge in forming a new government. Those differences ""could easily escalate, given the extent and the intensity of differences in Libya."" But he said Gadhafi's death sends a signal to other strongmen in the region: ""If you oppress your people, if you don't engage your civil society, if you stay in power for so many years, this will be your end."" Fran Townsend, CNN national security contributor, said the transitional leadership ""faces very serious challenges,"" citing groups outside Libya's borders, including al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as internal strife among the country's tribes. ""There will be those around them who seek to take advantage,"" Townsend said. ""There will be tribal differences, there will be Gadhafi loyalists who melt into the population and attempt to launch an insurgency like what we saw in Iraq."" Prince Idris Al-Senussi, whose family was overthrown by Gadhafi 42 years ago, told CNN, ""I feel now that finally I can go back to a free country.  A country that I have loved ... and I feel proud that the Libyan people have done it themselves."" The confirmation of Gadhafi's death came after hours of conflicting reports on the deposed leader's status. When those reports first reached U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a visit to Afghanistan, she reacted with one word: ""Wow."" Clinton said the end of Gadhafi would ""add legitimacy and relief to the formation of a new government."" In a brief address from the White House, President Barack Obama praised Libyans for lifting ""the dark shadow of tyranny"" with the aid of Western air power. ""One year ago, the notion of a free Libya seemed impossible,"" Obama said. ""But then the Libyan people rose up and demanded their rights. And when Gadhafi and his forces started going city to city, town by town, to brutalize men, women and children, the world refused to stand idly by."" NATO, spearheaded by Britain and France, backed up the revolt by bombarding pro-Gadhafi forces. In a statement from his office, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Gadhafi's ouster marks the start of ""a new era ... one of reconciliation in unity and freedom."" British Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday ""is a day to remember all of Colonel Gadhafi's victims,"" including the 270 dead in the bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 and ""the many, many Libyans who died at the hands of this brutal dictator and his regime."" Other world leaders sounded encouragement for a new Libya, but cautioned that the road ahead won't be easy. ""In the coming days, we will witness scenes of celebration, as well as grief for those who lost so much,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. ""Yet let us recognize, immediately, that this is only the end of the beginning. The road ahead for Libya and its people will be difficult and full of challenges.""","Libyan prince happy there is now a ""free country""

"In the days after last month's Boston marathon bombings, the city was on edge. Residents were holed up in their homes, under strict orders not to leave.  Investigators sifted through countless hours of surveillance images trying to determine who might have carried out this heinous attack. Then came a breakthrough. Three days after the April 15 attack, the FBI identified the bombing suspects captured in surveillance images near the finish line, later identified as Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Suspect: Boston attack was payback for hits on Muslims . And a manhunt was on. Hours after that FBI news conference, Boston and the rest of the country followed as the suspects allegedly shot and killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer in a failed attempt to seize his gun, carjacked a black Mercedes SUV whose driver cleverly escaped at a gas station, then fled to the Boston suburb of Watertown, where they were confronted by police. Interactive map of the Boston attacks, manhunt . Now, almost a month later, two police sources have shed new light on exactly what happened when police confronted the two suspects in Watertown during the early hours of April 19, triggering a gun battle unlike anything recently seen on the streets of an American city. Among the new details from the two police sources: . -- Police fired nearly 300 rounds of ammunition within five to 10 minutes as they confronted the suspects -- 100 more than initially reported. And that included one round that nearly killed Massachusetts Transit Police Officer Richard Donohue.  (Others bullets struck the Tsarnaev brothers, seriously injuring Dzhokhar and contributing to the death of Tamerlan.) -- Tamerlan was the only brother armed with a handgun.  The only other weapons they had were the homemade explosives that police say the brothers tossed out of the hijacked vehicle, including a few that detonated. -- Police accidentally fired on an unoccupied black SUV during the mayhem. ""In the chaos, an officer or trooper (or some combination of personnel) mistook it for one of the two suspect vehicles,"" David Procopio of the Massachusetts State Police told CNN. Boston fire chief gets vote of 'no confidence' in handling of bombings . In the beginning, all police knew just before 11 p.m. Thursday, April 19, was that a man was down in Cambridge. They would later learn that MIT campus police officer Sean Collier had been shot and killed in his patrol car. A short time later, at least half a dozen police agencies responded to a call from help from the Watertown Police Department, after an officer spotted two cars that the Tsarnaevs were driving. The officers converged on the narrow residential intersection of Dexter and Laurel streets in Watertown.  The Tsarnaev brothers were in the middle of the street, after lobbing the homemade explosives. Law enforcement sources told CNN that the only other weapon the brothers had was a single handgun used by Tamerlan, but investigators have not confirmed that. The final hours that paralyzed Boston . ""We have not commented publicly on that and I'm not in a position to do so at this time,"" Procopio said.  ""Obviously, that is part of the investigation."" The extraordinary gun battle played out in front of Andrew Kitzenberg, who captured photos of the scene on his iPhone from his upstairs apartment on Dexter Street. In one image taken by Kitzenberg, the two suspects are crouched behind the black SUV as they engage in gunfire.  Kitzenberg said the two men had been transferring bags from a green sedan that one of the brothers drove to the scene. At one point, Tamerlan approached police on foot, with explosives on his body and an explosive trigger, firing his handgun at the officers who returned fire, mortally wounding him.  A police officer tackled him, then handcuffed him on the ground.  Around the same time, Dzhokhar grabbed the wheel of the hijacked SUV and drove toward the police. ""As soon as the SUV turned around in the street,"" Kitzenberg told CNN's Drew Griffin, ""it was accelerated gunfire."" Source: Russia withheld details about Tsarnaev . At some point, Dzhokhar was shot and wounded.  As he drove the SUV toward the officers who had restrained his brother, the police scrambled out of the way and Dzhokhar proceeds to drive over his brother. Tamerlan later dies from the gunshot wound and the blunt force trauma of being run over, according to his death certificate. Several hours later, a seriously injured Dzhokhar was arrested a few blocks away in Watertown, where he was hiding underneath a covered boat in someone's backyard. Massachusetts State Police and the Middlesex District Attorney's office are investigating the entire sequence of events that night, beginning with Collier's death in Cambridge. ""That shoot review, which is ongoing, will include examination of any potential friendly fire incidents,"" Procopio said.  While Donohue was the only officer seriously injured in the Watertown shooting, another officer was also grazed by a bullet. In high-pressure situations, police often experience ""contagion shooting,"" a former Branford, Connecticut, police chief said.  And that's most likely what happened in Watertown. What did suspected bomber's widow know? ""If you look back at some of the other cases in the past, then it immediately causes a contagion and other people start shooting,"" said John DeCarlo, now an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of New Haven. The gunfight in Watertown was so intense that bullets came flying through a home about a half a block from the shooting scene. ""They landed right near our staircase, near the pedestal and the other near our closet,"" said Harry Ohannesian, who showed CNN several bullet holes in his house.  ""They went through one, exited, went through another closet and landed under the staircase."" The chaos in Watertown that led to the friendly fire shooting of Donohue can be compared to a war zone, DeCarlo explained. ""Things (that) occur in the very dynamic moments of a situation like this ... are not necessarily -- no matter how hard police work -- what they are trained to do,"" said the former police chief, noting that none of his remarks are intended as criticism of police. Procopio concurred with that comparison: . ""Considering the chaos and the battlefield conditions -- where a pair of homicidal terrorists were firing shots and throwing bombs at police -- the fact that friendly fire incidents might have occurred detracts nothing -- not one bit -- from the valor exhibited by the police officers and state troopers present that night,"" the Massachusetts State Police spokesman said.

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Tehran, Iran, have given the go-ahead to execute a woman who initially was sentenced to death by stoning, according to an activist working on her behalf. However, what method will be used to execute Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani is unclear, said Mina Ahadi, spokeswoman for the International Committee Against Stoning. The execution could happen as soon as Wednesday, she said, citing information received from a source in Tabriz, Iran, who is close to Ashtiani's family. Ashtiani initially was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery. The Iranian government later said she was also convicted of murdering her husband, but her lawyer and family dispute that. A letter from Tehran was delivered to the prison in Tabriz where Ashtiani is being held three days ago, Ahadi said, giving the go-ahead for Ashtiani's execution. Ashtiani, 43 and a mother of two, drew international attention when she was sentenced to death by stoning. She concedes that she was convicted of adultery, as initially reported, but says she was acquitted of murder. ""The man who actually killed my husband was identified and imprisoned, but he is not sentenced to death,"" she said in August. The Iranian government's claims that she was convicted of murder are a lie, she told the Guardian newspaper through an intermediary. ""They are embarrassed by the international attention on my case, and they are desperately trying to distract attention and confuse the media so that they can kill me in secret."" Ashtiani's son and her attorney are still in jail after being arrested last month, Ahadi said. Also still detained are two German journalists. ""The International Committees against Stoning and Execution call on international bodies and the people of the world to come out in full force against the state-sponsored murder of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani,"" as well as the release of the others, Ahadi said in a statement. Before his arrest, Ashtiani's son, Sajjad Ghaderzadeh, said court officials stole documents and files pertaining to the murder of his father in order to ""promote his mother as a murderer."" And Ahadi's committee said the murder charges are ""fabricated"" by the Iranian regime. In August, Ashtiani appeared on state TV confessing that she knew about a plot to kill her husband but felt she had been misled. Amnesty International condemned the interview. Ghaderzadeh and attorney Hootan Kian will not be issued an attorney, because the government claims they do not need one, according to Ahadi. Ashtiani's other former lawyer, Mohammad Mostafaei, is being protected by European diplomats after he fled to Turkey from Iran. Mostafaei claims that Iranian authorities tried to arrest him without cause.","Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani could be executed as soon as Wednesday .

"When ""Economic News"" aired last week on China's state-run TV channel, its viewers who number in the millions noticed something odd: the chair where star journalist Rui Chenggang sits was empty. The 37-year-old Rui was taken away shortly before airtime Friday by prosecutors as part of a widening anti-corruption investigation. He is one of China's most prominent and controversial television anchors who once led a successful campaign to get Starbucks kicked out of the Forbidden City. And his detention has attracted global coverage. Here are five things to know to put in context why Rui's case is significant: . How popular is he? Keyword: 10,000,000. As the face of China Central Television's financial news channel, Rui presents its flagship show ""Economic News,"" which is said to easily draw more than 10 million viewers every night. Fluent in English and well-versed in Western culture, he's often the ""go to"" guy at CCTV for foreign leaders and industry titans. He has interviewed hundreds of big names ranging from Bill Clinton to Bill Gates, and touted his friendship with the world's rich and powerful in two best-selling autobiographies. On Sina Weibo -- China's equivalent of Twitter -- Rui commands more than 10 million followers, making him the most popular CCTV personality in social media. Why is he controversial? Keyword: Nationalistic. Rui shot to fame in 2007 when he led a successful campaign to kick Starbucks out of the Forbidden City in Beijing. He called the American coffee shop's presence in the historic palace museum an encroachment on Chinese culture. The campaign won him both ardent fans and critics. Unabashedly nationalistic, he often defends government policies on the world stage and is known for baiting American officials. In 2010, when U.S. President Barack Obama said he would give the final question at a press conference in Seoul to South Korean media, Rui declared: ""I'm actually Chinese, but I think I get to represent the entire Asia."" At an economic forum the following year, Rui asked Gary Locke, then the U.S. ambassador to China: ""My colleagues told me you flew economy class here -- was that a reminder that the U.S. still owes China money?"" What got him in trouble? Keyword: Corruption. Speculation about Rui's troubles began last month when his longtime patron Guo Zhenxi, the head of state-run CCTV's financial news channel, was detained for allegedly accepting bribes. State media have said his detention is closely linked to Guo's case, as well as an investigation into his own possible profiting from using CCTV resources. Reports have since surfaced that Rui -- already a CCTV journalist -- co-founded a public relations company called Pegasus in 2002 and remained an important -- though minority -- shareholder for more than eight years. After being acquired by the U.S. public relations giant Edelman in 2007, Pegasus started counting CCTV as a client two years later while Rui was still a stakeholder in the firm. Why is his detention significant? Keyword: Politics. Rui's reported detention is but the latest twist in an intensifying campaign launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping against official corruption, a lightning rod for mass discontent. When describing his resolve to spare no one -- regardless of position -- in his anti-corruption drive, Xi has said he would strike ""tigers and flies"" alike. CCTV recently counted the capture of 35 ""tigers"" -- including a retired top general and a former national leader -- since Xi took power less than two years ago. In the grand scheme of things, Rui appears to be a ""fly"" caught in Xi's widening net. Many observers, however, have noted his ties -- albeit indirect -- to Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar who has been rumored to be the biggest ""tiger"" under investigation. Guo, Rui's patron at CCTV, has long been considered belonging to the Zhou faction. What is the public reaction? Keyword: Divided. After the initial shock, thousands of Rui's loyal fans have left messages on his Sina Weibo page to express continued support for their role model. The more prevailing sentiment in Chinese cyberspace, however, appears to be one of schadenfreude with many ""netizens"" cheering Rui's downfall. ""Considering Rui hasn't really hurt anyone, it's impressive to see how many people he has disgusted or offended,"" tweeted Michael Anti, a leading Chinese commentator. ""It's just telling how stinky the reputation is for the Communist Party's human mouthpieces, whether Chinese or English speakers."" People's Daily, the Party's official newspaper, seems to feel obliged to respond, reminding readers in a commentary published online: ""Rui is not a spokesman for patriotism. The only bases for his crime and punishment should be evidence and laws -- it has absolutely nothing to do with patriotism.""","His show draws more than 10 million viewers nightly .

"(CNN)For the first time since two people died in the terrifying sinking of the Bounty in Hurricane Sandy, federal officials Monday pointed fingers at what likely caused the disaster. Bounty Capt. Robin Walbridge's ""reckless decision to sail ... into the well-forecast path of Hurricane Sandy"" was the probable cause of the tall ship's October 2012 sinking off the coast of North Carolina, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a report released Monday. The ship, carrying 16 crew members, flipped sideways in heavy seas and high winds, spilling everyone into the Atlantic. Walbridge, 63, was never found and is presumed dead; deckhand Claudene Christian -- a 42-year-old rookie -- died after Coast Guard rescuers were unable to revive her. The NTSB report -- and a similar investigation report expected to be released by the Coast Guard -- could lead to  changes in rules governing how attraction vessels like the Bounty are inspected for safety. Before the ship left port in New London, Connecticut, for St. Petersburg, Florida, the captain indicated he knew the hurricane was moving up the Eastern Seaboard, according to crew testimony at Coast Guard hearings in 2013. Heading into the storm's path ""subjected the aging vessel and the inexperienced crew to conditions from which the vessel could not recover,"" Monday's NTSB report said. Ten of Bounty's crew members had been aboard for less than a year -- including two who had joined less than a month before the sinking. ""The Bounty's crew was put into an extraordinarily hazardous situation through decisions that by any measure didn't prioritize safety,"" NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said in a statement. The report said it's ""possible that the captain may have focused too narrowly on the position of the storm's eye instead of on Sandy's total expanse."" The storm was huge, spanning more than 1,000 miles in diameter. The ""area into which the Bounty was heading was already under tropical storm warnings, with conditions forecasted to worsen,"" the report said. ""Still the captain seemed to believe that he could outrace the storm."" By the time the captain and crew realized the ship was sinking, the Bounty was tossing in 30-foot seas and being battered by 103 mph winds about 100 miles off Cape Hatteras. During the Coast Guard hearings 14 surviving crew members testified. Not one leveled any blame for the disaster at their shipmates or at Walbridge. On Monday, Bounty survivor Jessica Hewitt told CNN on the phone that some of the report's nuances rubbed her the wrong way. She said the report mistakenly paints the captain as disregarding the crew's well being. ""Robin thought a lot about safety,"" said Hewitt, who almost drowned during the first few minutes after the ship flipped on its side. ""But I agree that he also during his career had been walking this line of going out in big storms and making it."" They made it through the storms, despite Bounty's less-than-perfect condition, Hewitt said, because Walbridge ""was good -- and the crew was good. That boat lasted so long because he was so good."" When Bounty crew member Joshua Scornavacchi spoke with CNN Tuesday about the NTSB report, he questioned the command decisions made during the ship's the final hours. Scornavacchi said that as soon as Walbridge ""figured out that the pumps weren't working right -- and that we wouldn't be able to get them started again -- we probably should have abandoned ship."" That was about four or five hours before the ship turned on its side, he said. Related: A year after the sinking brings messages in a bottle . The Bounty was arguably the world's most famous traditionally rigged replica ship. The three-masted square rigger appeared in several Hollywood films, including the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. Related: Life & Death on the Bounty . At Coast Guard hearings, crew members testified that the Bounty suffered from a reputation in the tall-ship community for shoddy maintenance and spotty training. ""Contributing to the sinking was the lack of effective safety oversight by the vessel organization,"" Monday's report said. The report stated that, although the Bounty took on water even in good conditions and wood rot had been discovered, the captain gave no order to ensure all onboard pumps were fully operational before departing. This, despite his knowledge that the ship was sure to encounter rough seas as it sailed closer to Sandy, according to the report. ""The vessel could have handled the storm, if everything on the ship had worked right,"" Scornavacchi said. ""The boat's pumps didn't work right. They stopped working."" It's a ""possibility"" that the ship's owners and Walbridge bear some responsibility, he said. ""They're probably the ones who were supposed to keep after that."" Robert Hansen, a representative of the ship owner HMS Bounty Organization, LLC, e-mailed CNN: ""I am unable to comment on the report (which we have not seen) or the pending litigation."" Scornavacchi said he hoped the tragedy would bring to light the extreme difficulty he and his fellow survivors had trying to climb inside the Bounty's life rafts after the ship sank. ""I don't know who makes those rafts, but they should redesign them,"" he said. He also said immersion survival suits should be designed with cuffs around the neck openings to prevent them from filling with water. ""If it fills with water, it's impossible to pull yourself out of the ocean,"" Scornavacchi said. For decades before the sinking, the Bounty sailed as an attraction vessel -- moving from port to port and charging tourists admission to board it while it was docked. To charge admission for shipboard tours at dockside, the Bounty required only a simple, brief Coast Guard inspection that checked for obvious safety issues such as major leaks or malfunctioning emergency equipment. The Bounty passed one of these about two months before the disaster. Christian's family has filed a civil lawsuit against the ship's owner. The case is currently in settlement talks. Christian's parents are ""not doing well at all,"" the family's attorney Ralph Mellusi told CNN. ""We now have one report — and when the next one comes down, that will help put some closure on this for them.""","Bounty survivor: Captain should have ordered crew to abandon ship 4 hours sooner .

"Arsenic in apple juice. It's a scary statement -- one that's received a lot of attention in recent years, although some say the concern is unwarranted. After prodding from consumer groups, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has conducted their own investigation and is proposing a maximum limit for arsenic levels in apple juice. The FDA plans to limit the amount of inorganic arsenic to 10 parts per billion -- the same amount the Environmental Protection Agency allows in drinking water. This is the first time the FDA has set limits for arsenic levels in food or drink products. The move comes two years after an episode of ""The Dr. Oz Show"" raised public concern about the amount of arsenic in children's apple juice. The show tested three dozen samples of five brands of juice and found some contained arsenic levels between 11 and 36 parts per billion. Shortly after, Consumer Reports released a study that analyzed 88 samples of apple and grape juice. The researchers found about 10% of the samples had arsenic levels higher than 10 parts per billion. There are two types of arsenic: inorganic and organic. Inorganic arsenic has been classified as a human carcinogen by the EPA. The FDA describes organic, or naturally-occurring arsenic as ""essentially harmless."" ""This chemical element is found in the Earth's crust,"" Michael Taylor, the FDA's deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine, wrote on the government agency's blog. ""It's everywhere in the environment and can be found in water, air and soil, in both organic and inorganic forms. Human activities also can introduce arsenic into the environment."" Although the FDA's new rules are not yet in effect, the agency says parents shouldn't be worried. Last year they analyzed the arsenic levels in 94 samples of apple juice. The analysis showed that 95% of the samples tested were below 10 parts per billion for both organic and inorganic arsenic; 100% of the samples were below 10 parts per billion for inorganic arsenic. ""Apple juice producers, as well as the FDA, want people to know they can be confident that apple juice is safe,"" Rick Cristol, president of the Juice Products Association, said in a statement, noting that juice companies routinely test their products. ""Arsenic is a naturally occurring element in the environment and may be found in the air, soil and water. It is commonly found in harmless, trace amounts in many crops and naturally sourced foods. Humans have been exposed to it for thousands of years."" Long-term exposure to arsenic, which is odorless and tasteless, has been linked to cancer of the bladder, skin, kidney, nasal passages, liver and prostate, according to the EPA. Scientists also know that arsenic can affect the nervous system, causing headaches, numbness and tremors, and can damage your blood vessels. There is also some evidence that frequent exposure could lower children's IQ levels, the CDC says. The association also notes in the statement that holding apple juice to the same arsenic guidelines as drinking water isn't appropriate because people consume more water on a regular basis. In 2011, Consumer Reports released a study that analyzed 88 samples of apple and grape juice. The researchers found about 10% of the samples --including ones from well-known brands -- had arsenic levels higher than 10 parts per billion. Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, has advocated since then for a 3 parts per billion limit but said in a statement that it is happy with the FDA's ""reasonable first step."" The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends babies under 6 months of age not drink any type of juice, and that children 1 to 6 years old should have no more than 4 to 6 ounces a day. The FDA has to accept public comments on their proposal for 60 days before these recommendations can be implemented.","The FDA proposes new limits for amounts of inorganic arsenic allowed in apple juice .

"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- Annise Parker made history Saturday as Houston's first openly gay mayor. Parker, who served five years as city controller, beat former city attorney Gene Locke with 53.6 percent of the vote in a runoff election. Both are Democrats who faced off for the second time because neither emerged with more than 50 percent of the vote in the November 3 election. Parker's election also makes her the second woman to become mayor of Houston. Other cities such as Providence, Rhode Island, and Portland, Oregon, have picked openly gay mayors. Houston is the fourth-largest U.S. city. Parker's victory is also remarkable because a few years ago, Houston rejected a referendum to offer benefits to same-sex partners of city workers. Also, the city sits in a state where gay marriage is against the law. ""Houston is a multiracial, multicultural, international city. And I think my election will send a message to the world that Houston is a city that might surprise a lot of folks,"" Parker said before the runoff. Parker, 53, has never shied away from, nor made an issue of, her sexual orientation. She has been with her partner for 19 years and they have two adopted children. She was elected to the city council and then spent the past five years as city controller. She ran for mayor on a platform of fiscal conservatism. ""I have always stood up for the fact that I am gay. It's part of the resume that I bring to the table, but it's just a piece of the package,"" she said. After the mayoral race entered a runoff, conservatives and anti-gay activists mounted an intense campaign against Parker. Houston residents received flyers in the mail that highlighted Parker's support from gay groups and her relationship with her partner. ""There's a certain segment of Houston, there's a certain segment of society that has problems with the issues around sexual orientation,"" Parker said. ""But the citizens of Houston have elected me six consecutive times to public office. They know me, they trust me. ""I think it's a small and shrinking minority of Houstonians who have that attitude and I look forward to it as being mayor of all of Houston,"" she said. Turnout was light Saturday. Only 16.4 percent of the eligible voters cast ballots, according to the results from Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located. Locke received 46.4 percent of the vote. Parker will take office in January, replacing Bill White who could not run because of term limits. CNN's Ed Lavendera and Don Lemon contributed to this report.","Annise Parker elected mayor of Houston, becomes first lesbian to lead a major U.S. city .

"North Korea launched four Scud missiles into the sea off its eastern coast Thursday, the South Korean Defense Ministry said. The missiles were fired in the direction of Russia and fell into the sea, according to the Pentagon, which described the launch as a very low-level matter. The missiles were fired just days after the start of annual joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States that North Korea opposes. The joint military exercises routinely spark tension between North Korea, South Korea and the United States. For example, last year's exercises triggered weeks of heightened tensions between the nations and North Korean threats of nuclear war. The South Korean and U.S. militaries have not been specific about where they are conducting their drills. The South Korean Defense Ministry said that the North had fired the Scuds in a northeasterly direction and that they probably fell into North Korean waters of the East Sea, which is also known as the Sea of Japan. It was the first time North Korea had fired Scud missiles, which have a range that covers the whole of the Korean Peninsula, since 2009, South Korea said. ""We consider it to be threatening and a military provocation,"" said South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Ming-seok, although he acknowledged the firings may have been a test launch or part of military drills. Foreign policy experts say the North Korean missile firings may not herald a repeat of last year's saber rattling from Pyongyang, which included threats of preemptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea and the declaration that the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953 is null and void. North Korea tested a multistage rocket with possible intercontinental potential in December 2012, and carried out a third nuclear test in February 2013. It was then stung by fierce international criticism and sanctions. It reacted angrily when 2013's joint military exercises between South Korea and the U.S. involved stealth bombers simulating bombing attacks. The conditions of Thursday's missile launch are different. North Korea's missile capabilities . ""It may be little more than regular military testing,"" said Michael O'Hanlon, a defense and foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution. ""I'm not persuaded it's a big deal or even a medium big deal, though."" The launch may also be an attempt by North Korea to remind the world and its own people that it has muscle, too. Most observers say North Korea is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile, but it does have plenty of conventional military firepower, including medium-range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles. ""North Korea's missile launch is merely part of their ongoing efforts to demonstrate to the world, and more importantly to their own people, what they are capable of.  It is more showmanship than meaningful geopolitics,"" David Rothkopf, editor of Foreign Policy magazine, said Thursday. ""It is not a surprise, and we should expect more of the same so long as this regime is in place."" Earlier this week, South Korea said a North Korean patrol boat strayed over the maritime border between the two countries several times. It eventually returned to the North's side of the border after warnings from South Korea. Such infringements happen periodically, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry.

"(CNN) -- Former teen idol David Cassidy faces a drunken driving charge after a Florida Highway Patrol officer stopped him on a Fort Pierce, Florida, highway Wednesday night. Cassidy, 60, failed roadside sobriety tests and registered at .14 on an alcohol breath test, according to the arrest report. A reading of .08 or higher is illegal for drivers in Florida. The singer-actor ""appeared to be somewhat confused"" and was ""very apologetic for having to be stopped,"" the arresting officer said. Police found a half-empty bottle of bourbon under the seat of Cassidy's Mercedes, although he told the officer he had only consumed a glass of wine with lunch several hours earlier, the report said. He told the officer he took a hydrocodone pill -- a pain medication also known as Vicodin -- about three hours earlier. The trooper pulled Cassidy over after his car left the roadway and went onto the shoulder rumble strip two times before cutting off another car at an exit ramp, the police report said. Cassidy posted bail early Thursday and was released from the St. Lucie County Jail, according a jail spokeswoman. Cassidy's publicist said his lawyer advised her not to comment yet on the incident. ""David would, however, like to assure everyone that he is all right and thank his family, friends and fans for their love and support,"" publicist Jo-Ann Geffen said. Cassidy starred on ""The Partridge Family"" in the 1970s, launching his pop music career. He would fill concert venues with screaming teen-aged girls with such hits as ""I Think I Love You."" His most recent acting job was on the ABC Family sitcom ""Ruby & the Rockits,"" in which Cassidy played an aging former teen heartthrob. The show was canceled this year after its first season.","NEW: Cassidy was released from jail on bail early Thursday .

"With names like Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent under its belt, it's little wonder Paris has earned a reputation as one of the fashion capitals of the world. If ""French chic"" has become synonymous with the elegance, grace and style of its country's powerhouse fashion labels and catwalk shows, this weekend that glamor will be out in force on a very different type of track -- the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Your average horse race this is not. While Britain's Royal Ascot often displays images of Tango-colored ladies kicking off their heels, their French counterparts take a distinctly more demure approach to a day at the races. ""French dressing is less spectacular than Ascot, it's less extroverted,"" Arc spokesman Julien Pescatore said. ""The French style is very classic. It's about elegance, beauty and glamor."" Such was the clampdown on decorum at this year's Royal Ascot, organizers went to the extent of publishing style guides for race-goers. Ladies were advised that all dresses were to be of ""modest"" length -- defined as ""falling just above the knee or longer."" Shorts and shoulderless dresses were also deemed a non-no. While Parisian race-goers adhere to a more classic style, one fashion accessory appears universal -- the obligatory outrageous hat. ""The hat is an essential element of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe,"" says Pescatore. ""It started in the 1920s as a way to convey some eccentricity, to do some showing-off. Today that might mean a hat with the Eiffel Tower on top."" Set on the picturesque Longchamp racecourse in Paris, ""the Arc,"" as it is known, prides itself on being Europe's most prestigious -- and richest -- horse race. With almost  €8 million ($10.4 million) in prize money on offer over the weekend, the Qatar Racing and Equestrian Club-sponsored event attracts an elite clientele of royalty, world leaders and business heavyweights. Each year the grandstands fill with the ""crème de la crème"" of European society, with Monaco's Princess Charlotte Casiraghi, the daughter of Princess Caroline, and Spanish model Irene Salvador some of the glamorous guests in 2011. For the super rich wanting to beat the crowds, a helicopter flying from London to Issy-les-Moulineaux in Paris will take around one hour and 45 minutes -- and set you back a whopping £5,480 ($8,874). That's not to mention the 15-minute car hire from Issy-les-Moulineaux  to Longchamp costing another £200 ($323). The Arc's slogan: ""Ce n'est pas une course, c'est un monument"" -- ""Not so much a race as a monument,"" points to the grand imagery surrounding this uniquely French event. Founded in 1920, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe was named after the very monument built in honor of French allied forces during World War One. This year will mark the 91st  Arc, which has only been canceled twice in its illustrious history -- in 1939 and 1940 during World War Two. Yet despite this emphasis on prestige, the Arc also remains one of Europe's most accessible races for the average punter, with general admission to Sunday's headline event costing just €8 ($10.4). A ticket to Royal Ascot's grandstand, meanwhile, will cost you £75 ($121). Arc organizers are preparing for a huge Japanese contingent this year, as horse Orfevre aims to deliver the country's first win at Longchamp. The Japanese triple crown winner had been a co-favorite to win the race alongside Epsom Derby winner Camelot. But its chances now look unlikely after drawing the far outside stall 18, where just one horse has won in the 92-year history of the race. Nonetheless there will still be Japanese-speaking stewards at betting desks to assist the large numbers of Asian punters expected. It may be known as ""The Sport of Kings,"" but come Sunday the Arc may also be referred to as the ""Sport of Bakers"" if French Derby winner Saonois takes the crown. Bought by a prosperous baker for just €10,000 ($13,056) as a yearling, Saonois is now the other favorite to win the race after drawing the plumb stall of two. Whatever the outcome, one thing is for sure, the French crowd will be celebrating in style.","Think ""French chic"" and the words elegance, style and grace spring to mind .

"Did President Barack Obama do the right thing when he agreed to trade Taliban leaders in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl? The issue has become a weapon in the partisan political arsenal and it will surely join the Benghazi incident in election season. And yet, the Bergdahl deal is something quite different. When Obama approved the release of dangerous, top-value Guantanamo prisoners in exchange for an American soldier captured under mysterious circumstances, he negotiated a tangle of competing moral principles. If it were possible to wrestle with these issues in a nonpartisan way, the country might gain from this difficult experience. The Bergdahl-Taliban trade will be discussed in ethics classes for years to come. Here are some of the hard questions: . 1) America holds two principles high on its moral agenda. First, the U.S. does not leave any of its soldiers behind in the battlefield. Second, the U.S. does not negotiate with terrorists. But what happens when the two principles collide? Which matters more? Obama has made his position clear: ""We don't leave men and women in uniform behind."" The administration argues it did not negotiate with terrorists. And although the United States does not classify the Taliban as a terrorist organization, the Taliban, including those released in the deal, have worked with al Qaeda and have had a major role in killing thousands of civilians. Khirulla Khairkhwa, for example, according to secret U.S. documents released by WikiLeaks, was ""directly associated"" with Osama bin Laden. Mohammad Fazl, according to Human Rights Watch, presided over the killing of thousands of Shiite Muslims. A transaction that frees members of a shadowy organization lends the group prestige. It invigorates it and sends the message that taking prisoners ultimately pays. The U.S. broke one of its rules. But it had to. The two rules were mutually exclusive. The U.S. had to break one in choosing a path through this moral dilemma. 2) Does the rule of ""leave no one behind"" apply to deserters? We don't know much about how Bergdahl came to become a prisoner. But many of his comrades in the field say Bergdahl walked away from his post by choice. He reportedly emailed his father before leaving, ""The future is too good to waste on lies"" and left a note in his tent saying he was leaving, according to The New York Times. Soldiers say six Americans died trying to find him after he left. If that is true, does the ""leave no one"" rule still apply to him? Obama says: ""We still get an American soldier back if he is held in captivity. Period. Full stop. We don't condition that."" It's an unsettling decision, particularly for the relatives of those who may have died trying to save him. But the rule sends a message to other American soldiers that their country takes this solemn commitment very seriously. If Bergdahl is a deserter, he should face justice on that count. If his desertion caused America such an awful price, he -- and the country -- will have to live with that. 3) Does the life of one man we know warrant losing the lives of many whom we don't know? There is an ugly truth hanging over any prisoner exchange with an active enemy: It saves one life, but it is likely to cost many more. If the trade were a simple mathematical calculation, it would make no sense. The U.S. says 17%, perhaps as many as 29%, of those released from Guantanamo Bay have turned to terrorism. The predicament is familiar to Israel, which has released thousands of convicted prisoners in lopsided trades for a handful of Israelis, even for the bodies of Israelis killed by their captors. The decision is wrenching even when the soldier gaining his freedom was captured through no fault of his own. In 2011, Israel traded 1,027 Palestinians, including many convicted in terrorist attacks that killed scores of civilians, in exchange for Gilad Shalit, who had been held by Hamas for five years. By then, Israeli statistics already showed that terrorists freed in exchange for 19 Israelis over the years had gone on to kill 182 more. Still, they went ahead with the deal, and the public supported it. Shalit had become an Israeli icon, everyone's child. But the fact is that one person, with a name, a family, a face, somehow takes more value than other nameless ones who may die later as the result of the trade. 4) If a person should be saved, what cost is too high? Is there a limit? Just how much is one American soldier worth? As far as we know, the deal with Bergdahl brought five of the top Taliban leaders to freedom -- although they are supposed to remain in Qatar for one year. Other countries have paid large amounts of cash as ransom to free their citizens. The price is not only the amount exchanged at the moment of the trade. It is also what happens with that currency whether it's people or money. Unrest in parts of North Africa, which has left hundreds, perhaps thousands dead, was financed in part by ransom money paid by various governments. 5) If a prisoner exchange is politically costly but morally correct, should a politician support it? Obama must have known there would be political fallout. He made his decision. Hillary Clinton, too, is lending measured support to the trade. None of these is an easy question. Each country answers them in the light of its own values and priorities. America would do well to examine them in a nonpolitical way, as a crafting of the nation's beliefs, and a guide for making moral choices in the future. Who was swapped for Bergdahl?","Frida Ghitis: Obama dealt with reconciling ""no deal with terrorists,"" ""no one left behind""
Ghitis: Another issue: If Bergdahl left his post, does ""leave no one behind"" apply to deserters?

"Diving 27 meters underwater, the light turns a deep, hazy blue. Emerging from the darkness, three ballerinas in white tutus stretch their legs on the deck of a sunken military ship. It's not a ghostly apparition but one of a series of haunting photographs displayed in the only underwater gallery of its kind in the world. The 12 sumptuous images of everyday scenes -- from a housewife hanging out washing to a teenager watching TV -- take place against the eerie backdrop of sunken ship USNS General Hoyt S.Vandenberg. The 10,000 ton ship -- located off the coast of Florida -- functions as both the backdrop in these evocative photographs and, for a time, the gallery wall on which they're hung. ""Divers must have been checking their oxygen levels to make sure they weren't seeing things,"" said Jed Dodd, executive director of The Studios of Key West, which showed the Vandenberg Project exhibition. ""Diving is already a dreamlike experience and I think these images really correspond with what people imagine an underwater world might look like."" Viennese artist Andreas Franke, who worked as an advertising photographer for more than 20 years, took the powerful images while on a diving exhibition last year. Sunk just off Key West , an island in the Straits of Florida, in 2009, the Vandenberg is the second-largest artificial reef in the world, attracting a diverse range of marine animals and plant life. But before her most recent reincarnation as a divers' paradise, the historic vessel cruised the waves as a U.S. transport ship during World War II. It was this rich history that gave Franke the inspiration for his unique World War II era scenes. The 45-year-old artist used specialist underwater cameras to capture the ship, before heading back to the studio to photograph models in 1940s and 1950s costumes. The retro scenes were then superimposed over the top of the Vandenberg, creating an eerie underwater world frozen in time. ""It's like bringing the Vandenberg back to life,"" Franke said. ""It's a huge empty ship with fish swimming around -- at 27 meters below the surface, the sunlight is this beautiful blue green color. I shot the models in the studio with the same lens, so the images matched."" Around 10,000 divers visited the underwater exhibition and now, after four months sitting on the ocean floor, the unique pictures have come up for air, displayed in their first exhibition on land. Despite being protected between two sheets of plexiglass and sealed with silicon in a steel frame, the images were not left completely untouched by the ravishes of the ocean. The all-pervasive sea water still left its mark, seeping into the frames and discoloring them with salt stains and algae. ""When we brought the photographs to the surface we found all this growth on them -- it's a third dimension on top,"" Franke said. ""The sea life had created new images. It's very cool, they almost look like Polaroids."" The remarkable pictures, worth up to $30,000, had crossed the realm from photographs to performance art, said Dodd. ""The extra layer of growth tells the story of their voyage to the bottom of the seabed,"" he added. ""When they were first brought into the gallery and unpacked, this intense smell went through the building like a windstorm. They feel like living objects."" While the Vandenberg photographs attract art lovers on land, Franke's latest underwater project is bewitching divers again -- this time off the coast of Barbados. Displayed on the sunken SS Stavronikita, the 12 new images depict Renaissance aristocracy gallivanting in a palatial underwater setting. Much like the Vandenberg, Franke superimposed the baroque scenes on top of the former 1950s Greek freighter, where they are now displayed. ""The shipwreck has been down there 35 years so there's this wonderful, overwhelming growth and coral,"" Franke said. ""If you look at the elaborate hairstyles of the models it fits pretty well with this surrounding."" They may appear pristine now, but if the Vandenberg is anything to go by, the lavish ladies of the Stavronikita may not be so picture perfect when they finally come up for air.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A giant panda cub -- the only one this year in the United States -- was born early Wednesday at Zoo Atlanta, the zoo said in a statement. Lun Lun, a 13-year-old female panda, gave birth to the cub at 5:39 a.m. ET in a specially prepared birthing den inside the zoo's giant panda building, according to the statement. ""Lun Lun appears to be providing appropriate care for her cub, which is roughly the size of a cell phone,"" the statement said. The facility's animal management and veterinary teams were monitoring the mother and cub round-the-clock, and ""a preliminary veterinary checkup will be performed as soon as staff is able to remove the cub without disrupting maternal care."" The cub is the third for Lun Lun and mate Yang Yang. It will be introduced to the public in spring 2011, the zoo said. Yang Yang, 13, and the cub's older brother, Xi Lan, remain on exhibit and will not be introduced to the new addition. ""The separation is normal for giant pandas, which are solitary in the wild,"" the statement said. Zoo Atlanta announced Lun Lun's pregnancy last month. Zoos in Memphis, Tennessee; San Diego, California; and Washington also have pandas, but none produced a cub this year. The couple's firstborn, Mei Lan, has lived at China's Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding since February. She was born in September 2006. Xi Lan, born in August 2008, ""remains one of the zoo's most popular and precocious animal stars"" the statement said. All three births came about by artificial insemination. For the most recent cub, Lun Lun was artificially inseminated on June 13. ""We are extremely excited about welcoming Lun Lun's and Yang Yang's third cub, and proud of the success of Zoo Atlanta's giant panda program,"" said Dwight Lawson, the zoo's deputy director. ""This is a joy we share with the city of Atlanta, our colleagues in China and our counterparts at fellow zoological organizations housing giant pandas in the U.S."" Zoo Atlanta called the birth ""a significant achievement for global efforts to save a critically endangered species."" Fewer than 1,600 giant pandas are estimated to remain in the wild, and about 280 reside in zoos -- 11 of them in the United States. Before the cub makes its public debut, images will be available at the zoo's panda conservation center and on its ""PandaCam,"" accessible online. Lun Lun and Yang Yang were born in China. They have lived with each other since they were a year old and came as a pair to Zoo Atlanta in 1999.","The cub was born at 5:39 a.m. ET .

"His daredevil stunts have attracted over 3.5 million hits on YouTube and reached uncharted waters for sailing, but for his next trick Alex Thomson just wants to get back to doing what he does best -- circumnavigating the globe faster than anyone else. His ""crazy ideas"" have ended up with the 40-year-old walking along the keel of his Hugo Boss yacht and then -- even more daringly -- scaling the height of its huge sail before diving into the water. Thomson was dressed for both stunts in the stylish menswear associated with his sponsor. Their longstanding relationship dates back to 2003, with Thomson having made headlines in a more conventional sporting manner through his exploits in long-distance ocean racing. As far back as 1999 he became the youngest skipper to win a round the world race, and he's a multiple record-holder for distance covered in 24 hours at sea. But perhaps the biggest prize, the Vendee Globe -- the ultimate single-handed round the world race, sailed nonstop and without assistance -- has eluded him. ""It's a supreme test of human endeavor, truly man against the elements,"" the British sailor told CNN. ""I equate it to challenging for an Olympic gold in a four-year cycle, and you must peak at the right time. ""Ben Ainslie (the four-time gold medalist from Britain in sailing) does this perfectly and I want to emulate him."" There are still two and a half years to the start of the next Vendee Globe race in Les Sables-d'Olonne in southwest France, but for Thomson it cannot come around fast enough. His 2008 challenge was ruined by a collision with a fishing boat which wrecked his preparations, and he finished third in the 2012 edition. Thomson finished just over two days behind winner Francois Gabart of France after 80 days of racing, setting a British record for a solo round the world race in the process. ""The big win has eluded me,"" he said. British ambition . Ainslie, who won his Olympic golds in dinghy classes, has announced he will lead an ambitious $134 million British bid to win the America's Cup in 2017. One of the key members of that syndicate is Keith Mills, a businessman who ran Britain's successful bid for the London 2012 Olympics and is a co-founder of the Alex Thomson Racing team. The planning required for the America's Cup is on a similar scale to the Vendee -- but instead of being part of a big crew, Thompson will be on his own as he negotiates his way around dangerous oceans at the helm of a 10-ton, 60-foot yacht. ""The boats are absolute beasts with a sail area of three tennis courts alone,"" said the Welshman, who was born in the coastal town of Bangor. ""It very much depends whether you are physically fit enough to do this kind of thing."" His eponymous team's current boat successfully competed in long-distance events under previous owners, winning the 2010-11 Barcelona World Race. It has been extensively refitted and a new keel added to keep pace with the opposition. ""It's like Formula One, with thousands of things to do and test,"" said Thompson in equating the scale of the challenge. Unlike F1, the chance to test equipment in race conditions is limited -- ""and we don't have the budgets of the likes of Ferrari."" Although 2016 appears a long way off, the team have to make the most of the opportunities. ""We have two or three big events and about 20,000 individual components that can go wrong,"" Thomson admitted. Family commitment . He had to sit out one of those events -- the IMOCA Ocean Masters race from New York to Barcelona  -- because his wife was due to give birth to their second child. Georgia, weighing in at seven pounds seven ounces, was indeed born at a time when a less attentive father might have been mid-Atlantic. But the race provided a welcome boost for Thomson's long-term aspirations as Spaniard Pepe Ribes and his replacement -- American Ryan Breymaier -- took line honors after just over 14 days at sea. They took advantage when an accident on board rival Safran meant the race leader had to stop in Cadiz so one of its skippers could get medical treatment. While not a serious injury, it was a painful reminder of the inherent dangers in ocean racing. ""The Atlantic is as dangerous as any place, particularly in the spring and winter,"" Thomson said. He will pair with Ribes for the 2014-15 edition of the Barcelona World Race, which starts on New Year's Eve from the Catalan city and will finish in its port by the end of March 2015. Then it will be back to fine-tuning for the Vendee Globe, where victory and the likely chance of being crowned winner of the IMOCA Ocean Masters World Championship is firmly in his sights. And, as for any more eye-catching stunts, Thomson is keeping his cards close to his chest. ""We usually do them around September and it takes a fair bit of planning,"" he revealed. ""Perhaps the most important thing is that it showcases our sport to people who don't sail and maybe we can tempt people to take it up.""","Alex Thomson renowned for his daredevil yachting stunts .

"After promising a ""day of retribution"" on YouTube, a heavily armed, mentally disturbed 22-year-old went on a killing spree in a California college town, authorities said. He fatally stabbed three men in his residence, shot two women to death in front of a sorority house, shot a man to death inside a deli, exchanged gunfire twice with police and injured 13 people as he drove from block to block, the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office said Saturday night. Elliot Rodger, 22, ended the Friday night rampage near the University of California, Santa Barbara, apparently by fatally shooting himself in the head while sitting behind the wheel of his wrecked BMW, Sheriff Bill Brown said. Inside the car, police found three handguns -- all legally purchased -- and more than 400 rounds of unused ammunition, Brown said at a Saturday evening press conference. The suspect formerly was a student at Santa Barbara City College and lived in Isla Vista, where the rampage occurred. His father, Peter Rodger, works in the film industry and was the second unit assistant director on the first ""The Hunger Games"" film, according to a spokeswoman for Lionsgate. The younger Rodger apparently telegraphed his intentions. The day before the rampage, he released a YouTube video entitled ""Retribution,"" in which he rants about women who ignored or rejected him over the past eight years, ""since I hit puberty."" ""Tomorrow is the day of retribution, the day in which I will have my revenge,"" he says on the video. ""You girls have never been attracted to me. I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it."" He specifically criticized sorority members. Rodger appears to have further chronicled his rage in a 140-page account of his life that begins with his birth and ends with what he describes as ""the Day of Retribution."" The document, titled ""My Twisted World,"" was obtained by CNN affiliate KEYT. ""It was apparent he was very mentally disturbed,"" Brown said. Transcript of the chilling video . So disturbed that a family member asked law enforcement officers to check on his welfare April 30, Brown said. They went to his residence, found Rodger ""polite and courteous,"" and left, Brown said. The rampage left six dead and 13 hurt, with eight suffering gunshot wounds, four hit by the suspect's vehicle and one suffering a minor injury ""of unknown origin,"" Brown said. At the press conference, Dr. Stephen Kaminski, trauma services director for Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, gave this account of 11 of the wounded: four treated and released, and seven transferred to Cottage Hospital. Of those seven, two were in good condition, three fair and two serious, he said. Brown provided this sequence to the violence, which occurred in a crowded area bustling with activity on Memorial Day weekend. The action covered so much ground that officers worked 12 different crime scenes. Spree apparently began with stabbings . First, three men were ""repeatedly stabbed"" and killed inside Rodger's residence. They weren't identified. Next, members of the Alpha Phi sorority in Isla Vista reported hearing loud knocking on the front door for several minutes. Nobody answered. Several minutes later, witnesses saw three women in front of the sorority house shot by a man from across the street. Two were killed, one wounded.  All were UC Santa Barbara students. Rodger drove his black BMW several blocks, went into a delicatessen and shot Christoper Martinez to death, officials said. Martinez was a UC Santa Barbara student. While driving around, sometimes on the wrong side of the street, Rodger shot at pedestrians on the sidewalk, authorities said. He encountered a sheriff's deputy who was on foot and exchanged gunfire. He kept driving and hit a bicyclist, authorities said. He shot more pedestrians on the sidewalk. He encountered four deputies on foot near a park and they exchanged gunfire. Rodger may have been hit in the hip. He drove away at a high rate of speed and hit another cyclist, who tumbled over the car's hood and hit the windshield. The BMW collided with other cars and came to a stop. Officers approached the car and found Rodger dead of a gunshot wound to the head. ""It would appear he took his own life,"" Brown said. One family is speaking out in anger. Richard Martinez, father of Christopher Martinez, said to reporters. ""Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA. They talk about gun rights, what about Chris' right to live? When will this insanity stop?"" A law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN that Elliot Rodger passed the background check needed to buy the firearm used in the shooting. The official says nothing has been found in the gun trace to indicate Rodger shouldn't have qualified to buy a gun. Rodger had three previous contacts with authorities, the sheriff said. On July 21, 2013, he talked to officers at the hospital, saying he'd been the victim of an assault. Officers thought he might have been the aggressor, Brown said. On January 15, he called to complain a roommate had stolen three candles worth $22. Rodger later made a citizen's arrest on the roommate for petty theft and the case was referred to the district attorney for prosecution, Brown said. And, finally, the April 30 check at the request of a family member. Who's the man behind the rampage . A life-and-death situation . The outburst of violence left students and residents stunned. Kyle Sullivan, 19, a student at Santa Barbara City College, said he came upon three young women -- all shot -- on a lawn in front of the Alpha Phi sorority. One woman appeared to be dead. Another was struggling and ""just barely able to move her eyes,"" he said. A third, with a kidney wound, was on the phone with her mother, saying she probably wasn't going to make and ""how much she loved her,"" Sullivan said. ""I really wasn't able to sleep at all,"" Sullivan told CNN. ""It was heartbreaking that something would happen in our community like this."" The names of those women have not not released.  Alphi Phi posted on its Facebook page Saturday that ""all our members are safe."" Nikolaus Becker, a high school senior visiting Isla Vista, was eating a burger in a restaurant with friends. They heard pops and thought fireworks. Some students were doing homework. Not town's first mass killing . ""We were actually joking around about it,"" he said of the crackling sound. ""People were riding their bikes around outside, and parties were still going on."" Then Becker and friends heard two more sets of bangs.  Police were running. A speeding car -- moving at least 50 mph -- screeched around a corner. When Becker finally went outside a half hour later, he saw body bags on the street. One victim, Nick Pasichuke, told CNN he was struck by the gunman's car. ""There are six other people currently hospitalized with me right now. ... There was a guy driving a BMW.  I was on a long board and he aimed his car at our group of friends and gunned it into us. I have two broken legs and need surgery. The police said I flew roughly 50 feet into a busy intersection. This is all so crazy."" Ian Papa said he was inches away on the street when the gunman's car sped up and struck two bicyclists. ""It happened so fast,"" he said. ""I had no time to react. I jumped on the sidewalk and I see a man on a BMW, his body inside the windshield and glass broken everywhere ...  I almost wanted to break into tears. It was a life and death situation. Gunman talked to victims . The violence began and ended within minutes, from 9:27 p.m. when shots were reported to around 10 minutes later when police discovered the body of the suspected gunman, CNN affiliate KEYT-TV said. Authorities said there were nine separate crime scenes. U.S. law enforcement officials said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and FBI were assisting local police in the investigation, including trying to trace the handgun used and where the suspect obtained it. Agents were on the scene to offer firearms expertise in tracing all details about the weapon using ATF's National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, according to the agency. Worst U.S. mass shootings . KEYT reporter John Palminteri told CNN that some witnesses reported hearing the gunman talk to some of his victims as he fired. Outside a 7-11 convenience store, he said, workers came out amid the gunfire to pull to safety a girl who had been shot in the leg. Beachfront college town of Isla Vista has seen mass killing before . 'No words to express the sadness' In a statement on its website Saturday, UC Santa Barbara said several students were taken to local hospitals after the shooting. ""Our hearts and prayers go out to the family and friends of those affected,"" the statement said. Santa Barbara City College also reacted Saturday. ""There are no words to express the sadness we have for the victims and their families and for all the residents of Isla Vista,"" the statement said. ""We know our students co-mingle with UCSB students and Isla Vista residents as part of our greater community and we all, as an extended family, are impacted by this unimaginable event."" Elliot Rodger's family also gave their condolences, spoken through their attorney: ""The Rodger's family offers their deepest compassion and sympathy to the families involved in this terrible tragedy. We are experiencing the most inconceivable pain and our hearts go out to everybody involved.""

"(CNN) -- Notorious serial killer Ted Bundy confessed to more than 30 murders before he was sent to Florida's electric chair in 1989, but experts have always believed there were more. Now, investigators across the country are hoping a vial of Bundy's blood -- kept as part of a case record -- will prove or disprove his involvement in cold cases dating as far back as 1961. Bundy's blood, recovered from an evidence lab in Columbia County, Florida, will be entered into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) on Friday. Investigators say it's a major milestone in a decades-long search for evidence to complete the killer's profile. A reopened 1961 cold case involving a missing 8-year-old girl in Tacoma, Washington, was the impetus for the completed DNA profile. The girl lived along a newspaper route that the then-teenager Bundy worked, according to published accounts. Washington state homicide detective Lindsey Wade said her department, which has long suspected a connection between Bundy and Ann Marie Burr, contacted the Florida Department of Law Enforcement in search of a profile that could provide the needed link. ""A profile will assist with whatever evidence you have,"" said Keith Kameg, spokesman for the department. ""It doesn't mean someone did it, but it does mean they were there."" Kameg's department contacted law enforcement agencies across the state seeking any evidence that could be used to build a profile on Bundy. A vial of Bundy's blood was recovered from the Columbia County Sheriff's Office, and though blood samples degrade over time, Kameg said the department was able to build a profile from that sample. Bundy was put to death in January 1989, convicted in two trials of three Florida murders. He had prolonged his life by confessing to other murders in other states and was suspected in many more killings. However, he adamantly denied having anything to do with the death of Ann Marie Burr. Criminal profiler Pat Brown of Washington, D.C., who has written extensively about Bundy, said though Bundy appeared on numerous suspect lists, his killing spree was able to last for years because detectives thought he didn't fit the profile of a typical serial killer. At the height of his killing spree in the 1970s, Bundy would feign a broken arm or leg and ask young women for help -- luring the victims he would later murder. At the time of Bundy's convictions, DNA typing was not widely used, but advances in the forensics field have revitalized efforts to link serial killers to unsolved crimes. ""The technology in the past 25 years went from archaic to phenomenal,"" Kameg said. Though Bundy is long gone, Kameg said, his DNA profile could answer lingering questions for police and bring comfort to loved ones. CNN's sister network truTV contributed to this report.","Forensic analysts are building a DNA profile of Ted Bundy .

"I never realized that the conservative media were so eye-poppingly powerful. So mighty, in fact, that liberal politicians can't seem to stop talking about how they are running roughshod over the country. My response: Can we please stop the whining? The latest to rant about the right is Al Gore. The former vice president told Charlie Rose that President Barack Obama had been cautious, and when the CBS anchor asked whether there was ""a very hostile environment for progressive ideas,"" Gore had his culprit ready: . ""Fox News and right-wing talk radio. In Tennessee there's an old saying if you see a turtle on a fence post you can be pretty sure it didn't get there by itself. And the fact that we have 24/7 propaganda masquerading as news, it does have an impact."" Watch: Why Geraldo Rivera's Senate hopes are an empty vault . OK, Gore doesn't like Fox. So he started what he hoped would be a liberal counterweight in Current TV, spent millions on such stars as Keith Olbermann, and ... the channel flopped. It was such a failure that he just sold it to Al Jazeera  for an estimated personal take of $100 million. Leave aside the obvious contradiction of a climate change crusader selling to a network largely financed by the petrodollar kingdom of Qatar. Whatever you think of Fox, Rupert Murdoch's network has been a financial success and Current TV was anything but. Isn't that the free market at work? Watch: The media's gushing send-off for Hillary Clinton . Obama often invokes the conservative media, most recently in an interview with The New Republic. Asked about working with Republicans in his second term, the president said: ""One of the biggest factors is going to be how the media shapes debates. If a Republican member of Congress is not punished on Fox News or by Rush Limbaugh for working with a Democrat on a bill of common interest, then you'll see more of them doing it."" Now it's true that Fox or Limbaugh can boost or batter any lawmaker, and that they can help drive a controversy into the broader mainstream media. But we're talking here about the president of the United States. He has an army, a navy and a bunch of nuclear weapons, not to mention an ability to command the airwaves at a moment's notice. And he's complaining about a cable channel and a radio talk-show host? Limbaugh later offered this response: ""If Fox News and I are the only thing keeping the Republicans from caving to Barack Obama on every issue, I'm not paid enough."" Watch: Does Sarah Palin have a future after Fox? I have been through this before. It was on my ""Reliable Sources"" program, in the fall of 2009, that the White House declared war on Fox News. Anita Dunn, then the White House communications director, called Fox ""the communications arm of the Republican Party"" and said, ""It is not really a news network anymore."" The resulting furor gave Fox months of fodder and was widely judged a tactical misstep that if anything elevated the network's role. There are times when many Fox programs, including in the nonopinion hours, appear to be on a jihad against the administration. And these days, MSNBC can be counted on to defend the Democrats almost around the clock. But let's face it: These are cable channels with relatively modest audiences, and their impact is sometimes exaggerated inside the Beltway echo chamber. After all, Obama handily won re-election despite the best efforts of Sean Hannity and Limbaugh. Watch: New York Times censors company's vulgar name . What liberals sometimes forget is that the conservative media took root because many Americans felt the fourth estate was too left-wing. ABC, NBC, CBS, NPR, The New York Times and The Washington Post all strive for fairness, in my view, but there is little question that they have a social and cultural outlook that leans to the left. Collectively, they have far more weight than Fox, talk radio and The Wall Street Journal editorial page. Right-wing pundits make a convenient foil, but at times Obama seems to magnify their importance. After all, he's got the biggest bully pulpit of all.","Al Gore says right-wing media help account for resistance to Democrats' policies .

"(CNN)Recently, my younger daughter left her class project, a time capsule, at the door so I would see it the minute I got home. Her project wasn't due for a month, and she took it upon herself to start it and finish it. I beamed at her great work ethic. If the story ended here, I would proudly say I am one of those parents who is totally comfortable with the whole ""letting my kids fail"" concept, but alas, there is more. You see, even though my daughter worked hard to create a unique time capsule -- complete with a slipper, miniature soccer and basketball, chess set, Pokemon cards and cordless phone -- I worried that the other kids, probably with help from their parents, would have much more elaborate and highly constructed time capsules. Plus, I thought my daughter didn't quite complete the assignment. She wanted to bring the project in the following morning. ""I put my heart into it,"" she told me. 'Brutally Honest': Is it OK to spy on your kids? No-brainer, right? But no, I was torn between not wanting to crush her spirit and making sure her project was viewed positively by her teacher and peers. I think you can probably guess which feeling won out. She brought the project in after the weekend -- and only after I had her re-read the assignment and add decorations and information. There is no doubt in my mind she was prouder of her work before I meddled. Why on earth did I do such a thing? Many of us good, well-meaning parents are scared of our children ""not being right all the time"" and are motivated by a desire to buck up our kids' self-esteem when we're actually doing more harm than good, according to Jessica Lahey, author of the upcoming book ""The Gift of Failure: How the Best Parents Learn to Let Go So Their Children Can Succeed,"" which will be released in August. Lahey, who has spent more than a decade teaching middle and high school students, has become somewhat of an expert in this area, after her article ""Why Parents Need to Let Their Children Fail"" in The Atlantic back in January 2013 went viral. 'Brutally Honest': Is it OK to be naked in front of your kids? The article included an unforgettable anecdote: Lahey called a parent to inform her that her child would be punished for plagiarism only to learn from the mother that she, not her daughter, wrote the entire paper. Sure, an extreme case, but an example of what many parents do, thinking they are actually helping their children. ""Every single time we turn around and say, 'I'll just do that for you' or 'Here let me help you with that,' we are saying to them, 'I don't think you can do that for yourself,' "" said Lahey, who is also a columnist for The New York Times and a contributor to The Atlantic and Vermont Public Radio. ""And that is really damaging over time. We create a really helpless culture of kids so that now when I talk to college professors, they say these kids show up to college unable to handle anything on their own."" The research backs up just how dangerous our inability to let our children stumble and figure things out on their own can be for them as young adults. A 2013 study in the Journal of Child and Family Studies found that helicopter parenting can lead to anxiety and depression in college students, and decreased feelings of autonomy and competence. 'Brutally Honest': When is to OK to leave your teen home alone overnight? Another investigation, this one led by the University of Arizona, found that adults who were overparented have an exaggerated sense of entitlement, and more doubt about their ability to overcome challenges. The study also found that helicopter parents have dependent and neurotic kids. Why do we do it? Part of the reason we step in, says Lahey, is because we want our kids to love us. ""We want to feel needed and so when we take that homework assignment to school for them and rescue them, we feel we get to check that box off today. 'I was a good parent,'"" said Lahey. She writes in the book about her own struggles, how one morning, her younger child, who is now 11, worked really hard on his homework assignment and then left it on the coffee table. ""And I took to Facebook (and wrote) 'Just for those of you who think this is easy for me, that homework assignment is sitting there on the table.'"" 'Brutally Honest': What if you don't like your kids' friends? She did not take the homework to school, as at least one member of her Facebook community suggested she do, and was on ""tenterhooks"" all day, she said. ""But he came home at the end of the day and he's like, 'It's fine. I talked to my teacher,'"" said Lahey. ""Giving kids the opportunity to problem solve when something goes wrong, there's nothing better than that and when we take that away from them, it's a real tragedy."" 'Brutally Honest': Mean girls are getting younger . Debate over what 'fail' means . In conversations with parents across the country, there was definite disagreement over just what letting a child fail means and just how far a parent can take it. ""I think when you use the word 'fail' you alienate a lot of people,"" said the children's television host Miss Lori, a mom of three. ""I believe in allowing my children to stumble."" Teaching them how to get up again is enormously important, said the social media strategist and Babble.com contributor. ""But fail, not so much, especially in school. Our education system is already failing them in most cities. Their school resume is too important and they have too few years to amass it."" Allowing kids to ""fail"" has different meanings to parents, says Vicki Hoefle, author of ""Duct Tape Parenting: A Less is More Approach to Raising Respectful, Responsible, and Resilient Kids."" ""And this is where some of the confusion comes in. Allowing your first-grader to fail a spelling test because they did study is much easier for a parent to deal with than allowing your eight-grader to fail science because he chose not to study and will have to repeat the class over the summer,"" said Hoefle, whose newest book, ""The Straight Talk on Parenting,"" will be released in April. Why Facebook parenting can backfire . Balance is key, says Avital Norman Nathman, a mom of an 8-year-old in Northhampton, Massachusetts, who blogs at The Mamafesto. We shouldn't always let our kids ""hang out to dry,"" but we also need to realize part of our desire to see our kids succeed is our own ego. ""We see our successes in our own children so when we allow them to fail, that also kind of reflects on us ... and so it's uncomfortable but we need to get there because otherwise we're going to have these helpless kids who either feel incredibly entitled and who would want that, or helpless, they don't know how to do things for themselves,"" said Norman Nathman, editor of the motherhood anthology ""The Good Mother Myth: Redefining Motherhood to Fit Reality."" If we're hurting our kids, how do we stop doing it? In many ways, it's so much easier not to let our kids fail, parents say. Cecily Kellogg of Philadelphia remembers when her 8-year-old joined their local Junior Roller Derby team. In the middle of the first practice, she skated over to her mom shaking and crying because she felt she was slower than everyone and didn't know the moves. She wanted to leave immediately, but her mom refused to take her home. Her daughter was clinging to her, but Kellogg pried herself away and left her to her coaches. The next practice her daughter still felt embarrassed and ashamed she wasn't an expert but agreed to go inside the rink only after her mother left. ""Boy oh boy, did I want her to quit. Both times I walked away from her, it was one of the hardest things I've ever done,"" said Kellogg. ""Now? She's absolutely crazy about roller derby and loves it. Can't wait to go each week."" Kellogg says the experience was not just about allowing her daughter to ""fail"" and learning the ""hard way she wasn't going to be the very best at what she did without practice."" It was also about ""pushing her to keep going without letting her quit."" Lahey says her biggest piece of advice for parents is to move away from any focus on the end results, namely grades and test scores. Let your kids make up their short-term goals, she suggests, which could include everything from making more friends at school to cleaning their room seven days in a row to making the roller derby team. ""If ... they don't achieve them, that's OK, yes, they failed at something. They failed to achieve their goals, but what are the consequences? It's nothing.""

"Starting the day off at the beach with your skin smelling of tropical-scented sunscreen can be one of life's greatest pleasures. Smelling coconut oil as you swish it around in your mouth before work -- well, that's another story. Oil pulling, or placing oil in the mouth to kill harmful bacteria, seems to have caught on recently. It's a controversial practice that takes dedication and time, though fortunately not the 10 or 20 minutes of marathon swishing some sources suggest. Two sessions of four minutes, as recommended by Dr. Amala Guha, assistant professor of immunology and medicine at the University of Connecticut Health Center and the founding president of The International Society for Ayurveda and Health, were sufficient for my first attempt at oil pulling. The taste itself isn't so bad on the surface, but putting chunky coconut oil in your mouth before being fully awake can trigger a gag reflex. Luckily, the time goes by quickly, and afterward I admit my teeth felt polished throughout the day, as if I'd just come from the dentist. But what's the scope (and scoop) on this mouth rinse practice? Does it work? ""It's not given proper credit,"" said Guha, who was trained in Ayurveda, a traditional form of medicine that relies on natural healing, in India. She explains that using liquids in the mouth for health purposes is mentioned in two ancient Indian Ayurvedic texts (one written in 800 B.C. and the other in 700 B.C.), and the practice is part of one of the oldest health systems in the world. Oil pulling for oral hygiene is common. But before you go racing out to the store for oil, the American Dental Association cautions that because of a lack of evidence, they do not recommend oil pulling as a replacement for standard oral health care such as flossing and teeth brushing. The texts also claim that about 30 systemic diseases, including headaches and diabetes, can be cured. Yet there is a lack of knowledge on the science and side effects behind the practice, according to Guha. How it works . Guha says there are two oil pulling techniques: kavala and gandusa. With kavala, you fill your mouth with liquid and hold it there for a couple of minutes before swirling it around the mouth and spitting it out. The process shouldn't exceed more than three or four minutes; it's repeated at least two or three times. Gandusa is the technique of holding the liquid still in the mouth for three to five minutes. The liquid is then spit out and the process is repeated. In Ayurveda, many different liquids can be used depending on the condition being treated and the physiology of the person. Milk, honey and hot water containing herbs are just some of the other mediums, explains Guha. For daily oral hygiene, she recommends using coconut or sesame oil, which she says have mild abrasive powers and more healing benefits than other oils (and are less harmful). Results can be expected in a few months, she says, with benefits such as reduced plaque, cavity prevention and stronger gums for individuals who already have a healthy mouth. For the person with plaque buildup, she recommends a teeth cleaning first for faster results. A small study published in 2009 involving sesame oil and 20 adolescent boys with plaque-induced gingivitis found that oil pulling reduced plaque and the bacterium Streptococcus mutans. This bacterium is cited as being a major cause of tooth decay and overgrowth of bacteria in mouth can also lead to gum disease. A larger study published in 2013, also using sesame oil, found similar results, summarizing that oil pulling had a significant effect on plaque and gingivitis. For coconut oil users, lauric acid found in the oil can be a benefit. It is known for its antimicrobial properties, such as the ability to fight off viruses, bacteria and yeasts. How it doesn't work . Mark Wolff, professor and chair at the New York University College of Dentistry, expresses skepticism about oil pulling's effects on oral health. ""I am not sure there is any harm, but I have never seen it have any positive effect on my patients who have been using oil pulling or in clinical research that has been published."" There is also little research available on the effectiveness of these treatments to cure other diseases. Guha warns that there can be negative side effects if improper technique is used, including dry mouth, excessive thirst, muscular stiffness, exhaustion and loss of sensation or taste in the mouth. Individuals who are interested in trying kavala or gandusa to treat health conditions need to review all credentials of Ayruvedic practitioners before starting any treatment. Guha says that there are very few trained professionals in the United States as none of the Ayurveda schools here are accredited; only schools in India provide the proper certifications. Bottom line? If you're just looking for a natural way to boost your oral health, you can oil away without supervision and get about the same benefits as commercial mouthwash. Just don't forget to floss.","Oil pulling is based on ancient Indian health systems .

"One of the world's oldest civilizations took a major step toward democracy Wednesday as polls closed in Egypt's historic vote for president, even as many worried the armed forces would quash the results if the top brass doesn't like the country's choice. It is the first time the country has had a presidential election where no one knows what the result will be before the ballots are cast. ""Finally, Egypt is born,"" one weeping 80-year-old man told Rep. David Dreier, a California Republican who is in Cairo as an election observer. Zakaria: Is Egypt ready? Grandmother Nadia Fahmy, 70, was so determined to be the first one to vote at her polling station that she camped out in a plastic chair for 2½ hours before it opened. ""I am here to vote for the first time in my life,"" said Fahmy.  ""I want to see a new generation for my country. I want everything to change."" Other people told CNN they had waited up to four hours to vote as an atmosphere of enthusiasm swept polling stations in the capital. Egypt elections: 'Women need a champion' The voting is a monumental achievement for those who worked to topple longtime President Hosni Mubarak in one of the seminal developments of the Arab Spring more than a year ago. And it could reverberate far beyond the country's borders, since Egypt is in many ways the center of gravity of the Arab world. Egyptian police officers convicted of murder in protest crackdown . ""Egypt has always set trends in the Arab world and for Arab political thought. Trends spread through the Arab world and eventually affect even non-Arab, Muslim-majority countries,"" said Maajid Nawaz, the chairman of Quilliam, a London-based think tank. Egypt's election ""bodes well for the rest of the Arab world and particularly those countries that have had uprisings,"" said Nawaz, a former Islamist who was imprisoned in Egypt for four years for banned political activism. There are 13 candidates on the ballot, although two withdrew from the race after ballots were printed. If no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the first round, a second round will be held June 16-17. Results of the first round are not expected before the weekend. Some 30,000 volunteers have fanned out to make sure the voting is fair, said organizers with the April 6 youth movement, which has long campaigned for greater democracy and rule of law in Egypt. They reported only minor violations Wednesday, mostly supporters of one candidate or another trying to influence voters at polling stations. There is a pervasive fear that the powerful military, which has run the country since the fall of Mubarak, could try to hijack the election. Egypt's revolution: 'We fell in love, but it was a trick' The concern persists despite the insistence of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces that it will hand over power to an elected civilian government. The military put armored personnel carriers on the streets with loudspeakers broadcasting a message that they will relinquish power, but that did not convince doubters. Nawaz, the analyst in London, said Egypt probably is not heading toward a simple case of the military either giving up control or rejecting the results of the election. Instead, he anticipated, there will be an ""unhappy settlement"" where the military remains ""ever-present, in the shadows,"" influencing the civilian government without controlling it. Old politics joins new in Egypt . ""Egypt is going along similar lines to Turkey or Pakistan,"" he said, naming two other countries that have formal democracies in place but where a powerful military can affect events. The degree to which the military continues to exercise control in Egypt will depend on who wins the election, Nawaz anticipated -- but he  laughed aloud when asked to predict who that would be. Whoever wins the election, Nawaz said, will face tremendous challenges, even without worries about the army. ""They are inheriting a failed economy, an abysmal bureaucracy, a frustrated people, and a deep distrust on behalf of the people towards their military and any policing,"" Nawaz said. And Egypt has an elaborate political mosaic where alliances shift quickly, he added. Secular democrats oppose military rule, for example, but if an Islamist candidate wins the presidency, ""Some of the democrats would switch because they would rather have military rule than the Islamists,"" Nawaz said. Opinion: Egypt's military must stop torturing detainees . ""It's far more complicated than 'Islamists vs. liberal democracy.' It's rich vs. poor, (hardline) Salafists vs. the (more moderate) Muslim Brotherhood, secularists vs. Islamists,"" he said. On top of that, the country does not yet have a new constitution defining the powers of the president or the parliament, after a court last month suspended the committee charged with writing it. The court ruled that the members of the committee did not reflect the national population well enough. Among the candidates vying for the presidency are Mohamed Morsi, of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party; Amre Moussa, who served as foreign minister under Mubarak and headed the Arab League; Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh, a moderate Islamist running as a respected independent; Ahmed Shafik, who was Mubarak's last prime minister; and Hamdeen Sabahy, a leftist dark-horse contender. Shafik was mobbed by opponents who threw things at him when he went to vote Wednesday, his spokesman, Ahmed Serhan, told CNN. ""People chanted against him upon his entrance to cast his vote,"" Serhan said. That prompted soldiers guarding the polling station to shut the doors while Shafik voted, he said. ""On his way out, some people threw their shoes and rocks at him while he rushed into the car,"" Serhan said. ""He is not hurt, and this attack is not representative of how Egyptian people feel about him."" Many Egyptians seem uncertain of their loyalties to any particular candidate, and even the weakest of arguments or the strangest of rumors can shift public opinion overnight. The vote comes nearly 16 months after the popular uprising that brought down Mubarak in February 2011. Mubarak was tried on charges of ordering police to shoot protesters during the uprising against him, and of corruption. He is awaiting the court's verdict and could potentially face the death penalty. Despite the high-profile trial of the man who ruled the country for 30 years, popular distrust and anger, particularly against the military's power in Egyptian governmental affairs, still inspire protests, some of which have been marked by deadly clashes. Protesters are upset at what they see as the slow pace of reform since Mubarak's ouster. Some are also concerned that the country's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule. In January, two Islamist parties won about 70% of the seats in the lower house of parliament in the first elections for an elected governing body in the post-Mubarak era. The Freedom and Justice Party won 235 seats and the conservative Al Nour party gained 121 seats in the People's Assembly, according to final results. The assembly consists of 498 elected members, and the rest of the seats were divided among other parties.","Polls closed in Egypt's historic vote for president .

"A nurse at the hospital who was duped by a prank call from two Australian radio DJs concerning Prince William's pregnant wife, Catherine, has apparently committed suicide, the hospital confirmed Friday. The nurse ""was recently the victim of a hoax call,"" King Edward VII Hospital said in a media statement. The DJs impersonated Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles in the prank call, in which some details of the Duchess of Cambridge's condition and care were given. Read more: Opinion: How will royal couple react to pregnancy prank? The nurse who died was the person who first took the hoax call and transferred it through to Catherine's ward, the hospital's public relations company said. The hospital named her as Jacintha Saldanha and said she had worked there for more than four years as an ""excellent nurse,"" well-respected by co-workers. The hospital ""had been supporting her throughout this difficult time,"" the statement said. She is survived by her husband and two children, the hospital said. Her family released a statement asking for privacy and directing questions to police. Social media entwined in radio prank, suicide story . ""We as a family are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved Jacintha,"" said the statement, released by police. As the hoax controversy unfolded, authorities weren't releasing to British media the name of the nurse victimized in the prank. Her name became public only after her death. The Duchess of Cambridge was discharged from the hospital Thursday after treatment for acute morning sickness. A St. James's Palace spokesman said: ""The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are deeply saddened to learn of the death of Jacintha Saldanha. ""Their Royal Highnesses were looked after so wonderfully well at all times by everybody at King Edward VII Hospital, and their thoughts and prayers are with Jacintha Saldanha's family, friends and colleagues at this very sad time."" Separately, a palace spokesman told CNN: ""At no point did the palace complain to the hospital about the incident. On the contrary, we offered our full and heartfelt support to the nurses involved and hospital staff at all times."" The hospital's chief executive, John Lofthouse, said, ""Everyone is shocked by the loss of a much loved and valued colleague."" London's Metropolitan Police said they were notified around 9:35 a.m. (4:35 a.m. ET) on Friday that a woman was found unconscious. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Police are treating the death as ""unexplained,"" they said. Audio of the call posted online suggested a woman spoke briefly to the DJs, who host a show for the 2Day FM radio station in Sydney, before the call was put through to the ward early Tuesday morning. The hospital said Wednesday that it deeply regretted the call had been put through. The hospital is known for treating royals. In June, Prince Philip, 91, was admitted to the same hospital with a bladder infection, forcing him to miss part of the queen's Diamond Jubilee celebration. Read more: Radio DJs pretend to be queen, make prank call to Catherine's hospital . The radio show apologized for the call Wednesday, saying it ""was done with light-hearted intentions."" The show was known for its irreverent humor, aimed at a young, mainly female demographic. The hosts were devoted to gossip and pranks. Its two DJs, Mel Greig and Michael Christian, continued to tweet about the call on Thursday and earlier Friday, promising ""more on the #royalprank."" Talking about the call on air Thursday, Greig said: ""They were the world's worst accents ever. We were sure 100 people at least before us would've tried the same thing. ... We were expecting to be hung up on -- we didn't even know what to say when we got through."" Some listeners applauded the prank, like one who identified himself as Guido on the station's Facebook page and wrote, ""It is only a joke people! it was great i love it!!!"" Others were outraged, with such negative views outnumbering positive ones on 2DayFM's before the nurse's death. ""Your stunt was done at a time in this country where there is paranoia about the intrusion of the media into people's lives,"" Gary Slenders wrote. ""I know you will say it is harmless fun, the management of 2DayFM will say that it won't happen again, but this exactly where the phone hacking scandal started."" The outcry grew exponentially after Saldanha's death, leading the Coles supermarket chain to remove all its advertising from 2Day FM in response. By Friday evening, a spokeswoman for the station told CNN in a statement that the pair will ""not return to the show until further notice out of respect for what can only be described as a tragedy."" She said Greig and Christian -- whose Twitter accounts have been taken down -- were ""deeply shocked"" by the incident. Rhys Holleran, CEO of the Southern Cross Austereo media group, echoed those facts and views in a press conference Saturday afternoon, saying the company and DJs ""mutually decided"" they would be off the air for an undetermined period. Holleran said he'd spoken with Greig and Christian on Saturday morning, and they were ""deeply shattered"" and ""our concern is for their welfare."" The CEO added that he is ""very confident that we haven't done anything illegal."" ""This is a tragic event that could not have been reasonably foreseen and we are deeply saddened by it,"" he said of Saldanha's death. That view isn't shared by everyone. 2Day FM's Facebook page, for instance, contained a number of angry comments after news of the nurse's death broke. ""This death is on your conscience,"" reads one post. Another says, ""Blood on your hands."" A person using the name Riz wrote, ""This pair have undone all the good work Australia have done in the last century. The Australian people should be outraged at the pair of them. ""They've brought disgrace on your country - and the whole world knows it!""

"NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell began with an apology. It was for his handling of the scandal surrounding Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, who has been indefinitely suspended following the release of a video that shows him knocking out his future wife with a punch. ""I didn't get it right. Simply put, we have to do better,"" Goodell said during a news conference in Manhattan on Friday. But what does that mean? And how will the NFL carry that out? Here are five takeaways from Goodell's news conference: . 1. Never considered resigning . Goodell and the NFL have been criticized  and scrutinized over the handling of the Rice case by everybody from women's rights groups to sponsors to the Obama administration. In days leading up to the news conference, calls mounted for the commissioner to step down. Goodell said it was something he never considered. ""I am focused on doing my job. I understand when people are critical of my performance, but we have work to do. I am proud of the opportunity we have to make a difference and do the right thing,"" he said. ""We've acknowledged that we need to make changes and now we have to get those changes going."" 2. Education for players, staff . Goodell announced changes to the NFL's personal conduct policy, saying all players and staff would be required to undergo training and education about how to prevent domestic violence and sexual assault. The classes are expected to begin within the next month, he said. However, Goodell provided little detail about the education and training classes other than to say the league would include experts. 3. Conduct committee . One of the chief steps being taken to address the league's handling of domestic violence and sexual abuses cases is the creation of a committee to review the NFL's personal conduct policy. Goodell said he hoped to have the committee in place by the time the Super Bowl is played on February 2, but he did not provide a timeline for the committee to make changes to the policy. The committee will include input from the NFL Players Association and experts in the prevention of domestic abuse and sexual assault. Goodell did not say whether it would include law enforcement officials or mental health care professionals. 4. What Rice said . Much of the criticism surrounding the Rice case has to do with how Goodell and the league handled the case after learning in February that the running back had knocked out his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer, in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator and dragged her out. Goodell suspended Rice without pay and fined him an additional game check for ""conduct detrimental to the NFL."" Since the video showing Rice punch Palmer was made public this month, Rice has since been indefinitely suspended. Goodell said he had not seen the video prior to its release by TMZ. During the news conference, Goodell told reporters the account provided by Rice was different than what was depicted in the video. ""I'm telling you right now it's inconsistent with what he told us,"" he said. But Goodell declined to comment further on what the player told him, citing an ongoing appeal of Rice's suspension. 5. Reevaluating how NFL gathers information . When asked why the league did not get a copy of the videotape during its initial investigation into the Rice case earlier this year, Goodell said the league's security department asked for it several times. ""We got it with one phone call,"" the TMZ reporter told him, adding that the NFL has an entire department to investigate conduct issues. Goodell did not answer, saying only he would re-evaluate how the NFL gathers information.","NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell never considered resigning .

"(CNN) -- A judge Friday upheld a Cleveland, Ohio, jury's recommendation that convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell be sentenced to death. Jurors convicted Sowell of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges, including abusing corpses and kidnapping. Wednesday, they recommended the death penalty. The convictions ended a saga that began in October 2009 with the discovery of the first two victims' remains inside Sowell's home in Cleveland. He eventually was accused of killing at least 11 women ranging in age from 25 to 52. Cuyahoga County Judge Dick Ambrose imposed the sentence Friday morning. He could have overruled jurors and imposed a life sentence. Sowell, who pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, had his eyes closed during almost all of Friday's hearing, CNN affiliates reported. He made no comment. Family members of the victims were allowed to make statements. ""Anthony, you will deal with a much higher power for the pain you have caused,"" said Donnita Carmichael, daughter of victim Tonia Carmichael. ""You are an animal and hell awaits your arrival."" Sowell's lawyers had asked for life in prison. Parole would not have been an option because Sowell, 51, is classified as a ""sexually violent predator."" During the penalty phase of his trial, Sowell said he was ""sorry."" ""I know that may not sound like much. But I truly am sorry from the bottom of my heart,"" he said. During his trial, Sowell maintained a candid banter with members of his defense team as he recounted claims of childhood abuse -- both physical and sexual. He grew up in East Cleveland, joined the Marines at age 18 and traveled to California, North Carolina and Japan, authorities said. Sowell served 15 years in prison for attempted rape before being released in 2005. People who met him after his release described him as ""a normal guy."" He was known locally for selling scrap metal. Sowell's inconspicuous two-story home sat in a dilapidated neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant. A stench hovered around the area, but no one realized it was the scent of decaying human flesh, instead assuming it was a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory. Many of Sowell's victims struggled with drug addiction at some point, and court records showed many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits. The disappearances of the women -- many of whom lived near him -- went largely unnoticed for two years, with only four women being reported missing.","NEW: ""Hell awaits your arrival,"" the daughter of one victim tells Anthony Sowell .

"Washington (CNN) -- Veteran Rep. John Boehner of Ohio became the 61st speaker of the House of Representatives Wednesday as Republicans officially took charge of the chamber for the first time in four years and dramatically changed Washington's political landscape. Democrats maintained control of the Senate for the new 112th Congress, but with a reduced majority. The change likely presages a stark ideological conflict with President Barack Obama, who is preparing to defend his legislative accomplishments of the past two years and position himself for a re-election campaign in 2012. Ninety-four new House members were sworn in Wednesday, along with 13 new senators.  The new House has the largest freshman class with no previous experience in elective office since 1948. Republicans now hold a 242-193 majority in the House.  Democrats hold at 53-47 majority in the Senate. Boehner, first elected to the House in 1990, inherited the speaker's gavel from Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California.  Boehner's rise to the top position caps a remarkable political comeback.  He was voted out of the House leadership in 1998 after Republicans unexpectedly lost seats to Democrats that year. Ten of Boehner's 11 siblings were present when he was formally sworn in by Michigan Rep. John Dingell, the longest-serving member of the House. ""Hard work and tough decisions will be required of the 112th Congress. No longer can we fall short,"" Boehner said after taking the gavel.  ""No longer can we kick the can down the road.  The people voted to end business as usual, and today we begin carrying out their instructions."" He promised minority Democrats ""an honest debate"" and ""a fair and open process."" ""There's a great deal of scar tissue that's been built up on both sides of the aisle,"" he said.  But ""we can disagree without being disagreeable."" Pelosi, before handing over the gavel, reiterated that House Democrats are prepared to work with the Republicans on proposals to help the middle class, create jobs, and cut the deficit. ""We extend the hand of friendship,"" she said.  ""But where we cannot find common ground, we must stand our ground."" She also appeared to predict a quick Democratic resurgence, promising that ""two years from now when we come together, things will be different."" The first order of business for the new House majority was passage of a new set of rules to govern the chamber.  In a nod to GOP freshmen with ties to the conservative Tea Party, all new legislation will be required to include a ""Constitutional Authority Statement,"" specifying which section of the Constitution allows for passage of the bill. The Constitution will be read aloud on the House floor on Thursday.","John Boehner is sworn in as the new House speaker in the 112th Congress .

"(CNN) -- Support for abortion rights has fallen sharply in the past year, with Americans now split roughly 50-50 between those who back legal access to abortion and those who oppose it, according to a new survey. Anti-abortion activists demonstrate on Capitol Hill in Washington in September. The findings mark a dramatic shift in public opinion, supporters of abortion rights have outnumbered opponents for many years, with one brief exception, studies have shown. But only 47 percent of Americans now feel abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a drop from 54 percent a year ago, according to the poll. Meanwhile, 45 percent say it should be illegal in all or most cases. That's up from 41 percent a year ago. Given the survey's margin of error, the two camps are statistically tied. ""These data suggest that a number of people have changed their minds in the past year,"" said Gregory Smith of the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, one of the survey's authors. It's not only one type of person or group whose opinion has changed, he said. ""There was a drop seen in many, many demographics: men and women, people with a college degree and those with less education, people with various religious backgrounds,"" he said. The only groups whose opinions on abortion did not change were African-Americans -- who tend to oppose it -- and young people and those not affiliated with any particular religion, who tend to say it should be legal, he said. ""Beyond that, this movement [was] across the board,"" he said. Anti-abortion activists welcomed the findings. ""This is great news. This poll shows that the pro-life movement is winning hearts and minds. Pro-lifers are making an effective case that all women deserve better than abortion and that every child deserves a chance to be born,"" said Cathy Ruse, the senior fellow for legal studies at the anti-abortion Family Research Council in Washington. The Rev. Flip Benham, a Dallas, Texas-based anti-abortion activist, said the survey reflected a change he had already seen taking place. ""It's something that we have known for a long, long time that's been beneath the radar,"" he said. ""The heart of America is changing and only with time do the laws reflect that change."" ""When the church will come out into the streets, we win the battle,"" said Benham, director of operations for Operation Save America. ""We have to return to the God of our founding fathers and our pilgrim fathers,"" he said. But Terry O'Neill, the president of the National Organization for Women, firmly rejects religious opposition to abortion. ""Abortion is a blessing when it is chosen freely by a woman who needs it. It is a blessing,"" she said, citing the Rev. Katherine Ragsdale, dean of the Episcopal Divinity School. O'Neill has been in that position herself, she said. ""When I was in my early 20s, I thought I needed an abortion. I was escaping a very violent marriage that lasted about eight months,"" she said. ""The young man I was married to exploded and severely battered me."" She fled to her parents' home. A month later, she began to suspect she was pregnant with her abusive husband's child. ""If I had had a baby, I would have been tied to that man for the rest of my life,"" she said. ""I didn't need the abortion, as it turned out, but if I had needed that abortion, it would have been a blessing. ""I knew I was going to become a mother, but not with that man, not with that pregnancy,"" she said. She said it was important to distinguish between people who oppose abortion and those who want it to be against the law. ""I do realize that a lot of people in this country consider themselves to be pro-life,"" she said. ""They also don't want it to be a crime for a woman to get an abortion."" Smith, the researcher, suspects the election of President Obama, a pro-choice Democrat, may be one cause of the shift in public opinion. ""Look at the timing,"" he said. ""Through October of last year, the findings were consistent, with supporters outnumbering opponents,"" he said. Pew first noticed the change in public opinion in a survey in April, and did a larger study in August to confirm it. Opponents of abortion feel more strongly about it than supporters of legal access, he said. ""Some people, particularly on the right, have become more entrenched, more certain of their own positions on abortion,"" he said. ""Conservative Republicans are more certain about the correctness of their own position and less likely to say they want to see compromise. They are concerned that Obama will go too far in supporting abortion rights as president,"" he said. ""On the left you see some relaxing of views."" But the survey also found that the number of people who felt passionately about abortion is falling. About four out of 10 people in the survey could not define Obama's position on abortion. ""That is an indicator that although opinions have moved, this issue right now is not at the top of the political debate,"" Smith said. But the subject has crept into the battle to reform America's health care system, with opponents of abortion in both parties determined to prevent federal dollars from funding abortions. Under the Hyde amendment, federal money currently can be used to pay for abortions only in case of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother. There have been at least two abortion-related slayings in the United States this year, one on each side of the debate. George Tiller, a doctor known for performing abortions, was killed in May. Tiller was shot in the head at point-blank range on May 31 as services began at Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas. Scott Roeder, a 51-year-old anti-abortion activist, is charged in Tiller's killing. He has pleaded not guilty. Anti-abortion activist Jim Pouillon, 63, was shot dead outside a school in Owosso, Michigan, on September 11. He was associated with Benham's Operation Save America. Harlan James Drake, 33, is accused of shooting him and another man in separate locations that day. Authorities do not believe that Drake knew Pouillon; only that he was offended by anti-abortion material that Pouillon had displayed across from the school all week, according to Sara Edwards of the Shiawassee County prosecutor's office. The Supreme Court, the country's main legal battleground on abortion, has ruled only once on the hot-button subject since 1992, in a close 2007 decision that upheld federal restrictions on a controversial late-term abortion procedure called ""partial birth abortion"" by its opponents. Judge Sonia Sotomayor, then a federal appeals court judge, deflected questions about abortion this summer when she faced Senate confirmation hearings for a seat on the Supreme Court. She was confirmed. The court has not announced any abortion-related cases on its 2009-2010 docket. The 1973 Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade effectively legalized abortion in the United States. In 2005, 1.21 million abortions were performed, down from 1.31 million in 2000, according to data compiled by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which aims to ""advance sexual and reproductive health worldwide through research, policy analysis and education."" About 2 percent of American women age 15-44 had an abortion in 2005, the latest year for which the institute has information. The rate has been falling gradually since 1981, when it peaked at just under 3 percent, institute figures show. The new findings come from a telephone survey of more than 4,000 adults in August 2009, conducted by the Washington-based Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life and the Pew Research Center for The People & The Press. CNN Supreme Court producer Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Americans split 50-50 on whether women should have legal access to abortion .

"(CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner's threatened lawsuit against President Obama has elicited scorn from the right and blistering attacks from the left. So why is Boehner pursuing it? Perhaps because he thinks he just might win in the end. As political stunts go, Boehner's is too transparent for my tastes. And I say this as a guy who has perpetrated some serious stunt work in my political career. Boehner's not a bad guy. One gets the sense he'd rather be sharing Marlboros and merlot with Obama than taking him to court. But he is a SINO: Speaker in Name Only. The tea party is driving the GOP train these days, which explains the frequent train wrecks. So, perhaps to appease the tea party bosses, Boehner has decided to sue the President. But appeasement never works. Highly influential conservative blogger and pundit Erick Erickson calls the Boehner lawsuit ""taxpayer-funded political theater"" and notes that some of Boehner's complaints about Obama are political, not legal or constitutional. Opinion: Boehner, do your job instead . Then there's the small problem of hypocrisy. As the progressive group Americans United for Change notes in this clever ad, Boehner has long opposed citizens' rights to sue corporations over, say, defective products or gender discrimination in the workplace. He rails against ""frivolous lawsuits"" -- until he decides to file one. A second way Boehner is being hypocritical is his support for robust executive authority when George W. Bush was exercising it. Bush issued far more executive orders than Obama, going so far as to use his executive authority to authorize waterboarding, which Sen. John McCain flatly describes as torture and a ""violation of the Geneva Conventions."" So, to be clear: Dubya uses his executive authority more often -- including to turn Americans into torturers -- and Boehner goes along. But Obama uses his executive authority to give businesses more flexibility in complying with Obamacare or to extend family leave to gay couples, and Boehner literally wants to make a federal case of it. One more sure sign that this is a political puppet show: It is not at all clear which executive actions Boehner's lawsuit would focus on, because he has not identified them, telling reporters, ""When I make that decision, I'll let you know."" Boehner: Why we must now sue the President . Now, here's the depressing part: Boehner's sue first, ask questions later strategy just might work. Not because the suit has merit but because the Supreme Court has several activist Republican justices. They recently rewrote the First Amendment to declare that corporations have souls and thus have freedom of religion. Soon, I expect them to grant sainthood to Koch Industries. Obviously, I can't get into Boehner's head. It is entirely possible that there is no grand strategy here. Perhaps his lawsuit is just one strand of a handful of spaghetti he's throwing against the wall just to get through the day and survive the latest tea party onslaught. And yet, there is a chance this one strand will stick. On the other hand, progressives would do well to assume there is a method to Boehner's madness. The court's right wing plays a long game. Perhaps realizing that shifting demographics and a divided GOP will make it difficult to put a Republican back in the White House, they may seize on Boehner's lawsuit and use it to further crimp the power of the chief executive. Unable to marshal the votes to get their legislative agenda through the Senate and unable to earn the votes to recapture the White House, it may be that the Republicans' strategy for the foreseeable future is to ignore their losses at the ballot box and leave the heavy lifting to the one place where five Republican votes can cancel out tens of millions of Americans' votes: the Supreme Court. Castellanos: Obama hasn't hit rock bottom yet .","Paul Begala: Why is Boehner suing Obama in face of criticism? Because he may win .
He sees hypocrisy in that Boehner has criticized frivolous lawsuits, backed Bush orders .

"A series of errors by pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems led to the crash of Air France Flight 447, France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis said Thursday in its final report on the disaster. The Brazil-to-France flight plunged into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, 2009, killing all 228 people on board. The report details how the pilots failed to respond effectively to problems with the plane's speed sensors or to correct its trajectory when things first started to go wrong. When ice crystals blocked the plane's pitot tubes, which are part of a system used to determine air speed, the autopilot disconnected and the pilots did not know how to react to what was happening, the report said. ""The occurrence of the failure in the context of flight in cruise completely surprised the crew of flight AF 447,"" the report said. The crew responded by over-handling the aircraft, which destabilized its flight path and caused further confusing readings, the report said. ""In the first minute after the autopilot disconnection, the failure of the attempt to understand the situation and the disruption of crew cooperation had a multiplying effect, inducing total loss of cognitive control of the situation."" The Airbus A330 went into a sustained stall, signaled by a warning message and strong buffeting of the aircraft, the report said. ""Despite these persistent symptoms, the crew never understood they were in a stall situation and therefore never undertook any recovery maneuvers."" The pilots responded to the situation by pointing the nose upward, rather than downward, to recover. The report makes 25 new safety recommendations, on top of a number made in an initial report last year. Some of the recommendations have already been implemented, but it could take years for others fully to come into effect, chief investigator Alain Bouillard told reporters as he introduced the report. Opinion: Why do planes still crash? The international aeronautic community will likely focus on the crew's loss of awareness of what was going on, Bouillard said. The use of automatic systems on planes has improved safety overall, he explained, but ""when it comes down to it, safety will always be based on the capacity of the pilots and the signals which they are given, which they have to understand and react to."" It was an ""exceptional"" inquiry because of the scale of the disaster, the number of countries involved and the difficulty of locating the plane's data recorders, he said. The intense media coverage of the crash added to the pressure, Bouillard said. It's a crash that never should have happened, said CNN's aviation specialist Richard Quest. The industry will be studying the human factors of the crew on the plane for many years to come. The Bureau of Investigation and Analysis said its report does not examine the issue of responsibility for the crash, which is the subject of a separate judicial inquiry. History's deadliest plane crashes . The icing-up of the pitot tubes was ""a phenomenon that was known but misunderstood by the aviation community at the time of the accident,"" the report pointed out. Pilots should be trained on how to handle this event and a high-altitude stall with better technical instruction and flight simulator programs, the report said. Airplane ergonomics should also be improved, it said, ""to provide guidance to crews to help them recognize and manage unusual situations."" International communications systems should also be reviewed to ensure swifter response and recovery efforts after accidents at sea, the report said. It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of Flight 447's wreckage and the majority of the bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean. The aircraft's voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor in May 2011 after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles. The Bureau of Investigation and Analysis said the data indicated that Flight 447 crashed because the aircraft's speed sensors gave invalid readings. Who's really flying the plane? Last year's report from the bureau said the airplane climbed to 38,000 feet when ""the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled."" It then descended, crashing into the Atlantic. The descent lasted three minutes and 30 seconds, and the engines remained operational, the report said. Studies of the debris and bodies found soon after the crash led the French agency to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the bureau said in a 2009 report. Flight 447 was passing through an area prone to volatile and dangerous weather known as the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone when it went down. The zone is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world's hemispheres meet. Pilot: 'Damn it, we're going to crash' A previous report  from the French agency also raised questions about the training of the pilots on the flight. The recorders revealed the pilots had failed to discuss repeated stall warnings and ""had received no high altitude training"" to deal with the situation, the bureau said. They failed to regain control of the aircraft, and no announcement was made to the passengers, of 32 different nationalities, before it plummeted from the sky. How did you react to the report?

"White supremacist serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin was executed Wednesday morning after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his final requests for a stay, the Missouri Department of Public Safety said. The execution, which had been scheduled for shortly after midnight Wednesday, was delayed for hours because of court appeals. Franklin was administered a lethal injection at 6:07 a.m. CT (7:07 a.m. ET).  He died ten minutes later. Franklin refused his final meal and gave no final statement. He was on death row for the 1977 murder of Gerald Gordon outside a synagogue in St. Louis. He was blamed for 22 killings between 1977 and 1980 in a bid to start a race war. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon denied clemency for Franklin on Monday, saying he had committed ""merciless acts of violence, fueled by hate."" In addition to the killings, Franklin admitted to the attempted assassinations of Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt in 1978 and civil rights leader Vernon Jordan in 1980. Flynt, who was paralyzed by Franklin's bullet, has called for clemency for Franklin, saying ""the government has no business at all being in the business of killing people."" Battle over drugs used . One of Franklin's final legal maneuvers focused on the drug used for the lethal injection, pentobarbital.  His attorneys argued that the injection would violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey granted a stay of execution, finding Franklin's lawyers showed the use of pentobarbital carried ""a high risk of contamination and prolonged, unnecessary pain beyond that which is required to achieve death."" An intimate discussion with a serial killer . ""Given the irreversible nature of the death penalty and plaintiffs' medical evidence and allegations, a stay is necessary to ensure that the defendants' last act against Franklin is not permanent, irremediable cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment,"" Laughrey wrote. Another federal judge granted a second stay Tuesday, based on a separate defense petition contesting Franklin's competency. ""The Court concludes that a stay of execution is required to permit a meaningful review,"" U.S. District Judge Carol Jackson wrote. The state appealed both stays to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which decided early Wednesday that Franklin's lawyers had not provided enough evidence to warrant a stay. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Franklin's requests to step in and halt the execution. Missouri had planned to use propofol, the surgical anesthetic made infamous by the death of pop star Michael Jackson. But Nixon reversed that decision after being warned that the European Union -- whose members forbid capital punishment -- might halt shipments of the drug, leading to shortages for medical purposes. Missouri and other states that conduct executions have had to scramble for new drugs after European-based manufacturers banned American prisons from using their drugs in executions. In October, the state announced it would use pentobarbital, which would be provided by an unnamed compounding pharmacy. Franklin's lawyers argued that would raise the risk of contamination and a painful death.","Joseph Paul Franklin is executed after the Supreme Court declines to step in .

"(CNN) -- What is happening in Tunisia? Following a month of largely leaderless popular protests against the government, Tunisia's President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled the country on Friday. Fouad Mebazaa, the speaker of parliament, was sworn in the following day as interim president, and new elections are due within 60 days. . What were the protests about? They were sparked by the suicide of an unemployed college graduate in December. The man set himself on fire in front of a government building in the town of Sidi Bouzid after police confiscated his fruit cart, saying he was selling without a permit, according to Amnesty International. He died January 4 from his injuries. The event tore the lid off what appears to have been long-simmering fury at Ben Ali and his associates. Tunisians accuse the ruling circle of rampant corruption and nepotism. Recent diplomatic cables from the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia obtained by WikiLeaks revealed growing disquiet with the government -- especially over nepotism. Why does Tunisia matter? It could be the canary in a coal mine, since it's far from the only Arab nation with a long-time president and a young, underemployed population. Riots broke out in neighboring Algeria after weeks of demonstrations in Tunisia, and Egypt, Libya and Yemen will certainly be watching closely to see what happens in Tunis. Libya's Moammar Gadhafi said he was ""sad and hurt"" after Ben Ali fled Tunisia, warning that the country was heading for ""more unjustified chaos. ""It used to be a safe, secure and friendly nation. Development was going on, with job opportunities, work training, education. And suddenly, one day people destroy their own houses,"" Gadhafi said in a nationally televised speech. With a population of just over 10 million, Tunisia is not one of the major players in the region. It's not an oil exporter, does not have disputes with its neighbors, and is relatively prosperous and liberal for north Africa. So if popular protest can topple a president there, the region's autocrats must assume they need to be on their guard. How violent have the protests been? At least 21 people died in protests before Ben Ali fled, according to the government. Local unions put the figure at more than 50. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, citing reports, said the protests had been peaceful and that security forces used excessive force. Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi on Thursday declined to answer a CNN question about whether live ammunition or snipers were used against demonstrators, saying those matters will be part of an investigation into the conduct of the security forces. . Does this mean Tunisia is becoming a fully-fledged democracy? It's too soon to say. The protests have been dubbed the ""Jasmine Revolution,"" but CNN's Ben Wedeman in Tunis, the capital, says the military has moved quickly to fill the power void. Curfews are in place and tanks and armored personnel carriers were on the streets of the capital's main streets. . Are events like this unusual in Tunisia? They're very unusual, not only in Tunisia but across the Middle East. Ben Ali was only the second president of Tunisia since it gained independence from France in 1956. His predecessor, President Habib Bourguiba, ruled for more than 20 years until he was succeeded by Ben Ali -- then the prime minister -- in 1987. Ben Ali claimed victory in five successive presidential elections since then, most recently officially taking nearly 90% of the vote in November 2009. .","The country's longtime president fled on Friday .
Popular protests toppled him after a month .
He'd been in power since 1987 .

"Now-aged serial killer Juan Corona was denied parole for the sixth time on Monday, California authorities said. Corona, 77, is serving 25 concurrent terms of 25-years to life for 25 counts of first-degree murder in Corcoran State Prison in central California. A parole board decided that ""Corona's parole could reasonably pose a threat to public safety,"" said the statement from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. He will not be eligible for another parole hearing for five years. His crimes came to light in May 1971, when a farmer who had hired Corona as a labor contractor discovered a grave between two trees. Authorities went on to discover more graves in peach orchards along the Feather River near Marysville. All of Corona's victims were men who were last seen with him or who'd been hired through his contracting business, according to the corrections department.","Juan Corona is denied parole for the sixth time .

"(CNN)The former Navy SEAL who says he fired the shot that killed Osama bin Laden says he doesn't care if people believe him. ""The most important thing that I've learned in the last two years is to me it doesn't matter anymore if I am 'The Shooter.' The team got him,"" Robert O'Neill said in an audio interview with freelance journalist Alex Quade, a former CNN correspondent, that aired Friday on CNN's ""AC360."" ""Regardless of the negativity that comes with it, I don't give a f***. We got him."" ""AC360"" obtained the audio interview from Quade, who conducted a series of interviews with O'Neill over the past 18 months. The killing of bin Laden will go down in history, O'Neill said. ""But I don't care if I'm 'The Shooter,' and there are people who think I'm not. So whatever."" The audio interview follows an interview published this week in The Washington Post, in which O'Neill publicly identified himself as the SEAL who killed the leader of al Qaeda in 2011. The 38-year-old O'Neill had previously revealed details of the mission to Esquire magazine. But he was hesitant to attach his name to the account until his identity was linked to the story on a military blog earlier this week without his consent. O'Neill told the Post that other SEAL team members were involved in the raid, including Matt Bissonnette, who detailed the group's experiences in his memoir, ""No Easy Day,"" written under the pseudonym Mark Owen. O'Neill, who had been serving as a SEAL for 15 years at the time of the bin Laden raid, had participated in other missions, but he said he feared this mission would be his most difficult. In the audio interview with Quade, he said the members of SEAL Team Six talked about the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. He and other team members believed they would not return alive from the mission to get bin Laden. ""Well, you have to go pump yourself up to go die. So we would talk about this,"" O'Neill said. ""...(It was a) group of guys who knew time on Earth was up, so you could be honest with each other. And we all accepted and nobody was afraid. It was really cool."" He also said when he identified himself as the shooter to the families of 9/11 victims, they thanked him for closure. ""He died afraid, and he knew we were there to kill him. And that's closure,"" he said in the audio interview. Did Robert O'Neill really kill bin Laden? O'Neill's move to go public is a controversial one, as it violates an unspoken military rule: Don't seek attention for your service. ""We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety or financial gain,"" said an October 31 letter to the Naval Special Warfare ranks from commanding officer B.L. Losey and force Master Sgt. M.L. Margaraci. In the audio interview, O'Neill says he believes some details about the bin Laden mission, such as how he was killed, were no longer classified because they had been repeatedly leaked in the aftermath by high-level officials. ""Once anyone says anything at that level, it's not classified,"" he said. ""...I was told by people that I can't even say I'm a Navy SEAL, so I don't give a f*** what they think."" Twenty-three SEALs and their interpreter launched the assault on the bin Laden compound just after midnight on the morning of May 2, 2011. They shot and killed bin Laden's two bodyguards, one of bin Laden's sons and the wife of one of the bodyguards. They also wounded two other women. O'Neill has told his story before in a lengthy profile in Esquire in 2013, in which O'Neill was described not with his real name but only as ""The Shooter."" In the Esquire piece, O'Neill/The Shooter was said to have encountered al Qaeda's leader face-to-face in the top-floor bedroom of the compound in Abbottabad where he had been hiding for more than five years. The Shooter said the al Qaeda leader was standing up and had a gun ""within reach,"" and it was only then that the Shooter fired two shots into bin Laden's forehead, killing him. That account was in conflict with the narrative in ""No Easy Day."" Another member of the secretive SEAL Team 6, which executed the bin Laden raid, told CNN's Peter Bergen the story of The Shooter as presented in Esquire is false. According to this serving SEAL Team 6 operator, the story is ""complete BS."" But in the audio interview, O'Neill dismissed the criticism. ""Even now, I mean, there are guys now saying that I am full of s***,"" he said. ""...You only know what you were told unless you were in the room. And unfortunately for me, there was two people in the room, and one of us is dead and that's Osama bin Laden.""

"(CNN) -- On the sidelines of the massive People's Climate March last weekend in New York, I met an unassuming couple who were on vacation from Texas, the land of oil and gas. Hal and Helen Coon were sitting at a small cafe eating brunch, amused by the spectacle of hundreds of thousands of people parading down the streets of Manhattan in front of them. The crowd was chanting for world leaders to act on climate change, carrying signs that read ""No Planet B"" and ""To Change Everything, We Need Everyone,"" and generally causing a ruckus. The couple told me they had no idea the world's largest climate-change demonstration was about to invade their casual dining experience. They weren't so much annoyed by it as unmoved. Why is everything they have to say so negative? Hal asked. And how did they all get here? Did they walk to New York? I've been thinking about Hal and Helen as the world continues to debate the merits of acting urgently to curb greenhouse gas emissions. President Obama spoke passionately at the United Nations on Tuesday, saying, ""Our citizens keep marching; we cannot pretend we do not hear them."" The scary prospect is that the protests are being heard, but that they're not persuasive to people like Hal and Helen. I found the event moving -- and met many marchers who attended because they're already witnessing the repercussions of the changing climate. But, especially on Twitter, I've also met people who found any number of reasons to doubt the authenticity and urgent reasons behind the protest. We need a new way of talking about climate change -- one that includes all voices while acknowledging the fact that 97% of climate scientists say the climate is warming and it's because of us. It's tempting for those of us who want to see urgent action on climate change to write off everyone who doesn't see it that way. So here are six quick ideas on how to broaden the climate change conversation and make it more inclusive. This is coming from the perspective of someone who already cares about climate change, so, particularly if you're someone who doesn't, I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments or on Twitter. I'm @jdsutter. 1. Focus on community, not science . Lots of placards I saw in New York focused on the science of climate change -- how the nation should listen to its science teachers, etc. That argument already works on me. But research indicates skeptics want information about how fighting climate change could be good for communities and for social cohesion, not doom-and-gloom scenarios or scientific appeals. ""Climate change might eventually cause millions of deaths and all kinds of natural disasters. But don't tell that to a climate-change skeptic if you want them to do anything about it."" according to an article in NewScientist in 2012, summarizing research published in the journal Nature Climate Change. ""Instead, focus on how mitigation efforts can help people become more warm and caring towards others or how it can promote economic and technological development."" This is something environmentalists actually have been saying for decades, but the message has gotten lost. Bill McKibben, for example, who is a thought leader behind the People's Climate March, gave a speech in 2006 emphasizing that reducing dependency on fossil fuels and cars could bring people closer together, in proximity, and consequently strengthen community ties. ""The greatest problem of the fossil fuel era on this planet is not that it's destroying everything around us,"" he said, according to an online transcript. ""But the greatest problem is that that cheap coal and gas and oil has allowed us to live in such independence of each other that we've largely forgotten what community means, what neighbor means, we don't depend on each other for anything real anymore."" 2. Find common interests -- like the 'f**king fish' There's far too much stereotyping in the climate change debate. Those who care are labeled smelly hippies. Those who don't are anti-nature. In reality, there's nuance. Hal and Helen, my vacationing Texas couple, drive electric and hybrid cars, even though Hal works for an oil and gas company. As Meghan McCain, daughter of Republican Sen. John McCain, pointed out in a recent episode of TakePart Live, conservative interests are threatened by climate change. She suggested highlighting that more often. ""Republicans: You're not going to be able to hunt and fish as much, which I love doing, if there's no f**king fish anymore!"" she said on the show. Granted, fish are disappearing for a number of reasons, not least of which is overfishing. But oceans and forests are being affected by warming temperatures. And the underlying point -- that threats to hunting, not just to polar bears, are real, and should be considered and better understood -- is a solid one. 3. Cut the name-calling . The New Yorker's Andy Borowitz recently wrote a satirical piece called, ""Largest Climate-Change March in History Unlikely to Convince Idiots."" I'll admit I found it funny, but if we believe in this whole democracy thing, we shouldn't be content to preach to the choir, and we shouldn't resort to name-calling. Elected officials -- many of whom, in the United States, have balked at real climate-change action again and again -- represent people, and will listen to people who demand action. ""Calling each other idiots isn't productive,"" Meghan McCain said in that video. Her comments, by the way, led a writer for Breitbart News, the conservative site, to call her ""the Hanoi Jane of environmentalism."" Which, I would add, isn't especially productive, either. 4. Focus on money and innovation . Rockefeller. Google. These are names that matter in the business world, and to pro-business conservatives. So it's telling that both the heirs to the Rockefeller oil fortune and execs at Google have said recently that they will ditch their investments in the fossil fuels industry -- and/or groups that stunt for them. ""There is a moral imperative to preserve a healthy planet,"" Valerie Rockefeller Wayne told The Washington Post. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund will ""divest itself of investments in coal and tar sands, promising to reduce that exposure to less than 1% of the total portfolio by year's end,"" according to CNNMoney. Google, meanwhile, withdrew support for the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, with company chairman Eric Schmidt telling NPR ""they're just literally lying"" about climate science. Those moves matter. So does the fact that clean energy stands to make a lot of people a lot of money -- and could make the economy more sustainable. That's something Republicans should get behind, both logically and politically. ""As the impacts of climate change grow larger, the potential harm to economies will increase,"" according to ""The New Climate Economy,"" a recent report from the World Resources Institute and others. ""What this report shows, however, is that low-carbon policies can also generate strong growth in the medium term (5-15 years), provided that governments make the necessary policy and investment choices. ""Building more compact cities with good public transport, for example, not only reduces (greenhouse gases), but also allows people to move faster and more efficiently from home, to jobs, to shops and services; it reduces traffic congestion and air pollution, and it provides new business opportunities around transport hubs. Harnessing domestic renewable energy resources can boost energy security and reduce trade deficits. There is growing evidence that clean-tech (research and development) has particularly high spillover benefits, comparable to those from robotics, information technology and nanotechnologies."" So, boom. Dealing with climate change could be good for the economy. And could have benefits for health and technological advances as well. 5. Don't act like climate change is all that matters . Neil Cavuto, the Fox News host, has questioned whether climate change is the world's No. 1 issue when ISIS is ""chopping off people's heads."" It's not an either-or proposition. We can do something about climate and ISIS -- and homelessness, Ebola, etc. It would be a mistake, however, for climate evangelists to discount other issues in the face of this one. The world is full of problems. Climate change is one. 6. Note that some -- well, a few -- Republicans do care . I'm a little worried the premise of this list is flawed. While Republicans statistically care less about climate change than Democrats -- and are more likely to be skeptical of climate science -- some do advocate for climate action. About 60% of non-tea party Republicans told the Pew Research Center in a 2013 poll, for instance, that they believe there is ""strong evidence the Earth is warming."" A smaller batch -- 32% of non-tea party Republicans -- say it's mostly because of human activity. It's worse, however, if you look at Congress. Only 3% of Republicans there have said publicly that they believe that humans are causing climate change, according to an analysis by PolitiFact. THREE PERCENT! That's outrageous, but those who do support the science should be encouraged. And those who don't should be aware that the politics of climate change can and should shift. And they'll look very out of touch. The conversation needs to move from that toward what we can do about it -- together. This shouldn't be framed as an us-vs.-them issue. Climate change affects everyone, as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at a climate summit this week. And the protesters in New York were right to say we ""need everyone"" in order to fix this.","John Sutter: All of us need to start talking about climate change .

"(CNN) -- Meghan McCain, a contributor to TheDailyBeast.com, is the daughter of Sen. John McCain and Cindy McCain. But it's her recent verbal sparring with conservative Republicans that's put her in the spotlight. Meghan McCain tells Larry King on Monday night: ""I'm not going to be bullied around about my weight."" In a wide-ranging interview on Monday on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" McCain discussed her thoughts on President Obama, her recent heated exchange with radio host Laura Ingraham, her tattoos and more. The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: [President Obama] is taking some criticism for smiling and laughing [during his ""60 Minutes"" interview.] Are you one of those critics? Meghan McCain: You know, I actually am not. I think anyone that would possibly think that the president is not taking the economy seriously -- I just think it's ridiculous. ... King: [Is President Obama getting overexposed]? McCain: I think he is on the verge of it. I do think you have to be careful. But it is a different generation. [My] generation ...  we like our celebrities. And I think that he realizes that because he is very much a Generation Y president. However, he is on the risk of alienating his older followers. King: Does Obama seem like the same guy who ran against your dad? How do you view him? McCain: He's our president and when the election was over and when President Obama won, all negative feelings were gone. I support the president. King: How does your dad feel about that? McCain: I think the same way. You know, my family is really good at letting go of things and moving on. And he just holds no grudges. King: Do you think most of the people in your party agree with [Rush] Limbaugh? Do they want him to fail? McCain: I don't know, because there are many different personalities within the party. ... I would never want my president to fail, no matter which party is in power. King: You interviewed the [Louisiana] governor's wife? McCain: I interviewed [Supyira] Jindal, the first lady of Louisiana. And she's a fascinating woman. She totally impressed me because she was very warm and friendly. I went down and interviewed her and the piece came out today on TheDailyBeast.com. King: Do you like him [Gov. Bobby Jindal]? McCain: I do. You know, we do veer off on some things politically, but any leader that I'm going to have I'm going to veer off politically. King: Do you consider yourself a moderate? Are you moderate liberal? McCain: I consider myself a progressive Republican. I am liberal on social issues. And I think that the party is at a place where social issues shouldn't be the issues that define the party. And I have taken heat, but in fairness to me, I am a different generation than the people that are giving me heat. I'm 24 years old. I'm not in my 40s, I'm not in my 50s and older. King: Therefore, you must, based on what you said, disagree with your father? ... Do you discuss it? McCain: We have a very big generation gap between me and my father. Yes, we discuss them. He's very open-minded. I was raised in an open-minded home. I was raised a Christian, but I was raised open-minded Christian -- one to accept people, love people, not pass judgment. ... I believe in gay marriage. ...  I personally am pro-life, but I'm not going to judge someone that's pro-choice. It is not my place to judge other people and what they do with their body. King: We have an e-mail question from Veronica, Huntington Park, California: ""Do you share most of your father's political views?"" McCain: When it comes to war and the economy, and many fiscal conservative values, I agree with him. I mean I fell in love with the Republican Party because of my father. King: Earlier this month, [you] wrote a DailyBeast column criticizing right-wing pundit Ann Coulter. Conservative radio host Laura Ingraham fired back at you, including making a comment about your weight. You then gave a straight talk response in an appearance on ""The View."" What led to that? McCain: You know, it's so funny. I was in the airport today and this guy goes, ""Hey, Meghan, kiss my fat ass."" And I was like oh my gosh. That's where this has gone to. As far as I'm concerned with what's going on with Laura Ingraham, on my end, it's over. There are nine million women in this country suffering from eating disorders. And I'm not going to be bullied around about my weight and what kind of standards I'm not fitting. ... King: Were you surprised that Laura, who's had breast cancer, got into something that personal? McCain: I had never heard of her before until this happened. King: You didn't know her? McCain: No. I'm not familiar with her work. But I hope she doesn't do it again. King: What about Ann Coulter? McCain: She didn't respond, which is fine with me. ... All I wanted to do is show women that you don't have to be Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham to have a place in the Republican Party. ... Supriya Jindal is a good role model, but a lot of people hadn't heard of her. And I just want to show that you don't have to think one way and fit into this one box in order to be a member of the Republican Party. King: Were [your parents] angry at Laura Ingraham? McCain: My mother was. She's a very protective mama bear. King: Are you a tattooer? McCain: I have one. My brothers have a lot of tattoos. I love tattoos. I do. I know, you never would have thought me, right? But I do. King: No. You don't look like a tattooer.  What do your folks think of that? McCain: I've got supportive parents, you know. My mom thinks it's cute. ... I have a little star on my foot. King: What kind of dad is your father? McCain: He's great. I love my dad so much. He's the best father to me. And like I said, he's so supportive of me and my career and what I do and speaking my mind. When you grow up having a maverick as a father and an example, you can understand how I turned out like this.","Meghan McCain tells Larry King she's over recent dust-up with Laura Ingraham .

"West Point, New York (CNN) -- President Obama said Tuesday that the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan is part of a strategy to reverse the Taliban's momentum and stabilize the country's government. ""There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum,"" Obama said at the U.S. Military Academy. ""Al Qaeda has not re-emerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe-havens along the border. ""And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population. ... In short, the status quo is not sustainable."" Obama said he'd begin sending the additional troops ""at the fastest pace possible"" starting in early 2010 ""with a goal of starting to withdraw forces from the country in July 2011."" The president said additional U.S. forces bolstered by NATO troops ""will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces."" Senior administration officials said Tuesday that Obama has a goal of withdrawing most U.S. forces by the end of his current term, which ends in January 2013. Watch what the new troops will do in Afghanistan . It will be the second increase of U.S. forces in the war-torn Islamic country ordered by Obama since he took office in January. In his speech Tuesday, Obama said his strategy had three objectives: . • Deny al Qaeda a safe haven . • Reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow Afghanistan's government . • Strengthen Afghanistan's security forces and government . The additional troops was one way to achieve these, he said. Other strategies will include holding Afghan government leaders accountable for corruption, focus assistance on areas that could help the lives of Afghans, and securing the country's border with Pakistan. ""We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border,"" Obama said. The president said he rejected the option of committing more forces for an undefined mission of nation-building without any deadlines. ""I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests,"" Obama said. ""Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan."" Obama rejected analogies with the war in Vietnam that divided America in the 1960s and 1970s. ""Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action,"" Obama said. ""Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border."" Obama said the U.S. has no interest in occupying Afghanistan. ""We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens,"" Obama said. ""And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron."" Obama spoke to an audience of West Point cadets, staff and guests in outlining his strategy that he has deliberated for months, meeting several times with his national security team. He recognized that some in the audience had fought in Afghanistan, and some would be deployed in the future. ""As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service,"" he said. The additional U.S. forces ""will increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces, and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight,"" Obama said. ""And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans."" Obama also said he is asking NATO allies to provide more troops, and that he is ""confident that there will be further contributions in the days ahead."" ""Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""Now, we must come together to end this war successfully. For what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility -- what's at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world."" The new troop deployment would increase the total U.S. commitment to roughly 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, bolstered by more than 40,000 NATO forces. Obama, whom Republicans had accused of ""dithering"" over the decision, concluded the deployment needs to be accelerated to knock back the Taliban, the senior officials said. The push for a speedy deployment is surprising because White House officials who defended Obama's slow pace of coming to a decision had said the Pentagon wouldn't be able to get new troops to Afghanistan that quickly. A Pentagon official noted that, under the new strategy, Obama is ""trying to do it faster"" than the 12-month timeline initially requested by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. McChrystal wrote in a report in August that a ""failure to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the near-term (next 12 months) -- while Afghan security capacity matures -- risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible."" The Pentagon official said Obama's six-month timeline for sending the new troops is ""very aggressive"" and will be challenging for the military to fulfill. The official expressed confidence, however, that the military would successfully carry out the order. Opponents of an increased U.S. troop deployment complain that the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai is corrupt and an unreliable partner. Obama spoke to Karzai for an hour by videoconference Tuesday to discuss the deployment decision, according to a White House statement. ""The president also emphasized that U.S. and international efforts in Afghanistan are not open-ended and must be evaluated toward measurable and achievable goals within the next 18 to 24 months,"" the statement said. Share your views on Obama's Afghanistan decision . The decision to send the troops carries significant political risk for Obama, who will announce it nine days before he travels to Oslo, Norway, to accept the Nobel Peace Prize. His liberal base, which helped him win last year's presidential election, opposes another troop deployment to Afghanistan. In addition, the deployment, expected to cost an extra $30 billion a year, comes amid high unemployment as the economy emerges from a recession. That concerns Democrats and Republicans faced with competing domestic priorities such as health care reform and job creation. U.S.-led troops first invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the ruling Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught. Taliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region. The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops.","30,000 troops to be deployed within six months, President Obama says .

"Archaeologists say they unearthed a rare find during a dig in Egypt: a sarcophagus that's 3,600 years old -- with a mummy still inside. Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported Thursday that a team working on a routine excavation at a tomb in Luxor uncovered the painted, human-shaped sarcophagus. It dates back to 1600 B.C., when the Pharaonic 17th Dynasty reigned in Egypt, the country's Supreme Council of Antiquities said. The sarcophagus belonged to a top government official, whose mummy was enclosed inside, Al-Ahram said, citing Egypt's antiquities minister, Mohamed Ibrahim. The sarcophagus is engraved with titles of the official, but archaeologists haven't yet been able to identify him, Ibrahim said. The Spanish-Egyptian team also found two other burials while digging at the Draa Abul-Naga necropolis on Luxor's west bank, Al-Ahram reported, but both were empty.

"Norwegian interior designer Marte Deborah Dalelv has spoken out after being handed a 16-month prison sentence in Dubai -- after she went to police to report she had been raped by a colleague. The 24-year-old was convicted and sentenced on charges of having unlawful sex, making a false statement and illegal consumption of alcohol. Her story is dominating the headlines in Norway, and has raised serious questions over the way women who allege sexual assault are treated in the United Arab Emirates. Dalelv, who had been working at an interior design firm in Qatar since September 2011, told CNN on Saturday how a work trip to Dubai in March with three colleagues turned into a nightmare. She said she had been out at a bar with her colleagues and friends, and asked a male colleague to walk her to her room when they returned at 3 a.m. to the hotel. She'd asked him to escort her because the hotel was large and confusing, and she didn't want to be wandering on her own, knowing she'd been drinking, she said. When they reached a room, she realized it wasn't hers -- but the man then pulled her inside despite her vocal objections, according to Dalelv. ""He dragged me by my purse in, so I thought, 'OK, I just need to calm the situation down. I will finish my bottle of water, I will sit here and then I will excuse myself and say I feel fine,'"" she said. That was pretty much the last thing she said she remembers before the alleged sexual assault. ""I woke up with my clothes off, sleeping on my belly, and he was raping me. I tried to get off, I tried to get him off, but he pushed me back down."" After someone knocked -- the hotel wake-up call -- she managed to get dressed and make it downstairs to the hotel reception, Dalelv said. ""I called the police. That is what you do. We are trained on that from when we are very young,"" she said. Some 10 or 12 male police officers arrived, but no female police officers were present, she said. Statements were taken from both Dalelv and the alleged rapist. She was then taken to Bur Dubai police station, she said. 6 men convicted of raping Swiss tourist in India . After again giving her version of events to officers, Dalelv said, ""They asked me, 'Are you sure you called the police because you just didn't like it?' I said, 'Well of course I didn't like it.' That is when I knew, I don't think they are going to believe me at all."" Dalelv says she was taken for an intimate medical exam and tested for alcohol consumption. Her belongings were taken and she was kept in jail for four days, she said, with no explanation as to why. Dubai police and UAE government officials have not responded to repeated CNN requests for comment. Dalelv said she managed to call her parents on the third day to tell them she had been raped and ask them to contact the Norwegian Embassy. A day later, a representative from the Norwegian consulate came to the police station and she was released -- but her passport was not returned. A piece of paper with Arabic text was handed to her, she said. An Arabic speaker told her it listed two charges against her: one for sex outside of marriage and the other for public consumption of alcohol. Both are violations of the law in the United Arab Emirates. It was the first time she was made aware that she faced charges, Dalelv said. She was allowed out on bail and has been staying since at the Norwegian Seaman's Center in Dubai. Subsequently, she said her manager advised her to tell the police it was voluntary sexual intercourse and likely the whole issue would just go away. She followed the advice and in one of the many hearings at the public prosecutor's office, she made a statement saying it was voluntary. Dalelv was then charged with making a false statement. ""That was my biggest regret because it wasn't voluntary. I just thought it would all go away,"" she told CNN. But a representative of Al Mana Interiors, who Dalelv worked for, told CNN that she was not advised by her manager to say the sex was consensual but rather by a police officer, who told her that in Arabic and it was translated into English by her manager. Dalelv said a month after the rape, while forced to stay in Dubai as the case wound through the legal system, she was fired. The representative, who declined to be publicly identified, said Dalelv and the Sudanese man she accused -- who is married with three children -- have both been terminated by Al Mana Interiors for ""drinking alcohol at a staff conference that resulted in trouble with the police."" A statement released late Saturday by Al Mana Interiors spokesman Hani El Korek said the company was sympathetic to Dalelv ""during this very difficult situation."" It also said that company representatives were by her side through the initial investigation, spending ""days at both the police station and the prosecutor's office to help win her release."" ""Only when Ms. Dalelv declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status, and ceased communication with her employer, was the company forced to end our relationship with her,"" the statement said. ""The decision had nothing to do with the rape allegation, and unfortunately neither Ms. Dalelv nor her attorneys have chosen to contact the company to discuss her employment status."" Opinion: Gang rapes, the dark side of Egypt's protests . The company is owned by Qatari billionaire Wissam Al Mana, who made headlines earlier this year after it was revealed that he has secretly married singer Janet Jackson in 2012. Dalelv was convicted Tuesday on all three charges and was sentenced to one year in jail for having unlawful sex, three months in jail for making a false statement and one month for illegal consumption of alcohol. CNN could not immediately confirm what happened to the alleged perpetrator, who was charged with public intoxication and having sex outside of marriage. Dalelv is scheduled to appear at the court on September 5 to begin the appeal proceedings. Dalelv, who is not allowed to leave the UAE pending the appeal, said her lawyers have instructed her to be prepared to go back into jail while they submit a request for bail while the appeal is ongoing. As a rule, CNN does not identify victims of sexual assault, but Dalelv went public with her story. A Facebook page has been set up calling for Dalelv's release, as well as a petition urging the Norwegian government to take action on her behalf. Her conviction may risk wider diplomatic repercussions. Norwegian Foreign Affairs Minister Espen Barth Eide called his UAE counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed al-Nahyan, on Friday night to protest Dalelv's sentencing, a statement from the Norwegian ministry said. ""I emphasized that we believe that the conviction is contrary to fundamental human rights, including conventions that the UAE have officially ratified,"" Eide is quoted as saying. ""Norway will continue to do what we can to support her in what is a very difficult situation. Our cooperation with the UAE is strong and good, but I conveyed to my colleague that we are worried that this difficult case may disturb our good relations if we do not reach a good solution in the near future."" Dalelv told CNN she received a call from Eide on Friday reiterating Norway's support. While Dubai has a reputation as a cosmopolitan city that boasts Western influences, where visitors can drink at bars and restaurants and unmarried couples can share hotel rooms, the country adheres to Islamic laws and traditions. The United Arab Emirates has been heavily criticized by rights groups, which say it condones sexual violence against women. Human Rights Watch has called its record ""shameful,"" saying it must change the way it handles such cases. In December 2012, a British woman reported being raped by three men in Dubai. She was found guilty of drinking alcohol without a license and fined. In January 2010, a British woman told authorities she was raped by an employee at a Dubai hotel. She was charged with public intoxication and having sex outside of marriage. An Australian woman reported in 2008 that she was drugged and gang-raped. She was convicted of having sex outside marriage and drinking alcohol, and she was sentenced to 11 months in prison.

"Mission accomplished -- Team USA booked its place in the last-16 of the World Cup after escaping from one of the tournament's toughest groups. Jurgen Klinsmann's men slumped to a 1-0 defeat by Germany in Thursday's final Group G game but still qualified despite Portugal defeating Ghana 2-1. Thomas Muller's second-half strike condemned the U.S. to defeat following a rain-soaked contest in Recife. But Cristiano Ronaldo's late strike for Portugal inflicted defeat on Ghana and ensured the Americans qualified in second place on goal difference. The U.S. will now travel to Salvador where its opponent will be Belgium on Tuesday, while Germany will face Algeria on Monday. For Klinsmann, a man who won the 1990 World Cup as a player with West Germany and coached the national side to the semifinals in 2006, this was always going to be an emotional occasion. Sitting on the U.S. bench just meters away from his old friend Joachim Low, the man who worked as his assistant eight years ago, the game had plots and sub-plots galore. ""We created too few chances, but it's still fantastic to go through,"" Klinsmann said. ""Everybody said we had no chance, but we've taken it and we're now in the last 16."" Any friendship or sentimentality was soon forgotten as the two teams went toe-to-toe in a heavyweight battle. Played in monsoon-like conditions, both sets of players struggled to find any rhythm in the first half. The buildup to the game was disrupted by heavy rain in Recife which left fans wading through flooded roads on the way to the stadium. Traffic was brought to a standstill by floodwaters while family members of the U.S. team were unable to attend because of the adverse weather conditions. Germany, which thrashed Portugal 4-0 in its opening game before being held 2-2 by Ghana, began in confident fashion and dominated possession. But Team USA, marshaled by the impressive Omar Gonzalez, looked more than comfortable as the rain continued to lash down. Despite being forced to sit back and soak up pressure early on, it was the U.S. which created the opening chance of the first half when Graham Zusi sent a curling effort just over the crossbar. Germany, playing without a recognized striker, enjoyed plenty of possession in front of the U.S. defense but rarely managed to find a way through. And when it did, goalkeeper Tim Howard was on hand to ensure Mesut Ozil's effort was blocked, after the Arsenal player momentarily eluded his marker. Germany changed tactics after the interval with the introduction of veteran striker Miroslav Klose -- the man who stands joint-top in the World Cup goalscorers' chart with 15 to his name. And it was the 36-year-old who almost made the breakthrough just minutes after interval but could only plant his header wide after meeting Muller's cross. As Germany continued to push forward, the U.S defense began to drop deeper and deeper. And with 10 minutes of the second half played, Germany finally got the breakthrough it had threatened. Defender Per Mertesacker sent a thumping header towards goal and while Howard managed to beat the ball away, Muller fired home the rebound from the edge of the penalty area. It was a magnificent strike from Muller, an effort which left Howard with absolutely no chance as it flew through a clutch of players and into the corner of the net. It put the German joint top scorer at Brazil 2014 alongside home hero Neymar and Argentina's Lionel Messi. Trailing by a single goal, news began to filter through that Ghana had moved level against Portugal, with Asamoah Gyan canceling out John Boye's first-half own-goal. Gyan is now Africa's all-time leading scorer at the World Cup with six, having passed Cameroon's Roger Milla. With its future in the tournament hanging by a thread, the U.S. produced a battling performance with former Germany international Jermaine Jones and Kyle Beckerman snarling at the heart of the midfield. But with 10 minutes remaining, Ronaldo's strike in Brasilia left Ghana with a mountain to climb -- though it wasn't enough to prevent an early trip home for Real Madrid's world player of the year. That didn't prevent the U.S. piling forward in search of an equalizer though and both Alejandro Bedoya and captain Clint Dempsey came close to scoring at the death. ""We were dominant,"" said Muller, who scored five goals at the 2010 World Cup, where Germany lost in the semifinals. ""All the Americans did was sit back deep in their own half, and when that happens, it just becomes a patience game. ""But sometimes even I manage to have a bright idea -- I spend the whole day training like I'm obsessed anyway.""","Team USA qualify for last 16 despite 1-0 defeat by Germany .

"(CNN) -- The weekend massacre at an upscale shopping center in Kenya is shining a new light on an old concern for Western counterterrorism officials: the recruitment of jihadist fighters from Somali communities in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It's a concern all too familiar for many Somali-American families in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where young men have been slipping away to join the al Qaeda-affiliated guerrilla group Al-Shabaab for the past few years, sometimes in groups. Several have died, their relatives learning of their deaths in cryptic phone calls or in messages posted online. One of those killed was Burhan Hassan, who was killed fighting in Somalia. His uncle, Abdirizak Bihi, told CNN that members of the city's Somali community have been trying to counteract the recruitment efforts. ""What we have learned for the last five years is we have to speak out against this,"" Bihi said. Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Nairobi attack . In a message on its now-suspended Twitter page, Al-Shabaab named nine people it said were among the gunmen who stormed Nairobi's Westgate Mall on Saturday. Three of them were from the United States and one each was from Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom, it said. ""It isn't totally surprising, given the fact that we know Shabaab has recruited in the United States,"" CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen said Sunday. ""We also know they have recruited in a number of European countries."" Bergen noted that the group's Twitter page includes tweets in colloquial English, ""the kind of English that an American, or perhaps somebody who grew up in the UK, would be using."" Al-Shabaab is fighting to implement a stricter form of Islamic law in Somalia, a struggle in which Kenyan troops have been directly involved since 2011. Kenyan troops wrested control of the key Somali port of Kismayo from the jihadists in 2012, and Somali government and African Union troops drove the group out of its strongholds in the capital Mogadishu in 2011. As early as 2008, the FBI warned that more than a dozen youths, some of them American citizens, had left Minneapolis, home to the largest Somali population in the United States. At least three are believed to have carried out suicide bombings in Somalia, where an internationally backed interim government has taken tenuous root after two decades of civil war and near-anarchy. Minneapolis' Somali community ""is 100% against terror,"" said Bihi. But he said a lot of families arrive owing ""a lot of debt,"" and community youth programs were ""almost nil."" Al-Shabaab recruiters engaged teens by providing them entertainment and role models, then ""brainwashed"" them, he said. A senior State Department official told CNN that U.S. officials are trying to confirm whether the names released by Al-Shabaab are Americans, but said they are becoming more confident American citizens were involved in the Kenyan attack. The official said the administration has been concerned and raising alarm bells about Al-Shabaab recruitment in the Somali-American community for years and would be making decisions in coming days about additional efforts to stem the flow of recruits. How Al-Shabaab picks its targets . In 2010, a federal grand jury charged 14 people in the United States with aiding Al-Shabaab. Two women in Rochester, Minnesota, were convicted of soliciting more than $8,000 for the group under false pretenses, telling contributors the money was for the poor, and received 10- and 20-year prison terms. The rest of those named in the indictment had already gone overseas, including Omar Al-Hammami, who became something of a jihadist rock star before falling out with the group and dying in a fratricidal ambush in 2012. Hammami differed from many of the other recruits. He was raised a Baptist in Alabama, but converted to Islam as a young man and created rap-style recruiting videos that bridged American and Somali culture. Another man, Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed, was sentenced to more than nine years in March after pleading guilty to aiding Al-Shabaab. Ahmed was a native of Eritrea who had been living in Sweden before joining Al-Shabaab, prosecutors said. He was arrested in Nigeria and transferred to New York for prosecution. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Several young Somalis from Minneapolis have died fighting for Al-Shabaab .

"(CNN) -- Kia Scherr couldn't reach her husband and daughter after the terror attacks in Mumbai, India, and didn't know if they were alive. Alan Scherr, 58, died in the attack on the Oberoi hotel in Mumbai, his wife, Kia, confirms. She learned on Friday that her husband, Alan Scherr, 58, and 13-year-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in the assault on the Oberoi hotel. Scherr told CNN that a U.S. consular official confirmed the deaths after members of the group they were traveling with identified the bodies. Naomi and Alan Scherr had come to Mumbai with a travel group for a high-tech meditation retreat with the Synchronicity Foundation, she said.

"The government shutdown is ""extremely damaging"" to U.S. intelligence operations, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday. Clapper noted that he has worked in the intelligence field for 50 years, and ""never seen anything like this."" The shutdown ""seriously damages our ability to protect the safety and security of this nation,"" he told a Senate panel. The law allows intelligence agencies to hold on to the employees needed to protect against ""imminent threat to life or property,"" he noted.  Following that guide, approximately 70% of employees were furloughed, he said. ""We do not consider any of our employees 'non-essential,'"" and officials had to make ""very painful choices"" about who would be furloughed, he added. The shutdown affects the ability of the intelligence community to support the military, diplomats, and policy makers, Clapper explained. ""Damage will accumulate over time,"" and the danger ""will be insidious,"" he warned. And with intelligence workers facing financial struggles, particularly after already suffering through furloughs due to sequestration, ""This is a dreamland for foreign intelligence services to recruit,"" Clapper said. Intelligence services are setting up counseling to help employees handle financial issues, he said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, took the opportunity to assail both Republicans and Democrats, including the president, over the situation. ""I think it's irresponsible for all of us to let it continue, but where the hell is the commander-in-chief?"" he said.  ""If you really told him that, that our nation is less safe and every day that goes by we're being less capable of detecting potential terror attacks against the homeland, ... why aren't the members of the House and the Senate in the White House right now to try to solve this problem?"" ""For the president of the United States, for our House Democrats to not negotiate is not responsible. For our Republican Party not to try to find a way to end this mess is irresponsible,"" he added. At around the same time,  President Barack Obama invited congressional leaders to the White House later Wednesday  to discuss reopening the government and raising the debt ceiling.

"(CNN) -- The urge to undress a mummy can be strong. In the 19th century, Egyptologists didn't think twice about tearing off a mummy's wrappings. Even Ramses the Great couldn't avoid the indignity of being stripped bare in front of an audience of curious onlookers. Today's experts in the field know better. ""Certainly, it's a damaging process, and you lose a lot of information and disturb the mummy itself. It's also something that is no longer necessary with advancements in technology,"" says Dr. Daniel Antoine, the curator of physical anthropology at the British Museum in London. The institute's vast collection of sarcophagi has remained largely undisturbed for over 200 years. This year, however, researchers have again decided to peek underneath the linens (and skin and muscle), though this time using the Royal Brompton Hospital's dual-energy CT scanner -- one of the most advanced in London. The data they gather from the scans is then plugged into the same 3D-modeling software used by car companies to analyze engines. The technology has given them the clearest picture to date of what life was like along the Nile 2,500 years ago. ""You can tell the software what part are bandages and bone and skin, and you can peel away those layers. You can virtually remove the bandages to look at the body and any amulets covering the body, then remove the skin to look at the bones and any preserved organs,"" says Antoine. ""What that means in normal language is we're able to see a lot more, a lot more clearly."" Tamut, the temple singer . Of the corpses they've scanned, eight will be on exhibit at the British Museum from May 22. The star of the show is undoubtedly Tamut, a priestess and temple singer who died in Luxor, Egypt around 900 BC. The CT scans have allowed researchers to make a lot of new discoveries about Tamut. By analyzing her pelvic bone, they were able to find her approximate age (between 30 and 50). Gazing into her arteries, they found a possible cause of death -- plaque build-up that could have resulted in a heart attack or stroke. Antoine's team could also see the amulets placed around her body in vivid detail (several of which have been 3-D printed using the CT scan data). ""We're even able to discern the inscriptions on some of the amulets,"" notes Antoine, including one of the Eye of Horus on a plate covering the incision used to remove her internal organs. ""The Eye of Horus was believed to have healing properties, so it could have been used to heal her wounds in the afterlife,"" explains Antoine. The man with bad teeth . The scans also revealed surprises about another of the of the British Museum's mummies. Despite being in a woman's sarcophagus, CT scans told researchers the body was male, that he died around 600 BC, and that he probably lived in terrible pain because of a plethora of dental abscesses. ""We've found that a lot of the mummies had terrible dental health issues, specifically tooth decay and numerous abscesses caused by infections that spread to the blood stream,"" says Antoine. The unknown man is a particularly unique specimen, in that he is also evidence of a botched embalming job. Scans show both chunks of brain still present inside his skull, as well as part of the spatula used to remove it. ""There are few examples of such probes, and it's great to see the shape of the one they would have used,"" says Antoine. ""It highlights some of the issues embalmers were confronted with. The hole on the inside of the skull through which the brain is extracted is rarely bigger than 2.5 centimeters, demonstrating a strong knowledge of human anatomy.""","New CT scans help researchers ""undress"" a mummy virtually .

"Pilot reliance on automated systems to fly big jets and related errors have become a key focus of investigators digging into last summer's Asiana Airlines crash in San Francisco that killed three people and injured more than 180 others. Details were to be released at a National Transportation Safety Board hearing starting Tuesday. But the hearing has been postponed because of the federal government's weather-related closing, the NTSB tweeted. The hearing pulls together the strands of the probe so far into the crash of Flight 214, but the board's conclusions and a final report are still months away. NTSB: No distress call prior to UPS cargo plane crash in Alabama . The hearing is also expected to examine how automated cockpit systems impact pilot workload, the meeting agenda showed. Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that  investigators will release new information highlighting how an over-reliance on cockpit computers and pilot confusion about automated engine thrust settings led to the crash in July as Boeing 777 sought to land at San Francisco airport. The report cited people familiar with the matter. Originating in Seoul, Flight 214 struck a sea wall and skidded along the runway, breaking into pieces and catching fire. Investigators have not yet said if the crew failed to activate auto-throttles, which aim to maintain a certain airspeed, or somehow disconnected them during the approach, the Journal reported. The safety board would not confirm nor deny the Journal report.

"It was a desperate plea from a tearful dad, tossed like a message in a bottle into the vast sea of the Internet. ""You ever do something crazy because you just don't know what to do anymore? Well, that's what I'm doing right now,"" said John Berlin, staring into the camera with moist, red-rimmed eyes. ""I'm calling out to Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook,"" he continued. ""You've been putting out these new movies, these one-minute movies that everyone's been sharing. Well, my son passed away ... and we can't access his Facebook account. I've tried e-mailing, and different things, but it ain't working. All we want to do is see his movie. ""I know it's a shot in the dark, but I don't care,"" he said, his voice breaking. ""I want to see my son's video. His name's Jesse Berlin. So please help me."" The Arnold, Missouri, man shot the emotionally raw, 84-second clip on his phone and posted it Wednesday morning to YouTube and Facebook. By late afternoon it had hundreds of thousands of views and he was deluged with Facebook messages. Then, that night, Facebook called. As Berlin listened, stunned, they told him would indeed make a personalized ""A Look Back"" video for Jesse, using posts he had made public on Facebook before his death in 2012 at age 21. Now Berlin is planning to share it online as a tribute to his late son. ""I just wanted a piece of him,"" he told CNN in a phone interview. ""These (Facebook) videos really touched me. And every time Jesse would pop up (in one of them), I was choking back tears. I just wanted so desperately to see how his video would turn out."" Facebook created the customized videos for most of its active users Tuesday to celebrate its 10th anniversary. The 62-second clips note the year the user joined Facebook, then show a handful of their most-liked posts and a seemingly random selection of their photos -- all set to instrumental music. A Facebook spokesperson said Berlin's video came to the attention of a staffer Wednesday, who shared it on an internal network. ""With the number of people using our service, it's often very difficult to act on behalf of one. But John's story and emotion moved us to take action -- so we did,"" the spokesperson said. Facebook realizes that by granting Berlin's wish, they risk being deluged with similar requests from other users wanting to see video highlights of their deceased loved ones. Honoring all the requests would be difficult, but where do you draw the line? It's a thorny question. The Facebook spokesperson would not address this issue directly. But he said Facebook, which introduced ""memorial"" pages for deceased users in 2009, wants to give users better ways to honor their loved ones on the site. ""This experience reinforced to us that there's more Facebook can do to help people celebrate and commemorate the lives of people they have lost,"" he said. ""We'll have more to share in the coming weeks and months."" John Berlin said his son Jesse died of natural causes in his sleep on the morning of January 28, 2012. Doctors could not pinpoint the cause of death, although he was told a viral infection may have impacted Jesse's heart, he said. Jesse Berlin was a musician and played rhythm guitar in Fivefold, a popular Missouri rock band. ""Jesse was all about having fun,"" his father said. ""We'd always say our hobby was laughing. We would just cut up about everything."" He is also survived by his mother, Lisa, sister Nicole, 26, and brother Jared, 21. John Berlin posted Jesse's ""A Look Back"" video on Friday to YouTube and his Facebook page, where it's been liked and shared thousands of times. Berlin still can't believe his unassuming video appeal, which now has more than 2.7 million views and 7,500 comments, got Facebook's attention from a small town in the Midwest. But he hopes that his story will inspire Facebook to help others like him and ease their access to the accounts of late loved ones. ""I'm glad that we're finding purpose in Jesse's death,"" he said. ""I can't express how much this means to me.""","Missouri dad posts emotional video asking Facebook to share video of his late son .

"Curtis Reeves and the widow of the man he killed inside a movie theater both shed tears Wednesday inside a Florida courtroom, as lawyers for both sides called witnesses to support their arguments on whether the 71-year-old gunman should get bail. Along with such raw emotion, the Dade City hearing was flush with vivid details from witnesses about what happened early in the afternoon of January 13 inside a theater in the Tampa suburb of Wesley Chapel. They recounted how, after Reeves told management about Chad Oulson texting during previews, the men exchanged words. Oulson then allegedly tossed his bag of popcorn at Reeves, who fired a single, fatal gunshot moments later. He's been jailed ever since, without bail, on a second-degree murder charge. Wednesday's testimony and the cross-examinations were so extensive that the day ended without a decision from Judge Pat Siracusa. Instead, the hearing will resume at 10 a.m. Friday with testimony from more prosecution witnesses and the playing of surveillance video and audio. Several people testified Wednesday as character witnesses for Reeves. The most powerful of them was his daughter, Jennifer Shaw. No threats before shooting, widow says . In addition to discussing her father's financial holdings -- including a house valued at $186,000 as well as $22,000 in bank accounts -- Shaw spoke of how her father had always been involved and supportive. That includes helping with her 2-year-old daughter and after she moved in with her parents after splitting from her husband. Shaw said she didn't recall her father -- who became visibly emotional with his daughter on the stand -- getting angry with strangers, said his temperament hasn't changed in recent years and insisted that he doesn't pose a danger to the community. And after being asked whether she had any doubt her father would show up for court if he received bail, Shaw answered unequivocally: ""No doubt at all."" Shaw said she'd long ""assumed"" that her father, a Navy veteran and retired police officer with a concealed weapons permit, carried a gun with him at all times. But should he come to the family's Brooksville home, there would be no guns around: Shaw testified that all firearms and ammunition in that house were removed the day after the theater shooting. The prosecution then began presenting its own slate of witnesses, starting with 68-year-old Charles Cummings. He sat a few seats down from Oulson that January day in the row in front of Reeves. During the previews, Cummings said he heard Reeves and Oulson talking, and at one point, the latter said, ""I'm just texting my 2-year-old daughter."" Soon after that, a ""very agitated"" Reeves left the theater then returned a few minutes later and again addressed Oulson. Moviegoers recounted what happened next. Widow: 'My whole world just got shattered' Mark Douglas Turner -- who spent 27 years in the Air Force, including time as a clandestine officer who worked in China -- recalled a relatively calm Oulson saying, ""Do you mind, I've got a voice mail from my daughter's babysitter? Do you mind I check to see if my daughter's alright?"" The atmosphere changed considerably soon after that. While witnesses did not recount what Reeves said, Cummings said that, whatever it was, ""I felt Oulson had enough."" Alan Hamilton, a corporal with the Sumter County sheriff's office who was taking in a movie with his wife, said he heard Oulson saying, at one point, ""I am trying to text my f**king daughter, if you don't mind"" -- using graphic language that Reeves' lawyer said suggested Oulson was angry and threatening. The popcorn flew in Reeves' direction soon thereafter. ""And almost immediately,"" recalled Turner, who said Oulson threw the bag, ""the gun comes out and there are shots fired."" Oulson then stumbled and said, ""I can't believe he shot me,"" before falling on Cummings' son, the witness recalled. A nurse who also happened to be in theater then testified -- as Oulson's widow, Nicole, wiped away tears -- about unsuccessful efforts to save his life. According to Turner, Reeves said, ""Throw popcorn in my face."" Couple describes encounter with Reeves . Hamilton said that right after the shooting, he acted quickly to take the gun from Reeves -- who was sitting, as he'd been during the shooting -- and subdue him. Before more authorities arrived, Reeves' wife told her husband ""that was no cause to shoot anyone,"" according to Hamilton, the law enforcement officer who was then off-duty. Reeves responded by pointing his finger at her and saying, according to Hamilton, ""You shut your f**king mouth and don't say another word."" The off-duty corporal said that at one point, Reeves pushed back his glasses and said out loud, ""Holy f**k, what have I done?"" Defense attorney Richard Escobar challenged each of these prosecution witnesses. For some, he said their recollections may be cloudy due to witnesses' vantage points, eyesight or the theater's dim lighting. Escobar also sought to portray the larger, younger Oulson as imposing compared to Reeves. His client, Reeves, remains behind bars pending the outcome of this hearing.","Witness: Oulson asked to text his daughter's babysitter, then got upset .

"Editor's note: Campbell Brown anchors CNN's ""Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull"" at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays. She delivered this commentary during the ""Cutting through the Bull"" segment of Wednesday night's broadcast. CNN's Campbell Brown says it's the media's job to be annoying to the president-elect. (CNN) -- It goes without saying, the media is annoying. It is the media's job to be annoying. Especially those members of the media assigned to cover the president. Or in this case the president-elect. Their role is not to support President-elect Barack Obama, but to challenge him, to do their best to hold him accountable. This week the media is no doubt annoying Obama with daily questions about Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich allegedly trying to sell Obama's Senate seat and the role of certain members of Obama's team. Here was the exchange he had Tuesday with a reporter from the Chicago Tribune: . John McCormick: You told us at your first press conference after the election that you were going to take a very hands-off approach to filling that spot. Over the weekend, The Tribune reported that Rahm Emanuel, your incoming chief of staff, had presented a list of potential names.  Watch Campbell Brown's commentary » . Obama: John, let me just cut you off, because I don't want you to waste your question. As I indicated yesterday, we've done a full review of this. The facts are going to be released next week. It would be inappropriate for me to comment, because the -- for example, the story that you just talked about in your own paper, I haven't confirmed that it was accurate, and I don't want to get into the details at this point. So do you have another question? Mr. President-elect, this is the second time I have observed you doing this. Cutting off a reporter because the question didn't suit you. Mr. President-elect, this sort of approach reminds a lot of us of the current administration now packing up to go, and it frankly doesn't fly in a democracy. You don't get to choose the questions you get asked at a news conference. That's not the way it works, even with a media that many believe has been more than friendly toward you, which makes it all the more surprising that you could act testy, annoyed or intolerant of any question you get. You have an extraordinarily high approval rating right now. People in this country who voted against you are pulling for you. These are desperate times for many Americans and most of this country wants you to succeed. But you will not succeed if you discard the very ideals you promoted during your campaign: directness, honesty, candor, transparency, openness. You've made a deal with the prosecutor to keep a lid on certain information about this investigation until next week. Fine. But that doesn't give you a blanket excuse to dismiss any and all questions associated with Blagojevich or anything else. You are the one who embraced openness, and you could stand to be a little more open to it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown.","Brown: Obama shouldn't brush off reporters asking about Blagojevich .

"Video, whether it's a natural sound package (see below, with editing tips from CNN's Merv Teo), an interview, ""B-roll,"" or a simple sound bite, is the hallmark of multimedia production. Two veterans of CNN photojournalism, Mark ""Mad Dog"" Biello and Chris Hrubesh, share their tips below. After reading these, CNN iReport would like you to participate in this week's boot camp project, by profiling a person who works with his or her hands. • Shoot in series . Give a variety of shots to the viewer: a wide shot to establish the scene, medium shot to bring the viewer closer, and a close-up to reveal the action. You can mix this up too, starting a sequence with the close-up instead. • Hold your shots . Always hold your shots for at least five seconds at the beginning and five seconds at the end. This technique will give our viewers a ""less jarring experience"" and make it easier to edit later. • Use a tripod or mono-pod . Nothing distracts viewers more than shaky or lopsided video. You can purchase an inexpensive tripod to correct these problems. The more expensive a tripod is, the more control you have over your camera shots. A tripod with a fluid head will allow you to accomplish the smoothest zooms, tilts, and pans. • Limit your zooms and pans . All of us have been guilty of overusing zooms and pans, but you must resist this temptation. These moves should only be used on tripods. If you have time, practice the zoom or pan before you start rolling. Try to focus more on getting wide, medium, and (my favorite) close-up shots. Try to physically move closer to your subject instead of zooming if possible. If you do zoom, try to stick to your optical zoom, not your digital zoom. Digital zoom looks bad and should only be used if your subject is out of your normal camera range. • Have a foreground subject . It is always interesting to have an object or subject in the foreground. For example, when shooting the exterior of a house, use the mailbox in the foreground for a more dramatic look, or pan from the mailbox to the house. • Use manual controls, if possible . If you have a ""prosumer camera,"" use the manual controls instead of the automatic if you have the time. Automatic focus and auto iris can distract from the quality of your video if the subject or light is constantly changing location and intensity. To do a proper manual focus, zoom all the way in to your subject (before recording) get your focus, and zoom out. If you are interviewing someone, zoom in to their eyes and set your focus. If you don't do this, your subject with be ""soft"" which is out of focus. • Get a variety of angles and shots . Only showing wide or medium shots will get boring quickly. Try to vary your shots. Always get a wide or establishing shot, then try to get in close to the action and get close-ups without interfering with the story. • Don't talk while shooting ""B-roll"" Do not --- I repeat --- do not talk while you are shooting awesome footage (or ""B-roll,"" a.k.a. supplemental or alternate footage). We need to hear the natural sound of the event and not your commentary. If you talk during the event, the viewers will lose that sound, and we would generally lower or edit out your commentary if it distracts from the video. • Use a microphone when interviewing someone . Even though camera mics will do in a breaking news situation, wireless lavaliere or stick mics are the tools of choice for good storytelling (if you have a DV cam, it is wise to invest in a wireless system, for use with interviews or following a subject around without having to hold a mic). If possible, use a windscreen to keep out wind noise and audio pops from your subject. • Have the interview subject restate the question . For example: If you ask how does this machine work?"" have the subject answer, ""Well, the machine works in this way...."" iReport: Put your video skills to work . • Get to know the subject before rolling tape . Furthermore, when conducting any interview, always start with the person's full name, spelling and if appropriate, where are they from and what they do for a living. The name is very important to CNN iReport producers and for air. Also, never ask a question that can be answered with a simple ""yes"" or ""no."" Ask a question like, ""Can you describe to me what you saw?"" Have them describe the details and their personal feelings. • Use a camera light for indoor interviews . If you are shooting indoors and the light is low, use a camera (bat light). You should ideally have one with a dimmer but these can get pretty pricey. When you are shooting outdoors, always have the sun to your back and your subject facing the sun if possible. Making sure people's faces are lit will help them stand out from their background. • Bring extra batteries and media for every shoot . As they say in the Boy Scouts, ""Be prepared."" Make sure your batteries are fully charged and you have plenty of extra videotapes or media before you head out there and get your extraordinary video. Purchase a decent camera case to protect your camera that also has room for your extra batteries and media. • Be creative . You don't have to reinvent video production, but be observant and try to find shots that you don't normally see on the air. These 10 basic tips should help you improve the quality of your video submissions in the future. I also recommend watching CNN programming and gleaning basic composition and lighting techniques.

"Ukraine's President returned to work Monday after four days of sick leave as neighbor Russia called on protesters who have tried to curb his powers to stop their ""threats and ultimatums."" President Viktor Yanukovych, who went on sick leave last Thursday for ""acute respiratory disease,"" is seeking a way out of a deepening political crisis that has paralyzed Kiev, the capital. Thousands of anti-government demonstrators have packed Kiev's Independence Square since November, underscoring tensions in a country split between pro-European regions in the west and a more Russia-oriented east. Last week, in the first concessions made by the government, the Prime Minister and Cabinet resigned, a controversial anti-protest law was repealed, and Yanukovych signed off on a contested amnesty bill for anti-government protesters. But opposition leaders, who have received backing from the U.S. and EU governments, are pressing for more concessions. In a statement Monday, Russia's Foreign Ministry told protesters who have set up tents and barricades in the central Independence Square to halt their ""provocative steps."" It said one protest leader's calls for street patrols and the blocking of public buildings ""contradicted statements about the opposition's commitment to the democratic and European values."" ""We hope the opposition in Ukraine will renounce threats and ultimatums and activate a dialogue with the government to solve the severe crisis,"" the ministry said. Special session in Parliament . Yanukovych's online press service said Sunday that he was now feeling ""good"" after treatment and his condition had been assessed as ""satisfactory."" It said he would return to his desk Monday. The government's attempts to crack down on the protests appear only to have strengthened the opposition's resolve. Violent confrontations flared after a sweeping anti-protest law was signed two weeks ago, followed by an uneasy standoff on the streets as the battle in the political arena has heated up. Yanukovych has resisted calls for him to step down and defended the government's handling of the political crisis. However, opposition parties continue to call for constitutional reforms to shift power away from the President and say a new amnesty bill -- which comes into force only if protesters vacate seized government buildings and unblock roads and squares -- is unacceptable. A special parliamentary session is scheduled for Tuesday. Activist treated in Lithuania . Deadly clashes last month were an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn a planned trade deal with the European Union and favor Russia instead. He and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on a $15 billion deal for Russia to buy Ukrainian debt and slash the price of natural gas. The violence on the streets has raised alarm among Ukraine's neighbors and Western governments, who have been calling for a peaceful resolution to the unrest. Western leaders last week also voiced growing concern about reports of the kidnapping and torture of opposition activists in the country. One, the visibly battered Dmytro Bulatov, reappeared Thursday, more than a week after he went missing. He told reporters he'd been kidnapped and tortured by his captors -- who, he said, ""crucified me"" by piercing his hands -- before they dumped him in a forest. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and White House press secretary Jay Carney condemned his cruel treatment. Ukraine's Interior Ministry has said it is investigating what happened to him. Bulatov on Sunday flew to Lithuania for medical treatment, protest leaders said.","Ukrainian President returns to his desk after a four-day sick leave .

"Washington (CNN) -- The screen is black and white. A little girl, no taller than the weeds that surround her, stands in a field and picks petals from a delicate daisy. She quietly counts each one. Suddenly an ominous voice can be heard counting down from 10. She looks up as the camera zooms in on her face, all the way into her iris. And then the unthinkable happens: A mushroom cloud. Sunday marked the 50th anniversary of the famous ""Daisy"" ad run by Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign. The aim of the one-minute spot, widely known as the first political attack ad, was to frame Republican Barry Goldwater as a warmonger. ""No one had attacked anyone like that before,"" said Robert Mann, a Louisiana State University professor who literally wrote the book about the Daisy ad. ""It was a pretty strong, implicit charge -- that my opponent is a reckless cowboy who will destroy your children in a nuclear holocaust."" The end of the spot, which never even mentions Goldwater or shows his image, encourages viewers to vote for Johnson. It aired only once, during an NBC broadcast of the film ""David and Bathsheba,"" as part of the network's popular ""Monday Night at the Movies."" An estimated 50 million viewers were watching, not a bad return on the $25,000 spent by Johnson's campaign. The 'Daisy' spot and five other compelling political ads . While advertising for everyday products such as cleaning supplies had already shifted into a creative realm by that point, political advertising was still intellectually based, Mann noted. It was heavy on facts, light on ethos. ""It was sort of seen as unseemly to advertise a politician like a bar of soap,"" said Mann, the author of ""Daisy Petals and Mushroom Clouds."" Capitalizing on emotions . But the advertising giant responsible for the Johnson ad, Doyle Dane Bernbach, understood what made people buy things -- and ideas. ""You can't give people enough facts to fall in love with you, you got to move them to fall in love with you,"" Mann said. ""The only way to do that is to make it emotional."" And one of the most prevalent emotions in September 1964, less than two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis, was fear. ISIS fighter featured in Republican campaign ad . Goldwater had listed the use of small nuclear weapons as a possible way to defoliate parts of the Vietnam jungle and destroy key infrastructure used by communist guerrillas. He tried backing away from those comments, saying he wasn't necessarily advocating such tactics. But Democrats had already seized on the language to help drive part of their narrative against the candidate. ""It was almost like a crusade not to have Goldwater become president,"" said Sidney Myers, the creative director at Dane Doyle Bernbach at the time who helped make the ad. ""We just did what we usually do: We take a product, we tell the truth about it in an unusual way."" And Republicans fought back, protesting over what they considered a grossly misleading attack against Goldwater. That in part helped spurred media coverage for the rest of the week, with all three news networks airing the ad. Experts say it was the first example of a political spot becoming a news event. ""It was a commercial that went viral before there was a 'viral,' "" said Drew Babb, an advertising creative director who teaches political ads at American University. An ad is born . So how did they come up with the idea? The firm was hired by the Democratic National Committee to work on a series of 27 anti-Goldwater ads, five of which focused on nuclear warfare. Myers, now 82, said he was listening to soundtracks of children with sound engineer Tony Schwartz, another mastermind behind the Daisy ad, and they came across sound of a child counting from one to 10. ""We decided that would be a great symbol to use,"" he recalled. ""That symbol of a child counting, then a voice of doom melding into the child's voice -- a great symbol to show that this is what could happen to a child."" Myers said he was inspired by a 1954 French film, ""The 400 Blows,"" by director FranÃ§ois Truffaut. To show that a child had died in the movie, the director froze the shot on the child and zoomed into the child's face. The Daisy ad was actually shot in a residential field in Manhattan, he said, adding that it took about two hours and 15 to 20 takes to get the shot they wanted from the little girl, child actress Monique Luiz. Big spending group goes up again in 2014 ad wars . Now 53, Luiz said she barely recalls anything from the shoot. She was about 3 and only remembers her mother taking her to a daisy field. Her parents -- one a fan of Goldwater and the other of Johnson -- had no idea their daughter would be featured in a political spot. ""And so when it aired, I remembered them saying 'Oh my gosh. It's a political ad for Johnson!' "" she said. ""And then there was all the backlash. I remember my grandmother speaking about it and being concerned that it was so harsh."" Harry Reid push called 'un-American' in new ad . When Luiz moved to Phoenix -- home of the Goldwater's department store -- about 20 years after the ad, she warily avoided the chain, worried she might be found out. ""My grandmother had instilled this fear in me that I shouldn't comment to people that I'm the Daisy girl because, you know, it wasn't necessarily a good thing that I was in that ad,"" she said. Because the spot aired only once and Luiz was a toddler at the time, she never saw the full thing until 2000, when she was in a technical college course and her professor asked the class to look up videos online. Luiz admitted she's not a fan of all the attention the ad has brought over the past 50 years, nor does she feel ""completely proud"" that the commercial set a precedent for what's become five decades of increasingly negative political ads. ""I don't really like that part of it,"" she said. ""But, you know, it's part of my life and part of my history."" Hillary Clinton is front and center in House super PAC ad .","Lyndon B.

"Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal has named a 32-member ""severe weather warning and preparedness task force"" that will recommend how the state can better respond to storms like the one that paralyzed Atlanta last week. Deal came under fire for his slow reaction to the storm that dropped 2.6 inches of snow on the Atlanta area that seemed to catch authorities off guard. The exodus of drivers from Atlanta clogged the highways, stranding thousands of students in schools and forcing numerous commuters to spend extra hours inside their cars on icy roads. The governor apologized to the public and promised to handle things differently next time.  ""I'm the governor, the buck stops with me,"" he said. The task force, composed of four local television meteorologists, other experts and school and state agency leaders, will meet in public and report to the governor 60 days after its first meeting, which has yet to be scheduled. State agency heads are scheduled to deliver an internal report to Deal in 10 days, the governor's office said. Other changes will happen right away. ""Effective immediately, a storm warning will trigger a message to cell phones in targeted areas, as in the Amber Alert system, and advise against road travel,"" Deal said Monday. ""We will go one step further with school superintendents by emailing them weather condition updates, so that they have the most up-to-date information when determining whether to close schools."" The state also will overhaul its ""state emergency app,"" which will now include information such as alternative traffic routes and shelter locations, he said. On January 28, as the storm approached, people working in Atlanta started driving home to the suburbs. A massive traffic jam gripped the city, leading to commutes of more than 20 hours for countless motorists. More than 2,000 cars were abandoned on roadsides. Some employees spent the night at their workplaces, and commuters gave up trying to get home and slept in emergency shelters or even on the floors of roadside businesses. Students who weren't picked up by buses or their parents slept in their schools. Reaction was swift. The public lashed out at Deal and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed for not acting quickly enough. Journalists sharply questioned Deal and Reed. ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""The Daily Show With Jon Stewart"" mocked Georgia and Atlanta. Reed, who works closely with Deal, also said he'll respond more aggressively when bad weather strikes. ""We're going to be as prepared as we can to be ready for the next storm,"" Deal told reporters.

"You squirt it on your hands as you catch the office elevator for lunch, and then again on your way home. You have bottles in your bathroom and kitchen, too -- and you use them often. You think (hope?) that your hand-sanitizer habit is protecting you from colds and flu and gross bugaboos like E. coli. But even if it isn't, it's harmless. Right? The rumor: Hand sanitizer is not only ineffective, it's toxic . Word on the street has it that despite how clean your hands feel after using a hand sanitizer, they're actually still dirty -- and using sanitizers might actually lower your resistance to disease. Is it true?! upwave: Is it true that an apple a day keeps the doctor away? The verdict: Soap and water beats sanitizers hands-down . When it comes to safety and effectiveness, the main concern with hand sanitizers is triclosan, which is the main antibacterial ingredient in nonalcoholic hand sanitizers. ""There's no good evidence that triclosan-containing products have a benefit,"" says Allison Aiello, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan. In Europe and the United States, hospitals won't even use them, she notes; it's thought that they don't reduce infections or illness. Dr. Anna Bowen, a medical epidemiologist at The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says, ""Triclosan-containing products don't provide any disease protection beyond what you get from washing with soap and water."" Research has shown that triclosan can disrupt the endocrine system, amplifying testosterone. In animal studies, it reduced muscle strength. It may also harm the immune system. Whether these findings add up to human toxicity isn't established yet, but the FDA is currently reviewing the issue. upwave: How to prevent getting sick when you travel . A more established concern: ""When you expose bacteria to triclosan, it can elicit antibiotic resistance,"" says Aiello. ""Once the resistance is transferred, [pathogenic] bacteria can become resistant to many types of antibiotics."" (Quaternary ammonium, another antibacterial found in nonalcoholic hand sanitizers, has also been shown to elicit antibiotic resistance, she says.) The main concern with triclosan, however, is that it doesn't protect against viruses or fungi. ""Colds are caused by viruses, not bacteria,"" Aiello points out. Bottom line? Skip it. Alcohol-based sanitizers, on the other hand, are fairly effective and safe. ""Hand sanitizers that are 60% alcohol are good at killing bacterial pathogens,"" says Bowen. They can also kill some viruses, but not all of them -- such as the noroviruses that can cause cruise-ship outbreaks. ""They're not a panacea, but if you can't wash your hands, a squirt of an alcohol-based hand gel is a good idea,"" she says. Adds Aiello, ""If you can't get to a sink quickly, an alcohol-based sanitizer is a good alternative [to washing with soap and water]."" One caveat: They don't work on visibly dirty hands -- the alcohol can't get past the dirt. upwave: Get dangerous germs out of your home . And that brings us back to soap and water -- which is both safe and effective. Try to suds up after you use the toilet and before you prepare food; studies show that doing so can drastically reduce the risk of diarrhea. ""Hand-washing campaigns reduce absenteeism in schools,"" says Bowen, ""and that means parents miss fewer days of work, too."" To see these effects, though, you have to wash your hands correctly. ""You need to wash for about 24 seconds to remove the bacteria and viruses from your hands,"" says Aiello. ""Most people don't wash their hands properly. You need to cover all parts of your hands, including under your nails -- and then dry your hands well."" How long is 24 seconds? About as long as it takes to sing the ""Happy Birthday"" song two times through. So feel free to do that as you suds up.

"Washington is entering a new era of kamikaze governance, this time with Democrats at the helm. Thursday night's spending showdown saw progressive Democrats unexpectedly emerge as the agitators ready to drive the nation off a cliff to win concessions — and progressives say it will happen again. ""The fight last night was a shot across the bow that progressives are ready to stand and fight, and there are millions of Americans ready to jump into the fray,"" Ben Wikler, Washington director for MoveOn.org, a progressive group, said on Sunday. Progressive members of the Democratic Party are gearing up for what they expect to be many battles needed to defend their values as Republicans seek to chip away at a variety of Democratic priorities when they take control of Congress next year. A prime example of such skirmishes came last week. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren objected to a GOP provision -- attached to a broad spending bill -- that rolled back a key portion of the Wall Street reform law. Her opposition prompted dozens of Democrats to defect and triggered a last-minute scramble for support; President Barack Obama himself made calls to win lawmakers back and stave off a potential government shutdown. The spending bill eventually passed the Senate on Saturday night and on Sunday, Democratic leaders downplayed a possible rift within the party. But the nearly 2,000 progressive activists and operatives who descended on Washington over the weekend for the annual Rootscamp gathering felt otherwise. Panels addressed things like #HillaryProblems and the lack of understanding between the grassroots and establishment wings of the Democratic Party. And panelists and attendees alike endorsed the newly antagonistic moves from their elected officials this week. ""How do we make change in general, as we're seeing from the streets of DC to Ferguson to New York? I do think that sometimes you have to shut it down,"" said Alana Krivo-Kaufman, a 27-year-old Rootscamp attendee and an organizer with Jewish Voice for Peace. And with Republicans taking control of the Senate next month, the imperative for progressives to hold their ground on key issues could grow ever more urgent. Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and former Senate leadership aide, said Republicans have given every indication they'll attempt to use a series of upcoming deadlines, including the need to raise the debt ceiling next year, to peel back Democratic policies passed under Obama. ""What we saw just now is just a taste of what's to come for two years,"" he said. Obama's standing within the party diminished . And Democrats no longer feel beholden to their de facto leader — the President — as he enters the final, lame-duck years of his presidency. Some now openly admit he's going to have to navigate a difficult terrain within his own party in the new Congress. Jeremy Bird, the former national field director for Obama's re-election campaign, told CNN the left is still adjusting to the new political landscape. ""Everybody's sort of figuring it out, post-midterms, how it's all going to shake out,"" he said of Obama's leadership role among Democrats. ""I'm sure there'll be other disagreements. And it's a different world with a Republican Senate and a Republican House."" Many progressives are frustrated with what they believe has been too much waffling from the President and other Democratic leaders on the issues that matter most to the base -- behavior they argue contributed to their losses in the midterms. ""All the Democrats who lost were ones who ran to the center,""  Krivo-Kaufman said, echoing a frequent refrain heard from panelists at Rootscamp. That frustration has fueled a progressive backlash against the more moderate dealmakers in the party, and is what's made Warren so attractive to so many, her supporters believe. Erica Sagrans, who heads a grassroots super PAC working to draft Warren to run for President, said the issue with candidates in the midterm was they were ""afraid"" to stand on their principles. ""We can't have candidates who are afraid to take risks and say what they believe in and stand up for something,"" she said. ""You can't just have these Democrats who are everything to everyone and play things very safe and are picked by party insiders to not offend anyone."" Sagrans said the watered down soundbites are meaningless to voters, whereas, ""Warren's style of being unafraid of who she is, of being honest, of speaking up"" resonates. Campaign-trail fallout . The elevation of Warren as a prominent figure in these policy fights, and of Wall Street reform as a key issue for progressives, is certain to put former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a difficult spot as she prepares for a potential presidential bid. More than 300 former Obama campaign staffers signed a letter urging Warren to run for President this week. Clinton, meanwhile, continues to face skepticism from progressives who believe she's too cozy with Wall Street. And while Warren has repeatedly said she's not interested in a run, her supporters believe even having her in the mix, and focusing the conversation on Wall Street reform, could help shape Clinton's potential candidacy. Indeed, the activity surrounding Warren, and the emerging rift within the party, had even Democratic Party officials on Friday predicting a spirited primary battle for the presidential nomination. ""Regardless of who decides to run, we're gonna have a really competitive and interesting primary process,"" said Matt Compton, the Democratic National Committee's digital director.","A bruising midterm election has prompted a backlash from progressives in Congress .
They see Elizabeth Warren, not President Barack Obama, as their leader .

"A spectacular meteor shower delighted and awed skyward eyes over the weekend in the Northern Hemisphere.

Geminids -- so-named because they appear to come out of the Gemini constellation, explained the chat moderator -- are debris from an extinct comet called 3200 Phaethon, which was previously believed to be an asteroid, according to NASA. ""Basically it is the rocky skeleton of a comet that lost its ice after too many close encounters with the sun,"" NASA said on its website. The light show comes around annually in mid-December, when the Earth encounters debris from 3200 Phaethon. Earlier in the week, NASA said the Geminids were expected to peak just before dawn Saturday ""with a predicted peak rate of 100 to 120 meteors per hour.""","Geminid meteor shower peaked Saturday night .

"The obscure banking provision that threatened to derail the recently passed government funding measure was derided by Democrats as a sop to Wall Street. But some on the left have a John Kerry-esque problem with the ""Boehner Bank Bailout"" -- they were for it before they were against it. At issue, was the so-called push-out regulation, which was designed to prevent banks from using government insured money to make risky investments -- like the loan swaps that fueled the 2008 financial crisis. Buried inside the 1,600-page spending proposal to keep the government running is a small provision to end that prohibition. Democrats were livid. But last fall, that same proposal was considered by the Republican-controlled House. The bill, the majority of which was written by Citigroup and other Wall Street banks, passed with the support of 70 Democrats. On Thursday, 28 House Democrats seemingly changed their mind, voting against the spending bill that included the rollback provision -- a provision that became the rallying cry for progressive Democrats hoping to kill the bill. Of course, the massive legislation gives lawmakers lots of potential explanations for why they changed their votes. But whatever the explanation, in politics, it's still scored as a flip-flop. Many progressive Democrats complained that the rollback was snuck into the bill at the last minute. Not true, said Republican and Democratic sources familiar with the negotiations. It had been an issue for weeks. On the House floor, California Rep. Maxine Waters blasted the rollback as a danger to consumers. ""They know that we bailed out the big banks and know that we would be putting them at risk one more time to bail them out if we allow them to do this risky derivatives trading,"" she said. The top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, Waters urged her colleagues to vote against the spending bill unless Republicans removed the regulatory rollback. She was shocked to learn that both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were calling lawmakers asking them to pass the bill. But just two years ago, Waters supported a proposal that would have done exactly the same thing she opposed last week, allowing banks to buy risky financial instruments with government backed money. Back then, even Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, whose name is on the Wall Street reform law, supported the rollback. Waters evolution on the issue started a year and a half ago - in the wake of a high profile scandal involving a trader known as the ""London Whale"" who engaged in swaps that generated billions in losses. She opposed the measure the House passed last fall, arguing regulations should stay in place overseeing these transactions. Waters defended her new position saying in a statement to CNN that, ""It's become clear that Wall Street derivatives trading has not yet been sufficiently reigned in by our regulators."" She says she's in good company, noting that Frank, who has since retired from Congress, has changed his position and supports barring banks from using government-backed money on risky transactions. But the idea was never beloved by Democrats to begin with. Championed in 2010 by then-Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln as she tacked left during a tough primary fight, then-Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke -- both Obama picks -- were unsupportive. RELATED: Congress passes spending bill, avoids shutdown . So perhaps it's no wonder that the rollback became a bargaining chip. Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the spending bill's key Senate negotiator, defended the rollback arguing the legislation also boosts the budgets of regulators in charge of policing Wall Street. ""I don't want the derivative market to go wild. This is not the Wild West. We made sure that we put money in the federal checkbook,"" she said on the Senate floor Friday. ""Agencies that are in charge with enforcing the rules to protect against abuse are funded."" Democrats agreed to kill the swaps regulation in return for Republicans agreeing to increase the budgets of two financial regulators, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and taking other changes to the Wall Street reform bill off the table, according to multiple government and industry sources. A Democratic Senate aide said the financial agencies' funding levels were negotiated separately and had ""nothing to do"" with negotiating the rollback legislation. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday it was hard ""to account for all of the conversations that took place"" while the White House and lawmakers were negotiating the spending bill. But a financial services lobbyist noted that nobody on either side of the aisle wants credit for helping banks. ""Everybody had enough deniability that they were OK with it,"" the lobbyist said. ""There was no press release going out about it.""","Some Democrats are complaining about a Wall Street regulatory rollback included in the recently passed spending measure .
But many supported the very same provision in previous legislation .

"When you first hear his pitch, it defies logic: Mitch McConnell, a 30-year veteran of the Senate, campaigning for re-election as an agent of change. ""If you want change, if you're unhappy with the direction of this country, the candidate of change is the guy you're looking at,"" McConnell told an audience at a Chamber of Commerce lunch here. 72-year-old McConnell -- the top Senate Republican -- is running against a 35-year-old Democrat who has never had an elected job in D.C. But he's the change candidate? Well, if you're a voter with an unfavorable view of President Barack Obama -- and according to a new CNN/Opinion Research International Poll, that's about two-thirds of Kentucky voters -- McConnell's argument has appeal once he explains it. He says the only real option for altering the balance of power in Washington is a GOP Senate takeover on Election Day -- and putting him in charge. ""The only thing they can do in 2014 to begin to change the direction of the country is to change the makeup of the Senate,"" McConnell told CNN. ""In this country, the way you change things is at the ballot box. And so there's only one thing that can be done this year to begin to lead America in a different direction and it begins right here in Kentucky,"" he tells voters on the stump. McConnell wants to be Senate Majority Leader so badly he can taste it, especially after two straight election cycles of seeing the role within his reach, but snatched away largely because of bruising intra-GOP fights and Republican candidate missteps. Kentucky U.S. Senate race is one the key ones this year . I reminded McConnell of the old joke about senators, that most of them look in the mirror and see the next president. ""I never had that problem. I never had that affliction,"" McConnell chuckled. ""You have always wanted to be the majority leader of the Senate, is that fair to say?"" I asked. ""I would like to have the chance to be the majority leader of the Senate, yes,"" he replied. Toughest challenge in years . But to lead the Senate, he has to win re-election first, and McConnell is facing his toughest challenge in years in Alison Lundergan Grimes. Grimes would be Kentucky's first female senator.  Currently Kentucky's secretary of state, she has a well-financed campaign, thanks to the national implications and importance of her race. She's gotten high-profile help from former President Bill Clinton, a family friend. In many ways she is running a textbook campaign for a challenger trying to unseat an entrenched incumbent, especially a Democrat versus Republican. She paints McConnell as out of touch with the folks back home, and the personification of Washington dysfunction. ""I don't know whether to call Sen. McConnell Sen. No-Show, Sen. Gridlock or Sen. Shutdown,"" Grimes says to a crowd gathered for a political picnic in Owensboro. ""What I do know is that he's not working for Kentucky. Kentucky is all ready for someone whose vocabulary goes beyond the word 'no.' When it comes to increasing the minimum wage and giving hardworking Kentuckians a fighting chance, Mitch McConnell says no. Kentucky is ready for a senator who says it's not just a minimum wage, it's a living wage. When it comes to the women of this state being treated equally, Mitch McConnell says no,"" Grimes says. McConnell: 'Remember me? I am the guy that gets us out of shutdowns' That appears to be resonating with some voters here, even one who has supported McConnell over the years. ""We're just tired of McConnell. His only objective is to -- anything Obama's done, he's against it,"" Owensboro voter Margaret Willett said. But others in the crowd disagreed, especially voters like Keith Herm who dislike the President. ""I believe the seniority he will hold in the Senate will be monumental,"" Herm said about McConnell. ""There are some issues with Obama I would like to see changed, and hopefully he can do that."" Grimes' biggest challenge is unshackling herself from  Obama, who won only four of Kentucky's 120 counties in 2012. It's not easy, when McConnell's working so hard to link Grimes to the President. ""Mitch McConnell, well, he wants to make this race about anyone but me, trying to tie me to every national figure that's out there that disagrees with Kentucky's interests. Barack Obama isn't on the ballot; I am,"" Grimes told voters. Democrats have been banking on the fact that the President may be unpopular here, but so is McConnell -- he is well known, and not well liked. The trouble for Grimes is that as she becomes better known, and put through the grind of this intense campaign, her favorable ratings are dipping, too. A strikingly stark contrast in styles . Like any candidate, McConnell and Grimes each have pluses and minuses, but these two have a strikingly stark contrast in style. McConnell is the ultimate political tactician and old school, bring-home-the-bacon senator. When it was his turn to speak at the Owensboro picnic, McConnell made a point of reminding residents here he secured $50 million to renovate the riverfront, which transformed the town. It's the kind of earmark the tea party hates. He never would have spoken about it during his GOP primary fight, but it is front and center in the general election campaign against a Democrat. ""I'm proud I did it for you. It's changed this community and we'll do it again,"" said McConnell, not mentioning that the kind of earmarks that rebuilt the riverfront are now banned in the Senate. But McConnell's aides are the first to admit he is not a natural campaigner. He doesn't connect in the grip and grin settings many politicians love. It's not his thing. Grimes, on the other hand, appears energized by pressing the flesh with voters.  She moved around the Owensboro picnic introducing herself and talking to voters with ease. And on the stump she can project and deliver lines powerfully. But in interviews, she often appears stilted and scripted. Case in point: When I asked Grimes point blank for some ""Kentucky candor"" about how much of a drag the President is on her campaign, she replied with a generic talking point. ""I think that Kentuckians are seeing this race for what it is, a chance to actually move Kentucky forward in the right direction,"" Grimes said. Bound to get very ugly . This is expected to be the most expensive Senate race in history, north of $100 million. And the mud is already flying. McConnell's campaign manager Jesse Benton abruptly resigned late last week because of a bribery scandal surrounding Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign. Grimes' campaign is already pushing a Web ad highlighting Benton's departure. But that may be because McConnell's campaign released an ad of its own whacking Grimes, accusing her of getting a sweetheart deal for her campaign bus -- brokered by her father, a prominent businessman and former state party chair. ""They're baseless, unfounded, bullying accusations from Mitch McConnell,"" Grimes said of the allegations. And then there's a secret audio recording that surfaced of McConnell speaking at a Koch brothers donor meeting, vowing not to allow votes on Democratic initiatives. It was released right before our interview, and Grimes was eager to jump on it as McConnell's ""47% Mitt Romney moment."" ""I think it shows the extent and the lengths he will go to pander to his party millionaires and billionaires at the expense of hurting Kentuckians,"" Grimes said of the McConnell audio. As for McConnell, he brushed it off, because he has made it no secret he intends to block the President's agenda. ""I didn't say anything in the private meeting I haven't said publicly."" McConnell told me. McConnell, the Democrats and the limits of a secret tape . That may be, but a muffled recording of a secret meeting with fat cat GOP donors is less than ideal for McConnell. These are end-of-summer stumbles for both candidates, in the marquee race of the year, bound to get very ugly.","McConnell could become majority leader if he wins his Senate election .

"Guys, I think he means it. With no clear frontrunner or obvious ""next-in-line"" candidate in the field of potential 2016 GOP presidential contenders, Mitt Romney keeps getting asked if he's thinking about throwing his hat in the ring one more time. But it's not entirely a far-fetched question. A poll of New Hampshire Republicans and independents who lean that way found that Romney would be the 2016 frontrunner if he decided to run. The 2012 GOP nominee has done little to stay out of the limelight, especially this year, as he gets involved in numerous races — including GOP primaries — and keeps up a fairly regular routine of media appearances. He has assumed a sort of party elder role, and just finished hosting close to 300 major donors and politicians at his third annual Park City retreat. He was asked as recently as last week on ""Meet the Press"" if he would still turn down another presidential bid -- even if drafted.

"The United Kingdom will deploy hundreds of troops to Iraq in the coming year to train Iraqi and Kurdish forces -- the country's latest contribution to the fight against ISIS -- British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon told The Telegraph newspaper. The British have participated in a multinational airstrike campaign against ISIS in Iraq for months, but sending troops to train Iraqis and Kurds increases Britain's military involvement there. The United Kingdom hasn't had a significant ground troop presence in Iraq since 2011, the same year the United States withdrew its forces following a 2003 invasion to topple Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. British troops will begin training Iraqi and Kurdish forces in January, Fallon told the Telegraph for a story published Saturday. The number of troops hasn't been finalized, ""but we are talking very low hundreds,"" Fallon told the Telegraph. ""Our role now, apart from the airstrikes, is increasingly going to be on training,"" Fallon said. The British Ministry of Defense told CNN on Saturday that Fallon's comments reported by the Telegraph were accurate, and that details about he deployment still were being determined. ISIS: Sex slaves are OK . The United States has hundreds of troops already in Iraq, training, advising and assisting Iraqi and Kurdish forces. In November, President Barack Obama said he was planning to send up to an additional 1,500 troops for that purpose. In October, the United States had more than 1,400 troops in Iraq, in addition to hundreds more aboard ships and in nearby countries who were helping to carry out airstrikes in Iraq. The Iraqi military and Kurdish militias have been battling ISIS, the militant group that calls itself the ""Islamic State."" The Sunni Muslim extremist group captured portions of Syria and Iraq this year in its bid to establish what it says is an independent Islamic nation. ISIS shoots down Iraqi helicopter, killing 2, official says . ISIS fighters shot down an Iraqi army helicopter in the north-central Iraqi city of Samarra this week, killing two pilots, a military command officer told CNN on Saturday. The incident happened Friday afternoon in southern Samarra, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) north-northwest of Baghdad. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the news media. The helicopter attack came two days after a suicide truck bombing killed at least nine people, including Iraqi soldiers, outside a military base in Samarra.","British troops to start training Iraqi, Kurdish forces in Iraq in January, official says .

"A Russian military intelligence plane nearly collided with a commercial passenger jet south of Sweden on Friday, the Swedish air force chief said Sunday. The incident in international airspace forced the passenger flight en route from Denmark to Sweden to change course, Maj. Gen. Micael Byden said. But the Russian Defense Ministry refuted the notion that one of its warplanes nearly collided with a passenger jet. And a spokesman for Scandinavian Airlines said reports of danger to the plane or passengers were ""blown out of proportion."" Knut Morten Johansen said the flight wasn't forced to change course, but that the pilot took normal advice from air traffic control. ""No security borders were breached,"" he said, adding that it was a ""totally safe flight."" Byden said Swedish fighter jets were immediately deployed to identify the aircraft and later determined it was a Russian intelligence plane. He said the Russian military aircraft's transponders were turned off to avoid commercial radar. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman maintained the flight was a safe distance from civilian aircraft. ""No prerequisites existed for an air accident related with a flight of a Russian warplane in the international air space over the Baltic Sea on Friday,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Sunday, according to Russia's state-run TASS news agency. ""The flight was being made strictly in compliance with international air space rules, not violating borders of other countries and at a safe distance from traffic routes of civilian aircraft,"" he said. Konashenkov said the Russian plane was more than 70 kilometers (44 miles) from the flight route of a passenger jet.

"Brazil thought its nightmare was over -- but perhaps it's only just beginning. After the humiliation of being obliterated by Germany, those who had dreamed of a Brazilian World Cup triumph might have thought they would be left alone to quietly lick their words or perhaps console themselves with a sombre walk along the shores of the Copacabana. Alas, such a luxury will not be afforded to them -- not now at least. Instead neighbors Argentina will launch an invasion of Rio Sunday hoping to start their own party in its arch rival's back yard. This was the result which Brazil feared -- the scenario it never wanted to face, to have Argentina, its oldest foe, walk out at the Maracana on Sunday just 90 minutes away becoming world champions. While Brazil had leaked goals in its shambolic defeat by Germany, Argentina displayed true grit and then calm under pressure in a penalty shootout to book its place in the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years -- the fifth in its history. Don't bother telling those with their faces painted blue and white that was a tepid and insipid encounter. They're probably still jumping up and down with joy -- while celebrating Argentinian Independence Day like never before. ""I'm very happy because we reached the final and now we will see what we can do,"" Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella told reporters. ""We will give everything as usual, with humility, work and 100% effort."" A goalless 120 minutes was enough to bore most to tears but when Maxi Rodriguez struck the decisive penalty kick to win the shootout 4-2, the march to Rio began and Brazil closed its eyes. For the third time, Argentina will play Germany in the final having won in 1986 and lost in 1990 -- but regardless of the opposition, it will surely need to improve on this performance. Lionel Messi, the man who has inspired Argentina on so many occasions, was almost anonymous but he was not the only one to disappear. This game was a case of going from the sublime to the ridiculous as the sequel to Germany's dominant display over Brazil was temporarily forgotten as these two sides served up one of the poorest offerings of the tournament. It was dire -- so dire you had to keep pinching yourself that this was actually a World Cup semifinal. For all the talent on the field, the inability to keep possession, deliver a cross or even manage a simple pass proved beyond those on show. Often such games are classed as 'intriguing', 'tactical' or 'chess like' but none of those descriptions fitted -- file this under dreadful and error-strewn. Neither side deserved to win and penalties looked the most likely outcome from the offset -- a stark contrast to Germany's 7-1 thrashing of Brazil on Tuesday. While the goals flowed like Caipirinhas in the bars of Belo Horizonte, Sao Paulo provided a far more sober affair. Tight, tense and turgid in the first half, both sides struggled to create a chance of note with space at a premium. Messi, so often Argentina's leading light, fizzed a free kick at goal which Jasper Cillessen did well to save, while Ezequiel Garay's header flew just over the crossbar as the South American side briefly threatened. Messi, making his 92nd international appearance, found himself accompanied by Nigel de Jong each and every time he moved, touched the ball or dared to breathe. Previously ruled out of the tournament with a groin injury only to make a miraculous recovery in time for the contest, De Jong gave the Dutch the bite in midfield which it had missed in the quarterfinal victory over Costa Rica. But while the Dutch side was relatively untroubled in defense, it rarely threatened going forward with Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie almost anonymous. Robben, one of the outstanding players of the tournament, touched the ball just six times in the opening 45 minutes as Argentina, and Javier Mascherano in particular, kept the flying Dutchman quiet. If anybody had hoped that the fare might improve after the interval they were left sorely disappointed. Passes went astray, possession was squandered with both teams failing to provide any trace of quality in the final third. And yet with the contest at 90 minutes, the Dutch had the opportunity to win the tie in the most dramatic fashion as they attempted to reach a second successive final. Wesley Sneijder, anonymous for much of the evening, produced a fine flick to release Robben but the Bayern Munich man dallied and allowed Mascherano time to recover and block his effort. With neither side able to muster a goal, the tie moved into extra time with the Dutch appearing the more threatening. Robben's low effort forced Sergio Romero into a routine save in an otherwise unremarkable opening 15 minutes of extra time. Argentina, impotent for much of the contest with Messi superbly marshalled by the Dutch defense, rarely looked capable of finding a winner. But with five minutes of the tie remaining, it created its best chance of the contest when Maxi Rodriguez played in Rodrigo Palacio, but his header was easily dealt with by Cillessen. Penalties ensued somewhat inevitably and it was Argentina which held its nerve with goalkeeper Romero the hero. The Dutch, which had defeated Costa Rica on penalties in the previous round following the introduction of substitute goalkeeper Tim Krul, floundered under the pressure. Ron Vlaar, one of the game's outstanding performers, was thwarted by Romero, who also saved from Sneijder. In the end it was left to Rodriguez to fire Argentina into the final and get the party started -- a party which Brazil isn't invited to and one it hoped it would never have to see.","Argentina defeats the Netherlands 4-2 on penalties .

"One might think Democrats are in disarray, given the recent legislative battle that pitted the Obama administration and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid against top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Not so, argue New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and outgoing Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. ""The differences among Democrats are small compared to the huge chasm of Republicans,"" Schumer said to Candy Crowley on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""You look on issues like minimum wage and equal pay and infrastructure construction, helping people pay for college -- the Democratic Party is unified."" Schumer called economic issues ""the soul of the Democratic Party"" and reiterated his belief that party members are on the same page -- name-checking Warren, a newly minted member of the Senate Democrats' leadership team. ""Elizabeth Warren is, even if people don't agree with her, she's constructive,"" he said of the senator who advocated for Democratic opposition to a spending measure because she felt it rolled by banking regulations. ""She's not like Ted Cruz saying, 'Shut down the government or don't fund things if I don't get my way.'"" Patrick, in a separate interview with Crowley, said Democrats suffered heavy losses in the 2014 midterm elections because they lacked a resonating economic message, not because of an emerging rift. ""It's a broad-based party. We are very specific about the things that we need to do economically and socially to enable people to get a toehold in the middle class and to hang on once they get there,"" he said. ""And I think that that's a very powerful story. It is about convictions. And when we tell it, we win."" Patrick, a self-described ""pro-growth progressive"" offered support for Warren generally, but advocated for a balance between government help and private market principles. ""I just don't believe that markets solve every problem in everybody's life and I don't think government solves every problem in everybody's life,"" Patrick said. But with groups on the left envigorated by Warren's anti-Wall Street rhetoric and Pelosi willing to buck Obama's White House, there's evidence Democrats may splinter yet.","Top Democrats argue the party remains unified in wake of legislative skirmish .

"(CNN)Nations working on a global treaty to combat climate change and handle its ill effects have come to a basic draft agreement at conference in Lima, Peru. The elements hammered out in two weeks by about 190 countries at the 20th Conference of Parties (COP20) will serve as the basis for an international climate treaty to be signed in Paris next year, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change said Sunday. That treaty, which is supposed to detail nations' responsibilities in the fight against climate change, will come into effect in 2020. The Lima draft announced Sunday determines that developed countries and developing nations will take on differing responsibilities in the fight against global warming ""in light of different national circumstances."" The details of those responsibilities are to be determined later. It also calls on richer countries to help poorer ones finance their goals -- especially countries hurt most by the ""adverse effects of climate change"" that are working to mitigate that damage. Initial disagreement between nations over the distribution of responsibilities and costs had brought negotiations to a deadlock, causing the conference to be extended by two days. A handful of developed and developing countries pledged contributions to the Green Climate Fund -- designed to finance sustainable development -- boosting it to nearly $10.2 billion. CNN's Christine Theodorou contributed to his report.","The draft agreement will serve as the basis for a treaty to be signed in Paris next year .

"A Florida man accused of killing his parents with a hammer when he was 17 and then hosting a party pleaded no contest Wednesday to two counts of first-degree murder with a weapon. The move by Tyler Hadley, who previously pleaded not guilty, came less than a month before he was to stand trial for the July 2011 deaths of Blake and Mary Jo Hadley. Hadley could be sentenced, at a maximum, to life in prison without parole. A judge in Florida's St. Lucie County will hold a mitigation hearing to determine whether Hadley's youth or other factors should lead to a lesser sentence. A prosecutor told Hadley that he intends to detail the state's entire case during that hearing, and that because of this, Hadley shouldn't think that he's sparing his family the public airing of evidence in court by pleading no contest. St. Lucie Circuit Judge Robert Makemson then asked Hadley whether he wanted to change his mind about the plea. ""No, sir,"" Hadley said. Authorities said Hadley beat his parents near and in the master bedroom of their Port St. Lucie home on July 16, 2011. In Wednesday's plea hearing, the prosecution said evidence shows that Hadley had been using drugs and was upset about his parents' plans to put him into a ""day treatment program."" After killing his parents, Hadley used ""books, files, towels, anything that he could find inside the home to cover the bodies"" in the bedroom, Port St. Lucie police spokesman Tom Nichols said at the time. Before the killings, Hadley had posted on Facebook an invitation to a party at his home. Hours after the slayings, between 40 and 60 people showed up for the party, police said. Authorities received an anonymous tip and found the bodies while conducting a welfare check at the house early the next morning. Police said Hadley had dropped out of high school and had taken classes at Indian River State College.","Tyler Hadley killed parents in 2011, then held party, authorities say .

"Aurora, Colorado (CNN) -- Jesse Fraunfelder, an unemployed husband and father, shakes his head when he thinks of the salaries going to members of Congress. ""If we worked 5% of the time and 80% of the time we said: 'We're either not going to vote, we're going to scream at each other or not do our job at all,' what would happen to us?"" he asked. ""Would we be fired? I think so."" iReporter Fraunfelder lives in Aurora, Colorado. CNN selected him for this story prior to the movie theater shooting. Fraunfelder is incensed over the gridlock in Washington and blames partisan rancor for failure of Congress to compromise on issues ranging from jobs to the national debt. Disappointed and cynical as he is, however, Fraunfelder will still vote this fall. Watch behind-the-scenes interview with Fraunfelder . ""I care about my country. I vote,"" he said. ""We need to make sure they hear us, especially now."" But drive three hours from Fraunfelder's house, into the Rocky Mountains, and Roxanne Pranger is not sure if she'll vote. ""I am so discouraged with Congress and how they can't get along,"" she told CNN Radio. ""They used to sit and hash things out and that's how it should be."" Pranger, who lives in Steamboat Springs, just turned 60 last month and believes this is the most divided she has ever seen her government. ""I just feel like they're acting like kindergarteners,"" she said. According to Congressional Quarterly's annual review of votes in Congress, 2011 set a record for both the number of partisan votes (votes where a majority of one party votes against the majority of another party) and the intensity of the partisanship (the frequency that members vote with their party) in the House of Representatives. ""Right now we're seeing an increase in polarization,"" said Vanderbilt political science professor John Geer. ""At some point it will start to decrease."" Geer is more analytical than emotional about the tide of partisanship, noting that the U.S. government was designed to be contentious. ""I'm not looking for them to be members of the clergy,"" Geer told CNN Radio. ""We have two parties for a reason."" But Geer also believes there is a danger when partisanship reaches this kind of extreme level. He gave an example of how divide, and the gridlock it caused, hurt the country in the past. ""There are injustices that have unfolded in this country, namely like civil rights, that took far, far too long for those to unfold ... which is a problem with the system,"" he said. But can this change? What's your take on partisanship? Share your view with CNN iReport. ""I don't know what can get us out of it,"" Geer admitted. But he ventured an idea. ""At some point enough people like Roxanne (Pranger) need to be angry enough that maybe they don't vote, or maybe they vote for a third party,"" Geer said. For now, it is certainly possible Pranger will stay home on Election Day. She told CNN Radio that she likes President Obama, but is disheartened by negative ads on both sides, causing her to consider staying home on November 6. Listen to Fraunfelder's original story on CNN iReport . Meanwhile, Fraunfelder said he is still considering how he'll cast his vote.

"(CNN) -- A major United States military post is shutting down for three days following a rash of suicides, the post announced. Troops from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, depart for the Persian Gulf in 2003. Fort Campbell, home of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, is holding a three-day ""suicide stand-down training event"" starting Wednesday -- the second one it has held this year, a post spokeswoman told CNN. At least 11 deaths of Fort Campbell soldiers this year are confirmed or suspected suicides, spokeswoman Kelly Tyler said. That's out of 64 confirmed or suspected suicides in the entire Army, according to official statistics. At that rate, the Army is on pace for a record number of suicides this year. The post commander, Brig. Gen. Stephen Townsend, addressed all 19,000 soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division on Wednesday, Tyler said. ""His intent was to be able to look them in the eye and make them aware that everyone cares about the issue, and make sure they know -- corporal to general -- what help is available,"" she said. ""To make sure that people know we want them to keep living."" Soldiers often refuse to admit they are having problems because of the culture of the military, she said. ""You still have the stigma in the Army of asking for help -- it's an institution of strength and honor. And they need to understand that there is strength and honor in asking for help,"" Tyler said. ""It's easy to lose focus of that. We are a nation at war, an army at war. The guys around you need you to be there. They need you to ask for help, or for them to ask for help if you can't."" Fort Campbell's commanders are trying to impress upon the troops that this is more than a mandatory exercise. ""It is such an unusual event to look them in the eye and say their life matters, their buddy's life matters,"" Tyler said. ""We're not checking a box, not punching a ticket. This is an effort to let the soldiers know that the command cares."" Military suicides are among the top worries for a leading veterans' group. ""This is a grave concern for our organization,"" said Ryan Gallucci, a spokesman for AmVets. Combat stress manifests itself in different ways, he said, citing the case of a U.S. soldier charged with killing five of his comrades at a mental-health clinic in Iraq earlier this month. ""The incident in Baghdad brought a lot of attention to combat stress, but this is the other side of the coin,"" he said. He agreed that the military's emphasis on personal toughness makes it harder for soldiers to ask for help when they need it. ""Mental strength is a necessary character trait in combat. To suddenly say it's OK to admit you have a problem contradicts your training,"" he said. But he said the Army needs to do more to prevent suicide. ""The military has certainly done a better job of identifying it, but you see the numbers -- the numbers speak for themselves,"" he said. A record number of soldiers committed suicide last year -- at least 133, the Army said. That was up from at least 115 in 2007, which was itself a record since the Pentagon began keeping statistics on suicide in 1980. The statistics cover active-duty soldiers and activated National Guard and reserves.  View a chart of Army suicides » . More soldiers killed themselves in January of this year than died in battle, Army statistics suggest. Suicides for Marines were also up in 2008. There were 41 in 2008, up from 33 in 2007 and 25 in 2006, according to a Marine Corps report. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, vice chief of staff of the Army, expressed concern about the suicide rate in March testimony before the Senate Armed Services Military Personnel Subcommittee. He cited long deployments, lengthy separations from family and the perceived stigma associated with seeking help as factors contributing to the suicides. ""We must find ways to relieve some of this stress,"" Chiarelli said. Fort Campbell is on both sides of the Kentucky-Tennessee state line, southeast of Paducah, Kentucky.

"Murdock, Minnesota (CNN) -- Jannet Walsh is not waiting for the presidential candidates to encourage more jobs. Instead, the unemployed Minnesotan is trying to create one on her own. ""I think it was February, after I don't know how many (job) rejections,"" the 48-year-old told CNN Radio, the frustration still clear in her voice, ""I actually remember sitting here kind of yelling, 'This is it! This is enough!' "" That moment, Walsh decided to create her own business, a one-woman photography and media company based in her family's century-old home. With that decision, the energetic former newspaper photographer took a gamble that is central to the debates over the economy and the White House. Small businesses generated 65% of the new jobs in America over the past 17 years, according to the Small Business Administration. And such firms, defined as having fewer than 500 workers, employ half of all workers in the private sector. Both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have spoken about the importance of small businesses and their commitment to supporting them. But Walsh already understands the bigger issue: how to make sure a nascent business survives. ""Right now, I'm not making much money,"" Walsh sighed, her laptop perched on the antique writer's desk that used to belong to her grandfather, ""but I think once more people know who I am and actually see me out more, I think that could change."" Better off than four years ago? Watch Jannet Walsh's iReport . In addition to the normal steep hill involved with starting a business, this entrepreneur faces a hurdle with her location. Walsh moved back to the small town of Murdock, Minnesota, two years ago to help her mother, who was ill and died last fall. She has stayed in the farming community of 278 people for a number of reasons. Her aunt is ill and in a nearby nursing home, and after returning to Murdock, Walsh has had a renewed sense of family and easy-going community. ""There's not a lot of nightlife here,"" she admitted. Then the former newspaper worker paused, her face then lighting into a smile, ""but in the evening, when it gets cooler, you'll see people walking, and they'll walk through town or through the old cemetery. It's very nice."" Walsh pointed out the homes of relatives, friends and perhaps the town's most knowing resident, Mrs. Clark, whose house has a clear view of the church steps. Now, she hopes she can beat the odds and make a small business thrive in this quiet town. According to the SBA, a third of all small businesses shutter in the first two years, and half call it quits in the first five. This is what the men running for president say they want to change, and both men say they'd try to help by changing the tax code. Romney would like to cut all individual income taxes by 20%. But critics say the Republican's plan would result in higher tax rates for the smallest earners, like Walsh, and lower tax rates for some bigger companies. Romney vs. Obama on taxes . Obama has not made a specific proposal for individual income tax cuts but insists that he is for tax reform that would lower most rates. He has signed and proposed other specific tax help for small businesses, including a deduction on $125,000 worth of expenses. As with Romney's plan, critics point out that larger businesses could end up with lower tax rates than some small companies under the president's proposal. Embed America's behind-the-scenes video with Walsh . In Minnesota, Walsh's business, with just five paying clients, is about as small as they get. In part, that is because her starting strategy has included a few nonpaying events so that she could get more attention for her work and name.

How are you coping with the economy? Share your story with CNN iReport . Walsh has invested money in equipment and advertising for her new venture. But, like many people starting a small business, she is not counting on that as her only source of income. She's not sure the candidates understand the juggling act a startup requires.

We need to rethink how we earn our money to live, and it might have to be through several flows of income."" iReport Debate: Two unemployed voters talk jobs .

"Actor Dash Mihok first attracted Hollywood's attention in Baz Luhrmann's 1996 take of ""Romeo + Juliet."" Since then he's had roles in several major films -- ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" ""The Thin Red Line"" and the award-winning ""Silver Linings Playbook"" -- and a long list of television shows, including ""Felicity,"" ""Law & Order"" and ""The Good Wife."" Mihok currently stars on Showtime's ""Ray Donovan"" as Ray's brother Bunchy. It's an impressive career for anyone trying to break into show business, but Mihok makes it more impressive with his revelation: He was diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome at age 6. CNN spoke with Mihok in Lakeland, Florida, where he was speaking out against bullying at schools in connection with Jaylen's Challenge. The following is an excerpt of that interview: . CNN: What was it like for you, at 6 years old, when you first started experiencing symptoms of Tourette's? Dash Mihok: My first tic was to shake my head violently. I was in karate class, and I was shaking violently. All of a sudden, I just started to notice that the teacher was looking at me, and all the kids were wondering what I was doing. I suddenly felt really strange. It was the experience of knowing that you're doing something and that you have to do it. It's impossible to stop, and that's very unnerving, no matter what age you are. You're scared, you're interested, you're wondering: ""What is this that's happening to me?"" I think, as with anything that comes about health-wise, it's always going to be sort of scary and interesting at the same time. CNN: Did you ever experience any violent tics, where you hurt yourself of someone around you? Mihok: I've have a number of violent tics. With Tourette syndrome, there's not just compulsive actions, but compulsive thoughts as well. That used to scare my mother a lot. I've done everything from having to slap my butt or kick my own face. You know, I had this tic where I touch my mouth to my knee, and I'm always screwing up my back. I've had two shoulder surgeries. My doctor just smiles and laughs at me. I probably am going to need another one, because when they do the surgery, they say the one thing you can't do is this (reaches arm behind back to touch the top of his back). That's one of my biggest tics. CNN: As you started auditioning for bigger and bigger roles, did you try to hide your Tourette's from the casting directors and producers? Mihok: It's funny you should ask that question. When I auditioned when I was younger, I definitely hid it. In fact, I hid it from the Hollywood world as much as I could until, probably, my mid-20s. I'm not sure if that was a conscious effort, but it was just what I did growing up. It was better for me to cope that way. I'd just keep it bottled up, then go somewhere else and have an outburst. Auditioning is one of the most nerve-racking things you could ever do, but you have to be so focused that you don't tic. CNN: Watching you act, it's almost impossible to pick up on any of your ""tic-ing."" How are you able to keep it under wraps while filming your scenes? Mihok: This is a very old debate, and I don't think it should be a debate, but it is. People believe that if you can shut your Tourette's off for a period of time, then you can always shut it off. I try to explain to people that if I spent my whole life trying to control my tics, that's all I would have time for. If I can just accept it, and tic when I want to and have my passion project -- what I'm mentally, physically, emotionally invested in something -- where you're fully focused and your body ports and mind are all moving toward this one goal, you're focused and you can shut it off, but only for a certain period of time. Then, you have to let loose. I think that's what it's like for most people, who let loose in other ways, doing different things. But to the skeptics, I would say, ""I just wish you could walk in my shoes, just for an hour, to know what it feels like to have the greatest itch you've ever had and multiply that by a thousand. There's no way you can't scratch it. It's impossible. You have to do it."" Some people, unfortunately, don't believe that, and to them I would say, ""Step into my shoes for a day.""

Mihok: You know, when we do these presentations, there are some kids that probably tune it out, but you can also see there are a bunch of kids who really get it. When I see that one kid that really gets it, you see the light in their eye -- they identify with Jaylen. At one point in their life, they have either been the bully or been bullied. They look at themselves in the mirror and they're at an age where they're starting to learn about their own consciousness. If just one kid leaves with that much more confidence, willing to talk to one more person, willing to take that shot to stop a bully in his or her tracks.

"The West African country of Senegal has confirmed its first Ebola case one week after closing its border with Guinea over fears that the deadly outbreak could spread, the Senegalese Press Agency reported Friday. Senegal is the fifth country in the region where the virus has spread. Senegal's health minister, Awa Marie Coll Seck, confirmed that a 21-year-old university student from Guinea was infected with the Ebola virus and placed in quarantine in the Fann Hospital in Dakar, the news agency reported. Officials in Guinea alerted Senegal on Wednesday after losing track of the young man, the agency reported. The man, who doesn't have any signs of bleeding, went to the hospital for a checkup, the agency said. His condition is stable. On August 21, Senegal closed its border with Guinea over fears of the Ebola outbreak, the deadliest ever. The closure includes any aircraft and ships traveling to Senegal from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia. The Ebola outbreak ""continues to accelerate"" in West Africa and has killed 1,552 people, the World Health Organization said Thursday. The total number of cases stands at 3,069, with 40% occurring in the past three weeks. ""However, most cases are concentrated in only a few localities,"" the WHO said. The outbreak has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with a handful of cases in Nigeria. The overall fatality rate is 52%, the WHO said, ranging from 42% in Sierra Leone to 66% in Guinea. The case of the Conakry University student is the first one reported in Senegal, which is northwest of Guinea. Sierra Leone and Liberia border Guinea to the southwest. Those three nations have been the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. Corpses in the three countries are being buried without determining a cause of death, the WHO says. Medical staff cannot keep up with current health demands, especially with the limited supplies they have on hand. Senegal is not the first country to close its border during the outbreak. President Ellen Sirleaf has shut most of Liberia's borders to contain the virus. The few points of entry that are still open are testing people passing through for Ebola. Guinea and Sierra Leone have done the same. Kenya, South Africa and others in the region are also limiting travel to and from the area. On Friday, the WHO urged countries to avoid actions that compromise Ebola response efforts, such as closing borders and entry points or banning flights. The measures isolate and stigmatize the affected countries, making it difficult to transport supplies, the organization said via Twitter. The crisis has taken a heavy toll on health workers caring for those struck down by the virus. The WHO said Monday that 120 health care workers have died in the Ebola outbreak, and twice that number have been infected.","Senegal in West Africa confirms its first Ebola case a week after closing its borders .

"It's easy to write off Bolivia's largest city as just another congested, chaotic Latin American metropolis. As more international travelers discover Bolivia for its biodiversity, where they can explore the Andes, the Amazon basin and the world's largest salt lake in one visit, La Paz is their most likely point of entry. But to most, it's little more than that -- a place to spend a day or two sipping coca tea and adjust to life at 10,000 feet while planning adventures. The congestion and chaos quickly become apparent as you descend the Altiplano to the ""bowl"" of the downtown core, a tangled maze of steep and winding streets. The cultural legacy of Bolivia's largest indigenous groups, the Quechua and Aymara, permeate the busy urban landscape, where vehicles compete with pedestrians and sidewalk vendors. With elevations ranging from 9,800 to 13,450 feet, ""the city that touches the sky"" has plenty of distinctions that come in handy in bar trivia: home of the world's highest international airport and highest seat of government. Its elevation also makes for extreme temperature: sunny, hot days and cold, windy nights. But a closer look reveals some unexpected surprises that aren't spelled out in tour guides. Plaza San Francisco . Flanked by the Iglesia de San Francisco, a noisy thoroughfare and a busy side street, Plaza San Francisco is not the prettiest public space La Paz has to offer, but it's a great place to people-watch. Women dressed in traditional indigenous style of bowler hats and poofy petticoats, babies slung over their shoulders in colorful wraps, wait for buses alongside teens in skinny jeans and heavy eye makeup. Vendors in blue jumpsuits push around carts of ice cream which everyone seems to be eating. The San Francisco church is worth a visit in itself. Its stone-carved facade is in the intricate style of 16-century baroque and mestizo architecture. A tour of the basilica and cloister offers an overview of La Paz's founding and fight for independence, along with an opportunity to glimpse the city from the bell tower. Calle Jaen . The city's last remaining example of what a street looked like in colonial times could be considered one of the most touristy parts of La Paz, owing to the polish of its refurbished structures. But in a busy metropolis that doesn't go out of its way to cater to tourists, it's a peaceful stretch of cobblestone and colorful buildings that brings to mind other colonial cities like Antigua, Guatemala, or Campeche, Mexico. Step inside one of the dimly-lit bars or restaurants and you'll find quiet courtyards shielded from the bustle of the city. The street is home to four museums in colonial homes, noteworthy for their architecture as much as their exhibits. Museo de Casa Murillo -- former home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, one of the martyrs of the La Paz Independence movement of July 16, 1809 -- features paintings, furniture and clothing from an era when La Paz was torn between loyalty to the Spanish viceroy and support for indigenous rights. At the Museo de Instrumentos Musicales, also a school and meeting place for aspiring musicians, visitors are likely to stumble upon a jam session of charango players or pan flutists. Students of the school often put on Saturday night performances, where you might catch a guitar duet performed by a 7-year-old prodigy and his Japanese instructor. Museo Nacional de Etnografia y Folklore . If you're in Bolivia long enough, chances are you'll stumble on a parade or celebration where traditional Bolivian song and dance is the centerpiece (yet another reason to stick around La Paz on the weekend). The colorful costumes and masks, representative of dances from different regions and evocative of the film, ""Return to Oz,"" might leave the uninitiated wondering what the heck is going on. The Museo Nacional de Etnografia y Folklore offers some explanation for why horned devil masks and caricatures of African slaves figure prominently in folklore in an impressive display of masks and costumes. For extra trivia, check out the exhibit on the participation of transvestites in cultural celebrations of the late 20th century. Most Wednesdays, the museum keeps its doors open late for a show by the renowned Ballet Folklórico de La Paz, in which dancers decked out in full garb demonstrate customs from various regions, minus the drunken revelry of the street. Local markets, Witches Market, Calles Sagarnaga and Linares . Most Western tourists will have little use for items at local markets. But they're good for getting a sense of how Bolivians shop and what seems to be popular: puffy corn resembling Styrofoam, exotic seeds, reams of multi-colored fabric, shoes and underwear, cell phone chips, kitchen accessories, a shoe shine, keys made by hand. Those who've never seen a dried llama or alpaca fetus would do well to check out Witches Market, which also offers charms and herbs that purport to prolong sexual encounters or attract secret crushes. Vendors down the street on Calle Linares down to Sagarnaga sell the traditional goods that tourists tend to look for in South America -- colorful hats and scarves made of alpaca and llama wool bearing images of alpacas and llamas, colorful rugs and textiles, jewelry with indigenous designs, all cheaper than you'll find similar items in Peru or Chile. Street food . At the local markets, tucked among the stalls of clothes and housekeeping products, foreigners can eat like a local at the same prices as a local, $1 to $2 on average. Eating in the street is not for everyone, especially those with sensitive stomachs, but it's worth for the risk for those willing to try. Bolivia is a meat and potatoes kind of country, with a knack for throwing fried eggs on the side and a few pieces of yucca if you're lucky. Women push around carts that double as kitchen counters from which they prepare full course meals, from lechon to empanadas to roasted pork sandwiches. At night, more roving carts appear, offering tripe or hamburgers and hot dogs and salchipapas (sausages and french fries). Fresh fruit juice stands are abundant, but should also be approached with caution. Cups of pear juice with a fuzzy pit resting at the bottom may remind you of the llama fetus at Witches Market, but drink it and you'll be treated to one of the sweetest drinks without artificial sweetener you'll ever try. Don't forget to suck on the pit when you're done!","Travelers visiting Bolivia often overlook city of La Paz .

"Not so long ago, Costa Rica was a backpacker's game. Other than a few business-class hotels in the capital of San José and a handful of isolated luxury properties scattered about the scenic hinterlands, travelers could expect little in the way of genuine comfort while exploring one of the most beautiful and eco-conscious countries on the planet. Over the past decade, however, Costa Rica's fastest-growing crop has been a collection of opulent hotels and resort communities, complemented by marinas, golf courses, gourmet restaurants, hot springs and other world-class facilities. The tag attached to most deluxe properties is usually something like ""ecolodge"" or ""ecoresort,"" which may conjure visions of dreadlocks, granola and recycled hemp-fiber sheets. Don't be fooled. Yes, most of the country's destinations are green; Costa Rica's Sustainable Tourism Program rewards environmentally friendly properties with one to five ""leaves"" and copious free publicity. But Costa Rica's new upscale properties are as elegant and comfortable as any in Latin America. Here are the best regions and stays for putting a little service and Chardonnay into your sand and scenery. Gulf of Papagayo . Costa Rica's posh spot is Papagayo, a sparkling strand of beaches in the northwestern Guanacaste Province. Once better known for sabaneros (cowboys) and fine horses, Papagayo Peninsula has been developed into Central America's premier luxury destination. It even has its own international airport (LIR) just minutes away in the regional capital of Liberia. Lavish rental properties, excellent restaurants and bellowing howler monkeys might convince you to stay put for your entire vacation. But it's worth leaving the luxury (and wildlife) to see some of the region's outstanding national parks and festive beach communities. Accommodations are led by the exquisite Four Seasons Papagayo, the top pick in a scenic region that boasts Costa Rica's best resorts, golf courses, spas and white-sand beaches. 5 reasons to visit Easter Island . Manuel Antonio . Rolling jungle hills surround tiny Manuel Antonio National Park, considered Costa Rica's most beautiful, as well as its original upscale destination. It's also one of the most wildlife-rich regions in the world, which means you're certain to spot several species of monkeys, sloths and tropical birds, among other animals. Excellent restaurants, sparkling nightlife, art galleries and an array of adventure tour operators make it a honeymooner's choice. When traveling in high season (December through February), make reservations well in advance, and be prepared for crowds. Among numerous upscale hotel choices, the prestigious Arenas Del Mar Beachfront & Rainforest Resort has received the Costa Rica Tourist Ministry's Five Sustainability Leaf Award along with its top Five Star Award for luxury and comfort. Within walking distance of the national park, the gorgeously landscaped property is an attraction in its own right. Arenal . Until 2011, Arenal Volcano was Costa Rica's most active volcano. Alas, for area entrepreneurs, the lava flows that graced so many tourism brochures have mellowed to mere puffs of smoke. On the upside, you can now get excellent deals on the region's dozen or so five-star properties, the best of which are known for their spectacular hot springs. The gold standard is Tabacón Grand Spa and Thermal Resort, with world-class rooms and restaurants, as well as a river of steaming natural water, which feeds extravagant gardens and spas. A close runner-up is the Springs. It features a dozen cascading pools and whimsically decorated rooms. No matter where you stay, virtually all area hotels will arrange day trips to the many hot springs pouring from Arenal's slopes, a must while you're in Costa Rica. Santa Teresa . On the tip of Nicoya Peninsula, the wide white-sand beaches of Santa Teresa have become a playground for celebrities, jet-setters and vanguard surfers. You'll need to take a ferry or small plane to the isolated spot (often voted Central America's most beautiful beach), where an array of luxury boutique hotels and condo rentals await. The fabulous oceanfront Florblanca and Latitude 10 are full-service resorts that won't disappoint. Tamarindo . Costa Rica's most famous beach town is growing up, its scruffy surf shacks and beach bars now complemented with excellent restaurants and attractive accommodations. Despite complaints that paving the roads and erecting high rises have compromised Tamarindo's authentic local flavor, the surfing is still awesome, and the neighboring beaches of Las Baulas National Marine Park, known for nesting sea turtles, have remained pristine. Tamarindo's top-end options are well-established, such as the sprawling The Westin Resort & Spa Playa Conchal and plush rental properties at Reserva Conchal. But there are other interesting options, including the romantic Los Altos de Eros, which gets high marks for its attentive staff, and the golf resort at nearby Hacienda Pinilla resort, which sits astride three miles of superb shoreline. The cloud forests . An escape from lowland heat and humidity, Costa Rica's mountains and volcanoes are topped with misty cloud forests, where temperatures hover between 12 and 20 C (53 to 68 F) year-round and visitors will find a number of outstanding mountain lodges. Some travelers may want to skip Monteverde, Costa Rica's most famous cloud forest (aka ""crowd forest""). Lodges such as Villa Blanca Cloud Forest Hotel and El Silencio Lodge and Spa offer access to quieter, private wildlife reserves. Others such as Finca Rosa Blanca and Xandari Alajuela are located on coffee plantations and have beautiful trails good for wildlife viewing. The imaginative Peace Lodge, La Paz Waterfall Gardens is a unique spot with lots of wildlife to watch from gorgeous jungle positions. Los Sueños . An hour from San José and the country's international airport, Los Sueños Resort and Marina is Costa Rica's best value for luxury digs. Anchored by the graceful Los Sueños Marriott, surrounded by scores of extravagant rental properties, an adorable marina area and one of the country's best golf courses, Los Sueños offers almost everything you'd want from a tropical vacation, albeit without the hassle of actually seeing Costa Rica. By ""almost everything,"" it's worth mentioning that there's no real beach, hence the spectacular collection of swimming pools. 7 luxury vacations in Mexico .","Costa Rica's luxury offerings are among the best in Latin America .

"(CNN) -- Some voters are still pining for Mitt Romney to pick a dream running mate who's likely out of reach -- a candidate who has said she won't run. ""Gov. Romney, if you're watching, please pick Condoleezza Rice,"" said Geoffrey Phillips, a Romney supporter in Cotati, California. ""She's going to help you with your expertise and foreign affairs, and she has all the experience you're looking for. I think she will help swing the election your way when it comes time. I think she'll add that excitement that your campaign needs."" CNN asked iReporters across the political spectrum to weigh in on who would best fill out Romney's ticket. Among the dozens of responses, Rice, the former secretary of state under George W. Bush, was the most popular pick. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty were among other popular choices. Rating Romney's possible running mates . Rice, who some see as a Republican Hillary Clinton, has made it pretty clear she's not interested in the job of vice president: . ""I cannot imagine myself running for office,"" she told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" in January. ""Not because politics are so tough, but it's just not me."" Rice reiterated on CBS News last month, ""There is no way that I will do this because it's really not me. Gov. Romney needs to find someone who wants to run with him. There are many people who will do it very, very well."" Still, voters seem to be calling out her name as they wait for Romney's expected VP announcement. ""She's so experienced in the government, she's extremely intelligent, she's a woman and she's African-American,"" said iReporter Kathi Cordsen from Fullerton, California. ""All of these qualities could help Romney beat Obama, and to me, that's the main goal."" A Romney-Rice ticket would restore ""hope to America,"" said Vernon Hill of Morehead City, North Carolina. ""Romney and Rice would bring back prosperity, enthusiasm and complement each other in bringing America back to the great country we once were,"" Hill said. ""Rice is not a career politician; she left Washington when her time was up and never, ever looked back. This makes a statement to the character of this lady."" Sam Otto, 16, concedes that Rice would complement Romney on foreign affairs but said, ""If that's the point, you can just reappoint her as secretary of state. That's what secretary of state is for."" The teen from Johnson Creek, Wisconsin, said he thinks his home state can offer the perfect running mate for Romney. ""I'd pick Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan,"" he said, ""because he's a safe, yet daring pick and is young but is still experienced, so he could, from on Day One, step into the presidency."" Otto said that despite Ryan being in his early 40s, he has a lot of experience, as he has been in the House of Representatives since 1999. Add in that Ryan is from Wisconsin and that he could appeal to both tea party and establishment GOP figures, Otto said. Speaking of certain states being key, Ohio is another one that may be important for Romney. Arthur Oliva, a college student in Oxford, Ohio, argues that Portman is the man for the job. ""Whoever wins Ohio can pretty much guarantee the presidency,"" he said. ""Portman is a pretty popular senator in the state. He won his last election by a landslide, and he still remains pretty popular, especially in his home county of Hamilton."" Oliva supports President Barack Obama but said Romney should also pick Portman because ""he is a proven attack dog, and he has foreign policy credentials."" Some said they thought loyalty to Romney should play a larger role than credentials in his selection. The smartest choice would be former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, according to left-leaning independent Matt Sky. ""You have a guy with executive experience, he has some foreign policy experience, he's been incredibly loyal to the Romney campaign,"" said the free-lancer from New York. ""He's not super exciting, but he's not going to overshadow the candidate either."" Adding excitement to Romney's campaign was a common refrain sung by most iReporters, but there was disagreement as to which candidate would bring forth the energy. Rubio would be up to the challenge, but he could also be ""a true jewel to the Romney campaign,"" said Nicholas Pegues. ""I believe he would excite young people to vote Republican more, and Sen. Rubio would bring a great wealth of knowledge to the Romney campaign for cultural diversity,"" the Memphis, Tennessee, native said. ""He'll just be a great access for minorities in the Republican Party."" Rick Huffman said he would also like Rubio to run alongside Romney, mostly because the senator holds strong conservative values. ""I think Rubio is very articulate, intelligent, great personality, charismatic and most of all, very conservative,"" said the St. Joseph, Michigan, resident. ""He will make Joe Biden look like a dunce in debates.""","CNN asked iReporters to weigh in on who they think would make the best GOP VP pick .

"An American who said he crossed illegally into North Korea gave an unusual press conference in the country on Sunday, where he denounced the U.S. political and economic systems. The man identified himself as 29-year-old Arturo Pierre Martinez, a U.S. citizen born and raised in El Paso, Texas. ""I have taken up a risky journey to the DPRK so that I can pass on some very valuable and disturbing information I felt that its government would appreciate,"" Martinez said. ""I've chosen the Democratic People's Republic of Korea only due to its mostly socialistic way and due to its very powerful military,"" he added. ""It's continued to defy Americans and pluralistic power and influence throughout its history."" After his stay in North Korea, Martinez said, he plans to seek asylum in Venezuela. Not the first try . Martinez's mother, Patricia Eugenia Martinez of El Paso, said her son suffers from bipolar disorder and has previously tried to enter North Korea by swimming across a river. But he was stopped and sent back to the United States, where he was placed in a California psychiatric hospital. ""Then he got out,"" she told CNN. ""He is very smart, and he got the court to let him out, and instead of coming home to us he bought a ticket and left for China. He took out a payday loan online and left for China."" Martinez's mother also described him as altruistic. ""He said he wanted to protect Latinos, and he worried about the world and about people,"" she said. ""He loves to read and write and work on the computer. He loved to help poor people. He is our only child."" She said the U.S. Embassy in Beijing has been looking for him. Spate of complaints . In his 4,000-word statement, Martinez criticized American politicians and police as well as the electoral and prison systems. ""The illegal war carried out against the nation of Iraq serves as a perfect example of how the U.S. government acts much like a Mafia enterprise ... criminally plundering entire nations of their resources, strategic reserves and economies,"" he said. He said the electoral system in the United States ""is unfairly built for the benefit of the wealthy through the necessity of costly fundraising for political candidates seeking office. The democracy of this nation is an illusion, and its representatives act as nothing more than power brokers for those who can offer them."" Of superwealthy Americans, he said, ""These billionaires in power are nothing short of sociopathic megalomaniacs on the path to absolute world domination."" He also talked about unidentified flying objects, the CIA's alleged involvement in the cocaine trade, ""ultrasonic"" devices that cause people to hear voices and experience bodily discomfort, and how the Western news media have unfairly portrayed North Korea. Fate unclear . Martinez said he committed a crime by illegally entering the country but said he was ""extremely grateful for having been pardoned from the punishments given to violators of these laws, and for the most generous reception I have received."" He delivered his statement at a press conference that he said he requested. North Korea released images showing him wearing a suit and sitting in a room facing a large group of people. Martinez said he first tried to cross over from South Korea's Han River and tried again from China's Yalu River in Dandong. After speaking with CNN, Patricia Martinez released a statement saying she is ""glad and relieved that my son is safe."" ""I am appreciative to the North Korean authorities for pardoning my son and releasing him,"" she said. ""I look forward to spending Christmas with him after they release him."" When asked how she knew her son was being released, she said it was from reading the press conference statement. But the legal status of Martinez in North Korea is unclear, and it's not known whether he's free to leave the country. North Korea said Martinez entered the country in November, two days after American envoy James Clapper arrived. Clapper negotiated the release of Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller, the last two American citizens known to be held by North Korea. They arrived back in the United States on November 8. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Sunday that department officials ""stand ready to provide all possible consular assistance."" ""The welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad is one of our top priorities,"" Harf said.","The man identifies himself as 29-year-old Arturo Pierre Martinez of El Paso, Texas .

"Guantanamo Bay detainees have long been considered America's most dangerous enemies. So what happens when they walk free -- like the five detainees swapped for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl? Do they return to terror activities or transition to quiet, private lives away from the mayhem? Well, it's a mixture of both. How dangerous is this latest swap? Mathematically, it's not an even swap. But President Barack Obama's administration maintains it's not a risky move for the United States. The five detainees have been at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba for years, and out of commission for a long time. They probably don't have extensive networks to tap into, according to two senior U.S. officials. Additionally, there will be fewer U.S. forces to target in Afghanistan since under a new agreement, most troops will be out of the nation next year. Qatar has also reassured the United States that it will aggressively monitor the detainees, who will be under a travel ban for one year. How many freed detainees have returned to terrorism? At its peak, Guantanamo Bay had 770 men believed by the U.S. government to be involved in terrorist activity or military attacks. That number has dwindled significantly. As of last month, the facility had 154 detainees. A September 2013 report from the director of national intelligence reflected on what happened to the roughly 600 people who left Gitmo between its opening in 2002 and July 2013. Of those, 100 -- or 16.6% of the released prisoners -- were ""confirmed"" to have returned ""to terrorist activities."" Seventeen of those died, while 27 ended up in custody, according to the DNI report. An additional 70 are ""suspected of reengaging,"" it said. ""Based on trends identified during the past 10 years, we assess that if additional detainees are transferred without conditions ... some will reengage in terrorist or insurgent activities,"" the report said. Does the  U.S. keep an eye on freed detainees? While the former prisoners are no longer under its control, Washington says it keeps track of them, which is the basis of the DNI report. During President George W. Bush's administration, some were handed over to authorities in other countries. Dozens more were released under Obama. Are American interests more at risk when they get out? There are a lot of variables, making this a debatable question. Except for those accused or convicted of the most heinous crimes such as murder, most people are not detained indefinitely. And studies show the recidivism rate for those in the U.S. legal system typically top 50% or even 60%, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Armed with that knowledge, the idea of a Gitmo detainee returning to his previous ways may not be surprising. It also depends on where they go from there. The DNI report notes the dangers of transferring prisoners to nations with conflicts, instability and active recruitment by terror groups. In other words, a detainee who returns to a place beset by violence -- where terrorist  groups and attacks are common -- is more likely to return to the fold. Does this mean the U.S. got a raw deal in Bergdahl's release? Depends on whom you ask. Sen. John McCain, a former prisoner of war, is not popping the Champagne  just yet. He knows a thing or two about life in enemy hands after spending more than five years in captivity in North Vietnam. Since then, he has emerged as one of the nation's loudest, boldest voices on military matters. And he feels strongly that the United States did not think this through. ""Don't trade one person for five (of) the hardest of the hard-core, murdering war criminals who will clearly re-enter the fight and send them to Qatar, of all places,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night. But White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice defended the Obama administration's decision. The ""acute urgency"" of Bergdahl's health condition justified the President not notifying Congress beforehand that he was  being swapped for the five detainees, she said. Why are terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay? The U.S. naval base there was transformed after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Existing migrant detention facilities were revamped to house detainees of the so-called war on terror. These were men, who though captured in the battlefield, didn't fit any detention category. U.S. authorities said they didn't have the same rights as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions. Nor did they have the same rights as those detained within the United States. The Bush administration argued that since the detainees were not on U.S. soil, they were not covered by the U.S. Constitution. It used that rationale to justify  the lack of legal protections for those detained. That made the base sometimes referred to as Gitmo a sort of no man's land. How much does it cost to keep it running? It costs the Defense Department about $150 million a year to keep the facility in operation. The U.S. pays Cuba about $4,085 a year for the lease, but the latter hasn't accepted payment since 1959. Shortly after his inauguration in 2009, Obama signed an executive order to close the detention facility within one year. It has not happened. Has everyone at Gitmo been found guilty of terrorism? No. Peter Bergen, a CNN national security analyst, and Bailey Cahall, a research associate at the New America Foundation, wrote in an op-ed last year that said dozens of detainees cleared for release years ago ""remain in seemingly perpetual custody."" ""They have found to be guilty of nothing, yet they are being held indefinitely,"" Bergen and Cahall wrote. ""Indefinite detention without charge is a policy that we usually associate with dictatorships, not democracies."" Bergen also heads the New America Foundation's International Security Program. Others, though, view the situation differently. They say terrorists don't play by any recognized rules of warfare or justice; their mission is to kill, with U.S. forces and citizens as their targets. McCain says that the five men released as part of the Bergdahl deal could be among those attacking U.S. citizens both at home and overseas. The five ""were judged time after time as unworthy ... that needed to be kept in detention because they posed a risk and a threat to the United States of America,"" the Arizona Republican said. Who were the detainees swapped for Bergdahl? Two senior Obama administration officials identified them as Khair Ulla Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori, Abdul Haq Wasiq and Mohammad Nabi Omari. They were mostly mid- to high-level officials in the Taliban regime who were detained early in the war in Afghanistan because of their positions within the Taliban, not because of ties to al Qaeda. But some such as  Khairkhwa  are alleged to have been ""directly associated"" with Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda's now-deceased leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.","About 17% of Gitmo detainees return to terrorist activities, report says .

"Walking around the main cemetery in Culiacan, Mexico, is like being in Disneyland for the dead. Known as Jardines del Humaya, the cemetery holds huge mausoleums made of 30-foot-high marble columns. Many of the grave sites are enclosed by ornate buildings the size of small houses. These mausoleums have sitting rooms where family members come to remember their loved ones in true fiesta fashion. Fresh flowers surround altars of expensive bottles of scotch and tequila. Many tombs are air-conditioned, and some even have surround-sound piping in the favorite ballads of the deceased. But the most surreal part of the cemetery is not what's above ground -- it's the age of the victims buried below. Many of the ""residents"" of these extravagant tombs are teenagers, and many seem to be just shy of their 25th birthday. Culiacan is the birthplace (and for many, the resting place) and base of the Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful drug trafficking organizations. Bloody battles between cartels and rivals have filled Jardines del Humaya with some of Mexico's most infamous narco-traffickers. The opulence of their graves is a tribute to the lifestyle of El Narco and the billions of dollars coming into Sinaloa state from the lucrative trade. Like modern-day pharaohs, these drug lords continue to bathe in excess even in the afterlife. In stark contrast to the McMausoleums of Jardines del Humaya, an unimpressive headstone sits in a small cemetery a few miles away. It is the grave of Oscar Rivera, a government spokesman, who had worked as a journalist for many years in Culiacan and covered some of the violence and corruption that engulfed the city. Rivera's reporting, which touched on how the influence of narco-trafficking permeated every aspect of Culiacan life, contained none of the glamour or rewards of the narco trade itself. Rivera drove a dilapidated car, in contrast to the legions of new Hummers that were cruising downtown Culiacan. He didn't have the fancy clothes or jewelry, and the tools of his trade were plastic pens, while the narcos carried bedazzled gold-plated AK-47s. Both in lifestyle and death-style, Rivera lacks any of the glitter of his narco subjects, but there is one great commonality between them: the peril of their professions. Since President Felipe Calderon took office in 2006 and declared an open war on the drug cartels, nearly 50,000 people have been killed in suspected drug-related violence in Mexico, according to Mexico's government. Many of the dead are narco-traffickers and low-level dealers. Increasingly, civilians have been caught in the crossfire as cartels fight for the lucrative drug trading zones so critical to smuggling narcotics north. The violence in towns along the U.S.-Mexico border has been well documented. What is lesser known is the violence against journalists. Targeted kidnappings, assassinations and threats have become the new normal for reporters who dare to cover drug trafficking and government corruption. Since 2000, more than 60 journalists have been killed in Mexico. Not included in that figure are dozens more who have been kidnapped or have simply disappeared. This has made Mexico one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists, and the trend is increasing. The impunity rate -- the rate at which those crimes go unsolved -- is 98%, according to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission.  In Mexico, when it comes to a reporter's death, it seems that many are literally getting away with murder. Javier Valdez Cardenas is a journalist in Culiacan who knew Rivera before Rivera was killed by more than 30 high-caliber bullets in 2007. Cardenas said that when a journalist like Rivera is killed, ""nothing happens. That's the saddest part, nothing happens. Living in Sinaloa is a threat, being a journalist is an additional threat."" Michael O'Connor, Mexico representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists, says that almost none of the murder cases of journalists are prosecuted. ""It's effective impunity, right. You just kill them and get away with it, and you solve your problems very easily,"" he said. ""And what does it cost to kill a journalist? Is it 500 bucks or is it 300 bucks, or is it two beers and the promise of promotion within the criminal organization? It's nothing. So if a journalist is causing you the slightest bit of problem, just get rid of them."" The threat to individual journalists has had larger consequences for the free media in Mexico. Many organizations have simply abdicated reporting on the drug wars altogether. Entire shootouts in broad daylight and murders go unreported. The frustration that newspapers experience has prompted an outcry. In 2010, El Diario, the most popular newspaper in Ciudad Juarez, published an unprecedented full-page editorial. ""You are, at present, the de facto authorities in this city,"" the newspaper's letter to the cartels said, ""because the legal institutions have not been able to keep our colleagues from dying. We do not want more deaths. We do not want more injuries or even more intimidation. It is impossible to exercise our role in these conditions. Tell us, then, what do you expect of us as a medium?"" The response by many newspapers and TV stations has been to simply stop reporting on narco violence and corruption altogether. The vulnerability of traditional media has left a void that some social media have stepped up to fill.  In Monterrey, Mexico, a Twitter feed warns people of attacks in real time. In Ciudad Juarez, El Blog De Narco has picked up covering the violence that the mainstream media has left off. But even these alternative outlets have been targeted by the cartels. Last year, a prominent blogger named Maria Elizabeth Macias, who published under the pseudonym ""La Nena de Nuevo Laredo,"" was found decapitated, with her head placed next to a keyboard. A note near the body, allegedly from members of the notorious Los Zetas cartel, read, ""OK Nuevo Laredo live on the social networks, I am La Nena de Laredo and I am here because of my reports and yours."" Two other bodies were found hanging from a bridge, disemboweled, with an ominous letter addressed to El Blog de Narco. The violence against journalists in Mexico has severely compromised the quality of information available to the public, both in Mexico and the rest of the world. Much of the international media reporting on the drug violence relies on local reporters. The media as a check on corruption, as a documentarian of daily life and as a purveyor of truth has been cowered. Despite the incredible dangers of reporting, a few courageous people have continued to cover the violence and corruption. In 2011, the Committee to Protect Journalists awarded Javier Valdez Cardenas the International Press Freedom Award for his reporting in Culiacan. When asked why he continues to write despite a grenade attack on his office, colleagues he has had to bury and repeated threats, he responded, ""In my opinion, silence is a form of death, of complicity. I am not dead, I'm alive, I'm writing these stories. I don't want the day to come where my children will be able to say, 'You were a journalist and this was happening in Culiacan and you stayed quiet.' No one will be able to tell me, 'You stayed quiet.' ""","Increasingly, civilians have been caught in the crossfire of Mexico's cartel violence .
