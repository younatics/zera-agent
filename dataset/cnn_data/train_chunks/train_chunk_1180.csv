"Women today may feel they have come a long way since the inequality of the Fifties, Sixties and Seventies. But the shelves of many toy shops paint a very different story. Where once toys may have been marketed in neutral colours to target both boys and girls, now they are much more likely to be gender stereotyped - blue for boys and pink for girls. The issue has been highlighted by campaign group Let Toys Be Toys, who recently shared a picture comparing the toys on sale in Argos in the Seventies to today on their Twitter feed. Avalanche of pink: A comparison by campaign group Let Toys Be Toys shows how in the Seventies, left, toys were in a variety of colours while today girls are pushed to embrace one shade . While decades ago toy pushchairs, prams and household equipment like play ovens came in whites, reds and blues - aimed at both genders - today the majority are all pink. And while the items above aimed at girls relate to being domesticated, in contrast boys today are encouraged to play with science sets, cars and action heroes. Let Toys Be Toys, set up by a group of British parents last November, are calling for this to change. They are petitioning retailers to stop segregating their products 'for boys' and 'for girls'. One of the campaign's founders, Tricia . Lowther, 44, a self-employed copywriter from Durham, who has a five-year-old daughter, told the . MailOnline: 'It does bother a lot of parents, we seem to have tapped in . to a huge and growing sense of frustration with the way toys are . promoted according to outdated, illogical and sexist stereotypes. 'I . can’t speak for any of the others but what pushed me to make a stand was . the realisation, after my daughter was born, that gender stereotyping . in children’s products had become worse than when I was a child myself . back in the Seventies. It’s something that has become almost impossible . to escape and is very limiting for children.' Shelves of a typical toy shop show the girl/boy divide: For the girls, it is all pink with Disney princess and Barbie promoted while the toys for boys to the right are blue and Star Wars themed . The Let Toys Be Toys petition, which has already . gained 6,000 signatures, states: 'In 2013 it is time to take down the . signs, labels and categories that tell parents, grandparents and . children that construction sets, adventure games, cars, science toys and . superheroes are 'toys for boys', and that baby dolls, play kitchens, . make-up sets, fashion, princesses and crafts are 'toys for girls'. 'Toys are for fun, for learning, for stoking imagination and encouraging creativity. Children should feel free to play with the toys that most interest them.' Research by Elizabeth Sweet, a doctoral candidate in sociology at the University of California, has backed up Tricia's belief that gender stereotyping of toys is getting worse. Writing in the New York Times last year, she said: 'We've made great strides toward gender equity over the past 50 years, but the world of toys looks a lot more like 1952 than 2012. 'During my research into the role of gender in Sears catalogue toy advertisements over the 20th century, I found that in 1975, very few toys were explicitly marketed according to gender, and nearly 70 percent showed no markings of gender whatsoever. 'In the 1970s, toy ads often defied gender stereotypes by showing girls building and playing airplane captain, and boys cooking in the kitchen. Boys are encouraged to play with mechanical toys and science kits while for girls it's all about dolls . 'But by 1995, the gendered advertising of toys had crept back to mid-century levels, and it’s even more extreme today. In fact, finding a toy that is not marketed either explicitly or subtly (through use of colour, for example) by gender has become incredibly difficult.' Let Toys Be Toys believe this kind of gender stereotyping from an early age can be damaging for children. They state: 'Whilst toys aimed at boys encourage activity and adventure, many girls’ toys send the message that appearance is what matters. It’s no surprise that the vast majority of adults with eating disorders are women.' Psychologist Steve Biddulph agrees. In his book, Raising Girls, he points to how little girls are are continually being bombarded with the message that it's their looks and being 'hot' that is the most important thing. While the media is to blame, he also points to the toy industry playing their part. He gives the example of a new range of 'Friends' Lego aimed at girls (predominantly pink of course) that focuses on being beautiful and marginalises female roles in society. Detrimental: Child psychologists agree the stereotyping of toys is encouraging girls to think it's only their appearance that matters . He said: 'Recently, the company (Lego) started producing five curvy plastic 'friends' who bake, home-make, decorate, style hair and shop. Plus a plastic female ghetto called Heartlake City, which somehow manages to thrive without any fire-fighters or policemen.' As well as toys aimed at girls being given a pink makeover since the Seventies, many children's favourite characters have also been glamorised - driving home the message that appearance, above all, counts. Disney faced a backlash from parents (and had to back down) after they recently tried to make Merida from Brave more sexy by giving her larger eyes, a smaller waist and frizz-free hair. But a look back at other characters - including Rainbow Bright and Strawberry Shortcake - shows how this has been going on for years. While once these female characters looked wholesome and innocent, now they're slimmer with longer legs and more make-up. Backlash: Disney had to back down after giving Brave character Merida a sexy makeover, right . Even animals don't escape a sexy make-over. The popular My Little Pony - which back in the Eighties did resemble the figure of a horse - has now been given long, slim legs, huge eyes complete with long false eyelashes and a long, wavy mane to rival the Duchess of Cambridge's. It isn't just girls who suffer from the gender segregation of toys. It also leaves boys unable to play with what they want due to what Ms Sweet calls 'a homophobic culture' of boys been mocked if they 'transgress into the 'pink' zone' and play with toys like dolls. Let Toys Be Toys believe by making and marketing toys in a more gender neutral way, children will truly have the freedom to develop. They state: 'This isn’t about political correctness. This is about doing the right thing by our children and giving them a real and varied choice. We believe in equality, but this isn’t about making children the same. It’s about giving children the choice to be individuals.' Rainbow Bright: In her modern day incarnation, right, the character is taller and slimmer with more make-up and slicker hair. While the Eighties version looks like a little girl, today she is more like a woman . Strawberry Shortcake: The modern day version, right, has a slimmer figure, longer hair, bigger eyes and a smaller nose .

"Serena Williams has sparked an intense backlash after she suggested the 16-year-old victim in the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case was asking to be assaulted. The world Number 1 tennis star  made the astonishing indictment in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, which was posted online on Tuesday. In the article, Williams said the victim 'shouldn't have put herself in that position' and described her as 'lucky.' Some are already labeling the 31-year-old's remarks the most controversial of her career. Apology: Serena Williams had sparked an intense backlash after she appeared to make an astonishing indictment of the victim in the Steubenville rape case . Outrage: Serena Williams, pictured on Tuesday at Burberry Menswear Spring/Summer 2014 fashion show in London, has sparked outrage with her controversial comments . 'Do you think it was fair, what they got? They did something stupid, but I don't know,' she told the magazine. 'I'm not blaming the girl, but if you're a 16-year-old and you're drunk . like that, your parents should teach you—don't take drinks from other . people.' 'She's 16, why was she that drunk where she doesn't remember? It could have been much worse. She's lucky. Obviously I don't know, maybe she wasn't a virgin, but she shouldn't have put herself in that position, unless they slipped her something, then that's different.' High school football players Trent Mays and Ma'Lik Richmond were each sentenced to a year in juvenile detention in March for raping the intoxicated teen. The two friends were caught after other students who watched the assault laughed and joked about the horrific crime in an online video. Williams' jaw-dropping remarks to Rolling Stone prompted a wave of criticism on Twitter on Tuesday. Shocking: Williams said the 16-year-old victim, pictured, 'shouldn't have put herself in that position' Sentenced: Trent Mays, left, and Ma'lik Richmond were sentenced to juvenile detention in March . One user, Jamil Smith, tweeted: 'Pro tip for @serenawilliams or others discussing rape: if ""I'm not blaming the girl, but…"" exits your mouth, stop there. There is no ""but.""' A female Titter user, Sabrina Siddiqui, wrote 'Disappointing that powerful woman like Serena Williams, who many young girls look up to, blames the victim.' Meanwhile, Kate R ‏tweeted: 'Seems Serena Williams needs a muzzle. Or compassion for a teenage rape victim? Either or...' and a user called JB wrote: 'Hopefully Serena Williams realises her mess & fixes it. So many women look up to her.' The tennis superstar, who recently won the French Open, put her foot in her mouth in the past. At the 2011 U.S. Open, she was fined for verbally abusing a lineswoman. More recently, the younger Williams sister had a verbal tit for tat with American tennis player Sloane Stephens after the up-and-coming player denied Williams was her mentor, adding that she had never reached out to her. In response, Williams tweeted 'I made you' to Stephens. She was also slammed for doing a Crip Walk synonymous with a dangerous gang in California after she won the Olympic gold in London.","Tennis Number 1 made the astonishing indictment of the 16-year-old victim in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine .

"As a fraudster is indicted for a $1.3million hoax counterfeiting rare wines and selling the bottles, attention has fallen to the consumer-trusted wine experts who were so easily fooled. The world's most respected taste buds bought, sold and wrote about Rudy Kurniawan's wine collection, many of which turned out to be re-marked fakes from Napa Valley. Now, as the 35-year-old faces jail time of up to 100 years, many are speculating as to how he managed to get away with it. Mr believable: Rudy Kurniawan conned savvy, competitive rare-wine collectors, with the biggest hoax in history taking place right under their noses . An article in the latest New York magazine points out how many of Mr Kurniawan's apparently sought-after wines, of which he sold more than $35 million worth in 2006 alone, are alleged to be counterfeits - potentially damaging the prestigious world of wine experts and their often snobby credibility. When the FBI arrested Mr Kurniawan on March 8, his Californian home contained explicit evidence of the scam, which alluded the circle of wine experts and enthusiasts who were his trusted confidants. Thousands of photocopied wine labels for top vintages, including 1950 Pétrus and 1947 Lafleur, Lafite, and Romanée-Conti were found next to hundreds of old and new corks, and an automatic device for inserting them. Most notably, there were bottles of cheap Napa Valley wine labelled with names of the vintage Bordeaux wines they allegedly intended to impersonate, and there were other bottles soaking in the kitchen sink, their labels about to be removed. Detailed instructions for fabricating labels for 1962 Domaine Ponsot Clos de la Roche were found as well as sealing wax and rubber stamps with vintages and chateaux names, such as 1899 and 1900 Latour. Fake labels: When the FBI arrested Mr Kurniawan, his Californian home contained explicit evidence of the scam, including thousands of photocopied wine labels . International wine auctioneers, such as John Kapon, expert Burgundy critics, like Allen Meadows, wine shop owner Paul Wasserman, as well as the wider wine industry, were all left to question how solid their old-wine knowledge really is. Along with Mr Wasserman, Mr Kapon had also published countless tasting notes based on Mr Kurniawan's wines, and Mr Meadows, too, had written notes for some of the rarest wines from Mr Kurniawan's apparent fake bottles. The inability to prove hard facts within the rare wine industry helped Mr Kurniawan carry out the biggest hoax in history right under their noses. Before World War II, there are few records showing how many bottles of a particular wine were produced, in what formats, and in what packaging, with variation in bottles being common. Also, the older and rarer the wine, the fewer people who have actually tasted it - and even skilled tasters can disagree about flavor. Explicit evidence: Bottles of cheap Napa Valley wine were found labelled with names of the vintage Bordeaux wines, along with their corks . Even if a wine tastes odd, it is usually cited as being 'inconsistent,' rather than declared a fake by auctioneers who do not want to risk losing consignments by investigating obscure bottles, or by winemakers who are uneasy about discussing counterfeiting, for fear of tainting their vineyard. In the rare-wine world, murkiness has the ability to turn doubt into mystique and many wealthy collectors only want to drink famous, expensive labels - not necessarily ask questions. It wasn't until Laurent Ponsot, the maker of a renowned collectible Burgundy, launched his own investigation after Mr Kurniwan tried selling fake versions of his wine, that the hoax started to unravel. Domaine Ponsot wines only started making its Clos St Denis in the Eighties,and it was an auction of Kurniawan-consigned vintages from 1959 and 1945 that alerted Mr Ponsot to the irrefutable fakes. The rare wine collecting industry is built upon scarcity, and the credibility and expertise of preeminent critics. Fraud: Detailed instructions for fabricating labels were found as well as sealing wax and rubber stamps with vintages and chateaux names . In reality, Mr Kurniawan's case may have proven the murky world of prestigious and rare wines is instead built on illusions, snobbery and ego. With so many experts duped, one could argue that expensive, vintage bottles may have a taste nearer to that of cheaper wines than the world has long lead to be believed. Mr Wasserman told the New York Times: 'It’s so damaging to the magic of wine.'","Rudy Kurniawan was indicted in New York last week .

"Change of opinion: James Lovelock once claimed that climate change would kill billions, but the environmentalist now says green movement theories are meaningless drivel . He was once a guru to  environmentalists, claiming climate change would kill billions of humans by the end of this century. But it seems James Lovelock has had a change of heart. On the eve of a major environmental summit, he has attacked the modern green movement – declaring its theories 'meaningless drivel'. Almost half a century after he revealed his Gaia theory, which inspired a generation of activists, the former Nasa scientists said he believed that rising sea levels were not a problem and that wind turbines were 'useless'. The 92-year-old described the modern green movement as a 'religion', which used guilt to gain support. Speaking about climate change, he said: 'I'm not worried about sea-level rises.' He added: 'At worst, I think it will be 2ft a century.' Slamming environmentalists, he said: 'It just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the Christian religion. 'I don't think people have noticed that, but it's got all the sort of terms that religions use. The greens use guilt. You can't win people round by saying they are guilty for putting CO2 in the air.' Mr Lovelock said he was a firm supporter of nuclear power and even voiced his support for fracking – the controversial process of extracting gas from rock deep underground, opposed by the green movement. He said: 'Gas is almost a giveaway in the US at the moment. They've gone for fracking in a big way. 'Let's be pragmatic and sensible and get Britain to switch everything to methane. We should be going mad on it.' In an interview, Mr Lovelock . described existing theories of 'sustainable development' – a key topic . for discussion at the upcoming summit – as 'drivel'. He . suggested that humans should instead use air conditioning to deal with . climate change in cities, citing Singapore as an example. He . said: 'If we all move into cities, they become the equivalent of a . nest. Then another thought comes immediately from that: if that's the . way the flow is going, don't stop it, let's encourage it. 'Instead of trying to save the planet by geo-engineering or whatever, you merely have to air-condition the cities.' Speaking . about Singapore he said:  'You could not have chosen a worse climate in . which to build a city. It's a swamp with temperatures in the 90s every . day, and very humid. Turnaround: Almost half a century after he revealed his Gaia theory, which inspired a generation of activists, the former Nasa scientists said he believed that rising sea levels were not a problem and that wind turbines were 'useless' 'But it is one of the most successful cities in the world. It's so much cheaper to air-condition the cities and let Gaia take care of the world. It's a much better route to go than so-called “sustainable development”, which is meaningless drivel. Mr Lovelock, who has conducted research at Yale and Harvard universities, has been a respected member of the academic community for decades. He discovered the presence of harmful chemicals – CFCs – in the atmosphere in the 1960s. He developed the Gaia theory while working with Nasa. It claims that the Earth has a  self-regulating system which has automatically controlled global temperature, atmospheric content, oxygen, ocean salinity, and other factors. But last month, the scientist admitted that he had been 'alarmist' and 'extrapolated too far' with his doomsday-like predictions on the effects of climate change. His latest comments came just a week before the Rio+20 summit, a major conference on climate change, to mark the anniversary of the landmark Earth Summit in 1992.

"Germ-ridden towels could be the worst culprits for spreading bugs around the home, researchers have warned. And its not just kitchen towels that are to blame - bath towels can also spread diseases. The problem is two fold: first, towels retain moisture for long periods of time, allowing the bacteria to survive. Secondly, they are used in the most germ-ridden areas of the house. Towels could be the most germ-riddled part of your home, experts have warned. This is because they retain moisture for long periods of time - allowing the bacteria to survive - and are used in the kitchen and bathroom . The recent study, from the University of Arizona, found coliform bacteria - bacteria present in faeces which can lead to outbreaks of food poisoning and diarrhoea - in 89 per cent of kitchen tea-towels and E. coli in 25.6 per cent of towels. The researchers said towels are more likely to be bacteria-ridden than other household items because they are used to wipe hand and surfaces that might have come into contact with raw meat products. Study author Charles Gerba said: 'You can cross contaminate food when you wipe your hands on a towel and then contaminate other foods or bring your hands to your mouth and infect yourself. 'With face and bath towels you may spread bacteria and viruses among family members who use the same towels,' he told ABC News. And bunging them in the washing machine might not be enough, either. The researchers warned of another study which found bacteria can survive washing and drying with detergent in the kitchen. Dr. Peter Barratt, of Initial Washroom Hygiene, told MailOnline: . 'The three elements required to provide a comfortable environment for bacteria and microfungi are: moisture, warmth and organic material. 'Obviously, towels get wet. They also often sit in warm, moist bathrooms and washrooms, and pick up dead skin particles during use, which provides the organic food material for microbes to live on. So, what's the best towel management strategy? Ideally, conventional cotton towels should never be used in communal situations, where bacteria and fungi can be transferred from one person to another. Washrooms should therefore consider more sanitary hand drying, like paper towels and hand dryers. In the home, gym etc, towels should be laundered regularly to remove contamination, and in between uses, should be dried effectively, as drying will temporarily arrest microbial growth. Damp, used towels in moist bathrooms WILL encourage microbial growth."" So what are the risks? Unlaundered, used, moist towels produce the highest risk of skin infections. For example, dermatophytic fungi, like those that cause athlete's foot, will not only live on the towel, but may cause skin infections in cut, abraded, or sensitive skin. It's skin infections that are the main risk, but if you can smell a mustiness around a towel, the chances are that it's bacteria and fungi that you can smell, and it's time for the washing machine.' ‘Coliforms, E. coli and Salmonella can survive the drying of kitchen cleaning cloths and regrow if the cloth becomes soiled again,’ researchers wrote in the study. They say soaking the cloths in bleach for two minutes was more effective in reducing numbers of bacteria than washing. Professor Anthony Hilton, head of biological and biomedical sciences at Aston University, warned washing towels at low temperatures does not always kill bacteria. He told MailOnline: ‘There’s a tendency towards people to use lower temps to wash fabrics, down to 30. If a child is unwell, and vomits on fabrics, they need to be washed at high temperatures. ‘Many of these organisms thrice at body temperature, they live at 37. So washing at 30 is not going to kill them. But there are laundry additives designed to enhance low temperature washing that will kill bacteria.’ Even regular bathroom towels need be used with care, he added. A recent study found coliform bacteria - bacteria present in faeces which can lead to outbreaks of food poisoning and diarrhoea - in 89 per cent of kitchen tea-towels . ‘When you rub a towel on your body or face, you leave a microbial fingerprint. ‘If it remains damp, such as after a shower, the organisms start to grow. That’s why towels start to grow musty. ‘In real terms of causing infection, there are lots of bacteria that aren’t harmful. 'But as an extreme, someone could wipe their backside and then those organisms would be on the towel, perhaps a child or someone with a diarrheal illness. ‘The towel would be used to wipe a face then you’ve got that faecal-oral link that leads to infection.' Infections such as athlete's foot are another issue, he said. Dr Lisa Ackerley, a leading hygiene expert from the University of Salford, told MailOnline: . 'The first thing is to keep towels separate. 'Put them on the towel rail to dry so they don't fester while they wait to be washed. 'Wash them often, at least once a week. 'Wash them on a high temperature, 90ºC wash - and bear in mind lots of washing machines don’t reach the temperatures they say they will. 'If you want to wash on a lower temperature, use a laundry cleanser product that kills bacteria. 'Bleach would kill bacteria on white towels . 'On face flannels, have one for each day and wash them all at the end of the week. 'Everybody should have their own bathroom towels, especially if they're ill.' And, to make them extra soft, replace fabric conditioner with vinegar. 'Anything with an exposure risk, especially in a damp environment, can spread infections. 'If I had athlete’s foot and rubbed my foot on someone else’s, they would expect to catch it. Putting a towel in between just wakes the towel the vehicle for exposure.’ And cross-contamination can be even worse in the kitchen, he explained. ‘In the kitchen environment you’ve got the dish cloth which lives in the sink in a bit of water used to dry up spills. Then you’ve got the tea towel used to dry dishes when they’re clean. ‘The problem comes when they are used for different purposes. 'The towels get used for wiping up footprints from a cat, or a shoe. 'You might end up washing up a spillage of raw chicken juices, and then next you might wipe some chocolate off a baby’s face with the same towel. ‘It’s probably full of nutrients, its damp, so bacteria will thrive. ‘These bacteria cause diarrhoeal disease, gastroenteritis.’","Main problem is that towels retain moisture, allowing bacteria to breed .

"The director of a video which showed a young woman being catcalled more than 100 times as she walked through the streets of Manhattan for ten hours has come under fire for the seeming racial bias of his film. Director Rob Bliss filmed actress Shoshana Roberts, 24, as she walked through busy, New York City streets, wearing jeans and a T-shirt, while enduring a barrage of comments like: 'What's up, Beautiful?'; 'Smile!' and 'God bless you, Mami...'. At one point, a man walks in step with her, silently, for five minutes. The majority of men featured in the two-minute clip are black and Latino, a fact which Mr Bliss addressed on Thursday during a Q&A session on Reddit after the video garnered reams of media coverage. Scroll down for video . Unwanted attention: Shoshana Roberts, 24, who appeared in the video showing the cat-calling she experienced over a ten-hour period, has since been subject to rape threats online . Hidden camera: The footage was captured by a camera that Director Rob Bliss had in his backpack as he walked several feet of front of Roberts, who walked silently along and not making eye contact . Stalked: One man walked next to Roberts for five minutes as she walked through New York City streets . One Reddit user, Murphyslol, remarked that almost all of the men on the video were black and asked the director if any white or Asian men harassed Shoshana. Mr Bliss responded: 'Honestly we did have a lot of white dudes in this video, but for whatever reason it worked out that they would be the ones to say something just in passing, or from a distance off camera. This made their screen time fairly short by comparison, but the numbers were relatively similar. Director Rob Bliss (pictured) has come under fire for apparent racial bias in his viral video . 'As the video says at the end, it was upwards of 100+ harassments, so obviously not everything was shown, otherwise we'd have a video that's too long for internet attention spans. But really it was across the board, just about everyone said/did something while we filmed.' The response to the director's remark drew heated responses. Dr Welsana Asrat, a psychiatrist in Harlem, tweeted: 'Rob Bliss' biased catcalling video serves to support his ongoing gentrification campaign.' Adam wrote: 'Rob Bliss intentionally edited out the white men from that video to demonize PoC. He's a professional gentrification proponent. It's his MO.' Automnia tweeted: 'So this white guy, Rob Bliss, records a woman getting street harassment from loads of men, then cuts out most of the s*** from white guys.' He also added: 'Basically Rob Bliss is a rich white guy with a vested interest in portraying poor black men as the sole perpetrators of street harassment.' MailOnline spoke to Mr Bliss on Thursday who defended his video, saying that his artistic decision to cap filming at ten hours 'showed something that was realistic but statistically inaccurate'. He said that although a number of white men were cut during the editing process - so were men of other races. The director said that the number of white men in the video - roughly six - is representative of New York demographics, according to figures he quoted from Wikipedia. Mr Bliss said: 'The 18 scenes that we show is a very small portion of street harassment that goes on, because it is a small size. 'We got 108 reactions but after editing down, the two longest incidents [involving a black man and a Latino man] make up half the video.' He added: 'If we filmed for a much longer time, it would show the breakdown of New York City and a much wider demographic.' The director also pointed to the fact that there were no Asian men in the video - not to suggest that they didn't harass women but 'that's what's going to happen in a short-time span'. Mr Bliss said he did understand why people would be angry at the perceived racial skew but added: 'On this ten hour pass through, this was what we got. It wasn't accurate.' Hollaback!, the organization which teamed with Mr Bliss to promote the video, released a statement following the director's comments on the racial skew today. In part, it read: 'First, we regret the unintended racial bias in the editing of the video that over represents men of color. Although we appreciate Rob’s support, we are committed to showing the complete picture. It is our hope and intention that this video will be the start of a series to demonstrate that the type of harassment we’re concerned about is directed toward women of all races and ethnicities and conducted by an equally diverse population of men.' Miss Roberts was subject to 108 instances of catcalling during the filming of the video. In the two-minute clip, the majority of cat-callers are black and Latino - this individual is one of the white men included . The video struck a chord this week and instantly became a viral sensation. Since it was published on Tuesday, it has been viewed more than 17million times on YouTube. The video was covered by bloggers and major news networks alike, leading to another disturbing consequence. Miss Roberts, who is the subject of the film, has had multiple rape threats directed towards her. Speaking about the experience of making the video, the 24-year-old told The Post : 'I felt like crying and I have occurrences in my past of sexual assault, so I wasn’t even aware necessarily of all the times people were saying things to me. 'I was just going over in my head and reliving, unfortunately, these memories while I was walking. I wanted to break down in tears.' Emily May, executive director of Hollaback!, the anti-street harassment organization that put out the video, told The Washington Post: 'We’ve had a number of rape threats and violent threats against Shoshana and we’re pulling those down as quickly as possible, but they exist. 'That’s scary and I think what they’re trying to do is scare her and scare us into not speaking out about this. And both of us are saying no, we need to talk about this because if we don’t talk about this, if we don’t get this story out, then none of this is going to change.' At no point did Roberts make eye contact with any of the men she passed or talk to any of them. That didn't stop the comments from coming. When she didn't respond, one man told her: 'Somebody's acknowledging you for being beautiful. You should say thank you more!' Miss Roberts said the number of comments the day the video was shot was nothing out of the ordinary for her. 'The frequency is something alarming,' she added.

"William Buckman, 61, a nationally known figure, was found dead in a hotel room on Tuesday . The death of a prominent New Jersey defense and civil rights attorney who helped expose racial profiling by the State Police in the 1990s has been ruled a suicide. The body of William Buckman was found on Tuesday at the Residence Inn in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. His death was discovered around 8:45 a.m. said Mount Laurel Police Lt. Stephen Riedener reports NJ.com. He said officers had been asked to check on Buckman's well-being. 'The manner of death was suicide,' Riedener said. Riedener said the 61-year-old was found in his room and pronounced dead at the scene. He said no foul play was involved, and the investigation has been closed. Buckman, who was married with two children, rose to prominence while defending Pedro Soto of Gloucester County in a drug case. He successfully won a motion to suppress evidence seized during a State Police highway stop on the basis of racial profiling. The judge ruled that troopers routinely stopped minority motorists in New Jersey based on the their skin color. He found such stops to be illegal and threw out drug and weapons evidence against Soto and 16 others. Buckman famously said he was never stopped on the turnpike because troopers don't look for 'a short, chubby Jewish white person.' Buckman's body was found around 8:45 a.m. at the Residence Inn, said Mount Laurel Police Lt. Stephen Riedener. He said officers had been asked to check on Buckman's well-being . 'Bill was a true believer and a dedicated advocate for the principles of freedom, justice, and equality, and New Jersey is a better place because of the work he did,' said Edward Barocas, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey told Philly.com. 'He was a man with a great sense of humor, a great sense of empathy, and a great sense of justice,' Barocas said. 'He will be greatly missed.' Surinder Aggarwal, a former associate of Buckman's told Burlington County Times: 'He was a legal giant and a trendsetter.' 'The bar has really lost a giant.' Buckman was president of the William H. Buckman Law Firm in Moorestown and specialized in civil rights cases. His last tweet was on 13 October and read 'Attorney shuts down police stop of black handyman: ‘Now please leave our neighborhood’ with a link to news website.

However, many jobs available will pay only the minimum wage of £6.31. This is seven times the minimum hourly rate of 88p in Romania. Recruitment agencies are advertising jobs in the UK in shop windows across Romania. One advert reads: ‘From January 1, it will be easier to work in the UK. This is new! There are job vacancies there.’ Alongside the advert sits an image of the Union Flag. Agencies are holding job fairs across Romania each month in an attempt to lure people to the UK. The firms claim they have already found staff for dozens of UK-based hotel groups including Marriott, Hilton, De Vere and the Pride of Britain consortium, as well as fast-food chains such as KFC and private care homes. The first recruitment fair in Romania for NHS specialist nurses was held by the University Hospital of South Manchester Trust in Bucharest last month. Valentin Porubin-Lazurca, managing director of VPL Healthcare in Bucharest, one of the recruitment agencies that finds nurses, doctors and pharmacists for the UK, organised the fair. ‘More and more nurses are about to retire in the UK and they will have to recruit from overseas just to cover the replacement rate,’ he said. ‘At the same time there are too few future graduates in the UK. ‘The NHS needs one nurse for every eight beds so it is not rocket science that there will definitely be a need for highly skilled immigrants.’ Mr Porubin-Lazurca said Romanian nurses will become more attractive to British employers from today because they will no longer have to wait up to four months for their work permit to be approved. More than 62,000 jobs were advertised by British firms in the former Communist country in 2013, up from nearly 42,000 two years earlier. According to one healthcare expert, Romanian nurses will become more attractive to British employers from today because they will no longer have to wait up to four months for their work permit to be approved . Raluca Stefanescu, from a job website called Tjobs, said: ‘Most of the Romanians choose to leave the country for economic reasons and according to our statistics, more than 80 per cent are planning to work abroad for a few years, save some money and came back to buy a house and maybe start a small business.’ The website hosts more than 200 recruitment agencies that find workers for British employers.It found that demand was greatest for jobs in the hospitality and catering sector, followed by medical services, with 1,471 Romanian nurses registered to work in Britain between April 2010 and March 2013 under an exemption to the previous restrictions. Other popular fields were cruise ships, restaurants and catering, agriculture, construction, engineering, childcare and elderly care.","Some of the adverts have attracted more than 500 applicants .

"Parents have criticised a school which allowed only pupils who had hit academic targets to join in with a non-uniform day. Children who had achieved their ‘accelerated reading target’ at Woodland Middle School in Flitwick, Bedfordshire, were allowed to wear their own clothes on Friday. However, those who had fallen short had to stick with uniform. Under fire: Children who had achieved their 'accelerated reading target' at Woodland Middle School (pictured) in Flitwick, Bedfordshire, were allowed to wear their own clothes on Friday . One parent, who did not want to be named, said: ‘My son isn’t academic but he is good at other things. I understand that those who have hit their target deserve a reward but not by isolating those who haven’t.’ Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the idea was ‘the same as putting a dunce’s hat on a child’. 'I think it’s extremely discriminatory. It’s depressing for children who have to wear school uniform,' he said. 'The children should feel rewarded, a badge or a certificate is fine, but it’s like the achievment in itself isn’t good enough anymore. 'Isolating': However, youngsters who had fallen short of their targets had to stick with uniform (file picture) 'It could work if most of the school are hitting their targets but it would be cruel for the children who are in the school uniform. 'It’s the equivalent of putting a dunce’s hat on them in Victorian times. And of course, if only five to 10 per cent of pupils are hitting targets and wearing their own clothes they could also be bullied for it. 'It’s inappropriate, discriminatory and unwise in the worst possible sense.' But Woodland Middle School, which caters for pupils aged nine to 13, defended its decision. Deputy Headteacher, Sharon Hardacre, said: 'At Woodland Middle School we reward the positives as much as possible. 'One such reward is the use of a mufti day. Targets . are not ""unobtainable"" or ""aspirational"" but rather will be achieved if . the child reads books at their level and takes quizzes.' And parent agreed, saying: 'I was really pleased that my son got a reward for reading, he had worked hard. 'I know people have different opinions but I don’t see the problem.'","Children who met 'accelerated reading target' wore own clothes on Friday .

"Bully: Debbie Collinson is allowed to continue teaching but is banned from working as a headteacher again . A bullying headmistress who created 'a culture of fear and intimidation' for teachers has been banned from the job for life. Debbie Collinson 'bullied, intimidated and swore' at teachers and encouraged staff to openly criticise each other. She told one 31-year-old female teacher: 'Have I made a mistake in employing you? I hope you're not one of those mothers who take time off to be with their children'. Collinson, in her late 40s, even invited pupils to meetings where they dished the dirt on teachers in exchange for coke and doughnuts. On another occasion, she swore at staff regarding a school play and verbally abused a teacher when she requested time off. She also urged staff to falsely improve pupil attendance records and test scores. Collinson was headteacher at the 430-pupil Harrow Gate Primary School in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, between January 1, 2000 and March 24, 2010. Surprisingly in 2008, she was hailed by education chiefs for 'demonstrating the best sort of resilient and courageous leadership'. But she was found guilty of professional misconduct at the General Teaching Council (GTC) in Birmingham on Friday. The panel slapped her with a conditional registration order, banning her from ever working as a headteacher again. However, she is still free to work as a teacher. Harrow Gate Primary School: Debbie Collinson created a 'culture of fear' Chairwoman Dr Barbara Hibbert said: 'Ms Collinson's behaviour demonstrated a wholesale disregard for the standards expected of a headteacher. 'It is simply unacceptable to manage a school in the manner in which she did, whatever the motivation. 'Fundamentally this case involves Ms Collinson's failure to properly exercise her position of authority as a headteacher. 'Either directly or by creating a . culture of fear and intimidation, she bullied colleagues and sought to . falsify records and test results. 'Such . behaviour is clearly unacceptable particularly for a headteacher who . has a responsibility for setting an example to others and exercising a positive leadership role. 'We consider that it is appropriate that Ms Collinson be allowed to continue teaching but in view of her failings in her role as a headteacher, she should never be allowed to hold that role again'. The panel heard that Collinson would also reshuffle staff to different posts and assign them to different areas of the school as a punishment tactic. She even ordered teachers 'to make life difficult' for a colleague returning from maternity leave. In a bid to boost the school's reputation, Collinson also instructed staff to amend attendance records and test results, and 'condoned givinginappropriate assistance to pupils in tests'. During the spring term in 2008, she gave admin staff 'no alternative but to falsify attendance records' after telling them a 95 per cent attendance record had to be achieved. Between 2007 and 2008, she instructed teachers to amend the results of numerous tests, including KS1 Literacy and Numeracy exams and SATs tests. Collinson has 28 days to appeal the ruling. She no longer works at Harrow Gate Primary School but it is not known if she is teaching elsewhere.","Debbie Collinson swore at staff over school play .

"A US couple says they were escorted off a plane and met by police inside the terminal after their young son broke into tantrums and they argued with flight attendants over his seat. Father Leo Khalfin said the conflict began when he placed his crying son, Sam, in his lap just before take-off on a Frontier Airlines flight from Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, to St Louis. Missouri. A flight attendant told the couple, from Chesterfield, Missouri, that their two-year-old had to be buckled in his own seat, based on company policy, even though he sat in his father’s lap during take-off on the way to the Caribbean nation. Scroll down for video . Regina Khalfin, holding her two-year-old son Sam, and her husband claim they were escorted off a plane . Like most airlines, Frontier’s policy allows children from seven days old to two years old to travel on the lap of an adult. Mr Khalfin said he complied with the request: ‘I put him in the seat. I buckled him in and he was of course screaming and yelling and you know, I held him with force.’ But the flight attendant returned and threatened to kick the family off the plane as his son, who was on his first holiday abroad, continued to cry, he claimed. He told NBC affiliate KSDK: ‘She said, well your son is too loud, you know, if you're not going to keep him calm in the next three minutes, you guys are going to have to leave the plane.’ His son calmed down but had another outburst during turbulence, leading to more tension between the couple and cabin crew. Watch the full video report here. The Khalfins say a flight attendant threatened to kick them off the flight if their son didn't stop crying . When the plane landed in St Louis the family was escorted off the plane and met by police 'like criminals', said Mr Khalfin. But a Frontier Airlines spokesman told KSDK that police were requested because the Khalfins were verbally and physically abusive to the flight staff. He claimed Sam’s mother, Regina, threw rubbish at a flight attendant and tried to incite the people around her, and that the couple refused to follow instructions to use a seat belt on their son. Leo Khalfin said he and his wife were treated 'like criminals' when they were escorted off the plane . The Khalfins have filed complaints with Frontier Airlines and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office . Mrs Khalfin denied the airline's claim and said she was just gathering names and numbers of other passengers who could act as witnesses. The couple has filed complaints with Frontier Airlines and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office, KSDK reported. The child seating policy used by Frontier Airlines is applied by many other carriers.

"Eurostar passengers travelling between London and Paris will soon have their journey time cut by 15 minutes, after the company unveiled a fleet of new high-speed trains. By the end of next year, travellers will be able to make the 306-mile trip to Paris through the Channel Tunnel in just two hours, thanks to a 200mph state-of-the-art train. Built by German firm Siemens and capable of carrying 900 passengers, the e320 trains will replace the current coach Class 373/1 trains which run at up to 186mph. Scroll down for video . By the end of next year, travellers will be able to make the 306-mile trip from London to Paris in just two hours, thanks to a 200mph state-of-the-art Siemens e320 train . In a £550 million deal, Eurostar originally ordered 10 of the e320s - so called as they can travel at 320kph (200mph). But at the launch at St Pancras station earlier today, the company announced it was ordering a further seven new trains. The trains will go into service at the end of 2015. The launch comes on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the start of Eurostar services in November 1994. There were just two trains a day when the service started, while there are now between 15-17 daily services to Paris. Nicolas Petrovich, CEO of Eurostar, in the driver's cab of their new Siemens e320 train at St Pancras station in central London . The original London to Paris journey time when Eurostar started was two hours and 50 minutes. That was cut to two hours and 35 minutes after the first section of high speed line was built in Kent in 1998, and then two hours and 15 min following completion of the high speed line in 2007. The new trains are described as being ‘inter-operable’, meaning they can run across diverse European signalling systems, and opening up the potential for a whole range of new direct services between the UK and European city centre destinations. The e320s represent an increase in capacity of 20 per cent compared with the company's existing trains . May 2015 will see the start of a new year-round Eurostar service to Provence, stopping at Lyon, Avignon and Marseille. That will be followed at the end of 2016 by the launch of a route to Amsterdam with stops in Antwerp, Rotterdam and Amsterdam's Schiphol airport along the way. The e320s represent an increase in capacity of 20 per cent compared with the company's existing trains. The  interiors of the new train have been created by Italian design house Pininfarina.

"Once a fertile wetland, this scarred corner of Ghana is now dominated by black plumes of smoke and the acrid smell of burning plastic after becoming the world's largest e-waste dumping ground, littered with unwanted televisions and electronic devices from across the globe. While most people would expect their electrical goods to be recycled properly, the toxic chemicals inside can make it expensive to do so, making illegal dumping a lucrative business. Traders from across Europe, the U.S., China and India have therefore reportedly been sending containers of 'Development Aid' or 'Second-Hand Products' to Tema Harbour, the contents of which end up being dumped 20 miles east in Agbogbloshie. Dumping ground: Ogbogbloshie has become the world's largest e-waste dumping ground. Pictured is Adam Nasara, 25, using polystyrene to light a fire . Health problems: The eyes of John Mahama, 21, are twitching, he suffers from insomnia and has debilitating headaches, but continues to work . Waste: Old monitors are used to build bridges across the water. Traders from across the world have reportedly illegally dumped goods at the site . Playground: Agbogbloshie is a playground for Kwabena Labobe, 10. His parents are not able to send him to school and forbid him to burn e-waste . Making a living: Baba Salifu, 15, burns e-waste and breeds goats in Agbogbloshie. While some of the boys are aware of the health risks posed by working at the site, many are not put off . Photographer Kevin McElvaney has now documented how boys and young men make their living by salvaging metals and burning cables to get to the copper inside. Such dangerous work among toxic chemicals however leads to a range of injuries including lung problems, untreated wounds, headaches and insomnia. The Hamburg-based photographer said most of the boys die from cancer in their 20s, but even being aware of the dangers is not enough to put many of them off carrying on working at the site. He said the old lagoon is filled with computers, monitors, Hi-Fi systems, videoplayers and a range of other devices, as a result of illegal exportation and fake donations labelled as 'development aid'. He said while some of the boys are now careful about the risks of working at the site, others continue to remain unaware of the dangers, while some just no longer care. He said one of the young men had arrived at Agbogbloshie from the Ivory Coast a few days earlier to start his 'career' searching for tins between the food waste. Once fertile land: Mr McElvaney said cows still visit their old grazing grounds but are now poisoned by the e-waste . Occupation: Adam Latif, 21 cycles around the dumping ground and brings lucrative tools to his friends, who burn the e-waste . Water: Adjoa, nine, sells small water bags to the boys. They drink it and also use it to extinguish fires . Work: Munu Tali,14, also sells small water bags, often sold by girls in groups. In the background is a shack where youngsters dismantle the e-waste in groups and protect themselves from the sun . Escape: Mohammed Camara, 20, left the Ivory Coast because his family were killed in civil war. Agbogbloshie is his escape . Metal collector: Some of the young men, such as Alhassan Adams, 19, say they will never burn e-waste and focus their work on collecting tins. They are still at risk of malaria because of the amount of mosquitos present . Writing on his website, Mr McElvaney said: 'I wondered why he was satisfied with this situation but then he told me, that because of civil war struggles in his homeland he lost his mum, dad and brother and decided to stay rather here, than to fight and maybe die there.' Mr McElvaney goes on to write that while he felt sorry for the people who lived in Agbogbloshie, he felt it was wrong to be sad while the children played and spoke of their future plans. He writes: 'Most boys work together as a group and help each other like a family. Many of them try to forget the sad parts in their story and focus on their opportunities, which was wonderful to hear, but I had some facts in the back of my mind. 'Most of them will die from cancer in their 20s and grow up without education. Worker: Rahman Dauda, 12, started working here three years ago and burns e-waste with a few friends. 'Whenever possible I go to school,' he says . For sale: Computers that look like they are in good shape are sold untested to customers in Accra and elsewhere . Littered: Mohammed Amin, 20, has been burning e-waste at the site for the last two years . Fruit sellers: Women from a nearby market sell fruit to the boys and scrap dealers . Friends: Pieter Adongo, 17, shows a Polaroid of himself and his friends, Desmond Atanga, 17, and Sampson Kwabena, 16 . Collecting metal: Desmond Atanga, 17, uses magnets from old speakers to collect metal on the site . 'Chief': Ibrahim Abdulai, 23, is a 'chief'. Nobody is working for him, but he is able to decide who is allowed to burn and who does not in this particular area . 'At the point where they have enough money, they often get sick and have to spend it on medicine, sleeping pills and food. 'To earn money, they can just start the same work again and again, but in the end they are not able to leave this place and start their dream. 'So this work seems wrong, but till today there is no alternative in this region. Burning cables and electronic-waste became a livelihood for many people there and it is expected that the e-waste exports to Ghana will be doubled till 2020.'

Hackers: Lockheed Martin is receiving tens of thousands of cyber attacks from China every week (file photo) The defence giant has recruited some of Britain’s brightest ‘young geeks’ to help thwart the attacks, based in a secure area of the company’s counter-cyber headquarters in Farnborough, Hampshire. A source said: ‘We have recruited a very strong team of young computer engineers who are basically experts in counter-cyber. They are effectively all geeks and spend much of their time war-gaming against the Chinese. ‘They allow the foreign hackers through the first few security levels and then can work out, through a process of reverse engineering, where the attacks are originating. ‘It’s the same country every time – China. The Chinese try to disguise what they are doing but their guys are not as good as ours.’ The JSF can fly into enemy territory and attack targets with precision-guided weapons without being detected – a capability which is said to terrify Chinese generals. The aircraft is coated with a special paint and has a stealthy design which means it is almost completely invisible to radar. The Chinese government is understood to have developed a sophisticated ‘exfiltration cyber weapon’ which can steal information by secretly downloading  computer files. MI5, Britain’s security service, and America’s FBI both believe the cyber attacks against Lockheed Martin originate from a secret cell within the China’s People’s Liberation Army. Big business: Lockheed Martin is the world's largest defence contracting company . The unit is understood to be staffed by hundreds of English-speaking computer experts whose sole job is to steal information from the US and Britain. But despite the weight of evidence supporting the claims, the Chinese government denies any knowledge of the unit’s existence and refutes all allegations that it is involved in cyber espionage. The latest allegations of Chinese cyber theft follow a report last week from the US defence department, which accused the Chinese of launching attacks on Pentagon computers. In the report, officials said: ‘In 2012 numerous computer systems around the world, including those owned by the US government, continued to be targeted for intrusions, some of which appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military.’ The JSF can reach 1,300mph and has a range of 1,450 miles, making it faster and more capable than any Chinese fighter. The jet’s invisibility – called ‘Very Low Observable’ or VLO stealth – is achieved through its shape which is designed to dramatically reduce detection by enemy aircraft and defence systems. 'State sponsored': Both MI5 and the FBI suspect the Chinese Government may be behind the attacks, something it denies . The JSF’s hull is made from advanced . materials whose formula is classified, and it is coated with a special . paint which also reduces its radar reflection. The . aircraft’s advanced electronic warfare capabilities mean it can locate . and track enemy forces, jam radio frequencies and disrupt attacks – . allowing it to reach highly-defended targets while suppressing enemy . radar detection. Each pilot is fitted with a special helmet and visor which shows all of the aircraft’s data and provides a 360-degree view of the battle space. Inside the cockpit, there is speech recognition so that a pilot can talk to the JSF – and the aircraft talks back.The jet also has a glass screen digital instrument panel that the pilot can touch to pull up data – similar to that used on smartphones. Both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force will be equipped with the £100 million F-35B version of the JSF, known as the jump jet or short take-off/vertical landing (SVTOL) model, which can hover or land by itself at the press of a button. Such advanced features and instrumentation explain why Lockheed Martin want to safeguard the jet’s secrets. British base: Lockheed Martin's counter-cyber headquarters are in Farnborough, Hampshire . Most of the UK geeks fighting the attacks are graduates of Coventry University’s forensic computing masters degree. Dr Siraj Shaikh, senior lecturer in cyber security at Coventry, said his students were particularly attractive to the defence industry because of their skills in ‘ethical hacking’ and ‘penetration prevention’ techniques. Dr Shaikh said: ‘We know that sophisticated “exfiltration cyber weapons” are being used against companies like Lockheed Martin. ‘These types of cyber weapons are used by countries or organisations attempting to steal secret information. These attacks are extremely sophisticated and are nearly always state-sponsored.’ A spokesman for Lockheed Martin said: ‘We recognise the significance of the F-35 programme and the fact that it – along with many of our other programmes – faces constant threats from adversaries around the world. ‘We regularly take actions to increase the security of our systems and to protect our employee, customer and programme data.’","Lockheed Martin said it was being targeted by hackers from China .

"Code: David Martin who originally found the message when renovating his Surrey home . It was the Second World War code no one could crack – a message from 1944 found decades later attached to a dead carrier pigeon in a fireplace. Wartime code-breaking analysts and experts from GCHQ were all left stumped. But now a historian has come forward with the right codebook to finally reveal what it says. The despatch, sent by 27-year-old Sergeant William Stott, identified German troop and panzer tank positions in Normandy and highlighted ‘Jerry’ headquarters and observation posts to target for attacks. It read: ‘Hit Jerry’s right or reserve battery here. 'Troops, panzers, batteries, engineers, here. 'Counter measures against panzers not working.’ Expert Gord Young deciphered it by consulting a Royal Artillery codebook which had been kept by a relative who fought in the conflict. Mr Young, who works at Lakefield Heritage Research in Ontario, Canada, says the message proves paratrooper Sgt Stott went behind enemy lines to help military planners direct the D-Day offensive. Mr Young said: ‘We have been able to unravel most, but not all, of the so-called unbreakable code of the pigeon remains. 'The message is indeed breakable.’ The message was originally discovered by retired probation officer David Martin, 74, when he was renovating his home in Bletchingley, Surrey.

"Andrew Moffat resigned from the primary school in December and will leave his post this month . A gay assistant head teacher has been forced to resign after Muslim parents complained that they did not want their children learning that it’s OK to be homosexual. The dispute at Birmingham’s Chilwell Croft Academy, which mainly involved Muslim parents, is the latest controversy surrounding a secular state school in the city. Andrew Moffat, who resigned from the primary school in December and will leave his post this month, said some Christian parents had also complained. But fellow teachers are concerned that the respected teacher may have been the victim of an alleged plot by Muslim extremists to force non-Muslim teachers out and replace them with hardliners. Last month a letter was circulated referring to a ‘Trojan Horse’ plot for Muslim extremists to take over the running of schools in Birmingham. The authenticity of the letter is unclear but its very existence led to a flood of allegations from parents and staff at several schools . At least 12 schools are under now investigation by the Department for Education (DfE) following allegations that strict Islamic practices have been introduced there. Mr Moffat has written several articles and books on homophobia in schools, in which he makes recommendations of how to teach children how to be tolerant. One book, entitled Challenging Homophobia in Primary Schools, has been used in literacy lessons for 10 and 11-year-olds, including those at Chilwell Croft. One suggested lesson plan describes a picnic at which gay families are guests. Pupils are encouraged to treat all the picnic guests equally. Mr Moffat, who worked at the school for five years, also trained teachers on how to prevent homophobic bullying. ‘In my work I have met with some challenging views from different sections of the community,’ he said. A gay assistant headteacher has been forced to resign from Birmingham¿s Chilwell Croft Academy . One book, entitled Challenging Homophobia in Primary Schools, has been used in literacy lessons . ‘Some Christian and some Muslim parents have told me they don’t want their children learning that it’s OK to be gay. ‘I did come out at school in an assembly after a group of 11-year-olds held up a poster they made, with the heading “Gay is good”. It seemed like the right time to let the children know that they knew a gay person. ‘Following my coming out, some parents from different communities complained to the school, but I maintain that my decision was the right one at that time.’ The Department of Health's publication called Stand up for us: Challenging homophobia in schools . Mr Moffat has now accepted another teaching position outside Birmingham. Liam Nolan, the high- profile gay head teacher at Perry Beeches Academy in Birmingham, told the Sunday Times he had been ‘incredibly shocked that an assistant head teacher who was doing incredible work around relationship education had been intimidated by a small group of what are being seen as extremists in the city’. He added: ‘The Muslim community is being allowed to influence government legislation around equality.’ But Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said schools had a duty to tell parents before introducing literature that some might object to on religious grounds. ‘If parents are coming from a particular religious group, whether it is Islamic or Christian, and they have a concern at what they might consider the promotion of homosexuality, the school’s position should be made clear to them. ‘We are certainly not trying to silence people who want to discuss questions of sexuality but with young children this is quite complicated territory,’ he said. Schools under investigation by the DfE in Birmingham include Park View Academy, where senior teachers have been accused of praising senior Al-Qaeda figure Anwar al-Awlaki during assemblies. The school also faces allegations of nepotism and misuse of public funds to pay for loudspeakers to call pupils to prayer. Chilwell Croft and Mr Moffat said they did not believe that the school’s ‘recent discussions with parents . . . are in any way connected with the Trojan Horse investigation’. In a statement, the school added: ‘A minority group of parents . . . objected to some of the resource books being used in literacy lessons with some of the oldest children in the school, which explored relationships in different families. ‘The . . . objections were primarily voiced by those whose own religion took an opposing stance to homosexuality.’","Dispute at Chilwell Croft Academy mainly involved Muslim parents .

"Shocking revelation: Award-winning neuroscientist James Fallon, 58, accidentally discovered that his brain bears striking similarities to those of serial killers while looking at PET scans for a study . Award-winning neuroscientist James Fallon was sitting in his office in October 2005 and rifling through PET scans of people suffering from severe psychiatric disorders when he came across the image showing a psychopath's brain - his own. Fallon, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at University of California at Irvine, lived the first 58 years of his life thinking that he was a well-adjusted middle-aged man with a distinguished career in academia and a loving family. Fallon had been raised by supportive parents, married his high school sweetheart, Diane, whom he had met at age 12, and had three children. But then came that fateful afternoon in the fall of 2005, when Fallon learned a shocking truth about himself that would lead him to question his own identity. That day, Fallon was going through thousands of brain scans as part of a research project on serial killers. ‘I was looking at many scans, scans of murderers mixed in with schizophrenics, depressives and other, normal brains,’ he told Smithsonian magazine. As chance would have it, around the same time the neuroscientist was also involved in an Alzheimer’s study as part of which he had done PET scans of his own brain and the brains of his family. Grey area: Compared to a control brain (top), Fallon's brain (bottom) shows decreased activity in areas of the frontal lobe linked to empathy and morality - patterns that have been linked with psychopathy . Standout: Brain imaging scans of Fallon and his family reveal that only one ¿ the professor's (far right) ¿ has large black areas indicating a low level of brain activity called orbital hypofrontality . Distinguished career: Fallon is a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at University of California at Irvine . As he was reviewing the images in the Alzheimer’s project, he noticed one that was obviously pathological, showing low activity in parts of the brain responsible for empathy, morality and self-control – characteristics linked to criminal behavior. Curious about the identity of the person whose brain was depicted in the scan, Fallon looked up the code of the image and discovered to his astonishment that the psychopathic brain was his. Journey of self-discovery: Fallon wrote a new book called The Psychopath Inside seeking to explain how a happily married father of three could also be a psychopath . Rather than hiding the unsettling truth, professor Fallon went public with it, delivering a TED talk on the subject and sitting down to a lengthy interview with NPR. The 58-year-old neuroscientist has since penned a new book called The Psychopath Inside, in which Fallon seeks to explain how a happily married father of three could also be a psychopath with the same genetic features that mass murders have been known to possess. ‘I’ve never killed anybody, or raped anyone,’ he said. ‘So the first thing I thought was that maybe my hypothesis was wrong, and that these brain areas are not reflective of psychopathy or murderous behavior.’ Mr Fallon then underwent a battery of genetic tests, which showed that he had an innate predisposition for aggression, violence and low empathy. What sets him apart from a Charles Manson or a Ted Bundy, however, is that while he has difficulty feeling empathy for others, Fallon does not act on his aggressive tendencies. In retrospect, the revelation that Fallon had a lot in common with homicidal maniacs did not come as a complete surprise: the 58-year-old professor happens to be a distant relative of at least seven alleged murderers. The scientist is related to Thomas Cornell, who was hanged in 1673 for slaying his mother in the first case of matricide in the colonies, UC Irvine's online magazine, ZotZine, reported. Family history: The scientist is a distant cousin of Lizzie Borden, who was acquitted in the grisly hatchet murders of her father and stepmother in 1892 . Mr Fallon has an innate predisposition for aggression, violence and low empathy, but those qualities manifest themselves in him in extreme competitiveness and at times obnoxious antics . Fallon’s other infamous kin is Lizzie Borden, who was put on trial but acquitted in the grisly hatchet murders of her father and stepmother in 1892. ‘Mom's happy the killers are on my father's side of the family,’ Fallon quipped to ZotZine. It is hard to define exactly what makes a person a psychopath. In fact, psychopathy has such a wide variety of symptoms that it does not even appear in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Fallon believes that thanks in large part to his upbringing and support from his extended family, he has been able to channel and damp down his innate psychopathic leanings. ‘I’m obnoxiously competitive. I won’t . let my grandchildren win games. I’m kind of an a**hole, and I do jerky . things that piss people off,’ he admitted. ‘But while I’m aggressive, my aggression is sublimated. I’d rather beat someone in an argument . than beat them up.’ According . to Fallon's theory, his ability not to act on his psychopathy is rooted . in the unconditional love that his parents had given him. Family matters: Fallon had been raised by supportive parents, married his high school sweetheart, Diane (pictured), who he had met at age 12, and had three children . Secret of his success: Fallon's theory is that his ability not to act on his psychopathy is rooted in the unconditional love that his parents had given him, steering him away from a dangerous path . The 58-year-old explained that his mother had had several miscarriages before finally welcoming him into the world, so to his parents he was a golden boy who was dotted upon. ‘I had a charmed childhood; I was never abused. No one's done anything bad enough to turn me into a killer,’ he said. ‘It shows that your genes are not a jail sentence.’ Around the time puberty hit, Fallon's parents noticed that the boy was starting to show some unsettling traits, and so the family rallied around him, he told NPR, steering the troubled adolescent away from a perilous path that potentially could have led him to an early grave or a prison cell. In the wake of the stunting revelation about his genetic makeup, Fallon has been consciously altering his behavior and making efforts to think about other people's feelings - something that does not come naturally to him.","University of California at Irvine professor James Fallon, 58, made the discovery in 2005 while going though PET scans of serial killers .

"The British diplomat who fell to his death from the top floor of a Romanian hotel left a note saying that he was depressed about not starting a family, it was claimed yesterday. The diplomat has been identified as Ian Saunders, 47, who was working as a regional attache to the British Embassy in Bucharest. Saunders killed himself during a bout with depression, sources close the investigation told the Actualmm.com news service in Romania. Ian Saunders, 47, a British diplomat working from the UK embassy in Romania, died after falling from the top floor of the Mara Hotel in Baia Mare, Romania . The diplomat is reported to have 'balanced on a rail', before jumping from the top floor balcony of the Mara Hotel . Saunders checked in to the Hotel Mara in Baia Mare on January 14 at 10pm, and asked hotel staff to give him a room on the top floor, according to local news reports. He was due to leave on Thursday, but instead asked to extend his stay by another day. Reports say that onlookers saw him balanced a railing outside his hotel room, and that after they called emergency services, he jumped from the seventh floor balcony. Emergency services arrived at the scene and attempted to resuscitate him, but they were unsuccessful. In a statement, a spokesman from the embassy said: 'We are aware of the information that appeared in the media. At this point we can not confirm or deny that information.' Ian Saunders began his career as a diplomat in 2001, and since 8 January 2010 worked as a regional attache to the British Embassy in Bucharest. Saunders had taken trips to places in and around eastern Europe, posting holiday pictures on Facebook of him visiting Hungarian cities like Budapest and Esztergom. Saunders previously set his profile picture to one of skydiver Felix Baumgartner, who broke the world record for highest parachute jump after falling 39 kilometers, during his world record attempt. Other pictures, like one from September 2012, showed him swimming with penguins in the ocean, while another showed he was at the Sziget festival, one of the largest music festivals in eastern Europe, in 2011. The Mara Hotel is a three star hotel in the city of Baja Mare in Romania, over seven hours drive from Bucharest, where Saunders was working as an attache to the British Embassy . The reports began yesterday when Realitatea TV broadcast that a diplomat at the British embassy had he jumped from the seventh floor of the Mara Hotel, showing images of a body in a white sheet being put into a vehicle. Videos showed police swarming outside of the hotel to cordon off the area, covering the body in a white sheet to shield it from the public's view. Realitatea TV then broadcast footage of the body being lifted up from the pavement, carried to a van, and placed in the back of it. The British foreign office commented on the TV footage, saying: 'We are aware of reports and looking into them.' Police spokeswoman Dumitrita Rus said at the time that an investigation was underway, but she declined to provide further information .","Ian Saunders, 47, fell from the top floor of a hotel in Baia Mare .

"Many conspiracy theorists unhappy with the official account of the assassination of John F. Kennedy have pointed to evidence they believe shows that the president was shot twice, from different directions. Now a new documentary has come up with a new twist on the conspiracy theory, claiming that a Secret Service agent was the man who fired that shot... by accident. JFK: The Smoking Gun claims that George Hickey, a Secret Service man riding in the car behind Kennedy, accidentally fired his weapon on November 22, 1963. What really happened? Secret Service agent Clint Hill stands on the rear bumper of JFK's car as Jackie bends over her husband moments after he was shot as they drove through Dallas, Texas . It alleges that a cover-up was then carried out to save the blushes of the agency whose main role is to protect serving and former U.S. leaders - leaving the many loose ends that have long raised suspicions. It is said that as much as 75 per cent of the American public do not believe the official account of the Kennedy assassination. The new documentary is based on the work of Colin McLaren, a veteran Australian police detective who has undertaken a four-year investigation into the killing. His theories are based on the work of Howard Donahue, who spent two decades probing the assassination and whose work was presented in the book Mortal Error: The Shot That Killed JFK, by Bonar Menninger. Both Mr Menninger and Mr McLared spoke yesterday about the film at the Television Critics Association press tour in Los Angeles, California. He wanted people to feel close to him: President Kennedy asked to travel in an open-top car while officers were told to slow right down to allow the crowds to see the first couple . Central to their case is the claim that Agent Hickey and his Secret Service colleagues had been out partying the night before Kennedy's motorcade drove through Dallas. To compound the problems the hungover agent faced, McLaren says he has found evidence that Hickey had not been properly trained to use the AR-15 gun he was carrying that morning. 'It was his first time in the follow car, his first time holding the assault weapon he was using,' the Huffington Post reported McLaren as saying. The theory is that as the assassin . opened fire, Hickey grabbed his own gun. But when the whole motorcade . shunted to a halt, the agent was jolted by the sudden stop and . accidentally pulled the trigger - firing a bullet straight at the back . of Kennedy's head. Mr . McLaren said he believes Agent Hickey's AR-15 was loaded with different . from the ammunition used by Lee Harvey Oswald, who the Warren Commission . declared in 1964 to be the lone gunman in the assassination. That, he . claims, explains what they believe are the different ballistic profiles . of the two bullets that struck Kennedy. The first description of the shooter was broadcast at 12.35pm. At 1.51pm officers reported Lee Harvey Oswald had been apprehended . Oswald was himself assassinated before he could stand trial over the killing. Mr Menninger insisted that they do not believe that Agent Hickey intentionally fired at Kennedy. Rather, the Huffington Post reported him as saying, 'this was a tragic accident in the heat of the moment.' But the pair do allege that the government moved swiftly, with the help of Kennedy's brother Robert, to cover up the Secret Service's involvement and save the agency from embarrassment. Agent Hickey, who died two years ago,  said in his witness statement given the day after Kennedy's assassination that after he heard the gunfire he did indeed rise to his feet and load and cock the AR-15, but did not fire it. He said: 'At the end of the last report I reached to the bottom of the car and picked up the AR 15 rifle, cocked and loaded it, and turned to the rear. 'At this point the cars were passing under the over-pass and as a result we had left the scene of the shooting. I kept the AR 15 rifle ready as we proceeded at a high rate of speed to the hospital.' Mr Menninger's book, which was published in 1992, claims that it was a shot from Agent Hickey's gun that actually killed the president, citing evidence which appeared to show that Kennedy was hit by two different kinds of bullet. AR-15 rounds are encased in thin copper and tend to break up upon impact, as did the shot that struck Kennedy in the head. A 6.5mm Mannlicher-Carcano bullet of the kind known to have been fired by Oswald, on the other hand, would not break up when it hit the target. Agent Hickey sued Mr Menninger in 1995 over the allegations contained in Moral Error, but the case was dismissed after a judge ruled that he had taken too long after the book's publication to file his case. Rufus W. Youngblood, the agent in charge of the Secret Service detail protecting Vice President Lyndon Johnson on the day, also denied suggestions that Agent Hickey fired his weapon. In an interview with the Georgia Tech alumni magazine in 1992, just prior to Mortal Error's publication, he labelled the theory 'ridiculous'. 'I don't think any Secret Service guy fired his weapon down there that day. I could look ahead and see [George] Hickey, an agent in the president's follow-up car, who had the AR-15 [rifle]. He stood up and looked, but didn't see anything to fire at,' he said. President Kennedy pictured hours before his . assassination: It is said that as much as 75 per cent of the American . public do not believe the official account of the assassination . given by the Warren Commission . JFK: The Smoking Gun will be broadcast on the Reelz Channel on November 3. A spokesman for the network said: What makes McLaren's investigation different than those that came before it is the fact that he had all the evidence, facts and eyewitness testimony from fifty years ago as well as modern forensic technology. 'McLaren’s findings are a far cry from the fanciful conspiracy theories that usually surround this assassination. 'His case is methodically constructed from simple logic and available evidence using time-tested investigative techniques to solve the crime; including key archival photographic evidence, medical reports and bullet science.'","Film alleges that Agent George Hickey accidentally shot Kennedy in the head .

Interfax saying: ‘During the inspection of the stadium after Dynamo’s . match against Zenit, at which one of the female fans of the St. Petersburg team threw a firecracker on the pitch, injuring the Dynamo . goalkeeper, the police found dozens of condoms in the ladies' room.’ The inspection of female fans is believed to be not as strict or thorough compared to men at Russian stadiums. Footage . of the match showed Shunin jump after being suddenly surrounded by . smoke before falling to the ground and writhing in pain. Suspended game: Shunin was seen jumping as the firework hit and it has been reported that he may partially lose his eyesight . Smuggled to stadium: It is believed that a woman smuggled the fireworks into the stands 'inside her body' after dozens of condoms were found in the women's toilets . Shunin required treatment to his eyes after suffering a chemical burn and injuries to his ear when the firecracker blew up. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was left to rue 'not an incident but a crime and furthermore a premeditated crime'. He said: 'There cannot be anarchy. People need to be put in prison for this sort of thing.' Medvedev said it should be a priority to adopt new legislation aimed at preventing such violence from taking place. A . representative for Zenit fans was quoted by Sovetsky Sport newspaper . saying: ‘What happened in Khimki wasn’t a planned action, but a stupid . act of some individuals. 'If . they are detained, we’ll deal with them inside the fan community, . because the technical defeat which we are most like to receive isn’t . beneficial to anybody.’ Blew up in his face: Shunin received treatment to his eyes after suffering a chemical burn and injuries to his ear . Should be punished: Players and umpires go to Shunin's aid after the incident which Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said people should be imprisoned for it . Dynamo, who were leading 1-0 when the . game was abandoned after 36 minutes, feel Zenit should be penalised with . a technical defeat while the St Petersburg outfit insist the . troublemakers were not true fans of the club. The Russian Premier League’s control and disciplinary committee are due to hold a meeting on the incident tomorrow or the next day to decide on whether either team should be issued a penalty, which could mean a technical defeat. If caught, the perpetrator is likely to be charged with hooliganism which includes a 300,000-500,000 rubles fine (£6,000-10,000) and a possible jail term of up to five years. A fourth-round Russia Cup tie between Dynamo and their local rivals Torpedo was called off in September when fans threw fireworks and smoke bombs on to the pitch.","Goalkeeper Anton Shunin received treatment for his eyes and ears after the firework was thrown at him .

"A Maine teenager suffered second-degree burns on Friday when her iPhone caught fire in her pocket while she was at school. The girl, who has not been named, was burned on the thigh and back when her iPhone 5C started smouldering in her back pocket. Classmates heard a pop and saw smoke billowing around the 14-year-old, who had to remove her pants in class to get away from the fire. Ruined: The green iPhone 5C was blackened and broken after the fire . The girl, who has not been named, had just arrived for her French class at a Kennebunk middle school. 'She knew right away something was wrong and, in a panic, knew her pants were on fire caused by the cell phone,' principal Jeff Rodman told the Morning Sentinel. A group of girls gathered around the student and helped remove her clothes, while boys who were in the class were ushered outside. 'It was sensitive. She knew she was kind of in a tough situation,' Mr Rodman said. The girl's mother, Judy Milligan, had given her daughter the green iPhone 5C two months ago. Emergency: The teenager was rushed to hospital from Kennebunk Middle School after being burned . Shock: Judy Milligan says her daughter was calm and asked to return to school after being treated for burns . Mrs Milligan said she was shocked when the school called to tell her what happened, but said her daughter had remained calm and even asked to go back to school after being treated in hospital.

"Paris has recorded an 8 per cent drop in the number of tourists targeted by muggers... but only after using police officers from other countries. Amid mounting pressure to make the city safer for visitors, police announced that violent muggings at Paris’ principal tourist sites have dropped and physical attacks have fallen by 4.5 per cent in the opening nine months of 2014. The announcement comes after the French capital launched a 26-point anti-crime strategy and brought in police officers from other European countries to beef up security at top attractions such as the Eiffel Tower, Champs-Elysees, Notre Dame Cathedral and the Louvre. Crime crackdown: French undercover police officers arrest pickpockets on the Champs-Elysees in Paris . Paris police say physical attacks have fallen by 4.5 per cent in the opening nine months of 2014 . With about 30 million visitors a year, Paris police brought in reinforcements from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Romania to help to patrol areas visited by tourists. It appears the plan is paying off as police announced this week that violent thefts against tourists from China, who are frequent targets for the City of Love’s criminals, have dropped by 25 per cent in 2014 compared to the same nine-month period in 2013. There has been a 13 per cent drop in violent thefts targeting tourists at the Louvre, while the area around the Champs-Elysees has seen a 24 per cent drop in thefts and 22 per cent drop in minor injuries attributed to violence, The Local reported. Thefts were down by six per cent in Montmartre and around Notre Dame Cathedral. With 30 million visitors every year, Paris police were under pressure to make tourist zones safer . Under arrest: The Champs-Elysees has seen a 24 per cent drop in thefts in 2014 . Part of the strategy is focusing on Eastern European gangs, who were believed to be responsible for much of the thefts from tourists. Police said the number of Eastern Europeans who have been arrested for crimes has dropped by nearly a quarter. Earlier this year Paris officials announced that police from China would be brought in to support the crackdown, but the plan has been put on hold.","Paris police say there have been fewer physical attacks against visitors .

"An illustration of a black hole: A new telescope array could allow scientists to photograph a black hole for the first time - teaming up 50 radio telescopes around the world into a global telescope that will capture the 'shadow' of a black hole for the first time . A new telescope array could allow scientists to photograph a black hole for the first time - teaming up 50 radio telescopes around the world into a global telescope that will capture the 'shadow' of a black hole for the first time. Scientists will meet on Wednesday 18th to discuss the project, which will also test Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. The project - called the Event Horizon Telescope - could capture the first images of the huge black hole at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. The 'supermassive black hole' is four million times the mass of our sun, but so far away that it appears to astronomers about the same size as a grapefruit on the moon. The . Event Horizon in the telescope's name refers to the boundary at the edge of a black hole beyond which the laws of physics . cannot describe what happens. It is a 'point of no return' - from which no light or radiation can escape. Because of it, black holes are invisible from Earth. The idea of black holes was first raised by Einstein in his General Theory of Relativity, and has been confirmed by decades of measurements and observations of space. But it has been impossible to directly 'see' a black hole - the gravity that surrounds the objects is so intense that even light cannot escape. Black holes warp space and time around them. 'Nobody has ever taken a picture of a black hole,' says Dimitrios Psaltis, an associate professor of astrophysics at the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory. 'We are going to do just that.' 'Even five years ago, such a proposal would not have seemed credible,' said Sheperd Doeleman, assistant professor at MIT and principal investigator on the project. 'Now we have the technological means to take a stab at it.' Black holes are the most extreme environment you can find in the universe,' Doeleman said. Black holes live up to their name - they 'pull in' light and all other energy as efficiently as they suck in matter, so no radiation reaches Earth. They appear as a blank space to telescopes. But a 'glow' round the outside could let scientists see the outline. 'As dust and gas swirls around the black hole before it is drawn inside, a kind of cosmic traffic jam ensues,' says Doeleman. 'Swirling around the black hole like water circling the drain in a bathtub, the matter compresses and the resulting friction turns it into plasma heated to a billion degrees or more, causing it to 'glow' – and radiate energy that we can detect here on Earth.' By imaging the glow of matter swirling around the black hole before it goes over the edge of the point of no return, scientists can see the outline of the black hole, also called its shadow. The team is connecting up to 50 radio telescopes scattered around the globe, including the Submillimeter Telescope on Mt. Graham in Arizona, telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii (pictured) and the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy in California . 'So far, we have indirect evidence that there is a black hole at the center of the Milky Way,' Psaltis said. 'But once we see its shadow, there will be no doubt.'Even though the black hole suspected to sit at the center of our galaxy is a supermassive one at four million times the mass of the Sun, it is tiny to the eyes of astronomers. Smaller than Mercury's orbit around the Sun, yet almost 26,000 light years away, it appears about the same size as a grapefruit on the moon.'To see something that small and that far away, you need a very big telescope, and the biggest telescope you can make on Earth is to turn the whole planet into a telescope,' says Marrone. The team is connecting up to 50 radio telescopes scattered around the globe, including the Submillimeter Telescope on Mt. Graham in Arizona, telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii and the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy in California. The global array will include several radio telescopes in Europe, a 10-meter dish at the South Pole and potentially a 15-meter antenna atop a 15,000-foot peak in Mexico.'In essence, we are making a virtual telescope with a mirror that is as big as the Earth,' Doeleman said. 'Each radio telescope we use can be thought of as a small silvered portion of a large mirror. With enough such silvered spots, one can start to make an image.''Every year, we increase its capabilities by adding more telescopes, gradually sharpening the image we see of the black hole.''We will be able to actually see what happens very close to the horizon of a black hole, which is the strongest gravitational field you can find in the universe,' Psaltis said. 'No one has ever tested Einstein's Theory of General Relativity at such strong fields.'General Relativity predicts that the bright outline defining the black hole's shadow must be a perfect circle. According to Psaltis, whose research group specializes in Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, this provides an important test.'If we find the black hole's shadow not to be circular, it means Einstein's Theory of General Relativity must be flawed,' he said. Black holes remain among the least understood phenomena in the universe. Ranging in mass from a few times the mass of the Sun to billions, they appear to coalesce like drops of oil in water. Most if not all galaxies are now believed to harbor a supermassive black hole at their center, and smaller ones are scattered throughout. Our Milky Way is known to be home to about 25 smallish black holes ranging from 5 to 10 times the Sun's mass.","Global network of 50 telescopes will capture 'shadow' of black hole .

"A cosmic impact 12,900 years ago could have led to the demise of the ‘Clovis’ people of North America, researchers claim. A layer of platinum from an ice core taken in Greenland has been dated back to the time of a known abrupt climate transition, known as the 'Big Freeze'. The freeze has been previously been linked to the demise of the Clovis people, the prehistoric hunter gatherers who were the first to occupy North America. According to researchers at Harvard University, this provides evidence that a comet tipped the world into its colder phase, making dozens of species extinct. A layer of platinum from an ice core taken from Greenland has been dated back to the time of a known abrupt climate transition. According to researchers, this provides evidence that a comet led to the demise of the Clovis people, the prehistoric hunter gatherers who were the first to occupy the North America . Researcher Michail Petaev and Harvard colleagues, writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found a 100-fold increase in platinum concentration in ice that is around 12,890 years old. This is the same period for which oxygen isotope measurements show rapid cooling of the climate- a period known as the ‘Younger Dryas’. The Younger Dryas, or the ‘Big Freeze’, saw a rapid return to glacial conditions in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere between 12,900–11,500 years. The Big Freeze is associated with the extinction of large mammals, such as the mammoth, and the demise of the North American Clovis people . Some scientists believe that the Clovis people chose to discard spears (pictured) and were not wiped out by a comet . Researchers claim that debris . thrown into the atmosphere in an impact may have tipped the Earth into . global cooling, wiping out native cultures such as the Clovis people. As evidence for the rapid Clovis depopulation, comet theorists had previously pointed out that very few Clovis archaeological sites show evidence of human occupation after they died out. At the few sites that do, Clovis and post-Clovis artifacts are separated by archaeologically sterile layers of sediments, indicating a time gap between the civilisations. They believe that the sediment is a ‘dead zone’ in the human archaeological record in North America, beginning with the comet impact and lasting about 500 years. But others argue that a lack of later human occupation at Clovis sites is no reason to assume a population collapse. U.S. archaeologists Vance Holliday pointed out that short-term occupation Paleoindian sites—Clovis or post-Clovis—are the norm. ‘That's because many Paleoindian sites are hunting kill sites, and it would be highly unlikely for kills to be made repeatedly in the exact same spot,' he said. ‘So there is nothing surprising about a Clovis occupation with no other Paleoindian zone above it, and it is no reason to infer a disaster.’","Platinum found in an ice core has been dated back to the 'Big Freeze'

Officials from the school travelled to London last week in a bid to attract more students to the boarding school. The London event was one of a series of presentations across the globe with delegations heading to North America, Canada, Europe and the Middle East between now and March. Among the facilities on offer for the elite boarders, there is a 38ft yacht as well as a 1,000 seat concert hall. There is also an equestrian centre complete with 30 horses, allowing students to learn skills such as dressage as well as . According to the school's website, 'Le Rosey’s campus is set in 28 hectares of magnificent landscaped grounds where age-old trees frame our buildings and sports facilities. This exceptional environment offers a full range of academic, sports and arts facilities. 'In each boarding house, teachers living with their families ensure discipline, tidiness and are available to listen to any problems, big or small that Roseans may be faced with in their day to day life. 'Le Rosey is committed to ongoing investment to continue to improve accommodation, teaching, sports and leisure facilities.' The school is located approximately 20 miles outside Geneva with 179 en-suite bedrooms housing between one and three students.

"Fifteen children are expelled from school for sexual misconduct on average every school day. At least one of these will be from primary school, official figures show. More than 3,000 children are excluded every year for offences including sexual bullying, sexual assaults and harassment. The revelation comes amid increasing concern over the prevalence of ‘sexting’, when boys share explicit pictures of girls, often leaving the victims feeling suicidal. Fifteen children, including primary aged pupils, are expelled from school every school day for sexual misconduct (file picture) Campaigners say easy access to internet pornography is fuelling the increasing sexualisation of society (file picture) Campaigners say the increasing sexualisation of society, fuelled by easy access to internet pornography, is behind the disturbing figures. Only yesterday the National Union of Teachers warned that sexual equality has been ‘rebranded by big business’ into a ‘raunch culture’ which is damaging the way girls view themselves. Playboy bunnies adorn children’s pencil cases, pole dancing is portrayed as an ‘empowering’ form of exercise and beauty pageants have become a staple of student life, delegates said. Statistics from the Department for Education show that in 2009/10, there were 3,330 exclusions for sexual misconduct. In 2010/11, a further 3,030 children were excluded for the same reason. The 6,000-plus cases cover lewd behaviour, sexual abuse, assault, bullying, daubing sexual graffiti, and sexual harassment. The 2010/11 total includes 200 exclusions from primary schools: 190 suspensions and ten expulsions. There have been warnings that the number of expulsions may only hint at the true scale of the problem. England’s deputy children’s commissioner has told MPs that head teachers are reluctant to tackle sexual exploitation of children for fear of the message it will send out about their schools. Sue Berelowitz said schools were not facing up to the fact that some bullying amounts to sexual violence. There were 2,830 exclusions from secondary schools – 2,760 suspensions and 70 permanent. A survey by the NSPCC last year found that 30 per cent of secondary school teachers and 11 per cent of primary teachers were aware of incidents of ‘sexually coercive’ behaviour by pupils towards classmates over the past year. And Floella Benjamin, the former children’s presenter, warned of an ‘epidemic’ of violent online porn which is leading youngsters on a ‘seemingly unstoppable march into a moral wasteland’. Baroness Benjamin, who sits as a Lib Dem peer, said girls were becoming increasingly sexualised while boys were treating them as little more than ‘sexual objects’. Campaigners are increasingly concerned about the rise of sexting, which can leave victims feel suicidal . Former children's presenter Floella Benjamin, left, warned that children are being led towards a 'moral wasteland' and David Cameron's children's advisor Claire Perry said the Government needs to 'crack on' with plans for increased measures on the internet and mobile phones to protect children from adults content . Last night Claire Perry, the Prime . Minister’s adviser on childhood, said: ‘These statistics on expulsions . confirm the uneasy sense that many parents have; that our children are . operating in an increasingly sexualised culture which is spilling over . into the classroom. ‘We . need to be aware of the problem and crack on with plans for . family-friendly internet filters, clean wi-fi and improved adult content . blocks on mobile phones, as the Government has promised.’ The Daily Mail has been campaigning for tough restrictions on web porn amid fears that it is warping children’s views of sex and relationships. David Cameron has promised that all new computers will be fitted with web filters unless parents specifically lift them, but no timetable has yet been put in place. Last week the Association of Teachers and Lecturers heard that girls as young as 13 are taking part in homemade porn movies and 12-year-olds are waxing or shaving intimate areas. Many agree to boyfriends’ demands to send revealing photos of themselves, only for the images to be shared around or posted online. Jon Brown of the NSPCC said: ‘We have . seen a surge in calls to ChildLine from girls who have been victims of . sexual violence, often linked to “sexting” and online pornography. Teachers need proper training in dealing with this issue and we must . educate young people about what is and isn’t acceptable behaviour.’ In December, an investigation by Channel 4 News revealed that boys and girls as young as 13 routinely swap explicit pictures of themselves. Youngsters say the practice has become ‘mundane and mainstream’. One girl told researchers: ‘I get asked for naked pictures at least two or three times a week’, while another referred to sexting as ‘the new flirting’. A boy said: ‘You would have seen a girl’s breasts before you’ve seen her face.’ A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘Exclusions for sexual misconduct are extremely rare and are decreasing, with these statistics representing less than 0.05 per cent of pupils across the country. ‘Nevertheless we know headteachers take this issue extremely seriously, and this Government has reinforced their powers to tackle poor behaviour, including giving schools the final say on the reinstatement of permanently excluded pupils.’","3,000 children excluded a year for sexual bullying, assaults and harassment .

"Conspiracy: Nazis hid the fact Erwin Rommel, who led the Afrika Korps before trying to kill his leader Hitler, committed suicide, a police report revealed . A police report from 1960 has surfaced in Germany showing the shabby Nazi conspiracy to cover up the forced suicide of heroic ‘Desert Fox’ Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. Rommel killed himself with cyanide on October 14 1944 after he was implicated in the failed plot of July that year to kill his master Hitler with a bomb at his HQ in East Prussia. Thousands died in the whirlwind of revenge unleashed by the Nazi state after the botched assassination. Rommel, the most high-profile warrior of his country, exalted by the newsreels and adored by the people, was promised that his family would be spared revenge if he took his own life. He was given a full state funeral in Berlin with the regime claiming he was killed by a heart attack following an Allied strafing of his car. Now the man who falsified his death certificate, Dr Friedrich Breiderhoff, has spoken from beyond the grave of the cynical charade he was forced into to cover up his death. A seven-page report he made to Cologne police on July 22 1960 has now been found in the city’s archive in which he details how he was threatened with pain of death by an S.S. man to lie on Rommel’s death certificate. Dr Breiderhoff was brought from his post at the reserve military hospital at Ulm where he was the chief physician. He was told to inspect a person in a car outside by two senior army officers. He told police: 'It was Herr Rommel.  His hat and his marshall’s baton were lying to the right of his upper body on the floor. 'Then a man in civilian dress appeared and ordered me to begin resuscitation attempts and told me that I must not tell the staff that he was dead. Served the regime: Field Marshal Rommel made his name fighting the British with the Afrika Korps (pictured) 'I made a direct cardiac injection and then attempts at resuscitation with heart massage and breathing exercises, as if the Field Marshall had drowned. 'I felt completely that Rommel was a dead man already. Then an S.S. man ordered me to remove the vomit from his mouth and I found an empty cyanide capsule in his throat covered with brown and yellow mucus. 'I was then ordered that I had to put ‘heart attack’ on the death certificate on the express orders of the High Command of the Armed Forces. Denial: Hitler held a state funeral for Rommel in Berlin, branding him The Fuhrer's General . 'An S.S. man told me to maintain confidentiality otherwise I must expect revenge against my family and ""other consequences."" 'He pointed to a gun laying on a table as if to emphasise the point.' The certificate was filled in with the wording: 'Death as a result of a heart attack suffered while in service of the Reich in the west.' Four days later the Nazis gave Rommel the hero’s send off they told the people he deserved.  He was honoured at his burial as ‘The Fuehrer’s General.’ Dr Breiderhoff’s statement was never made public until historians found the report this week.","Field Marshal Erwin Rommel committed suicide after failed Hitler murder plot .

Princess Annette opted for a structured body-con style monochrome fishtail dress somewhat reminiscent of a dress Beyoncé wore to the Met Ball in 2011 while her husband Prince Bernhard looked equally fashionable, if a little informal, working a light stubble, messy hair and thick-rimmed glasses. Dutch princess Laurentien stepped out in a fitted peep-hole number accessorised with matching netted hat and silk shawl.

Princess Mathilde of Belgium and Marie-Helene Angela van der Broek of Orange-Nassau stepped out in shades of pink. While princess Mathilde went for a sugary coral pink in simple fabric and cut, Marie-Hélène opted for a hot fuchsia in heavy lace. Her dress was still fitted and she topped her outfit off with a matching pill box hat and small clutch bag. Her peep-toe shoes also matched in colour perfectly. Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden opted for nude - the colour being the safest thing about her outfit. She looked sensational in a thigh-split fitted frock and large matching hat. She added matching stiletto platform shoes and a clutch bag. Her husband Prince Daniel look understatedly chic with his thick rimmed glasses and slicked back hair, paired off nicely with a crisp bow tie and shiny shoes. Princess Sophie of Bavaria went for a bright mint number with matching headband and shawl. Her black clutch bag stood out in contrast along with her red sash.

The Duchess has earned plaudits for her regal style during the visit and was yesterday wearing an ice blue gown by designer Bruce Oldfield and matching feathered headdress by Philip Treacy that was an exact replica of the one she wore on her wedding day. While it is not unusual to see royal males wearing a cabinet-full of medals, Camilla was also sporting a vast array of regalia. On her left shoulder was her Family Order, a portrait of the Queen as a young woman set in diamonds and suspended from a ribbon. The brooch used to pin her sash to her shoulder is a piece of her personal . jewellery while her pearl and diamond choker is a Parker Bowles family . heirloom. George IV started the formal practice of presenting Family Orders and the practice has been continued by his successors. Each sovereign commissions a unique portrait of themselves which is suspended on a different coloured ribbon - George V used white, George VI favoured rose pink while the Queen's is chartreuse yellow. The Orders are now worn on formal occasions by female members of the Royal Family only, although more than one Order can be worn at the same time. For example, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother wore the Orders of both The Queen and George VI. Camilla’s royal blue sash with a cross suspended from it and the bejewelled star pinned on her waist are all part of the insignia of a Grand Dame Cross of the Royal Victorian Order. The Queen awarded her daughter-in-law her highest personal honour last year to mark her seventh wedding anniversary to Prince Charles. The Order was founded in April 1896 by Queen Victoria and honours are in the Queen's personal gift, independent of Downing Street. They are given by the head of state to people who have served her or the monarchy in a personal way. As a Grand Dame Cross Camilla boasts the letters GCVO after her name (as do several other senior female royals including Princess Anne, the Countess of Wessex and the Duchess of Gloucester). Announcing the news last year palace sources told the Mail that the award recognised the Duchess's hard work as a member of the monarchy. At a time when most women her age would be looking forward to a slower pace of life, she now carries out hundreds of royal engagements each year.Camilla has also taken on a wide range of patronages and travelled extensively overseas with the prince on official visits. Of course Charles was no slack in the style stakes today either, wearing the Admiral of the Fleet Full Ceremonial Uniform with sword, medals and the Cross of the Order of the Crown (the Cross of the Order of the Crown is awarded by the Dutch Sovereign for service to the Dutch Royal Household). In the boldest frock of all, Princess Lalla Salma of Morocco arrived at Nieuwe Kerk church in a dramatic forest green silk and velvet dress and super high gold heels. The raven royal wore her hair half up half down allowing her curls to cascade down her back. Her attention commanding choice of outfit was somewhat Medieval in style with heavy embroidery and plenty of gold accents. Spain's Princess Letizia and Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway went for delicate dove grey dresses with matching hats. Their flapper influence was clear through Letizia's sheer beaded top and Mette-Marit's beaded head piece.

"Six children in Britain will be given jabs to delay the puberty on the NHS because they are convinced they were born the wrong sex. The injections - to be administered monthly - will postpone the physical changes of adolescence giving them more time to make decisions about their identity. It will also make any sex-change operation far easier should they decide to permanently swap gender. Gender identity: Children often want to wear clothes and play with toys meant for the opposite sex. Some grow out of it but others become transsexuals as adults (posed) They suffer from a rare condition called gender-identity disorder (GID) that affects 1 in 4,000 Britons. Children often want to wear clothes and play with toys meant for the opposite sex. Although many grow out of it some will become transsexuals and undergo surgery or take hormones to change their gender. The injections will be carried out at a clinic in North London run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust as part of an NHS trial. It will be the first time children of such a young age have ever been given this treatment. Amy, 11, who renamed herself Charlie, is one of the children who has been accepted on the groundbreaking trial. According to her parents Kathy and Jamie from Torbay, Amy was a tomboy from birth. She insisted on wearing boy's clothes, would cry if placed in a dress, and would only play with toy cards and Spiderman figures. Her mother was not overly worried but at the age of five, Amy asked her: 'When is my willy going to grow?' Last September, on Charlie's insistence, Kathy allowed her daughter to start secondary school as a boy. 'I feel braver,' Charlie told The Sunday Times Magazine. 'Boys can be a bit braver than girls.' Now with puberty looming, his mother agreed to pause the process using drugs. 'He cannot relate to his female body at all,' Kathy said. 'He's in denial.' Until now the jabs have only been prescribed to those over 16. However, supporters point out that nearly a quarter of sufferers aged 11 to 15 harm themselves or attempt suicide. The injections contain drugs called hypothalamic blockers which suppress their sex hormones delaying the onset of puberty. In the past ten years they have been increasingly used in countries such as the US and the Netherlands to give children time to think about their identity. However, endocrinologists have expressed concerns that blockers could impact on a teenager's cognitive abilities and bone density. Meanwhie Dr Kenneth Zucker, a psychologist at a specialist children's gender clinic in Toronto, believes social conditioning may be playing a part. He notes that children can find it hard to think in shades of grey - a boy who likes 'girlie' things can then assume he is a girl. With enough therapy, Dr Zucker believes children with GID can think more flexibly about gender and become comfortable with their birth sex. Dr Polly Carmichael, director of Tavistock's Gender Identity Development Service, agrees to some extent. She told The Sunday Times Magazine: 'If there weren't pejoratives attached, for example, to boys who prefer more stereotypical girl-type activities and clothes - then it would be so much easier for these children to explore different ways of being without feeling they have to be physically  one thing or the other.'","Gender-identity disorder affects one in 4,000 Britons .

"An incredulous passenger has said he will never fly Southwest Airlines again after being asked to leave a flight and threatened with the police unless he deleted a tweet that a gate agent did not like on Sunday. To add insult to injury, marketing executive Duff Watson says that as an apology from Southwest they sent him three $50 vouchers after he became involved in an argument with the employee when he asked if his six-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son could join him as a priority boarder. When the attendant declined to let his children on the Denver to Minneapolis flight first, Watson told her he was furious with the service and was taking to Twitter to complain about his family's treatment. Scroll Down for Video . Furious: duff Watson had to delete a tweet complaining about service before he boarded a Southwest Airlines flight from Denver to Minneapolis on Sunday . 'I was left, you know, very upset, very embarrassed, very humiliated,' said Watson to WCCO. 'In leaving I said, you know, ‘Real nice way to treat an A-list. I’ll be sure to tweet about it,' he said. 'Something to the effect of, ‘Wow, rudest agent in Denver. Kimberly S, gate C39, not happy @SWA,’ he said. Soon after they had sat down, the three were asked to leave the plane by a flight attendant, who told the family that Watson's tweet had made the gate agent 'uncomfortable'. Rage: Watson deleted the tweet that offended the boarding agent, but took to social media to express his anger at the service he received . Disappointed: Watson got three $50 vouchers to say sorry for the incident aboard the plane on Sunday . 'She said her safety feels threatened at this point because of what I tweeted,' Watson said to WCCO. His daughter Lucy watched as the bizarre situation escalated and then began to cry. 'She said ‘I’m going to call the cops,’ Lucy said to WCCO. 'I like thought something bad was going to happen, like my dad being in jail.' The exasperated father and his children left the plane but he then decided that he had no other choice, so deleted the tweet. Flight: Watson holds priority 'A' class boarding status with Southwest Airlines . Frightened: Lucy Watson began crying when flight attendants threatened her father with the police on Sunday when he wouldn't delete the tweet . 'There was no use of profanity, there were no threats made. There was nothing other than, you know, a terse exchange between a customer service agent and a customer,' he said. However, he is furious that he was held hostage to the demands of the flight attendant. 'She said, ‘You can’t board the plane unless you delete that tweet,’ Watson said. Southwest Airlines sent a statement which confirmed that a customer was removed for a short time and continued on to Minneapolis. They also said the incident is under review.

"A heroic Los Angeles-area taco stand employee saved a four-year-old boy from a deranged kidnapper. Jesus Delgado, a grill cook at T2 Tacos, in Westchester, jumped out from behind the counter Wednesday and rescued Grady O’Brien from a North Hollywood man who took him after punching his nanny in the face. Witnesses told KTLA the man was ranting about being in the CIA before sucker punching the nanny and making off with the child yelling he was the father – Grady’s six-year-old brother Brendan screamed for help until Delgado sprang into action. Heroic: Jesus Delgado saved Grady O'Brien from a violent kidnapper after the deranged man punched his nanny in the face . The children were walking home from school with the nanny when the afternoon attack occurred. The line cook bolted across multiple lanes of traffic on a busy thoroughfare to chase the would-be kidnapper down, witnesses said. Delgado told KTLA he heard the young boy screaming for help and just reacted. Witnesses claimed they also heard the nanny screaming for help after she was punched by the foiled kidnapper. ‘He told me, 'It's not your problem, man. It's not your problem. Leave me alone with the kid,’ Delgado recalled to KNBC. ‘I said, 'This is my problem. This is my problem, because why you take this boy?' The heroic man scooped up the frightened child from the unstable man and held him down until police arrived, according to reports. Delgado told local media his dash to save the child was instinctual because he has a four-year-old daughter - 'I'm also a father,' he said. 'There were like 100 people standing here when this happened, he's the only one that did anything,' a witness said. Also a hero: Six-year-old Brendan's screaming is what Delgado responded to when he sprung into action . Grateful: Tom O'Brien, the boys' father, thanked and hugged Delgado before handing him a check to help pay for medical care for his sick daughter . Where it all went down: Delgado is a grill cook at T2 Tacos . Brendan ran home screaming as Delgado tracked down his brother, the boy soon returned with father Tom O’Brien. ‘He ran home and said, ‘Someone stole Grady,’ O’Brien told KTLA. ‘All those thoughts were going through my head that I didn’t want to think about, like never seeing my son again,’ the father continued while fighting back tears. The children both returned home safe and sound, but the condition of the nanny is not known. Locals also took the opportunity to lay the groundwork for a neighborhood watch program to combat rising crime in the area, they told both stations. O’Brien and a host of locals assembled Thursday night at the restaurant to thank their hero. Tracked down: Delgado bolted across a busy street and ran down the kidnapper in front of these tennis courts . Very thankful: O'Brien embraced Delgado after seeing he would like to think he'd do the same thing for the cook's child if roles were reversed . A hero's welcome: Localas gather Thursday night at T2 Tacos to thank Delgado for saving the boy from the kidnapper . ‘I’d like to think that if it was your kid in a similar situation, I’d have done the same thing,’ O’Brien told Delgado before hugging him to a round of applause. O’Brien also gave him a check for an undisclosed amount to help pay for his four-year-old’s medical care, it is not clear what the young girl is suffering from. Delgado seemed embarrassed by the attention. ‘I can't work. Everybody says, 'I want a picture with you!’ He told KNBC. Older brother Brendan, when asked by KTLA what to do if the situation ever arose again, had wise advice. ‘Scream real loud.’","Jesus Delgado heard six-year-old Brendan O'Brien screaming for help and darted out from the taco stand kitchen .

"The positive impact a parent can have on a child’s education is more important than where they live, a new study suggests. Growing up in an impoverished area is often blamed for holding back children academically. But a report’s findings indicate it is the attitude towards education within their family unit that really matters. The research involved two groups of disadvantaged children in cities across England, all of whom were waiting to move into social housing in some of the most deprived neighbourhoods. The positive impact a parent can have on a child¿s education is more important than where they live, a new study suggests . One group moved in between one and three years before their Key Stage 3 tests at 14. The other started living there afterwards. When their performance in the tests was measured, both groups had almost identical average scores. Dr Felix Weinhardt, who conducted the research, said: ‘We have always tried to help the most disadvantaged children to get better life chances and one of the ways we thought we could do this is through housing policy. ‘But research now increasingly tells us that bad neighbourhood environments have no causal influence on these children’s school performances at all.’ The postdoctoral fellow in the London School of Economics’ Centre for Economic Performance added: ‘These two groups of students really get very bad grades - very similar to students who live in high-density social housing neighbourhoods and never moved. ‘This means that we definitely should think about ways to help them improve their school achievements but we cannot do it through housing policy.’ A report¿s findings indicate it is the attitude towards education within their family unit that really matters . The paper - Neighbourhood Quality and Student Performance - considered whether living in a ‘bad neighbourhood’ could lead to a ‘locking-in of the disadvantaged into a poverty trap’. A total of 2,094 children were followed. All were waiting to move with their families into neighbourhoods with at least 80 per cent of social tenants. The study will be of particular interest to Education Secretary Michael Gove, who is overseeing a rise in the leaving age to 17 this year and 18 in 2015 . These areas are characterised by ‘very high unemployment and extremely low qualification rates, high building density, rooms over-crowding and low house prices’, the report said. The people who live there are ‘more likely to be depressed, unemployed, cigarette smokers [and] obese’. Dr Weinhardt used the average performance in the three core subjects - English, maths and science - and combined them to create an overall score with a maximum of 100. The group that moved into the impoverished areas before their Key Stage 3 exam scored an average of 33. Those that moved in later managed just 33.6. The data took into account variables such as ‘negative shocks’ that leave better-off families suddenly in need of social housing and other factors including ethnicity, free school meal status and previous test scores. Dr Weinhardt concluded: ‘The main finding of this study is that early movers into deprived social housing neighbourhoods experience no negative effects on their school attainment relative to late movers.’ The paper is due to be presented today at the Royal Economic Society’s annual conference in London. It is complemented by another study at the conference which links an increase in the minimum school leaving age with improved academic performance in the next generation. The children of parents who spend one extra year in education typically achieve one grade higher in two GCSEs or two grades higher in one GCSE than other pupils, it found. The research was based on the children of 19,966 people affected by the 1972 reform of the school leaving age from 15 to 16. It will be of particular interest to Education Secretary Michael Gove, who is overseeing a rise in the leaving age to 17 this year and 18 in 2015. Previous research has found those who remain in education of training until 18 earn more money, are healthier and are less likely to break the law. Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘The research shows that where somebody lives is much less important than what they carry around with them. ‘This includes what their interests are, how much support they get from their parents and how much their parents care about good education - which they can provide directly to their child and by finding them a good school to go to.’","London School of Economics study into school attainment is released today .

"Two Pennsylvania teens are being hailed as heroes after they chased down a man in a car who had snatched a five-year-old girl from her grandmother's front yard - on their bikes. Jocelyn Rojas, five, was missing for two hours yesterday when Temar Boggs and a friend saw the child in a car near Lancaster Township and gave chase. After Boggs, 15, and his friend had been tailing the vehicle for 15 minutes, the driver let the little girl out of the car and sped off. Brave: Temar Boggs and a friend spotted kidnapped Jocelyn Rojas in a car and gave chase until the kidnapper eventually released the little girl . Lost and found: Five-year-old Jocelyn Rojas was missing for more than two hours before she was spotted by teenagers on their bikes . Now that the little girl is safely back with her family, police are focusing on finding the suspect. Jocelyn Rojas was playing in the front yard of her grandmother's home on the 100 block of Jennings Drive in Lancaster Township when she disappeared at about 4:35pm Thursday. The family notified police and officers sprang into action, blocking off streets and scouring the area with canine units. Police showed Jocelyn's picture around the neighborhood and Boggs and his friend joined more than 100 first responders searching for the girl. Boggs spottted the girl in the abductor's car and he and his friend began to follow the car. Horror: When Jocelyn's family called for her, she didn't appear, and all they found in their front yard were toys she'd been playing with . Quick response: Police and volunteers scoured the neighborhood after Jocelyn Rojas was reported missing . The high school student said the little girl ran towards him when she got out of the car. 'If he wasn't going to stop, I was probably going to like, jump on the car,' Boggs told ABC6. Boggs said the suspect would turn around to see if they were still following him after they began to give chase. 'As soon as the guy started noticing that we were chasing him, he stopped at the end of the hill and let her out, and she ran to me and said that she needed her mom,' he said. Boggs took the little girl to the police and they contacted her frantic mother and family. Police say the teens may have scared the abductor into giving the girl up and their bravery is being praised by the girl's family and police. 'He's our hero': The little girl's family express their gratitude to the teenager who found Jocelyn Rojas . Sergeant Jeff Jones told WGAL, 'It is possible this individual saw the boys following him and it is possible he got nervous. We don't know that for sure; I'd sure like to find out,' he said. Jocelyn Rojas' grandmother Tracey Clay was overcome with gratitude to Boggs. 'Thank you. You're our hero,' she said hugging and kissing him. 'He's our hero. I mean, there's no words to say,' she told WGAL. 'You see the amber alerts and you think, ""I feel for that family."" But when you're in that situation. Oh my god, it's horrible,' she said. Grateful: Jocelyn Rojas' grandmother said words couldn't express how grateful she was to Temar Boggs and his friend . 'It’s just something you don’t wish on anybody. Horrible, horrible thoughts flashed through my mind.' Police say the male suspect drove the girl in a maroon, burgundy or purple-colored sedan, most likely a Chevy, almost half a mile from her home. The latest reports say he had offered to buy the child ice-cream and had driven towards an ice-cream parlor. It's not clear where the man had taken Jocelyn in the intervening hours between the discovery she was missing and Temar Boggs' spotting of her in the kidnapper's car. WGAL reports the man was wearing green shoes and green pants with a red and white striped shirt at the time of the abduction, and that he walks with a limp. He is believed to be aged between 50 and 70 years old.","Jocelyn Rojas, five, was kidnapped from her front yard yesterday afternoon .

"Egypt has imposed a limit on the amount of money people can take out of the country, amid fears of an impending run on the banks. The move to ban leaving with more than £6,000 came as thousands of Egyptians withdrew savings from banks to hoard cash at home. Anxiety about a deepening political and economic crisis has gripped the country in past weeks, with many people rushing to buy dollars and take out their savings from banks. Big business: A vendor sells nuts in front of a giant poster of a U.S. dollar outside a currency exchange office in Cairo as the Government announced a £6,000 limit on how much can be taken out of the country . As well as huge political problems, the country also has a faltering economy. The panic came as the country’s new president, Mohammed Morsi, called for ‘unity’ after a referendum approved a controversial constitution which gave him and islamist allies more powers. The new charter, which the secularist opposition says betrays Egypt’s 2011 revolution by dangerously mixing religion and politics, has polarised the Arab world’s most populous nation and prompted occasionally violent protest on the streets. Results announced on Tuesday showed Egyptians had approved the text with about 64 percent of the vote, paving the way for a new parliamentary election in about two months. Preparing for a fight: Riot policemen are seen on guard as the Shura Council met earlier today in Cairo . Controversial: Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, seen here voting on the referendum, called for unity after a majority voted in favour for the new constitution . The government has begun a series of meetings with businessmen, trade unions, non-governmental organisations and other groups to persuade them of the need for tax increases and spending cuts to resolve the country’s financial crisis. Mursi has committed to such austerity measures to receive loans from the International Monetary Fund. While stressing the importance of political stability to heal the economy, Mursi’s government has sought to play down economic woes and appealed for unity in the face of hardship. ‘The government calls on the people not to worry about the country’s economy,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mohamed Mahsoub told the upper house in a speech. ‘We are not facing an economic problem but a political one and it is affecting the economic situation. We therefore urge all groups, opponents and brothers, to achieve wide reconciliation and consensus.’","Egypt has imposed a limit of £6,000 for people wishing to take money out of the country ."

"A leading university is embroiled in a race row after a Jewish student was assaulted at a Nazi-themed drinking party. The 21-year-old London School of Economics student was subjected to anti-semitic abuse and left with a broken nose following a brawl during a ski trip to Val d’Isere, France. An investigation has been mounted by the university and its student union after a video of the assault was taken and students provided witness statements. Nazi-themed: Playing cards can be seen pictured at the party laid down to form a swastika symbol . The victim, who does not wish to be identified, had excused himself from taking part in the Nazi elements of the game, but became increasingly offended at remarks hurled at him by some students. A heated confrontation then turned into a brawl. The alcohol-fuelled game, initiated by a small group of the union’s ski society, was called Ring Of Fire. Playing cards were arranged in a swastika shape and students urged to drink a shot of spirits and carry out forfeits depending on which card they picked out. Popular: The resort of Val d'Isere in the French Alps where the university group were staying . The rule card for the game made . students stand up and say ‘Mein Fuhrer’ while making a Nazi salute if . they picked out the joker card before drinking. Another forfeit included . the words ‘blitzkrieg’, the German lightning war that devastated much . of Europe during the Second World War.

A video, which has been viewed by . university officials, shows a man being attacked while a crowd chant . ‘fight night, fight night’. The student was urged to report the incident to French police, but instead complained to the LSE’s Jewish Society, after which it was referred to university bosses. In a statement released yesterday, he said: ‘I’ve seen this kind of game before, so it wasn’t so much the game that offended me, as much as the anti-semitic jibes that went with it. ‘There was a mix of personal references and general Jewish insults. 'That was after I excused myself from the game. It made me extremely upset. That was the tipping point for me. Tory MP Aidan Burley was sacked as a ministerial aide after being photographed with a man wearing an SS uniform at a stag party . 'It was a build-up during the game, and seeing the swastika obviously, but the comments built up to the point where I couldn’t forgive myself if I let it slide. ‘I feel angry about it now. 'There’s no doubt it was an affront to my identity, but on a personal level it was extremely upsetting.’ The trip to the resort was subsidised by the university and cost the 150 students only £329 each for a week in the resort from December 9 to 17 last year. An LSE and student union statement said: ‘We are prepared to take disciplinary action if the allegations are shown to be true. ‘Students must abide by clear standards of behaviour set by both LSE and the SU and breaches of those standards are taken very seriously. 'We do not tolerate anti-semitism or any other form of racism.’ Last month Tory MP Aidan Burley was sacked as a ministerial aide after being photographed with a man wearing an SS uniform at a stag party in an Alpine ski resort.","The 21-year-old was .

"A best-selling author has urged the Government to substitute plays by William Shakespeare for more modern works on the curriculum, arguing teenagers cannot relate to the Bard. GP Taylor, whose work includes Shadowmancer, described Shakespeare as 'dry' and claims more up-to-date books would ensure younger generations become enchanted with reading. Figures show that children growing up in his home county of Yorkshire are less likely to master the basics in reading and writing than those anywhere else in the country. Mr Taylor claimed a key problem is the choice of books pupils are asked to study, adding: 'I do think Shakespeare is a real killer. Best-selling author GP Taylor has called for the Government to replace Shakespeare on the curriculum with more modern books that teenagers will be more able to relate to . Mr Taylor, whose works include Shadowmancer, said teenagers cannot relate to the Bard's work, which can be 'dry', he said. He also claims youngsters would be more likely to become enchanted with reading if they were studying books they could relate to . 'Young people tell me that it is a real pain for them and I think it puts them off. 'Not just Shakespeare, but it puts them off books in general. The language and the context is just not relevant to them and often they study it without the performance, so it’s just dry. 'Nobody will want to criticise Shakespeare because he is the nation’s Bard but when I visit schools young people tell me that reading Shakespeare is a pain. 'The key is to get them to read about things which are relevant to their lives.' He has called for the works of more modern authors such as Sue Townsend, who wrote the series of Adrian Mole books and died last month, to be taught in lessons. The author, from Scarborough in North Yorkshire says the Government should fund schools to bring more writers into the classroom to inspire a love of storytelling among young people. Mr Taylor said books like The Secret Diary Of Adrian Mole (left) and The Lost Diaries of Adrian Mole were more appropriate to youngsters studying at school today . Adrian Mole was written by author Sue Townsend, who died in April after a short illness . He says that having authors and storytellers meeting children helps to get young people interested in reading. 'Authors are storytellers,' he added. 'They know how to get people interested in the story and I find that even when we are saying the same things as the teachers pupils will be more open to us as we are not their teacher. 'The problem is, of course, that authors cannot give up all of their time free of charge and so this costs money. I think it is something the Government should look at. 'Funding schools to ensure every pupil has the chance to meet authors and work with them. It makes a huge difference. I see it myself and in other authors I speak to do as well.' He has also urged schools and the Government to look to bring more modern writing into the school curriculum. GP Taylor's first novel Shadowmancer was self-published by the author in 2003 . GP Taylor is a New York Times best-selling author. His works include Shadowmancer, Wormwood, Tersias, The Curse of Salamander STreet and The Tizzle Sisters. Before becoming a full-time writer Mr Taylor was a police officer, motorcyclist and former rock band roadie turned Anglican vicar in the village of Cloughton, North Yorkshire. He grew up in Yorkshire but moved to London in the 1970s where he worked in the music industry with bands including Sex Pistols, Elvis Costello and Adam and the Ants. He became involved in the occult, living a life that was, in his own words, 'into all sorts of weird and wonderful things'. Later he turned to Christianity, taking up a position as a vicar with the Church of England. His first book, Shadowmancer, was self-published in 2003 and led to his getting a publishing deal with Faber and Faber in the UK and G.P. Putnam's Sons in the U.S. for a further six novels. His work has been translated into 48 languages across the world. His second novel Wormwood, was nominated for the U.S. book award, The Quills. Tersias, his third book, was published in the UK in 2005. And in August 2006 came his follow up to Shadowmancer, entitled The Curse of Salamander Street. In October 2006 Mr Taylor saw the release of The Tizzle Sisters and Erik, a mixture of prose and graphics. He was helped on the book by collaborators Tony Lee, Dan Boultwood and Harry Potter artist Cliff Wright. He announced his retirement in October 2009, in order to care for his daughter, who suffers from Crohn's disease.","GP Taylor described Shakespeare's work as 'dry' and claims more modern works would ensure younger generations become enchanted with reading .

"Designs for a £244million gargantuan yacht that replicates the streets of playboy's playground Monaco have been unveiled. Christened 'The Streets Of Monaco', the super ship mimics the key landmarks of the wealthy city-state, including the famous Hotel de Paris, Prince's Palace, Loews Hotel, Port Hercule and La Rascasse. It also boasts a go kart race track that replicates the famous Grand Prix track, as well as a helipad, mini submarine, speedboats, jet skis, swimming pools and . Jacuzzis. A floating palace: 'The Streets Of Monaco' is a concept for a £244million yacht that incorporates landmarks from the city-state, including the F1 track, including go karts . Rob McPherson, one of the founders of the project, said: 'The theme is based around the Mediterranean principality with the primary focus being the famous grand prix circuit. 'The idea was to recreate the circuit as a fully-functional kart track able to accommodate three karts side-by-side to allow for plenty of overtaking. By sizing the track in this way it has driven the overall dimensions of the yacht and the placement of the famous landmarks. 'The Monaco story extends beyond this exterior architecture and into the interior spaces giving a seamless transition as guests move between the various areas of the yacht.' Stretching to a staggering 155 metre in length, the ship accommodates 16 guests and 70 crew and travels at a top speed of 15 knots. Opulent: The interior of the ship is also designed to invoke the luxurious trappings of Monaco . The team that designed the incredible concept have backgrounds in a wide variety of sectors including marine, aerospace and interior design . Connected to all decks via a private lift and spread over three floors, the owner's apartment is the most extravagant section of the ship and features a fire place, double height ceiling, office, bedroom, private courtyard, sunroom and a private sundeck with a Jacuzzi/swimming pool. Rob added: 'The team all have alternate careers working across various sectors including marine, aerospace and interior design. 'The desire to do something new and interesting as well as a significant interest in storytelling through architecture and environment were the driving forces.' The ship also boasts a go kart race track that replicates the famous Grand Prix track, as well as a helipad, mini submarine, speedboats, jet skis, swimming pools and Jacuzzis . He added: 'It took around six months to produce the Monaco concept. I think the team all have their favourite elements but all are incredibly proud of the end result. 'We have had a significant amount of interest from the general public wanting to take cruises and a number of enquiries for potential commercial applications. 'We are actively looking for clients either private or commercial with the vision to realise this new and interesting design direction. 'Build cost is incredibly difficult to assess without a fully defined specification, but a starting price of around $400million would be a sensible starting point escalating from there.'

"Oxford is the second worst university for social mobility, a new league table claims. It is among elite universities judged to be poor at propelling underprivileged students into top graduate jobs. Michael Brown, former vice-chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University, who compiled the list, said that ‘brand value’ was not everything. He called for all students to be taught job skills such as project management. Christ Church, Oxford. The university is the second worst university for social mobility new research claims . The rankings were labelled ‘strange’ by the Russell Group of 24 top universities, most of which came in the bottom half of the table. Oxford came 152nd out of 153 and Cambridge was 135th, while the School of Pharmacy in London came top. Professor Brown said top universities had done badly mainly because most of their students are already from wealthy backgrounds. Many less selective institutions are ‘doing a remarkable and better job’, he said, and Government policy should focus on careers as well as admissions for poorer children. A Russell Group spokesman said the table put a lower value on students who chose to do a PhD and only looked at professional success six months after graduating. Graduates on graduation day at Cambridge University, which also came near the bottom of the league table . In a report for the CentreForum liberal think-tank, Professor Brown devised a ranking which shows how well universities help poorer students land top jobs after graduating. Professor Brown said Russell Group universities ‘do not fare well’, mainly because most of their students are drawn from the wealthiest social groups. But he also found that ‘many “less-selective” universities with wider ranges of student backgrounds’ are ‘doing a remarkable and better job of developing their graduates into professional employment’. Professor Brown said Russell Group universities ¿do not fare well, mainly because most of their students are drawn from the wealthiest social groups . Professor Brown said Government policy had focused too narrowly on increasing the number of disadvantaged pupils getting to university in the first place, without considering how well they fare after leaving. These students often lacked the contacts and know-how of their middle-class peers which helped them land professional jobs. ‘In terms of graduation performance and employment outcomes students from areas of high disadvantage have a lower success rate than those from more advantaged backgrounds,’ said Professor Brown. ‘And despite the political focus on access to Russell Group universities, the most selective institutions do not necessarily deliver the best professional graduate outcomes for disadvantaged students either. It is time to raise the game.’ He called on the Government to rank universities officially using a table similar to his own. But Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group, said it rejected the findings of the report, branding its methods ‘strange’. ‘For example, it puts a lower value on graduates who decide to carry on their studies - thereby suggesting that doing a masters or getting a PhD does not represent a step up the social ladder. ‘It fails, too, to recognise that those students from more disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to complete their degree at a Russell Group university than they are at other institutions.’ ‘Finally, it takes only a snapshot of graduates’ jobs six months after they’ve left university. What graduates are doing six months after graduation is not a very good indicator of how much upward mobility they will achieve over a lifetime. ‘In fact, graduates from Russell Group universities go on to earn more than other graduates, are more likely to be in high-skilled jobs and earn 24 per cent more per hour than their peers from other universities.’","Research claims elite university are poor at helping underprivileged students into top jobs .

Moving tribute: Solomon Northup's descendants were shocked when '12 Years a Slave' director Steve McQueen visited them (Washington D.C. descendants pictured) Solomon Northup was a free-born African American from New York, the son of a freed slave. In 1841, he was kidnapped and sold him into slavery. He tried to escape from the clutches of various plantation owners over 12 years, before he finally he got news to his family, who contacted friends and enlisted the Governor of New York, Washington Hunt, to his cause. He regained his freedom in January 1853 and returned to his family in New York. Northup recorded his incredible tale in a memoir which was adapted for the 2013 film 12 Years a Slave.

"The real-life murder, torture and kidnapping case from South Florida that's behind the coming movie 'Pain & Gain' indeed reads like a script - just not a funny one. The fact that the film, starring Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, is an action-comedy has angered survivors of the Sun Gym gang's crimes and those who investigated them nearly two decades ago. 'You are talking about real people. And in this particular case, especially when you're talking about the murder victims, these were innocent victims,' said retired Miami-Dade Police Sgt. Felix Jimenez. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New film: Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson star in the action, comedy film Pain and Gain that follows members of the Sun Gym gang who kidnapped, tortured and murdered some of their victims . Actual men: Daniel Lugo, left, played by Mark Wahlberg, was the Gym Sun mastermind before convicted and sent to death row along with Adrian Doorbal, right, one of Lugo's sadistic musclemen played by Anthony Mackie . Zsuzsanna Griga told The Miami Herald that the movie's depiction of the gang as sympathetic bumblers just trying to get ahead is 'ridiculous.' Gang members murdered and dismembered her brother and his girlfriend. 'It's horrible what happened to them,' said Griga, who lives in Hungary. She could not be reached by The Associated Press. 'I don't want the American public to be sympathetic to the killers,' she said. The Paramount film, which opens April 26 and is directed by Michael Bay of 'Transformers' and 'Armageddon' fame, is adapted from a series of Miami New Times articles about a group of 1990s bodybuilders who hatched a brutal get-rich-quick kidnapping scheme that eventually escalated to murder. Paramount declined comment. The New Times series told of mastermind Daniel Lugo, played by Wahlberg, his sadistic muscleman Noel Doorbal, played by Anthony Mackie, and Jorge Delgado, who is not portrayed in the movie, who were denizens of the Sun Gym, which was known for its hardcore bodybuilders. Johnson plays Paul Doyle, a fictional member of the crew. Survivor: Marc Schiller, pictured, was kidnapped, tortured and left for dead by the South Florida gang in 1994 before portrayed in the film by actor Tony Shalhoub as a man named Victor Kershaw . His words: Marc Schiller's self published book, Pain and Gain: The Untold True Story tells first hand how he was abducted and tortured for a month in 1994 . Lugo, a charming conman who had served prison time for defrauding seniors, was the gym's manager. He hired Doorbal, a gym rat and steroids abuser, as a part-time employee and cut him in on a lucrative Medicare fraud scheme. Delgado, one of Lugo's clients at the gym, had once worked for Marc Schiller, a wealthy Miami businessman whom they targeted for kidnapping. They attempted to abduct Schiller about half-dozen times, once disguised as ninjas (which the movie pokes fun at). They finally succeed, snatching Schiller in 1994 outside his deli. They kept him at Delgado's warehouse for a month and tortured him with lighters, a Taser, sleep deprivation and water boarding until he had his wife and children move to Colombia and he signed over his home, a life insurance policy and millions of dollars in investments. Schiller, who later pled guilty to Medicare fraud, said he had earned the stolen money honestly through an accounting practice and other investments and businesses. The gang moved into his house and then . tried to kill him. They forced him to get drunk, put him in a car and . set it on fire. They then crashed it into a utility pole. When he . staggered out, they ran him over with another car - twice. Somehow, he . survived. Schiller, then 34, woke up in the . hospital and told staff what had happened. He said they just went about . their duties, so he contacted his attorney and hired a private . investigator, Ed Du Bois. Comedic reenactment: The gang members attempted to abduct Schiller about half-dozen times, as comically captured by Mark Wahlberg here in the film, before they finally succeeded in 1994 . Storyline: The gang moved into Schiller's house and stole his money before unsuccessfully trying to kill him multiple times . Numerous news reports over the years have said Schiller hired the investigator to get his money back; however, Schiller said he wanted the investigator to gather evidence that could be used to prosecute his kidnappers because 'no was listening' to him. Four months later, he sent Du Bois to the Miami-Dade police with the reams of evidence he had collected. Nothing happened. Du Bois, who makes a cameo as a detective in the movie, gave the film company and director credit for making an adaption of the true story. 'If you read the original article, the basic elements are in the movie but there is a lot of Hollywood in that movie,' he said. In the movie, Schiller is renamed 'Victor Kershaw.' Played by Tony Shalhoub, who starred in TV's 'Monk,' Adaptation: Schiller's private investigator, Ed Du Bois, makes a cameo in the film and gave it his approval on the facts being there, despite noting its elaborate Hollywood reenactment . Kershaw . is described by Wahlberg's character as a criminal who deserves to have . bad things happen to him. Surrounded by women in skimpy bikinis, he's . seen in a pool while smoking a cigar. That image, Schiller said, couldn't be further from the truth. 'It's not who I am,' said Schiller, who now works in an accounting office. He says he was married and a homebody at the time of the kidnapping and never smoked cigars. 'It's supposed to represent me but it doesn't.' The movie also gives some details about at least one killing that happened after Schiller's escape, although it is unclear how that is done. Paramount rejected an AP request to view the film in advance. In reality, the gang targeted Frank Griga, a Hungarian immigrant who had gotten rich running a phone sex operation - Doorbal's girlfriend knew him from the strip club where she worked. Under the pretense of proposing a business deal, the gang invited Griga and his girlfriend, Krisztina Furton, to dinner with the intent to kidnap them. Reality: Lugo and Doorbal were convicted of murder and are sentenced to death while Delgado got 15 years, the movie is to be released on April 26 . But Griga fought back and was beaten to death. Furton was killed with an overdose of horse tranquilizer. Their bodies were taken to the same warehouse where Schiller had been held and dismembered. The bodies were dumped and the parts were put into drums and buckets and then discarded around South Florida. (One movie trailer shows a small dog carrying a severed toe in its mouth around a posh home). When Griga and Furton were reported missing, the investigation quickly focused on the Sun Gym gang. Delgado became a prosecution witness against Lugo and Doorbal, who were convicted of murder in 1998 and sentenced to death. They are awaiting execution. Delgado got 15 years. Others were also convicted for their roles. Jimenez, the detective, was often assigned to show actors - including Kevin Bacon - what it was like to ride in a squad car. As they cruised, he would tell them about the Sun Gym case. 'Their response was: `I know it's true. But you can't even make a movie out of it because nobody will believe that it was true.''

"Republican lawmakers have questioned President Barack Obama's strategy in Iraq warning that the failure to annihilate Islamic extremists now could lead to future attacks on U.S. soil. 'If he does not go on the offensive against ISIS, ISIL, whatever you want guys want to call it, they are coming here,' South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said on Fox News Sunday. 'And if we do get attacked, then he will have committed a blunder for the ages.' 'This is turning into, as we had predicted for a long time, a regional . conflict which does pose a threat to the security of the United States . of America,' Arizona Sen. John McCain told CNN. 'What a weak leader,' New York Rep. Peter King said on Meet the Press, adding: 'We're gonna attack this, but we're not gonna do this, we're not gonna do that. Can you imagine Winston Churchill or Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman [acting like that]?' President Barack Obama selects a club while golfing at Farm Neck Golf Club, in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, on the island of Martha's Vineyard on Sunday. The president spend his weekend golfing as the humanitarian crisis in Iraq raged on . Graham accused Obama of not taking seriously the threat the country faces from ISIS in Syria and Iraq. 'When I look at the map,' he said, 'I think of the United States. I think of an American city in flames because of the terrorists' ability to operate in Syria and Iraq. 'Mr. President, if you don't adjust your strategy, these people are coming here,' Graham said. 'What is your strategy to stop these people from attacking the homeland? They have expressed a desire to do so,' he pointed out. As of Monday morning the U.S. had launched more than a half dozen airstrikes on Islamic militants camped outside of Erbil, the capitol of Kurdistan. It also emerged overnight that the CIA was arming Kurdish forces fighting ISIS. In a statement on Saturday President Obama said his administration would 'continue to pursue a broader . strategy in Iraq' to protect Americans stationed there from violence and the Iraqi people from mass murder. 'If these terrorists threaten our facilities or our personnel, we will take action to protect our people,' he said. But McCain said that America's long-term plan in Iraq cannot be made up of reactionary strikes. 'That's not a strategy. That's not a policy. That is simply a very . narrow and focused approach to a problem which is metastasizing as we . speak,' he said. If he were Commander in Chief, McCain said he would be arming Syrian rebels and proving as much military assistance to the Kurds as possible. The 2008 Republican presidential nominee said he also would have left some American troops in Iraq as well, instead of completely withdrawing them in 2011 like Obama. The resulting situation he said, is 'that there's no leadership' in the Middle East, he said, and 'we are paying a price . for it.' Obama's strategy in Iraq 'is clearly very, very ineffective, to say the least,' McCain said. King similarly said that Obama's decision to leave Iraq was a fatal mistake. 'The president, he started this. He started this downfall [of Iraq] in 2011 with direct withdraw of American troops,' King said. 'This president talks about ending the war in Iraq, all he ended was American influence in Iraq. And that's a failure, and it's on his hands.' An Iraqi official said on Sunday that ISIS had killed at least 500 followers of the Yazidi religion in the last week, including 40 children, some of whom were buried alive. The total number of Iraqis executed by ISIS since it began it's rampage is unknown. Volunteers from Kurdish Peshmerga fighters take up their position as they fight against the militants from the Islamic State in northern Iraq on Sunday. The U.S. military attacked Islamic State targets throughout the weekend to aid Kurdish fighters, but Republican lawmakers say the Obama administration needs to doing more to help the Iraqis destroy ISIS . Yazidi refugees from Iraq are pictured here on Saturday at a temporary camp in Nerwan in south-eastern Turkey. The site is currently home to around 350 Yazidis escaping violence by ISIS militants . President Obama hit back at critics on Saturday claiming that the humanitarian crisis in Iraq could have been avoided if he had left a residual force in Iraq two and a half years ago. 'That . entire analysis is bogus and wrong but it gets frequently peddled around . here by folks who oftentimes are trying to defend previous policies . that they themselves made,' he said. Obama explained that he did not sign an agreement with the Iraqi government to allow U.S. troops to remain in the country because they wouldn't have received the necessary legal protections. 'The . only difference would be we’d have a bunch of troops on the ground that . would be vulnerable,' Obama said. 'And however many troops we had, . we would have to now be reinforcing, I’d have to be protecting them, . and we’d have a much bigger job. 'And . probably, we would end up having to go up again in terms of the number . of grounds troops to make sure that those forces were not vulnerable.' The president placed the blame for the current situation on the Iraqi government, saying that had it not 'alienated' the Sunni population in the country, the Islamic militants wouldn't . have been so successful at destroying the country. Obama has repeatedly said that until a new, more inclusive government forms in Iraq, he would not aid the country militarily - a strategy King said threatened the United States' security. 'We can't 'sit back and let ISIS attack the United States' because Iraqi officials didn't do their job, he said. Minutes after his remarks on Saturday about the state of affairs in Iraq, President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and their daughter Malia flew to the secluded Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard for a two week vacation. By the time the U.S. made four more airstrikes in Iraq that afternoon, President Obama was on the golf course, leading Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to dub him the 'absentee . President'. 'I . think the president should actually stand up and do his job as . commander in chief, should spend less time on the golf course and more . time doing the job to which he was elected,' Cruz told attendees of the Iowa State Fair. 'I . am glad the president is finally demonstrating some leadership, taking . the threat from ISIS seriously, but unfortunately, he’s following the . pattern that has characterized his foreign policy from the beginning of . this tenure which he has laid out no clearly defined objective that . we’re trying to accomplish that is key to defending U.S. national . security,' Cruz said. He went on to accuse Obama of 'not providing that leadership.' The president is scheduled to appear at a Democratic Party fundraiser today in Martha's Vineyard before taking the rest of the week off to play golf and spend time with his family. Next Sunday he'll return to Washington for two days to attend what the White House would only describe as 'meetings,' but he'll then head back to Massachusetts for five more days of vacation.","Obama's strategy in Iraq  'is clearly very, very ineffective, to say the .

"A 20-year-old California man has died after suffering fatal burns in a fireworks accident that happened at a minor league baseball stadium in San Diego on Friday. William ‘Willy’ Calabrese, of Pacific Beach, was preparing a fireworks display for the Lake Elsinore Storm baseball game, the San Diego Padres’ minor league team, when an explosion happened at the Diamond Stadium. The University of California at Santa Barbara student sustained burns to over 90 per cent of his body and succumbed to his injuries early Sunday morning, according to the coroner's office. Life cut short: William 'Willy' Calabrese, 20, was killed after a cache of fireworks he had been preparing for a display exploded all at once . Fiery scene: The explosion at the Diamond Stadium in San Diego involved a truck that was left charred by the blast . Tragic: A Riverside Country Fire Department inspector and another pyrotechnics employee were also hurt in the blast and taken to a hospital with minor injuries . Fireworks America, the Lakeside-based company that employed Calabrese, has not released a statement regarding the incident. The exact cause of the explosion remains under investigation. The 20-year-old victim’s parents told NBC7 that they are in a state of shock. ‘A parent's worst nightmare is losing your child,’ Janice Calabrese, William’s mother, said. ‘He was in the wrong place at the wrong time,’ said William’s father, Ron.

In a statement, the Lake Elsinore Storm baseball said, ‘This tragic accident has left the Storm community devastated and shaken by this loss. We feel the emptiness and offer Will's family and friends our compassion and sympathy.’ Calabrese, who attended La Jolla High School, was remembered by dozens of students, staff and friends from his water polo days at a candlelight vigil Sunday night held at the garden that Calabrese . helped build as an Eagle Scout at Pacific Beach Christian Church. ‘Will . was just the greatest brother I could have,’ said his brother Ron Jr. ‘He was guy that really stuck to his guns a man of principle and he did . what he loved. He really did.’ Stunned: Calabrese's parents described him as a wonderful young man with a mischievous side to him . Fond memories: A candlelight vigil attended by dozens of Calabrese's friends was held at a garden that he helped build as an Eagle Scout . Calabrese’s aunt, Kristina Calabrese Stracke, told Patch.com that her nephew was on summer break from school and working in pyrotechnics. ‘He was such a good young man and so full of life,’ Calabrese Stracke said. ‘He died doing what he loved - working with fireworks.’","William Calabrese attended University of California at Santa Barbara .

Russian President Vladimir Putin says gays should feel welcome at the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, but they must 'leave the children in peace' Putin speaks at his meeting with Olympic volunteers in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Russia . Mr Putin told volunteers today that gays visiting Sochi 'can feel calm and at ease,' and vowed that there would be no discrimination at the games . Mr Putin and other politicians have defended the June propaganda law as a protection of child rights, but critics believe that the law discriminates against sexual minorities. In the wake of international outcry against the bill, Russian authorities have put limits on the right to protest during the Sochi games, which run from February 7-23. Last week the Orthodox Church in Russia demanded a national referendum on criminalising gay relationships . in a move certain to deepen conflict with the West.

The Orthodox Church in Russia has demanded a national referendum on criminalising gay relationships in a move certain to deepen conflict with the West.  Picuttured: Officers detain gay right activists during a protest in Moscow . The spokesman for the church - which . is seen as close to Putin - said Russia should not be dictated to by . liberal Western values, and urged a referendum on a return to a Soviet . law enacted by Stalin which criminalised homosexuality. 'There is no question that society should discuss this issue since we live in a democracy,' said Vsevolod Chaplin. 'For this reason, it is . precisely the majority of our people and not some outside powers that . should decide what should be a criminal offence and what should not.'

Russian traffic police officers stand guard during patrol on a road near venues at the Olympic Park near Sochi this week . 'But if we need to revert to assistance from the law, then let us ask the people if they are ready for this.'

'If you stage a referendum in Russia, . 90 percent would back both the death penalty and the idea of shooting . all homosexuals,' said gay pride parade organiser Eduard Murzin. 'By discriminating against minorities, the authorities want to deflect attention away from other problems.' Clergyman Chaplin recently accused Western governments of being out of touch with values elsewhere in the world. 'Western . civilization still cannot realize that its model of social order is . shared by the minority of people in the world,' he said. The demonstration in a Moscow cathedral by Pussy Riot was linked to the church's alleged close ties to Putin.

"Leeds United were embroiled in fresh controversy this weekend amid claims the club takeover in 2012 may have been partly financed by a fund co-owned by the Iranian government. If Iranian money did help finance the takeover, that could contravene international sanctions, sources familiar with the deal have told Sportsmail. The alleged Iranian funding may defy a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution and is the latest extraordinary twist in the recent history of Leeds, although this publication has seen no evidence to verify such claims. Massimo Cellino is the current Leeds owner having bought the club earlier this year . Sportsmail can also reveal further turmoil lies ahead - entirely separate from the Iranian issue - as the Football League attempt to obtain a copy of an Italian legal judgment that could result in the club’s current majority owner, Massimo Cellino, being deemed unfit to retain his shareholding. Cellino bought 75 per cent of Leeds from Bahraini bankers Gulf Finance House (GFH) earlier this year. GFH and related parties retain 25 per cent of the club. It is GFH’s original purchase of the club in 2012 that allegedly involved Iranian money, sources say. GFH bought Leeds from Ken Bates in December 2012 via a Dubai-based subsidiary GFH Capital and insiders say they were so strapped for cash to complete the deal, they suspect money was temporarily borrowed from another company it co-owned, the Injazat Technology Fund, to get the buyout across the line. Cellino bought 75 per cent of Leeds from Bahraini bankers Gulf Finance House (GFH) The Injazat Technology Fund is co-owned by an investment vehicle in turn owned by the Iranian Government, who, under UNSC sanctions, have been prohibited from various aspects of international trading in an attempt to stop Iran developing a nuclear weapons programme. There is no suggestion Bates knew any money from GFH was ultimately owned by any party other than GFH or has done anything wrong. The UNSC have yet to respond to Sportsmail about enquiries on the subject. Senior GFH officials in Bahrain and Dubai, as well as two spokesmen for the firm, have also failed to answer any questions. The Football League will not comment on any private transaction in a takeover. In laymen’s terms, the League cannot be certain and they do not even necessarily have the remit to discover how money is sourced for a club takeover. On-the-pitch Leeds drew 1-1 at home to Sheffield Wednesday in their Yorkshire derby on Saturday afternoon . The League’s chief executive, Shaun Harvey, finds himself in a particularly uncomfortable position. He was the Leeds CEO when GFH bought the club. He is understood to have had no knowledge of any potential contravention, alleged or otherwise, of rules during the time he worked under GFH. He left the club in 2013. Sources believe GFH ‘borrowed’ the Injazat money to make up a shortfall needed to pay Bates for his stake in Leeds and later put money back into Injazat’s account. Yet GFH’s ownership of Leeds turned out to be an unmitigated failure, as promised funds failed to materialise. The club haemorrhaged money under their ownership, and GFH eventually sold 75 per cent of Leeds earlier this year to convicted fraudster Cellino. No other prospective buyer aside from the maverick Italian millionaire was willing to meet the £35million price tag GFH wanted. Giuseppe Bellusci rescued a point for Leeds in the 79th minute at Elland Road . Cellino was initially prevented from completing his own takeover after the League ruled he was not a ‘fit and proper person’, following a tax evasion conviction relating to a yacht. He won an appeal on that decision, pending the release of a detailed judgment which should clarify whether he had been guilty of a crime of dishonesty, or not. If the full verdict says he is dishonest, the League will attempt to force him to sell Leeds. The League’s problem is that they have no right to access the full verdict. Cellino’s Italian lawyer is the only person, aside from the court, with a full copy. Bellusci (bottom) celebrates his goal with his Leeds team-mates, with the club 14th in the Championship . It has been reported that in the full tax case ruling, Sardinian judge Sandra Lepore said there was ‘elusive intent’ and ‘Machiavellian simulation’ by Cellino. The problem for the League is accessing the document. Lawyers for the League and Cellino have spoken in the past few days and the Leeds owner believes the League are considering some kind of misconduct charge for not giving it to them. The charge, theoretically, would be that Cellino has failed to notify the League of a change in declarations about his ‘fit and proper’ status. Cellino’s lawyers would mount legal challenges to any charge. The League declined to comment.

"GCSE and A-level examinations could be brought forward for  hundreds of thousands of pupils to avoid a clash with Ramadan under controversial proposals. Teachers and lecturers in England and Wales are pushing for the summer exam timetable to be altered to help Muslim students who will be fasting when they sit papers. School exam boards and universities are considering the radical shake-up from 2016, when the religious period of Ramadan clashes with the exam season. Fast: A girl reads from the Koran on the last Friday of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan (file photo). Muslims across the world abstain from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset during the period . One option is to hold some exams earlier within the usual May-June exam season. Another is for fasting Muslim students to be eligible for extra marks under ‘special consideration’ rules if they believe their performance has been affected. The holy period in the Islamic calendar, which requires Muslims to fast during daylight hours, starts to fall earlier and earlier in the summer from next year, progressively clashing with the exam season in June. The clash also coincides with Michael Gove’s return to O-level style exams, which are taken at the end of the two-year course rather than at intervals throughout it – making the summer exams the only chance to do well. This month, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers Union (ATL) conference will debate how to ‘minimise the impact’ on Muslim pupils. Barry Lingard, who is on the ATL executive committee, said: ‘The consequences are quite huge, particularly with the return to three-hour exams at the end of the course in the summer. If some of the big vital exams like English and maths could be rescheduled for before Ramadan kicks in, that would certainly be supported by the majority of teachers.’ Ofqual, the exam watchdog, and the Joint Council for Qualifications, which represents the main three exam boards, have met with Muslim groups to discuss the issue. Changes: Suggestions including holding exams in the mornings making it easier for pupils to concentrate . Another suggestion is to run exams in the morning, when pupils are less likely to be hungry and tired, rather than the afternoon. The government-funded Equality Challenge Unit, which advises higher education, said exam time-tables should be overhauled. ‘Institutions should be prepared to consider significant adjustments to their exam schedules and think creatively about assessment methods in order to eliminate disadvantage to particular groups,’ it said. Muslim undergraduates at university are also affected by the clash of dates. At the University of East Anglia in Norwich, they have already been told: ‘Where a student feels that fasting has affected their performance, this should be submitted as an extenuating circumstance.’ But Chris McGovern, a former head teacher and spokesman for the Campaign for Real Education, said children had been coping with exams for decades in many different circumstances. ‘Where there is scope for some flexibility the exam boards should exercise it, but I don’t think it is realistic for a board to rearrange their timetable to fit in with a minority religion, or any religion for that matter,’ he said. ‘If you run exams in the morning because of this, you may be disadvantaging a non-Muslim pupil who then has two exams in one day rather than one.’","Efforts to 'minimise impact' will be debated at ATL conference this month .

"Tensions between Japan and China deepened this week as a territorial row over a group of disputed island intensified. Japan lodged an official protest after three Chinese ships entered, what it considers to be, their territorial waters in the East China Sea. The move has prompted renewed efforts to cool tensions between the rivals in a long-running feud over ownership of the islands. Latest flare-up: Japan Coast Guard vessels with a Chinese surveillance ship near the disputed islands . Rocky relations: The Senkaku islands on the East China Sea which Japan, China and Taiwan all claim ownership of . The ongoing row threatening relations between Asia's biggest economies could further be complicated by Taiwan - which also claims ownership of the rocky isles. A group of Taiwanese fishermen said as many as 100 boats escorted by 10 Taiwan Coast Guard vessels would arrive in the area later on Monday. China's Xinhua news agency said in the morning that two civilian surveillance ships were undertaking a 'rights defence' patrol near the islands, citing the State Oceanic Administration, which controls the ships. One fishery patrol vessel was also detected inside waters claimed by Japan. By afternoon, all three Chinese vessels had moved further away, the Japanese Coast Guard said. China and Japan, which generated two-way . trade of $345 billion last year, are arguing over a group of uninhabited . islands in the East China Sea, a long-standing dispute that has erupted in recent weeks. Sino-Japanese relations deteriorated sharply after Japanese government decided to buy some of the islands - called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China - from a . private Japanese owner. The move, which infuriated Beijing, . was intended by Japan's government to fend off what it feared would be . seen as an even more provocative plan by the nationalist governor of . Tokyo to buy and build facilities on the islands. In response, China sent six surveillance ships to the area, which contains potentially large gas reserves. There were scenes of violent disorder as anti-Japan protests erupted in China. Japanese factories were forced to temporarily close in China and expatriate workers advised to stay indoors after angry demonstrations spilled on to the streets. There were violent attacks on well-known Japanese businesses in China, such as car-makers Toyota and Honda, in the country's worst outbreak of anti-Japan sentiment in decades.

The long-standing dispute erupted when the Japanese government bought some of the islands from a private Japanese owner . Two Japan Coast Guard boats, centre and right in foreground, sail ahead of a fleet of Chinese surveillance ships near the islands . China's Xinhua news agency said of . this latest development in the ongoing row: 'In recent days, Japan has . constantly provoked incidents concerning the Diaoyu islands issue, . gravely violating China's territorial sovereignty.' It added that the ship patrols were intended to exercise China's 'administrative jurisdiction' over the islands. It said: 'Following the relevant laws . of the People's Republic of China, (the ships) again carried out a . regular rights defence patrol in our territorial waters around the . Diaoyu islands.' Sino-Japanese ties have long been . plagued by China's memories of Japan's military aggression in the 1930s . and 1940s and present rivalry over regional influence and resources. Japanese . Vice Foreign Minister Chikao Kawai will visit China on Monday to . discuss Sino-Japanese relations with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang . Zhijun, the Foreign Ministry said. The arrival of Taiwan vessels in the . area could complicate the potentially fraught game of cat-and-mouse . being played near the islands, where mainland China has launched an . effort to assert sovereignty by sending government ships into the . disputed waters. Taiwan television showed the boats leaving Suao port in heavy rain, sporting banners and large Taiwan flags. Relations between the two countries deteriorated sharply after Japan bought the islands, which are called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China . The islands have long been the target of demonstrators. This image, taken last month, shows a boat of activists pinned into submission by Japan's coast guard patrol . The . Taiwan fishing group said their boats would sail around the islands to . reassert their right to fish there and did not rule out trying to land . on the rocky isles. Taiwan Defence Minister Kao Hua-chu told parliament that the military was ready for any contingency, but did not elaborate. Taiwan . has traditionally had friendly ties with Japan, but the two countries . have long squabbled over fishing rights in the area. Beijing deems . Taiwan to be an illegitimate breakaway province, and the two sides both . argue they have inherited China's historic sovereignty over the islands, . which are near rich fishing grounds and potentially huge oil and gas . reserves. The latest . flare-up in tensions over the islands comes at a time when both China . and Japan confront domestic political pressures. Japanese Prime Minister . Yoshihiko Noda's government faces an election in months, adding . pressure on him not to look weak on China. China's . Communist Party is preoccupied with a leadership turnover, with . President Hu Jintao due to step down as party leader at a congress that . could open as soon as next month. Noda . leaves for New York on Monday to take part in the annual gathering of . the U.N. General Assembly, and attention will focus on whether he refers . to the dispute. Worries are . simmering that the row could hurt the economic ties that closely bind . China and Japan.

"A mother has told of her shock after her family-of-five had a chat with President Obama during a trip to Stonehenge - but that she now wishes she had invited him back for coffee. Inspired by rumours that the President's helicopter had landed at the ancient site, Janice Raffle and her husband James marched across fields with their three sons  in the hope they would catch a glimpse of the US President. At first the family, who live a mile from the monument, were stuck at a fence. But a good-natured Obama wandered over to where they were standing - and  even agreed to pose for a family photo. Scroll down for video . Janice and James Raffle, with their three sons, posing for a family photo with Barack Obama at Stonehenge . Mrs Raffle, 35, who lives a mile from the site, said she 'should have invited him back for coffee' at the ancient monument . Landmark: Stonehenge had an unexpected guest tonight in the form of U.S. President Barack Obama . Dwarfed by history: The President was given privileged access to wander among the stones themselves . Mrs Raffle, 35, who was with her three sons, aged two, six and seven, told Sky News: 'He waved at us first after my husband marched us all the way there on the chance we might get to see him. 'We kind of edged closer and closer until he noticed us and waved. We waved back and then one of the high security men edged us forward and he was moving forward at the same time, which was very exciting. 'The first person to say something was actually James. He said ""Welcome to England"".' Mr Obama had ordered his Marine One to make the unscheduled landing at Boscombe Down Airbase in Wiltshire after flying out of Newport in south Wales following the NATO summit. Mrs Raffle said: 'At that point, he shook his hand and then he shook all of our hands. He said ""It is such a beautiful place, do you live around here?"" 'We said we have just moved to the area. He said it is very quiet and the air was beautiful and so peaceful.' Mrs Raffle - who excitedly tweeted about the meeting while still at Stonehenge - is running the Great North Run tomorrow. It is one of ten major races she is doing, while dressed as a bumble bee, to raise money for Cancer Research. Several people took to her JustGiving page to make a donation to the cause after seeing her tweets about meeting the President. Her total now stands at almost £2,400. She said: 'We should have invited him back for coffee. I should have asked him to sponsor me for one of my races!’ Not a normal walk in the country: The President greets 35-year-old Janice and James Raffle and their three sons. They headed from their home a mile away towards the monument after hearing rumours he was there . Nice to meet you! The President shook hands with the family after the unexpected landing by his helicopter . A moment they'll never forget: The family were stuck at a fence - but a good-natured Obama  wandered over to say hello. Mrs Raffle told ITV News: 'I squealed like a teenager! You'd think I would know better' Remember to take a photo: The family captured the moment - but one of Mrs Raffle's sons wasn't bothered . 'He was very sweet actually - one of the boys had put his hand on barbed wire and he was saying ""Be Careful"".' The President's motorcade  weaved its way for 20 minutes across Salisbury Plain, to the amazement of passing drivers. Under grey skies, the President then embarked on tour of the prehistoric stone circle and henge with Heather Sebire, the curator of the site for English Heritage. ‘How cool is this? Spectacular!’ the president exclaimed as he was afforded privileged access to the ancient sarsen stones themselves. Mr Obama later said he had wanted to ‘knock Stonehenge off my bucket list’. Not everyone was so delighted, however. Motorist Andrew Turner tweeted: 'So Obama wrecked my A303 journey today, then I see him up close to Stonehenge. One word pretty much describes my feelings. A***.' Andy Procter added: 'I wonder if Obama got stuck in his own traffic jam. Certainly made my A303 journey past Stonehenge more memorable. And slow.' ‘How cool is this? Spectacular!’ the president exclaimed as he was afforded privileged access to the ancient sarsen stones themselves. He was later heard to say he had wanted to 'knock Stonehenge off my bucket list' Time for a photo: The 4,000-year-old stones on Salisbury Plain are rarely accessible to the public . Feeling Presidential: The remaining sandstone blocks have stood upright for thousands of years . The first monument at the site on Salisbury Plain was probably built around 5,000 years ago, to mark  where prehistoric people buried their cremated dead. It was only later that the enormous sandstone sarsens and smaller bluestones were set up in the centre, transported up to 150 miles. Historians believe the stone circle may have been a temple, a burial ground, an astronomical calendar or all three. Although it appears isolated, it is actually just one part of a vast system of ancient earthworks on what would have been an unusually open landscape when Britain was an island of forests. Despite its significance, it continued deteriorating badly until the turn of the last century, when passionate campaigns began to save it after it was gifted to the nation in 1918. Source: English Heritage . Heather Sebire, English Heritage’s Stonehenge curator, said: ‘Mr Obama was fascinated by the story of the stones, what we know about them and the mysteries that have yet to be solved. He asked lots of questions about how old the monument is, how long it took to build it, and what was its purpose. ‘He described the atmosphere around the stones as ""really special"" and his visit to Stonehenge as “a highlight of my tour”. 'He particularly loved seeing the colour and texture of the stones. It was a beautiful still evening and it was a privilege to show the U.S. President around this unique monument which continues to inspire and intrigue people.’ Stonehenge general manager Kate Davies added: ‘Every day people from all over the world make the trip to the ancient stones but this visit was a particularly special one.’ Historians still disagree over the function of Stonehenge, which was far more extensive when it was assembled thousands of years ago on Salisbury Plan. Built between 3,000 and 1,600 BC, the stone circle may have been a temple, a burial ground, an astronomical calendar or all three, scholars say. No one knows for sure either how ancient Britons got the stones, which weigh up to 45 tonnes, to the site or what they used them for. Curious: The President asked several questions about the origin of the henge and its original function . Heather Sebire, English Heritage’s Stonehenge curator, said: 'It was a beautiful still evening and it was a privilege to show the U.S. President around this unique monument which continues to inspire and intrigue' End of a long  day: Jokes  circulated that the President had met 'a bunch of immovable objects with no clear purpose'... and then visited Stonehenge. The Nato summit was held amid escalating threats by Islamic State . Long derided as a national disgrace, the visitor facilities at the monument have recent undergone a major refurbishment. Photo opportunity: The moment was also captured on countless journalists' mobile phones (pictured) The A-road that ran right along the edge of the site was closed and grassed over last year in a bid to 'restore the dignity' of the World Heritage Site. The President was afforded a rare honour in being able to walk right up to the stones. That privilege has long since been rescinded for ordinary visitors - except on the summer solstice, when they are allowed to revel in the site's pagan origins with dances and music at dawn. This week's Nato summit in Newport was held amid an escalating crisis in Iraq and Syria, with Islamic State members threatening to behead a British hostage after murdering two U.S. journalists. The U.S. and 10 of its key allies agreed the group is a significant threat to Nato countries and that they will take on the militants by squeezing their financial resources and going after them with military might. 'Outgunned and outmanned' Syrian forces will be bolstered by foreign powers arranged through what is currently a loose coalition including Britain. But critics worry that there are doubts over how the terrorists can be tackled without another major Western intervention in Iraq. And the Home Office is also concerned over the hundreds of young Britons who have flown to Iraq and Syria to join jihadi groups in the escalating conflict. Perhaps it was inevitable that some joked the President had spent time with a clutch of immovable objects with no clear direction... and then visited Stonehenge.

"Bridesmaid: Laura Rees, 23, died in a car crash on her way to visit a friend who was getting married . A bridesmaid was killed in a car crash as she went to visit the bride-to-be on the day she went to be fitted for her dress, in inquest has heard. Nursery worker Laura Rees died in the head-on collision in South Wales just hours after she had picked up her dress and got her nails done ahead of her friend's big day. The 23-year-old, who was buried in her bridesmaid dress, was due to spend the night at the bride's house to discuss plans for the wedding. A statement from Miss Rees's mother Angela was read out last Friday at the inquest into her death at Llanelli Town Hall in Carmarthenshire. She told police her daughter had enjoyed a 'leisurely ""me"" day' before her death in October last year. Mrs Rees added: 'She was so excited about the wedding and had just had a fitting for the dress - that dress was the dress she was buried in.' The inquest heard that the bridesmaid was driving on the A40 near Whitland when she was involved in the two-car crash. 'We will never know what happened that night on that stretch of road,' Miss Rees's mother said as she described her daughter's commitment to her nursery work. 'Laura loved working,' Mrs Rees said in her statement. 'She would often not have a drink just in case she was needed to drive. 'She loved working with children - she had applied to go back university in 2013 to study midwifery. 'I never saw her take risks or exceed the speed limit.'

"Tottenham star Christian Eriksen has been blamed by Denmark manager Morten Olsen for their last-gasp defeat by Portugal on Tuesday. The 22-year-old was slammed by Olsen for his lack of impact in a Euro 2016 qualifier settled by Cristiano Ronaldo's last-gasp header. Olsen ripped into Eriksen's lack of impact at international level and also indicated he hasn't continued his progression in the Premier League since leaving Ajax 14 months ago. Denmark manager Morten Olsen has blamed Christian Eriksen for the defeat by Portugal on Tuesday . Tottenham midfielder Eriksen has admitted he needs to impose himself more when playing for Denmark . 'It is a brutal world, otherwise you have to play at another level. It is not Ajax any more, this is not development,' said Olsen. On Eriksen's display against Portugal, the Denmark manager added: 'After so many matches he could pick up the ball and help to control the game. He has not been able to. 'It is quite something when you have to criticise a player like Christian Eriksen. It should not take place. 'If it was a player at a lower level, one could say that he had no class. But with Christian Eriksen do not make the mistake. I must be tough and say to him. And he knows it well. Eriksen has enjoyed a promising start to the season with Spurs but Olsen says he hasn't improved in England . 'Therefore, we blame him. He must stand up to the criticism, and he does too.' Eriksen scored 10 times for Tottenham last season and has impressed so far this campaign for Mauricio Pochettino's side. The Dane also netted the winner against Southampton in the last match before the current international fixtures but he admits he needs to do more for his country . 'I was on the ball and should have brought myself more into the game,' said Eriksen. 'I am not getting the results in terms of goals and assists and that is not what I want.

"You might not be able to plan ahead to reach the venue of the annual Diner en Blanc but at least you'll always know what to wear. Guests invited to the fine dining experience must only wear white and eat at tables adorned with table cloths and flowers in the same shade. The dinner in white has taken place in Paris for the past half a century but the exact location is a closely guarded secret until the day. This year's guests, who attended the 26th function last night, were told an hour before that they should gather on six bridges across the French captial, including the Passerelle Debilly at the foot of the Eiffel Tower and Pont de l'Alma.

Champagne all round: Some ate on the Pont Alexandre III in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower . Others were told to set up in front of Les Invalides, where the tomb of Napoleon is kept. Thousands turned out smartly-dressed from top to toe in white for the occasion, which raises money for cancer research. Although always in Paris, the event is held at a different location in the city every time. Last year, nearly revellers dined in the outdoor courtyard of the Louvre and at the Trocadero, while in 2012 the event took place at Place des Vosges and in front of the Notre-Dame Cathedral. The tradition began in 1988 when a group of ten friends decided they wanted to eat at a forbidden spot in the city. They ended up dining as a 200 strong flash mob at the Jardins de Bagatelle, once a favourite spot of French royalty including Marie Antoinette.

Since then the event has gone global with versions of the dinner taking place in European cities such as Milan and Barcelona and much further afield in more than a dozen locations in the U.S., Canada, Singapore and even Rwanda and the Ivory Coast. The craze finally made the short journey from its Paris home across the Channel to London in 2012 when thousands of diners converged on the South Piazza of Covent Garden. But the Paris version remains the tradition's definitive one. Each year the guest list exceeds 15,000 say organisers and past dinners have taken place at such illustrious settings as the Pont des Arts, the grounds of the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the Palace of Versailles. Those on the guest list will have either attended the previous year's event or been invited by someone who did. Everyone who is invited must bring a guest and arrive by public transport. Guests must bring a picnic table, a picnic basket, foldable cheers and a table cloth - all in white of course. Men and women sit on opposite sides of the table to one another and guests are forbidden to sit down until their entire row have set up their table. They must only drink wine and champagne and must leave before midnight as discreetly they arrived, taking all their rubbish with them to leave no trace of the event.

Despite a recent wave of gun tragedies in the U.S., including the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, their father, Treves, 37, believes more firearms are the answer. He said: 'With all the recent shootings I feel that armed citizens are a good line of defence. 'Most of those shootings that have occurred, when they were confronted they either surrendered or shot themselves. More guns, less crime.' And in the Evans household, getting to grips with potentially deadly weapons is actively encouraged.

He even drills his young family in how to use firearms - in case someone should try to take them away. Treves from Kent, Washington, also identifies with the militia movement, set up to protect the country from a rogue government. And that includes filling his home with an arsenal of 15 weapons - including daughter Raealonie's pink hunting rifle. Treves even has a license to carry a concealed weapon when he's not at work. Treves said: 'The second amendment is a second line of defence against foreign invasion and a last line of defence against your own government. 'I want my kids to know how to handle guns in the event that they need them.' Treves, pictured with 12-year-old son Roberto firing a handgun, says the right to bear arms is the 'last resort' against their government .

The Evans children (l-r) Celeste, Charlisse, Roberto and Verenise pose with their guns at home .

He said: 'The first thing is to teach them gun safety and the next thing is to let them handle a gun. 'There's no mystery with my children - it's not forbidden. They're not going to sneak in when I'm not home and pull out guns.' Treves and wife Rosanna, 39, are also preppers, who are prepared to survive in the wilderness should they need to leave home at a moments notice. And the patriotic couple want to teach their children to stand-up for their freedoms. Treves said: 'I feel the freedom in our country is being eroded away - they'll just be eroded at until there are none. 'That's why I don't give anything when it comes to the second amendment. 'It's our right and we're gong to exercise our right.' And Treves points the finger at liberal politicians using shooting tragedies such as last year's Sandy Hook massacre to push for tighter control on guns. He said: 'If I give something now, the next time there's an unfortunate incident they're gonna want something else and pretty soon there wont be anything left.'","Treves Evans has 15 weapons and teaches his five children to use them .

"Ben Kravitz of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, California, said that mankind could turn to geoengineering to solve our problems with the environment - but it could have side-effects . The sky could turn from a reassuring blue to a blank white if scientists are forced to take drastic action to tackle global warming, experts have claimed. By injecting aerosols which scatter light into the atmosphere we could reflect more sun away from Earth and cool the planet. But the knock-on effect would be the scattering of red particles around the atmosphere that wash out the blue. The result would be skies that turn into a foggy or hazy white instead of the crisp colours we are used to on a summer’s day. According to report in the New Scientist, such a measure would cut by a fifth the amount of sunlight that makes its way to Earth, though the reduction in the amount of blue in the sky could be much more pronounced. Ben Kravitz of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, California, said that mankind could turn to geoengineering to solve our problems with the environment, a drastic solution once things have taken a turn for the worse. He said that particles ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 micrometers in diameter would need to be scattered in order to influence the amount of light in the sky. If only particles in the middle of this range were left then the sky would look a lot whiter. It would work because the only reason the sky is blue in the first place is because air molecules are scattered. Such scattering is more pronounced among blue molecules as they have shorter wavelengths than longer red ones. By putting aerosol particles in the atmosphere however the red ones would be scattered the most, washing out the blue and making the sky whiter. Kravitz said that a whiter sky might have a daily effect on people’s attitudes toward climate change. Visitors to Beijing for the 2008 Olympics for example were disturbing by the never ending fogginess caused by rampant pollution. Kravitz said that people in the countryside would see the effect most severely, though it would be apparent from anywhere in the world. He said: ‘All you'd have to do to see it is to step outside.’ Other knock-on effects would be a rise in plant and tree growth because they would be getting more indirect sunlight. But the solar industry would suffer as there would be less direct sunlight to power solar panels, perhaps forcing man to rely even more on fossil fuels.","Aerosol spray into upper atmosphere could reflect light away from Earth .

"Britain's high street Christmas shopping frenzy has finally peaked - with only men still 'panic buying', according to retail bosses. Millions hit the shops today for the six-hour 'window', leaving industry experts to describe today as the 'most intense' spending day in the festive build-up. And now it is the turn of 'panic-buying' men to hit the high street, as retailers are predicting 70 per cent of shoppers tomorrow will be blokes. Rush: Millions are set to grab a last-minute gift in the next couple of days . Richard Dodd, spokesman for the British Retail Consortium, said the six hours of trading today had led to a rush of shoppers on the streets. He told the Mail Online: 'It will have been the busiest day, the most intense spending day that we have seen in the run up to Christmas because people have been restricted to shopping within those limited hours.' And he said there was expected to be a significant number of people shopping online as the post-Christmas sales had already begun. He said: 'There will be a notable amount of shopping online on Christmas Day and it may well be that it's the biggest Christmas Day for online spending that we have seen.' Meanwhile, Jace Tyrrell, director of communications at the New West End Company, which represents hundreds of businesses in London's West End, said he expected tomorrow's shoppers to be mainly male. He said: 'What we have tomorrow is man dash, where basically about 70 per cent of our shoppers will be men panic buying.' 'Man dash': Seven out of ten shoppers tomorrow are expected to be men panic buying, according to industry experts . He said overall he expected sales to be up anywhere between two and ten per cent on last year. He said 'We are definitely on track to hit a million shoppers over Saturday, Sunday and Monday, which will be about £100m for us going through the tills. Millions of shoppers mobbed high streets across Britain today as retailers slashed prices by up to 80 per cent in a desperate attempt to boost sluggish sales. Major stores, including Argos, Currys PC World and House of Fraser, have already started their seasonal sales, offering huge discounts on clothes, electricals, homeware and toys. Gap, whose sale began at the beginning of December, is offering up to 60 per cent off. Some of its items are discounted even further, while French Connection has also cut its prices by up to 60 per cent. But while millions went shopping just as many are also believed to have stayed at home for one of the greatest online Christmas shopping sprees. Retailers were bracing themselves for . huge crowds coming through the doors today, with tomorrow predicted to . be the busiest Christmas Eve ever. Although today, December 23, is traditionally the busiest day, trading laws mean shops can only open for six hours on a Sunday. Shopping frenzy: People in Glasgow do some last minute Christmas shopping. Retailers are bracing themselves for more crowds tomorrow . A poll by Sainsbury’s Bank has found a third of Britons will hit the shops tomorrow, with 17 million admitting they have not yet bought all their gifts. About £1.3 billion is expected to be spent on ‘Manic Monday’ – nearly £55 million an hour – compared with £1 billion last year. Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, said sales have been hit by customers becoming cautious with their spending. She added that the rising cost of living – driven by higher food and energy prices –  coupled with below-inflation pay rises has seen many families opt for an austerity Christmas. Others have simply left their purchases until the last minute in the hope prices will fall. ‘Shopping was slow out of the starting blocks as pressure on budgets and fears about the future left many reluctant to commit to spending early,’ she said. ‘But it’s the finish which matters. With Christmas falling on a Tuesday, this weekend will be the critical one – I’m expecting a last-minute rush.’","Shoppers hit streets for 'most intense' day in build up to Christmas .

"‘The natural state of reproduction requires a state of utter and complete frankness that must be observed between the married pair,’ suggested one contemporary writer. ‘There must be no private reserves on the wedding night, and each one must allow their soul to be as open as their arms.’ Other relationship-enhancing tips included the advice that passion is increased by time spent apart, and that even decent women should use a little rouge, enamel or powder, plus some ‘pencilling of the eyebrows and darkening stuff for the lids’. German vintage postcard from 1909, showing a loving couple kissing at piano - people of the Victorian era might have been a lot more 'sexually minded' than we previously thought . Those with small breasts were advised that a little judicious padding might not go amiss — with the proviso that if they began this deception with a suitor before marriage, they should be prepared for him to be disappointed on the wedding night. Like their 21st-century counterparts, Victorian commentators worried about the legalisation of the sex industry, the ethics and availability of contraception and the horrors of human trafficking and child prostitution. But, writes Riddell, if the 19th century abounded with attitudes that we can readily identify with, our forebears also espoused many ideas that now seem utterly alien. Among the most significant of these, she suggests, is the Victorian fear of the dangers involved with what they euphemistically called the practice of ‘the solitary vice’. The Swiss neurologist Samuel-Auguste Tissot had published his influential L’Onanisme in 1760, in which he suggested that the consequences of masturbation included insanity or even death. A commonly held belief during the Victorian era was that a woman could become pregnant only if she experienced an orgasm at the same time as her lover . More than 100 years later, Tissot’s theories were still widely believed, with the fear of ‘the solitary vice’ dominating Victorian marriage guides and advice on morals and manners. One well-known author on the subject was J. H. Kellogg, creator of the cornflake. Those tempted to indulge, it was suggested, should avoid mustard, pepper, rich gravy, beer, wine, cider and tobacco, all of which created a craving for sensual gratification. Rather than risk the consequences of ‘the solitary vice’, those in possession of 100 guineas could purchase a ‘femme de voyage’ or inflatable sex aid, for the ‘special use of gentlemen on their travels’. These ingenious contraptions could be packed up and stored under a gentleman’s hat, and were also ‘a highly successful alternative to those who fear contamination or pollution from illicit acts with questionable lovers’. Another commonly held and erroneous belief was the notion that a woman could become pregnant only if she experienced an orgasm at the same time as her lover. Without this, the female seed could not be released and no child would be formed in her womb. Furthermore, at the conclusion of the sexual act, the wife must not talk, cough or sneeze, lest this impede conception. Old texts said that those looking to have children should remember that 'sex must not be faintly or drowsily performed' In 1845, the French physician Eugene Becklard, in his book Physiological Mysteries And Revelations In Love, Courtship And Marriage: An Infallible Guide-book For Married And Single Persons, In Matters Of The Utmost Importance To The Human Race, took this argument to its supposed logical conclusion and argued that since the ‘fecundating principle’ would not enter the womb unless a woman craved it do so, ‘a rape can never be productive of real offspring’. He also propounded the view that ‘the party, whose temperament predominates in the child, was in the highest state of orgasm at the period of intercourse’. Crucially, any union without true love, according to the manuals of the day, would bring forth ‘ill-looking, sour and spiritless offspring’, while those hoping for good-looking children should remember that sex must not be ‘faintly or drowsily performed’. Intriguingly, though, babies conceived during the daytime often turned out both ‘fine and handsome’. Conversely, women were cautioned that ‘a child that was begat upon a set of stair is most likely to be born with a crooked back and given in no small way to the fault of staring’. And if the husband was unfaithful, children he sired were likely to be ‘weak and wretched’ and grow up unhappy. As if all this weren’t enough for the beleaguered Victorian matron to take in, further gems of advice unearthed by Riddell’s researches include the suggestion that children who were conceived in spring and summer could be expected to have darker complexions than those conceived in autumn and winter. Similarly, children ‘begat when the wind is blowing from the north’ would tend to be stronger than those conceived during an easterly wind. An illegitimate child, on the other hand, would be full of ‘fire and energy’. Despite popular depictions of 'subservient' women in the Victorian era, the century was full of strong, energetic women excelling in the fields of literary and scientific endeavour, or campaigning to improve conditions for their sex . This was evidence (albeit hypocritical in view of the Victorians’ moral code) of the passions which engulfed its parents at the time of conception. On the subject of choosing a partner, a wealth of advice — some of it downright bizarre — was available to young men and women of the period. No man, for example, should marry a woman with a nose similar to his own. Women with Roman, or hooked, noses should not marry at all — or else find a small-nosed husband. Not only this, but potential suitors should remember to check skin tone, body shape, chin, height and size of feet. A broad and square chin was thought to be indicative of a jealous nature, while a long chin proved grace and humility. Big-footed men and women, although awkward on first meeting, made the most reliable partners, while small-footed people were deemed prone to reckless gaiety. The plump were renowned for their affable and easy nature. Those with sharp and angular forms were energetic and earnest and prone to find fault with the indolence of others. Tall people were thought to have the most self-control, while short people were the opposite, hence their frequent appearance in riotous mobs. Gentlemen were advised that the easiest way to choose their future intended was to be guided by the shape of her legs. Sturdy legs with a neat ankle were thought the most suitable for a man who wanted an intellectual companion. Heavy legs and coarse shoes were regarded as indicative of a coarse nature, while thin yet muscular pins were best for a gentleman who wanted his home run with military precision. Once marriage was finally in prospect, couples were counselled to bear in mind that a warm climate made people feel sexier — an important factor when planning the honeymoon, or wedding tour. Later, however, when the stresses and strains of family life began to show, gentlemen were reminded by one author that ‘hysterical wives or children should be laid on a waterproof sheet on the floor and doused with a jug of cold water.’ The idea of such dominant men and submissive wives is, on the whole, suggests Riddell, not a representative one. In reality, she says, the century was full of strong, energetic women excelling in the fields of literary and scientific endeavour, or campaigning to improve conditions for their sex. While much of the advice given out at the time was misguided and inaccurate, the 19th-century tenets of true love, respect and mutual physical pleasure are, she believes, as relevant today as they were 150 years ago. And for their timeless and illuminating advice on how to conduct a successful sexual relationship — along with a wealth of architecture, engineering, art and literature — we have a lot to thank the Victorians for.

"When it comes to being determined, one particular Chinese student takes some beating.

Having checked out that she was not seriously injured, she reached into her bag for the electronic gizmo while still sprawled on the ground, and set about learning 107 new English words in the time it took for an ambulance to arrive to treat injuries to her legs, head and arms. Wang, a bright spark who has won lots of scholarships and academic prizes in her time, said: ‘I was in pain but the study kept my mind off feeling hurt. I think that we are all on this earth for such a short time that we owe it to our family, friends and each others to become the best that we can be and you can only do this if you are educated. ‘I found that studying the English words was a great help and soothed my pain.’ She is currently a student at Capital Normal University in Beijing and hopes to continue her studies at Oxford or Cambridge in the future and plans for a career in academia.","A Chinese road accident victim studied a dictionary as she waited for help .

"Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is making good on his promise to sue the Obama administration over what he calls 'precisely the kind of overreach we fought a revolution over.' His targets are the National Security Agency, the FBI and other federal government offices that snoop on private communications at home and abroad. With former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli as his lead attorney, Paul filed suit Wednesday morning in Washington, D.C. federal court along with the conservative FreedomWorks organization. 'There's a huge and growing swell of protest in this country,' Paul said during a Wednesday morning press conference, 'of people who are outraged that their records would be taken without suspicion, without a judge's warrant, and without individualization.' The legal action, officially titled 'Rand Paul v. Barack Obama,' hit the court running with at least 350,000 plaintiffs, according to a source close to the process. Paul is aiming for 10 million, judging from a message on two websites run by his political staff.

'Libertarian rock star': Rand Paul is solidifying his base through a class-action lawsuit aimed at cornering the political market on Libertarian objections to the NSA. He said in a video message to supporters that his lawsuit would ferret out the broad 'general warrants' over which the early American colonists fought the British crown . Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli couldn't capture the governor's mansion in November, but he's committed to the anti-NSA lawsuit, sources close to the legal process say . The lawsuit argues that the president 'has publicly refused to stop a clear and continuing violation of the Fourth Amendment,' Paul said in a statement from his political action committee. 'I expect this case to go all the way to the Supreme Court and I predict the American people will win.' Wednesday morning he insisted that 'ultimately,the Supreme Court will be [the] arbiter of what the Fourth Amendment means.' And he predicted that his lawsuit 'could conceivably represent hundreds of millions of people who have phone lines in this country.' President Obama is named as a defendant, along with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Director of the National Security Agency Gen. Keith Alexander, and FBI Director James Comey. In a statement, the Justice Department defended the NSA's broad data collection, saying that 'we remain confident that the program is legal, as at least 15 judges have previously found.' Caitlin Hayden, the White House National Security Council Staff spokesperson, told MailOnline that 'we believe the program as it exists is lawful.' The NSA program, Hayden said, 'receives oversight from all three branches of government, including the Congress. More generally, the president believes that we should to take steps to give the American people more confidence that their privacy and civil liberties are being safeguarded.' Sen. Paul, son of the former Texas congressman and frequent presidential candidate Ron Paul, is attracting attention with an unusual blend of Libertarian policy that hat-tips social conservatism at every turn . Gen. Keith Alexander leads the National Security Agency and routinely . justifies his agency's secritive work to members of Congress and federal . judges in clandestine meetings outside of public view . Obama said during a lengthy January 17 speech about U.S. signals intelligence gathering – an oration that might be a preview of the government's courtroom defense – that 'the men and women of the intelligence community, including the NSA, consistently follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people.' 'They're not abusing authorities in order to listen to your private phone calls or read your emails,' the president insisted. His press secretary, Jay Carney, followed up ten days later with assurance during a daily briefing that 'to the extent that the NSA collects information, it is focused on valid foreign intelligence targets and not the information of ordinary Americans.' 'Look,' he told reporters, 'I mean, terrorists, proliferators, other bad actors use the same communication tools that others use.' Other Democrats who are unsympathetic to Paul's position have been more crass about it. Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell told The Washington Times on Wednesday that the lawsuit just made him 'look like a petty politician.' 'Obviously the strategy is to appeal to the base,' Rendell said. 'Rand Paul obviously thinks he has a leg up now with [New Jersey] Gov. [Chris] Christie’s problems. He wants to show the base he’s a fighter, that’s what suing the president is all about.' But as Paul swings hard at Obama, other potential 2016 GOP contenders are softening on the NSA. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told the Tampa Bay Times on Wednesday that, 'Certainly we should need protect America’s privacy expectations and privacy rights, but we also need an effective surveillance capability.' He worried aloud about 'five different organizations that brand themselves as al-Qaeda who every single day plot to attack our interests and our allies and even the homeland. We need to have surveillance capabilities to identify them. And we need to be careful about weakening those.' Sen. Paul's objection focuses on the so-called bulk phone-record 'metadata' that the NSA gathers routinely. The data includes phone numbers, dates, times, and the durations of calls. National security analysts say the massive tranches of data can be helpful when terrorism suspects are identified, because they allow investigators to establish who they have been talking to – and when. Instigator: Edward Snowden, a former NSA contract employee, absconded with millions of records and leaked them to The Guardian newspaper, exposing secretive government snooping programs that Sen. Paul is suing to eliminate . Paul's legal advisers thought about filing suit in a Kentucky federal court, MailOnline's source said, but decided on Washington, D.C. because its judges are accustomed to sifting through the thorny issues surrounding whether a class-action group deserves to be 'certified'–if, that is, its members have standing to sue. He plans a press conference in front of the federal courthouse on Wednesday morning to boast that he's protecting the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment from the White House's national security apparatus. 'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,' that Amendment reads in part. The senator first forecast his legal action in late December, and told the Fox News Channel that since the Obama administration 'has used the IRS to go after people ... we wonder if they would use the NSA that way.' 'Everybody who has a cellphone would be eligible' to become a plaintiff, he said. That interview came on the same day the NSA convinced a top-secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act judge to green-light its metadata collection for a new 90-day period. That program, the subject of worldwide leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, has won reauthorization at least 36 times during the past seven years. Paul's odd mix of libertarian crusade and conservative button-pushing isn't new, and it might become the norm on the right as more Republicans try to find common ground between what amount to warring cousins. Scene of the crimes? This NSA  eavesdropping facility in the Appalachian mountains, code-named Timberline, is reportedly used for domestic and international surveillance, including intercepting private phone calls. It's inside the National Radio Quiet Zone, a 13,000 square mile area where wireless communications like radios, cell phones, and wi-fi are severely restricted . 'Libertarian, or liberty, doesn’t mean libertine,' the GOP presidential hopeful told a red-meat right-wing crowd at a D.C. gala last week. 'To many of us,' he said, playing deftly to a room full of social conservatives, 'Libertarian means freedom and liberty. But we also see freedom needs tradition.' Matt Kibbe, who leads the influential right-wing Freedomorks organization, is managing the list of plaintiffs for Sen. Paul. His group is also a co-plaintiff . The speech came an hour after a lobbyist was heard introducing him to friends during a pre-dinner reception as a 'Libertarian rock star.' But Paul cautioned that 'I don’t see libertarianism as, ""you can do whatever you want"".' Now the federal legislator is applying that message to the executive branch of government, and hoping the judicial branch will see things his way. But while his lawsuit percolates, Freedomworks president Matt Kibbe will manage the plaintiff-lists and turn them into a political mobilizing tool. 'If you use a phone, you should care about this case,' Kibbe said Tuesday, adding that his group's 6 million members stand behind the legal effort. Names are initially collected on websites run by PaulPAC, the Kentucky senator's Political Action Committee, and by his political campaign – presumably one now engaged in planning for the 2016 presidential race. Both websites ask Web surfers to 'sign below and join my class-action lawsuit and help stop the government's outrageous spying program on the American people.' They also ask for donations. 'After you sign up, please make a generous donation to help rally up to ten million Americans to support my lawsuit to stop Big Brother,' a message reads.","Kentucky senator wants to end broad, non-targeted surveillance of Americans' communications, including so-called 'metadata'

"A single mother on  benefits funded her family’s entire Christmas by taking out eight payday loans. Katie . McGill, 28, borrowed around £1,700 from companies including the . controversial Wonga so she could treat her two children to a . traditional meal and expensive presents. It meant Mya-Renee, three, . and Calvin, eight, were each able to unwrap a new bike, a new TV and a . DVD player, as well as numerous computer games. Payouts: Katie McGill, 28, wanted to 'treat' her children Mya-Renee, three, and Calvin, eight this Christmas . But now the . celebrations are over, their mother is saddled with more than £3,000 of . debt – with only her benefits to use to pay it back. Miss McGill, . from Devizes in Wiltshire, started borrowing in the months leading up to . Christmas to pay for this year’s festivities. She ended up taking out eight of the controversial loans – which critics say charge sky-high rates – from various lenders. Now, . she says the only way she will be able to pay them back is by using the . £140 of her fortnightly benefits that doesn’t already leave her account . through direct debits for various expenses. Miss McGill said: ‘Each . time I’ve borrowed money I’ve started borrowing more and more and now I . have ended up with £3,000 worth of debt. 'I started thinking about . Christmas a couple of months ago and thought that the only way I’d be . able to get my kids the presents they wanted was by borrowing the money. ‘There were hundreds of presents under the tree. Their gran passed away this year so it was nice to be able to treat them.’ The . single mother has now criticised Wonga and the other firms for giving . her the loans without properly looking into her circumstances. She said: . ‘It’s stupid really because I’m on benefits and there is no way I can . afford to pay it all back.’ Miss McGill said that when she first . started using payday lenders, back in 2009, she was in a stable . relationship and she and her partner both had jobs. This meant she was . able to pay off the loans. ‘But now I am on my own and unemployed,’ she said. ‘Wonga haven’t looked into my change of circumstances though, . and they’re still allowing me to borrow.’ Miss McGill – who has taken . out pre-Christmas loans ranging from £80 to £380 – will need to start . paying them back next Thursday.

But she says she won’t be able to afford it and fears she will simply end up borrowing more. ‘When .

Then I’ll start taking out more loans and . it will just be one big, messy, circle.’ A spokesman for Wonga said . the company does not let people take out more than one loan at once.

"Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday promised ‘intense and sustained’ U.S. support for Iraq, but said the divided country would only survive if its leaders took urgent steps to bring it together. Hours before Kerry arrived in Baghdad, Sunni tribes who have joined a militant takeover of northern Iraq seized the only legal crossing point with Jordan, security sources said, leaving troops with no presence along the entire western frontier which includes some of the Middle East's most important trade routes. U.S. President Barack Obama has offered up to 300 American advisers to Iraq but held off granting a request by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shi'ite Muslim-led government for air strikes to counter the two-week advance by Sunni militants. Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday promised 'intense and sustained' U.S. support for Iraq, but said the divided country would only survive if its leaders took urgent steps to bring it together . Oceans apart: Secretary of State John Kerry and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki met face to face in Baghdad on Monday. The two government officials didn't appear to be on very friendly terms at a photo-op, but Kerry said the 100 minute meeting went well . Officials have meanwhile called for Iraqis to form an inclusive government. The insurgency has been fuelled largely by a sense of materialization and persecution among Iraq's Sunnis. ‘The support will be intense and sustained and if Iraq's leaders take the necessary steps to bring the country together, it will be effective,’ Kerry told reporters in Baghdad. He said Maliki had ‘on multiple occasions affirmed his commitment to July 1’ as the date to start the formation of a new government bringing in more Sunnis and Kurds to share power, a move Washington is keen to see. Iraqi and Jordanian security sources said tribal leaders were negotiating to hand the Turabil desert border post to Sunni Islamists from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) who took two main crossings with Syria in recent days and have pushed Iraqi government forces back toward Baghdad. Kerry, center left, flew to Baghdad this morning to meet with Maliki, right, and Iraq's other leaders to personally urge the Shiite-led government to give more power to political opponents before a Sunni insurgency seizes more control across the country and sweeps away hopes for lasting peace . Iraq state television said late on Monday that the army had recaptured both the crossing with Jordan and the al-Waleed crossing with Syria. Ethnic Kurdish forces control a third border post with Syria in the north, leaving government troops with no presence along Iraq's 800-km western border. For the insurgents, capturing the frontier is a dramatic step towards the goal of erasing the modern border altogether and building a caliphate across swaths of Syria and Iraq. Kerry said: ‘Iraq faces an existential threat and Iraq's leaders have to beat that threat with the incredible urgency that it demands. The very future of Iraq depends on choices that will be made in the next days and weeks.’ Washington, which withdrew its troops from Iraq in 2011 after an occupation that followed the 2003 invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, has been struggling to help Maliki's administration contain a Sunni insurgency led by ISIL, an al Qaeda offshoot which seized northern cities this month. The U.S. can't go in and occupy every country in the Middle East facing turmoil, president Obama said in a series of interviews that aired on Monday morning . ¿Unless we are prepared to stay indefinitely in all these various countries, something that we can¿t afford, and it would involve over time accusations that we were occupying these countries,¿ Obama told Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski, ¿at some stage, they¿re gonna have to take responsibility for working together' Washington is worried Maliki and fellow Shi'ites who have won U.S.-backed elections have worsened the insurgency by alienating moderate Sunnis who once fought al Qaeda but have now joined the ISIL revolt. While Washington has been careful not to say publicly it wants Maliki to step aside, Iraqi officials say such a message was delivered behind the scenes. There was little small talk when Kerry met Maliki, the two men seated in chairs in a room with other officials. The meeting lasted one hour and 40 minutes, after which Kerry was escorted to his car by Iraq's Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari. As Kerry got in, he said: 'That was good.' The face to face meeting followed the broadcast of an interview with President Obama in which had reiterated that the United States cannot solve Iraq's problems with military force.

A general view from a helicopter carrying Secretary of State John Kerry, shows Baghdad, Iraq as of this morning. Islamic extremists have still been unable to get close to the country's capitol city despite destroying neighboring towns . Only Iraqis can resolve the violent conflict tearing apart in their country, Obama said, and in order to do accomplish this, they must find a way to ignore their sectarian differences for the common good of their homeland. 'If they can't, there's not gonna . be a military solution to this problem, Obama told CNN's Kate Boulduan. 'There's no amount of American . fire power that's gonna be able to hold the country together, and I've . made that clear to [Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki] and all the other leadership inside of . Iraq.' The U.S. neither has the resources nor the responsibility to be the world police in the Middle East, President Barack Obama emphasized. ‘Unless . we are prepared to stay indefinitely in all these various countries, . something that we can’t afford, and it would involve over time . accusations that we were occupying these countries,’ Obama told Morning Joe . co-host Mika Brzezinski,‘at . some stage, they’re gonna have to take responsibility for working . together.’ Iraq is the third stop on Kerry's trip to the Middle East. The Secretary of State, center, his staff and bodyguards are pictured here boarding a plane in Jordan this morning . Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, second right, greets Kerry, left, upon his arrival to Baghdad . Kerry's meeting in Baghdad today comes after an announcement by President Barack Obama on Thursday that the U.S. would send up to 300 military advisers to Iraq but no combat troops . America's military cannot run around the world playing 'whack-a-mole' with extremist . groups, the president has repeatedly said throughout the last several . days. ‘Keep in mind that our goal in . Afghanistan was to decapitate Al Qaeda, which had carried out 9/11. That . has been accomplished. Now Afghanistan is a sovereign country that is . gonna have to deal with its own security,’ Last month the president announced that he would significantly draw down troops in Afghanistan by the end of the year. The president has made clear that he would not put boots back on the ground in Iraq. On Thursday Obama announced that the U.S. would deploy up to 300 military advisers . to help train, advise and support the Iraqi army but made clear that . the forces would not engage in combat with the Islamic radicals . violently attempting to conquer the country. A CBS News/New York Times poll released on Monday found that Americans are divided about how they want the president to handle the situation. Half of Americans believe that U.S. does not have a responsibility to provide military assistance to the ailing country, while 42 percent said the U.S. was obligated to intervene. Likewise, 50 percent poll-takers said they believe the ongoing situation in Iraq will not increase the threat of terrorism in the United States, compared to the 44 percent who thought it would.

"A woman who has dedicated her life to transforming herself into Barbie is taking her obsession with becoming a doll to extreme lengths - by having hypnotherapy to make her 'brainless'. Blondie Bennett, 38, from California, has sessions once a week to make her more easily confused and vacant. The former model, who changed her name to Blondie a year and a half ago, has also spent £25,000 on five breast enlargements taking her to a size 32JJ. Scroll down for video .

Blondie regularly has spray tans, Botox and lip fillers to give her a more artificial appearance. But to make the transformation into the plastic toy complete, she is actively trying to become more stupid. She said: 'When people ask why I want to be Barbie I think ""who wouldn't want to be?"" 'She has the best life. All she does is shop and make herself look pretty - she doesn't worry about anything. 'I've had 20 session and I'm already starting to feel ditzy and confused all the time. 'Recently I went to pick a friend up at the airport and couldn't remember if I needed to go to departures or arrivals. I also got lost for three hours driving to my mum's house - the house where I grew up.' Blondie Bennett, pictured left and right aged 18; in her teens she dressed like Barbie, bleached her hair and even had drove a Corvette like her hero . Blondie says her obsession with Barbie began at a young age, when she played with the children's favourite. In her teens she dressed like Barbie, bleached her hair and even had drove a Corvette like her hero. Then, at 18, she began to take on promotional jobs at toy stores pretending to be Barbie. Blondie said: 'People thought it was just a phase but I thought to myself as soon as I move out of home I'm going to turn myself into Barbie. 'My friends hated the attention I got from guys because of how I dressed. The told me to tone it down when I went out with them. 'I was forced to live a double life until about eight years ago when I decided to become Barbie for real and ignore what other people said.' Last August, Blondie had her H cup implants increased to a JJ with 1700cc saline implants. And in December she had chin liposuction to contour her face so she looked more like Barbie.

"A secret cache of Colonel Gaddafi’s chemical weapons has been found in Libya, the country’s new rulers announced yesterday. The deadly arsenal proves the tyrant had refused to give up his weapons of mass destruction – despite promising Tony Blair he would relinquish them in the infamous ‘Deal in the Desert’. The National Transitional Council said the chemical warheads had been secured and would be made safe by experts. Under examination: One of Gaddafi's deadly missiles that was hidden in one of 80 ammunition bunkers just south of Sirte . A spokesman said: ‘They are from the Gaddafi era and are under guard until they can be handed over.’ To this day, Mr Blair defends his decision to embrace Gaddafi by trumpeting the idea that he forced the dictator to give up his WMD programme. His spokesman said earlier this week: ‘Mr Blair, in office, had been responsible for getting Gaddafi to give up his chemical and nuclear weapons programme and renounce terrorism.’ Gaddafi agreed to destroy most of his weapons of mass destruction in 2003 as part of moves to bring Libya, then a pariah state, in from the cold. The agreement was sealed in 2004 when Mr Blair shook hands with Gaddafi in a tent outside Tripoli. The disarming process was being overseen by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, but was never finished because of the outbreak of war. Warheads: Gaddafi had stored piles of ammunition and stored them wherever he could . It meant the dictator retained around ten tons of deadly mustard gas and other chemicals. Throughout the uprising, rebels feared vengeful Gaddafi – who warned they faced the ‘fires from Hell’ – would unleash WMD on his own people. In Misrata, panic gripped the population when forces loyal to Gaddafi were seen wearing gas masks.Nato spy planes and satellites monitored suspected chemical weapons dumps at three separate locations, including the Rughawa site some 130 miles south of the tyrant’s birthplace Sirte. Nato is still flying sorties over Libya, mainly in an effort to hunt down Gaddafi’s London-educated playboy son Saif, last seen making a dash for the desert border with Niger. Libya’s new leaders yesterday begged Nato to continue with the mission. Frightening: Rockets are . ready to be used to kill and maim, but they will now be destroyed . Mustafa Abdul Jalil, chairman of the National Transitional Council, said he wanted Nato help until ‘the end of the year’ in stopping Gaddafi loyalists fleeing justice. But at the Brussels headquarters of the alliance, Nato officials recalled their UN mandate was to protect civilians, not target individuals. A meeting of Nato ambassadors was postponed from yesterday until tomorrow to allow for further discussion, but is still expected to endorse a decision to halt the Libya mission on October 31. Meanwhile former Libyan foreign minister Musa Kusa – who defected to Britain – issued a fierce denial yesterday that he had any ‘involvement of any kind or knowledge’ of the Lockerbie bombing and the murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher. Danger: A missile in a wooden crate is seen in an ammunition storage bunker some 100kms south of Sirte . Kusa issued a statement through legal representatives in London following allegations made on the BBC’s Panorama programme. The programme, broadcast on Monday, claimed he personally tortured prisoners and was involved in the 1996 massacre of more than 1,200 inmates at the country’s notorious Abu Salim prison. Broken: Colonel Gaddafi had promised Tony Blair that he had got rid of his weapons of mass destruction, but this has proved he did not . Kusa, who made a high-profile defection to Britain in March as Colonel Gaddafi’s regime crumbled, accused programme-makers of making ‘false allegations’, claiming: ‘I have never tortured anyone nor been involved in torture. Neither was I present at the massacre at Abu Salim prison.’ He added: ‘I also had no involvement of any kind or knowledge of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 or the murder of WPC Fletcher in 1984. ‘I have voluntarily assisted the relevant investigatory authorities with their inquiries in relation to these matters.’ Kusa is now in Qatar, having been permitted to leave Britain, following an EU decision to lift sanctions against him. He was head of Colonel Gaddafi’s intelligence agency from 1994 and was reported to be a senior intelligence agent when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie, killing 270 people.","The tyrant made the 'Deal in the Desert' and promised to get rid of his WMDs .

"A man who was the sole survivor of a massacre at his family's home had actually plotted the murders with a family friend - before killing him and fingering him as the killer, prosecutors have said. Ryan Champion, 36, was indicted in Trigg County, Kentucky on Wednesday for the murder of Vito Riservato, 22, and on three counts of complicity to commit murder for the deaths of his parents and sister. The bodies of his parents, Lindsey Champion, 62, and Joy Champion, 60, and his 31-year-old veterinarian sister Emily Champion were found last month at the family's rural home in Cadiz. Riservato's body was also found in the home, and all four died of gunshot wounds. 'Killers': Ryan Champion, left, has been indicted for the murder of Vito Riservato, right, who he said he shot after Riservato killed his family. Prosecutors have now claimed he had hired the man for the murders . Gunned down: Ryan Champion is pictured left with his family - (from left) sister Emily, mother Joy and father Lindsey, who were all found shot dead on the family's farm in Kentucky in October . After Ryan Champion was released from hospital following the killings, he told WSMV-TV that Riservato entered the home and started shooting but that he 'was able to turn the tables' on him. 'He got close enough to me that I could turn the tables, and that was it,' he claimed. 'Every minute the entire thing was going on, that's all I was waiting for. I was waiting for an opportunity.' But prosecutors said on Wednesday that was not what happened - and Champion had actually enlisted Riservato's help and then killed him. Commonwealth's Attorney G.L. Ovey, the top prosecutor in Trigg County, said it started out as a murder-for-hire scheme, but 'it didn't end up that way'. 'In a murder for hire, he would've got paid, but... he was murdered,' Ovey said. Questions: Ryan Champion can be seen here speaking to police at the scene of the murders last month . 'In shock': In an interview after he was released from hospital, pictured, Champion said he had managed to 'turn the tables' on Riservato as he shot dead his family before killing the man . Ovey, who said he will seek the death penalty for Champion, would not speculate on what Ryan Champion's motives were in the deaths of his parents. He worked as a contractor in town and had recently been evicted from his apartment. Hours after the four bodies were found spread across the Champions' horse farm on October 26, police named Riservato as the suspect. But his friends and family said that the young father could never have been responsible for the horrific crimes. 'Anyone who knew Vito knows he's not a killer,' his ex-girlfriend Bekah Kuser said on Facebook. 'He was a loving father and a good friend. 'I don't want his name to be tarnished just because someone can't own up to what they have done, its so sad how someone has to pin it on someone who is no longer with us.' In his TV interview, Ryan Champion claimed he was spared because the killer did not see him as a threat. He declined to elaborate further on the killings, citing the ongoing police investigation. He also told media outlets that he had only met Riservato once before the killings, and posted updates on Facebook after the slayings, saying he had survived and was recuperating. Loving: Emily Champion, a veterinarian, was just visiting her parents for a few days when she was shot dead . Location: The killings unfolded at the family's farm in the rural town of Cadiz, Kentucky on October 26 . Champion later posted that he was in need of money and looking for odd jobs to pay for bills and gas after the tragedy. Emily Champion was in Cadiz for a short visit, and a kidnapping charge against Ryan Champion pertains to her. Ovey said she was restrained by duct tape during the attack. She was a veterinarian at Baronne Veterinary Clinic in Sunset, Louisiana. She had been visiting her parents in Kentucky during time off after getting a new job. She graduated from Auburn University's college of veterinary medicine in 2008 and practiced at Delta Downs racetrack in Vinton, Louisiana. Joy Champion was a retired teacher who taught for 30 years at schools in Trigg County. Champion is due back in court for an arraignment on December 10. He is being held in the Christian County Jail on a $5 million bond.","Ryan Champion had claimed in TV interviews that he shot Vito Riservato, 22, after he saw the man killing his parents and sister last month .

"The victims of a horrific crash in Lodi, California, Tuesday evening have been identified as a father and his three children between the ages of 4 and 11, as well as a pregnant woman. The multicar smash-up that happened just after 5.20pm at a busy intersection took the lives of Irving Miranda, 11; his 5-year-old brother Jose; their 4-year-old sister Stephanie, and the siblings' father, 30-year-old Luis Miranda. Also killed in the crash was 31-year-old Vivian Rodriguez and her unborn baby. Scroll down for video .

"A massive python has been caught on camera swallowing a baby antelope whole. The impressive digestive feat was captured by Indian animal rescuer Nitish Bambhaniya in the tiny village of Billa in the Indian state of Gujarat.

"Two weeks ago, Queen Maxima of the Netherlands sat politely through a talk on high tech toilets while visiting Japan. Today, she was back on the factory floor as she toured a cheese co-operative close to Utrecht and opened Cono Cheesemaker's new building. But although she had competition from a teetering stack of Beemster cheese wheels, all eyes were on the royal, who was glamorous in an all-gold ensemble. Tasty: Queen Maxima dressed up in gold for the opening of a new cheese factory in Utrecht . Glamorous: The Argentina-born mother-of-three has won plaudits for her stellar sense of style . Ever the professional, the Argentina-born Queen, 43, got involved in proceedings, helping factory bosses slice through a huge wheel of orange cheese - much to their delight. The visit to Utrecht was a light-hearted end to a week that began with an emotional memorial service dedicated to the victims of the MH17 disaster. During the event, Maxima, who was famously photographed wiping away tears as the first repatriation flight arrived in Eindhoven, and husband King Willem-Alexander heard the names of all 298 victims read out. Two thirds of the dead were Dutch but British, Australians, Malaysians and Germans also perished when the Malaysia Airways flight to Kuala Lumpur was shot down.

What if the plane had been late? What if I wake up and realise it was all just a dream?' Although Ukrainian separatists are thought to be responsible for shooting down the plane, investigations - and repatriation flights - continue. Since the crash in July, Maxima's popularity has soared - partly as a result of her obvious sympathy and continuing support for victims' families. She has also won plaudits for her glamorous sense of style, showcased, most recently, during a state visit to Japan and South Korea.","The Dutch Queen, 43, was glamorous in gold at a Utrecht cheese factory .

"With one of Britain’s biggest music festivals coming up this weekend, one supermarket has clearly worked out that revellers are more likely to want Fosters and vodka instead of fruit and vegetables. These were the scenes at a Tesco store in Reading, Berkshire, ahead of the Reading music festival this weekend which features the likes of Arctic Monkeys, Blink-182 and Queens of the Stone Age. Shelves at the Reading West store - which is a 15-minute walk away from the entrance to the festival site - were packed with Jägermeister and Strongbow, as well as more practical supplies such as tents.

"A Japanese passenger plead guilty Friday to assaulting a flight attendant while in a drunken stupor on a flight from Osaka, Japan, to Honolulu, Hawaii. The passenger, Kenji Okamoto, 30, plead guilty in federal court to interfering with the duties of a flight attendant by assaulting and intimidating him. According to a criminal complaint, Okamoto, who is from Kyoto, was flying first-class on a Delta Air Lines flight from . Osaka for his honeymoon last month when flight attendants noticed he was . drunk before takeoff. Drunken passenger Kenji Okamoto, 30, was arrested after assaulting a flight attendant during a transpacific flight. Okamoto had been drinking in celebration of recent marriage and upcoming honeymoon . Okamoto told authorities later that before . boarding the plane, he had four glasses of beer and one glass of wine. He continued drinking champagne and wine upon boarding the plane. On the flight, Okamoto got upset when one of the flight attendants wouldn't take his . meal tray away. This caused Okamoto to allegedly throw 'a roundhouse type punch' at another flight attendant who intervened in an attempt to diffuse the . situation. Okamoto struck the flight attendant in his arms, which were raised to protect his head, according to the complaint. After being restrained by crew members, Okamoto apologized while crying, remained calm for the remainder of the flight . and eventually fell asleep. 'Okamoto apologized for . his actions by repeatedly saying 'I'm sorry' and bowed down on his knees . and placed his head on the floor,' the complaint said. During an interview with authorities, Okamoto said he's in the . construction business and was 'drinking heavily because he was . celebrating his honeymoon with his wife ... that he married on April 20, . 2014.' The Federal Detention Center, in Honolulu, Hawaii. Okamoto was denied bond after being arrested due to lying about previous criminal convictions he had gotten in Japan . The incident happened ""like a flash,"" said Okamoto. He claimed not to remember what exactly happened but that he . was upset because he felt like he was being disrespected when the first . flight attendant wouldn't take his tray away. U.S. Magistrate Kevin Chang initially allowed Okamoto to . be released on $50,000 bond, but Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy Hino . appealed, arguing that Okamoto didn't disclose a previous conviction in . Japan for assaulting a police officer. Hino's appeal provided photos of . the Okamoto's near full-body tattoos, arguing that Okamoto is a flight . risk and a danger. Delta banned Okamoto from flying on the airline, according to Hino's appeal. U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright granted the appeal to keep him . held without bail at the Honolulu Federal Detention Center. Because he was arrested at the airport, he never got to enjoy his . honeymoon, which was to be spent at a luxury resort in east Honolulu, . Hino said. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison when he's sentenced on Sept. 22.","Kenji Okamoto, 30, was arrested after attacking flight attendant in a drunken rage .

"Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday the United States is setting up a $5billion 'terrorism partnership fund' to help other countries push back against radical extremists. Appearing on a host of network morning-show interviews, Kerry staunchly defended President Barack Obama's decision to terminate the U.S. combat role in Afghanistan by the end of the year. Referring in a 'Today' show interview to a speech Obama was set to give later Wednesday at the U.S. Military Academy, Kerry said Obama is telling the Afghans 'by a specific time they have to take over management of their own security and military.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Making the rounds: Secretary of State John Kerry appeared on NBC's Today Show (pictured) as well as the morning programs on CBS, ABC and CNN to announce the new anti-terrorism initiative . Kerry said the message to Afghanistan is 'we're not going to give you all the time in the world. You have to push the envelope.' 'This is not an abandonment of Afghanistan,' Kerry said. 'This is an emboldenment. This is an empowerment of Afghanistan.' Appearing on 'CBS This Morning,' he said the withdrawal plan of the U.S. will allow this country to divert resources to the anti-terrorism fight in other parts of the world. Kerry said U.S. foreign policy needs to reflect a 'rapidly changing, more complex world where terrorism is the principal challenge.' Kerry called the Afghanistan troop withdrawal announcement 'a statement of transition' and said that 'if you tell the Afghans we'll be here as long as it takes, you can absolutely bet your bottom dollar they'll take as long as they want.' Heading out: President Obama, seen leaving the White House Wednesday morning, is due to give a speech at the West Point military academy . The secretary also said 'it is exactly what the American people have always sought in Afghanistan' and said 'the Afghans want us to transition out.' During his interview on ABC's 'Good Morning America,' Kerry was asked for an update on U.S. efforts to win the release of nearly 300 schoolgirls abducted by Islamic extremists in Nigeria. 'We have people on the ground and we're working hand in hand with Nigerians,' he replied. Kerry also talked about National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden on Wednesday, calling him a fugitive who should 'man up and come back to the United States.' Kerry was asked on the Today show about an interview Snowden recently gave in which he said he never intended to be holed up in Russia but was forced to go there because Washington decided to 'revoke my passport.' Asked about Snowden's comments, Kerry replied: 'Well, for a supposedly smart guy, that's a pretty dumb answer, after all.' Sit down: Kerry said that Edward Snowden, whose interview with Brian Williams will air in full tonight, should 'man up and come back to the United States' 'If Mr. Snowden wants to come back to the United States, we'll have him on a flight today.' Kerry said Snowden should 'stand up in the United States and make his case to the American people.' In his interview with NBC anchor Brian Williams, a portion of which was broadcast Tuesday, Snowden said he was 'trained as a spy' and argued that he had a much larger role in U.S. intelligence than the government has acknowledged. 'I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word, in that I lived and worked undercover overseas,' he said. Kerry said, 'A patriot would not run away. ... He can come home but he's a fugitive from justice.' 'Let him come back and make his case,' the secretary added. 'If he cares so much about America and he believes in America, he should trust the American system of justice.' 'I think he's confused,' Kerry added. 'I think it's very sad. But this is a man who has done great damage to his country.'

"Nick Clegg ‘put his fingers in his ears’ when told his free school meals policy was in chaos, it was claimed last night. The Deputy Prime Minister is accused of ignoring Whitehall warnings that the £1billion plan was a ‘dumb gimmick’. Dominic Cummings – a former adviser to Education Secretary Michael Gove – said officials were given only one hour’s notice of the policy announcement. Fingers in his ears: The Deputy PM was accused last night of ignoring signs a key policy was in chaos . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and wife Miriam launched the free school diners policy at Lairdslands Primary School near Glasgow last year, but critics say it is an uncosted gimmick . On Monday, headteachers savaged the schools meal plan – for pupils aged four to seven – saying they did not have the facilities to cope with an extra 1.5million lunches. Mr Cummings said the Department for Education had dismissed the policy but Mr Clegg struck a deal with David Cameron to be allowed to push it through in return for the Tories announcing marriage tax breaks. Dominic Cummings, former adviser to Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove, condemns the idea . ‘Officials in the DfE were unanimous that it was a bad gimmick and . introduced in a way that makes it hard to avoid implementation chaos. Officials were obviously right,’ Mr Cummings said. He described the . £150million funding announcement for new kitchens as a . ‘back-of-the-fag-packet’ calculation from Mr Clegg’s spin doctors. He . added: ‘Because Clegg only thinks about politics ... he assumed that . our opposition was because it was a Clegg idea. It wasn’t. ‘Our . opposition was because it is a dumb idea, badly executed, which shows . why politicians should have less power over schools.’ He had earlier tweeted: ‘Officials warned Clegg/Downing St and told them the £150million is junk but fingers in ears.’ Jonathan . Isaby of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘There’s no such thing as a free . lunch and Nick Clegg’s dog’s dinner of a policy is proof of that. ‘Taxpayers . are footing the bill for a policy that was about winning applause at . conference rather than helping children or families struggling with the . cost of living.’ Mr Laws dismissed the claims from Mr Cummings, . saying: ‘What he said about the . Ex-Tory adviser Dominic Cummings . backdrop to the introduction of this . policy is complete and utter balls. The DfE was not opposed to this . policy, it was the result of pilots undertaken since 2009. ‘This . stuff from Dom reflects his personal views, it doesn’t reflect the views . of the Secretary of State, who I have spoken to extensively about this, . including before our policy announcement.’ Mr Clegg weighed in with . an article on the Lib Dem website, writing: ‘I would love the Liberal . Democrats to be able to take all the credit, but the truth is that . Whitehall has been looking at this for the last five years. ‘This isn’t back of the fag packet stuff. The evidence shows that free school meals make a real difference in our classrooms.’ But . Labour said Mr Cummings’s claims amounted to ‘very serious allegations . which call into question the quality of decision-making in the . Department for Education and in the Coalition as a whole’. Heads . criticised new guidance that urges schools to ask pupils to choose their . menu options at least two hours before they eat and operate staggered . lunch breaks which could mean some youngsters eating as early as 11am. Kevin Baskill, head of Christchurch Primary in Ilford, Essex, expressed his doubts about the policy yesterday. Schools minister David Laws, pictured with Mr Clegg, dismissed the criticism from Tory Dominic Cummings as 'utter balls' ‘It’s a fantastic idea, but not very well thought out. It’s a pity they didn’t sort out the details and then announce it,’ he said. ‘What we’ve discovered is that we’ll end up with a scenario where every day is rather like a Christmas lunch. ‘I wanted a second canteen so 150 four-year-olds could have a nice pleasant experience at lunchtime. Now, I suspect, that will become a very busy canteen. ‘I know money has gone to local authorities that will be passed through to schools, but I’m not sure it will meet the huge demand.’ Peter Malcolm, head of Rayleigh Primary in Essex, said the school needed extra kitchen equipment. ‘We don’t know if we will get the funding yet, so we don’t know if we can even cook the food yet,’ he added. ‘It’s very difficult to make a plan, if you don’t know what you can afford to do,’ he said. The free meals policy will save even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child.","From September children aged four to seven will qualify for free lunches .

"Conservative Australian Senator Jacqui Lambie has been told to 'get a life' after she echoed a controversial government senator's call for the burqa to be banned. The Tasmanian former soldier told SBS she completely agreed with Senator Cory Bernardi's opposition to the full-length garb worn by some Islamic women.

Scroll down for video . 'Ban the burqa': Senator Lambie shared this post on her public Facebook page on Thursday night . The broadcaster quoted Ms Lambie saying: 'I agree whole-heartedly with Senator Cory Bernadi’s comments - and call for an immediate and complete ban on the wearing of burqas in public. 'People can do want the want in the privacy of their own homes – but for the public safety of our children and families – remove the burqa.' Controversial words: Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie. Spray: Senator Lambie last week said people who believe in sharia law should 'get out' of Australia. Prominent Islamic community spokesman Keysar Trad told Daily Mail Australia Ms Lambie was 'jumping on the phobia bandwagon'. 'I think she should get out more,' Mr Trad said. 'She really seems to me like a misinformed person and should learn a bit more about her fellow Australians.' After the largest counter-terrorism operation in the country's history on Thursday, South Australian Liberal Senator Bernardi tweeted: 'Note burqa wearers in some of the houses raided this morning? This shroud of oppression and flag of fundamentalism is not right in Aust'. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who himself has said in the past he found the burqa 'confronting', distanced himself from Mr Bernardi's remarks. 'We shouldn't fret about people's faith. We shouldn't fret about what people wear. We should guard against crime. We should protect ourselves against potential terror,' he told reporters. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was scathing about Mr Bernardi's burqa comments. 'Why on earth is this out-of-touch, out-of-line Senator on a rampage with his ignorant and stupid comments?' he said at a press conference in Canberra.

"Primary school children have been told to wear only socks for lessons after shoes were banned in an attempt to improve children's results. Holmbush Primary School in Shoreham, West Sussex, declared that children should study barefoot after the school's 'Learning Council', made up of Year Six pupils, found that 'shoeless classrooms' could help pupils learn. After a trial, which was deemed successful by children and staff, the 240-pupil school's governors agreed to make the policy official, and Holmbush became a 'shoeless school' in January this year. Socks: Holmbush Primary School in Shoreham, East Sussex, adopted 'shoeless classroom' policy in January . The unusual philosophy, which originated in Scandinavia, where shoes bring in slush, snow and ice, suggests that children both learn and behave better when their feet are unrestricted by shoes. Pupils are said to be gentler with each other, concentrate better, and other benefits include cleaner and more hygienic carpets. Pupils at Holmbush, which is deemed 'good' by Ofsted, are allowed to go barefoot or to wear socks and slippers whenever they are in the school building, and only put on school shoes when they head outdoors to play. Headmistress Rebecca Jackson said: 'Shoeless classrooms were brought in to improve the learning environment.' However children and staff discovered one downside of shoeless learning last week when a fire alarm sounded and the children had to file out onto the wet playground in their socks. Some parents and carers were upset that the children got their feet wet as a result, with one grandmother of a five-year-old at the school saying: 'It’s absolutely ridiculous. 'Thee pupils were ushered out of the door without their shoes, and my grandson was stood there on a soaking wet playground in just his socks. Shoeless learning originated in Scandinavia, and is said to promote better learning and behaviour (file pic) 'When they came back into the school, they had to take their socks off, so when we went to collect the kids nearly all of them came out wearing shoes and no socks.' She added: 'It is just disgusting. There are so many health hazards about kids walking about in socks on the wooden floors and chair legs slamming on their feet, but the reassurance we’ve been given is that posters are no longer stuck on walls with drawing pins. 'Even in hospitals you’re not allowed to walk about barefoot because of health and safety implications.' Headteacher Rebecca Jackson said: 'The children’s safety is of the utmost importance, which is why we evacuated the building. 'During the afternoon, children with wet socks or tights were given spare dry ones and theirs were dried.' She added: 'Shoeless classrooms have nothing to do with [protecting] the carpet tiles - we haven’t had any new carpets fitted since 2007.'","Holmbush Primary School adopted 'shoeless classroom' policy in January .

"Ex-Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling - whose video game company took a spectacular dive into bankruptcy last year - is selling the blood-stained sock he wore during the 2004 World Series. Chris Ivy, director of sports for Texas-based Heritage Auctions, says online bidding begins around February 4. Live bidding will take place February 23. Blood money: Curt Schilling's bloody sock, shown here during the 2004 World Series, is expected to fetch as much as $600,000 . The sock previously had been on loan to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. It has been at Heritage's Dallas headquarters for several weeks and will be displayed at the auction house's Manhattan office before it is sold, according to Ivy. He said the sock is expected to fetch at least $100,000, though he described that as a conservative estimate. 'I do expect the bidding to be very spirited,' Ivy said. Schilling's company, 38 Studios, was lured to Providence, Rhode Island, from Massachusetts with a $75million loan guarantee in 2010. Spectacle: The bloody sock was previously on display, along with the cleats that Schilling wore during the World Series game, at the National Baseball Hall of Fame . In May, it laid off all its employees and it filed for bankruptcy in June. The state is now likely responsible for some $100million related to the deal, including interest. Schilling also had personally guaranteed loans to the company and listed the sock as bank collateral in a September filing with the Massachusetts secretary of state's office. Messages left for his publicist were not immediately returned. The bloody sock is one of two that sent Schilling into the annals of baseball lore in 2004. The other was from Game 6 of the American League Championship Series, when Schilling pitched against the New York Yankees with an injured ankle. Fall: Schilling is believed to have lost $50million that he had invested into video game company 38 Studios, which filed for bankruptcy last year . That sock is said to have been discarded in the trash at Yankees Stadium. The one being sold is from the second game of the World Series, which the Red Sox won that year for the first time in 86 years. Schilling has said he invested as much as $50million in 38 Studios and has lost all his baseball earnings. He told WEEI-AM in Boston last year that possibly having to sell the sock was part of 'having to pay for your mistakes.' 'I'm obligated to try and make amends and, unfortunately, this is one of the byproducts of that,' he told the station. Brad Horn, a spokesman for the hall of fame in Cooperstown, New York, said the loaned sock was returned in December under the terms of the hall's agreement with Schilling. Payment: Last year, Schilling told a radio station that he would possibly sell the sock as a part of 'having to pay for your mistakes' The hall had had it since 2004. The February 23 live bidding will be held at the Fletcher-Sinclair mansion in New York City, now home to the Ukrainian Institute of America. The auction will feature other 'five- and six-figure items,' including a jersey and cap worn by New York Yankees great Lou Gehrig, Ivy said. Heritage last May auctioned off the so-called 'Bill Buckner ball,' which rolled through the legs of the Red Sox first baseman in the 1986 World Series. Ivy said that item, like Schilling's sock, was listed at the time as being expected to bring in '$100,000-plus,' but it was sold to an anonymous bidder for $418,000.","Sock was worn by the former pitcher during a 2004 World Series game against the St Louis Cardinals .

"Patients who have had a ‘fair innings’ could be denied life-saving drugs under  proposed health reforms. The plans would mean experts taking into account whether there  is a ‘wider societal benefit’ to giving a patient crucial medicines. The NHS rationing body, Nice, fears the Department of Health proposals could see younger people deemed a higher priority for drug treatments because they have more years ahead of them – potentially contributing more to the economy – than the elderly. Controversial: The NHS rationing body, Nice, fears the Department of Health proposals could see younger people deemed a higher priority for drug treatments (file picture) Doctors, MPs and campaigners last night condemned the plans as ‘barking mad’. The move will also fuel fears that the elderly are receiving a worse deal from the health service than the young. Cancer charities have already warned that ‘cruel restrictions’ mean older patients have been denied medical treatment, regardless of a proper assessment of their fitness levels and how likely they could  benefit from treatment. Sir Andrew Dillon, the head of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, said he was concerned about the new rules and feared they would lead to older patients being penalised in a ‘hard-nosed’ and ‘crude’ economic approach. Concern: Sir Andrew Dillon, the head of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, said he feared the rules would lead to older patients being penalised . The reforms, which are being consulted on, would see new drugs assessed for the first time based partly on whether they would benefit society as a whole – not just the patient. For example, a drug that helped people to live longer in an expensive care home, or on welfare, might have a ‘negative’ social value not outweighed by the benefit to the individual, because such patients take more from society than they can put back. Sir Andrew said: ‘There are lots of people who adopt the fair-innings approach: “You’ve had 70 years of life – you’ve got to accept society is going to bias its investments in younger people.” There are people who subscribe to that, but it’s not something we feel comfortable with.’ He said an initial assessment by Nice suggested that accounting for ‘wider societal benefit’ would inevitably tilt funding away from the old because younger patients had more to gain from treatment and more to give back. He added: ‘We’re really concerned that we don’t send out a message that we value life less when you’re 70 than when you’re 20.’ Ciarán Devane, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘The UK has some of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe and they are especially bad for older people. Macmillan strongly recommends against any action which could make this worse. The Nice board is right to reject the Department of Health’s proposal.’ Penny Mordaunt, Tory MP and co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on ageing and older people, said any new rules on societal benefit would be ‘absolutely wrong’.‘Age shouldn’t come into it,’ she said. ‘It’s about you as an individual and what drugs work for you. You cannot decide from someone’s age, their ability to benefit from treatment. It’s about them as an individual.’ Priorities: The move will also fuel fears that the elderly are receiving a worse deal from the health service than the young (file picture) Under the current system, Nice determines the cost of a new treatment by working out how much it improves and extends  a person’s life compared to existing treatments. It uses a formula known as ‘quality adjusted life year’ or QALY. One QALY equals one  year of perfect health, or two years of 50 per cent perfect health or four years of 25 per cent perfect health. Generally, if the cost per QALY is below £20,000, the treatment is deemed cost effective and approved. If it falls between £20,000 and £30,000, Nice needs ‘persuasion’ to give it the go-ahead. If the cost is more than £30,000, the drug is not normally approved. Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the health select committee, said: ‘I am sure that [restricting drugs to older people] is not the intention of the rules. If it is, it would be barking mad. Clearly people who have paid into the NHS should receive the support they need through their entire lives, including in retirement.’Ros Altmann, a former adviser to the Treasury on older people, said it was ‘very frightening’ that such a model was being considered. ‘It is quite Orwellian that it is being said that if you’re no longer fit for work, you aren’t owed anything by society,’ she said. ‘It is wrong to say older people do not contribute to society. They do so much voluntarily for their local community and for their families through free childcare for grandchildren. All this saves us billions of pounds.’ Leading prostate cancer specialist Professor Jonathan Waxman said Nice was an organisation ‘not fit  for purpose’. He added: ‘Nice has been the main brake on the availability of cancer drugs during the last decade and caused considerable distress and deaths based on an opaque and unscientific evaluation system. ‘We need transparency about how these decisions are made.’ A spokesman for the Department of Health said changing the rules would ensure good value for money – without penalising the elderly. He added: ‘That’s why we have asked Nice to look at the way drugs are assessed so that patients can get the treatments they need at the best value for the NHS.‘The allegation that older people will miss out is absolutely not true.’ Tory MP Penny Mordaunt said the rules would be 'absolutely wrong' while Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the Health Committee said the plans were 'barking mad'","Plans would consider 'wider societal benefits' when giving out medicines .

"David Moyes has been offered a route back into football with Real Sociedad. The Spanish club dismissed manager Jagoba Arrasate on Sunday after defeat by Malaga on Saturday, and they have turned to the former Manchester United and Everton boss . Moyes is currently in Qatar, where he has been working for BeIN Sports, and is understood to be considering the offer. Former Manchester United manager David Moyes has been offered the top job at Real Sociedad . Moyes had a tough spell at Manchester United and was sacked after less than a season in charge . Click here to read Matt Lawton's exclusive interview with David Moyes from August . But the 51-year-old Scot is understandably cautious when he knows the next job needs to be the right one after his difficult 10-month tenure at Old Trafford. United were the defending Premier League champions when Moyes arrived but slumped to seventh place, missing out on Champions League football for the first time since 1995-1996. United lost to Swansea City in the third round of the FA Cup, to Sunderland in the semi-finals of the League Cup and to Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Moyes was sacked in late April following a 2-0 defeat at his former club Everton and Ryan Giggs was placed in temporary charge. Louis van Gaal was appointed as his replacement in the summer. Wales boss Chris Coleman is the last British manager to have been in charge of Real Sociedad . John  Toshack (pictured holding a Real Sociedad shirt in 2001) has also managed the La Liga outfit . It is possible a number of opportunities could present themselves in Europe, with interest also thought to be coming from Italy. But Moyes, Sportsmail understands, is certainly interested enough to speak to the Spanish side, currently 19th in La Liga. They finished seventh in Spain’s top division last season and have a tradition of appointing British managers. John Toshack had three spells as boss and current Wales manager Chris Coleman was also in charge between July 2007 and January 2008. Prior to that, Harry Lowe, was in charge for five years in the 1930s. Horace Harold (Harry) Lowe, 1930-1935 . Lowe was a centre half from Northwich in Cheshire who played for Northwich Victoria, Brighton and Hove Albion, Tottenham and Fulham in the first two decades of the 20th century. He moved to Spain in 1930 and managed Real Sociedad for five season before leading Espanyol. He died in 1966. John Toshack, 1985-1989/1991-1994/2001-2002 . Welsh legend Toshack managed the club in three separate spells spanning three decades. He led Sociedad to the Copa del Rey in 1987, beating Atletico Madrid on penalties in the final. He returned to San Sebastian after his season at Real Madrid and then again during the 2001-2002 season. Chris Coleman, 2007-2008 . After Toshack had recommended the job to him, Coleman joined Sociedad, then a second division club, in June 2007. He enjoyed success but fell out with newly-elected president Inaki Badiola and resigned in January 2008 with the club fifth in the table.","David Moyes out of work since being sacked by Manchester United .

"Brendan McBride, 19, died after becoming stuck in the charity bin and bleeding to death as he tried to get clothes out . A teenager who was killed after getting stuck trying to climb into a clothes bank died by accident, a coroner has ruled. Brendan McBride, 19, was found by a passer-by suspended by his arm from the metal hatch of a charity clothes bin in Bradford. He had bled to death. It is thought that Mr McBride had been standing on a plastic container trying to reach into the bin when he slipped, trapping his arm and leaving him hanging. He was found by a member of the public walking to work next morning but pronounced dead at the scene. An inquest in Bradford heard how the hatch of the Save The Mothers Trust clothes bank in the Great Horton area of Bradford had caused a serious arm injury which led to significant blood loss. CCTV footage taken by the charity showed Mr McBride arrive at the bins in the Great Horton district of Bradford  between 11.45pm to 11.50pm. He was alone, wearing a fluorescent jacket and did not appear to be carrying anything with him. According to The Mirror, Coroner Roger Whittaker said: 'I'm clear from the evidence before me that Brendan was trying to obtain clothing from this piece of equipment. 'This in my view is a straightforward accident. It is an accidental death.' Previously Mr McBride’s mother, Paula Denison, 44, from Bradford, said: 'I don't know why he would have been trying to get into the bin that night - he could have been looking for somewhere to sleep.' 'He had a home here [where] he could have a bed, a meal, a bath when he wanted.  He'd spend a couple of nights here, maybe, then at his dad's or his friend's.' Mrs Denison, who has four other children, told the inquest she thought she had heard knocking on her door at midnight the night before her son's body was found. A coroner has ruled Mr McBride's death was an accident after a passerby found his body near these bins in Bradford the morning after he became trapped . The recently-unemployed teenager was found near Beckside Lane on 23 May by someone walking to work . She said: 'I thought I heard knocking at the back door at about midnight.  A neighbour said they heard something too, but I didn’t answer the door. 'Now I’m worried it could have been him.  I’ll have to live with that guilt.' Assistant Bradford Coroner, Dr Dominic Bell, was told Mr McBride had been drinking the night before he was found and had told his mother he was going to visit friends. She told him to be back by 9.30pm, but he never returned. Mrs Denison said her son had started drinking too much after losing a job he loved at a car breakers’ yard. She said: 'We were worried about him.  When he was working he loved being busy, but then when the job went it all changed, everything started going down and he drank too much... 'We are all heartbroken.  All we wanted for him was to enjoy his life, get another job and to be happy.' She added: 'It was a freak accident that no-one could have predicted, and in the end no-one could have stopped.' Save The Mothers Trust spokesman, Mohammad Shahid, said the charity would now be putting up a bigger fence made from metal. He said: 'We have been saying prayers for the young man and his family.'","A passer-by found Brendan McBride, 19, suspended from a clothes bank .

"Former Tottenham chairman Lord Sugar has defended current incumbent Daniel Levy amid increasing pressure. Mauricio Pochettino, Spurs' third head coach in a year, has endured a tough start to life at the White Hart Lane helm, failing to get his side playing the attractive, incisive style which became a hallmark of the Argentinian's time at Southampton. Worse still, the north Londoners have struggled to pick up points, with Sunday's 2-1 loss to Stoke their fourth defeat in just six Premier League home matches. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has come under increasing pressure after Tottenham's torrid start to the season . Lord Sugar (right) has defended his successor, saying that he is giving everything that can be expected . That poor start has seen those from Pochettino to technical director Franco Baldini come under fire, so too divisive chairman Levy. Supporters are aiming a lot of ire in his direction but former Tottenham chairman Sugar believes that anger is misdirected. 'All you can expect from a chairman is the following: to provide the money for your football staff to do what they want to do, negotiate hard and bitterly if one of your best players has got a death wish to want to leave, and to provide an environment like a new stadium or training ground and all that kind of stuff,' he told talkSPORT. 'That is all the chairman can do. Sugar received a lot of criticism of his own when in charge at Tottenham Hostpur for a decade . Sugar speaks outside Tottenham to deny a clash of egos between himself and Terry Venables . 'People saying 'Levy out, Levy out', they don't know what they are talking about. If Spurs are going to progress, he is their best ally. All he can do is listen to the managers that he appoints. 'They got £100million a year ago for the sale of Gareth Bale. They went out and spent it on seven players. Baldini, or whatever his name is, and Andre Villas-Boas must have had some input into that and therein lies the problem, in my opinion. 'If we have bought the wrong players and the money has been used irresponsibly, you have got to look at the person that guided you in that direction.'","Daniel Levy has received a lot of criticism from fans of Tottenham .

"Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief of Ofsted, said children are not being taught the basic skills needed to survive in the workplace . Millions of youngsters are too sloppy and slovenly to get jobs because they lack the discipline or skills needed for work, the chief inspector of schools said yesterday. School and college leavers are careless about time, lack a work ethic, do not dress or speak well and are lackadaisical, Sir Michael Wilshaw added in his scathing remarks. Employers think teenagers and those in their early 20s have never been taught how to behave and work or about the attitude they need to get on, he continued. Sir Michael, head of Ofsted, made his attack as the inspectorate published a highly critical report on the quality of  further education and sixth-form teaching for 16 to 19-year-olds. In particular, it savaged English and maths teaching, and failures in the way young people are guided towards careers. The report said there was no point in keeping young people in education until 18 if they did not gain qualifications or were not prepared for the demands of work. ‘Many employers complain that far too many young people looking for work have not been taught the skills, attitudes and behaviours they need to be  successful,’ Sir Michael warned. ‘It means they have a sloppy  attitude to punctuality. It means they are far too relaxed in terms of meeting deadlines. It means that far too many young people are  lackadaisical in the way they present themselves for work. ‘If they dress inappropriately, speak inappropriately and have poor social skills, they are not going to get a job. ‘Youth unemployment is far too high and it is in everyone’s interest that young people receive the very best education and training to improve this situation.’ His verdict came a day after an analysis by the wealthy nations grouping, the Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and Development, said only a quarter of  British graduates scored well in maths and English tests. This was . well below standards achieved at universities in rival countries. OECD . officials said in Japan, the top-rated country, foundations for good . language and maths skills were laid in schools but that is ‘not true for . the UK’. Sir . Michael said at the launch of the Ofsted report: ‘The gap between the . good intentions of  policy and the reality of what is happening is . worryingly wide.’ Scroll down for video . Mr . Wilshaw said career advice being given to children was often not up to . scratch, and did not include good work experience to prepare them for . the world of work . He added that too many teenagers drop out of post-16 education and disappear from the system, and too few get a chance of useful work experience. ‘Too few young people know what they want to do at 18 because the quality of careers guidance is shockingly poor,’ Sir Michael went on. ‘Too few students make sufficient progress in improving their English and maths because the teaching is simply not good enough. ‘Again, it is quite shocking that 84 per cent of youngsters who don’t get the GCSE at grade C in  English and maths at 16 fail again at 19.’ His remarks reflect the  long-standing despair felt by many employers. As a result of Labour’s 2008 Education and Skills Act, the school leaving age was raised from 16. By last year all teenagers had to stay on in education or training to 17. Next year, they cannot leave education or training until aged 18. Just under 1.18million young people aged 16 to 24 count as NEETS – not in employment, education or training. Yesterday’s report said too few schools and colleges had taken advantage of new ways to fund courses to boost standards. ‘Too much teaching in English and maths is not good enough as not enough learners are making sufficient progress in developing their reading, writing, oral  communication and mathematical skills,’ it warned. ‘There is a shortage of good  teachers of English and, in  particular, mathematics.’A spokesman at the Department for Education responded: ‘The number of young people NEET is at its lowest level since consistent records began. ‘We have scrapped thousands of low-quality qualifications so that only the gold-standard, employer-valued courses remain. ‘And providers are now incentivised to ensure young people study valuable courses.’","Sir Michael Wilshaw said careers advice in school was not up to scratch .

"Noah sailed past Jacob to become the most popular baby name for boys in 2013, ending Jacob's 14-year run at the top. Sophia was the most popular baby name for girls for the third straight year. The Social Security Administration announced the most popular baby names Friday. Noah was followed by Liam, Jacob, Mason and William. Sophia was followed by Emma, Olivia, Isabella and Ava. The rise of Noah and Liam highlights a trend toward more smooth-sounding baby names, said Laura Wattenberg, creator of Babynamewizard.com. Popular picks: Noah sailed past Jacob to become the top baby name for boys in 2013, ending Jacob's 14-year run at number one. Sophia was the most popular baby name for girls for the third straight year . 'You compare Jacob with all its hard, punchy consonants, versus Noah and Liam, you can really see where style is heading,' Ms Wattenberg said. She also noted that the most popular baby names aren't nearly as popular as they used to be. For example, a little more than 18,000 babies born last year were named Noah. In 1950, when James was number one, there were more than 86,000 newborns with that name. About 21,000 newborns were named Sophia last year. In 1950, more than 80,000 were named Linda, the top name for girls that year. 'In the past, most parents were picking from a pretty well-defined set of names,' Ms Wattenberg said. 'Literally for hundreds of years, the English royal names dominated. You had John and Mary and James and Elizabeth. 'Today,' she said, 'we get names everywhere.' These baby naming trends certainly seem to have taken hold in Hollywood. In the past two years alone, three prominent celebrities have named their newborn sons Noah: Megan Fox, whose son with Brian Austin Green was born in September 2012, Michael Buble, who had a boy with wife Luisana Lopilato in August 2013, and Alessandra Ambrosio, who gave birth to Noah Phoenix Ambrosio Mazur in May 2012.

Pamela Satran, founder of Nameberry.com, said of these monikers: 'We see the rise of Noah and Liam and the endurance of Sophia and Emma as a sign of great gender equality when it comes to parents' choice of baby names. 'Boys' names are becoming more ruled by pop culture and fashion, traditionally the domain of girls' names,' she told MailOnline. 'Girls' names are becoming more rooted in tradition and inspired by strong historic namesakes.' 'Compare Jacob with its hard, punchy consonants, versus Noah and Liam, and you can see where style is heading' She added that the many of the top . names are easy to pronounce in multiple languages, adding to their . appeal in an increasingly globalized society. Jacob first rose to number one in 1999. In the 45 years before that, Michael was king for all but one. There . has been a lot more variety among the girls. Mary dominated the first . half of the 20th century. But in the past two decades, Emily, Emma, . Isabella and Jessica have all spent time at the top. The Social Security Administration's . website provides lists of the top 1,000 baby names for each year, dating . to 1880. The top baby names that year were John and Mary. John is now . number 27 and Mary has fallen to number 121. One, two, three: Sophia Bush (left), Emma Stone (middle) and Olivia Palermo (right) have the first, second and third most popular girls names . Social Security also charts the . fastest-rising names each year. These names may not be in the top ten or . even the top 100, but they moved up more spots than any other. For girls, the runaway winner was Daleyza, which jumped a whopping 3,130 spots, to number 585. Daleyza is the name of the young daughter of Larry Hernandez, a singer who stars in a Spanish-language reality TV show called Larrymania. 'Reality TV is one of the biggest style makers today because it gives us a constant new stream of names from all over the place,' Ms Wattenberg said. For boys, the fastest rising name was Jayceon, which jumped 845 spots, to number 206. Two hip hop artists are named Jayceon. One simply goes by the name Jayceon.

"Ed Miliband yesterday dropped any mention of Britain’s vast budget deficit, immigration and welfare from his final party conference speech before the General Election. Instead, the Labour leader put an assault on the wealthy and more cash for the NHS at the heart of a statist bid for power. Retreating to his party’s old comfort zone, the Labour leader railed against owners of expensive homes, bankers, Tories, energy and tobacco companies and the media. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband dropped any mention of Britain’s vast budget deficit, immigration and welfare from his final party conference speech before the General Election. Aides said the speech ‘changed’ as it was being delivered . After the speech, Miliband attempted to kiss his wife Justine who pulled away but later managed to get it right . Last night it emerged that he had either ditched or forgotten to deliver a planned section promising to ‘get the deficit down’ and ‘no proposals for additional borrowing’. Extracts of his address released in advance to favoured journalists also revealed he had been expected to promise to make immigrants ‘learn English and earn their way’, but failed to do so. On welfare, Mr Miliband also neglected to say that all who can work ‘have a responsibility to do so’. Aides said the speech, delivered without notes, had ‘changed’ as it was being delivered. In what was widely seen as a lacklustre appearance at the conference in Manchester, which he described as the start of a ‘job interview’ to become Prime Minister, he sketched out a vision for a decade in Downing Street. While the Conservatives told people ‘you’re on your own’, the Labour leader said that if elected he would seek to fashion an interventionist state based on something he called ‘the principle of together’. He said he would tax tobacco companies, owners of valuable properties and hedge funds to raise £2.5 billion to pay for 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 extra GPs, 5,000 careworkers and 3,000 midwives. A ‘mansion tax’ would be introduced on more than 100,000 homes worth more than £2 million. Businesses would be required to pay a minimum wage of £8 an hour by 2020, big banks ‘broken up’ and firms that want government contracts made to take on apprentices. Developers will no longer be allowed to ‘sit on land’, which will be released for housebuilding, ‘cruel and vindictive’ cuts to housing benefit will be reversed and all electricity required to be environmentally friendly by 2030. Miliband went in for a kiss with his wife Justine but had to brush it off when she accidentally moved away . The pair joked about the mishap before later having a quick peck in front of the clapping crowd and cameras . The House of Lords will be scrapped and replaced with a ‘National Senate of the Nations and the Regions’ and 16- and 17-year-olds will be given the vote. ‘Friends, it is time we ran the country like we know it can be run,’ Mr Miliband said in the 68-minute speech. The Labour leader, who used the word ‘together’ 47 times, said he aimed to ‘restore people’s faith in the future’. ‘I’m not talking about changing a policy, or simply a different programme. But something that is bigger: transforming the idea, the ethic, of how our country is run. ‘What people across England, Scotland and Wales, across every part of the UK, are saying is this country doesn’t care about me. Politics doesn’t listen. 'The economy doesn’t work. And they are not wrong. They are right. But this Labour Party has a plan to put it right.’ Mr Miliband also reeled off a list of people and organisations he said he had ‘stood up to’, including Rupert Murdoch over phone hacking, banks over bonuses, payday lenders and energy companies over their profits and the Daily Mail when it ran an article about his father’s views. After the speech, the Labour leader was forced to brush off an embarrassing mishap after moving in to kiss wife Justine - who pulled away at the crucial moment. The gaffe occurred when he brought her to the centre of the stage to wave to the crowd and cameras. The pair managed to laugh off the mishap and later had a peck on the lips to make up for it. Last night Labour MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk said Mr Miliband appeared to have a ‘mental block’ on immigration and welfare. ‘He talks a lot in his speech about meeting Gareth and Josephine and others in the park or the pub,’ he said. ‘It seems strange that none of them he’s met have mentioned immigration and welfare. ‘You do wonder if he has a mental block about talking about these issues.’ Chancellor George Osborne said it was ‘extraordinary’ Mr Miliband ‘didn’t mention the deficit once’. ‘If you can’t fix the economy you can’t fund the NHS,’ he added. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the union Unite, Labour’s biggest financial backer, was delighted with Mr Miliband’s speech. ‘The keys of No 10 are within his grasp,’ he said. But Grant Shapps, the Conservative party chairman, said: ‘All Ed Miliband offers is more wasteful spending, more borrowing and more taxes. 'You can’t fund the NHS if you lose control of the nation’s finances and bankrupt the economy like Labour did last time.’ A Labour government will hit thousands of pubs and clubs with a late-night-opening tax – in a blunt admission of the chaos caused by its 24-hour drinking laws. Yesterday Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said drinking venues in some areas which want to open beyond midnight will be forced to pay up to £4,400 a year extra. The party leader, who used the word ‘together’ 47 times, said he aimed to ‘restore people’s faith in the future’ Aides said Mr Miliband's speech, which was given without notes, had ‘changed’ as it was being delivered . Ed Miliband has an approval rating of minus 23 per cent, making him the most unpopular since Foot . Ed Miliband is the most unpopular opposition leader in the run-up to a General Election since Michael Foot, polls have shown. Mr Foot is the only politician in the past 40 years to have a worse rating than Mr Miliband 12 months ahead of an election, according to researchers Ipsos Mori. Mr Miliband is languishing with an approval rating of minus 23 per cent. At this point before the 2010 election, David Cameron had an approval rating of plus 23 per cent. Only those leaders with positive approval ratings – Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and Mr Cameron – went on to become Prime Minister, while all those with negative ratings lost the election. Confronted with the appalling figures for Labour on BBC’s Newsnight, the party’s education spokesman Tristram Hunt claimed that he wasn’t concerned. ‘The great thing about being in Ed Miliband’s team is that we’re in the history-busting business,’ he said. It was reported yesterday that Mr Miliband suspects anti-semitism may be behind some of the hostility towards him.","Ed Miliband failed to mention the budget deficit, immigration and welfare .

"QPR have been charged by the Football Association with failing to control their players during the 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw against Manchester City on Saturday. Rangers players were incensed when referee Mike Riley denied striker Charlie Austin two goals in the eighth minute - the first for offside and the second for an infringement by City goalkeeper Joe Hart. An FA statement read: 'It is alleged that in or around the 8th minute of the fixture, the club failed to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion. Joe Hart stumbled slightly in his run up before appearing to give the ball straight to Austin from a free-kick . Hart had actually caught the ball with his standing foot, meaning that he had played the ball twice in the box, and had to retake the kick as a result . QPR players were incensed with referee Mike Dean after seeing two goals disallowed inside a minute . 'The club has until 6pm on 17 November 2014 to respond to the charge.' Austin did eventually score a goal that counted in the 21st minute to put QPR ahead but two Sergio Aguero goals sandwiched an own goal from Martin Demichelis as the spoils were shared. Harry Redknapp's men were not the only side to be charged with his offence on Thursday, as Sunderland also had action take against them from the FA after their players reaction to the award of an Everton penalty on Sunday - which Leighton Baines scored from.","QPR drew 2-2 with champions Manchester City at Loftus Road on Saturday .

Screen legends: Mr Low also drew actors Johnny Depp and Jack Nicholson . Celebrities: Bahamian born boxer Kimbo Slice and actor Samuel L. Jackson . 'In fact, through our campaign, we found out that many parents actually think that their dyslexic children are retarded or mentally disabled. 'This year, we came out with a second phase to address the issue. 'We used well-known celebrities who were dyslexics to illustrate that dyslexia is not a curse, but a gift.

It proved that anyone with dyslexia could be successful as well. 'In terms of art direction, I was looking for a certain style that could be easily understood yet difficult to execute. 'My initial drawings met the brief and were accepted by my creative director but I was not satisfied. I tried again, this time experimenting with scribbles to draw a portrait of Kimbo Slice.

"Real Sociedad president Jokin Aperribay has revealed the club is talking to former Manchester United boss David Moyes about their managerial vacancy. Moyes has been without a club since leaving Old Trafford in April last season, but has not been short of suitors. Now, Spanish club Sociedad are attempting to lure the 51-year-old to La Liga. Aperribay said: 'There are several names, and it is true those of (Pepe) Mel and Moyes.' David Moyes has been without a job since leaving Manchester United in April last season . Real Sociedad sacked their manager Jagoba Arrasate after Sociedad won just one of their first 10 games . The Basque club are considering four coaches to replace Jagoba Arrasate, who was fired on Sunday after just one victory in the team's first 10 league games. 'We are trying to get to know each of the four people we are negotiating with,' said Apperribay. Existing coaches Asier Santana and Imanol Alguacil will take charge for Sunday's home game against defending champions Atletico Madrid. Sociedad finished fourth in La Liga two seasons ago but their participation in the Champions League affected their domestic form, leading to a seventh-placed finish in 2013-14. Their decline has continued again this season with The Royals currently sitting second from bottom with just six points. Were Moyes to take the job, some fans might be surprised, but the club have a history of appointing British managers. Chris Coleman took charge of the then-second division side in 2007, John Toshack managed the club in three separate spells (1985-89, 1991-94, 2001-02), while Harry Lowe led the club between 1930-35.

"A teacher allegedly ordered a 10-year-old boy to take off his Help for Heroes wristband because it could cause offence. Tracy Tew was shocked when her son Charlie was put on a report card at Maldon Primary School in Essex after he refused to take off the charity rubber bracelet sold to honour injured soldiers. Charlie wears the wristband - bought at the Colchester Military Festival - in honour of murdered solider Lee Rigby and service personnel in his family, including his great-granddad and uncle. 'Could cause offence': Tracy Tew was shocked when her son Charlie was put on a report card at Maldon Primary School in Essex after he refused to take off the charity rubber bracelet sold to honour injured soldiers . Mrs Tew, 38, a domestic service assistant at a hospital, said: ‘We are really proud of Charlie for sticking to his guns. He wanted to keep it on and he didn’t agree with the reasons why he shouldn’t. The mother of two added: ‘When the teacher said she was worried it was going to offend people, I thought it was disgusting. Our family are up in arms because we are all military minded. ‘With what happened with Lee Rigby, Charlie really wanted to wear a wristband.’ Drummer Rigby, 25, was killed by two Islamic fanatics in Woolwich, south-east London, in May last year. Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were jailed for the murder last month. Headteacher Tracy Thornton insisted wearing wristbands is against the school’s jewellery policy. Reasoning: Charlie wears the wristband (left) - bought at the Colchester Military Festival - in honour of murdered solider Lee Rigby (right) and service personnel in his family, including his great-granddad and uncle .

Parry, co-founder and CEO of Help for Heroes, told MailOnline: ‘A . school's uniform policy is a matter for the principal and governors. ‘However, . over 6million wristbands are proudly being worn in support of our . wounded servicemen and women, including many wristbands on the frontline . in Afghanistan. ‘We have not heard of a single health and safety . incident connected to them, nor have we ever had a complaint that they . are offensive. Response: Maldon Primary School headteacher Tracy Thornton insisted wearing wristbands is against the jewellery policy. She said children are 'not allowed to wear jewellery except small silver studs and watches' ‘We do also have a wonderful range of other items . such as lapel badges for those who are keen to show their support for . our wounded.’ Terry . Sutton, Colchester president of the Royal British Legion - a separate charity to Help for Heroes - said he has never heard of anyone taking . offence to wristbands backing military charities.

"Sacked coach Jagoba Arrasate insists he is departing Real Sociedad with a clear conscience even though he leaves with the team stuck in the Primera Division relegation zone and already out of Europe. Arrasate was handed his marching orders on Sunday night following a miserable start to the season that has seen Sociedad pick up just six points from a possible 30 in La Liga. That has left the Basque club - who finished fourth in 2013 and seventh last term - in 19th place in the standings and two points from safety ahead of next weekend's daunting visit of champions Atletico Madrid. Jagoba Arrasate leaves a press conference at Real Sociedad's Zubieta training complex having been sacked as the club's manager following a poor start to the season . Sociedad were also knocked out of the Europa League before the group stages following a humiliating defeat to Russian side Krasnodar in August. Nevertheless, Arrasate, who enjoyed a decent first season in charge last term having previously been a youth team coach and then a first-team assistant to his predecessor Philippe Montanier at the Anoeta, feels he can leave with his head held high. He said at a press conference on Monday: 'I'm sad to be going, but with a clear conscience. Arrasate admitted being upset over leaving Sociedad with the club stuck in the relegation zone in La Liga . 'I understand the board's decision, they maintained their confidence in me until the last moment. What hurts me most is to leave La Real in this situation. I will be relieved when the team is much higher. 'I've been proud to have been coach of La Real, it's been a privilege .

On the subject of his successor, Arrasate said: 'I'm sure that whoever comes in will be well prepared and I wish them the best.

"Under fire Ed Balls put personal criticism to one side last night – by dancing Gangnam Style with other Labour big wigs at the party’s annual celebration of multiculturalism. The shadow chancellor, who was booed by activists earlier yesterday after unveiling real-terms cuts to child benefit, joined his wife Yvette Cooper and host Keith Vaz at the party’s infamous ‘diversity night’ in Manchester. Mr Vaz maintained tradition by putting in a showman’s performance, donning sunglasses and sharing the stage with belly dancers during the dance marathon. Scroll down for video . Ed Balls (right), his wife Yvette Cooper (left) and the Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz (centre) danced 'Gangnam Style' at the annual conference 'diversity night' Mr Balls, fresh from provoking anger among Labour activists after announcing real-terms cuts to child benefit, was cheered as he danced into the night . Mr Balls and his wife, the shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, are regular attendees at the celebration of multiculturalism . He also risked controversy by joking that many of the migrants trapped in Calais may be able to join the party next year. He said: ‘We’ve got a raffle tonight. The first prize is a return ticket to Paris by Eurostar. ‘You could stop at Calais on the way and have a look at all those lovely people who will be at diversity night next year.’ Mr Vaz appeared delighted when two scantily-clad performers tied bright sashes to him and gyrated either side of him. Ten shadow cabinet members joined the party, including Chuka Umunna, Harriet Harman and Sadiq Khan. They performed the cult Gangnam dance – made famous by the South Korean pop star Psy – as confetti fell from the ceiling. Coronation Street actors Shobna Gulati and Jimmi Harkishin - better known as characters Sunita and Dev – attended and were awarded the Diversity Award 2014, presented by Mr Vaz. Speaking after the event Ms Cooper hailed the annual celebration of multiculturalism. She said: ‘You just could not miss diversity night. It is the best party in the entire conference.’ Mr Vaz’s party conference was further boosted yesterday after it emerged that one his ancestors is in line to become a saint. The Blessed Joseph Vaz, a 17th-century missionary known as the Apostle of Ceylon, is likely to be canonised in January, when Pope Francis visits Sri Lanka. Mr Vaz donned shades for his performance with belly dancers at the 'unmissable' Monday-night party . The Home Affairs Select Committee chairman has had a good party conference after it was revealed an ancestor was set to be canonised by the Pope . Showman Mr Vaz has turned the annual gathering into a cult night popular with activists and politicians alike . Mr Balls performed the Gangnam dance made famous by South Korean singer Psy . Home Affairs Committee member Paul Flynn said canonisation was a ‘family trait’ which may spur on the Leicester MP to aim for greater things. He said: ‘This news will bring deep satisfaction to the members of the committee. It has certainly made my day. ‘I know that Keith has a picture of the Pope in his office. What we don’t know if whether the Pope has a picture of Keith on his wall. ‘We can but hope that the announcement today is a harbinger of great things to come for Keith. 'There’s only a few accolades left for him to win.’ Mr Flynn, a veteran Labour backbench MP, suggested the news may help attract an even greater class of witness to Mr Vaz’s committee. Celebrities including Russell Brand, Shilpa Shetty and Mitch Winehouse have already been called to give evidence to MPs. But Mr Flynn said: ‘He already has an impressive list of contacts, but this can only help.’ Mr Vaz said he was delighted with the news, but revealed he was unlikely to be allowed to visit Sri Lanka because of his outspoken criticism of the country’s treatment of the Tamil minority. He said: ‘People are always proud to say they are related to royalty, but few MPs can boast of a saint in the family.’ A senior Labour source said: ‘Is there no end to the Vaz family’s talents?’","Shadow chancellor joined other Labour big wigs at 'diversity night' party .

"The Home Depot believes that a cyberattack earlier this year affected 56 million unique payment cards as part of the largest retail security breach in history. The Atlanta-based home retailer, which has more than 2,000 stores nationwide, says it has now eliminated the malware behind the attacks that took place between April and September. It said it has also completed a 'major' payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of customers' payment data in its U.S. stores. Scroll down for video . Breach: The retailer has said it has now  eliminated malware from its U.S. and Canadian networks that affected 56 million unique payment cards between April and September (file picture) In December, Target Corp. disclosed a massive data breach that was the second-largest in history, resulting in the theft of 40 million debit and credit card numbers and the potential exposure of personal information of up to 70 million shoppers. According to the Federal Trade Commission, one of the only ways customers can see if you have been hit by the hack is by checking  bank statements for irregularities. You can also initiate a credit freeze - also known as a security freeze - which limits the access you have to credit reports, meaning hackers have less of an opportunity to open accounts in your name. In response to the breach, Home Depot is offering a year's coverage through identity theft protection programs - AllClear ID and AllClear PRO. It says that service is free. In order to protect yourself in the future, experts have suggested signing up to annualcreditreport.com. The service allows individuals to check if there has been any fraudulent activity on the account on a yearly basis. There are also more simple methods such as using different passwords for different accounts and primarily using credit cards for transactions - because they have better identity protection. Home Depot is believed to have been hit by the same malicious software program that stole card account data from cash registers at Target. Retailers, banks and card companies have responded to the breaches by speeding the adoption of microchips in U.S. credit and debit cards - a technology that helps makes transactions more secure. The U.S. is one of the only countries in the world to still use magnetic strips - one of the least safe ways of making a transaction - ahead of chip-based methods of payment. According to Krebs on Security, the hack focused on the self-service lanes at the stores. A source close to the investigation told the site that an analysis revealed  some of Home Depot's store registers had been infected with a new variant of 'BlackPOS' - also known as 'Kaptoxa'. It is a strain of malware designed to siphon data from cards when they are swiped at infected point-of-sale systems running Microsoft Windows. To try and combat this, Home Depot has announced that it plans to have chip-enabled checkout terminals at all of its U.S. stores by the end of this year. The store has also confirmed its sales-growth estimates for the fiscal year and expects to earn $4.54 per share in fiscal 2014, up 2 cents from its prior guidance. Home Depot CEO Frank Blake said in a statement: 'We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and anxiety this has caused, and want to reassure them that they will not be liable for fraudulent charges. 'From the time this investigation began, our guiding principle has been to put our customers first, and we will continue to do so.'

"David Moyes has been offered a route back into management by struggling Spanish side Real Sociedad. Manager Jagobo Arrasate was dismissed on Sunday after their latest insipid display, a 1-0 loss at home to Malaga that leaves them 19th in La Liga. The club have since approached Moyes, who was sacked by Manchester United in April, in a bid to revive their fortunes. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson talks you through the main talking points of Moyes potential arrival at the Anoeta Stadium .

Moyes had a tough spell at Manchester United and was sacked after less than a season in charge . You’re not following Fergie; you’re following Arrasate, a hugely inexperienced coach who probably should never have got the job. How much of a surprise would Moyes taking over be? Athletic Bilbao showed an interest when he was at Everton so he is known and respected in the Basque country. Sociedad also have a track record of British managers with Chris Coleman and John Toshack both former coaches. It might be surprising if they end up being able to afford Moyes (right) though. They picked Arrasate because he was the cheapest option. Horace Harold (Harry) Lowe, 1930-1935 .

He returned to San Sebastian after his season at Real Madrid and then again during the 2001-2002 season. John  Toshack (pictured holding a Real Sociedad shirt in 2001) has also managed the La Liga outfit . Chris Coleman, 2007-2008 . After Toshack had recommended the job to him, Coleman joined Sociedad, then a second division club, in June 2007. He enjoyed success but fell out with newly-elected president Inaki Badiola and resigned in January 2008 with the club fifth in the table. Wales boss Chris Coleman is the last British manager to have been in charge of Real Sociedad . Weren’t they in the Champions League just last season? They had the basis of a very good team but as soon as they reached the Champions League they started selling their best players. Asier Illaramendi joined Real Madrid and this summer Atletico Madrid pinched Antoine Greizmann while Claudio Bravo moved to Barcelona. So what are the expectations? Europa League is the realistic aim. Atletico are so strong there is only really one Champions League spot left and Valencia, Sevilla and Bilbao are well ahead in the race for that. It feels like a great fall from Manchester United? San Sebastian is a fantastic city. Moyes will be given time and the playing squad is talented. Carlos Vela scores goals, midfielder Ruben Pardo is a huge talent, and defender Inigo Martinez was close to the Spain squad, and to a move to Barcelona, not so long ago. The raw materials are there to build a decent team — and he would be given more than one season to do the job this time.

"A girl guide group faces being thrown out of the national association after refusing to force members to drop God from the oath. Troop leaders have rejected new rules saying that the inclusion of God should not be compulsory but a matter of personal choice. But they have now been sent an ‘aggressive’ letter ordering them to back down or leave GirlGuiding UK at the end of the month. Critics branded the approach a ‘move for exclusion’. Glynis Mackie (centre) leader of the 37th Newcastle Guide Unit at Jesmond Parish Church said the new pledge 'sidelined' Christianity. She is pictured with guides  Hibah Ali, 14, (left) and Becky McClintock, 12 (right) The Guiding Promise was altered earlier this year so that members now swear ‘to be true to myself and develop my beliefs’ rather than the original ‘to love my God’. But Glynis Mackie, 55, who has been leading the 37th Newcastle Guide Unit in Jesmond for more than 25 years, said the new pledge ‘sidelined’ Christianity. Mrs Mackie, added: ‘This is an example of people not realising the importance of faith, of all faiths, in our community. 'I would go as far as saying that it is an example of faith being sidelined in society.’ ‘I imagine changing the pledge was intended to include more people, but what it is actually doing is excluding those who have faith. ‘I understand why an atheist might not want to make a promise to God, and that is fine by me, but it has to be up to the individual.’ Mrs Mackie and the other leaders of the group slammed the new pledge as a ‘fridge magnet promise that doesn’t really mean anything’. The Girl Guide promise had been changed after over 100 years of tradition . But Chief Guide Gill Slocombe insisted the move ‘opened our arms to . welcome even more girls and adults, of all faiths –  and none’. The words ‘to be true to myself and develop my beliefs’ have replaced ‘to love my God’, and the words ‘to serve the Queen and my community’ will replace ‘to serve the Queen and my country’. Girl Guiding’s chief commissioner in the North East has told the group their membership of the organisation will be ended on December 31. It means that the unit, which includes more than 100 girls in Rainbows, Brownies, Guides and Rangers from a variety of different faiths, will now have to meet as an independent group. She added: ‘This letter, which is surprisingly aggressive, says that we ""will not use"" the new Promise and that simply isn’t true. ‘We would use this new form of words but we do want the children to have the choice to say the old Promise if they want to.’ Mrs Mackie wants Girl Guiding to take the same stance as the Scouts’ pledge, which says a member will ‘uphold our Scout values’ and can be taken by those who do not choose to vow to ‘do my duty to God’. She added: ‘They are trying to force us out of Girl Guiding with no process and with only three weeks’ notice. The girls are really incredibly angry and they just want their voices to be heard.’ Chief Guide Gill Slocombe said: ‘Girl guiding is extremely sorry to hear of any Guide group leaving our organisation. ‘By changing the wording of our promise, after an extensive consultation with over 44,000 people, we have opened our arms to welcome even more girls and adults - of all faiths and none - who will benefit from all the fantastic things we do in girl guiding. ‘We hope the new wording will help us reach out to girls and women who might not have considered guiding before, so that even more girls can benefit from everything guiding can offer.’ David Holloway, the vicar of Jesmond Parish Church, wrote in the church’s monthly newsletter: ‘The hard reality is that this new promise is, whether intentionally or not, a move for exclusion.’ The changing of the Guide promise earlier this year sparked 839 official complaints from members amid fears of a split in the movement. In August, one troop in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, vowed to resist the change but was forced to back down by national leaders.","Newcastle branch received 'aggressive' letter ordering them to comply .

"Memory loss: Forgetting where you put your keys or someone's name is a perfectly normal part of the aging process and well underway by the age of 40, scientists have said . Forgetting where you put your keys or someone's name is a perfectly normal part of the aging process and well underway by the age of 40, scientists have said. Experts have found that cognitive decline speeds up once people reach middle age, however, they are working on a solution to the problem. They believe the answer lies in the NDMA receptors in the brain, in particular the receptors GluN2B subunits which help people to remember things. These subunits start to be lost among small children, and by the time a person reaches retirement age they will have around half the amount of someone much younger. Separate this loss from more serious problems like dementia and Alzheimer's disease, virtually everyone loses memory-making and cognitive abilities as they age. Researchers at the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University have clarified that cognitive decline with age is a natural part of life and are searching hard to find ways of slowing it. 'These are biological processes, and once we fully understand what is going on, we may be able to slow  or prevent it,' said Kathy Magnusson, a neuroscientist in the OSU Department of Biomedical Sciences and professor in the Linus Pauling Institute. 'There may be ways to influence it with diet, health habits, continued mental activity or even drugs.' Professor Magnusson added: 'The NMDA receptor has been known of for decades. It plays a role in memory and learning but isn't active all the time, it takes a fairly strong stimulus of some type to turn it on and allow you to remember something. 'The routine of getting dressed in the morning is ignored and quickly lost to the fog of time, but the day you had an auto accident earns a permanent etching in your memory.' Within the NMDA receptor are various subunits, and research, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, keeps pointing back to the GluN2B subunit as one of the most important. Knowledge: Infants and children have lots of GluN2B subunits, and as a result are like a sponge in soaking up memories and learning new things . Infants and children have lots of them, and as a result are like a sponge in soaking up memories and learning new things. But they gradually dwindle in number with age, and it also appears the ones that are left work less efficiently. She said: 'You can still learn new things and make new memories when you are older, but it's not as easy. 'Fewer messages get through, fewer connections get made, and your brain has to work harder.' Scientists have used a genetic therapy in laboratory mice, in which a virus helped carry complementary DNA into appropriate cells and restored some GluN2B subunits. Tests showed that it helped mice improve their memory and cognitive ability. Slowing the process: The best advice for maintaining cognitive function is to keep using your brain, and get physical exercise . However such gene therapy would probably be a last choice for humans, rather than a first option, as dietary or drug options would be explored first. Professor Magnusson said: 'Until more specific help is available, some of the best advice for maintaining cognitive function is to keep using your brain. 'Break old habits, do things different ways. Get physical exercise, maintain a good diet and ensure social interaction. 'Such activities help keep these subunits active and functioning. 'The one thing that does seem fairly clear is that cognitive decline is not inevitable, it's biological. 'We're finding out why it happens, and it appears there are ways we might be able to slow or stop it, perhaps repair the NMDA receptors. If we can determine how to do that without harm, we will.'","Experts found cognitive decline speeds up when people reach middle age .

"Professor Les Ebdon said they should admit undergraduates according to ¿academic potential¿ . A university watchdog has told campuses to help poorer pupils win more places by looking beyond would-be students’ qualifications when recruiting. Professor Les Ebdon said they should admit undergraduates according to ‘academic potential’ rather than simply totting up their GCSEs and A-levels. The head of the Office for Fair Access (Offa) also revealed he had intervened at 26 universities to insist they make targets for recruiting poorer pupils more ambitious. He said the most privileged fifth of pupils were eight times more likely to be offered a place at a leading university than the most disadvantaged fifth. Professor Ebdon added: ‘Fair access is about searching out academic potential wherever it is – in every type of neighbourhood, every type of school and every age group, ethnic group and gender. ‘It’s about acknowledging that a wide range of people have the potential to become the excellent graduates who will later run our businesses and lead our country – not just the privileged few.’ Labour will siphon public funding from elite universities towards those providing vocational education, it will announce today. Ed Miliband wants to introduce ‘technical degrees’ and will put universities that offer them on the priority list for expansion. The Labour leader believes the degrees will help the ‘forgotten 50 per cent’ who do not go to university.

"Al Gore's only son has married his girlfriend in a formal ceremony in Washington D.C.'s main train station. Albert Gore married Brittany Toscano, a friend he met while his father was serving as Vice President and they both were attending high school in D.C. The couple did not date in school but reconnected at a New Year's Eve party in 2010. The ceremony: Albert Gore, the former Vice President's youngest child, got married to Brittany Toscano at Union Station in D.C. on Saturday after four years of dating . Formal: The black tie affair was held at the train station because the couple said it played an important role in the start of their relationship as they were living apart in D.C. and New York . Intimate: The couple did not announce how many people attended the ceremony but a spokesman said that they kept it to close friends and family . Before the busy weekend: Albert, 31, and Brittany, 28, shared a quiet moment ahead of the formal ceremonies . People magazine tells how they started dating even though Albert, now 31, was living in New York City at the time and Ms Toscano, now 28, was in Washington for her non-profit work. The couple chose to get married at Union Station because it was such an important part of the beginning of their relationship- helping them visit one another on the weekends. Details about the event were sparse and the number of guests in attendance is still not known, but both of the bride's parents were there as were both parents of the groom. The former Vice President and his wife Tipper announced that they were separating in 2010 and have led different lives ever since but they have not formally divorced. Stunning: The bride's lace dress was made by Monique Lhuillier and featured a peplum skirt . Rehearsal attire: Ms Toscano, who previously worked as a fundraiser for non-profits, wore a thematically-similar white lace dress to their rehearsal dinner the night before the ceremony . Prep: After being friends in high school, the couple reconnected at a New Year's Eve party in 2010 . Every angle: Hair stylist Ky Walker Designs shared a photo showing the intricate updo . Father of the groom: Both Al and Tipper Gore were reportedly at the ceremony but they were not pictured, though the former Vice President did pose with one of his son's friends at their engagement party in New York in late April (pictured) Prior indiscretions: Albert Gore was arrested in 2007 for suspected marijuana possession in California . Friends’ photos of the event show that the couple got married on a stage constructed in one of the event spaces with at five bridesmaids and at least four groomsmen. The bride, who has since moved to New York City to be closer to her new husband, wore a Monique Lhuillier gown and the groom wore a tuxedo. A family spokesperson said that they kept the guest list small. 'The couple wanted to create an intimate occasion and relied on family and friends for many aspects of the wedding,' the unidentified spokesperson told People. Wedding planning has likely been a regular conversation among the Gore family in recent months since Albert's older sister Sarah tied the knot just two months ago. Sarah Gore's nuptials were significantly more low-key than the Saturday reception held in Union Station. Her wedding, which marked the start of her second marriage, took place outside a coffee shop in Montecito, California and they exchanged vows underneath a historic pine tree in April. Relatively low profile: The former Vice President's son has kept out of the spotlight in recent years, and his decision to accompany his parents to the Academy Awards in 2007, when An Inconvenient Truth was nominated, was one of his last public appearances . Different approach: Albert wasn't part of the extremely small group who attended his sister Sarah's wedding in Montecito, California in late April (Al Gore seen walking her down the aisle)","Al Gore's youngest child Albert, 31, married his girlfriend of more than four years, Brittany Toscano .

"Nearly 100 female British soldiers have been sent home from Afghanistan after finding out they were pregnant. Between January 2006 and December last year, 99 servicewomen on operations have been flown back to the UK under strict military rules that ban mothers-to-be from serving in a war zone. According to figures released by the Ministry Of Defence, 16 women were removed from Afghanistan in 2013 due to pregnancy, while 18 were sent home in 2011. Mums Army: Nearly 100 female British soldiers have been sent home from Afghanistan after finding out they were pregnant. In September 2012 Lance Bombardier Lynette Pearce (pictured) gave birth to a son in Camp Bastion . Little trooper: Lance Bombardier Pearce's son Immanuel with his grandmother Sugar . The women were flown back on flights . usually reserved for injured troops, meaning the true figure could be . higher if other female soldiers came home via routine flights, according to The Sun. Troops are repeatedly . reminded by senior officers to check they are not pregnant before they fly to the front . line, however, servicewomen are . not forced to take a urine test before deploying because top brass . consider it would be an ‘invasion of privacy’. In September 2012 it was revealed that Lance . Bombardier Lynette Pearce, then 28, gave birth to a son at the field . hospital in Camp Bastion, four days after the base was attacked by the . Taliban. Front line: Servicemen and women at Camp Bastion stand at ease before their Armistice Day parade . The Fijian-born junior . non-commissioned officer in the Royal Artillery had a healthy boy five . weeks prematurely, not knowing she was pregnant. She shocked military chiefs when she became the first UK soldier to have a baby on the battlefield, naming the child Immanuel Izadore Pearce. Speaking after the birth, Lance Bombardier Pearce's mother Sugar said her daughter met the baby’s father in the UK after joining the Army. Women now make up ten per cent of Armed Forces personnel. They account for 14 per cent of the RAF, nine per cent of the Navy and eight per cent of the Army. There are currently 8,340 women serving in the British Army, 3010 in the Royal Navy and 4,950 in the Royal Air Force. In 1949, women were officially . recognised as a permanent part of British Armed forces, but it was not . until the 1991 Gulf War that women were first deployed in combat roles. Women first became eligible to pilot . Royal Air Force combat aircraft in 1989 and the following year, they were . permitted to serve on Royal Navy warships. Although they can serve on the front line, women are not permitted to perform roles where the 'primary duty is to close with and kill the enemy', meaning they can not join the Infantry, Household Cavalry, Royal Armoured Corps, Royal Marines Commandos, RAF Regiment, Special Air Service and Special Boat Service. During deployment women serve as combat medics or engagement officers. After the birth she and Immanuel, who weighed a healthy 5lb 8oz, were flown to the UK and treated at the John Radcliffe Hospital . in Oxford. And in February 2011 it was revealed how how Private Kayla Donnelly, then 21, served on the front line in . Afghanistan’s Helmand Province while seven months pregnant. She had . conceived before going to the war zone. Pte Donnelly, from . Penrith, Cumbria, who serves with 12 Logistic Support Regiment, put the . changes to her body and weight gain down to high-calorie army rations . and the stress of war. She only realised she was expecting two weeks . after she returned home and gave birth to son Josh. The figures were revealed following a request under the Freedom of Information Act. 'Pregnant women are not allowed to be deployed on operations,' an MOD spokesman told MailOnline. 'The small numbers of personnel who discover that they are pregnant on operations  are returned at the first convenient opportunity. 'The MOD does not encourage or condone sexual relationships in theatre; our personnel are expected to behave in accordance with the Armed Forces values and standards at all times.' The women all discovered they were . pregnant while in Afghanistan, although it is not known if any of the . babies were conceived there. Servicemen and women are warned that the Ministry of Defence does not approve of sexual relations between . troops and that any inappropriate behaviour would breach standards . guidelines. Those caught having sex usually face a rebuke from . their commanding officer or more serious disciplinary action, depending . on the rank and position of those involved. Restricted: Although they can serve on the front line, women are not permitted to perform roles where the 'primary duty is to close with and kill the enemy' Servicemen and women get three weeks off before they deploy to . Afghanistan and two weeks rest and recuperation during their tour of . duty. Deployments to . Afghanistan usually last between six and seven months, although with . combat operations set to end later this year some tours have been . extended to nine months. At . least 102 servicewomen were sent home from Iraq after finding out they . were pregnant, before British forces withdrew from the country in 2009. Soldiers heading for Afghanistan . undergo stringent medical checks to make sure they can cope with the . rigours of combat – but not pregnancy tests. Servicemen and women take part in pre-deployment training for about six months before they fly to the war zone. It includes arduous physical tests, . such as an eight-mile march carrying a 40lb backpack, press-ups, sit-ups . and a 1.5-mile run against the clock. Then there are a number of routine . medical examinations depending on their roles, including hearing, . eyesight and dental checks, and tests of body mass index. They also have blood pressure, heart . rate and lung capacity monitored and recorded. ‘We need to know people . are fit enough to leg it to a helicopter, for instance, if there is an . attack,’ said a Ministry of Defence spokesman. Personnel are also given any vaccinations they need to ward off tropical diseases and a course of anti-malaria tablets. Female soldiers are asked whether they . are – or suspect they are – pregnant. This is routine so medical staff . can ensure the inoculation does not damage an unborn baby. If they answer ‘yes’, then they will . not be allowed to deploy. But if the response is ‘no’, it serves to . remind sexually active servicewomen that it might be wise to take a . pregnancy test. Pre-deployment guidelines and advice . issued to every soldier make clear that women troops should not deploy . if they are pregnant but at no time are women given a pregnancy test by . the MoD.","Between January 2006 and December 2013 99 servicewomen sent home .

"A leading public school is to give pupils lessons in ‘grit’ to help them emulate children in high-performing East Asian nations such as Singapore. Wellington College will encourage youngsters to adopt beliefs more commonly associated with so-called ‘tiger mothers’ – that ability is not fixed and hard work will eventually pay off. The Berkshire school – which charges boarding fees of £34,125 a year – aims to find the best way of teaching pupils to persevere in the face of academic setbacks, instead of assuming they are simply not clever enough. Wellington College in Berkshire, a leading public school which charges £34,125 boarding fees per year, will teach youngsters to adopt the belief ability is not fixed and hard work will eventually pay off . It has become known for adopting innovative approaches including ‘happiness’ lessons to boost pupils’ well-being and outlook on life. Working with a Harvard University researcher in a two-year project, pupils will be introduced to cutting-edge brain science which emphasises the role of effort and practice – rather than relying on innate talent. If successful, the initiative could be introduced in other schools. The lessons will aim to explode the widely-held view that only some children are born ‘smart’. Instead of giving up, they will be told that working hard will boost their abilities in areas they find difficult. Schools in countries such as Singapore, South Korea, China and Japan, which regularly top global league tables, are known to value hard work rather than focusing on natural ability. But experts warned youngsters should not be ‘drilled at all costs’. Project leader Dr Christina Hinton, of Harvard Graduate School of Education, said she believed it was right to encourage hard work, but that the approach ‘should be paired with compassion’. Dr Hinton said: ‘The results would show these countries excelling and they would also show that they adopt a growth mindset, that the harder you work the better you will do. ‘You’ll hear things like, “that’s such a beautiful project, you must have worked so hard” as opposed to “that’s such a beautiful project, you must be so bright or so talented or so smart”. ‘Right away, the cultural assumption is that if you did something very well then you worked very hard, as opposed to then you are talented. ‘Actually that is more accurate from a neuroscience point of view. Working really hard at something does develop your brain and your abilities. ‘It’s a really important concept and important to correct that misconception in pop culture and definitely with children.’ Dr Hinton said she believed tiger mothers were ‘right’ in their belief in encouraging hard work. But she added: ‘It should be paired with compassion. It’s good for students to work really hard but it’s important to really invest in things that they personally feel are important and interesting, not what someone’s forcing them to do. ‘If a student is really passionate about something themselves and they are working really hard, that’s the ideal case. They will be more what we call intrinsically motivated or internally motivated. I think it’s problematic if there’s too much pressure coming from external forces making them do things. ‘I do think it’s good to encourage hard work, but hard work toward their own personal goals and in the context of compassion. ‘Kids can’t just do what they want all the time, of course. But it needs to be a supportive environment, and for them not to be drilled at all costs, that’s not good education. ‘Some neuroscience shows that if your brain is too stressed in that way, it’s not as effective at learning. You really want to support them emotionally while you are supporting them to be hard workers, I think that’s important.’ The project is being carried out in conjunction with three local state schools and the techniques it develops could be adopted by schools around the country. It is one of the first to emerge from Wellington’s new educational research centre which was launched this month to eliminate ‘guesswork’ and ‘hunches’ from teaching practice. Tasks are likely to include spotting shortcuts around the school which have become well-trodden paths as more people have walked on them. ‘We use that as a metaphor for what’s happening in the brain - that the more you are using your circuits the more strengthened they are becoming,’ Dr Hinton added. ‘There are genetic contributions but the environment has a really powerful impact on the brain. Nothing is set in stone genetically.’ The moniker ‘tiger mother’ was popularised by US law professor Amy Chua who described how she chivvied her daughters to achieve academic and musical success Chinese-style in a best-selling guide which provoked fierce debate in Britain. The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, published in 2011, was described as ‘the story of my family’s journey in two cultures’.","Wellington College, Berkshire, will teach children that ability is not fixed .

"You'd think Prince Philip would go easy on the politically incorrect jokes when opening a new cardiac centre. After all, it was just over a year ago that the 91-year-old Royal had heart surgery after suffering chest pains. But the outspoken Prince proved he’s incorrigible at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, telling a Filipino nurse: ‘The Philippines must be half-empty – you’re all here running the NHS.’ Royal quip: The Duke of Edinburgh told this Filipino nurse at Luton and Dunstable University Hospital  her country must be 'half empty', because so many of her compatriots have come to the UK to work for the NHS . Are there any of you left? The 91-year-old joked with the Filipino nurse and her colleagues during a visit to Luton and Dunstable Hospital to open a new cardiac centre earlier today . The Prince made his remark as he opened a £5.5million facility on Tuesday. The nurse seemed to take his joke in good humour and laughed. The 91-year-old royal, who calls . himself 'the world's most experienced curtain puller',  asked when the hospital would . get a helipad to save him a journey by car. He had apparently been keen . to visit after undergoing heart surgery himself just over a year ago. As he visited the new cardiac centre, the Duke was presented with a gold plated coronary arterial stent - similar to the one used during his own surgery. ‘Ah - a spare, just in case!, ’ the smiling Duke quipped, before attempting to perform the procedure himself using the equipment on the new wing. Buckingham Palace said last night that it would not comment on a 'private conversation'. Royal sources insisted, however, that . the prince would never intend to cause offence and liked to make the odd . joke 'to put people at ease'. Happy greeting: Prince Philip shakes the hand of the Filipino nurse as he makes her giggle with his joke . On good form: The Duke of Edinburgh was in a 'jovial' mood and joked about the hospital installing a helipad to save him the car journey . Royal opening: The Duke of Edinburgh visited the hospital to unveil a £5.5million cardiac centre . 'It was a very jovial visit, with lots of laughing all round. The Duke was on very good form,' they said. The hospital spokesperson added: . 'Staff greatly enjoyed the opportunity to meet the Duke of Edinburgh. We . regard all conversations he had with our staff and guests as private . and therefore would not comment on them. 'Luton is a very cosmopolitan town and the working staff at Luton and Dunstable Hospital reflects that.' The latest figures suggest that 16,184 of the 670,000 nurses in the UK are from the Philippines – which has a population of 94.8million. Viewed by some as 'refreshingly open' but by others as somewhat politically incorrect, Prince Philip has . always possessed a propensity to shock. Last year the Duke followed tradition . as he walked past a pretty young woman in red and exclaimed 'I would . get arrested if I unzipped that dress!’ Prince . Phillip and the Queen were on a Royal visit to Bromley, Kent, when he . spotted 25-year-old Hannah Jackson, turned to the policeman standing . next to her and gestured towards her eye-catching zip-up dress. 'Do you still throw spears at each other?': The Duke of Edinburgh talks to Aboriginal performers after watching a culture show at Tjapukai Aboriginal Culture Park, Cairns, Queensland, Australia . Lady in red: As he walked past Bromley Council worker Hannah Jackson, 25, Prince Philip turned to a police officer and said: 'I would get arrested if I unzipped that dress!' Gaffe-prone: The Queen with the Duke of Edinburgh on a visit to St Loye's Foundation in Exeter in 2010 . Former Scottish Tory leader Annabel Goldie (left) was asked by the Duke of Edinburgh if she wore tartan knickers at a papal reception in 2009. And the prince was in a spot of bother again in 2001 after telling a 13-year-old Andrew Adams (right) he would need to lose weight if he wanted to be an astronaut . In 1986 he told British students in Peking: 'If you stay here much longer you'll all be slitty-eyed.' Seven years later, he told a Briton . living in Hungary: 'You can't have been here long. You've not got a pot . belly.' His remarks apparently alluded to the Hungarians' love of food . and drink. Closer to home, he caused a storm . while touring a factory in Edinburgh in August 1999 when he remarked . that a fuse box 'looked as though it had been put in by an Indian'. Again in Scotland, he outraged locals . when he asked a driving instructor he met on a walkabout in Oban in . 1995: 'How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to get them . past the test?'. His other foot-in-mouth remarks . include telling a group of teenagers from the British Deaf Association . in Cardiff who were standing near a loud Caribbean steel band: 'If . you're near that music it's no wonder you're deaf.' On February 11, the Duke of Edinburgh attended Sunday morning church Service at Sandringham Church, Norfolk, and left this policeman chuckling with an off-the-cuff comment that was not reported . Some of his off-the-cuff remarks have proved more amusing, however. When asked if he knew the Scilly Isles, off the coast of Cornwall, he joked: 'Yes, my son owns them.' And of his daughter, Princess Anne, he jested: 'If it doesn't fart or eat hay, she is not interested.' Phil Dampier author of Prince Philip: . Wise Words and Golden Gaffes said: 'This is a classic Prince Philip . comment. I have no doubt that he doesn't mean to offend and the nurse . took no offence. He makes these comments to break the ice and put people . at ease. 'That said, there is no doubt that . sometimes he does overstep the mark and people are genuinely taken aback . or upset by his comments.' Mr Dampier pointed out that when the . prince asked an islander in the Cayman Islands during a 1994 visit: . 'Aren't most of you descended from pirates?', the man appeared to be . genuinely offended. The Duke is well-known for his . outspoken comments, here are some of his most memorable: .","Philip was visiting Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, Bedfordshire .

"Last Saturday on the dot of her 11.15am appointment, a pretty young wife called Nela Molik went to see the doctor at a small surgery nestling in a parade of shops overlooking an enormous, noisy roundabout in West London. The 25-year-old was praying for good news: that her unborn child conceived five weeks ago is growing normally. Half an hour later, eyes shining with excitement, Nela emerged onto the pavement clutching a scan picture of the healthy baby which will be born next spring. It was a joyous moment for Nela and her 24-year-old husband, Lucasz. No trust in the NHS: Nela and Lucasz were happy with their Saturday morning scan . And all thanks to the surgery where last weekend, and every weekend, the doors were open wide for business. It’s open from 9am till 11pm six days a week — and from 9am till 6pm on Sundays. On Saturday, the gynaecologist at the My Medyk clinic in Hanger Lane treated 15 other patients as well as Nela, the last at 9pm. The previous Saturday, he was even busier when 20 women came to see him. Clinic Manager Radek Przypis in one of the three dental treatment rooms at the My Medyk Polish Clinic in Hanger Lane . As Nela, a private maternity nurse with impeccable English, who is settled in Britain, said as she proudly looked at the baby scan: ‘I think, personally, the NHS is rubbish. ‘They told me I could not have a scan until I had been pregnant for 12 weeks. ‘Three months is a long time to wait. Lucasz and I had a problem with a pregnancy in the past. I could not bear the worry of waiting to know if I was expecting again and all was well with this baby. ‘I am registered with a GP in North London where I live. But if you have an infection the doctors there hand out penicillin, which was on offer 30 years ago and has been replaced by more modern antibiotics. ‘Once, I went there and the GP looked at his computer and used the search engine Google to try to find out what was wrong with me. I do not trust the British state medical system.’ Among the English patients at My Medyk were Jannine Tasli, 25, a factory manager and her partner Scott Thomas, 32, an IT technician. They live in Northolt, West London, and heard of the surgery through a friend of a friend. Jannine is 25 weeks pregnant and the couple arrived just after 4pm for a scan of their unborn baby boy, due in three months. The couple had been worried because the pregnancy has been a difficult one. As Jannine explained, after the My Medyk scan showed her baby was thriving: ‘A mother is only allowed two scans on the NHS, at 12 and 21 weeks. ‘In our case, the first scan was delayed and it was at 14 weeks, which worried us. We wanted to have this one, at 25 weeks, to make sure all was well.’ Smiling and happy, she added: ‘During the scan I saw our baby boy put his fists up and wave his hands about. It is so exciting and such a relief for us.’ The My Medyk clinic offers a lifeline to patients forced to use over-burdened hospital casualty departments at weekends, evenings and night times because their GPs no longer work out of hours. It has another branch in Ealing, also in West London, and will soon open up in the east of the capital. Set up in 2008 by two Polish doctors, it has 6,000 Britons among the 30,000 patients on its books, all attracted by same-day GP and specialists’ appointments that last half an hour and cost £70 — far less than rival private medical services. There are family visit appointments: three patients including children for £190, ultrasound scans for £70, injections at £30 a time and stitches done by a surgeon for £45. The surgery’s motto is ‘put patients first’ and Radek Przypis, the manager, says the reason his doctors are so busy is that the NHS services are ‘so poor’. The facts are indeed dismal. Two thirds of NHS patients now have to wait 48 hours or more for a GP’s appointment and it is a rarity to find a local surgery open outside ordinary people’s working hours. As a crisis of cash, bad management — and even the threat of entire hospital closures — engulfs our once-proud state health service, the sick are turning to casualty departments in desperation, and in increasing numbers, finding them over-stretched with waiting times of four hours for one in every 18 patients. In a few alarming cases, the particularly vulnerable sick and old have died in ambulances waiting outside in queues. Mr Carmel Said, 63, (right) a sculpture and model maker for the theatre and TV and Julie Mess, 35, (left) a dancer working in the West End, who are both patients of My Medyk Clinic . A further problem for NHS patients is the waiting time to see a hospital specialist, because an appointment has to be authorised through a GP. The result? Some cancer sufferers don’t start treatment for two months after they first visit their doctor with suspected symptoms. This weekend the Labour Party claimed some life-saving checks in hospitals for cancer cases are also delayed because of increasing NHS chaos. No wonder, perhaps, that a new kind of private surgery offering quick appointments at a reasonable price is beginning to flourish. In central Manchester, the Green Surgery admits patients until 10pm seven days a week and will stay open until 3am if an emergency patient needs treatment. Kryzstof Zemlik, business development manager of the Green Surgery, also set up by Polish medics, said yesterday: ‘We offer appointments in a short time and they are a half an hour slot. If the examination takes longer, we let the appointment go on. The patient is the important thing to us. Now the English are coming to us too, as well as the Polish, Slovaks, Hungarians and Portuguese. ‘We are open every day of the year — the busiest are Saturday and Sunday when NHS GPs’ doors are closed. We have a lot of demand for gynaecology and dentistry. Gynecologist Grzegorz Pospiech talks about his medical practice in West London . State-of-the-art: Set up in 2008 by two Polish doctors, the clinic has 6,000 Britons among the 30,000 patients on its books . ‘We offer real quality and the cost is much less than many private medical clinics. We charge £60 for half an hour and if tests are needed we do them straight away.’ And back in London at My Medyk it is much the same story. I spent last Saturday talking to patients there. From early in the morning until the surgery closed, there was a stream of men and women, of all nationalities including English, Polish and Indian, arriving for appointments. Tomasz Ponk, a 32-year-old builder from Cricklewood, was at the clinic with earache soon after midday. ‘I got medication straight away when I saw the doctor,’ he told me as he left. ‘I feel completely confident with the treatment here and I am quite happy to pay because it is not too expensive.’ He first used the surgery a few years ago when he found a strange lump on his body that turned out to be a tumour — his life could have been in danger without swift treatment. ‘The surgery’s doctors acted very quickly. They sent me for a scan and the op was done at an NHS hospital, which I was very pleased with.’ Jannine Tasli, 25, a general manager and Scott Thomas, 32, an IT technician from Northolt at My Medyk . The My Medyk clinic offers a lifeline to patients forced to use over-burdened hospital casualty departments . Mr Ponk has an NHS surgery near his home. But he avoids it after a doctor prescribed antibiotics for his two-year-old daughter at dosage more suitable for an eight-year-old. ‘I was worried they would make her ill, not make her well,’ he said. Next through the door of My Medyk are some more Polish patients, Piotr, 37, a builder and Anna, 35, an accountant, from West Acton. They did not want to give their surnames because their family do not know that Anna is 12 weeks pregnant and has been worried about her symptoms. Anna turned to the surgery, ‘because the NHS casualty departments are so busy at weekends and to see a local doctor takes weeks’. Piotr adds: ‘We rang to see the gynaecologist here when Anna was concerned about the pregnancy. ‘We asked for an appointment today and got it immediately. Now the doctor has told us there is nothing wrong so we are relieved and happy.’ Yet another delighted customer. But that’s not surprising with the NHS in such deep trouble. One . particular attraction of My Medyk and the Green Surgery is that — . mimicking medical systems in Eastern Europe — a patient can book an . appointment directly with a specialist doctor without the often . grindingly slow process of being referred by a GP at an NHS surgery. Dr . Grzegorz Pospiech the busy 58-year-old gynaecologist who treated so . many patients on Saturday and who came to My Medyk in 2009 put it . simply: ‘We follow the Polish way here — the patient can go straight to . see a specialist without having to go through a GP or have lots of . appointments beforehand. It helps to stop a patient worrying and he gets . the right treatment fast.’ The surgery’s manager Radek Przypis added: ‘All patients want is to come to one surgery that they know and get treatment fast from a doctor that they trust.’ If only the beleaguered NHS could provide the same level of service — for all our sakes.","My Medyk clinic in West London is opened seven days a week .

"Ed Miliband has been accused of showing 'contempt' for voters after his polling guru, James Morris, said Labour's anti-immigration views 'depressed' him . Ed Miliband was last night accused of displaying contempt for voters after his polling guru said their anti-immigration views made him ‘depressed’. James Morris made a series of scornful remarks after holding a focus group meeting intended to help  the party devise Election-winning policies on the issue. Mr Morris, a key member of the Labour leader’s strategy unit, dismissed the views of those present  as ‘fill jobs with Brits’. His outburst reflects tensions among Mr Miliband’s team over immigration. The party is haunted by claims that the last Labour Government  was responsible for mass immigration from Eastern Europe – and divided over whether Mr Miliband should take a stronger line. Mr Morris, a former No 10 adviser to Tony Blair at the time of the ‘open-door’ policy, used the social-networking website Twitter to announce on Monday evening: ‘Recipe for a miserable evening:  off to do focus groups on immigration.’ And afterwards, he wrote, in a line dripping with sarcasm: ‘Tonight’s focus groups as progressive as  I hoped,’ adding: ‘Their plan: end migration and fill jobs with Brits who have to take job.’ He declared that it had left him ‘depressed, as you might imagine’. The liberal views on immigration of many of Labour’s frontbenchers are not shared by most voters. In a recent opinion poll,  72 per cent of respondents favoured slamming the door on unskilled immigrants, while 59 per cent thought we should allow fewer relatives of people already living in Britain into the country to join them. The findings forced Mr Miliband to announce that, if he wins the next Election, he will introduce measures to help British workers. Tory MP said Labour 'want to censor and shut down any sensible and rational debate' on immigration . Last night, Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi said of Mr Morris’s remarks: ‘This shows the contempt Labour and Ed Miliband have for the public. They don’t want to hear people’s views about immigration. 'Instead they want to censor and shut down any sensible and rational debate on an extremely important subject. ‘It’s the same old Labour. Anyone who doesn’t share their world view is mocked and attacked.’ A spokesman for Ed Miliband declined to comment.","James Morris is a key member of Ed Miliband's strategy unit .

"His first-person account of a 19th-century massacre in Africa helped to close one of the continent's most notorious slave markets. But researchers now believe legendary explorer Dr David Livingstone may not have been telling the whole truth. Using a procedure known as spectral imaging, an international team of academics believe they have decoded his long-illegible field diary and say it hints that his own men may have participated in the atrocity. Hidden account: Dr Livingstone's 1871 field diary was written using bank checks, aging pieces of newsprint ink made from seeds and berries, rendering it illegible until it was recently analysed with a spectrograph (below) Untruths uncovered? Researchers claim that discrepancies between Dr Livingstone's original account of the massacre and the field diary suggests he has something to hide about the atrocity . Adrian Wisnicki of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, who directed the project, said: 'Livingstone's party might have been involved in the massacre.' But he advised caution: 'We're only beginning to analyze the evidence.' It's an explosive claim because Livingstone's account of the horror seen in the African village of Nyangwe galvanized British authorities to shut the slave market in Zanzibar, a critical hub for East Africa's human traffickers. Livingstone himself denied allegations that his men had been involved. And while Livingstone biographer Tim Jeal praised Wisnicki's efforts, he said he was skeptical that the Scottish missionary would have tried to cover up his party's role in the killings. 'Nobody can know for sure, but I don't think the proof is there,' Mr Jeal said. Regardless of the exact circumstances, the Nyangwe massacre was one of the darkest points of Livingstone's career. In his posthumously published 'Last Journals,' Livingstone described how a 'bright, sultry summer morning' in July 1871 had turned to hell when slavers opened fire on some 1,500 people at Nyangwe's market. Horror: An illustration of the Massacre of the Manyuema Women at Nyangwe in which slavers opened fire on 1,500 people at a market in Zanzibar. The atrocity was one of the darkest points of Dr Livingstone's career . Pandemonium broke out as the marketgoers, many of them women, scrambled for their canoes or tried to swim across the nearby Lualaba River. 'Shot after shot continued to be fired on the helpless and perishing,' Livingstone said, describing how many others drowned in the river. 'Some of the long line of heads disappeared quietly; whilst other poor creatures threw their arms high, as if appealing to the great Father above, and sank.' Livingstone said he couldn't know how many had died, although he cited estimates running into the hundreds. When news of the massacre reached Britain, it ignited a wave of revulsion. By 1873, the British consul had pressured the sultan of Zanzibar to close the island's large slave market. Livingstone's account was first communicated to the outside world by journalist Henry Stanley, whose famous encounter with the explorer in October 1871 was immortalized by the words: 'Dr Livingstone, I presume?' Later works, including the 'Last . Journals', were based on the journal that Livingstone wrote in 1872, . after Stanley had resupplied him with paper. Famous meeting: Dr Livingstone's account was first relayed to the world by journalist Henry Stanley, whose encounter with the explorer in October 1871 was immortalised by the phrase: 'Dr Livingstone, I presume?' But it's Livingstone's field diary, improvised from bank checks and aging pieces of newsprint and written in ink made from seeds and berries, which Wisnicki claims as evidence for his theory that Livingstone's men were involved in the massacre. The raw notes have long been considered unreadable - a result of the unusual writing material, the tropical weather, and the unorthodox ink. But Wisnicki's team submitted the notes to spectrographic analysis. The field diary makes clear that Livingstone - an ardent abolitionist - was horrified by the moral character of the freed slaves sent to reinforce his expedition. He describes them as 'senseless slaves with no honor.' In Livingstone's account, they emerge as rebellious and violent - at one point he confides that 'if they go anywhere, I must go with them or murder is certain.' In another passage, dated May 18, Livingstone says the slaves have mutinied and bought guns with his money. Those passages were either sanitized or excised from Livingstone's 1872 journal. Wisnicki claimed that the edits, combined with discrepancies between the field diary and the journal's descriptions of the massacre, suggest Livingstone may have had something to hide about the bloody incident. Mr Jeal acknowledged that the slaves were 'clearly very disobedient and violent men,' but said it was unlikely that they would have gone on a rampage in Livingstone's presence. Followers of the great explorer can decide for themselves. Scans and transcripts of the diary have been posted to the website of the University of California, Los Angeles.","Report of 19th-century atrocity led to closure of slave market in Africa .

"Running back Chris Rainey, who has a history of domestic violence, has become the second player to be cut by Arizona Cardinals in just two days . The Arizona Cardinals have released a second player accused of domestic violence in just two days. The team announced on Thursday that running back Chris Rainey had been released from its practice squad. The decision to cut Rainey, who has a history of domestic violence, follows the arrest of running back Jonathan Dwyer on aggravated assault charges on Wednesday. Rainey was a fifth-round pick of the Steelers in 2012, but he was cut by the team after his rookie season when he was accused of slapping his girlfriend. He later pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct. Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer head-butted his wife and broke her nose after she refused to have sex with him, and punched her in the face the next day, police revealed today. The sordid details surfaced in a law enforcement report a day after Dwyer was arrested on aggravated assault charges and deactivated from all team activities. He spent a night in jail and made a brief court appearance before being released early Thursday. Dwyer, 25, was arrested Wednesday for investigation in two altercations that occurred on July 21 and 22 at his Phoenix residence, just days before the Cardinals reported to training camp. His wife, 27-year-old Kayla Tobin Dwyer, left the state after the incidents, but came forward a week ago after Dwyer apparently sent suicidal text messages including a photo of a knife. In the first encounter, police say Dwyer attempted to kiss and undress his wife, but she refused. Someone who heard the argument reported the assault to police, who showed up at the apartment but did not make an arrest. Dwyer hid in a bathroom and the wife denied he was in the home because the running back threatened to kill himself in front of her and their child if she told police about the assault, police said. Scroll down for video . Domestic violence: Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer (far right) is accused of beating up his wife, Kayla (center) for refusing to have sex with him and throwing a shoe at their young son (pictured) The next day, Dwyer punched his wife with a closed fist on the left side of her face, according to police. He also punched walls and threw a shoe at his 17-month-old son, who was not injured. As Kayla Dwyer tried to call police, Dwyer grabbed her cellphone and threw it down from the home's second story. Witnesses told police that Dwyer's wife said, ‘I'm calling the police’ as she held her swollen face and clutched her son. During his police interview, Dwyer acknowledged hiding in the bathroom when police responded to the first argument and sending a photo of a knife with suicidal threats. Dwyer denied committing an assault, though he acknowledged that he punched walls in his home, threw a phone and that his wife bit his lip during the disputes, according to the police report. As he was released from jail Thursday, he said he never hurt his son. Arrested: Dwyer was arrested Wednesday on aggravated assault charges in connection with two altercations at his home in July involving his family . Jonathan Dwyer was released from jail at around 5am Thursday after posting a $25,000 cash bond. When asked by a gaggle of reporters if he will ever play football again, he simply replied: 'I will,' according to KPHO. Dwyer was ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device and banned from having contact with his wife and so; he also cannot travel outside Arizona or be in possession of weapons, drugs or alcohol. Authorities depicted a stormy relationship between Dwyer and his wife, a flight attendant from North Carolina, that escalated into violence on July 21, four days before the Cardinals reported to training camp. Neighbors heard a fight and called police, who showed up at the residence but left without making an arrest because Dwyer hid in the bathroom and the woman said no one else was at the home, Sgt. Trent Crump told the Associated Press. 'She said she was in an argument on the phone only,' Crump said. '[Police officers] were convinced that the fight was verbal [and] that it was called in by a third party,' Crump also told AZ Central. '[The 27-year-old woman] convinced them of that while he was hiding in the home.' Handcuffed: Phoenix police officers escort Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer,  to the 4th Avenue Jail following his arrest on Wednesday . The Cardinals released a statement Wednesday saying 'We became aware of these allegations this afternoon when notified by Phoenix police and are cooperating fully. 'Given the serious nature of the allegations we have taken the immediate step to deactivate Jonathan from all team activities. 'We will continue to closely monitor this as it develops and evaluate additional information as it becomes available.' Hot temper: Dwyer denied committing an assault or hurting his son, though he acknowledged that he punched walls in his home . The NFL said the case will be reviewed under the league's personal-conduct policy. The NFL has been rocked by domestic violence issues ever since a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator. Then Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson was indicted on felony child-abuse charges. On Wednesday, the Carolina Panthers decided that star defensive end Greg Hardy will not play any more games for the team until his domestic violence case is resolved. Hardy was convicted of assault on a female and communicating threats after the victim said the 6-foot-4, 275-pound player threw her in the bathtub and onto a sofa covered with guns before threatening to kill her. Hardy is appealing the ruling. Critics have been calling for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's resignation for his handling of Rice's case. Rice was originally suspended for two games, then banned indefinitely after the video surfaced of his attack in the casino elevator. This is the second domestic violence case involving a Cardinals player. Inside linebacker Daryl Washington pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend and is serving a year of supervised probation. Washington has not yet been penalized by the NFL for the offense but is suspended for this season for violating the league's substance abuse policy. Sidelined: The Cardinals deactivated Jonathan Dwyer from all team activities following his arrest . Athlete: Dwyer, 25, signed with the Cardinals earlier this year and was their second-string running back after spending the last four years with the Pittsburgh Steelers . Dwyer was led into the jail in handcuffs to be booked on counts that include aggravated assault causing a fracture and involving a minor, criminal damage and preventing the use of a phone in an emergency. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, which runs the jail, said Dwyer has refused all media interviews. Dwyer signed with the Cardinals this year and was their second-string running back after spending the last four seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He scored a touchdown last week in Arizona's victory over the New York Giants. His best year for Pittsburgh was 2012 when injuries depleted the team's backfield in the middle of the season and Dwyer filled in and had 100-yard-plus games in consecutive weeks. Dwyer, from Marietta, Georgia, was a sixth-round draft pick of the Steelers out of Georgia Tech in 2010.","Running back Chris Rainey has become the second player to be cut by Arizona Cardinals in just two days .

"Half of adults with autism have been abused by someone they know, a new study has found amid warnings of the 'devastating scale' of neglect and abuse. Many people diagnosed with the condition are staying at home because they are afraid of being abused or harrassed, the National Autistic Society (NAS) said today. People with autism can find it hard to interpret other people's motivations and as a result can be taken advantage of or manipulated, the charity said. Half of the 1,300 sufferers questioned by NAS said they had been abused by someone they considered a friend. A survey by the National Autistic Society found half of the 1,300 adults surveyed had been abused by someone they considered to be a friend . Thirty-seven per cent said they had been manipulated to do something they did not want to by these so-called friends, while 44 per cent said fear of abuse or harrassment led them to not wanting to leave the house. Meanwhile a quarter of those polled said they have had their money or possessions stolen. The charity said the survey also revealed many adults with the condition feel they are being neglected. Two thirds said they require someone to prompt them to wash, dress or feed themselves. But seven in 10 of these sufferers said they had missed meals because they don't get this support while 86 per cent said they had not washed. NAS raised concerns that changes to the care system could mean this kind of neglect could become more commonplace. A spokesman said that the Government's proposals suggest that people will be eligible for care and support if they need 'assistance', which may not necessarily include prompting. Mark Lever, chief executive of NAS, said: 'These alarming figures paint a depressing picture of the horrendous abuse and neglect experienced by many adults with autism. 'We have heard deeply distressing stories of men and women living in utterly intolerable conditions, exploited physically and financially by supposed friends or unable to care for themselves without support. 'One professional told us of a man who had been found at home suffering from severe malnutrition and with mould growing on his skin as he was unable to feed or clean himself without prompting. 'This is utterly unacceptable in 21st century Britain. 'We know that many people with autism are able to live relatively independent lives, but many others need support to stay safe and healthy. 'The Government's changes to the care system offer a chance to support these at-risk individuals. The research also discovered many adults with the condition feel they are being neglected. The charity warned of the 'devastating scale' of abuse and neglect . 'However, we are incredibly concerned that the current proposals as they stand do not recognise the basic needs of these more vulnerable people with autism. 'It's not too late. The eligibility criteria must be revised so that they explicitly recognise the support needs of those at risk of abuse and neglect and protect some of the most vulnerable people in society.' A Department of Health spokeswoman . said: 'Until now it's been hard for people who need care and their . carers to know if they are eligible for care and support from their . council and this has varied depending on where they live. 'Our . national eligibility criteria will make the system fairer by clearly . setting out what level of needs must be met by all local authorities, . putting an end to this variation. 'These alarming figures paint a depressing picture of the horrendous abuse and neglect experienced by many adults with autism' - Mark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society . 'This consultation makes it clear that people with autism, whatever their level of need, will receive help from their councils. 'Those with lower needs will receive information and advice on what services and support are available locally to help them. 'And our minimum £3.8 billion Better Care Fund to join up health and social care will focus on helping people to live independently and prevent them from needing more support in the first place.' The NAS added: 'The Government’s draft regulations would provide national criteria for all local authorities which will be helpful, but our over-riding concern is their failure to provide the necessary clarity about who local authorities should support. 'They do not explicitly commit to supporting those people with autism who are at risk of abuse and neglect. Their eligibility for support must be made clear, otherwise local authorities will be able to interpret the criteria as they see fit. 'These vulnerable individuals do not have ‘lower needs’. The people who responded to our survey had terrible experiences; in the most concerning cases, this neglect and abuse had spiralled out of control and ultimately led to death. ‘Information and advice alone will not be enough to protect these at-risk individuals falling into crisis. 'Local authorities must be obliged to provide the direct support we know people with autism need in the first instance to stay safe and healthy.'","Survey by the National Autistic Society questioned 1,300 adults with autism .

"Adrian Peterson's mother defended the Minnesota Vikings running back in the wake of child abuse allegations against him, saying that he is 'trying hard to be a good parent'. Bonita Jackson of Spring, Texas, said she and Peterson's father, Nelson Peterson, were 'big disciplinarians' who used hands, switches and belts to occasionally spank all six of her children.

'Nike in no way condones child abuse or domestic violence of any kind and has shared our concerns with the NFL,' the apparel giant said in a statement. Nike is the latest company to distance itself from Peterson and the Vikings after the former NFL MVP was arrested over the weekend on charges he severely whipped his four-year-old son with a wooden switch. The boy had wounds on his thighs, backside and even his genitals following the beating. Peterson was suspended for one game by the Vikings but was allowed back onto the team despite his actions plunging the NFL into a fresh crisis over domestic abuse, following the Ray Rice controversy.

'Tough love': Friends of Peterson told how his mother, Bonita, and father, Nelson, used corporal punishment to discipline the running back.

On Wednesday, Vikings owners backtracked on their decision to allow him back on the field and admitted it was a 'mistake' to announce on Monday that he would be allowed to play again. Peterson must stay away from the team until after his trial on felony abuse charges - though he will still collect his $700,00-a-game salary. We made a mistake. In the end, we are getting it right,' Vikings co-owner Mark Wilf said at a press conference today. 'We have to make sure that our reputation, and the team, was moving in the right direction.' The Vikings placed Peterson on the 'exempt/commissioner's permission' list, effectively booting him from the roster - finally bowing to pressure from outraged fans and fleeing sponsors. Nike stores in the Twin Cities pulled all of their Adrian Peterson jerseys from shelves on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Minneapolis-based Target announced its stores were pulling his jerseys, as well. Castrol Motor Oil was the first of Peterson's major sponsors to drop him, announcing on Tuesday that the contract was suspended. On Monday, Radisson Hotels said it was suspending its endorsement deal with the Vikings after owners allowed Peterson back on the field following his arrest. Corporal punishment is legal in Texas but is a felony offense if it is too severe. Above, police released these images of Peterson's son' wounds . At a press conference on Wednesday, Radisson's logo - normally ubiquitous - was noticeably absent. Some of the NFL's top corporate sponsors like Anheuser-Busch, Visa and McDonald's, had also voiced disapproval over the league's treatment of its player scandals - including the decision to allow Peterson to continue to play. Peterson was pictured on Tuesday leaving his Minnesota home to join his teammates for practice. But the Vikings announced it was reversing its decision the following day after a time of 'further reflection' on the issues surrounding the case. Peterson's high school football coach weighed into the furor on Wednesday, revealing how he used to beat the star player when he misbehaved - and claimed he was thanked by him afterwards. Booker Bowie said that the Minnesota Vikings running back would get up to three lashes with an 18 inch long wooden paddle he kept in his office as part of what he called 'tough love'. But afterwards rather than crying or complaining to his parents, Peterson would simply say: 'Coach, thank you', said Bowie. 'Adrian understands corporal punishment...it's not intended to hurt anybody, it's to get them going in the right direction. I have never had a problem with parents calling anyone complaining. 'The way Adrian came up, his parents, his mother was disciplining him. He understands it, it helped his team mates, his classmates. I think that’s what he was doing (to his son).' Bowie said: 'His intention was not to abuse the kid. He understands corporal punishment and I don't think his intention was to abuse the kid. 'We all sometimes make mistakes, not intentionally. He just needs to move on from it. I think he's suffered enough. I think he's learned from this'.

"Parents have condemned a school's decision to ban all pork products from the menu and replace other meats with halal versions. Pupils aged between three and 11 at Brinsworth Manor Infant and Junior Schools in Rotherham - which Ofsted identifies as having only a small number of pupils from minority ethnic groups - will no longer be able to enjoy sausages, bacon or ham. Parents at both schools, which share a site, were told of the decision in a letter from . Rotherham Council’s principal catering officer Ron Parry, who wrote that there had . been ‘minor adjustments’ to the lunch menu. Although just 20 per cent of the school's 600 pupils are Muslim the menu changes were reportedly brought in to make the school more inclusive . Parents were told of the decision in a letter from Rotherham Council¿s principal catering officer Ron Parry, who wrote that there had been ¿minor adjustments¿ to the lunch menu . The move comes as Britain's vet John Blackwell called for Muslims and Jews to use more 'acceptable' methods of killing. And parents have branded the decision 'a scandal' as only twenty per cent of the 600 pupils are Muslim and the decision to provide halal meat was up to individual schools in the town. A mother with an 11-year-old girl at the school, who asked not to be named for fear of being branded racist, said: 'At home I pay more for organic and free range food. I am a . Christian but I don’t do it because of that, it’s more for the respect . of how animals are killed. 'The way the animals are slaughtered for halal meat is a religious killing and I don’t feel it should be in schools. 'My . daughter has been anxious about the change as she has concerns about if . it is humane killing. I believe in animal welfare rights and standards . of meat production that halal does not follow. The school governors at both schools are understood to have agreed to the menu change to ensure the meals are more inclusive . 'I . feel as strongly against eating meat that had been blessed in the name . of a god I don’t believe in and the animal killed in a way I do not . agree with, as Muslims do against eating non-halal meat. 'The . children love pork and it’s a scandal to take these meats off the menu . to please, what I consider to be, a low number of children who require . halal meat. 'The majority of . the children are now having school meals that are made for the minority. The halal children have always had the vegetarian and fish options. ' Another mum of a son at the school said she believed that halal slaughtering was cruel. She added : 'My son is a really fussy eater and pork is his favourite meat. He’ll get bored having chicken all the time.' A mother of two said parents who do not know much about halal meat had not been given enough information or time to understand it. She said : 'Normally the school is good at consulting parents but with this we have just been told what is going to happen. 'I’d want to know more about halal meat before I’d be happy for my children to eat it. I’ve been told it is not as well refrigerated. 'It would have been good to have know what Muslim parents thought and if they were unhappy with the vegetarian option on the menu.' Halal slaughter is performed by a Muslim butcher in the name of Allah in a way to avoid severing the spinal cord.

She said: 'The provision of both halal and non-halal is not unusual in Rotherham's school. Currently, nine schools out of 115, select one of our menus that provide a mix of both halal and non-halal meals. 'All meat on our menus, including halal, is sourced from reputable companies, which fully comply with the quality standards of the relevant individual meat boards. 'The meals are also nutritionally balanced and cooked fresh on-site every day using locally sourced meat, fruit, vegetables and dairy products where possible. 'Our menus are designed to meet both national nutritional standards and dietary requirements so that all the children of Rotherham benefit.'

"Schools in Bradford are fighting alleged Trojan Horse style plots after two teachers left their jobs while a third fears being 'driven' out as David Cameron vows to clear the classrooms of 'Islamism'. The plot involves ousting moderate headteachers from schools, and is also feared to have taken place in Birmingham, Manchester and parts of east London. Faisal Khan, a former member of George Galloway's Respect party was accused of being behind the alleged plot in Bradford, where one of the heads described herself as the victim of an 'attempted coup'. Faisal Khan, a former member of George Galloway's Respect party was accused of being behind the plot in Bradford, where one of the heads described herself as the victim of an 'attempted coup' At another secondary school in Bradford the local council dismissed every governor as it tried to tackle the issue. News of events in Bradford comes after the National Association of Head Teachers . said it had ‘serious concerns’ about attempts to ‘alter the character’ of at least six schools in Birmingham, and warned efforts to infiltrate classrooms were likely to be affecting other major towns and cities. According to the Sunday Telegraph Mr Khan, who was formerly a councillor with Respect but who now sits independently, was seen in a video clip revealing how he and his colleagues have been working to change headteacher at Bradford schools. 'We have to do that for every single school… we have to be there, on governing bodies, because that’s what it’s all about… It’s time we took these schools back,' he reportedly said. Mr Khan has maintained that his desire to remove head teachers was to improve standards, and said he was not seeking to 'Islamise' schools . However, Mr Khan has maintained that his desire to remove head teachers was to improve standards, and said he was not seeking to 'Islamise' schools. His group, the Bradford Muslim Education Forum (BMEF) has links to alleged plotters who have sought to bring in more conservative Islamic practices at Birmingham schools. The group has run events in Bradford involving alleged Birmingham plotter Tahir Alam, who heads the governing body at the city's Park View school, where it is claimed pupils freely praise terrorism, are segregated by gender, and are taught women . must obey their husbands. Park View has denied the allegations, and said the idea it supports terrorism is ‘abhorrent’. Mr Alam's contact details were reportedly distributed at a BMEF meeting against teaching sex education in schools, and another meeting was run in conjunction with the al-Hijrah Training Academy - which he also runs. The Bradford Muslim Education Forum has run events involving alleged Birmingham plotter Tahir Alam, who heads the governing body at the city's Park View school . Speakers at BMEF meetings have also included Razwan Faraz, the deputy head of Nansen Primary School in Birmingham, which has been visited by Ofsted inspectors investigating the alleged plots, Nansen's chairman of governors Shahid Akmal, and Achmad da Costa - the chairman of governors at Oldknow Academy - where a successful non-Muslim head was allegedly driven from her post. BMEF head Mr Khan is chairman of governors at Carlton Bolling College in Bradford, a secular school where many pupils are Muslim. He had been on the governing body at Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College until every member was sacked by Bradford council following fears over poor performance and a 'dysfunctional' relationships between the governors and management. Staff at both schools claimed Mr Khan was behind attacks aimed at driving out headteachers. Faisal Khan was elected to serve on Bradford city council in May 2012 when he stood for George Galloway's Respect party, vowing to put educational accountability high on his agenda and lift Bradford schools up the national league tables. However, in August 2013 he and four other councillors resigned the Respect party whip, claiming Galloway had accused them of attempting to sabotage the party. The row was sparked when Mr Galloway, Respect MP for Bradford West, revealed he was considering running for Mayor of London in 2016, prompting the councillors to suggest he should quit as MP were he to do so. Mr Khan now sits as councillor for the Bradford Moor ward as an independent, and serves on the council's Children's Services Overview and Scrutiny Committee. Last . January former Carlton Bolling head Chris Robinson left the role in the . middle of the school year, despite having recently been announced as . runner-up in the secondary head teacher of the year category in the Pearson National Teaching Awards. Ms . Robinson has not commented on the Trojan Horse claims but after moving . to another school in Rotherham gave a presentation about her tenure at . Carlton Bolling, saying in the talk on February 21 last year that people . had been working against her. She went on to say how important it was to remain 'absolutely focused, even when dementors attempt a coup,' referencing evil characters from the Harry Potter books. Mr Khan has insisted he had not driven out Ms Robinson, and said she had taken another job. He added that he had clashed with her over a contract for the school's human resources services, and said she had not got three quotes for the work, as laid out in Department for Education rules. Mr Khan reportedly admitted being involved in removing Jackie Nellis, who was head before Ms Robinson and was head when the school received an 'outstanding' Ofsted rating. He said she had not delivered good enough GCSE results at the school. Mr Khan was also accused of attempting to undermine current Laisterdyke head teacher Jen McIntosh, with one source at the school saying tactics used were similar to those used in Trojan Horse plots as governors were questioning decisions and results. Mr Khan denied any 'Islamist' takeover but said he had argued with Ms McIntosh as she had not hired enough permanent staff. Under investigation: Park View school, pictured above, is being investigated over the plot - which headteachers fear could spread . He said the governors had been removed for holding the head to account. 'This . is the head teacher removing the governing body, not the other way . round. It’s more like a Trojan donkey than a Trojan horse,' he said. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to erase extremism from schools, saying his is concerned about the alleged plots. 'I don't want to see Islamist entryism into our schools. That is a very worrying development,' he told the Sunday Times. 'We will not have extremism, entryism, Islamism in our schools.' Russell Hobby, NAHT general secretary, said some teachers were being appointed because of their Muslim faith rather than their skills. Lindsey Clark, former head of Park View, resigned this month after being reduced to a 'figurehead' with no real control over her school, a Department for Education probe found . There was also evidence of ‘pressure’ being brought to bear on heads to adopt ‘certain philosophies and approaches’. Speaking . ahead of the union’s annual conference in Birmingham, he said: ‘We . ourselves have concerns about what has been going on in and around half a . dozen of those schools. ‘There have been things going on inside our schools which would make some of us feel uncomfortable.’ Meanwhile, . it has been claimed that dozens of teachers pushed out of schools by an . alleged Islamist takeover plot are too afraid to speak out because of . gagging orders. Birmingham . MP Khalid Mahmood said at least ten teachers told him they were made to . sign agreements offering cash in return for their silence. Mr . Mahmood said: ‘A lot of people are still not speaking, even in private, . because they are frightened of what may happen. They think if they come . forward they will lose their pay-off or pensions and are worried they . will then not be able to teach.’ Noshaba Hussain, a moderate Muslim former headmistress of Springfield Primary, was forced out of her job by a ‘well-organised and sinister’ group of extremists more than 20 years ago. The 69-year-old told the Mail she was made to sign a confidentiality agreement, or ‘gag’, that threatened to withdraw her pay-off of a few months’ salary if she spoke to the press. She claimed false rumours were spread about her by the Muslim governing body until she was sacked by Birmingham education chiefs for what was described as a ‘loss of faith and trust in the head by the governing body’. ‘It was all done through my union,’ she said. ‘I was told if I spoke to the press about what happened to me I would have to return the money.’ A source from one of the schools affected said: ‘A lot of teachers who leave are being bullied and harassed. The threat of taking away a reference can be worse than a monetary threat as they are worried their career will be affected.’","Former Respect councillor accused of being behind Bradford plots .

"A former Defense Department spokesman is calling out the Obama administration for giving terrorists better medical treatment than its giving the nation's veterans. In an opinion piece on FoxNews.com today, Defense Department alumni J.D. Gordon claims, 'Al Qaeda terrorists at Guantanamo treated better than our vets.' 'Yes, it’s true. I know because I served as a Pentagon spokesman from . 2005-2009 and visited Guantanamo Bay Naval Base over 30 times during . those years,' he writes. Former Pentagon Spokesman J.D. Gordon, left, says the suspected terrorists being held at U.S. military facilities in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are provided with better medical care than America's veterans. Gordon is pictured here at the U .S. Naval Base at Gitmo on July 15, 2009 . In this photo, then-Pentagon Spokesman J.D. Gordon, right, walks with courtroom sketch artist Janet Hamlin, left, CNN's Carol Cratty, center, and U.S. military personnel on the way to the courthouse for a U.S. Military Commissions hearing at Camp Justice, the site of the U.S. war crimes tribunal compound, at Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base, Cuba on July 15, 2009 . Gordon is a retired Navy commander who served as a  Defense Department spokesman under both presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. After departing the Pentagon, he entered the realm of politics. In 2012 he served as an adviser to pizza magnate Herman Cain's bid for the Republican presidential nomination. He is now a national security and foreign policy commentator and a Senior Fellow and Communications Adviser to several right-leaning organizations in Washington, D.C. He is also the Executive Director of a national security-based conservative political action committee called Protect America Today that he helped found in 2012. In his op-ed on Fox's website, Gordon calls on the nation's Commander-in-Chief to 'refocus his priorities' on America's veterans and spend 'less time, effort and energy caring for Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees . at Gitmo and much more attention put on caring for America's veterans.' His op-ed points to a Joint Task Force Guantanamo fact sheet on Detainee Medical Care as evidence that the approximately 150 terrorists at Gitmo are taken care of by 100 health care providers. 'Doctors and medical personnel are at their beck and call,' Gordon writes. 'Got a . cold, a fever, a toothache, a tumor, chest or back pain, mental health . issues, PTSD? No problem, come right in. Military doctors are waiting to see you.' The Joint Task Force Guantanamo fact sheet claims the 'medical care provided to detainees at Guantanamo is consistent with what U.S. service members receive.' 'JMG providers administer care to all detainees regardless of disciplinary status, level of cooperation or legal status,' it says. 'Detainees are treated at dedicated medical facilities with state-of-the-art equipment and an expert medical staff.' The one-pager also notes that health services are available to suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay 'around the clock, seven days a week. Meanwhile, only one doctor is provided for every 35 veterans enrolled in the Veterans Affairs health care program and the VA's 267,930 employees, Gordon writes. 'If any government entity ever needed a complete overhaul, it’s the . VA,' he says. 'If it were in the private sector, it would have been shuttered long . ago.' Gordon argues that both presidents Bush and Obama allowed the VA to spiral out of control, citing VA officials' big salaries, big bonuses and big budgets for decorating, but zeros in on the current office holder for sitting on his hands for the last five and half years. 'Instead of fixing the problem' with veterans' care, the Obama's administration's ' focus was closing Guantanamo . and improving the comfort of detainees. Even though they already lived . under some of the best prison conditions ever seen.' Gordon, who is a veteran himself, says the government ought to be giving its countrymen and women who fought in uniform the same level of medical care than its giving to assumed terrorists. 'Our veterans have served the nation proudly. In many cases they were . gravely wounded during their service and now will require a lifetime of . medical support. Every one of them deserves better.'","J.D. Gordon is a former Pentagon spokesman who served under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama .

"Boko Haram, the African Islamist terror group whose April kidnapping of nearly 300 young girls has united the civilized world in anger, promised to assassinate U.S. ambassador to Nigeria Terence McCulley in February 2012, vowing to murder him if America signed a terrorism-fighting Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) with the government in Abuja. McCulley, now the U.S. ambassador to Ivory Coast, was not harmed. But the threat, coming amid a years-long bombing campaign that killed more than 1,400 Nigerian civilians, didn't move then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to fast-track the addition of Boko Haram to the U.S. government's official list of international terrorist groups. Independent media outlets inside Nigeria first reported on February 9, 2012 that an unnamed Boko Haram leader issued a statement promising that 'we will murder the U.S. Ambassador if the MOU is signed.' The revelation provides a stark parallel with assassination warnings issued by Islamist groups in Benghazi, Libya in the months before the September 11, 2012 attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other American personnel. Scroll down for video . In 2011 and 2012 the Islamist terror group Boko Haram detonated a bomb nearly every day for 15 months, including this December 2011 blast at St. Theresa Catholic Church outside the Nigerian capital Abuja . Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (L) met with Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan (R), Nigerian ambassador to the U.S. Ade Adefuye (2nd L) and Nigerian Foreign Minister Olugbenga Ashiru (2nd R) in Abuja on August 9, 2012, but despite threats to U.S. interests she refused to declare Boko Haram a terrorist group . In June of that year, Ansar al-Shariah – the al-Qaeda-linked group that carried out the Benghazi attack – held a parade, two days of rallies and a press conference in central Benghazi. With dozens of military vehicles and heavy arms on display, the terrorists held what an intelligence analyst later said was 'a team pep rally before the game, only for jihad.' The Clinton State Department infamously ignored that event, even though the first attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi followed two days later – a bombing at the compound's gate that left a hole big enough for 40 men to walk through. Later requests for additional armed guards at the Benghazi station also fell on deaf ears. Ansar al-Shariah ultimately returned to finish the job. A September 2013 report from the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee ominously speculated that McCulley's fate in Nigeria could be the same as Stevens' in Libya. 'The danger that Boko Haram may try a similar assault on diplomatic personnel there, as they [Ansar al-Shariah] did in Libya, is a terrifying possibility.' Then-U.S. Ambassador Terence McCulley, spoke at a mining and oil-production conference on Feb. 8, 2012, the day before Boko Haram threatened to assassinate him in retaliation for U.S. cooperation with efforts to fight terror in Nigeria . The threat against Ambassador McCulley's life in Nigeria had come three months before the Benghazi parades. 'We have had him under surveillance for a while and if the MOU is signed, we will carry out a premeditated attack on him,' Boko Haram had said in a separate statement, according to Nigerian media. 'We know his house in Maitaima [a northern district of Abuja], We know his vehicle and the time he leaves his house and the time he returns.' Nigeria's civilian government, the group added at the time, would be making a grave mistake if it joined America in an 'unholy marriage' to fight 'our men.' The Daily Post Nigeria in Lagos confirmed the report on February 10, 2012, adding that Boko Haram had also threatened 'several suicide attacks on American targets' as part of an 'international jihad.' It's not clear why the State Department resisted adding Boko Haram to its Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) list for so long. A former State Department official who served in a legal capacity under Secretary Clinton told MailOnline on Wednesday that one component of the decision was undeniably political. 'Bulking up the FTO list was not what anyone in leadership wanted,' the former official said. 'At some point it became as much about how things looked as what needed to happen.' The George W. Bush administration added 17 such groups to the FTO list in eight years. Obama's State Department had added 11 by the time he stood for re-election in 2012. During the election season, the Benghazi attack threatened to simultaneously unravel both of Obama's foreign policy victories: the undoing of al-Qaeda through the death of Osama bin Laden, and the promised stabilization of Libya following the overthrow of dictator Muammar Gaddafi, both in 2011. Bringing attention to the expansion of Islamist terror in Nigeria, an important U.S. trading partner, would have counted against Obama as he campaigned to keep his job, according to the former State Department official. 'We all understood, as the State Department does today, that al-Qaeda is far from being defeated,' he said. 'But no one wants to say that in a swing state, right?' The Memorandum Of Understanding between the U.S. and Nigeria was inked six months later, after Clinton visited Abuja personally on August 9, 2012. In it the U.S. offered Nigeria's government assistance 'in forensics and post-attack inspections,' according to a Voice of America report, as well as help improving their methods of tracking and arresting militants – but no direct special-forces or other military assistance. Clinton also proposed to help Nigerian security forces set up an 'intelligence fusion cell' to professionalize the way they shared information, similar to how U.S. military and law enforcement agencies routinely cooperate. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan thanked Clinton in 2012 for America's 'moral support' and 'technical support' during the 2010 elections that brought him to power, but didn’t address any American cooperation with his attempt to crack down on Boko Haram. When Clinton arrived, the group was detonating a bomb nearly every day, racking up a death toll that approached 1,400 – mostly Christians. But the State Department resisted adding . Boko Haram to its list of designated terror groups until John Kerry, . Clinton's successor, pulled the trigger in November 2013 . That same month, McCulley left his post in Nigeria for Ivory Coast. Just another day in Nigeria: Boko Haram destroyed the Gamboru central market on May 5, 2014 in the Ngala district of Borno State in the northeastern region of the country . First lady Michelle Obama launched her bid at 'hashtag diplomacy' after Boko Haram terrorists kidnapped nearly 300 Nigerian girls in April . Clinton fought pressure to regard Boko Haram as a threat to U.S. interests throughout President Barack Obama's first term, as it morphed from a Muslim religious study group in 2002 into a hard-line regional Islamist terror organization by mid-2009. Its militants bombed the United Nations building in Abuja in 2011, bringing new terror-designation pleas from the CIA, the FBI, the Justice Department and more than a dozen members of Congress. The Clinton State Department did add three Boko Haram leaders – as individuals – to its list of terrorists on June 21, 2012. In a press briefing that day, then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters that 'there is always this question of whether designating individuals within an organization is the most effective strategy or whether the designating the whole organization is the most effective strategy. So we’re continuing to look at the question of a broader designation.' 'More broadly,' she added, 'we are working with the government of Nigeria and encouraging it in its dialogue with forces in the north, to promote a unified, multi – pluralistic Nigeria where the rights of all people, no matter their religion, no matter where they live, are protected in its own security efforts, that it examine its tactics, it look more at policing, and that it begin a real dialogue about some of the roots of the dissatisfaction in the north, which are primarily economic.' More than a year later, on July 31, 2013, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was asked for an update after Boko Haram killed 45 people in a series of coordinated attacks. In a May 12, 2014 video released  by Boko Haram, a man claiming to be its leader Abubakar Shekau said hundreds of missing Nigerian schoolgirls had converted to Islam and would not be released until the terror group's militants were freed from Nigerian prisons . 'Can . you comment on why Boko Haram hasn’t been designated as a foreign . terrorist organization?' a reported asked, according to the briefing . transcript. 'I don’t have anything for you on that,' Harf replied. Officially . designating a foreign organization as a terror group allows the U.S. to . freeze bank assets belonging to the group and its members and add them . to no-fly lists. It also permits American law-enforcement agencies to . prioritize their resources toward fighting the organizations. 'Boko Haram' is a loose translation of the Hausa-language phrase 'Western education is sinful.' But that phrase is more of a nickname for the organization whose official moniker is 'Jama'atul Alhul Sunnah Lidda'wati wal Jihad,' or 'people committed to the propagation of the Prophet's teachings and jihad.' The Obama administration has responded to the group's April kidnappings, and to its threat to sell the captured girls into slavery if a prisoner swap isn't agreed to, with what detractors call 'hashtag diplomacy.' First lady Michele Obama appeared in a photograph that quickly circled the globe, holding a placard reading '#BringBackOurGirls.' She followed with a Saturday radio address expressing her outrage over Boko Haram's kidnap spree, but never mentioning its status as a radical Muslim sect, or the Nigeria-wide conflict between northern Muslims and southern Christians that has fed its rise to power. The U.S. Embassy in Abuja has issued repeated warnings about threats to American citizens in Nigeria, including some after the September 2012 Benghazi attack. Intelligence analysts told MailOnline that Boko Haram has been behind a long string of kidnappings since 2010, mostly of Westerners, and largely at the direction of al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). In January 2012 the United Nations Security Council reported that Boko Haram had sent militants to train in AQIM camps in Mali, and Niger's foreign minister said days later that there was credible intelligence the group had trained at AQIM camps across central Africa.","Boko Haram vowed in February 2012 to assassinate Ambassador Terence McCulley if the U.S. helped Nigeria with terror-fighting efforts .

"A strict limit on sugar in pupils’ lunches is to be scrapped in a major overhaul of school meals, it emerged yesterday. The . decision, which provoked an outcry from health and obesity experts, . comes less than a day after World Health Organisation chiefs demanded a . sharp cut in children’s sugar intake. Critics warned ministers against ignoring the WHO advice and wasting a chance to slash sugar intake. Sweets for my sweet: A strict limit on sugar in pupils' lunches is to be scrapped in a major overhaul of school meals - less than a day after the World Health Organisation called for a sharp cut in children's sugar intake . One MP described the school lunch . proposals, which are almost certain to be implemented,  as ‘puzzling to . say the least’. Prescribed levels of fat and salt – as well as vitamins . and minerals such as iron and calcium – are also set to be abandoned . under the Department for Education plans. Separate rules which dictate how many times certain items such as chips can be served during the week will remain in place. Those . rules will be expanded and updated, for example to specify that . wholegrain food must be offered each week to provide fibre to children. But . more than a quarter of primary schools which trialled the proposed new . system exceeded the old sugar limit – of four teaspoons per meal – by . more than 10 per cent. Nutritionists . said ‘robust’ action is needed to meet a new target from the WHO, a . subsidiary of the UN, to reduce adults’ sugar intake to 12 teaspoons per . day and children’s to six. On . Wednesday UN health chiefs went even further, and said adults should . aim to halve this to six teaspoons and children to less than six. Unveiling . its draft advice, WHO officials said sugar may pose the same threat to . health as tobacco. It is increasingly implicated in obesity, heart . disease and a range of other serious illnesses, they warned. A . single fizzy drink serving could exceed the six-teaspoon daily limit. At present, schools in England must comply with two sets of catering . standards: one covering the frequency that specific items must be served . during the week and another prescribing the levels of 14 nutrients in . school lunches. These . nutrient standards stipulate that an average lunch in a primary must . contain no more than 15.5g of sugar – equivalent to just under four . teaspoons. In secondaries the limit is 18.9g, or four-and-a-half . teaspoons. Maximum limits . are also set for fat, saturated fat and sodium, and minimums for key . nutrients such as iron, fibre, zinc, protein and fibre. The . Department for Education, which commissioned chefs Henry Dimbleby and . John Vincent to review school food, said caterers find current rules . ‘over-complicated’. A . consultation paper published yesterday said they were ‘difficult to . understand’ and led to schools paying £20 for each recipe to be . privately analysed. ‘The nutrient-based standards can restrict cooks . from being creative,’ it added. Under . the plans, schools will no longer be required to prove they meet . nutrient standards and will instead use new food-based standards to . devise menus. These state, for example, that desserts, cakes and . biscuits must be served only at lunchtime. But in a trial of this approach, half of secondaries and a third of primaries failed to stay within the maximum sugar limit. There . would be ‘strengthened practical guidance on portion sizes for . desserts’, in addition to existing limits on the quantity of fruit . juices children can drink. Schools remain barred from offering fizzy . drinks. Special treats: A single fizzy drink serving could exceed the six-teaspoon daily limit advised by the WHO . Professor Susan Jebb, an . Oxford University nutritionist who helped draw up the new rules, said: . ‘If a school meets all of those food-based standards, it ought to be . pretty close to meeting the nutrient standards we previously had. Schools can be confident they will be close to them.’ She . said sugar consumption was already higher than the limit in some . schools since cooks found the nutrient rules difficult to implement. Newly-established academy schools will also be required to comply. Tam . Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘These guidelines come just . days after the Chief Medical Officer [Sally Davies] confirmed sugar is . the real disaster. The WHO report was our signpost to crack down on . sugar.’ Katharine Jenner, a . nutritionist at Queen Mary, University of London and Action for Sugar’s . campaign director, said the WHO’s target was ‘such a long way from . where we are’. She added: . ‘Challenging taste preferences in childhood is vital because it affects . the rest of their lives. We would want to look at this in detail and . whether a child’s diet at school will be worse than it was before.’ Labour MP Simon Danczuk said: ‘I believe parents will be extremely  disappointed by this decision. ‘Why . the Government would want to reduce the healthiness of school meals is . puzzling to say the least. The Government is going in the wrong . direction.’","WHO experts says children should have just six teaspoons of sugar a day .
Current rules says school lunches can have no more than four teaspoons .

"Muslim students are to be offered Sharia-compliant interest free loans by the government in an attempt to get more Islamic pupils to go to university. Since tuition fees were increased in September 2012, many Muslim students have been put off continuing their education as it was expected the loans, which are paid back above the rate of inflation, would be used to cover the rising costs - contrary to their beliefs. Following a four-month consultation, a new Sharia-friendly model which involves Muslim students paying a donation into a pool system instead of paying interest has been produced by the Department for Business Innovation & Skills (BIS). Scroll down for video . Encouragement: Muslim students are to be offered Sharia-compliant interest free loans by the government in an attempt to get more Islamic pupils to go to university . The alternative scheme is expected to be introduced within the next three years, but BIS has denied it will pave the way for compliance with Sharia in a wider sense, saying: 'Sharia has no jurisdiction in England and Wales and the Government has no intention to change this position.' It also confirmed that students taking out the loans will pay . back exactly the same amount as those who use the traditional scheme, . essentially making a charitable donation rather than paying back . interest. With universities now charging tuition fees of up to £9,000, most students borrow money from the Student Loan Company (SLC) - taking out loans of up to £9,000 to cover their tuition fees and up to £4,375 for their maintenance costs. While they are studying, the loan carries an interest rate of the Retail Price Index, currently 2.5per cent, plus 3 per cent, and when paying back the loan the interest rate, based on their income, will be between RPI and RPI plus 3 per cent. Once a student is earning a £21,000-a-year salary, repayments are made at a rate of 9per cent of any yearly income over that amount. Working: Instead of paying back interest on their loans, students will make a Takaful contribution - which is perceived as a charitable contribution from a Sharia perspective . The need to take out a loan to cover the cost of university led to concerns being raised by many Muslims that paying it back was incompatible with their beliefs, and the rising fees meant families were unable to fund courses themselves. Around 20,000 people responded to the consultation document,with 93per cent saying students with religious objections to the charging of interest had been affected by the changes in tuition fees and student loans. Sharia is a moral and religious code . which affects everything from a believer’s personal hygiene to diet and finance. In terms of the latter, it prohibits acceptance of specific . interest (known as riba) or fees for loans of money, whether . the payment is fixed or floating. To comply with Sharia, any loan must be Qard (free of profit)'. This therefore excludes student loans, which accrue interest (albeit, at a very low rate, equivalent to the rate of inflation). There is not a strictly codified uniform set of laws that can be called Sharia. It is considered a system of several laws, based on the Qur'an, Hadith and centuries of debate, interpretation and precedent. Attempts to implement Sharia law have been met with opposition . globally. There is no consensus between Islamic schools of thought on . how far-reaching Sharia law should be. Of 1,054 Muslim students who gave an example of their experiences when completing the survey, 337 said they objected to the interest, and 144 stated they would not go to university as a direct result of requiring an interest bearing loan. One said: 'Students, including myself, chose to stay at home through their higher education in order to take only the minimal loan necessary to avoid extra interest. 'Most significantly in my opinion, this seriously limits the options of universities that they can apply to as they can only apply to ones within a reasonable commutable distance. 'This might mean that they miss out on courses only available at specific universities, or miss out on applying for the best universities for their course of interest. 'This can hinder these students from the best career for themselves that they could possibly have achieved otherwise.' The new loans will operate under the Sharia model of ‘Takaful’, a form of Islamic insurance where people contribute money into a pool system to guarantee other members against loss or damage. The fund will be established with an initial sum of money, either donated to the fund or provided as an interest-free loan, and applying for money is expected to be done in a similar way to existing loans. Students will make a Takaful contribution - which is perceived as a charitable donation from a Sharia perspective. BIS insist . that the scheme will not leave non-Muslim students out-of-pocket, as the . loan repayments will simply be reinvested into the ‘pool’ for future . students’ funds. The government worked with Islamic financial experts to come up with the product, working under the criteria that the repayments and debt levels must be identical to a traditional loan, ensuring that students who took up the alternative scheme would end up no better or worse off than others. It was also ruled that repayments should be made directly through the UK tax system, making it as simple to do as for those paying back traditional student loans. A spokesman said: 'Making higher education more accessible to all is part of government’s long-term economic plan to boost skills and strengthen growth. 'The overwhelming response to our consultation has shown the strong demand for a Sharia-compliant alternative finance model for student loans that everyone can access. We support this idea and will now work towards its development.' The National Association of Student Money Advisers agreed that there is no hard and fast answer to the problem, saying that 'there is a variety of interpretations amongst Muslim groups as to what would be acceptable under Sharia requirements.' Sharia is a moral and religious code which affects everything from a believer’s personal hygiene to finance and diet. Attempts to implement Sharia law have been met with opposition globally. There is no consensus between Islamic schools of thought on how far-reaching Sharia should be.","Many Muslim students have been put off university by high tuition fees .

"In a stunning admission Tuesday afternoon, a senior White House official told reporters on a conference call that part of the continuing U.S. mission in Afghanistan will involve training security forces in that country to 'help us' defeat al-Qaeda – not the other way around. The White House has sought to assure the press that the U.S. role after 2014 would be reduced to what President Barack Obama called 'an advisory role' just an hour later. But the official's statement, which drew no follow-up inquiry from the few reporters permitted to ask questions, indicates that American forces will take on a more substantial part of Afghanistan's coming security needs. Obama said at the White House that 'one year ago Afghan security forces assumed the lead in combat operations,' and that 2014 will be 'the year we will conclude our combat mission in Afghanistan.' But his senior surrogate told a different story. 'We want to maintain a counterterrorism ability' there to keep al-Qaeda in check, he said. 'We're going to train Afghan National Security Forces to help us in mitigating that threat.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Who's helping whom? President Barack Obama said the US was training Afghan fighters to be independent and autonomous, but a senior White House official said an hour earlier that the Afghans were being trained 'to help us' fight terrorists . 'We have struck significant blows against al-Qaeda's leadership,' Obama said, claiming credit for killing Osama bin Laden . Obama does a Hawaiian ;shaka' as he greets US troops during a surprise visit to Bagram Air Field . Both the president and the senior official emphasized the United States' incremental victories over Islamist terror groups, although neither mentioned Islam. 'We have struck significant blows against al-Qaeda's leadership,' Obama said. 'We have eliminated Osama bin Laden. We have prevented Afghanistan from being used to launch attacks against our homeland.' 'We've helped train and equip [Afghan] security forces,' he added. 'Now we're finishing the job we started.' Still, Obama plans to . leave 9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan at the end of the year, . officially to continue training Afghan fighters for their longer-term . battles with al-Qaeda and to stymie insurgent attacks. And the senior official said that by the end of 2016, one month before Obama leaves office, America's presence in Afghanistan will be reduced to an 'embassy presence with a security assistance office.' That opens up the possibility that Bagram Air Base, the sprawling 8-square-mile center of U.S. combat operations there, could be shuttered or turned over to Afghanistan. It could also be maintained with a skeleton crew in case the U.S. needed to return in force, according to a Pentagon analyst who spoke with MailOnline on background. However they are deployed, servicemen and women are likely to remain in harm's way. There are currently about 32,800 Americans serving in Afghanistan, down from a high of about 100,000 in the middle of 2010. Obama promised during his February 2013 State of the Union address to Congress that the U.S. effort there would draw to a close by the end of 2014. Vague message: 'This year we will bring the war in Afghanistan to a responsible end,' Obama said -- but he's leaving 9,800 servicemen and women behind . President Barack Obama made his sixth visit to Afghanistan over the weekend, but just his first since winning re-election in 2012 . He . said Sunday that he has 'made it clear that we’re prepared to continue . cooperating with our Afghan partners on two security missions: training . and equipping Afghan forces and targeting – counterterrorism targets – . against al Qaeda.' House Armed Services Chairman Buck McKeon, a California Republican, blasted the president's move on Tuesday. 'Holding this mission to an arbitrary egg-timer doesn’t make a lick of sense strategically,' McKeon said in a statement. Telegraphing military deployment and withdrawal timetables to America's enemies has become a bone of contention for Obama, even among otherwise friendly national security experts. 'Good for Obama for keeping 9,800 troops in Afghanistan as requested by Gen. Dunford,' tweeted Council on Foreign Relations scholar Max Boot. 'Too bad he is imposing a counterproductive timeline.' And Justin Logan, the director of foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, tweeted a mocking note: 'If you like your 2014 Afghanistan withdrawal date, you can keep it.' 'Holding this mission to an arbitrary egg-timer doesn¿t make a lick of sense strategically': Rep. Buck McKeon, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, slammed Obama's move . A prickly Obama scolded a reporter . from the Real Clear Politics website on Tuesday during an educational . event at the White House after she asked him a question about . Afghanistan. 'I’m sorry, we’re doing a science fair – c’mon. C’mon,' Obama said before walking out of the room. Other congressional Republicans issued their thoughts on Obama's announcements late Tuesday afternoon. Senate Armed Services Committee ranking Republican Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma said in a statement that in hearings and meetings with military leaders 'it has been determined that we need 13,000 troops on the ground to best accomplish the mission with Afghans [sic] security forces.' 'Anything less, and we are putting more lives at risk,' he said. And House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said he doubt the policy 'reflected by these numbers and timelines' that the president outlined. 'Even now, an al-Qaeda safe haven is emerging in northeastern Afghanistan; and I question whether the enemy will take further advantage of the announced timeline to renew its efforts to launch new operations, as we see them attempting in Iraq and Syria today.' U.S. military personnel will only remain in the country if its president . signs a Bilateral Security Agreement – something Hamid Karzai has . resisted but his likely successors say they will embrace. That document . is intended to formalize U.S. efforts to train Afghans and launch counterterrorism operations. 'Already, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women,' Obama said in this State of the Union speech 15 months ago. 'This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead.' 'Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. This drawdown will continue and by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over.' Loophole: Obama has insisted he will not keep any Americans in Afghanistan without a signed security agreement that would grant those forces immunity from Afghan law . 'For many of you, this will be your last tour in Afghanistan,' Obama said to applause -- but nearly 10,000 will end up staying . But the . president still alluded to that security agreement that Karzai refused . to sign, saying the U.S. aimed to remain in-country to actively hunt . down al-Qaeda and help Afghans do the same. 'Beyond . 2014, America’s commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will . endure,' Obama said, 'but the nature of our commitment will change.' 'We're . negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two . missions – training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country . does not again slip into chaos, and counterterrorism efforts that allow . us to pursue the remnants of al-Qaeda and their affiliates. Instead of a total withdrawal, . the senior White House official confirmed, U.S. troop numbers would drop . by half by the end of next year and dwindle near zero by the time Obama . leaves office. Obama doubled down on his promise four months ago in his 2014 State of the Union address, this time promising that only a 'small force' would remain behind after 2014. 'More than . 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan,' he told . Congress on January 28. 'With Afghan forces now in the lead for their . own security, our troops have moved to a support role.' 'Together . with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this . year, and America’s longest war will finally be over.' 'If . the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have . negotiated,' he added, 'a small force of Americans could remain in . Afghanistan with NATO allies.' The 9,800 American troops who remain after December will be mainly stationed in Kabul and at Bagram Air Base. Obama visited Bagram on Sunday, surprising servicemen and women with a pledge . to bring America’s longest war to a 'responsible end' by the . close of the year. He said then that the . war had reached a pivotal point since with Afghan forces were prepared to take primary . responsibility for their country’s security. Whither Bagram? Obama spoke Sunday at Bagram Air Base, but its future is uncertain as the White House plans to have nothing more by the end of Obama's presidency than an embassy with a security office nearby . Obama was greeted by US Ambassador to Afghanistan James Cunningham (C) and Marine General Joseph Dunford, commander of the US-led International Security Assistance Force (L) -- the men who will preside over a continued US presence there . 'For many of . you, this will be your last tour in Afghanistan,' Obama told hundreds . of U.S. troops inside an airplane hangar on Sunday 'America’s war in Afghanistan will come to a responsible end.' But 'America's commitment to . the people of Afghanistan will endure,' he added. 'After all the . sacrifices we've made, we want to preserve the gains you have helped to . win.' The president was expected to make an . announcement about Afghanistan on Wednesday during a speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Instead, the White House elected to make a Rose Garden announcement Tuesday afternoon. Elections are underway to replace Karzai, the only president . Afghanistan has known since the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. He and Obama have spoken just once in the past year. At least 2,181 U.S. military personnel have died during the nearly 13-year Afghan war. Obama has staked much of his foreign policy philosophy on ending the two wars he inherited from his predecessor, George W. Bush. The final American troops withdrew . from Iraq in the closing days of 2011 after the U.S. and Iraq failed to . reach a security agreement to keep a small American residual force in . the country. In the years that have followed the American withdrawal, . Iraq has been battered by resurgent waves of violence. U.S. officials say they're trying to avoid a similar scenario. Afghanistan 'will not be a perfect place. And it is not America's responsibility to make it one,' Obama said Tuesday in the White House Rose Garden. 'Americans have learned that it's harder to end wars than it is to begin them – but this is how wars end in the 21st century.'","A senior White House official told reporters Tuesday that 'we want to maintain a counterterrorism ability ... we're going to train Afghan National Security Forces to help us in mitigating that threat'
But Obama said Tuesday afternoon that in 2015 'Afghans will be fully responsible for securing their country' and the US will be limited to 'an advisory role'
'This year we will bring the war in Afghanistan to a responsible end,' he said .
The conference-call official said by the end of 2016 the US would have only an 'embassy presence with a security assistance office' – meaning Bagram Air Base could be closed or given to the Afghans .
Obama said in January's that only 'a small force' of Americans might stay behind, but nearly 10,000 U.S. military personnel will remain .
Originally the White House said they would help a few thousand NATO troops train Afghan fighters, and man 'counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al-Qaeda'

"An unprecedented lung virus that has infected over 1000 children across 10 states from the Midwest to the east coast is likely to spread to the rest of the country, doctors have warned. Hospitals have reported unusually high numbers of children being admitted - some into intensive care - with the same viral symptoms, which usually start as a common cold before developing into severe respiratory distress. Experts have not yet been able to officially identity the virus, however some cases have tested positive to Enterovirus D68 or EV-D68, a rare respiratory virus that typically causes asthma-like symptoms. Suspected outbreaks have already been recorded in Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Iowa, Colorado, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Carolina, and Georgia, Mark Pallansch, the director of the Division of Viral Diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Widespread: The virus has already been reported across 10 states - Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Iowa, Colorado, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Carolina, and Georgia - and is likely to spread, doctors say . Unprecedented: Some of the children taken to hospital have been admitted to intensive care with problems breathing . 'It is only 10 states now, but it's going to be across the country,' ABC News Chief Health and Medical Editor Dr. Richard Besser told the station. 'So if your state doesn't have it now, watch for it, it's coming.' Mark Pallansch, a virologist and director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Viral Diseases, told CNN that the cases already being treated are 'just the tip of the iceberg in terms of severe cases'. While enteroviruses are quite common, the EV-D68 is rare, but there is no data showing any deaths have been elated to an EV-D68 infection in the United States. The first cases were reported in the Midwest in August. In Kansas City, Missouri, about 450 children were treated at one facility - Children's Mercy Hospital - with at least 60 of them admitted to intensive care. Children's Mercy Hospital's division director for Infectious Diseases, Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, said the problem was 'big' and 'unprecedented'. Close call: The parents of Will Cornejo, 13, feared their son would not make it after he struggled to breath this week and was rushed to Rocky Mountain Hospital in Denver. He is one of hundreds of children being admitted to hospital for respiratory distress . Feared the worst: Jennifer Corneyjo said she didn't know to what to expect after her son Will went white and his lips turned blue as he struggled to breath . 'I've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics, and I've never seen anything quite like this,' Dr. Jackson told CNN. 'We've had to mobilize other providers, doctors, nurses. It's big. I would call it unprecedented. 'It's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care.' Dr. Jackson said the problem started around when school went back on August 17 and peaked between August 21 and 30. The CDC says that some 19 of the cases in Kansas City tested positive for Enterovirus D68. There is no specific treatment for an EV-D68 infection. Ventilation appears to be the best away to assist patients with the infection. There is also no available vaccine. 'It's the worst I've seen in my time': Dr. Raju Meyeppan from Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children in Denver said he is worried about what will happen in winter . Intense: Will required a breathing for 24 hours to help get enough oxygen into his lungs . 'The full scope is yet to be known, but it would appear it's in the Midwest,' Dr. Jackson said. 'In our community (in Kansas City), meticulous hand-washing is not happening. 'It's just the nature of kids. Worst I've seen.' Symptoms include fever, body and muscles aches, sneezing, coughing and rash, CNN reported. Rocky Mountain Hospital in Denver reported five children in their intensive care unit and 20 more in the pediatric unit. Will Cornejo, 13, was among the children in intensive care after he came down with a cold last weekend. His mother, Jennifer Corneyjo, said when her son took a turn for the worse on Tuesday, struggling to breath, she feared the worst. 'It was like nothing we've ever seen,' Jennifer Cornejo told CNN affiliate KUSA. 'He was unresponsive. He couldn't speak to me. He was turning white and his lips turned blue.' Will needed a breathing aparatus for 24 hours. Nationwide Children's Hopsital in East Columbus, Ohio, reported a 20 percent increase in patients with respiratory illness last weekend. They are testing to see whether the cases are EV-D68. Hannibal Regional Hospital in Hannibal, Missouri, said on Facebook they were dealth with 'recent outbreaks of enterovirus infections in Missouri and Illinois'.

"Most obese people are in denial over their weight, not accepting they are clinically 'obese', a new study by Cancer Research has found . Most obese people are in denial about their weight, refusing to believe they are 'obese' or even 'very overweight', new research has found. In one of the first studies of its kind to examine perceptions of obesity, fewer than 10 per cent of those who are clinically obese accept they have a serious weight problem. A survey carried out in 2012 examined 2,000 adults and found only 11 per cent of obese women accurately acknowledged they were 'obese'. Most of the women questioned believed they were either 'very overweight' or 'just right', Cancer Research said. Among men taking part, only seven per cent correctly judged their own weight, accepting they were 'obese'. Sixteen per cent of obese male responders classified themselves as 'very overweight'. Researchers discovered only 10 per cent of those taking part knew the Body Mass Index threshold for obesity. However those who knew a BMI of between 30 and 39.9 made a person obese were more likely to define themselves as such. Experts fear as bigger sizes become the new 'normal', people are less likely to recognise the health problems linked to their weight. Professor Jane Wardle, co-author of the study and director of the Cancer Research UK centre at UCL, said: 'It's a real worry that people don't recognise that their weight places them in the obese category. 'It means they aren't aware they are at increased risk of a number of health problems including cancer. 'This is despite increased media coverage of obesity, and public health campaigns aimed at improving public awareness.' She added that the term 'obese' is often considered derogatory, which may be why so many people reject it. 'Mass media often illustrate obesity in a way that people find offensive, with pictures of bulging beer bellies and huge behinds, so people shy away from these images. 'But we also asked people whether they felt they were ""very overweight"" and the majority of those who were obese did not accept this term either. 'This is a real problem, as it means they are unlikely to identify with health messages on the subject of weight. She added: 'We need to establish better ways for health professionals to address this sensitive subject and communicate with people whose health would benefit from positive lifestyle changes.' Around 18,000 cases of cancer in the UK each year are linked to being overweight or obese. Excess weight is known to increase the risk of several types of cancer including cancers of the breast in post-menopausal women, bowel, womb, oesophagus, pancreas, kidney and gallbladder. Excess weight is known to increase the risk of several types of cancer including cancers of the breast, pictured under the microscope, bowel, womb, oesophagus, pancreas, kidney and gallbladder . Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK's head of health information, said: 'This study provides an interesting insight into how people who are overweight view themselves. 'Carrying those extra pounds can have serious health implications. 'Fat cells are active, releasing hormones and other chemicals that affect many parts of the body, and increase the risk of cancer. 'Maintaining a healthy body weight is one of the most important ways of reducing the risk of cancer, for both men and women. 'It's so important that health messaging and awareness campaigns are as effective as possible in supporting people of all shapes and sizes to make healthy choices.' In a separate study scientists in Liverpool discovered the majority of people, including doctors, are unable to visually identify whether a person is a healthy weight, overweight or obese. Psychologists at the University of Liverpool asked participants to look at photographs of male models and categorise whether they are a healthy weight, overweight or obese according to World Health Organisation BMI guidelines. They found the majority of people surveyed were unable to correctly identify the models' weight. Instead they underestimated weight, often believing overweight men to be healthy. In a related study, surveying healthcare professionals, researchers also found GPs and trainee GPs were unable to visually identify if a person was overweight or obese. A separate study at the University of Liverpool found GPs and trainee GPs were unable to visually identify if a person was overweight or obese . The scientists also examined whether increased exposure to overweight and obese people affected a person's ability to estimate the weight of a person. Their findings suggested that exposure to heavier body weights may influence what people see as a normal and healthy weight and causes people to underestimate a person's weight. Psychologist, Dr Eric Robinson, who conducted the research, said: 'We wanted to find out if people can identify a healthy, overweight or obese person just by looking at them. 'Primarily we found that people were often very inaccurate and this included trainee doctors and qualified doctors too. Moreover, we found that participants systematically underestimated when a person was overweight or obese. 'Our study of GPs also found a tendency to underestimate weight which has important implications as it means that overweight and obese patients could end up not being offered weight management support or advice.' Recent studies have found that parents underestimate their overweight or obese child's weight and this could also act as a barrier to intervention. Dr Robinson added: 'Over the last 30 years we have seen changes to population body weight, so examining how this has affected how we view our own and other people's body sizes is an interesting area of research.' The UK has the highest level of obesity in Western Europe. Obesity levels in the UK have more than trebled in the last 30 years and, on current estimates, more than half the population could be obese by 2050. More than half of the adult population in the EU are overweight or obese.","Cancer Research survey found fewer than 10% of people who are clinically obese accept they have a serious weight problem .

"Primary school children as young as four were banned from saying goodbye to their parents in the playground for 'health and safety reasons'. Parents say pupils  at Forster Park Primary School in Catford, south London, have been left 'inconsolable' by the 'big change'. The school sent out letters to parents this week saying they were 'banned' from the entering the playground, from where they were previously allowed to wave off their children. Scroll down for video . Parents have been stopped from saying goodbye to their children in the school playground at Forster Park Primary School in Catford, south London, pictured above, for health and safety reasons . The letter says parents should say goodbye at the school gate, adding: 'From tomorrow morning (Thursday), we are asking for parents not to enter the playground and to say goodbye to their children at the school gate. 'This is for health and safety reasons. We know that this is a big change but we know that you will work with us to ensure that the start of the school day is even better than it is already. 'Arrangements for collecting your children at the end of the day will remain unchanged, meaning that parents come onto the school playground as you do already.' A spokesman for Lewisham Council said the new rule was to minimise disruption caused by 'extensive building work' which is currently going on at the 500-pupil school. But the school said this afternoon that it was now working to provide parents with an alternative place to drop their children off, starting from next week. One mother, who asked not to be named, said her five-year-old daughter was left 'inconsolable' as she was led off into the school without a 'proper goodbye'. She said: 'My daughter was quite anxious about going to school and suffers from separation anxiety, so it is important for me to be able to say goodbye to her properly. 'Instead, we were told not to stray past the school gates, so I ended up watching her being led away in tears while I stood watching, in tears myself.' Michala Cohen told News Shopper that her five-year-old daughter Tymisha was 'really upset' while other children were 'hysterical' about not being able to give their parents a kiss and cuddle. The 23-year-old said: 'My daughter would not leave my side and was really upset. Lots of the other kids were hysterical as well. 'Normally she's a really happy girl and actually skips into school but she wasn't comfortable with this whatsoever. 'The kids are used to their mums taking them in and kissing them goodbye so today was heartbreaking not being able to do that.' School head Mark Gale had said the 'priority' was to ensure the health and safety of the pupils and said the new routine was a 'smoother way' to start the day in the new term. He said all decisions were made in the best interests of pupils and that he would be monitoring the new arrangements. He later added: 'The school has had some major building works over the summer and a number of classrooms have been repositioned. 'It was clear on the first morning back that the old arrangements for dropping off children were no longer suitable and were creating a confused and an unsafe situation. 'I am working with parents to find a better, smoother way to drop children off. We have further works at the school over the weekend and we will be amending our arrangements, taking into account feedback from parents, which will allow parents to use a part of the playground to drop off their children. 'It was never our intention to cause any distress to children and parents of Forster Park.' The letter was sent by Mr Gale on the first day of his job. He wrote: 'I would also like to say how impressed I am with the children of Forster Park; they all look so smart ad ready for learning. 'I am so proud of them, and it's only my first day here. Thank you for sending in such smart children.' He also raises another health and safety issue in the letter, telling parents that birthday cake will not be given out on the pupils' birthdays. He said: 'Due to allergies I am afraid that we cannot give out birthday cake, party bags or anything else on birthdays. 'However, we will do everything we can to make sure that your child's birthday is acknowledged and that they have an especially enjoyable day. 'I appreciate that these are quite big changes, but as ever, we are putting the children and their safety first.'","Rule introduced by Forster Park Primary School in Catford, south London .

"Biblical names are out and pop culture is in for America's newborns - if this year's list of most popular baby names are anything to go by. The once hearty trend of parents naming their babies after Biblical scripture has shown a steady decline in recent years according to an annual baby name report by BabyCenter.com. What can be gathered in supplement shows a perhaps surprising uptick in inspiration from pop culture such as erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, TV show Downton Abbey and even Apple electronics. Inspired: Beyonce's newborn baby Blue Ivy, pictured with her here, may be behind the slight jump in the same names for babies born this year along with other pop culture references . Among names taken from the Bible for 2012 there were just three boys' names among the list of top 10 - Ethan, Noah and Jacob - while none made the top 10 list for girls. TOP 10 BOYS NAMES: . TOP 10 GIRLS NAMES: . That's a stark contrast from 12 years ago when Biblical names dominated the top 10 list, in 2000 it being: Michael, Jacob, Matthew, Joseph, Joshua, and Andrew. For girls in 2000 it was Hannah, Sarah and Elizabeth. If any trend can be seen this year one could blame at least one other book Americans are reading right now. From EL James’ Fifty Shades of Grey, first name Grey shot up 155 spots. Anastasia rose 43 spots and Elliot - Christian Grey's brother - went up by 14 per cent. If any Downtown Abbey fans received visits from the Stork this year, they may be mutually held responsible for an increase in the names Branson (by 32 per cent), Charlie (23 per cent), Elsie (29 per cent), and Daisy (27 per cent). Names Edith, Sybil, Robert, Cora, Isobel and Violet also rose. TV admirers: Names featured in the hit TV show Downtown Abbey also showed a spike with the name Branson, like the character named Tom Branson pictured, seeing a rise by 32 per cent . Perhaps further showing the times - contrasting back when actress Gwyneth Paltrow and Coldplay musician Chris Martin named their baby 'Apple' surprising many who had never heard of the fruit and widespread computer manufacturer used as a name - Apple rose 15 per cent this year. Adding to the Apple iPhone, iPad, iMac buzz, the name Siri – Apple’s computer generated assistant - climbed by 5 per cent while Mac for boys jumped by 12 per cent. All three names are still deep down on the list, however, with Apple taking 3,204th place, Siri taking 1,427th, and Mac taking 624. Surprise ending: The names Grey, Anastasia and Elliot, featured in the erotic book Fifty Shades of Grey by E L James, pictured, also saw a rise among newborns . Musicians Beyoncé and Jay-Z's uniquely named Blue Ivy Carter also perhaps stirred a rise in names Blue and Ivy which both saw an increase this year - Blue by 51 per cent and Ivy by 27 per cent. Though Blue is still down on the list hitting 2,571th place, Ivy rose to 157th place. Among this year's most popular names, Aiden tops list of top 10 for the eight year in a row while Sophia continues to hold her own among the girls' 10 for the fifth year running.",Other names gaining popularity are found mirroring those in erotic book Fifty Shades of Grey and TV show Downton Abbey .
"Extremist: Cleric Anwar al-Awlaki (pictured) was allegedly promoted in assemblies at one Birmingham school, Park View Academy . A Muslim headmistress told last night how she was driven out of her job by extremists bent on taking over state schools. Her school is one of 12 apparently targeted by Islamic fundamentalists in a plot dating back two decades. In a letter seen by the Mail, a fanatic brags about enlisting four radical parents to help oust her in 1993. She said: ‘I was the victim of a pernicious, well-orchestrated smear campaign I have never been able to recover from. ‘People need to know this is a dangerous, well-organised and sinister group who have the capacity to destroy. They are producing fear in society and playing on paranoia. They are extremely powerful.’ The 69-year-old believes she was seen as an enemy because she was too moderate a Muslim. She was confronted with a number of allegations, including one of financial mismanagement. Despite protesting her innocence her dismissal followed in 1994. She added: ‘I was involved in a campaign so nasty that, since I lost the headship, I’ve never been able to raise my head above the parapet. ‘I was shocked to read this letter after 20 years and I am genuinely scared by it.’ Details of the extraordinary plot, which have been referred to the police, emerged on Friday after the letter was passed to Birmingham Council and a number of newspapers. The unnamed author admits making false claims against several teachers in Birmingham in order to oust them. The document discusses extending the ‘jihad’ operation to Bradford and Manchester – cities with fast growing Muslim populations. Balwant Bains, former headmaster of Saltley School, said: 'I had to leave. I am trying to move away from a very horrible, horrible experience, and I am pleased that it has been exposed' Investigation: There have been allegations of faked resignation letters at Adderley Primary School in Birmingham, possibly connected to a reported Trojan Horse operation by Islamic fundamentalists . The letter identifies specific schools . as targets and names heads it claims to have ousted through dirty . tricks campaigns, forged resignation letters and false allegations of . cheating and financial irregularities. It . claims the former head of Birmingham’s Regents Park Primary, Tina . Ireland, was forced to resign after the group ‘planted the seed’ that . she was encouraging pupils to cheat in exams. Another . head, who is understood to have resigned following a plot to oust him, . said he had been vindicated by exposure of the wider campaign, which the . extremists called ‘Trojan Horse’. Balwant . Bains, former headmaster of Saltley School, said: ‘I had to leave. I am . trying to move away from a very horrible, horrible experience, and I am . pleased that it has been exposed.’ Another school – also named in the letter as a target – is alleged to have allowed extremist preachers into school assemblies. Plot: It was claimed that fundamentalists 'planted the seed' that the head of Regents Park Primary, pictured, had encouraged pupils to cheat in exams . Governors . at Park View Academy, whose pupils are almost all Muslim, apparently . organised an ‘extended Islamic assembly’ for its Year 10 and 11 children . with Sheikh Shady Al Suleiman, who has called on Allah to ‘destroy the . enemies of Islam’ and to ‘prepare us for the jihad’. The . academy was rated outstanding by Ofsted in 2012 and has been praised by . the Prime Minister. But according to former staff, the Trojan Horse . operation is taking hold. One said a senior teacher at the academy repeatedly endorsed the terrorist ideologue Anwar Al Awlaki at school assemblies. Awlaki, who was killed by a US drone strike in 2011, was a leading Al Qaeda recruiter. A former supply teacher at the school told the Mail she was forced to wear the head scarf at work against her will. Park . View Academy, which is headed by Lindsey Clark, was given a snap Ofsted . inspection this week after claims were raised of unfair treatment of . non-Muslim staff. The . chairman of governors, Tahir Alam, is referred to several times in the . letter as being involved in the plot. But the senior activist in the . Muslim Council of Britain and vice-chair of the Association of Muslim . Schools said the letter was a ‘malicious fabrication’. Birmingham City Council has launched an investigation which is being monitored by police and the Department for Education. The Mail understands Education Secretary Michael Gove met the leader of the council last month to discuss the documents. The . letter says: ‘We have caused a great amount of organised disruption in . Birmingham and as a result we now have our own academies and are on our . way to getting rid of more headteachers and taking over their schools. ‘Whilst sometimes the practices we use may not seem the correct way to do things you must remember this is a jihad.’ Assemblies were allegedly carried out in Park View School promoting radical Muslim clerics with links to terrorism and extremist views .

"The Cyprus bailout crisis could lead to yet another country’s banks being put in peril. The cost of borrowing in Slovenia tripled last week amid market fears for the future of eurozone countries. Government bond rates soared from 1.2per cent to 4.26per cent, putting the future of the country’s nationally owned banks at risk. People waited in line outside the Laiki Bank branch in Nicosia, Cyprus, today as economists feared Slovenia would be the next country in need of a bailout . ‘Slovenia is now inevitably heading to a bailout, the eurozone shot itself completely in the foot following the Cyprus issue,’ said Tim Ash, head of European research at Standard Bank. The International Monetary Fund said the country’s banks ‘are under severe distress’ due to the size of bad loans sitting on their books. ‘The country has lost competitiveness since joining the euro in 2007 and it’s leading to slow economic collapse,’ said analyst Lars Christensen from Danske Bank. ‘The banks need recapitalisation, and it is not easy to raise money in this climate.’ Slovenia, with a population of just two million, is expected to see output slump by two per cent this year. The next test of international confidence in the country will come early this summer. The state will need to raise more money in early June, when £766million of government debt comes up for renewal. It will have to find a total of £2.5billion to keep on running. Its banks, many of which are which are state-owned, are unable to take on large amounts of government debt, meaning the money will have to come from outside sources. Analysts are sceptical it will be able to raise the cash in the wake of the £8.5billion Cyprus bailout. This will provoke fears EU authorities will launch a tax raid on Slovenian bank accounts, just as they did in Cyprus. Cyprus was yesterday still reeling from its bailout plans. British expat pensioners are struggling to pay for food and bills as banks refuse to release their UK pension payments. Former NHS nurse Diane Ameur-Zaimeche, 71, said of her £400-a-month pension: ‘I’ve been told all money being sent to Cyprus is being sat on by the government’s Central Bank.’ Banks in Cyprus opened for normal business for a second day but with strict restrictions on how much money people could withdraw while the International Monetary Fund said Slovenia's banks 'are under severe distress' President Nicos Anastasiades said yesterday risk of bankruptcy had been contained and Cyprus had no intention of leaving the euro. Slovenia’s recently elected prime minister Alenka Bratusek insisted her country should not be compared to Cyprus. ‘Our banking system is stable and safe,’ she said. But the IMF said: ‘The new government should promptly address bank restructuring, corporate sector debt overhang and governance and involvement of the state in the economy.’ Economists polled by Reuters said Slovenia and Spain were now the two eurozone nations most likely to need a bailout. Analysts are increasingly sceptical Slovenia will be able to raise £2.5billion to keep running in the wake of Cyprus's £8.5billion bailout .","Government bond rates in Slovenia soared from 1.2per cent to 4.26per cent .

"Britons are 'pre-toxing' in the run-up to Christmas so that they can indulge more come December, with people hoping to lose an average of half a stone in the festive run-up. A new study also shows Brits rate looking good at the office Christmas party more important than a first date or a new job. However, post Christmas, we don't show the commitment needed to follow through with their regime. People in UK are hoping to lose an average of half a stone in festive run-up, with 47 per cent are starting their healthy 'pre-tox' fitness regime in next week in preparation for extra-eating over Christmas . In a poll conducted on 2,000 UK adults, half questioned revealed that they are 'pre-toxing', but only a third admitted they expect to see their diet and fitness regime through to the New Year. 47 per cent of us are starting our healthy 'pre-tox' fitness regime in the next week, with almost a quarter revealing the motivation was looking good at their office Christmas party. Instead of just relying on some old-fashioned jogging and calorie-counting, thousands have turned to new technology in an effort to beat the bulge. Nearly a fifth of those questioned admitted to using wearable technology or juicing machines to stay on track. Almost a quarter said motivation is looking good at their Christmas party . Data from Currys PC World supports the pre-tox trend and shows a 20% increase in sales of its juicers and 27% increase in its wearable products per week. The survey showed that women take pre-Christmas slimming down more seriously, with men only thinking about shaping up for Christmas towards the end of November, two weeks after women begin their weight loss effort. 80 per cent of people believe that they put on weight during the Christmas period, with some putting on as much as 8lb from over-eating. 80 per cent of people believe that they put on weight during the Christmas period, with some putting on as much as 8lb from over-eating . Celebrity fitness and nutrition expert, Lucy Wyndham-Read, said: 'It's always hard to think healthy at Christmas. 'As the work life balance gets harder for many of us, some of the latest health and fitness gadgets can give us a helping hand. 'My clients regularly turn to their Philips Avances or Tom Tom Runners to make exercise and healthy living a little more exciting.' 1. Walking a little faster is a great way to burn off some extra calories. Aim to walk at a speed of 4 miles per hour, as this helps you burn fat. 2. In the office, set a timer on a watch or your phone and every 20 minutes, simply stand up and move if even for a few seconds. After 20 minutes of sitting the body starts to slow down the amount of calories you burn, so just move every 20 minutes to keep it fully active. 3. Ditch the biscuit tin and swap for a smoothie and save calories and get your vitamins at the same time. 4. Every day, challenge yourself to burn off an extra 100 calories over the build up to Christmas, this way you can have banked and be in credit by at least 2,400 calories. 5. Skipping for 10 minutes can burn up to 135 calories and at the same time sculpts and tones your lower body. 6. Keep your body fuller for longer by adding in some oats to your smoothies, throwing these into your blender will help stabilise your blood sugar levels so you will be less tempted to snack on the mince pies in the office. 7. Taking the stairs take two at a time, this works your thighs and butt harder and avoid using the hand rail as then you contract your abs more for balance. 8. Music is a great motivator, so create a new playlist and name it 'My Pre-tox Christmas Playlist' then listen to this when you work out. 9. Keep your workout gear on the radiator as this way you are more likely to slip into it and head out in the winter for a quick workout. 10. Apply the two D's which are simply 'determination' and 'discipline' and you will get you the desired results. Just make sure you stay on track with your pre-tox of smoothies and exercise. Ben Lovett, Currys PC World spokesperson, added: 'Brits are becoming more health conscious than ever and the beauty of juicers and wearable products is that they are easy to use on a daily basis. 'The 'Jawbone Up' for example provides new and immediate insights into how you sleep, move and eat, which will help you make smarter choices. 'Then the NutriBullet comes with a single-serve cup so you can drink your juice on the go.'","People in UK are hoping to lose an average of half a stone in festive run-up .

"A school which gave out iPads to every pupil in hope of improving their education has admitted that just a year later half the costly devices have been broken. Honywood Community Science School dished out iPad2 tablets to its 1,200 pupils a year ago, at vast cost to the taxpayer. Despite warnings that children would not be able to look after the fragile computer tablet, the school in Coggeshall, Essex, allowed children to take the device outside the classroom, playground and street and home at evenings and weekends. Expensive: Honywood Community Science School in Essex admitted that half the iPads given out last year have been broken . It was hoped that the iPads would be a useful learning tool, as well as keep the school up to pace with international competitors embracing the technology in the classroom. But after just one year, more than four in ten of the iPads had been sent off for repair, after being knocked, dropped or scratched. Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act reveal 489 had to be replaced after being found to be beyond repair. About a fifth of those sent for repair – 112 – had to be sent back more than once. Pupils said in some of the younger classes, around half the class had broken their tablet at least once, and some as many as three times. Despite the threat of confiscation after three tablets, ultimately none were taken away from pupils. The school said the iPads have helped improve pupil discipline and exam results . The school argues that since introducing the devices, it has seen improvements in pupil discipline, attendance, and exam results. Apple, the manufacturer of iPads, is said to be aggressively targeting the school market and at the time headteachers were accused of ‘falling for a gimmick’. Honywood, which gained academy status last year, giving it greater control over its budget, gave out the tablets last September, at an estimated cost of £500,000, or  £400 per iPad. Parents were asked only to pay £50 towards insuring  the device. At the time headteacher Simon Mason said the investment represented 2.3 per cent of the school’s budget, and did not want to publicise the scheme for fear of putting the safety of pupils at risk. On the latest figures, he said: ‘The breakage rate resulted from using a recommended case which was insufficiently robust. Since replacing cases this year, breakage has fallen to 1.2 per cent.’ He added: ‘Exam results at the end of our first year of using tablets were the highest in the school’s 48-year history. ‘Attendance has risen and we’ve seen our lowest rate  of fixed-term exclusions for ten years.’ Peter Inson, a former school headmaster and a commentator on education, said the breakages were hardly surprising. He said: ‘In my view you cannot expect children of 11 and 12 to be responsible for a delicate gadget. ‘They are still running around using jumpers for goal- posts and being generally rambunctious.’ Handing out equipment without expecting the parents to contribute financially only increases the likelihood of something being lost or damaged, he added. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Buying technology for schools has to be about educational results, not just trying to appear cutting edge for the sake of it. ‘Not many parents would trust their 11-year-old to look after such an expensive piece of kit so it is wrong for the school to do so just because taxpayers are picking up the bill.’","Honywood Community Science School gave iPad2 to its 1,200 pupils a year ago .

"Traditional nursery rhyme Baa, Baa, Black Sheep has sparked a debate over political correctness after a kindergarten changed its lyrics due to racial implications. Staff at a school in Melbourne's east have expressed their concerns over the connotations of 'black', which has now been altered to mirror Australia's multicultural society. Teachers were also troubled by the line 'one for the little boy who lives down the lane', which they believed had sexist overtones and has since been adjusted, the Herald Sun reports. Scroll down for video . Concerns over the racial connotation of 'black' in the nursery rhyme - Baa, Baa, Black Sheep - prompted the kindergarten teachers to change its lyrics . The school, which has not be named but is located in Melbourne's east, sparked a debate over political correctness for adjusting the lyrics to the tradition rhyme . Staff at the school were also troubled by the sexist implication of the line: 'one for the little boy who lives down the lane' A director of a nearby centre, Bubble Pre-School in Malvern East, says the racial context purely comes from the adult's perspective. 'The kids don't think about that at all when they sing the rhyme,' Roula Tsoukalas told Daily Mail Australia. 'Of course we teach tolerance and acceptance at our school but the song has no focus on the colour itself. From an educational point of view, the repetition of the ""b"" helps children sound the words correctly.' Ms Tsoukalas says Baa, Baa, Black Sheep is 'a classic' and one that is popular among her pupils. 'We often get the kids to choose and they love to sing it all the time,' she said. 'I guess it's also a familiar one for them because many of the kids sing it at home because their parents have also grown up with it.' A spokesman for the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development told Daily Mail Australia they do not decide on what is taught at early childhood centres. Baa, Baa Black Sheep was first published in Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book in 1744 - believed to be the earliest surviving collection of nursery rhymes.","Concerns over the implications of 'black' in the nursery rhyme prompted the change .

"Guilty: Renee Marie King was convicted of  murder, child abuse and criminal sexual conduct for the death of her two-year-old stepdaughter Lily Furneau-Wolfenbarger . A woman has been convicted of murdering and sexually assaulting her two-year-old stepdaughter because she threw a temper tantrum and soiled her pants. It took jurors just two hours to find Renee King, 28, of Macomb County, Michigan, guilty of murder, criminal sexual conduct and child abuse in the November 2010 death of Lily Furneaux-Wolfenbarger. Members of the toddler's family cried with grief as the verdict was read out. Lily's mother Lauren Furneaux . said that though King would not be able to hurt any more children, 'it . still doesn't bring Lily back'. The two-year-old was murdered in her father's trailer park home in New Haven when King was left to look after her. Jeffrey Wolfenbarger, 29, who is married to King, was at work at the time. He and Ms Furneaux had joint custody of the child. During the trial the prosecution argued that Lily was killed simply because she acted like a normal toddler. Assistant Prosecutor Therese Tobin said: 'The price...Lily paid with her life . was because she was acting like a two-year-old that day. 'This defendant wanted to hurt Lily. Lily was acting up, and this is how . she chose to hurt her.' Lily's autopsy showed the 20 injuries to the child's head were consistent with having it slammed into the floor over and over again, the same trauma someone would experience in a car crash. The injuries to her genitals, were comparable to what a woman would experience giving birth, the court heard. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Lily's injuries were said to be consistent with having her head slammed into the floor again and again and her genitals like that a woman experiences in child birth . Mother: Lauren Furneaux said of her daughter's death, 'I fought with everything I had and I failed as a mother, I just want to hold her again' Prosecutors said an object was used to rape the toddler, though exactly what kind of object was not revealed.

Malkiewicz argued that King loved the daughter like she were her own, . according to the Detroit Free Press. He said considering the gravity of charges, deliberations should have taken longer. 'They didn't even ask to see one single exhibit. Shocked is all I can say.' When she was arrested, King told police and relatives that she dropped the two-year-old while in the shower, but investigators said there was evidence found at the home that did not support this.

"American authorities are using the case of three teenage schoolgirls, with a love of pop music and social media, as a unique opportunity to find out how ISIS is targeting young Westerners online. Two sisters, aged 15 and 17, along with their 16-year-old friend, from Colorado, were stopped at Frankfurt airport in Germany on October 20 heading for Syria to join the Islamic terror group. The teen girls were targeted directly via social media by extremist recruiters, the FBI said in a report this week. Recruiters are believed to be encouraging young people by providing travel plans and reinforcing their messages in real-time via sites such as Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. Scroll down for video . ISIS extremists march on Raqqa in Syria, in an image published on the fundamentalists website earlier this year. The FBI are investigating how the terror network uses social media to recruit young Westerners . The suburban apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado where one of the three teenage girls who tried to join ISIS lived with her family. The girls were stopped in October in Germany en route to Syria and returned to their families after being interviewed by the FBI . Online ISIS recruiters are both men and women - who reportedly appeal to teen girls by claiming to be 'ISIS sisters'. They are believed to be operating in Turkey, Syria and Iraq, officials told CNN. The FBI is particularly focusing on contacts in Syria, having searched the girls' computers for clues. Rita Katz, from the SITE Intelligence Group, told CNN that investigators were able to track one of the teen girl's radicalization via her social media posts. Before she was radicalized, she was asked how often she listened to music, Ms Katz said. The girl said she listened to music and danced for a countless number of hours. When she was asked about her music-listening habits in a time after she was radicalized, the teen girl stated that music was forbidden. ISIS methods of luring teens has included creating hashtags linked to current news events, for example the Ebola outbreak. The terrorists also publish videos styled on Hollywood action movies with special effects and voice-overs to entice recruits - stopping short of showing beheadings or extreme violence so as not to deter the initially squeamish. It is believed that 2,000 Westerners have joined ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Among those were the three teens, one of Somali and two of Sudanese descent, from suburban Aurora in Colorado. After they were stopped in Germany on October 20 heading for Turkey to connect with ISIS, authorities sent the girls back to Denver. FBI agents  interviewed the schoolgirls before releasing them to their parents without pressing charges. The father of one girl condemned her actions and said she was confused about what her role would be if she had actually made it to Syria. 'She told me they were going to get there and somebody is going to contact them,' he said, on the condition of anonymity because he was concerned for the girls' safety. Online ISIS recruiters are both men and women who reportedly appeal to teen girls by claiming to be 'ISIS sisters' 'I ask her, ""Who's that person?"" She actually didn't have a clear idea about what's going on. They're just like, you know, stupid little girls. They just want to do something, and they do it.' The father said he became concerned on October 17, when his daughter's high school called to say she had not shown up for classes. He texted her, and she responded that she was just late, but she didn't return home, and her brother mentioned a disturbing Twitter conversation from her account. 'She asked her friends to pray for her because she and the other two girls ... and at that time, I just knew that something really bad was going to happen,' he said. Then, he noticed her passport missing. He called the FBI and his state lawmaker, Rep. Daniel Kagan, for help. Authorities said the girls had saved their money and stole from their parents to buy their tickets in cash at a Lufthansa counter at Denver International Airport. Their overseas trip raised no red flags. The U.S. government doesn't have any restrictions on children flying alone, domestically or internationally. Most U.S. airlines allow children 12 and older to fly alone but often with restrictions on international flights. The girl left behind her laptop, which showed she had been researching whether minors could travel alone and if an entry visa to Turkey was required. The father wasn't sure how his daughter, a typical high school girl who likes going to the movies and the mall, was lured to terrorism online. Officials have said one of the girls had planned the voyage and encouraged the others to come along.

"Brazilian fighter Anderson Silva is speaking out for the first time after his failed doping tests, saying in a statement that he is not a cheater and 'never used any substances' to improve his performances. In the statement published on his Instagram account on Friday, Silva said he has always 'played clean' and is still waiting for the 'results and analysis from the specialists that are working to reveal the truth.' He said the rush to condemn him has been 'unfair.' Brazilian fighter Anderson Silva has failed two drugs tests, one before and one after his comeback . The former UFC middleweight champion insists he has 'never used any substances' to improve his skills . Silva was among the UFC fighters suspended this week after failed drug tests. He is waiting for results from his 'B' samples. The former middleweight champion beat Nick Diaz on Jan. 31 at UFC 183 in his return to the cage after breaking his left leg 13 months ago. Silva started his statement, which was also available through his official website, by saying that what matters 'now is the respect from those who have followed' his career. The 38-year-old won his January 31 fight against Nick Diaz after returning from a broken leg . Silva, speaking to media after beating Diaz, says he has 'always played clean' during his 18-year career . 'I don't know what to apologise for, because I am still waiting for the results and analysis from the specialists that are working to reveal the truth,' Silva said. 'Everything that I took since my injury are being analyzed. I look for the truth as much as all those who were surprised with the results. I always played clean, I was never a cheater.' The 39-year-old Brazilian said he would 'never risk' jeopardizing a career that he 'took so long to build.' 'I think that the hurry some people have to condemn me is unfair,' Silva said. 'The time it takes to destroy a reputation is infinitely less than that is taken to build it. I want those who have always supported me to know that I am still fighting for all the sad happenings of this situation to be cleared.' Defeated Diaz (left) also faces a hearing on February 17 after testing positive to marijuana metabolites . Silva noted that during his 18-year career he never failed any doping tests. 'In and out of the octagon I never slipped in compliance with the principles that always guided me. With much honor and dignity I defended my country where ever I fought,' Silva said. 'I never used any substances to better my performance in my fights.' Diaz and Hector Lombard were the other two high-profile fighters temporary suspended by UFC this week, prompting the world's leading MMA promotion to announce the launch of a multimillion-dollar anti-doping plan in which all fighters will be subject to random performance-enhancing drug testing beginning in July.","Brazilian UFC fighter has responded after failing two doping tests .

"A top cop has issued a stark warning to 'predatory' men in the police force who commit sexual harassment and violence against women. In announcing the new review Chief Commissioner Ken Lay for Victorian Police says he 'loves' the force but that type of behaviour will not be accepted.

'We have a number of investigations looking into the shameless conduct by our people. 'A small percentage of our members target and relentlessly take advantage of women by using their power and influence.

"Supporters of a Texas double murderer slated to by executed next month for two 1992 slayings are petitioning the sate to commute his sentence to life in prison. Scott Panetti, who wore a cowboy outfit as he represented himself at his 1995 trial where he tried to subpoena Jesus and JFK, was finally given an execution date of December 3 after years of appeals. On Wednesday, Greg Wiercioch and the schizophrenic 56-year-old's other attorneys asked the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and Governor Rick Perry for a stay of execution,Courthouse News reports. 'The case of Scott Louis Panetti is a judicial disaster that has attracted national and international outrage - and for good reason,' Wiercioch said. 'Evidence of his incompetency runs like a fissure through every proceeding in his case - from arraignment to execution.' Scroll down to read petition... Will he be put to death? On Wednesday, Greg Wiercioch (left) and schizophrenic 56-year-old double murderer Scott Panetti's (right) other attorneys asked the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and Governor Rick Perry for a stay of execution . He said the execution 'would cross a moral line.' Panetti gunned down his wife's parents as she and their child watched in 1992. Attorneys say it was the result of a 'psychotic break,' Panetti suffered. The case has appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court at least three times over the years as his supporters maneuvered to prove he's mentally unfit to be put to death. The most recent was early in October when the justices refused to review his latest appeal. State attorneys have argued he exaggerates some of his symptoms to avoid execution. Panetti was convicted of fatally shooting his in-laws, Joe and Amanda Alvarado, at their Fredericksburg home. Read a plea from Panetti's supporters... Delusional? Attorneys contend Panetti is so delusional that he can't understand why he was convicted and condemned. Here, he's pictured with his mother and father . His wife was living with her parents and a week earlier had obtained a court order to keep Panetti away. His wife and 3-year-old daughter, were sprayed with blood when Panetti shot his in-laws. They were held hostage until he surrendered after a lengthy standoff with police. He blamed it all on 'Sarge,' one of his multiple personalities. His trial judge assigned Panetti a standby attorney after he chose to be his own lawyer at his 1995 trial, where he wore a purple cowboy outfit, flipped a coin to select a juror and wanted to subpoena Jesus Christ and John F. Kennedy as witnesses. He insisted only an insane person could prove insanity. 'Scott Panetti is not competent for execution and therefore his execution would serve no retributive purpose,' his appeals attorney, Greg Wiercioch, said Thursday. 'It is unfortunate that an execution date has been set. Always has a bible: Panetti already had a history of mental problems before the shooting, recording 14 hospital stays over 11 years. He's seen here with his brother . 'He has a fixed delusion that Satan, working through the state of Texas, is seeking to execute him for preaching the Gospel. His execution would be a miserable spectacle.' A day before he was to die in 2007, the Supreme Court stopped Panetti's scheduled execution for further review by lower courts. I just wanted to see my wife,' Panetti, in a taped statement played at his capital murder trial, explained why he went to the home armed with a rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and three knives and dressed in camouflage clothing. 'I put on my combat stuff so if I was cornered, I wanted to have my equipment. It was like I wasn't even in control, like someone else was pushing me.' His wife and 3-year-old daughter, sprayed with blood when Panetti shot his in-laws, were held hostage until he surrendered after a lengthy standoff with police. He blamed it all on 'Sarge,' one of his multiple personalities. Previous stay: Now aged 56, a day before he was to die in 2007, the Supreme Court stopped Panetti's scheduled execution for further review by lower courts . Horrific crime: Panetti, at right on a horse with his wife and child, murdered his in-laws as his wife and daughter were splattered with their blood in 1992 . During jury selection at his trial, he flipped a coin to decide whether a juror should be put on his panel, fired his lawyers and insisted on defending himself. He submitted an initial witness list that sought 200 subpoenas, including Jesus Christ and John F. Kennedy. He showed up for court dressed in cowboy clothing that mimicked Western B-movie star Tom Mix, complete with a big cowboy hat dangling on a string across his back. He took the stand in the identity of 'Sarge,' speaking in staccato non-sentences: 'Boom, boom, blood, blood.' Jurors rejected his defense of not guilty by reason of insanity, convicted him and sentenced him to death. Panetti had moved to Texas with his parents in the 1970s. He worked as a ranchhand — his occupation on prison documents is listed as blacksmith — and already had a history of mental problems before the shooting, recording 14 hospital stays over 11 years. He told lawyers his scheduled punishment was part of a satanic conspiracy to prevent him from preaching the gospel. At a federal evidentiary hearing, defense medical experts said while he understood he was to be executed, he did not connect the murders as the reason for the punishment. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to stop the execution, but the Supreme Court subsequently agreed to consider his case. Panetti had moved to Texas with his parents in the 1970s.

"The United States once had Islamic State of . Iraq and al-Shams (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi in custody at a detention facility in Iraq, but president Barack Obama let him go, it was revealed on Friday. Al Baghdadi was among the prisoners released in 2009 from the U.S.'s now-closed Camp Bucca near Umm Qasr in Iraq. But now five years later he is leading the army of ruthless . extremists bearing down on Baghdad who want to turn the country into an . Islamist state by blazing a bloody trail through towns and cities, executing . Iraqi soldiers, beheading police officers and gunning down innocent civilians. Scroll down for video . These are the only two known photos of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He is seen here on the left as a prisoner half a decade ago and on the right more recently as the shadowy head of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, also known as ISIS . This uundated handout picture of jihadi leader of The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, also known as Abu Du'a, was provided by the Department of State. The U.S. government has a $10 million bounty out for the al Qaeda leader . It is unclear why the U.S. let the merciless al Qaeda leader slip away, however, one theory proposed by The Telegraph . is that al Baghadadi was granted amnesty along with thousands of other . detainees because the U.S. was preparing to pull out of Iraq. The United States began withdrawing troops from Iraq in 2010,and Camp Bucca closed in 2011 along with the United States' other military facilities as President Obama declared that the War in Iraq had come to an end. Another possible explanation is that al Baghadadi did not become a jihadist until after his release from Camp Bucca. The story of how Baghadadi ended up in U.S. custody in the first place and later came to be the leader of a violent terrorist group is the stuff of legend. It is said by some that al Baghadadi was in the wrong place at the wrong time when he was picked up by the U.S. military, a farmer who got caught up in a massive sweep. It was at Camp Bucca that he was radicalized and became a follower of Osama Bin Laden. Another version of the story is that al Baghadadi, who also goes by the alias of Abu Duaa, was an Islamic fundamentalist before the U.S. invaded Iraq and he became a leader in al Qaeda's network before he was arrested and detained by American forces in 2005. 'Abu Duaa was connected to the intimidation, torture and murder of local . civilians in Qaim,' according to a 2005 U.S. intelligence report. 'He would kidnap individuals . or entire families, accuse them, pronounce sentence and then publicly . execute them.' Crazed: Jihadists are carrying out summary executions on civilians, soldiers and police officers including this police major after taking control of large swathes of Iraq . Shock and awe: An ISIS propaganda video shows militants blindfolding a Sunni police major in his home before cutting off his head . Barbaric: This picture of the police officer's decapitated head resting on his legs was tweeted with the message: 'This is our ball. It is made of skin#WorldCup' The U.S. now has a $10 million warrant out out of the brute, who is accused of . bombing a mosque in Baghadad in 2011 and killing former Sunni lawmaker . Khalid al-Fahdawl. Al . Baghadadi's use of aliases has made him a difficult man to pin down. The terrorist organizer rarely shows his face - even to his followers. There are only two known pictures of him in existence, and one is from before he was released from prison. 'We either arrested or killed a man of that name about half a dozen times, he . is like a wraith who keeps reappearing, and I am not sure where fact and . fiction meet,' Lieutenant-General Sir Graeme Lamb, a former British . special forces commander, told The Telegraph. 'There are those who want to promote the idea that this man is invincible, . when it may actually be several people using the same nom de guerre.' Al Baghadadi and his troops had already taken key cities of Fallujah and Ramadi in Iraq earlier this year and have conquered the Iraqi cities of Tikrit and Mosul within the last several days. They are now on the war path to Iraq's capitol city Baghadad. The terrorist group's sudden rise in Iraq has taken the United States mostly by surprise. President Obama famously said in October of 2011 that the American soldiers leaving Iraq would come home 'with their heads held high, proud of their success. 'That is how America’s military efforts in Iraq will end.' President Obama reiterated on Friday that, 'We will not be sending us troops back into combat in Iraq' Faced with the real possibility that Iraq's capitol could fall into the hands of terrorists, President Obama is now rethinking America's military engagement in Iraq. The president said on Thursday that he would consider launching air strikes on al Baghadadi and his followers. 'What . we've seen over the last couple of days indicates Iraq’s going to need . more help' from the United States and other nations, Obama said yesterday from the . Oval Office. 'I . don't rule out anything,' he said, 'because we do have a stake in making . sure that these jihadists are not getting a permanent foothold in Iraq – . or Syria, for that matter.' In . his daily briefing with reporters, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney clarified that president Obama was specifically referring to airstrikes. 'We're not considering boots on the ground,' he said. On the warpath to Baghdad: A graphic showing the town and cities captured by ISIS over the last few days .

Sabre-rattling: An Islamic militant issues a call to arms, saying: 'Declare Allah the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest!' in a video released by ISIS . President Obama reiterated on Friday that, 'We will not be sending us troops back . into combat in Iraq.' Obama said the U.S. would not get involved at all militarily until Iraqi President Nouri al-Maliki and other members of the government demonstrate that they can put aside their secretarian differences and work toward unifying the country. 'Ultimately it's up to Iraqis to solve their problems,' Obama said. Volunteers who have joined the Iraqi Army to fight against the predominantly Sunni militants, who have taken over Mosul and other Northern provinces, gesture from an army truck . Kurdish Peshmerga forces seize the control of Kirkuk where Iraqi army forces and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant clashed . The news that the U.S. may have played a role in the rise of the new Osama bin Laden comes just a week after President Obama released five Taliban commanders in exchange for a U.S. solider being held hostage by the terrorist network. Lawmakers immediately questioned the logic of the president's decision, saying that the move could end up backfiring on the U.S. if the five fighters return to the battlefield in Afghanistan once their mandatory one-year stay in Qatar comes to a close. They are especially concerned given the president's announcement just days before their release that he plans to withdraw the majority of America's troops in Afghanistan by the end of this year. Already one, of the Taliban 5 have vowed to return to Afghanistan to fight American soldiers there once he is able. 'I wouldn't be doing it if I thought that it was contrary to American national security,' the president said at the time.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"The ex-wife of an Oklahoma oil tycoon who was awarded cash and assets worth more than $1 billion in the couple's divorce, plans to appeal the judgment on grounds that it grossly undervalued the marital wealth she is entitled to. Sue Ann Hamm claims she was short-changed by this week's ruling even though it was one of the biggest divorce payouts in history. Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm was allowed by an Oklahoma County judge to keep nearly all of an estimated $18 billion rise in his company shares that occurred during their 26-year marriage. Harold Hamm was ordered by an Oklahoma County judge to hand over close to $1 billion to his ex-wife Sue Ann Hamm this week, but she has revealed that she plans to contest the decision and believes she was entitled to more . ‘Sue Ann is disappointed in the outcome of this case. She dedicated 25 years as Harold’s faithful partner in family and business,’ said Ron Barber, one of the attorneys on her legal team, told Reuters on Thursday. Special Judge Howard Haralson found that Hamm, 68, should pay Mrs Hamm a total of $995.5 million, with about a third of the funds, or $322.7 million, to be paid by the end of the year, the filing revealed. Hamm will then be required to pay the rest of the judgment, some $650 million, in installments worth at least $7 million per month. She was also awarded additional assets, including a California ranch and an Oklahoma home, worth tens of millions more. Sue Ann Hamm has already been awarded around $25 million since the case was filed in 2012. To secure the judgment, Judge Haralson has placed a lien on 20 million shares of Continental stock. The ruling, which is subject to appeal, comes after a ten-week divorce trial which ended last month. Forbes named the oil tycoon the 30th richest person in the U.S. in 2012 and 76th richest person in the world. His fortune is estimated at $14billion today . Hamm started Continental in 1967, and about 68 per cent of the firm's shares are in his name. His stake was worth more than $18 billion when the trial started in August. It's worth around $13.5 billion today. Since the couple wed in 1988, Continental has grown from a small-time driller worth less than $50 million into a $20 billion behemoth and one of Oklahoma's largest companies. Because Harold owned his shares before he and Sue Ann were married, they belong to him. But under Oklahoma law, their 'active' appreciation since 1988 is subject to 'equitable distribution' with Sue Ann, a former executive at Continental who filed for divorce from Harold in 2012. Her legal team contends that the amount of marital wealth the court should divide is more than $17 billion, a sum that included most of Harold's stake in Continental a few months before the trial began. The Hamms own four houses together including this vast property in an exclusive enclave of Nichols Hills, Oklahoma . High-life: Sue Ann Hamm and the couple's daughter Jane are pictured at a lunch for the Wall Street Journal Innovator of Year award . In a court filing from 2013, Mrs Hamm alleged that her husband was having an affair, which prompted her to file for divorce. Mrs Hamm, 56, has held key posts at Continental, but she no longer works for the company. Court filings showed that his attorneys argued that the couple's shared wealth is a tiny fraction of that amount. The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement. Harold Hamm's leadership at Continental is central to the case. In court, his lawyers attributed most of Continental's success not to Hamm's business savvy but to factors beyond his control - that market factors such as rising oil prices, or decisions made prior to marriage caused Continental's growth. The trial ended on October 9. In Oklahoma, a divorce appeal can be heard by a State Court of Appeals panel or the Oklahoma Supreme Court. A higher court could review the case and affirm Haralson’s judgment, or modify the award. It could also send the case back to Haralson to be re-tried. Family law experts say the process could take anywhere from 18 months to several years. Video Source YouTube . Harold Hamm pictured with Mitt Romney during his run for the White House. The oil tycoon donated close to $1million to the Republican candidate's campaign . This is the second divorce for Hamm after he divorced his first wife, Judith Ann, in 1987. They have three children together. In 1988, Hamm married Sue Ann, an economist and lawyer. The couple had two daughters, Jane and Hillary. The oil magnate lives in Oklahoma City and owns homes in Enid, Oklahoma and Nichols Hills, Oklahoma. The vast Nichols Hills property is believed to be worth in the region of $3million. Forbes named him the 30th richest person in the U.S. in 2012 and 76th richest person in the world. He had humble beginnings, growing up in rural Oklahoma where he was the 13th child of Oklahoma cotton sharecroppers. Hamm, pictured at his boyhood home in Lexington, Oklahoma, had humble beginnings as the 13th child of cotton sharecroppers . Mr Hamm spent his youth picking cotton, before starting his career at 20 by scrubbing the scum out of oil barrels. He worked his way up and was eventually able to drill his own wells. Fond of eating at burger bars, Mr Hamm has a reputation for being down-to-earth and drives his own truck. His big breakthrough came in the Nineties, when he helped discover the Bakken field of North Dakota, the largest new U.S. oil prospect since the Sixties. Mr Hamm is a staunch Republican and donated close to a million dollars to Mitt Romney's presidential bid in 2012.","Harold Hamm was ordered by an Oklahoma judge to hand over close to $1 billion to his ex-wife Sue Ann Hamm .

"You have to wonder whether John Bostock ever crossed Dele Alli's mind when he signed for Tottenham on Monday. Like Bostock before him, Alli - one of the hottest prospects outside the Barclays Premier League - has taken the decision to continue his footballing development at White Hart Lane. Alli will hope, however, that's where the similarities will end. Tottenham signed 18-year-old Dele Alli on transfer deadline day before loaning him back to MK Dons . The 18-year-old has impressed for MK Dons this season and attracted interest from a number of top clubs . Alli was recently named League One player of the month while Karl Robinson won manager of the month . Spurs were convinced they'd signed the future England captain when they plucked Bostock from Crystal Palace in a hugely controversial move back in 2008. As we know, it didn't turn out that way; Bostock made four substitute appearances for Spurs in five years. His failure to make the grade remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern-day English football. Fast-forward seven years and Alli, when he joins Tottenham next season, will be hoping for a much different outcome. He'll be joined by young central-defender Milos Veljkovic, who is well-placed to discuss the obstacles facing Alli when he arrives in the summer. The Serbia Under-21 international has been at White Hart Lane since he was 15 - arriving from Swiss club FC Basel. The MK Dons youngster has scored 12 goals in 32 appearances for the League One side so far this season . After signing from Crystal Palace back in 2008, Bostock endured a frustrating spell at Tottenham . Having made three senior appearances for the club, Veljkovic spent a spell at Middlesbrough before joining Charlton on loan until the end of the season. Veljkovic will head back to White Hart Lane in the summer intent on, like Alli, proving his worth to Mauricio Pochettino. And the 19-year-old says the arrival of the Argentine manager means youngsters like Alli and himself will now be given a fair crack of the whip. 'The manager has shown he is ready to give young players a chance,' Veljkovic told Sportsmail. 'And there is John McDermott (academy manager), and Paul Mitchell (head of recruitment and analysis) as well, they are looking for the youth. 'There are now more training sessions with first team for the Under-21s and the first team coaches are having a look at the U21s more often now; it wasn't like this in the past so its getting better.' However, Alli shouldn't expect to walk straight into Pochettino's first-team plans next season. Having played regularly in Tottenham's pre-season tour of the USA last year, Veljkovic found first-team opportunities hard to come by when the season started - prompting his loan moves to Middlesbrough and Charlton. 'I don't know too much about Alli, but I think it'll be the same for him as me,' said Veljkovic. 'Maybe he will play for the U21's, and then train with the first team and if he's good enough he could make the bench. Milos Velkjovic hopes to impress Mauricio Pochettino in pre-season, just like Alli will be hoping to do so . The 19-year-old (left) battles for the ball with Barnsley's Kane Hemmings in the FA Cup third round . The Serbia Under 21 defender puts in a challenge on Spain's Gerard Deulofeu in October 2014 . 'It'll be step-by-step. Maybe he could go on loan, which was the right step for me. 'The manager said to me in the summer that he wanted me to go to America with them, so I went and played quite a bit. 'But when the season started, in my position there is quite a few players. I gave 100 percent but it was difficult. 'I didn't really get an opportunity, so I spoke with the gaffer and he told me I needed more experience so that's why I went on loan. 'But the manager will give you a chance, so my plan is to play as much as I can at Charlton and then go back to Spurs for pre-season and impress the manager.' You won't be the only one, Milos.","Dele Alli joined Tottenham from MK Dons for £5million on deadline day .

"A shopper was given a nasty shock while preparing a pork casserole recipe - when he discovered an inch-long beetle festering in the packet of pork. Shiva Govinden, 36, from Tarring in West Sussex, was appalled when he found the bug inside the pork belly slices from Tesco. Mr Govinden, a special needs teaching assistant, was so disgusted he immediately returned the British pork belly slices to his local Tesco Express store and demanded an apology. Shiva Govinden found the beetle inside the British pork belly he was about to serve up in a casserole . He said it had taken the supermarket six weeks to investigate his case and vowed to never return to the chain. He said: 'It was pretty disgusting. I just put it into the casserole dish ready to go into the oven and there was a beetle an inch-long. 'I took it back to them straight away. 'I feel extremely disappointed about the length of time taken by Tesco to commence an investigation into what is a public safety issue and a very poor standard of customer service. 'I hope that Tesco learn to improve their food safety and investigative procedures as it should not take over six weeks to confirm what type of beetle was found in one of their pork belly packets. 'It's appalling. They are treating it as if it's just another foreign body. 'If you've got one thing like that then surely you want to get to the bottom of it straight away. 'It's just not right. You wouldn't accept it from a restaurant, so why a supermarket?' Mr Govinden said he was 'disgusted' by his discovery and vowed to never return to Tesco . And the disgusted shopper said he would never shop at Tesco again. He added: 'They treat loyal customers like animals and serve them food not fit for pigs.' A Tesco spokesman said: 'We set ourselves extremely high standards for our food and were disappointed to hear of this incident. 'We appreciate Mr Govinden returning the product to us so our suppliers can investigate and we have offered him a gesture of goodwill.'","Shiva Govinden found the beetle in the pork while preparing a casserole .

"He was a celebrated symbol of peace and democracy the world over. But in the last years of his life, Nelson Mandela's own family has been at war, bickering between themselves over his many millions. And in the wake of the anti-apartheid leader's death at 95 today, it is feared his surviving family will be plunged in to deep rifts over who stands to gain his fortune. Mandela was married three times and fathered six children - only three of whom, his daughters Makaziwe, Zenani 'Zeni' and Zindziswa, are still alive. Scroll down for video . Bitter dispute: Makaziwe Mandela, left, and her . sister Zenani, right with Nelson Mandela, are locked in a legal wrangle . with two of their father's oldest friends over a £1million trust fund . set up by the former South African president in 2005 . 'Lost trust': Nelson Mandela is said to have put £1million of his money in a trust fund to stop his family arguing over it . Legal rows: Nelson Mandela, centre, is surrounded by his grandchildren - many of whom supported a legal bid to gain control of a Mandela art merchandise company - at his house in Qunu, Eastern Cape, on his 90th birthday . His daughter Makaziwe, from his first marriage, and Zenani, from his second marriage, have reportedly already become embroiled in a legal battle earlier this year over the control of a £1million trust fund. Mr Mandela's third daughter, Zindzi, is not involved in the court action, the Star of South Africa reported. The money was placed in the fund by Mr Mandela in 2005 to be distributed to his daughters only in the event of hardship as he wanted them to forge a career of their own rather than live off his money. He is said to have set up around 27 such funds over the years after 'losing trust' in his children with the money intended to last generations for 'specific circumstances' and not general use. But Makaziwe and Zanani are demanding access to the fund and have begun legal action against the trust's two directors; 84-year-old lawyer George Bizos, who defended Mandela in the 1963 Rivonia Trial, and 60-year-old Tokyo Sexwale who was a prisoner alongside Mandela on Robben Island. Legal action: Two of Mandela's daughters are . suing for control of the trust, which is under the control of lawyer . George Bizos (pictured in 1991, left) and Tokyo Sexwale, right . Family . affair: Nelson Mandela with his daughter Princess Zenani Dlamini, . centre, and her daughters Zaziwe Manaway, pictured left holding baby . Ziphokazi Manaway, and Zamaswazi Dlamini pictured right holding baby . Zamakhosi Obiri last year. Zaziwe appeared in the reality TV show 'Being . Mandela' earlier this year . Supported by almost all of Mr Mandela's grandchildren, Makaziwe and Zenani allege that the trust was intended for them and that Mr Bizos and Mr Sexwale 'hijacked' it. Makaziwe and Zenani have also launched a legal battle against the same two men and another lawyer Bally Chuene who are all directors of companies whose main purpose was to channel funds from the sale of  Mandela's handprints. The two daughters claim that Bizos, Sexwale and Chuene were never appointed by Mandela as major shareholders or directors. Bizos claims the allegations are completely false. It is understood that Mandela has accumulated a fortune of more than £10million from his many autobiographies, intellectual work and after turning his family name in to a brand - a move his family have been more than happy to take advantage of. The family is active in more than 110 trading companies, according to records compiled by Beeld newspaper. Famous name: Swati Dlamini, left, and Zaziwe Dlamini-Manaway, star in reality show 'Being Mandela' Trade name: Nelson Mandela's daughter Makaziwe, pictured left with United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa at a Pretoria hospital to visit Mandela on Monday, runs the House of Mandela wine company . His daughter Makaziwe has founded the House of Mandela wine label and is reportedly an active director in 16 other companies, although she insists some directorships have lapsed. Addressing claims that the Mandela family are exploiting their name, Makaziwe has been quoted as saying: 'It's our name anyway. Why should we apologise for our name? 'I'm in the wine industry. There are families who've been in the wine industry for 500 years and no one says they are cashing in on their name. 'Every child in this family who wants to use the Mandela name has a right to do, so as long as they do so with honour and integrity and upholding the values of my father.' Meanwhile, many of his grandchildren control other franchise companies or products. He has 17 grandchildren and a growing number of great-grandchildren - several of whom have been accused of trying to make money off the back of their family ties with the famous leader. Nelson Mandela married three times, fathering six children, only three of whom are alive today. Mandela married his first wife Evelyn Ntoko Mase in 1944 but they divorced 13 years later. The couple had two sons, Madiba 'Thembi' Thembekile, who died in 1969, and Makgatho Mandela who died in 2005. They had a daughter named Makaziwe 'Maki' Mandela who died a few months after being born in 1947 and named their second daughter in her honour. He married his second wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in 1957 and they divorced in 1996. They had two daughters, Zenani 'Zeni' and Zindziswa 'Zindzi' Mandela-Hlongwane. Mandela remarried on his 80th birthday in 1998 to Graça Machel who he was still married to at the time of his death. He has 17 grandchildren - the oldest born in 1965 and the youngest in 1992 - and a growing number of great-grandchildren. Two of his granddaughters - Zenani's two daughters Zaziwe Dlamini-Manaway and Swati Dlamini who are both in their 30s - appeared in a reality TV show called 'Being Mandela'. While the 94-year-old former South African president does not appear in the show, his second wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela - 'Big Mommy' to her grandchildren - has a central role. The sisters, along with two brothers, also launched a fashion line, called 'Long Walk to Freedom' in honour of their grandfather's autobiography. Many family members have also become embroiled in scandals - with his grandson Mandla Mandela being accused of bigamy when he wed French teenager Anais Grimaud while still apparently married to his first wife. The pair then later split when the couple's child was alleged to have been fathered by one of his brothers. Mandla is the oldest son of Nelson's late son Makgatho. He was born in 1974, followed by Ndaba (1983), Mbusu (1991) and Andile (1993). It is not known which brother was involved with his wife. Mandla has also been accused in the past of trying to sell the TV coverage rights to his grandfather's funeral for £225,000. Family members have also accused Mandla of wanting to evict a cousin from her home near Johannesburg in order to turn it into a tourist attraction. Mandela denied the allegations. As well as financial rifts and court battles, Mandela's family has also been struck by many tragedies over the years. His son, Makgatho Mandela died of AIDS in 2005 and Mandela's great-granddaughter, 13-year-old Zenani Mandela, was killed in a car crash caused by a driver travelling at twice the 80km/h speed limit on a motorway in South Africa in 2010.","Nelson Mandela died after being admitted to hospital .

"Nick Clegg is to launch an ‘aggressive’ defence of the European Union in a direct challenge to the rise of the UK Independence Party. The Liberal Democrat leader will use his New Year message next week to pitch his party as the only one ‘fully committed’ to Britain remaining in the EU. He will argue that with a tide of Eurosceptism engulfing the Tories and Labour wavering about even promising a referendum, only the Lib Dems will make the case as the ‘party of in’. Aggressive: Nick Clegg will pitch the Lib Dems into the battle over Europe as the only party which unequivocally wants to stay in the EU . It is a high risk strategy, with some Lib Dem insiders fearing the party could be pushed into fifth place at next year’s elections to the European Parliament, behind UKIP, the Conservatives, Labour and even the Greens. In 2009 the Lib Dems polled almost 14 per cent of the vote, but strategists think it could be halved to just 7 per cent in May. However, it is understood Mr Clegg has rejected advice to play down his pro-European views at a time when the Eurosceptic UKIP is in the ascendency. Instead he hopes to appeal to the third of voters who want to remain in the EU as it stands, even without the renegotiation promised by David Cameron after the next election. UKIP leader Nigel Farage predicts his party will top the polls in May despite David Cameron's promise of an in-out referendum by 2017 . The Tories have promised to hold an in-out referendum on leaving the EU by 2017, but Mr Clegg has argued it would create unnecessary uncertainty. He plans to contrast his clear stance with that of UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who wants Britain to leave the EU altogether. Mr Clegg will use the European elections to argue that abandoning the EU would damage jobs in the UK, hamper police in fighting crime, setback the fight against climate change and undermine Britain’s standing in the world. A senior Lib Dem source said: 'Between March and May the Liberal Democrats will fight an unashamedly pro-Eurorpean campaign as the party of ""in"". 'We will present ourselves as the only party fully committed to being in. We will seek to polarise the debate with UKIP.' Mr Farage has . boasted that he will trigger a ‘political earthquake’ by topping the . polls in May’s elections to the European Parliament. Popular: During 2013 UKIP has cemented its lead in the polls over the Liberal Democrats, ending the year on 10 per cent, according to IpsosMORI . UKIP is expected to capitalise on the . lifting of work restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians from January by . arguing that only by leaving the EU can Britain take back control of . its borders. The source added: 'We might not agree with UKIP but we are both very clear where we stand. They are the party of out, and we are the party of in. 'Nobody argues the case for reform more passionately than Nick Clegg. 'But the Lib Dems have always believed you reform Brussels to work better for Britain by having a seat at the top table and leading those debates.'","Lib Dem leader in high-risk drive to make the case for Brussels .

"Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky easily won election by fellow Republicans on Thursday to become Senate majority leader when the new Congress convenes in January, fulfilling a long-held ambition. As majority leader, McConnell will set the Senate's agenda. Along with House Speaker John Boehner, who was reelected to the top spot in the House today, McConnell will decide what legislation is sent to the White House in the final two years of President Barack Obama's term. Also reelected to his party's leadership today was current Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who will slide into the minority leader position at the beginning of next year. Scroll down for video . Couldn't be happier: Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, front, fulfilled a long-held ambition today when he was unanimously elected by his party to become the next majority leader of the Senate. He currently serves as minority leader, but he'll take the top spot in January when the next legislative session begins . McConnell, 72, was chosen by acclamation at a closed-door meeting of the rank and file this morning. The Kentucky lawmaker was elected to a sixth Senate term last week in off-year elections in which Republicans gained a majority for the first time in eight years. He will formally assume his duties as majority leader in January. Democrats have assailed him in recent campaigns as a guardian of gridlock for his opposition to nearly all of President Barack Obama's initiatives. Senate Republicans had only one contested leadership race, and that was for chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Current chairman, Jerry Moran of Kansas, was not interested in retaining the position. In the end, Republicans selected Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi to chair the party's campaign committee for the 2016 elections. He defeated Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada. Wicker said at a press conference afterward that it was always a 'race between friends' and 'a contest decided among friends,' and the two men began and ended the election process that way. A relatively unknown lawmaker, it will now become Wicker's duty to help Republicans retain the Senate beyond their current two-year mandate. Republican members of the Senate also reelected Texas Sen. John Cornyn to the party's whip spot, Wyoming Sen. John Barasso as chairman of the policy committee, South Dakota Sen. John Thune to GOP conference chairman and Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt to vice chair of the Senate Republican Conference. McConnell, center, walks with members of the Republican Senate leadership for the 114th Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington  today. With McConnell from left are Senators John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, John Cornyn of Texas and John Thune of South Dakota . While the voting sessions were celebratory occasions for Republicans, they were the exact opposite for Democrats, who took a pounding in the Nov. 4 midterm elections. After eight years in the minority, Senate Republicans picked up at least eight seats from Democrats and are still hoping for a ninth in a Louisiana runoff set for Dec. 6. The party also padded its majority in the House, where a handful of races remain unresolved. Republicans are on track to equal or eclipse the 246 they won in 1946, a figure that stands as a post-World War II high. Despite sizable election losses, Democrats appeared ready to hand their own leaders another two years at the helm on Thursday, postponing a generational change that appears not far in the future. Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, a few weeks shy of his 75th birthday, was selected as the minority leader in the new Congress, but members of the rank and file made it known they were unhappy with his leadership in the last election cycle. First elected as Democratic leader in 2004, at least two senators, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Manchin of West Virginia wanted to see a change in management and asked for the leadership vote to be delayed by a week. But the vote was held any way, and so they refused to vote for Reid in order to send a message to their colleagues. 'We’ve got to stick to our knitting and make sure that we’re talking about things that we want to do for the American people instead of talking about winning elections,' McCaskill told reporters after the meeting, according to the Washington Post. 'That means making this place functional again and working with our Republican colleagues.' The end result of the three and a half-hour meeting was that Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a progressive favorite, was given a seat at the leadership table in a newly created position. According to the Huffington Post, she will become an adviser to the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee and will help shape the party's positions on issues and legislative priorities. A source familiar with the discussions told the news publication that Warren will also serve as a liason to progressive groups. Also added to leadership was Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who will becme the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee chairwoman. Sen. John Tester, a second-term moderate from Montana, was selected to head of the party's Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for 2016. 'We’re going to expand our leadership, we’re going to do things a little differently, a little different approach,' Reid said when he emerged from the closed-door meeting. Remaining at the top of the party's pecking order are Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the assistant Democratic leader, New York Sen. Charles 'Chuck' Schumer, vice chair of the Democratic conference and chair of the Democratic policy committee, Washington Sen. Patty Murray, secretary of the Democratic Conference and Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, vice chair of the policy committee. Hard knock: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was selected by his colleagues to lead the party again next year, but because of last Tuesday's midterm election losses he will be demoted to minority leader of the Senate in the new Congress . Leading progressive voice Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was added to her party's leadership slate today. The Massachusetts senator will serve as an adviser to their policy committee and a liaison to progressives . At the same time, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, 74, is expected to be elected to a new term as House Democratic leader when the rank-and-file meets next week. She first won her post a dozen years ago. Pelosi was speaker for four years when Democrats held the majority, and has served as minority leader for eight. She said during a press conference today that she would not step aside as her party's leader despite the recent losses and finds it sexist that reporters would even ask her about it when they made no such overtures to the men who lead the Republican Party when they were on the losing side. House Republicans held their leadership elections today, and as expected, no major shake-ups occurred. The Speaker's gavel stayed with Boehner of Ohio, and Kevin McCarthy of California will remain the party's majority leader,a position he won this summer after the previous holder, former Rep. Eric Cantor, lost his primary election and subsequently left Congress before the end of his term. When McCarthy moved up in leadership, Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise took his position as the party's whip, a job he was reelected today today. The Houses's campaign committee chair, Greg Walden of Oregon, and conference chair, Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, were also reelected. The only change to leadership was the replacement of Oklahoma Rep. James Lankford as policy committee chair. Senator-elect Lankford will be succeeded by first-term Indiana Rep. Luke Messer. Speaker of the House John Boehner, center,  holds news conference with the newly-elected members of the House GOP leadership team. From left they are: Rep. Patrick McHenry, Rep. Virginia Foxx, Rep. Luke Messer, Rep. Mimi Walters, Rep. Ann Wagner, Majority Whip Steve Scalise,  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, National Congressional Campaign Committee chairman Greg Walden and GOP Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers . While none of the Republican leaders faced public opposition before today's closed-door meetings, they could hand their hands full come January as they try to wrangle votes and keep the conservative wing of the GOP in line. Asked about potential tension between the establishment members and the Tea Party faction in the Senate, Thune said the GOP's coalitions in the Senate understand that they have to stick together. 'We know that in order for us to succeed we’re going to have to function as a team and I think that gives you a renewed sense of purpose,' Thune told reporters today, according to the Dallas Morning News. 'Those things tend to be more evident in the minority, but in the majority – for sure we’re going to have disagreements. We have different folks who come from different places and have different views on issues, he added. 'But when it comes to being successful in terms of trying to move an agenda I think we all recognize we have to work together as a team.' As for as working with Democrats goes, Thune said at a press conference today, 'It's gonna be up to them. The ball's gonna be in their court.' The South Dakota Republican said that members of his party 'look forward to bipartisan cooperation' and getting the 'peoples' government' working again. Likewise, Blunt said he was 'optimistic' that Democrats and Republicans could come to an agreement on a number of issues. 'Frankly, the president's going to engage one way or another,' he said, turning serious. 'He'll either have to engage the day the bill lines up on his desk....or decide to engage earlier in a way that we might be able to do hard things together,' Blunt argued. The GOP leader said its important the Senate gets 'those hard things out of the way' so it can focus on passing laws that aid private sector job creation, which leads to good take-home pay. Acknowledging that in just two years it will be Republicans who have 24 seats to defend in the Senate, Wicker told reporters that 'winning in 2016 begins with good government and good legislation,' and that's how Republicans plan to lead.","Sen.

"Quite what the little boy who lives down the lane would make of it is open to conjecture. But parents at one school made their feelings plain when they heard their children reciting ‘Baa Baa Little Sheep’. They accused the £2,700-a-term Park Hill primary school of changing the words from ‘Baa Baa Black Sheep’ for the sake of political correctness. Political correctness gone mad: At their Easter concert, pupils at Park Hill School swapped the word 'black' in Baa Baa Black Sheep for 'little' as they sang . Bemused: Andrea Craig tweets after she saw her son's Easter concert . The school, in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, insists this was not the reason, and that the change was merely a way of teaching children to read by adding different words. Adults who attended its Easter concert, however, were unconvinced. Andrea Craig, a councillor whose son sang in the show, tweeted: ‘At my son’s Easter concert I saw a song called Baa Baa Little Sheep which I assumed was new. Not so – not allowed black. Really?’ Councillor Andrea Craig Kingston upon Thames was surpised by the change of wording in Baa Baa Black Sheep . She said most parents in the audience were concerned about the change of wording. ‘It’s good they want children to think . about what different words mean. But this is one nursery rhyme I . personally don’t think should be used because it could be so easily . misconstrued as political correctness gone mad. They have got to be a . bit smarter about it.’ The school uses the phonic learning . system  to teach children aged three to seven word meanings through . well-known songs and rhymes. Its marketing manager Holly Christie said . Baa Baa Black Sheep had been changed ‘because it fitted in with the . theme of what we were doing. It was about baby sheep. ‘We have always had adjustments to Baa . Baa Black Sheep just because the children like to sing different . variations of that. It’s a way of teaching phonics so that children . understand these words that they are using and then reading.’ This is far from the first time the . rhyme has been amended. In 2006, children at two nurseries in . Oxfordshire were taught ‘Baa Baa Rainbow Sheep’ to promote ‘equal . opportunities’. Some children in London have been taught ‘Baa Baa Green . Sheep’. And in 1999, Birmingham City Council said the rhyme should not be taught at all because it was racially negative.","Pupils at Park Hill School sang Baa Baa Little Sheep instead of the traditional version at their Easter concert .

"When Cherie Higginson and her husband Mark from Wednesfield in the West Midlands decided to go on a joint diet last year not only did they lose pounds, they also managed to save a few too! In fact, the junk food fans shaved an incredible £5,000 off their household expenses in just 15 months by ditching the Chinese and Indian takeaways they had previously been enjoying three times a week. And as their food bills decreased so did their waistlines as the couple lost an incredible nine stone between them. Cherie and Mark, who hail from the West Midlands have lost a huge nine stone between them and saved £5,000 a year after cutting out takeaways . Cherie's has slimmed from 16st (left) to 11st 4lb (right) Cherie, 37, a clinical support worker for the NHS, explained that she and Mark had become stuck in a rut finding it simpler to binge on junk food after a long day at work than to cook a healthy meal. 'We were just being lazy. It was so much easier after a day at work to get a takeaway in rather than cook. It became a habit. 'We probably had a takeaway three times a week and then we ate out at the local pub once a week as well. That's £100 a week as a family.' Cherie, who has three children with Mark, Ewan, 14, Tia, 13 and Livvy, eight, decided to make a lasting change in the summer of 2013 when she found she barely recognised herself in her holiday photos. She said, 'I couldn't believe it was me. At first I thought it was someone else, but then I realised that this massive person was me.' Cherie and Mark, 40, then decided to ban convenience food from their family meals and replace it with healthy, cooked-from-fresh alternatives.

"It looked like a rare act of kindness in the midst of mindless violence. Dazed and bleeding, a young man sitting on the ground had been beaten senseless during a violent street attack in Hackney. Surrounded by a small crowd of curious onlookers, a ‘Good Samaritan’ gently helps the vulnerable and frightened young man to his feet. But within seconds looters decided this was a target too good to ignore. SCROLL DOWN TO SEE THE DISTURBING VIDEO .

"Geno Auriemma and Connecticut stand alone in women's college basketball, and they reached the top in unprecedented fashion. The Huskies routed Notre Dame 79-58 in the first championship game featuring undefeated teams, winning their record ninth national title. Auriemma broke a tie with Pat Summitt and Tennessee for most all-time, doing it in her backyard. Breanna Stewart, who was The Associated Press Player of the Year, scored 21 points to lead the Huskies (40-0) while Stefanie Dolson added 17 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists. Auriemma took out his senior center with a minute left and the game well in hand with the pair embracing in a long hug. Victorious: Connecticut center Stefanie Dolson (31) and team members celebrate with the championship trophy after the second half of the championship game against Notre Dame in the Final Four of the NCAA women's college basketball tournament, Tuesday, April 8, 2014, in Nashville, Tennessee . Triumph: Connecticut center Stefanie Dolson (31) and team members celebrate with the championship trophy after the second half of the championship game against Notre Dame in the Final Four of the NCAA women's college basketball tournament . 'We beat a great, great team,' Auriemma said. 'Notre Dame is a great team. For them to have the season they had and lose their starting center and to do what they did, I can't say enough about their players, coaching staff and it took everything we have. I knew if we played great we'd have a chance to win.' The victory also meant that UConn is now the center of the college basketball world with both the men's and women's teams winning the championship in the same year again. The men's team beat Kentucky in the title game Monday night. This pair of victories came a decade after the Huskies became the only school to accomplish the feat. 'I couldn't be prouder of what the men did last night,' Auriemma said. Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw congratulated the UConn coach when they shook hands after the game. 'I said something like, `I thought we were playing the Miami Heat for a while you guys are just that good.' What a great season, you know things like that,' McGraw said. 'I thought ... LeBron was the only thing they were missing.'

Huge: Connecticut and Notre Dame play during the first half of the championship game in the Final Four of the NCAA women's college basketball tournament on Tuesday . While the names change at UConn, from Rebecca Lobo to Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore and now Stewart, Auriemma has been the constant, winning nine titles in only 20 seasons - including the last two. He's never lost in a national championship game. 'Congratulations to the UConn Huskies for winning the 2014 NCAA National Championship!,' Summitt said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. 'My compliments also to coach Geno Auriemma for winning his ninth national title. He has accomplished this feat in record time.' It was the fifth unbeaten season for Auriemma and UConn and the first time the Huskies went 40-0 - matching Baylor as the only schools to accomplish that feat. The victory was also Connecticut's 46th straight dating back to last season's NCAA tournament title run. It's the third longest streak in school history - well short of the NCAA record 90 straight they won. The loss was Notre Dame's third in the title game in the past four years. Kayla McBride finished off her stellar career with 21 points to lead the Irish, who were looking for their first championship since 2001.

Tough battle: Connecticut forward Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis (23) and Notre Dame guard Kayla McBride (21) scramble for the ball during the first half of the championship game in the Final Four of the NCAA women's college basketball tournament . After proving to be no challenge for the Huskies during the first 15 years of the rivalry which began in 1995, Notre Dame had owned the series lately, winning seven of the previous nine meetings. UConn though has won the last two, eliminating Notre Dame in the Final Four last season before topping them in the championship game this year. The two former Big East rivals, who have no love lost for each other, put on a show in a game that women's basketball hoped could transcend the sport. The coaches added to the drama of the game with their verbal sparring on Monday. But it was Auriemma who got the last word again. Even with the loss, it was a spectacular season for the Irish. Notre Dame lost Skylar Diggins to graduation and changed conferences to the ACC. Neither mattered as they ran through their opponents, winning by an average of 25.6 points while taking both the conference regular season and tournament championships.

The Irish couldn't muster a similar effort against UConn and it's gigantic front line. Stewart, Dolson and Kiah Stokes dominated the interior. The Huskies outrebounded the Irish 54-31 and held them to a season-low in points. After the teams traded shots early on, Stewart - who earned outstanding player of the tournament honors for the second straight season - fueled a 16-0 run as the Huskies, who have played stellar defense all season, held the Irish without a point for nearly five minutes. Stewart's lay-in with 11:02 left made it 22-8. A minute later, Dolson had an acrobatic tip to Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis for another layup.

Hungry: UConn guard Shabazz Napier complained early in April that he often goes to bed hungry because he can't afford food. Days later, the NCAA announced a lifting of restrictions on free food provided to college athletes . The Irish stayed in the first half by hot 3-point shooting by Michaela Mabrey and Jewell Loyd. Trailing 37-25 with 4:09 left in the first half, the pair sparked a 13-6 run, hitting three 3-pointers which brought the Irish faithful to their feet. UConn led 45-38 at the half, shooting 57 percent from the field and having 16 assists on their 21 baskets. The Huskies closed the door on any Irish comeback scoring 18 of the first 22 points in the second half to put the game away. Stewart and Dolson had 10 points during the burst. 'I'm probably one of the luckiest people in the coaching profession because I get to coach players like Stefanie and Bria' Hartley, Auriemma said, fighting back tears. 'Yeah, I get to coach guys like that and that's why we can do what we do.' Dolson had promised President Barack Obama at the White House that the Huskies would be back, and UConn delivered.","UConn women's basketball team joined the men in victory at the NCAA Championships in Nashville, Tennessee on Tuesday ."
"A widow who faked her new husband's will to make her and her son sole beneficiaries of his £1million fortune is facing jail. Legal secretary Dawn Smith drew up the bogus document in her office two years before the death of her wealthy 61-year-old husband, Harvey. The 47-year-old cut her husband's two daughters out of the will and claimed that he wanted to leave his estate to her and her son from a previous relationship. Forgery: Dawn Smith, left, drew up the bogus document  two years before the death of her wealthy 61-year-old husband, Harvey (right) in 2012. She claimed that he wanted her and her son to be given his £1million fortune . She has since married again - to a waiter in the Turkish resort of Marmaris - and is now working as a bailiff for a debt company. Smith has left debts against her late husband's name by not settling the £3,600 bill for his funeral, police revealed. She also sold family heirlooms destined for Mr Smith's daughters to fund her trips to Turkey. It emerged she has visited Turkey almost once a month between the death of Mr Smith and her first court appearance in February. Smith has been ordered to hand in her passport by a judge as she awaits sentencing after admitting charges of forgery and making a false statement on oath. Mr Smith's daughter Karen, 43, said: 'I've not even grieved for his death yet as this has been so upsetting. 'It is hard not knowing what my dad's final wishes were. She took that away.' Moving on: Smith has since remarried to a Turkish waiter, pictured together, who works in the resort of Marmaris. She sold her late husband's family heirlooms in order to pay for trips to Turkey after his death . Harvey Smith, who owned an engineering firm, was given an MBE for services to industry in 1986. Smith faked the signatures of her husband, another legal secretary and a solicitor on the bogus document she drew up in 2010. After his death in November 2012, she told his family she didn't believe he had a last will and testament. But she later produced the paperwork - back-dated to February 2011 - which left their £500,000 house in Darlington and £420,000 pension to her. It excluded Karen and included explicit instructions that her sister Zoe, 25, should not receive anything at all. Her deception was uncovered when a partner at the Darlington law firm of Hewitts, where Smith had worked, thought it suspicious the women were overlooked while Dawn Smith's son was included. The lawyer - a personal friend of Mr Smith - raised concerns and staff spotted basic errors. One of the supposed witnesses had left the firm at the time they were said to have signed it, and the other had changed offices. Police were alerted and a handwriting expert concluded that Mr Smith's signature was not the same as legitimate ones provided by detectives. At Teesside Crown Court, Smith, 47, was also ordered to report to police twice a week until she is sentenced early next month. The case was adjourned for pre-sentence reports. Her barrister, Caroline Goodwin, said Smith wanted to travel to Turkey to 'settle her affairs' before the likely prison term. But Judge John Walford said: 'My immediate reaction to that proposal would be unfavourable. Restrictions should be placed on her movements.' And he warned Smith: 'You should not be misled into thinking my adjourning for a report and granting you bail doesn't mean that prison is likely.' Smith wed her wealthy husband three years before his death and moved into his detached three-storey home in Darlington, in 2006. Detective Constable Mick Trodden, who investigated the case, described Smith's crimes as 'cynical and calculating'. Brenda Davidson, managing partner of Hewitts Solicitors, said: 'The actions of Dawn Smith were outside the course of her employment and came to light many months after she had left the firm. 'As soon as we became aware of the situation we notified the police and co-operated fully in the investigation.'","Dawn Smith forged her husband Harvey's will two years before his death .

"He is trained to detect heroin, cocaine and marijuana. But convicts in Vacaville Prison learned the hard way that Drako, a Belgian Melanois, has a keen sense for something slightly unexpected: cell phones. Whether it is dismantled, fully intact, or submerged in peanut butter, the six-year-old canine seems to land on the device every time. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Star sniffer: Drako, a Belgian Melanois, has detected more than 1,000 phones in four years at Vacaville, CA . He once found 30 phones hidden in a microwave. Wardens at the all-male prison have no idea what it is that the once-abandoned sniffer dog smells in cell phones. Officer Brian Pyle, who has worked with Drako for almost five years, told KPIX5: 'He'll alert on a cellphone, he'll alert on a Bluetooth, he's alerted on a laptop with a wireless card installed in it. 'What the actual chemical of it is, we don't know. 'There's a lot of different theories...I know it's not just the battery and I know it's not just the phone. He can find a battery and he can find a phone. 'Anything that's ever been attached to a cellphone, he can find it.' Top dog: The six-year-old canine was abandoned by his first trainer before officer Brian Pyle found him . Got it: Here he can be seen lunging for a pot of peanut butter hidden in a prison cell containing a phone . Federal law enforcement directors have branded cell phones one of the most serious contraband items behind bars in the country. In 2011, a Mississippi prisoner was found to be running an identity theft program from his cell over the phone, and last year two murderers plotted their escape from a Florida prison via text. There are just 30 U.S. dogs that are capable of sniffing out the devices. Not fooled: He once found 30 cell phones hidden inside a microwave, which normally throws detectors off . Couldn't do without him: Cell phones are one of the most serious problems in California prisons . And Drako is thought to be one of the most successful since wardens started trialing the method. He was snapped up by California's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation at the age of two after another training camp decided he wasn't good enough. Abandoned and rapidly losing weight, he was given a lifeline when Officer Pyle took him in.","Drako, a Belgian Melanois, sniffs phones even when they are dismantled .

Wilson-Britten, 22, a teacher at a former Kids R Kids location in Riverdale, Georgia, was arrested on Friday after the surveillance footage surfaced. The clip, which has now been made public, shows her apparently pushing pupil Jayden Reece away with her foot as he approaches her with a toy  in his hands. Scroll down for video . Captured on camera: A childcare worker is facing a battery charge after being caught on CCTV allegedly kicking a 20-month-old boy in the face . Wrong move: Alexis J. Wilson-Britten, 22, a teacher at a former Kids R Kids day care center in Riverdale, Georgia, was arrested on Friday after the surveillance footage surfaced . Dismissed: The clip, which has now been made public, shows her apparently pushing pupil Jayden Reece away with her foot as he approaches her with a toy held in his hands . He appears to hold the object up to protect himself from the blow. Jayden is the son of fellow day care worker and teacher, Kimberly Johnson. She told CBS46 that she became concerned about the care being provided at the center after her other son, Ayden - Jayden's twin brother - came home from  on Thursday with a fractured arm. Ayden apparently injured himself in the playground but Wilson-Britten had not reported it to administrators. After Johnson informed the daycare center manager of  the teacher’s 'poor performance' her actions were reviewed. It was then that the 'kicking' incident came to light on surveillance video. Clayton County Georgia Police spokeswoman JaQuitta Williams told WSB-TV that Wilson-Britten performed the same action 'not once, but twice' although the released footage does not show the second strike. Facing charges: Wilson-Britten, who does not have a prior criminal record, was arrested Friday evening and later released Saturday . Robert Phelps, the owner of the daycare center, said Wilson-Britten was going to be fired the day she allegedly kicked Jayden. Her dismissal was linked to a prior case when she allegedly taped a pacifier to another toddler's mouth to stop her from crying. Police said Jayden wasn't injured in the incident, but they are investigating the injury to Ayden. Wilson-Britten, who does not have a prior criminal record, was arrested Friday evening and later released Saturday. The incident remains under investigation. A spokesperson who has rights to the Kids R Kids franchise said it terminated its agreement with the location in Riverdale more than a year ago and is not associated with the chain.","Alexis J.

"Low-calorie artificial sweeteners found in diet drinks actually 'raise the risk of diabetes and obesity' Millions rely on them to help them stay thin. But low-calorie artificial sweeteners actually raise the risk of obesity, researchers fear. The popular sugar alternatives found in diet drinks and in sachets in cafes and restaurants may also increase the odds of diabetes. The sweeteners under the microscope are saccharin, which is found in Sweet’N Low, sucralose, which is found in Splenda, and aspartame, which is found in many diet drinks. The Israeli researchers that ‘today’s massive, unsupervised consumption’ of artificial sweeteners needs to be reassessed. The warning at a time when growing concern about the damage done by sugar is likely to mean more people are switching to artificial alternatives. British experts urged caution, saying that much of the work was done in mice. But they also said that water is the healthiest drink. The researchers, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, first showed that all three sweeteners made it more difficult for mice to process sugar. This is known as glucose intolerance and is important because it raises risk of developing diabetes and obesity. In a study of almost 400 people, the researchers linked artificial sweetener with being fatter and glucose intolerance. And, worryingly, volunteers who didn’t normally eat or drink artificially-sweetened foods began to become glucose intolerant after just four days of consumption. The numbers affected were small – just four out of seven men and women in the trial – but the research overall was judged significant enough to be published in Nature one of the world’s most prestigious scientific journals. Other experiments suggested the sweeteners do the damage by altering type of bacteria in the gut. While this might seem odd, some of the bugs that live naturally in our digestive system are very good at breaking down food. If they thrive on artificial sweeteners, this could lead to more energy being extracted from food and more fat being stored – raising the odds of obesity. Lead researcher Professor Eran Elinav, said: ‘Our relationship with our own individual mix of gut bacteria is a huge factor in determining how the food we eat affects us. ‘Especially intriguing is the link between use of artificial sweeteners - through the bacteria in our guts - to a tendency to develop the very disorders they were designed to prevent. ‘This calls for reassessment of today's massive, unsupervised consumption of these substances.’ The professor has stopped using artificial sweeteners. He has also removed sugar from his diet – but says it is too early to make health recommendations based on his study. Dr Katarina Kos, a diabetes expert from the University of Exeter, said that larger-scale human studies are ‘urgently required’. She added: ‘Meanwhile, these findings support the widespread understanding that water is the healthiest drink option and that we should avoid sweet and sweetened drinks. ‘Water is the best drink to control our blood sugar.’ Others urged caution – and pointed out that most of the work was done on mice. The sweeteners under the microscope are saccharin, which is found in Sweet’N Low, sucralose, which is found in Splenda, and aspartame, which is found in many diet drinks. But the British Soft Drinks Association said research contradicts ‘the overwhelming body of scientific evidence’ Catherine Collins, chief dietician at St George’s Hospital in London, said: ‘If you are a human trying to lose weight, you need to lose calories from your diet. ‘Low-calorie sweeteners help you reduce your calorie intake and it’s a good lifestyle move for those wanting to lose weight.’ Brian Ratcliffe, professor of nutrition at Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, said that most of the experiments related to saccharin – which is rarely found in diet fizzy drinks. He said: ‘There seems no reason to suggest that swopping to a diet version of your favourite fizzy drink is unwise.’ Gavin Partington, of the British Soft Drinks Association, said research contradicts ‘the overwhelming body of scientific evidence’. He said: ‘More than 40 studies have concluded that the use of low-calorie sweeteners do not lead to either an increased risk of obesity or diabetes. ‘Decades of clinical research show that low-calorie sweeteners, such as those in diet drinks, have been found to aid weight control when part of an overall healthy diet and assist with diabetes management.’ The International Sweeteners Association, which represents manufacturers including the maker of Splenda, also strongly rejected the research.","Sweeteners under fire include aspartame - found in many diet drinks .

"JERRY LEE LEWIS: HIS OWN STORY by Rick Bragg (Canongate £20) John Lennon kissed his feet and told him he’d been his formative influence. Tom Jones felt the same. Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones was — is — devoted to him. And now, Jerry Lee Lewis has told his own remarkable story — possibly in the nick of time. Rock ’n’ roll’s original wild man, its most improbable survivor, is photographed in this absorbing biography with the latest of his seven wives, and looks as inert and dead-eyed as a waxwork. Yet he made a Top 30 album as recently as 2008 and in his 80th year he still occasionally performs live, pulling in an adoring crowd. The man they still call ‘Killer’ continues to hammer those ivories like he always did, only now he hammers them with his walking-stick, a showman to the end. Wild man of rock ’n’ roll: Lewis in his heyday. He made a Top 30 album as recently as 2008 and in his 80th year he still occasionally performs live, pulling in an adoring crowd . When the end does come, the surprise will be that it didn’t arrive sooner. Lewis has outlived two of his wives (the fourth and fifth of whom died in mysterious circumstances) and even two of his children, but he hasn’t exactly looked after himself. Nor, for that matter, has he looked after his reputation. The man who so inspired Lennon, Jones, Richards and many others has a seriously long rap sheet; his many crimes include car theft, bigamy and assault. He acquired the nickname ‘Killer’ while still at school, for half-strangling a teacher. His first cousin, TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, no angel himself, has built quite a sideline out of praying for Jerry Lee’s soul. It was a lost cause, that soul, long before the night in November 1976 when, dead drunk, Lewis rammed the gates of Elvis Presley’s Graceland mansion with his Lincoln Continental. When the Memphis police arrived to arrest him, they found that he had a loaded gun in the car. Lewis rammed the gates of Elvis Presley’s Graceland mansion with his Lincoln Continental . To this day, Graceland tour guides tell the story, and while Lewis hotly denies to his biographer Rick Bragg that his intention that winter’s night was to shoot his old buddy Elvis, fact and fiction are as intertwined in this book as, well, rock and roll. So who knows? Bragg, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, concedes at the outset that over the two summers he spent listening to Lewis reminiscing, the old rascal remembered his life ‘as it pleased him’. So this is very far from a definitive chronicle. But it is still a thumpingly good yarn about a man whose amazing stagecraft once left even the similarly flamboyant Chuck Berry lost for words. In March 1958, while touring with Berry and Buddy Holly, Lewis grudgingly agreed to Berry topping the bill . In March 1958, while touring with Berry and Buddy Holly, Lewis grudgingly agreed to Berry topping the bill. But he never made it easy for other performers to follow him onstage — Johnny Cash did it once, and refused ever to countenance the idea again — and one night in Brooklyn, Lewis made it impossible. With Berry waiting in the wings, Lewis poured petrol over his piano, set it alight, and played Great Balls Of Fire as it burned. Some who were there attest that when eventually he swaggered off stage, with the audience exultant, flames still leaping from the piano and fire trucks on their way, he said to Berry, ‘Follow that, n*****!’ To Bragg, he vehemently denies using the N-word. Again, who knows? Either way, it is hard to think of any musician of any era with a story as colourful as this, or with such a talent for finding trouble. But for all his crimes, all the drink, drugs, hot-headedness, the jaw-dropping extravagance, there was really only one scandal that Lewis has never shrugged off. It erupted in Britain, in that same eventful year of 1958, when reporters here learnt that he had recently married — bigamously, to boot — his 13-year-old third cousin, Myra Gale Brown. The matter was even raised in Parliament, and he was booed at his concerts, and called ‘cradle robber’. This is where Bragg’s journalistic antennae go haywire, so in thrall is he to Lewis’s side of the story. Myra is presented as a seductive Lolita, with 22-year-old Jerry Lee powerless to resist. ‘She was slim,’ writes Bragg, ‘with wavy brown hair and a swan’s neck and big, big eyes, and if she was a child, he was a Russian monkey cosmonaut.’ The British Press, meanwhile, come across as moralistic prudes. In an otherwise thrillingly readable book, it’s a rather revolting exercise in justification. Still, it’s true that back in rural Louisiana, where Lewis came from, making a bride of your 13-year-old cousin seemed like no big deal. Lewis' relationship with Presley was sullied and so his relationship with Priscilla Beaulieu, which began when she was only 14, went uncensured . He still can’t understand the brouhaha it caused, and remains deeply resentful that it so sullied his reputation when Elvis’s relationship with Priscilla Beaulieu, which began when she was only 14, went uncensured. Bragg tries hard, without ever quite succeeding, to get to the bottom of Lewis’s complex relationship with Presley, whom for several years he rivalled as rock ’n’ roll’s hottest property. They were close enough to spend one wild night riding their Harley-Davidson motorbikes round Memphis, both stark naked, according to a story that Lewis, this time, does not deny. Just like Elvis, Lewis was born into Deep South poverty in 1935, the height of the Great Depression . But each was thoroughly chippy about the other, and time hasn’t diminished Lewis’s chippiness. Elvis couldn’t really act, he tells Bragg, and Johnny Cash couldn’t really sing. Just like Elvis, Lewis was born into Deep South poverty in 1935, the height of the Great Depression. Also like Elvis, he had a father who served time in prison. But Elmo Kidd Lewis did one great thing in his life, mortgaging his small farm to buy the child prodigy a piano. Before he became a star, Jerry Lee even trained to be a preacher, like cousin Jimmy. His tortured Christian faith is another recurrent theme of his life. But pretty much everyone who heard him play the piano knew that’s where his destiny lay. His big break arrived when he was 21, when record producer Sam Phillips got him a gig on primetime TV, and he played Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On live on The Steve Allen Show. He was a sensation. Overnight his earning power leapt from $100 a show to $10,000, and when he and Myra later had a son, they called him Steve Allen Lewis. But in 1962, aged three, the boy drowned in a swimming pool at their half-constructed home. Jerry Lee was away on tour when it happened. Myra, still only 17, was indoors, cooking spaghetti. Popular music has a tendency to amplify the triumphs and tragedies of its greatest performers, but still it is hard to think of anyone who has ridden life’s rollercoaster quite like Jerry Lee Lewis. His rock ’n’ roll career never entirely recovered from the Myra scandal, but in the late Sixties, around the time his marriage to Myra was falling apart, country music embraced him and made him a superstar all over again. Then, no sooner had he rescaled the mountain, than he went and lost another son, Jerry Lee Jnr, who died, aged 19, in a jeep the old man had bought him. Even if Lewis had never played the villainous Iago alongside Sammy Davis Jnr and Zsa Zsa Gabor in a 1968 stage production of Othello — which gives Bragg yet another extraordinary episode to write about — this would still be a tale of Shakespearean dimensions.","Just like Elvis, Lewis was born into Deep South poverty in 1935 .

"Scientists are struggling to understand the cause of a 'sleeping epidemic' among the few remaining residents of a Russian Soviet-era 'ghost town' and a nearby village in Kazakhstan. Dozens of locals in Krasnogorsk, Russia, and Kalachi, Kazakhstan, have been hit by the mystery condition which causes them to doze off for up to six days. There are even fears one sufferer - an elderly man - was buried alive before the epidemic was diagnosed. This is one of the victims of the 'sleeping epidemic' that routinely hits areas near a disused Soviet mine . An abandoned uranium mine in Krasnogorsk and the village of Kalachi is thought to be drugging residents . The illness has come in a number of waves, for example May 2013, New Year 2014, and this month. Some residents even keep bags packed in case they need to be whisked to hospital. It is believed to be caused by a disused uranium mine nearby - but experts cannot find evidence to make the connection. Almost . 7,000 experiments have been conducted into the mystery slumbers, with . everything tested from local vodka to radiation, and including analyses . of soil, water, air, blood, hair, and nails.

Mystery: Dozens of locals doze off for up to six days, but scientists' tests have proved inconclusive . People, including this 75-year-old from Kalachi, Kazakhstan, pack hospital bags in case they are struck down . 'I was milking cows, as usual, early in the morning, and fell asleep,' Marina Felk, 50, a milkmaid in Kalachi, told The Siberian Times. 'I remember nothing at all, only that when I came round I was in a hospital ward, and the nurses smiled and me, and said: ""Welcome back sleeping princess, you've finally woken up"". 'What else do I remember? Nothing. I slept for two days and two nights. Krasnogorsk, which was once home to 6,500 people, has now become a ghost town and the remaining residents are struggling to make ends meet . A woman picks up logs in the quiet village of Krasnogorsk.

Radon gas is seen as a possible cause, but he is sceptical. 'I am an anaesthesiologist myself and we use similar gases for anaesthesia but the patients wake up a maximum in one hour after surgery,' he said.

"A couple who renewed their vows to celebrate their 25th anniversary saw their celebrations come to an abrupt end after it was gatecrashed by up to 40 men and the wife ended up thrown on the floor. Tracie Cowan, 50, spent two years planning and saving up in secret to celebrate her wedding anniversary with husband Jimmy by renewing their vows at St Mary's Church in Tenby, Wales, where they had married in 1989. But the celebrations afterwards at the ex-Serviceman's Club turned were ruined when a group of drunken men, who had earlier been exposing themselves in the street, tried to force their way in. Mr Cowan, 53, described the group as a violent 'pack of animals' and said he feared if they had managed to get into the reception elderly people and children could have been hurt. His wife was thrown to the floor in her wedding dress as she attempted to stop the men. Scroll down for video . Jimmy and Tracey Cowan renewed their vows at a church in Tenby to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary but the celebrations were later ruined by a group of drunken men who tried to gatecrash the party . 'I had just walked my father to the car and had two of my grandchildren with me when this group of men were outside with their trousers round their ankles. They were exposing themselves and being disgusting in front of the children so I asked them to stop,' said Mrs Cowan. 'The next thing I knew I was thrown to the ground.' Mr Cowan said his grandchildren, aged between five and 13, had alerted him to what was happening outside after they saw the men out of a window. 'There were four or five of them with their trousers and pants down waving their private parts, and one with just his socks on,' said the 53-year-old. 'I went outside and could not believe my wife had been flung to the ground in her white wedding dress. She had asked the men to behave themselves.' Mr Cowan had gone outside to get reception on his mobile phone to call police but by the time he returned around 40 drunken men had appeared and were trying to force their way up the stairs. Police had to be called after around 40 drunken brawlers tried to gatecrash and threw Mrs Cowan to the floor . The couple married 25 years ago and decided to renew their vows at the same place as their wedding in 1989 . Guests tried to stop them, one suffering broken fingers and another having his glasses smashed. Mr Cowan added: 'We had children at the function, along with some elderly guests and many were really scared by what was happening. These men were so violent it was unbelievable. They were like a pack of animals. It was like a full-blown riot. 'Because they couldn't get in one of the men pushed my wife over. 'A few people were injured. A friend of mine got a couple of broken fingers while another friend was injured on his elbow and had his glasses smashed. 'Another had a black eye. A few women who had been outside smoking at the time also were injured when they got caught up in it. 'It was disgusting. 'If they had got in more people would have been hurt. The main concern was to keep these blokes downstairs. There were children and people in their seventies upstairs. There was also lots of glass. If they had got in they would have wrecked the place.' Mr Cowan called police on the non-emergency 101 service but after police took 20 minutes to arrive he said he wished he had used 999. Mr Cowan said doormen from three other pubs in the town, who had heard about the trouble, arrived to help them. The couple, who have been married 25 years, wanted to celebrate with a service similar to their wedding . He added: 'We really want to thank the people from Tenby, who heard about what was happening, and came up from the town and kept these blokes out of our venue.' Mr Cowan said the brawl did ruin the celebrations as most guests started to leave after the incident. He had not known about the event until he walked into the church as his wife had spent two years planning it in secret - inviting family he had not seen in years, including his 18 month old granddaughter that he had never met. Mr Cowan added: 'It was all a complete surprise for me. 'Tracie had been planning it for two years, putting a bit of money away now and again. 'She got my two sons down from Scotland and my grandchildren to come. 'I didn't know anything about it until I walked into the church. My friend has just had a son and had asked me to be a godparent so I thought that's why I was going to the church. 'It was a bit emotional.' Mr Cowan said he was very angry that police had not done anything to prevent the incident as he had heard at 4.30pm that day that a group of men were causing trouble. He added: 'These men were already playing up, behaving appallingly, hours before and yet they were allowed to stay in Tenby getting more and more rowdy. 'They were turned away from loads of pubs. Why the hell did the police allow them to keep drinking for three or four hours more? They should have got them out of Tenby and then this would never have happened. 'I am totally disappointed in the police. They won't tell us where those men were from, and they did not even go into the club to take statements. Their only concern was getting them on the bus out of Tenby.' After the service on November 9, Mrs Cowan posted on Facebook: 'Tracie Cowan and Jimmy Cowan qould like to say a huge thank you to everyone that made our day so special yesterday it was the best day ever , thank you to . for the fantastic venue , thank you to tosh,Chris and staff at the exservicemen's club . Thank you to the doormen from the bush and Tenby house for helping out with the thugs that tried to get in.' Temporary Chief Inspector Ross Evans said 'officers were at the scene within a couple of minutes of getting reports' and the incident was dealt with 'swiftly' and 'robustly'. He added: 'The priority was to ensure matters did not escalate, which is why a large group of visiting men were placed on a bus and removed. 'But details of all those involved were taken, and although no complaints of assault  were received at the time, inquires will continue to establish whether any offences took place.'","Jimmy and Tracie Cowan renewed their vows to celebrate 25th anniversary .

"A toddler in China has been killed and partially eaten by a pig after crawling into the animal's pen while his parents' backs were turned. Two-year-old Wei Tsao, known affectionately as Keke, had been playing in the garden of his parents' house, in eastern China's Jiangsu Province, when they went inside for a moment. Left to his own devices Wei crawled into the pig pen where the protective sow mauled him to death in an attempt to protect her newborn piglets, before she began chewing on his head. Two-year-old Wei Tsao was mauled to death after crawling into the pen of this female pig in China as she attempted to protect her newborn piglets . Hearing their child's screams, the parents rushed back outside but found they were too late. Distraught father Sun Tsai, 25, said: 'We had popped inside for just a couple of minutes when we heard the screams. 'When we came out we saw the pig about 80 metres away gnawing on Keke's head.' Other villagers came rushing to the scene where they grabbed the pig and tied it to a tree before killing it and cutting its stomach open. Inside they found fragments of Keke's skull and hair, which they showed to authorities to prove the pig had killed him. Wei had been playing in the garden with his parents when they went inside for a moment. When they heard the boy's screams they came back outside, only to find the pig eating his head . Village leader Cheng Yuan, 62, said: 'This is a horrible tragedy. We had to cut the pig open, not as an act of revenge but to prove to the authorities that it had indeed killed and eaten Keke.' A police spokesman said: 'Sows are often docile creatures but pregnant pigs and ones who have just given birth can be very protective and turn aggressive towards anything they consider to be a threat to their piglets. 'We urge farmers to keep their pigs in their pens.'","Wei Tsao, 2, was left playing in garden while parents went inside house .

"Mysterious rocks that shine and emit a strange vapour have been discovered in Mexico. The rock fragments, which were found in the state of Sonora, emit vapours that are said to have a chlorine-like odour. The emanating gas has also been reported to produce a colour change in materials including paper and cardboard. Brazil Weird News has reported the discovery of unusual shining vapourous rocks  in Mexico. The rocks, which were found in the state of Sonora, emit vapours that are said to have a chlorine odour . A metallurgical laboratory in Copper del Mayo, Mexico, is currently testing samples of the material. ‘We don't know what these rocks are but mining companies operating in the region are interested in analysing them in their laboratories,’ said technical secretary of Novojoa's Civil Defence, Juan Manuel Ramirez Sandoval, according to the Brazil Weird News report. According to the commander of the region’s Fire Department, the public are concerned about the damaging effects that these rocks may pose. The vapours have also been reported to produce a colour change in materials including paper and cardboard. A metallurgical laboratory in Copper del Mayo, Mexico, is currently testing samples of the material . ‘We do not know where they came from these stones,’ he told Brazil Weird News. ‘They can have fallen from some truck, perhaps. We also don't know if the gas is something like a toxic substance or if the stones are radioactive. ‘Only a careful study can determine their origin, if these rocks are of the Earth... or not.’ Last year, an unamed woman had to undergo surgery on her leg after rocks spontaneously combusted in her pocket. The 43-year-old woman had enjoyed a day with her family at Trestles Beach, San Diego. During the visit, her children had collected seven unusual-looking rocks - orange and green in colour - and the woman had put them in the right pocket of her cargo shorts to carry home. Captain Marc Stone, a spokesman for Orange County Fire Authority, explained that the woman began to feel intense heat emanating from her pocket as she was standing in the kitchen of her San Clemente home. Her clothing and skin began to burn as the heat intensified, and she also suffered second-degree burns to her hand as she tried to remove the rocks from her pocket. It has been suggested that the rocks contained phosphorite. A chemical chain reaction could have ignited them as they were been subjected to friction in the woman's pocket as she walked. Phosphorus in rocks, or phosphorite, is . usually deposited by sediment - dissolved phosphorus from continental . weathering that is brought to the oceans by rivers and streams.","The rocks, which were found in the state of Sonora, have a chlorine odour .

"Professor Bruce Keogh who has urged the public to go to pharmacies if they are unwell rather than A&E or their GP surgeries . Patients are being urged to stay away from hospital casualty units this winter over concerns that they are already under ‘unprecedented’ strain. The NHS’s medical director, Professor Bruce Keogh, yesterday urged the public to go to pharmacies if unwell rather than A&E or GP surgeries. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also announced that an extra £300million had been freed up to help struggling hospitals pay for extra beds and staff over the coming months. Some 28,000 extra patients a week are arriving in A&E units compared with this time last year, with the result that many hospitals are already overcrowded. The situation is expected to worsen in the coming weeks as patients succumb to chest infections and wards are shut due to the winter vomiting bug. Professor Keogh said a lot of the strain on A&E departments and GP surgeries could be relieved if people used pharmacies more. ‘Many of these have private consultation rooms where you can get quite good advice and you don’t have to wait in a pharmacy,’ he added. ‘You can generally see someone in a matter of minutes. They can either recommend off-the-shelf treatment or, if appropriate, send you to your GP or to attend A&E.’ Mr Hunt issued a warning that the pressures on A&E were unsustainable. ‘Are things going to go on like this? Are we going to have to keep putting more and more sums into the NHS?’ he said. ‘The answer is it is not sustainable in the long run to say all the extra pressure in the NHS has to be borne by the A&E department.’ The ‘bed occupancy rate’ of hospitals is running at 88 per cent, compared with the 85 per cent considered safe. Some, including Birmingham Children’s Hospitals, are above 95 per cent. If hospitals are too overcrowded there is a greater risk of infection. The situation in hospitals and GP surgeries is expected to worsen in the coming weeks as patients succumb to chest infections (file pic) David Flory, chief executive of the NHS Trust Development Authority, which supports hospitals, said many were significantly more crowded than this time last year. He said higher numbers of older patients were coming into hospital with a range of ‘complicated conditions’ and having to stay longer. It is estimated the extra funding announced by Mr Hunt can pay for the equivalent of 1,000 extra doctors, 2,000 nurses and 2,500 beds. Hospitals will also hire agency staff as well as paying overtime to staff. They will also reopen wards and departments which had been closed. But doctors’ leader Mark Porter, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘While extra funding is desperately needed, this announcement is merely a sticking plaster. Many hospitals are already at, and in places over, capacity.’ He warned that the NHS ‘needs a long-term plan rather than a short-term fix’. Some 28,000 extra patients a week are arriving in A&E units compared with this time last year (file picture) The NHS has missed its target that 95 per cent of A&E patients are treated within four hours every week for the past year. Last week 417,000 patients arrived in A&E, compared with 389,000 the same week last year. Some 104,000 had to be admitted, up from 98,700 last year. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘Throwing money at it when winter’s about to start is not good enough. ‘England’s A&Es are getting worse, not better, and this panic move is too little to stop the NHS facing a difficult winter. It is further evidence David Cameron can’t be trusted with it.’","Professor Bruce Keogh has urged people to go to pharmacies if unwell .

"A man who turned his antebellum Mississippi home into a quirky Elvis Presley shrine was found dead Thursday on the front porch, two days after police said he killed a man who broke into the museum. Paul MacLeod, 71, was spotted slumped in a chair outside the cluttered museum known as Graceland Too, said Marshall County Coroner James Richard Anderson. The man’s body showed no signs of trauma. ‘It appears to be natural causes but it is pending until we get the autopsy,’ Anderson said. Biggest fan: Paul MacLeod, 71, a lifelong Elvis fanatic, was found dead in his Mississippi home doubling as a museum dedicated to the legendary singer two days after he shot dead an intruder . All shook up: MacLeod's lawyer has suggested that the stress caused by deadly confrontation Tuesday may have played a role in the death of the elderly man . Bloodshed: MacLeod, pictured in 2009, fatally shot Dwight Taylor, 28, once in the chest after the man forced his way into the museum and demanded money . Phillip Knecht, Paul McLeod's attorney, speaks outside Graceland Too in Holly Springs, Miss, Thursday, which has been closed to visitors since Tuesday night . MacLeod's death comes two days after police say he killed Dwight Taylor, 28, at the 1850s home that doubled as a makeshift exhibition space. The homeowner was questioned by police, but no charges were filed. MacLeod attorney Phillip Knecht said Taylor forced his way inside, demanded money, and the two men fought before the shooting. According to MacLeod's attorney, the 71-year-old museum owner heard someone banging on the front door at around 11pm Tuesday. When he went to answer, the stranger forced his way inside and demanded cash, The Daily Journal reported. McLeod tried to shut the door, but the suspect, Dwight Taylor, stuck his foot inside the house. That is when police say the septuagenarian pulled out his gun and fired a single .45 caliber bullet to Taylor's chest, killing him. Long live the King: MacLeod built a shrine to his idol and spent decades collecting memorabilia associated with Presley's life and career . Heartbreak hotel: MacLeod said in a 2009 interview that at one point he had to choose between his marriage and his growing collection - and he chose Elvis . What a character: With his silver hair worn in 1950s slicked-back do, MacLeod has been a well-known persona in the Jackson area, his makeshift museum drawing visitors from around the world . The museum is located in Holly Springs, in the kudzu-covered hills of north Mississippi -about halfway between Presley's birthplace in Tupelo and his final home and resting place at the Graceland mansion in Memphis, Tennessee. Graceland Too - which is not affiliated with Graceland or the Presley estate - became a pilgrimage for superfans. Visitors could arrive at any hour of the day or night, pay $5 and get a tour from the hyper-caffeinated MacLeod, who said in 2009 that he drank 24 cans of Coca-Cola a day. Wearing his thinning silver hair in a perpetual 1950s slicked-back do, he would tap on visitors' arms as he pointed out items in his floor-to-ceiling hodgepodge of photos, records, knickknacks, cardboard cutouts, clocks and other random kitsch featuring Elvis. ‘My ex-wife told me, “Make up your mind. Either me or the Elvis collection.” So that put an end to that,' MacLeod, who named his son after the King of Rock `n' Roll, told The . Associated Press in late 2009. Local institution: Visiting Graceland Too was a rite of passage for students from the University of Mississippi . Health concerns: MacLeod once boasted that he drank 24 cans of Coca Cola a day; he is survived by his son . Mr MacLeod owned his home since the 1970s and said he started opening it to tourists in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Graceland Too attracted international tourists, and visiting there was a rite of passage for students from the University of Mississippi. Willie Carter, of McComb, said Thursday he toured Graceland Too five times while he was a student at Ole Miss. Like many others, he'd go with a group of friends around 2am. ‘It was extremely weird,’ Carter said. ‘You just went with it. He seemed to have a real love for Elvis and all things Elvis. You could tell he was sincere.’ Floors would creak beneath visitors' feet. Doorways were decorated with several Elvis-patterned curtains in `70s-era hues of turquoise and lime. There were stacks of papers and magazines and .

"An 800 pound body caused a crematorium in Richmond, Virginia, to catch fire on Wednesday afternoon after the smokestack overheated setting the roof ablaze. The fire at Southside Cremation Services started just after noon as workers had started to cremate the over-sized corpse. According to manager Jerry Hendrix Sr., the large amount of fat on the body created excessive heat and oil once the cremation process had started. An 800 pound body caused the roof at Southside Cremation Services in Richmond, Virginia, to catch fire on Wednesday afternoon after the smokestack overheated . Neighbors could see the smoke billowing from the smokestack around noon. 'The body was so obese that the actual body fat came off and went straight up the sack and hit the roof material, the rubber roof we have up there and that's what made it go up like it did…It was no negligence involved in it,’ he told NBC12. Richmond and Henrico County fire crews were called and the blaze was under control with half an hour, according to the Henrico County Division of Fire. ‘My guys, we did all we could. Once it started, the grease hit the roof and started the fire, the only thing we could do is dial 911 and get the fire department here,’ Hendrix said. Richmond and Henrico County fire crews were called and the blaze was under control with half an hour, according to the Henrico County Division of Fire . Three people were inside of the plant at the time of the fire. All were able to get out unharmed. There were also three bodies on site at the time of the fire, but the manager says none were damaged in the process. Later on Wednesday afternoon the crematorium received the go-ahead to resume cremating the body. The family was not present during the cremation, Hendrix said. The business will be closed for a few days to repair damage to the roof and furnace. He said the facility is known across Virginia for handling large people.

"Most landlords prepare themselves for some less-than-appealing personal remnants when a tenant leaves, so when this man found more than £600,000 hidden under a bed, it was this shock of his life. Ma Guangdi was cleaning up after one of his former tenants in an apartment in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China when he made the surprising discovery. Underneath one of the beds, he found 6.33million Chinese Yuan in cash, stacked in carton boxes and left behind.

High numbers: The fortune has now been placed in a safety bank account and remains frozen while police investigate the former tenant . ‘When we moved away the bed mattress, we saw that there were four carton boxes under the bed. Each box was fully stuffed and sealed up.’ When Mr Ma tore one corner of the box he was shocked to find that it was filled with bundles of cash. Mr Ma called police who took the money away to be counted, with the local bank valuing the cash to 6.33million Yuan (£616,000) The fortune has now been placed in a safety bank account and remains frozen while police investigate the former tenant.","Chinese man finds £616,000 hidden under former tenant's bed .

"Drivers on this newly-built highway found themselves on a road to nowhere when they hit an entire farm blocking the route. Most of the residents of Dongying, China, accepted pay packages to move out and allow for construction on the road. But farmer Ye Tan, 72, and his wife Shen, 71, felt they were not offered enough - so stayed put. Scroll down for video .

Small vehicles can make their way round on a narrow dirt track to the side. Lorries, however, will have to turn back and take a diversion. Motorists have blasted the construction workers for failing to notify anyone about the obstacle, which does not show up on sat navs. Stubborn: Farmer Ye Tan refused to sell up and move on so construction workers simply built either side of him .

Lian He, 35, told local media: 'I couldn't believe it when I was travelling down the road and it just ended at the farm. 'On both sides there is a massive construction site and the only way to get past was to use a dirt path which I doubt would be wide enough for a lorry and certainly not for two cars. 'My navigation system told me it was the best short cut but clearly nobody had told the people that programmed it about the farmhouse.'

"A man who was convicted of smuggling heroin in his intestines has become the seventh Pakistani beheaded for drug trafficking in Saudi Arabia in a month. Niaz Mohammad Ghulam Mohammad was executed in Kharj Governorate in the Riyadh Region because he tried to smuggle 'a large quantity of heroin inside his intestines into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia', the Ministry of Interior stated. His death brings the number of foreigners and Saudis executed by the Kingdom for crimes this year to 67, despite concerns expressed by the international community. This is compared to 69 for the whole of last year, according to Human Rights Watch. The man was executed in Kharj Governorate in the Riyadh Region because he tried to smuggle 'a large quantity of heroin inside his intestines into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia' (file picture) The fact that the heroin was found within the man's intestines suggests he would have ingested the drugs by swallowing a package - a common means for mules to transport illegal drugs. The Saudi Press Agency reported that a statement from the Ministry said  a royal order was issued to execute the death sentence. It added that 'the Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is keen on combating narcotics due to their great harm to individuals and the society'. The statement concluded by saying the Ministry is 'warning anyone who tries to commit such actions that he will be punished according to Sharia'. Under the Saudi Sharia legal system it can actually be harder to avert execution for crimes without a specific victim, like drug smuggling, than for murder. Of the 59 people executed by mid-October, 22 had been convicted for smuggling drugs, according to figures compiled by Human Rights Watch from Saudi media reports. The fact that the heroin was found within the man's intestines suggests he would have ingested the drugs by swallowing a package - a common means for mules to transport illegal drugs (file pictures) One Saudi man, Mohammed Bakr al-Alaawi, was put to death for sorcery so far this year, the third such case since 2011. Although such cases are even rarer, judges can also demand execution for adulterers or Muslims who abandon their faith. In Saudi Islamic law, charges of violent crimes like murder are usually brought under the system of 'qisas', which is retaliation on the principle of an eye for an eye. While a murderer would normally be sentenced to death, the victim's family is permitted to accept 'diyya', or blood money, instead of execution. The lives of women are worth half those of men, and non-Muslims a fraction of the value of Muslims. A statement said King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is keen on combating narcotics due to 'their great harm to individuals and the society' Convicts from less wealthy backgrounds, or without tribal connections, who might intercede with the family or tribe of the victim, are more likely to die because it is harder for them to arrange a blood money payment. 'Any execution is appalling, but executions for crimes such as drug smuggling or sorcery that result in no loss of life are particularly egregious,' said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director for Human Rights Watch. Saudi Arabia has no civil penal code that sets out sentencing rules, and no system of judicial precedent that would make the outcome of cases predictable based on past practice. King Abdullah announced plans for legal reform in 2007, but judges, drawn from the traditionally conservative clergy, have so far succeeded is putting off meaningful change. In 2009 Abdullah replaced the long-serving, conservative justice minister with a younger scholar, Mohammed al-Issa. His attempts to introduce more modern training for judges and a system of precedent to make sentencing more predictable have so far been blocked by strenuous opposition from conservatives. Even Saudis who want reform generally do not oppose the use of the death penalty by public beheading. In the most extreme version of the Saudi death penalty, known by the Arabic word for 'crucifixion' and reserved for crimes that outrage Saudi society, the corpse is publicly hanged in a harness from a metal gibbet as a warning to others. An online film dated April 2012 on the LiveLeaks website shows a man being executed and then 'crucified' in this manner, reportedly for robbing a house and killing its occupants. A group of five men suffered this fate in May last year in the southern province of Jizan for a series of robberies.","Niaz Mohammad Ghulam Mohammad appears to have swallowed the drugs .

"The U.S. government has warned iPhone and iPad users to be on the alert for hackers who may exploit a vulnerability in iOS that would enable them to steal sensitive data. Cybersecurity firm FireEye says the bug enables hackers to access their devices by persuading users to install malicious applications with tainted text messages,emails and web links. However, it requires users to install an 'untrusted' app. Scroll down for video . Attacks can be used to steal banking and email login credentials or other sensitive data, according to FireEye . FireEye says there are three rules to follow: . Don't install apps from third-party sources other than Apple's official App Store or the user's own organization . Don't click 'Install' on a pop-up from a third-party web page, no matter what the pop-up says about the app. When opening an app, if iOS shows an alert with 'Untrusted App Developer', as shown in Figure 3, click on 'Don't Trust' and uninstall the app immediately . There was the potential for hacks using a newly identified technique known as the 'Masque Attack,' the government said in an online bulletin from the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center and the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Teams. Network security company, FireEye  disclosed the vulnerability behind the 'Masque Attack' earlier this week, saying it had been exploited to launch a campaign dubbed 'WireLurker' and that more attacks could follow. Hackers could potentially steal login credentials, access sensitive data stored on iOS devices and remotely monitor activity on those devices, the government said. Such attacks could be avoided if iPad and iPhone users only installed apps from Apple's App Store or from their own organizations, it said. Users should not click 'Install' from pop-ups when surfing the web. If iOS flashes a warning that says 'Untrusted App Developer,' users should click on 'Don't Trust' and immediately uninstall the app, the bulletin said. If installed, the malicious application can then be used to replace . genuine, trusted apps that were installed through Apple's App . Store, including email and banking programs, with malicious . software through a technique that FireEye has dubbed 'Masque . Attack.' These attacks can be used to steal banking and email login . credentials or other sensitive data, according to FireEye, which . is well-regarded in cybersecurity circles for its research. 'It is a very powerful vulnerability and it is easy to . exploit,' FireEye Senior Staff Research Scientist Tao Wei said . in an interview. Wei said that FireEye disclosed the vulnerability to Apple . in July and that representatives with the company have said they . were working to fix the bug. An Apple spokesman told MailOnline: 'We designed OS X and iOS with built-in security safeguards to help protect customers and warn them before installing potentially malicious software. 'We’re not aware of any customers that have actually been affected by this attack. 'We encourage customers to only download from trusted sources like the App Store and to pay attention to any warnings as they download apps. 'Enterprise users installing custom apps should install apps from their company’s secure website.' More information is available from the firm's support page. News of the vulnerability began to leak out in October on . specialized web forums where security experts and hackers alike . discuss information on Apple bugs, Wei said . Wei said that FireEye disclosed the vulnerability to Applein July and that representatives with the company have said theywere working to fix the bug. Last week researchers warned of a major threat called WireLurker. WireLurker monitors iOS devices, including iPods, iPhones and iPads, connected to a Mac via USB. The virus begins by infecting the Mac OS software, through malicious files or links. When a device is connected to this infected Mac, the malware automatically installs malicious apps onto the phone or tablet. The researchers said this malware combines a number of techniques to successfully 'realise a new brand of threat to all iOS devices'. The experts suggest iOS and Mac owners only download apps from the official Apple app store, and that they make sure to keep their software up to date. Wei said that FireEye decided to go public with its findings . after Palo Alto Networks Inc last week uncovered the . first campaign to exploit the vulnerability, a new family of . malicious software known as WireLurker that infects both Mac . computers and iOS. FireEye does not know of other attacks that exploit the bug, . Wei said. 'Currently WireLurker is the only one, but we will see . more,' he said. FireEye advises iOS users to refrain from install apps from . sources other than Apple's official App Store and to not click . 'install' on a pop-up from a third-party web page. The security firm said it verified this vulnerability on iOS . 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1 and 8.1.1 beta, for both jailbroken and . non-jailbroken devices.

"One of publishing's nastiest, most high-profile conflicts, the months long standoff between Amazon.com and Hachette Book Group, is ending. Amazon and Hachette announced a multiyear agreement, after Amazon had removed pre-order tags for Hachette books, reduced discounts and slowed deliveries in a row over e-book revenues. 'This is great news for writers,' Hachette CEO Michael Pietsch said in a statement. Amazon and Hachette have announced a multiyear agreement Thursday, Nov. 13, 2014, ending one of publishing's nastiest, most high-profile conflicts. 'The new agreement will benefit Hachette authors for years to come. 'It gives Hachette enormous marketing capability with one of our most important bookselling partners.' David Naggar, an Amazon vice president, said the company was pleased that the agreement 'includes specific financial incentives for Hachette to deliver lower prices, which we believe will be a great win for readers and authors alike.' The agreement takes effect early next year. Restrictions on Hachette books are being lifted immediately, according to the announcement, although delays on Carlos Santana's 'The Universal Tone,' J.D. Salinger's 'Nine Stories' and other works remained in place two hours after the news broke. The Amazon-Hachette dispute had dominated publishing headlines and conversations for much of the year. James Patterson, John Green and hundreds of authors from various publishers had condemned Amazon, and Hachette author Stephen Colbert mocked the online retailer, which prides itself on customer service. Meanwhile, Hugh Howey, J.A. Konrath and other writers published by Amazon had blamed Hachette and praised Amazon for keeping prices down and allowing authors unhappy with traditional publishers to release their work elsewhere. Amazon and Hachette had exchanged increasingly hostile press statements, with Amazon even invoking George Orwell (less than precisely) in its criticism of Hachette. Neither side had seemed to benefit. Hachette sales on Amazon.com, the country's biggest bookseller and dominant e-book seller, had dropped sharply. Amazon, meanwhile, issued a disappointing earnings report last month, although the impact of Hachette books was unclear. David Naggar, an Amazon vice president, said the company was pleased that the agreement 'includes specific financial incentives for Hachette to deliver lower prices, which we believe will be a great win for readers and authors alike.' Douglas Preston, a Hachette writer who had organized a public campaign against Amazon, wrote in an email Thursday that he was relieved by the news and hoped that 'if disagreements arise in the future between Amazon and publishers, Amazon will never again seek to gain leverage by sanctioning books and hurting authors.' Howey called Thursday's announcement 'great news' and wrote in an email that he was 'glad Hachette stopped this crazy campaign which only hurt itself and its authors.' Hachette was among five publishers sued in 2012 by the U.S. Justice Department for allegedly fixing e-book prices. The publishers, who had worried that Amazon was charging too little for e-books, settled and were required to negotiate new deals with Amazon and other retailers. Under the new agreement, Hachette set prices for e-books, 'and will also benefit from better terms when it delivers lower prices for readers.' Amazon last month reached a multiyear deal with Simon & Schuster, another publisher that was sued in 2012 and eventually settled. Like Hachette, Simon & Schuster will set e-book prices, a top priority for publishers. Thursday's news raised expectations that agreements with the remaining major New York publishers, HarperCollins, Macmillan and Penguin Random House, can be achieved without disruption. The terms also included a priority for Amazon: 'financial incentive for Simon & Schuster to deliver lower prices for readers.' Precise numbers were not announced for the Hachette or Simon & Schuster deals, but Howey noted in his email Thursday that for authors who self-publish through Amazon the retailer takes a higher percentage of revenues when e-books are above a certain price. Thursday's news raised expectations that agreements with the remaining major New York publishers, HarperCollins, Macmillan and Penguin Random House, can be achieved without disruption. 'Thank heaven,' Preston wrote Thursday, noting that he can resume his full time writing duties. 'My novel awaits.'

"A 'smart hat' could be the way of the future for Sydney cyclists with the idea being proposed as a safer alternative to the existing helmet. Its main feature being a registration plate on the back of the helmet along with an integrated camera, headlight, brake lights, indicators, drop down visor and a wiper system. The invention aims to combat the long-disputed issue of cyclists being registered road users like drivers. But the concept has been met with widespread criticism from cyclist groups, some labelling it is as a 'stupid' idea. A 'smart hat' could be the way of the future for Sydney cyclists with the idea being proposed as a safer alternative to the existing helmet . Feature include a registration plate (left) on the back of the helmet along with a drop down visor (right) The smart helmet also has automatic brake lights, head lights and night lights . The helmet also has a Bluetooth display with speaker, speedometer, speed zones, temperature, heart rate, tilt sensor, ultrasonic object proximity warning and turn signal indicators . The idea was put forward to Mosman Council - Sydney's north shore - by designer Toby King, which was welcomed by councillors who voted unanimously for the motion to be carried on Tuesday night. Councillor Simon Menzies, who supports the smart hat, told Daily Mail Australia that councillors were 'enthused' by the idea. 'It's encouraging to see the product and we hope it becomes a reality,' he said. In a detailed outline of the smart hat, Mr King wrote how current cycle helmets offer little protection to cyclists. 'Existing cycle helmets do not address any technical issues of integrating modern, electronic safety devices, data, or even standard road use indicators that are compulsory on all road registered vehicles,' he wrote. He offers a solution to these issues - that being, the smart helmet. The proposed helmet is said to be safer than the existing cycle helmet . There's also a separate storage compartment for smart phones on the back of the helmet . Mr King says the invention is 'aimed at increasing safety for the pushbike rider, other road users and pedestrians'. 'Additional factors should be in protecting the rider from head trauma effectively plus the ability to see and ride safely in bad weather for them and be seen by other road users in the same conditions,' he wrote. With the addition of licence plates on the back of the helmet, Mr King says this will allow for cyclists to be registered road users. 'Before now there has been no system available, which is readily adaptable and practical for cyclists in this regard,' Mr King wrote. 'It is the object of this product concept to attempt to rectify at least some of the deficiencies of existing practices in conjunction with regulatory authorities and associated organisations.' Other features of the helmet include ultrasonic object proximity sensing, GPS navigation, speedometer, detecting speed zones, temperature and heart rate. The proposal was introduced for council approval as a submission to the State Government as it is currently considering options to improve cycle safety on NSW roads. However groups such as cycle.org.au took to their Facebook page to express their disgust over the smart helmet. One baffled cyclist wrote: 'This is a great idea!! Said no cyclist ever.' While others wrote: 'That's the most stupid design ever' and 'I wish I had words, but I just can't get past the stupid. And then that helmet.'","Designer Toby King presented his concept to Mosman Council in Sydney's north shore .

Counting himself among the millions influenced by Nelson Mandela, President Obama mourned the death of the anti-apartheid hero with whom he shares the distinction of being his nation's first black president. 'He no longer belongs to us. He belongs to the ages,' Obama said in a somber appearance at the White House. Several celebrities who had personal ties to the late great leader, such as Oprah Winfrey and U2 frontman Bono, are also expected to attend the service. Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will be joined on Air Force One next week by former president George Bush . Former President Bill Clinton is also set to attend the state funeral and will be joined by Hilary Clinton . Nelson Mandela's unifying force will be evident in the guest list at his funeral which will include black and white world leaders, TV stars and musicians. U.S. President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle and their daughters will be joined by all past living U.S. presidents, including Bill Clinton, who knew Mr Mandela well. Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince Charles are believed to be in line to attend. Several celebrities who had personal ties to the late great leader, such as Oprah Winfrey and U2 frontman Bono, are also expected to attend the service. Desmond Tutu, a long-time friend of Mr Mandela and former archbishop of Cape Town is expected to hold the service. Preparations for funeral are expected to bring the country of 53 million to a virtual standstill. The . sheer number of dignitaries, including numerous heads of state, is sure . to spell a logistical nightmare for the South African government, which . will be tasked with providing air-tight security during the solemn . event. According to several sources involved in planning the state funeral, the 10-day occasion will combine both Western traditions and those of Mandela's native clan, the Thembu. At some stage during days one to four, Thembu elders are expected to gather for a first ceremony called 'the closing of the eyes' either at his home or in the mortuary. After the ceremony, it is believed his body will be embalmed at the mortuary, thought to be a military hospital in Pretoria. No formal public events are expected to take place until day five, December 10, when mourners will have a chance to say goodbye to their beloved father figure during a service at the 94,000-capacity Johannesburg soccer stadium that hosted the 2010 World Cup. It is not clear whether Mandela's casket will be taken there. On days six to eight, December 11 to 13, the anti-apartheid hero's body is earmarked to lie in state in a glass-topped coffin at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where he was inaugurated as president on May 10, 1994. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who met with then-94-year-old Mandela last August, will also journey to South Africa . Representing Britain: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha, seen with Mandela at a photo shoot for his 90th birthday in London, will pay their respects . On day nine, plans have been made for . a military aircraft to fly Mr Mandela to Mthatha, the main town in the . South African province of Eastern Cape. His . casket will then be taken by the military on a gun carriage to Qunu, . his home village, where the former leader spent his childhood years. To . mark the formal passing of responsibility to his family, the South . African flag that is expected to drape his coffin will be replaced by a . traditional Xhosa blanket. Later, ANC leaders, local chiefs and Mandela's family are expected to gather for a private night vigil. On . the final day, Mandela will finally be laid to rest in the grounds of . his family home in Qunu, where thousands of people, including heads of . state will gather for the state funeral. Giving thanks: All living former US leaders, including George W. Bush, pictured meeting Mandela in 2001, have been invited . Royal representation: The British Royal family, including the Queen and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will fly to South Africa to honour Mandela . Mr Mandela often spoke with great love of his first home where his family members, including his children who predeceased him, rest. The family plot is located just a few yards from the home he shared with his mother as a child and the one which he built following his release from Victor Verster Prison. He loved Qunu 'in the unconditional way a child loves his first home' and spent holidays and special occasions here. Star-studded event: The memorial service is expected to draw many celebrities who had a personal relationship with Mandela, including Oprah Winfrey pictured here in 2002 . Friends: U2 front man Bono, with Mandela at his Johannesburg home in 2002, is thought to have been invited . The protocol for the funeral . preparations was drawn up more than a year ago, around the time when Mr . Mandela's health took a turn for the worse, and it may be altered in the . coming days. Mourners . will be able to share their thoughts about Mandela’s passing in . condolence books that will be made available in all foreign missions, . the Nelson Mandela Foundation headquarters and other institutions, . according to The Guardian, which has obtained a copy of the protocol. It . has also been reported that the South African Government is in talks . with the BBC team that filmed the Royal Wedding in 2011 to get help with . the world wide broadcast of the funeral of a global icon. Guests at the funeral will include Mr Obama, the first lady and their daughters. Bill and Hillary Clinton, who knew Mr Mandela well, are also expected to make an appearance. The scale and significance of the planned funeral is already being compared to the 2005 service for Pope John Paul II, which was attended by 2million people, among them five kings and 70 presidents.

"Building new roads can be an arduous and back-breaking task but thanks to a Dutch inventor, paving is now as simple as rolling out a carpet. The amazing machine, named Tiger-Stone, can create an instant road wherever it travels, laying out bricks in formation to create perfect paving. While the process may look magical, the secret behind the invention lies in a smartly-designed gravity-based system. Scroll down for video . Roll out the red pavement: The amazing Tiger-Stone machine can create an instant road wherever it travels . Simple: All a worker as to do is load the bricks into the machine in the desired pattern and gravity does the hard work . All a worker has to do is load the bricks by hand from a hopper into the Tiger-Stone in the desired patten. From there gravity causes them to slide together, in a sheet of paving, onto the ground. Brick roads have long been sought-after due to their attractiveness and durability but have become less common because of the labour-intensive work that goes into laying them, compared to other road surfaces such as concrete or asphalt. However, with a Tiger-Stone workers are able to lay out 400 square metres of new road every day, using paving stones or bricks, compared to a single conventional paver on their hands and knees who would only be able to manage between 75 and 100 square metres. Invention: The machine is the brainchild of Henk van Kuijk after he decided that kneeling to lay the bricks was too labour-intensive . Perfect paving: The device is fed loose bricks and lays them out onto the road as it slowly moves along . The machine is the brainchild of Henk van Kuijk, director of Dutch industrial company Vanku, who came up with his ground-breaking invention after deciding that squatting or kneeling down to place the bricks into the ground by hand was too much like hard work. The device, which is as wide as a road and comes in four, five and six-metre widths, is fed loose bricks and lays them out onto the road as it slowly moves along. The tread-tracked machine is electrically-powered, and has few moving parts, so noise and maintenance are kept to a minimum. Once the bricks are in place, all a contractor has to do is go over the new road surface with a tamper, and the new highway is complete. Swift work: The Tiger-Stone can lay out 400 square metres of paving a day, compared to the 75 to 100 square metres which could be done by hand .","Tiger-Stone can lay an incredible 400 metres of bricks a day .

"Ex Massey coal CEO Don Blankenship was indicted Thursday . The former CEO who oversaw the West Virginia mine that exploded in 2010, killing 29 people, was indicted Thursday on federal charges related to a mine safety investigation that followed the blast. U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said a federal grand jury indicted former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship on charges that include conspiracy to violate mandatory federal mine safety and health standards, conspiracy to impede federal mine safety officials, making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission and securities fraud. Blankenship could face up to 31 years in prison if convicted. The indictment alleges Blankenship conspired to violate mine safety and health standards at the Upper Big Branch Mine from January 2008 until April 2010, when an explosion at the mine killed 29 coal miners. Specifically, the indictment said Blankenship was part of a conspiracy to provide advance warning of federal mine safety inspections, allowing mine bosses to conceal and cover up safety violations. After the explosion, Blankenship made false statements and representations to the SEC concerning Massey Energy's safety practices prior to the explosion. He made similar statements in connection with the purchase and sale of Massey Energy stock, the indictment said. Alpha Natural Resources bought Massey for $7.1 billion in June 2012. Blankenship, who retired ahead of the merger, has denied any wrongdoing . Four investigations into the Upper Big Branch explosion found that worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited accumulations of coal dust and methane gas. Broken and clogged water sprayers allowed what should have been a minor flare-up to become an inferno. The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration said the root cause was Massey's 'systematic, intentional and aggressive efforts' to conceal life-threatening problems. MSHA said managers even maintained two sets of pre-shift inspection books — an accurate one for themselves, and a sanitized one for regulators. Southern West Virginia U.S. District Attorney R. Booth Goodwin II speaking to reporter in Charleston, W.Va. Goodwin said a federal grand jury indicted former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship on Thursday . The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration said the root cause was Massey's 'systematic, intentional and aggressive efforts' to conceal life-threatening problems.

"A plus size campaigner has slammed main street retailer Old Navy after the brand tried to claim that 'unique fabrics and design elements' were to blame for its female customers being charged more money for larger sizes, while the menswear designs remain the same price regardless of size. According to New York-based merchandiser Renee Posey, who is calling for the brand to scrap its 'discriminatory' plus-size up-charges, the discrepancy between the prices for larger men and women is nothing other than 'straight up fat shaming'. 'Plus size women like myself are kind of fed up with being treated like second-class citizens by retailers,' the 34-year-old told Today.com. 'I think it's reached critical mass and people are ready for a change.' The smaller the size, the smaller the price: Old Navy's popular Rockstar Super Skinny Jeans are $34.94 if bought in sizes 0 to 20 . Unfair increase: Any women who buy a pair of the Rockstar Super Skinny Jeans in a plus size fit will be charged an additional $10, bringing the total price up to $44.94 . After Ms Posey started a petition on Change.org, calling for the brand to change their gender-biased price policies, a spokeswoman for Gap Inc, Old Navy's parent company, released a statement blaming the increased costs for plus-size womenswear on the fact that the larger designs require additional details not found in the smaller sizes . 'For women, styles are not just larger sizes of other women’s items, they are created by a team of designers who are experts in creating the most flattering and on-trend plus styles, which includes curve-enhancing and curve-flattering elements such as four-way stretch materials and contoured waistbands, which most men's garments do not include,' spokeswoman Debbie Felix explained. 'This higher price point reflects the selection of unique fabrics and design elements.' But Ms Posey insists that the statement does not address why there is not a single increase for any of the larger menswear designs, particularly as they also require the use of additional materials. 'Every woman knows how hard it is to find a good pair of jeans: a pair that is the right fit at the right price,' she wrote on the petition. 'That’s why I was shocked when, during a recent visit to Old Navy’s website, I noticed that they were charging $12-$15 more for plus-sized women's jeans - but not up-charging jeans for “big” men. 'If they are charging plus-sized women more to cover the cost of the fabric being used, then why aren’t they doing the same for men? Fed up: Renee Posey (pictured) wants Old Navy to scrap its 'discriminatory' prices . Fighting for change: Ms Posey's petition has been signed by more than 33,000 people . 'I was fine paying the extra money as a plus-sized woman, because, you know, more fabric equals higher cost of manufacture. However, selling jeans to larger-sized men at the same cost as they sell to smaller men not only negates the cost of manufacture argument, but indicates that Old Navy is participating in both sexism and sizeism, directed only at women.' And it seems that Ms Posey is not alone in her opinion; thus far her petition has gained the support of more than 33,000 people, with many agreeing that Old Navy's 'unfair' prices should be scrapped once and for all. 'I wear a plus size, and have noticed that other stores these sizes may be a bit higher in price, but not to the extent that old navy charges,' supporter Dorei Sparrowhawk commented on the petition. Plus size discrimination: Old Navy offers a variety of plus size designs but . 'And in other stores, men are also charged higher for plus sizes. Why does old navy penalizes us because we are women? This discrimination needs to stop.' While many brands charge more for their plus size collections, blaming the additional fabric for the increased costs, the majority implement the same - or similar - price adjustments for both men and women. 'When you’re talking about needing more yardage, it’s going to be more expensive - but that’s true for men as well,' Christine Hunsicker, chief executive of Gwynnie Bee, a monthly subscription service for plus-size clothing told Today.com. 'It doesn’t actually make sense to me why men’s is not priced differently.'","Plus size campaigner Renee Posey has slammed the brand's 'discriminatory' prices which see only women charged more for larger clothing .

"A first grader in Maryland was suspended after his teachers said that he threatened to shoot another student by making a hand gesture of a gun. Adding to that, teachers also were scared because Rodney Lynch allegedly said 'pow' while doing the motion. This is not the first time since the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut where a student has been suspended for making a preconceived threat of violence, but it may be the youngest: Rodney is only 6-years-old. Demonstrating: Rodney Lynch, 6, made the gun hand symbol three times in one day at school . 'His record says suspended for . 'threatening to shoot a student' and that's a lie,' his family's lawyer . Robin Ficker told ABC News. In their view, his actions were those . of a young boy who thought he was just joking around with friends, but . school officials took a different side. The timing of the incident did not help his case, as the child made the gesture one week . after the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in Connecticut where 20 . students and six teaching staff died. Roscoe R. Nix school's assistant principal Renee Garraway wrote to the boy's parents and told them that it was not the first time the boy had threatened another student. Suspended: Rodney was kicked out of school for one day before Christmas break and now will have the move on his permanent record . Concerned: The boy's parents want the suspension scrubbed off his record . Garraway wrote that the 6-year-old had been sent to the assistant principal's office twice on December 20th and told not to make that hand gesture. 'Yet, after meeting with the counselor and assistant principal, Rodney chose to point his finger at a female classmate and say ""Pow,""' the letter reads. Rodney maintains that he was not the one to say 'pow'- arguing that his friend who was making a similar hand gesture was the one to add sound effects. 'And I'm the one that gets suspended for just nothing,' he said to ABC News, rolling his eyes. During the third visit to the principal's office, the boy was questioned about whether or not his parents owned guns, and what if any video games he played at home. Suspension: The elementary school in Montgomery County was holding a conference about the December  incident as students returned from holiday today . Ficker, the boy's attorney, told the Washington Examiner: 'What they're doing is looking at the worst possible interpretation of a young, naive six-year-old. 'This is a little child who can't form the intent to do anything like that.' The lawyer said the child's parents were not aware of previous behavioral issues and were concerned that the incident would remain on his record indefinitely. The ruling can be appealed within ten days. There have been heightened tensions . at schools across the U.S. since the shooting in . Newtown, Connecticut on December 14.

Superintendent Janet Robinson said they will try to make everything as normal as possible for the children. 'We want to get back to teaching and learning,' she said. 'We will obviously take time out from the academics for any conversations that need to take place, and there will be a lot of support there. 'All in all, we want the kids to reconnect with their friends and classroom teachers, and I think that's going to be the healthiest thing.'","Student was suspended for one day in December at Roscoe R.

"Alex Salmond will demand the power to hold another independence referendum in return for propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street next year. The outgoing First Minister has revealed his price for the SNP's support should there be a hung parliament following May's General Election. The move raises the prospect of Mr Miliband facing the unenviable choice of running a majority government or risking another vote on the future of the Union. Scroll down for video . Outgoing First Minister Alex Salmond has revealed his price for the SNP's support should there be a hung parliament following May's General Election . Mr Salmond makes his final appearance at First Minister's Questions today  after more than seven years in office. As his 'divisive' reign comes to an end, Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael has called on his successor Nicola Sturgeon to 'hit the reset button' and fix the relationship between Westminster and Holyrood. Mr Carmichael blasted the Scottish Government for 'taking its eye off the ball' in recent years and urged ministers to focus on their 'day jobs' now that voters have rejected separation. He also singled out Education Secretary Mike Russell for failing to 'respect' the result of the referendum after the minister blamed a fall in teacher numbers on those who support the Union. But Mr Salmond, 59, used a press conference yesterday to insist that independence will happen within his own lifetime. He also backtracked from his pre-referendum vow that September's contest was a 'once in a generation, perhaps even a lifetime, opportunity' and said another referendum could happen 'sooner' than Unionist supporters would like. His comments will alarm more than 2million Scots who turned out to reject independence, many of whom are still recovering from the divisions caused by the constitutional battle. Mr Salmond is widely expected to launch a bid to return to Westminster as an MP once he hands over power to Miss Sturgeon, where he hopes to be 'kingmaker' following next year's General Election. In an interview with Newsweek Europe to be published tomorrow, the SNP leader suggests he would also fight for voters in northern England. 'Who knows, there might be one or two things we can knock off for the good citizens of Liverpool and Newcastle, because they badly need a champion of some sort,' he said. 'Is England going to be safer in my hands or in the hands of this coalition government or of Nigel Farage? Much safer in my hands. I'll do my best.' Ed Miliband has seen a collapse in support for Labour in Scotland, with voters switching to the SNP . The SNP will not enter a formal coalition with the Tories, but has not ruled out a deal with Labour. However, should the arithmetic allow it, a 'confidence and supply' system is more likely where the party's MPs would vote against any no confidence vote in a Labour-led government and would allow its budget to pass. 'There is plenty of scope to find things which are really important to you but are really not that important to the government,' he told Newsweek. 'It wouldn't be the greatest tragedy in the world, for example, for Westminster to accept the reality that the Scottish parliament should run its own elections, its own referendum.' Elections are currently reserved to Westminster and the recent referendum was only made legally-binding following a temporary deal between David Cameron and Mr Salmond. The First Minister claimed the threat to the Union by handing over this power would not be of 'immediate pressing concern [to Westminster] compared to the enormity, for example, of Ed Miliband's survival as Prime Minister, which I am sure he would in that situation believe to be of the ultimate importance to the future of everything.' Last night, a senior Scottish Labour MP said the idea was a non-starter because there would be no mandate to devolve elections and it would be 'going against the settled will of the Scottish voters'. Mr Carmichael said it is time to leave the constitutional debate behind. 'For us all in politics, there's a job of work to be done now to move Scotland on from being divided between the 55 [per cent who voted No] and the 45, to heal some of the deep and quite understandable divisions that there were in the course of the referendum,' he said. 'With Nicola taking over the reins as SNP leader and then as First Minister next week… I hope that this will be a point when we can hit the reset button on the relationship between the two governments.' Mr Carmichael criticised comments made by the First Minister about the prospect of another referendum on independence. 'I'm hoping that once some of the dust settles that they will accept that we're not returning to the referendum question any time soon, because principally that would be very bad for Scotland's economy,' he said. But during a press conference in his official Bute House residence yesterday, Mr Salmond said: 'It's the people who decide whether a constitutional referendum should be held. 'I did see a number of indications in two polls last week that at least there is strong support among the people of Scotland for a constitutional referendum rather sooner.' Asked if he thought independence would happen within his lifetime, he replied: 'Yes indeed.'","Outgoing First Minister reveals price for SNP support in a coalition .

"Having bad sex is one thing, but writing badly about it has to be even worse for a novelist. Some of the world's greatest writers have produced cringeworthy stuff over the years when describing the act of lovemaking in their prose, and Australian writer Richard Flanagan is the latest culprit. His literary mix of body circumnavigation, knicker elastic, a howling dog and a dying fairy penguin in his latest novel has now put him in line for an award that pays tribute to 'poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description'. Australian writer Richard Flanagan has been nominated for the Bad Sex in Fiction award . Mr Flanagan's masterpiece of love and death during the construction of the Burma Railway, The Narrow Road to the Deep North, may have won the 2014 Booker Prize, but it has also been short-listed for something not so well-regarded: London's Literary Review Bad Sex in Fiction award. The offending passage from the book that gained his nomination describes his characters 'circumnavigation of each other' which is then rudely interrupted by howling of a drooling dog carrying a half dead fairy penguin in its mouth. It's not the most romantic of images in reality. Written down, it doesn't come across much better. Knicker elastic, a howling dog and a dying fairy penguin are described in the sex scene in his latest novel . 'Whatever had held them apart, whatever had restrained their bodies before, was now gone,' Mr Flanagan writes. 'If the earth spun it faltered, if the wind blew it waited. Hands found flesh; flesh, flesh. 'He felt the improbable weight of her eyelash with his own; he kissed the slight, rose-coloured trench that remained from her knicker elastic, running around her belly like the equator line circling the world. As they lost themselves in the circumnavigation of each other, there came from nearby shrill shrieks that ended in a deeper howl. 'Dorrigo looked up. A large dog stood at the top of the dune. Above blood-jagged drool, its slobbery mouth clutched a twitching fairy penguin.' If he wins Mr Flanagan will join the likes of Sebastian Faulks, Norman Mailer and A.A. Gill . Established by Auberon Waugh in 1993, the purpose of the prize is to draw attention to poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction, and to discourage them, and is not intended to cover pornographic or expressly erotic literature. The Legacy Of Elizabeth Pringle - Kirsty Wark. But Mr Flanagan is in esteemed company as the likes of Sebastian Faulks, Norman Mailer and A.A. Gill are previous winners of the dubious award. He'll be up against tough competition, however. Pulitzer prize-winning author Michael Cunningham is a front-runner for his description of a male climax. 'He lives for seconds in that soaring agonising perfection.

"Improvement: Great Yarmouth Primary Academy headmaster Chris Holledge says that the extended hours at the school are already having a positive impact . One of the worst-performing primary schools in the country has introduced a 45-hour week for pupils in a bid to transform results. Pupils at Great Yarmouth Primary Academy stay at school from 7.45am until 6pm - longer than the standard working week. Under the radical timetable, they enjoy a free programme of after-school activities ranging from horse-riding to cookery, followed by supervised time in which to complete their homework and read. In its former incarnation as Greenacre Primary, the Norfolk school was among the bottom 200 performers out of 15,000 primaries nationally and was condemned by inspectors as failing in 2010. The new programme was introduced last September as the school became a semi-independent academy sponsored by millionaire businessman Theodore Agnew. At first parents were horrified by the idea, with 100 signing a petition to block the changes. But headmaster Bill Holledge says the extended school day is already leading to ‘real improvement’ in children’s results just a term after it was introduced. School starts at 8.55am, although pupils are able to attend a free breakfast club from 7.45am. The standard school day finishes at 3.30pm but those aged seven to 11 are able to stay on for a free programme of extra-curricular activities in sport, drama or music. Classes include horse-riding, cookery, cello lessons, first aid, street dance and trips to Cambridge University to study rocket engineering. At 5pm, youngsters in the final two years of the school - nine to 11-year-olds in years five and six - spend a further hour completing homework or practising reading under supervision from teaching assistants. The extended timetable was introduced with the aim of giving pupils the same opportunities as youngsters from more advantaged backgrounds and those in private schools. It was also intended to help working parents by allowing them to collect their children at 6pm instead of 3.30pm. The experiment initially proved controversial with parents who were concerned it would rob children of family time and leave them exhausted. Fun: Pupils at the Great Yarmouth Academy Primary take part in a range of extra-curricular activities after school including horse-riding and cookery lessons (file picture) A petition opposing the scheme attracted more than 100 signatures and 13 pupils were withdrawn from the school before it became an academy, with some parents openly blaming the shift to a longer school day. But Mr Holledge said pupils had embraced the scheme. ‘It’s been really positive. The vast majority of the pupils are staying and benefiting from the activities,’ he said. ‘The study time part has been tremendously successful and we’re seeing real improvement in the pupils’ attainment. ‘It’s very settled and calm like it’s been in place forever. ‘To start with it felt like a scary adventure, but now it’s what we do and parents have been very supportive. Backing: The school is one of a number adopting extended opening hours after the idea was controversially approved by Education Secretary Michael Gove . ‘I would say the confidence change has been almost more marked than the academic. ‘The drama and dance has been very productive and given them confidence. They’re more conversational and sociable now.’ The extended timetable is being championed by Mr Agnew, an insurance industry executive, who has personally funded the enrichment programme to the tune of £50,000 this year, rising to £100,000 next. Explaining the rationale for the scheme, the Tory party donor lamented a widespread ‘apartheid’ between the educational haves and have-nots. ‘Our vision is to show that no matter how deprived a child’s background, given a good, broad and structured education there is no reason why they cannot emerge from their primary schooling as every bit as capable and alive to the opportunities that life will present to them as those from more privileged backgrounds,’ he said. ‘I am determined to end the apartheid in education that is so commonplace in this country.’ Greenacre Primary had been under-performing for several years with a succession of head teachers quickly moving on. The school, where significant numbers of pupils qualify for free meals due to low household income, was finally taken off the failing list in November 2011 under the leadership of Mr Holledge. It became a sponsored academy nearly a year later with a brief to rapidly improve pupil results. The school is among growing numbers moving to an extended day after Education Secretary Michael Gove backed the idea last year, to the fury of teaching unions. ‘We are all in favour of longer school days, and potentially shorter summer holidays,’ he said. At Great Yarmouth Primary Academy, there is no compulsion on teachers to take part. Study time at the end of day is staffed by classroom assistants, who are paid extra. Rachel de Souza, chief executive of the Inspiration Trust which runs the academy, said the scheme was helping children to ‘grow in confidence’ and ‘stand taller’. Initial monitoring of pupils’ results suggested it was already reaping benefits, she said.‘In the independent sector it costs £22,000-a-year to get this kind of quality education,’ she added.","Great Yarmouth Primary Academy students attend school from 7.45am till 6pm .

"Only a handful of people were able to speak on a proposal that could make the tiny Massachusetts town of Westminster the first in the nation to ban all sales of tobacco products when boos and shouts from the crowd shut down the public hearing Wednesday night. Sixty or more residents in the packed Westminster Elementary school gymnasium were registered to share their opinions. Some among the audience of several hundred toted signs opposing the ban; some had participated in a rally earlier. Scroll down for video . Only a handful of people were able to speak on a proposal that could make the tiny Massachusetts town of Westminster the first in the nation to ban all sales of tobacco products when boos and shouts from the crowd shut down the public hearing Wednesday night . Residents listen during a public hearing in Westminster, Massachusetts . But amid shouts of 'America!' and 'Freedom Now,' Board of Health chairwoman Andrea Crete gaveled the hearing to a close just 25 minutes into it instead of taking comments. 'The crowd's getting out of control and the room's filled to capacity,' she said. 'We don't want any riots.' Crete and the two other board members were escorted out by police, and the crowd dispersed. She said the board would accept written testimony until Dec. 1 and would vote later. She didn't specify a date. 'I'm disappointed that we didn't get to have the hearing,' she said. 'We're trying to save lives and prevent children from being future users.' Westminster Board of Health chairman Andrea Crete, right, is swarmed over by media, after she shut down the meeting on the proposed tobacco ban after the crowd became unruly . Citizens hold signs at the Westminster Board of Health meeting on the proposed tobacco ban, at the Westminster Elementary School, Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2014, in Westminster, Ma. A public meeting on a central Massachusetts town's proposed first-in-the-nation ban on tobacco and nicotine sales ended early Wednesday because officials say the crowd was getting too unruly to continue. (AP Photo/Worcester Telegram & Gazette, Steve Lanava) Joyce McGuire, a Westminster resident and nonsmoker who opposes the ban, also was disappointed the hearing ended early. 'I think people are really angry because they feel this is being shoved down their throats,' she said. And with the proposal drawing national media attention, she added, 'I think we all feel really embarrassed. I don't think this is the way our town is.' The decision rests solely with the board, which says it is fed up with bubblegum-flavored cigars, electronic cigarettes and other new products that appeal to young people. Board members say the easiest course of action is to enact a total ban on all sales within town lines. A resident waves a US flag (L) and a second holds a sign reading 'What's Next?' while shouting, after the chairwoman of the Board of Health . One supporter, nonsmoker Vicki Tobin, said earlier that she'd like to keep cigarettes out of sight — and mind — of her three young boys. 'I just think it's a great step in a positive way to promote a healthy town, a healthy lifestyle,' she said. Shopkeeper Brian Vincent, whose country store on Main Street sells $100,000 worth of tobacco products a year, said he's collected at least 900 signatures on a petition against the ban. He said smokers will simply make their purchases in other towns and probably buy their gas and groceries there as well. A resident waves a US flag while disrupting the town hearing . 'Having other adults decide what legal item we're not allowed to consume just makes you wonder: If this passes, what could be next? Sugar? Bacon?' he said. Tobacco industry groups also have called the proposal a 'bad policy' that would harm local employers. The American Lung Association said Westminster would be the first community in the U.S. to take such sweeping action.","Sixty or more residents in the packed Westminster Elementary school gymnasium were registered to share their opinions but only a few spoke before boos and shouts shut the hearing down .

"They had smiled and posed for photographs on the red carpet and then enjoyed an animated conversation with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. And if Zindzi and Zenani Mandela had any idea that their father's long life was drawing to a close, they did not betray it for a minute. Then, in a single instance, everything changed. As they were about to watch the London premiere of his incredible story, the sisters were apparently told that the 95-year-old had died peacefully at home after months of illness. Tearful and flustered, they tried to compose themselves. The two women were said to have left the cinema immediately, but when asked if they wanted the film - Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom - to continue, they said yes. It was an extraordinary premiere. Few in the Odeon auditorium in Leicester Square knew what had happened and settled down to enjoy an evening celebrating one of the most iconic figures of the 20th century. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were informed of his death discreetly by an aide shortly before the end of the movie. The Queen today expressed her shock at . the timing of Mr Mandela's death, saying: 'It was extraordinary because . William and Catherine were at the film. 'They . were clapping like mad and somebody came on and said, ""can you just . listen please, we have just heard he has died"". It is amazing isn’t it. During the first night of his film.'

There were screams and gasps of shock while some burst into tears. A two . minutes' silence was held. Eleanor . Simmonds, 54, from Croydon, who was at the premiere to support a . Mandela charity, said: 'There was an audible sharp intake of breath. It . was shocking news to hear at the end of the film. Everyone was shocked,' she said. 'I was really, really sad news because it was a wonderful . evening.' William . and Kate looked ashen-faced as they walked down the stairs into the . foyer. Speaking as he left the Odeon cinema, the Duke said: 'I just wanted to say it's . extremely sad and tragic news. We were just reminded what an extraordinary and inspiring man Nelson Mandela was. 'My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. It's very sad.' Shortly after the Royal couple left, shocked members of the audience began . emerging from the cinema, in silence at first.

Stopping the screening was discussed after she was informed of her father's death, but Mandela's daughters asked that the film continue, a spokesman with the production said last night.

"Snakes don’t rank very high on the list of items you want to find inside your handbag, but that’s exactly what happened to a Queensland grandmother on a picnic with her grandson. Marilyn Condon was relaxing in Tygum Lagoon in Waterford - 30 kilometres south of Brisbane - last Sunday, when her nine-year-old grandson noticed a red bellied blacksnake taking shelter from the sun inside her bag. The snake, native to eastern Australia, is considered highly dangerous, with a rating in the top 20 most venomous land snake bites in the world. Scroll down for video . This red-bellied black snake surprised a grandmother having a picnic with her grandson at the weekend . Logan snake catcher Grant Browne received a call at about midday. He explained that he had to call the local council before driving to the park. ‘They said they had just seen a two foot snake heading into the bag. Since it wasn't somebodies residence I needed to get the go ahead from the local council. ’ ‘It’s natural that they would want to escape into the bag-they might look scary but they’re very placid snake and prefer to avoid confrontation.’ The snake had crawled into the woman's handbag, before people tipped it out of the bag and chased it away . By the time a snake-catcher got to the park he had to locate it in the shrubbery beneath a tree . Mr Browne was in for an easy days work, but he arrived to find that some other bystanders had pushed the bag over and chased the snake away with some sticks, leaving him to relocate it. They advised him that it had gone towards a local tree, and knowing that the slippery serpent was unable to climb, he knew it must be hiding in the grass. Mr Browne said it was a unusual occurrence. ‘There were lot’s of people around-with how timid these snakes are, I find it very odd that they would be hanging around so close to the crowds.’ But in the end he managed to catch the creature and take it to an isolated forest area.

"A former Young Liberal  vice president has been forced to quit the party after it was revealed he was once involved with a neo-Nazi organisation. Pictures have emerged of Scott Harrison making a 'Heil Hitler' Nazi salute at a skinhead event in 2010, while he's previously called on white people to carry firearms for intimidating 'racial enemies'. Mr Harrison was the vice president of the Young Liberals in Geelong, 75km southwest of Melbourne, and was also active in campaigning for key marginal Liberal candidates, including Tony McManus in Lara and  Ron Nelson in Bellarine, both in south-western Victoria. The Age reported on Wednesday that Mr Harrison had resigned from the Liberal Party after they learned of his former affiliation with neo-Nazis, and now more evidence has surfaced about his former affiliation with the movement. Scott Harrison (right) pictured with Victoria Premier Denis Napthine in March this year at a Deakin University Young Liberals event. News surfaced on Wednesday that Harrison was formerly affiliated with the neo Nazi movement . Scott Harrison, centre, at a neo-Nazi gathering in 2010. The image was featured on anti-facist blog which exposed more of the Liberal campaigners sordid past . An anti-fascist blog run by Andy Flemming  has released some of Mr Harrison's posts on neo-Nazi community websites, as well as the salute image, which comes from a gathering of the Hammerksins  group in 2010. Mr Harrison, who works as an IT Support Technician, was also an influential figure in the Church of Creativity, another white supremacist Nazi group founded in the 1970s. He was vocal on forums such as Stormfront, which was linked to a spate of anti-Semitic hate mail in Sydney that made news around the world. In an article for the Church magazine, Mr Harrison alleged that the Port Arthur massacre, the deadliest shooting in the history of the English speaking world, was 'another jewish lie'. He also claimed 'it should be a key objective of Creators to awaken the White race to the realities of the Port Arthur massacre and the need for White people to remain armed and dangerous in the eyes of our racial enemies'. Mr Harrison initially joined the white-supremacist forums in 2005, in the wake of the contentious Cronulla riots. He posted hundreds of militarist messages under various pseudonyms. Mr Harrison had resigned from the Liberal Party after the party had learned of his six-year affiliation with the neo-Nazi movement, which included being an influential figure in the Church Of Creativity movement . Hate mail posted in letterboxes of the eastern suburbs of Sydney. The notes were tied to the white supremacist forum Stormfront, which Mr Harrison  used for half a decade before joining the Young Liberal party . In one post on Stormfront, he joked about images of of a female concentration camp. 'They are celebrating the girls graduation from Jewish strangulation school? Haha, jokes, haha!', he wrote. In another vile message, under the pseudonym HatemongerCA, Mr Harrisson called on all Caucasian people to join the white supremacist cause. 'History has shown us that the White Race is responsible for all that which we call progress on this earth call upon you to join with us today, to do what is right for your family and for your extended family.' Liberal state director Damien Mantach said in a statement 'the Liberal Party was unaware of Mr Harrison's previous affiliations. 'He has now resigned from the Party, effective immediately. Mr Harrison told The Age he had denounced his former views in 2010. 'I completely distance myself from my past ideology. I now realise how insane it was. I now believe in racial equality and gay marriage,' he said. Opposition scrutiny of government spokesman Martin Pakula said Mr Harrison's views may have breached racial vilification laws. He told reporters that while  people make mistakes in their youth, 'I think being a neo-Nazi is in a different category.'

"Research by Macmillan has shown that by 2016 361,000 people in Britain will be diagnosed with cancer each year (file picture) Almost 1,000 patients will be diagnosed with cancer every day by 2016, researchers warn. Ironically, the rise in life expectancy means many more adults are living to an age when they are at higher risk of the illness. But experts warn today that the NHS is facing a ‘cancer care crisis’ because it will not be able to adequately treat such high numbers of patients. The charity Macmillan Cancer Support says ‘cracks’ are already beginning to show as so many more patients are now waiting longer for vital scans and treatment. One woman with ovarian cancer said she was ordered to leave her bed whilst still recovering from chemotherapy because she had to make room. Research by the charity shows that by 2016 a total of 361,000 people in Britain will be diagnosed with cancer each year. This is 100,000 more than the 263,000 in 1996. The illness is becoming a growing financial burden and only yesterday charities warned that the Government may have to stop funding some life-extending drugs. They are very concerned that several vital treatments for breast and prostate cancer will no longer be available through the Cancer Drugs Fund. This is a pot of money set aside by the Government to pay for drugs which haven’t been approved by the rationing body NICE. But there is such high demand that the fund is running out of money and officials may decide to take some drugs of the list next month. The rise in cases is largely due to the aging population but it also partly down to lifestyle reasons such as obesity, smoking and alcohol. Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said the rise in cases was further evidence of the ‘frightening magnitude’ of the illness. ‘Cracks in the NHS are already beginning to show. Whichever party is voted in at next year’s election, they will face a colossal challenge to make sure the NHS is ready to support the wave of people who will be diagnosed with cancer during their time in power. ‘To avoid a cancer care crisis we must take action as a nation now.’ The latest NHS figures show that the number of trusts missing the target to treat patients within 62 days of first being referred by a doctor has doubled in a year. Last month, 64 failed to meet it compared to just 30 for the same period last year. The charity Macmillan Cancer Support says ‘cracks’ are already beginning to show as so many more patients are now waiting longer for vital scans (file pic) Patients say they are being made to feel like a ‘set of symptoms’ rather than humans because nurses are too busy to properly look after them. Mary Jerome-Ayling, 64, from Sussex, who had breast cancer, said she had to wait hours for a seat to become available for chemotherapy. ‘Waiting for hours in a windowless cubby-hole was added to the stress and discomfort of chemotherapy. There were never enough seats for patients and their carers,’ she added. ‘Staff were so rushed that sometimes the infusion would finish and I would be sat there waiting for half an hour just for someone to take it out of my arm. ‘You just wanted to get out of there. It was clear that the staff were under so much pressure and it made you worried that mistakes could be made.’","Experts warn that the NHS will not be able to treat such high numbers .

The Australian researchers tracked the body movements of 26 young men and women as they tried to walk in a straight line. They walked the 30ft course three times – once without a mobile phone, once while reading a text message and once while typing a message. Their gait clearly changed when using their phone – with sending a text having a bigger impact than simply reading one. Texting caused people to slow down, swerve off course and move their head from side to side. They also developed a distinctive posture as they strained to keep their eyes on the screen. A review on iTunes by Dandy Crush said: ‘This app gives the effect that the phone screen is like glass that you can see right through. ‘It looks like they blur it a little too to help the words stand out more, kind of like a little hint of frosted glass. ‘It works great and I hope it saves me from future mishaps.’ The app, described as the ‘smarter, safer way to type while you're walking', can be downloaded on the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.

"The world's most popular Pinterest users are earning up to $250,000 a year, thanks to an increasing number of lucrative endorsements and brand collaborations arranged via a select group of Pinterest-focused talent agencies. According to Kyla Brennan, founder of HelloSociety, one of the top Pinterest agencies in the country, big name brands, including Kmart, Sephora and Kate Spade, are lining up to work with her clients - many of whom boast upwards of 1.8 million followers on the site. 'Pinterest is built for commerce,' the 29-year-old, whose Los Angeles-based agency pulled 12.5 million in revenue last year, told Re/Code. Under the Pinfluence: Pinterest's most popular users can make as much as $250,00 a year, according to Kyla Brennan, whose talent agency HelloSociety launched this board for Sephora's Formula X nail polishes . Indeed, some of the projects her clients have worked on have proved so successful for brands that they have diverted funds away from advertising on other social media platforms in order to invest more money in Pinterest which, as she points out, is ripe for retail partnerships given its catalogue-like setup. According to HelloSociety's website, previous projects completed by its pinners include creating recipes to promote major motion pictures, shooting editorial-style outfit inspiration for clothing lines, and coming up with crafts inspired by the spokeswoman for an auto insurance company. Fashion and beauty brands such as Kate Spade, Gap and Sephora have commissioned boards from HelloSociety's 350-plus pinners. Intelligent design: 'Pinterest is built for commerce,' said 29-year-old entrepreneur Ms Brennan (pictured) As opposed to sites like YouTube, where overnight celebrities are made through viral success, many of Pinterest's most followed users are simply those who were early adopters of the platform, and thus were recommended to new users. One would be hard-pressed to name a famous 'Pinfluencer', and Ms Brennan understands why the idea of one making a six-figure sum could raise skepticism. 'People hear Pinterest star and they’re like, ""what?!"",' she said. 'But after three years of doing this, seeing clients making hundreds of thousands of dollars and quit their jobs and pin full time, it’s real.' Pinterest star: Lauren Zwanziger, of Nashville, Tennessee, has close to five million followers, and is represented by HelloSociety . She adds that it’s much harder to get a huge audience in Pinterest than on other social networks, making Pinfluencers particularly valuable. 'It’s just much rarer than something like YouTube, where you make one viral video and there you are,' she said.","Kyla Brennan, who runs Pinterest talent agency HelloSociety, helps top pinners land endorsement deals with brands such as Sephora and Kate Spade .

"It is not yet known if Australian journalist Peter Greste could be released from his seven-year jail sentence under Egypt's new extradition laws. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi issued a decree on Wednesday allowing him to repatriate foreign prisoners when it was in his country's 'supreme interests'. But Greste's boss, Al Jazeera English chief Al Anstey, said the latest twist was just another part of the confusing and unfair process. 'It defies logic, it defies justice they're still behind bars after 320 days,' he said on Thursday, reported 9 News. It is not yet known if Australian journalist Peter Greste could be released from his seven-year jail sentence under Egypt's new extradition laws . Greste, was sentenced in June along with Canadian-Egyptian national Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohamed, all from the Qatar-based television network. They were detained in December and convicted six months later of spreading lies to help a 'terrorist organisation' . Al Jazeera declared that the accusations against the three journalists are absurd. While Western governments and human rights groups have condemned the case, with the United Nations questioning Egypt's reputation and the independence of its judiciary. Al Jazeera English chief Al Anstey is concenred for Mohammed Fahmy, Peter Greste and Baher Mohamed . The three journalists are appealing the convictions on the grounds of flawed evidence. 'They had videos from other news organisations, family photos, they had the Gotye music video. It was totally irrelevant to the case,' Anstey said. The trio will have been behind bars for more than a year when they next appear in court on Janurary 1 to decide if their appeal will go ahead. Sisi said in July that he wished the imprisoned Al Jazeera journalists had been deported and not put on trial. He initially reacted to their sentencing by saying he would not interfere in court verdicts, but his subsequent comments suggested he might use his presidential power to pardon the journalists at the appeal. Greste's boss Al Jazeera English chief Al Anstey says: 'it defies justice they're still behind bars after 320 days' Anstey, who is in Sydney this week to meet with Greste's family and campaign for his release, is concerned about the prisoners' appalling confinement. 'They're living a nightmare every second of every day. They've got to be set free,' he said, 9News reported. The official news agency MENA quoted the presidential spokesman Alaa Yousef as saying 'this decision comes in the framework of upholding the nation's interests and preserving Egypt's international image'. Although, the report didn't mention the three imprisoned journalists - there are few other criminal cases involving foreigners in Egypt and none that have received as much international attention.","Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi issued a decree on Wednesday allowing him to repatriate foreign prisoners .

"People at opposite ends of the political spectrum don't just have different views - they even use their brains differently. Researchers have found liberals and conservatives use different parts of the brain when they make risky decisions and these regions can be used to predict which political party a person prefers. The new study by a team of political scientists and neuroscientists suggests that while genetics or parental influence may play a significant role, being a Tory or a socialist changes how the brain functions. Not on the same wavelength: Scientists have found that people who express different political views use their brains differently . Doctor Darren Schreiber, a researcher in neuropolitics at the University of Exeter, has been working in collaboration with colleagues at the University of California on research that explores the differences in the way the brain functions in American liberals and conservatives. In a previous experiment, participants had their brain activity measured as they played a simple gambling game. Dr Schreiber and his colleagues were able to look up the political party registration of the participants in public records. Using this new analysis of 82 people who performed the gambling task, the academics showed that Republicans and Democrats do not differ in the risks they take. However, there were striking differences in the participants' brain activity during the risk-taking task. The results may pave the way for new research on voter behaviour, showing better understanding of the differences in how liberals and conservatives think . Democrats showed significantly greater activity in the left insula, a region associated with social and self-awareness. However, Republicans showed significantly greater activity in the right amygdala, a region involved in the body's 'fight-or-flight' system. The results suggest that liberals and conservatives engage different cognitive processes when they think about risk. In fact, brain activity in these two regions alone can be used to predict whether a person is a Democrat or Republican with 82.9 per cent accuracy. By comparison, the longstanding traditional model in political science, which uses the party affiliation of a person's mother and father to predict the child's affiliation, is only accurate about 69.5 per cent of the time. Another model based on the differences in brain structure distinguishes liberals from conservatives with only 71.6 per cent accuracy. The model also outperforms models based on differences in genes. Dr Schreiber said: 'Although genetics have been shown to contribute to differences in political ideology and strength of party politics, the portion of variation in political affiliation explained by activity in the amygdala and insula is significantly larger, suggesting that affiliating with a political party and engaging in a partisan environment may alter the brain, above and beyond the effect of heredity.' The results may pave the way for new research on voter behaviour, yielding better understanding of the differences in how liberals and conservatives think. Dr Schreiber added: 'The ability to accurately predict party politics using only brain activity while gambling suggests that investigating basic neural differences between voters may provide us with more powerful insights than the traditional tools of political science.'","New study says while parental influence may play a role, being a Tory or a socialist changes how the brain functions .

"From dinosaurs to dolphins and birds, one artist has been inspired by nature to create incredible images of concept airplanes. Alex Brady set out to create aircraft that look streamlined, futuristic and beautiful, but experts are not convinced that machines based on the designs would ever be able to fly. The ‘100 per cent whimsical’ drawings are also influenced by popular sci-fi films as Mr Brady, 31, from Cambridge, wanted to draw 'instantly recognisable craft’ as iconic as Star Trek’s Starship Enterprise. Alex Brady set out to create machines that look streamlined, futuristic and beautiful, but experts are not convinced that machines based on the designs would ever be able to fly. This concept is based on a swan . While he has no background in aircraft design, Mr Brady has drawn jets for films and computer games that look like they could soar though the skies on other planets and in future times. ‘They look like they might fly but are strange and silly,’ he told MailOnline. Among the creatures which Mr Brady has based his designs upon, are: Warthogs, zebras and woodlice, marine creatures like manta rays, dolphins and jellyfish, birds such as swifts and swallows as well as the pterodactyl, a new extinct ancient flying reptile. While he has no background in aircraft design, Mr Brady has drawn jets for films and computer games that look like they could soar though the skies on other planets and in future times. This fighter jet looks a lot like a manta ray . The '100 per cent whimsical' drawings like this plane with flexible wings, based on the shape of a swift, are also influenced by popular sci-fi films as Mr Brady, from Cambridgeshire, wanted to draw instantly recognisable craft¿ as iconic as Star Trek's Starship Enterprise . Artist Alex Brady said that he is fascinated by dinosaurs and this terrifying war machine is inspired by pterodactyl, as well as his favourite films such as Space Odyssey and Aliens . He set out to draw machines that also act as ‘characters’ because of their animalistic qualities and hopes one day to design futuristic transport full-time for films and games. ‘I wanted them to look instantly recognisable and to make them look kind of friendly’ despite the fact that many war planes are built to kill people. He admits that he has never grown out of dinosaurs and is ‘stealing from the best’ that nature has to offer. They might look like classic visions of UFOs, but these innovative aircraft concepts were inspired by jellyfish. However, an engineer told MailOnline that they would need a new propulsion system that has not been invented yet to fly . The mechanical-looking monster is based on a warthog and was imagined over a physical model built by Steve Wheeler, who made the knives for Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film and Mr Brady has worked with to illustrate ideas from his sci-fi books . This futuristic mode of transport came about beacuse of Mr Brady's attempts to draw a kind of zebra. It would be driven by a human inside the machine's stripy body . ‘You can’t come away from watching a David Attenborough documentary without thinking about how beautiful and interesting nature is. And I’d love cars and planes to be beautiful and sculptural – a little like yachts are. Not just about the function of sailing.’ He said that  Steve Wheeler particularly inspires him because of his work for film director Peter Jackson, models of sci-fi vehicles and writing as well as films such as Star Wars and author Iain M Banks. Mr Brady creates his amazing drawings by first making 3D models using computer software called 3D Studio Max. He then draws on top of them in Photoshop and said that while the technique allows him great accuracy in his work, there are also ‘happy accidents of the pen’ that gives his work impact and lets them flow. These fighter jets with distinctive curved wings are inspired by seagulls. 'They look like they might fly but are strange and silly,' Mr Brady told MailOnline . A strange vision of the future? 'The vehicle in the foreground is something along the lines of a scarab or woodlouse. The plane is rather like a manta ray,' Mr Brady said . This design shows the wings of an imaginary aircraft flexing. 'I think from this angle it looks more like a porpoise or dolphin,' Mr Brady said . While some of the futuristic aircraft concepts certainly look like they can fly, Professor Ian Poll, of Cranfield Aerospace who is an expert in aerospace engineering and a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, is doubtful that the ideas would create a real flying machine. ‘Birds and dinosaurs are nature’s ultimate evolved flying machines,’ he told MailOnline . He said that Mr Brady’s art is fanciful and creative, but would probably not make for efficient aircraft built upon engineering knowledge.

This rather convincing-looking fighter jet was inspired by a dragon and a chicken and look like it has jaws . These sleek looking concpet aircraft were based on a bird called the storm petrel. However, an engineering expert said: 'Birds and dinosaurs don't have jet engines or propellers to accommodate and their propulsion is limited by bone and muscle - meaning that they have to flap - which is not very efficient at all' Mr Brady revealed that this curvy aircraft is based on a stylised painting of a swan on wall of the White Swan pub in Cambridge, showing that inspiration really is everywhere . ‘Birds and dinosaurs don’t have jet engines or propellers to accommodate and their propulsion is limited by bone and muscle – meaning that they have to flap – which is not very efficient at all.’ Professor Poll explained that if you design an aircraft around a bird, the best thing you could come up with is a copy of a bird. ‘If you design one around a jet or propeller you get something appropriate to the power those technologies generate and probably a large wing span for efficiency as well as a blended wing and fuselage (the aircraft’s body that holds the crew, passengers or cargo). Aeronautics expert Professor Poll said that some of the designs look as if they do have wings that integrate seamlessly the body of the aircraft, which could help them to fly. A line of forbidding fighter jets are lined up for imaginary action here, but were inspired by chickens . This futuristic aircraft looks at first glance like a marine monster, but was inspired by a small starling . He did concede that some of the designs look as if they do have wings and the body of the aircraft, which could help them to fly, but the circular design inspired by a jellyfish, which also looks like many popular visions of UFOs, is ‘out of the question’ in terms of engineering. ‘It would be really inefficient and you would need a different kind of propulsion system [than currently used] to make it fly,’ Professor Poll said. However, he said that Nasa’s prototype X-48B craft - which is a blended wing body concept and a cross between a conventional plane and flying wing design – does bear some resemblance to some of Mr Brady’s designs. An expert at the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) said: 'Most [of the drawings] look pretty unlikely but there is a lot of academic research into bio-inspired designs of many things. There is a lot to be learnt from nature but it is a lot more complex that copying the shape.' This cockpit-like structure was inspired by 'how starfish puke out their insides to eat', which Mr Brady finds fascinating but disgusting .

"Fresh charges: Ghoncheh Ghavami, of Shepherds Bush, London, has spent almost five months in jail in Iran but now faces new espionage charges . The British-Iranian woman jailed in Tehran for taking part in a peaceful protest outside a volleyball match is now said to be facing charges of spying that carry a potential six-year sentence. Ghoncheh Ghavami, from Shepherds Bush, London, has already spent almost five months in jail, but now Revolutionary Guards are reportedly intent on charging her with endangering national security. There is confusion as to what charges Miss Ghavami faces. Her lawyer said earlier this month she had been sentenced at the start of November to a year in prison for spreading propaganda against the state, but the judiciary on Monday denied any verdict has been reached. Then on Tuesday a spokesman for the Iran's judiciary told AFP that Miss Ghavami was being held for security reasons and over 'links with foreigners'. Claims she now faces charges of endangering national security have been repeated in The Times today, which reports that her case has become a struggle between political factions in Tehran. Hadi Sadeghi, deputy chief of the judiciary's cultural affairs department, told AFP on Tuesday Miss Ghavami was arrested for having 'acted against the security of the country and for links with foreigners'. He denied the lawyer's account that Miss Ghavami was detained over her presence near the volleyball stadium in Tehran. To explain the almost five months she has spent in detention, Mr Sadeghi said judges can order a provisional detention order to be extended for additional investigation of charges. The Times reports that Miss Ghavami's case has become a struggle between Iranian moderates who want to limit the damage from an incident that's caused international outrage and hardliners who want her to be charged with spying. Miss Ghavami was first arrested on June 20 at Azadi ('Freedom' in Farsi) Stadium where Iran's national volleyball team was to play Italy. She was part of a brief demonstration which began after female fans and even women journalists were told they would not be allowed to attend the game. She was released within hours but rearrested days later at a police station she had visited to reclaim items confiscated from her near the stadium. Her family have called on the British government to intervene, but there is little diplomats can do now Miss Ghavami has apparently become a pawn in an Iranian power struggle. Her brother Iman, who lives in London, told The Times: 'The Revolutionary Guard never knows how to back down. They were very unhappy when all she got was a year in jail. They're determined to make an example of her.' Miss Ghavami was initially held in the maximum security wing of Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where she had staged a hunger strike in protest at her treatment. She has since been moved to an open women's prison in Varamin, south of the capital, last week and abandoned her hunger strike. Relatives said she had lost 19lbs in weight . Protest: Miss Ghavami, circled, was arrested at this impromptu protest outside an international volleyball game which formed when women waiting to go inside were told they would not be allowed to attend . A spokesman for the Foreign Office told The Times: 'We are concerned that the outcome of Ghoncheh Ghavami's case is still unclear, and by reports she may be facing new charges. We urge the Iranian judiciary to follow due process.' Iran's volleyball federation has said the sport's governing body FIVB informed has reversed plans for Iran to host the under-19 world championships in 2015. The FIVB announced Tuesday that it has awarded the tournament instead to Argentina. The president of Iran's volleyball federation, Mohammad Reza Davarzani, said Ghavami's case was not related to volleyball and 'to make a connection between a non-sporting activity and our sport is unfair'.","Ghoncheh Ghavami from London has spent five months in jail in Tehran .

"The body of a pensioner lay undiscovered at a sheltered housing complex for a month - and was only found when maggots 'dropped down through light switches' in a residents' flat. The housing association which manages the site has apologised following the discovery at the complex in Maidenhead, Berkshire. Berkshire coroner's office said the man was believed to be Benigno Lacey, 74, but formal identification was still taking place. His body was discovered at Blandford House in the town after he was understood to have lain undiscovered for up to four weeks. The body of the pensioner is understood to have lain undiscovered at Blandford House sheltered housing complex for up to a month . The body was only found after maggots were discovered in the building's hallways. One Blandford House resident, who did not want to be named, said a neighbour had noticed maggots 'dropping down through the light switches' in her flat. He added they initially thought the smell was from a dead cat. The tenant says he and his neighbours estimate the man may have been dead for three to four weeks. He said: 'There are still flies flying around.' Housing Solutions manages the site and said it has now cleaned contaminated areas to get rid of the infestation. A letter to tenants from Housing Solutions said: 'It is with great regret and a heavy heart that I have to inform you that your neighbour has passed away. 'Unfortunately, due to the circumstances of the death Housing Solutions were unable to react as quickly as we would have liked. 'We are aware this is an unpleasant situation and apologise for the inconvenience caused.' The letter goes on to say the number of maggots should 'decline' as a result of the cleaning and the level of communal cleaning would be increased to'reduce any further impact on residents'. A spokeswoman from Housing Solutions said: 'Sadly one of our sheltered housing residents was found dead in his flat. Housing Solutions, who manage the complex, have issued an apology to residents for the inconvenience . 'This resident had signed a disclaimer that he did not want daily contact with our staff, just monthly health and safety visits. 'We would like to apologise to our customers for any inconvenience this has caused.' Police confirmed they were called to a property in Ashcroft Road on October 30. The death was being treated as unexplained but 'not suspicious' and the details have been passed to the coroner. As well as identifying the body, the coroner's office is trying to trace Mr Lacey's next of kin.","Man was believed to have lain dead in the flat for up to four weeks .

"Four schoolgirls have been left orphaned after a village butcher killed his estranged wife before leaping to his death from a multi-storey car park. Oliver Ruse, 37, was left ‘heartbroken’ after his wife Debbie left him and their four children and moved abroad. He is understood to have been upset further when she came back and requested access to their daughters and demanded half the family business, which was founded by his great-great-grandfather. Oliver Ruse - the village butcher in Long Melford, Suffolk - is suspected of having killed his wife before taking his own life yesterday . Mr Ruse's wife Deborah was found dead at the cottage she had been renting since the couple's recent split . Mr Ruse’s body was found at the bottom of a six-storey car park in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Police discovered his wife’s body a few hours later on Thursday afternoon when they went to her rented cottage 13 miles away in the village of Long Melford. Officers refused to reveal the cause of her death yesterday. Post-mortem examinations are due to take place over the weekend. The couple’s daughters, aged eight, 11, 12, and 16, were being comforted by family members last night. A family friend, who asked not to be named, said Mr Ruse had been on anti-depressants since his wife’s return, adding: ‘Nobody can quite believe that he did something so terrible. The whole village is in deep shock.’ Another friend said: ‘She [Mrs Ruse] came back and demanded half the business. Times are hard and it was just the last straw. Ollie was also a devoted father and he dreaded the thought of her becoming involved with the kids again.’ Another villager said: ‘He had custody of the kids and lived for his kids. He made sure they were always smartly dressed for school.’ Devastated friends and relatives said Mr Ruse loved his family and was a 'lovely man' Police stood outside Deborah Ruse's cottage after her body was found inside following her husband's death . Mr Ruse’s stepmother, Sheelagh – who married Oliver’s father Henry, 71, after his first wife died of leukaemia – said: ‘Everyone’s devastated. ‘Oliver was a very gentle man and bent over backwards to please Debbie. I don’t know what happened – a breakdown or something. I think he was still in love with her. He didn’t want her to leave him.’ The couple had met after Zambia-born Mrs Ruse, 39, had moved to the UK to study law. They married in 1998 but split up around two years ago and she moved to Brazil. Companies House files show that she remained a 49 per cent shareholder in the family business. There were conflicting explanations for the split. Some villagers claimed she had met a man through the internet. Others said she was a devout Christian who went to Rio as a missionary before returning two months ago. A family friend said: ‘Oliver did everything to accommodate his wife and treated her like a queen. When she got involved in a happy-clappy church, he got embroiled in it as well. Mr Ruse was the fifth generation of his family to run the village butchers, where flowers were placed today . The butcher fell to his death from the Parkway multi-storey car park in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk . When she walked out, he got a phone call from her at Heathrow, saying that she was about to fly to Brazil.’ Her rented two-bedroom cottage was 400 yards from Ruse & Son, which was founded by Mr Ruse’s great-great-grandfather in 1860. The fifth generation of his family to control the business, he began working there in 1998 and took it over from his father in 2007. The firm supplies a number of upmarket outlets and featured in the Jamie Oliver documentary, Jamie Saves Our Bacon. Curtains were drawn at the 16th century house in the village where Mr Ruse lived with his daughters. Suffolk Police confirmed that they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.","Village butcher Oliver Ruse suspected of having killed his wife, Deborah .
