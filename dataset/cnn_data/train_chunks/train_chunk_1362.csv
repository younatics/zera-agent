"Fatality: Carol Driver, a 61-year-old project manager, died on the D.C. metro system last night in a sea of smoke . This is the woman who died in a smoke-filled metro tunnel yesterday in Washington, D.C., after an electrical fire struck the subway system. Carol Glover, 61, was the only fatality in the accident yesterday, which also hospitalized 84 people and terrified hundreds more travelers passing through the capital's L'Enfant Plaza station. Glover, from Alexandria, Virginia, was a project manager for a communications company that does contract work for the federal government. Twenty-one people were still in hospital Tuesday night. However, the metro system itself had been returned to full service. According to Glover's LinkedIn profile, she had worked in the Beltway area for at least a decade, included stints at companies based in the Pentagon. She was described as 'a vibrant woman, dedicated mother and loving person', by a neighbor speaking to local TV station WUSA9. Officials in D.C. are yet to release her official cause of death, though witnesses from inside the metro carriage described a woman being overcome by smoke, despite commuters' efforts to revive her. One, a member of the local transportation board, described how a woman passed out, and passengers then took turns giving her CPR. He said he could not be sure it was Glover - but assumes it was as she is the only fatality. Jonathan Rogers told WUSA: 'She passed out, it was obvious she passed out, and then people were taking her pulse and were like I don't feel anything. 'A few of us were rotating doing compressions, mouth to mouth, and we did it for like 20 minutes and eventually, it wasn't doing anything'. Engulfed: Subway tunnels at L'Engatn Plaza were flooded with smoke after a major electrical fault Monday night . Choking: Commuters try to cope with the encroaching smoke, which sent 84 people to hospital after the fire was causing by arcing bursts of electricity . Accident investigators have said the fire was caused by 'electrical arcing' around a charged third rail on the subway. In total 84 people had to go to hospital, and two people were critically injured, on top of Glover's death. Some passengers have said it took an hour for emergency crews to reach them. Electrical currents, which usually power the trains, can spread to unexpected places when the third rail comes into contact with something that conducts electricity, potentially starting fires. The arcing in this case took place 335m ahead of the train, causing smoke to flood the tunnel from a point 240m to the south of l'Enfant Plaza, which led to the Pentagon. The National Transportation Safety Board said that its investigation into the accident could take as long as a year. Hub: Pictured above is the busy station Monday night, cordoned off after the disaster in the yellow line tunnel . Hard to breathe: Dozens of passengers were treated after breathing in the smoke whilst trapped underground . In a statement, Tom Downs, the chairman of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, apologized for the incident. He said that once the cause was determined, Metro was prepared to keep it from happening again. The smoke near the L'Enfant Plaza station, a key transfer point for five Metro lines, also caused major disruptions on other lines. Metro was running with delays on five of six lines on Tuesday. The system, which operates in Washington as well as the Virginia and Maryland suburbs, is the second busiest nationally in terms of passengers carried, after New York's subway network. The incident on Monday was the first on the Metro system involving a passenger death since a crash in June 2009 that killed eight riders and a train operator.","Carol Driver, a project manager for government contractors, died Monday .

"San Antonio Spurs power forward Tim Duncan made a powerful statement during his team's visit to the White House on Monday when he showed up to the presidential home without a tie. The 38-year-old NBA veteran plainly stood out among teammates--all of whom wore neckties--as they lined up behind the Commander-in-Chief. So does Duncan despise authority or dislike the president himself? Probably neither. If a 2005 quote is any indication, Duncan simply hates dress codes. Barrack Obama deigned to shake hands with Spurs power forward Tim Duncan despite the NBA veteran's refusal to wear a tie to their meeting Monday . When the NBA instituted a dress code for its players that year, Duncan told reporters exactly how he felt about it, the Washington Post points out. 'I think it's a load of crap. I understand what they're trying to do with hats and 'do rags and [retro] jerseys and stuff. That's fine. But I don't understand why they would take it to this level. I think it's basically retarded,' he said. He's also been noted by both Complex and Busted Coverage for his anti-fashion ways. Despite his refusal to dress in line with tradition, Duncan was named specifically by the president as he welcomed the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs to the White House on Monday. Despite the demands of his Bulls fandom, however, the President admitted the Spurs were 'hard to dislike.' 'First of all, they're old,' he said of the squad led by 38-year-old Tim Duncan. 'For an old guy, it makes me feel good to see -- where's Tim? Tim's got some gray. There's a few others with a little sprinkles around here. There's a reason why the uniform is black and silver.' Obama even specifically named the 38-year-old Duncan as he congratulated the team on for being NBA champs . Duncan was the only Spur not wearing a tie at the White House, where most people choose to wear ties . Fellow Spurs player Manu Ginobili told Washington Post sportswriter Michael Lee he didn't even try to coax the fashion-hating (nearly) 7-footer to wear a tie . As a father of two daughters, one of whom plays basketball, Obama praised the Spurs as the first NBA team to hire a woman assistant coach, and welcomed the wealth of international talent the team has brought to the league. 'It's the UN of basketball teams,' he said of a squad that features French players Tony Parker and Boris Diaw along with Argentina's Manu Ginobili. Italy, Brazil, Australia and Canada are also represented on their roster. 'They find folks who didn't have a chance someplace else and suddenly they figure out a way to make them shine as part of a team. In that sense, they're a great metaphor for what America should be all about,' said Obama, who was presented with a Spurs jersey with 'POTUS' written over its number one. The keen basketball fan also offered some serious analysis of the Spurs' style and its influence on the league, and praise for their bounce back from a crushing NBA finals loss to Miami in 2013, to beat the Heat in 2014. But he couldn't resist poking some fun at notoriously taciturn coach Gregg Popovich. 'I want the coach to know that he is not contractually obligated to take questions after the first quarter of my remarks,' Obama said. Duncan has long been known as an anti-fashion type. He also hates dress codes. In 2005, he called the then-new NBA dress code 'a load of crap'",President Obama invited the national champion San Antonio Spurs to Washington on Monday and only Duncan showed up without a tie .
"More details of Apple's Watch have been revealed in leaked screenshots from the app owners will use on their iPhone. Called the companion app, the shots reveal several new capabilities of the Apple Watch - including the ability to customise its display with a monogram. It also shows how users will rearrange the watch's display, moving the apps they want. Scroll down for video . The app reveals the icons on the watch face can be moved around from a user's phone . The Apple Watch will use three types of app. Notifications allow users to take action or respond right from their wrist such as turning the lights off after they've left the house, quickly accessing flight details at the airport, and rerouting their transit when a train or bus is late. Glances, which quickly show users information they care about most, such as the latest news and sports scores, alarm system status or the next step of a favorite recipe. Full apps can use a developer's own interface. 'Within Apple, the application is currently called the Apple Watch “Companion” app for iPhone,' said Mark Gurman of 9to5mac, who revealed the screenshots. 'This application manages settings for Apple Watch applications, as well as settings for iPhone/Watch interactivity.' Apple is putting the finishing touches to its Watch ahead of an expected launch in March - and yesterday released a test version of the software that will link it to an iPhone. The latest release of iOS 8.2, expected to be launched within weeks, includes references to the much anticipated watch. Apple Watch will link via Bluetooth and a special app on user's iPhone. 'Inside of the Bluetooth Settings menu is a new panel specifically for pairing an iPhone with the Apple Watch,' said Mark Gurman of 9to5mac. 'Additionally, the instructions inside of the Bluetooth menu specifically indicate that Apple will release a dedicated 'Apple Watch app' for setting up and controlling the wearable device. Apple has previously said the timepiece will be controlled by a special app. Apple Watch users will install an Apple Watch app on their iPhone, which will be used to download apps onto the watch as well as manage Apple Watch settings. A user’s iPhone is also used to help with computational demands, and help preserve the watch's battery life. Sources familiar with the product's development say that the device is currently on track to ship in the United States by the end of March, . The Apple Watch will link to a special app on the user's iPhone via Bluetooth. The app also reveals the iPhone's fitness capabilities (left) and the stock test messages users can use to reply from their wrist . So far Apple has refused to reveal exactly when it will be released, although a statement made to Apple employees suggests the release will be in 'the spring.' It has previously been claimed that suppliers were struggling to make enough screens and processors. However, breakthroughs have been made in the number of successful yields for the watch's display and processor, according to Taiwan's United Daily News late last year. Now 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman says Apple Store employees are set to be trained in February. 'One or two representatives from many Apple Stores in the United States, depending on store and market size, will be sent to Apple offices in either Cupertino, California or Austin, Texas to learn first-hand about the Watch,' he claims. The Apple Watch will be available in three versions: Watch, Watch Sport, and Watch Edition, a high end version made of specially developed precious metals. 'These training programs will take place between February 9th and February 16th.' The employees will then train the rest of their store's staff, it is believed. Unveiled on September 9 at Apple's iPhone 6 launch event, the Apple Watch is the company's foray into wearable computers. Samsung, LG, Motorola and Microsoft have already launched their own smartwatches, but Apple is expected to face unprecedented demand for its watch. Quanta, which is building the watch, has upped its number of workers from 2,000 to 10,000 and is ultimately aiming for 20,000. The initial round of shipments will be 3 to 5 million watches. Apple anticipates a total of 24 million watches will be shipped during 2015, according to claims - and mass production will start in January . Apple anticipates a total of 24 million watches to be shipped during 2015, G for Games said. According to 9to5Mac, Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail and online stores hinted at the release date when she told staff: 'We're going into the holidays, we'll go into Chinese New Year, and then we've got a new watch launch coming in the spring.' Apple's chief executive Tim Cook unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. He didn't announce exactly when the watch would be available, but said it would go on sale 'early next year.' Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications . The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri also is built into the Apple Watch. A 'source close to Apple' told The Information last month that the firm 'would be lucky to ship [the watch] before Valentine's Day'. Chinese New Year falls on 19 February next year, so Ms Ahrendts comments push it at least beyond this date. Despite the range of impressive features unveiled by Mr Cook, there was something he failed to mention: battery life. The telling omission suggests the watch's battery life will be the Achilles Heel of the device when it eventually does go on sale. Apple is said to be unhappy with the watch's battery life, and the long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. Although he didn't reveal battery life details, Mr Cook did spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple's MagSafe technology with inductive charging . Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as Pebble and MetaWatch, tend to last up to a week on a single charge. The closest Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch was saying that users would 'charge it at night.' During an interview in Bloomberg Business Week, Apple's senior vice president of operations Jeff WIlliams said: 'We want to make the best product in the world. 'One of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt, but nobody is wearing them.' The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch 'can be worn all day, for any occasion,' but hourly figures were notably absent. A source said Apple is unhappy with the watch's battery life, according to Re/Code. Another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life 'is about a day now.' The watch has a completely new user interface (left), different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown' (right) presented by chief executive Tim Cook . The company's chief executive added the Apple Watch 'can be worn all day, for any occasion,' but hourly figures were notably absent. The long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year . A spokesperson for Apple declined to provide battery details to MailOnline and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year. Like many of Apple's other products, the Apple Watch appears to have a sealed back, which means the battery cannot be replaced. This suggests that the entire $349 (£216) device will have to be replaced, once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use. Another concern is the launch of the health and activity-tracking apps on the Apple Watch, which will rely on adequate battery life for round-the-clock monitoring. Companies including Fitbit and Withings have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too, monitoring sleep patterns through movements. However, if the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed by the gadget which Apple says will 'motivate people to be more active and more healthy.' Apple did, however, spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple's MagSafe technology with inductive charging. Apple's silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature. The success of the device could hang on whether or not it manages to do it in time.","Watch will link via bluetooth and a special app on user's iPhone .

"Antlers discovered by walkers on a beach in the Lake District, could be 20,000 years old, one has expert claimed. Rod Scarr and his daughter Carol found the antlers poking out of the muddy shore with a large section of deer skull, on Walney island, off the coast at Barrow, Cumbria. In April 2012, an eight-year-old called Jamie Cassidy found a perfectly preserved 3ft (91cm) high antler on the same beach, which were at the time was thought to be 4,000 years old - but it could be much older. What a find! Antlers (pictured) discovered by walkers on a beach in the Lake District, could be 20,000 years old, one expert claims, but carbon dating is required to make sure they are as old as suspected . Carbon dating is needed to ascertain the precise age of both specimens. David Gelsthorpe, Manchester Museum’s curator of earth sciences, has examined photos of the antlers, which are believed to belong to a two-year-old red deer. He said: ‘We have found similar material from 10 to 20,000 years ago in the North West, so that is why I suggested that figure for the age. ‘For example there was a similar skull found when they were digging the Manchester Ship Canal in the 1880s. Rod Scarr and his daughter and Carol (pictured) found the prehistoric antlers poking out of the muddy shore with a large section of deer skull, when on a leisurely walk . The interesting remains were found on Walney island, off the coast at Barrow, Cumbria (marked on the map) Dutch fossil hunters have hauled woolly mammoth bones from the North Sea, which was icy tundra 40,000 years ago. The group of archaeologists, salvagers and palaeontologists trawl the waters off the east coast of Rotterdam at a depth of 100 feet (30 metres) and in 2010 discovered bones belonging to an 11ft (3.4 metre) tall mammoth. They collected its skull, tusks and other large bones, and filled in any missing ones with finds from similar beasts discovered nearby of a similar age, to form a complete skeleton after months of work. They also uncovered bones belonging to woolly rhinos and Irish elks, plus a prehistoric skull of a European bison, also known as a Wisent on the North Sea bed. Carbon dating tests revealed that some of the bones belonged to a mammoth that roamed Doggerland - a former landmass in the southern North Sea that connected Great Britain to mainland Europe - around 40,000 years ago. ‘It is very difficult to tell the age with any accuracy, particularly just from a photograph, but there is no evidence to suggest it is Bronze Age.' The period stretches from 2,500BC to 800 BC. ‘It may well be that both antlers are Bronze Age - or both are older - it depends on what their estimation of the age was based upon, for example, if something is found with other objects that are more straightforward to date, such as tools,’ he added. The antlers and skull were discovered semi-submerged in the clay mud after being washed out by a high-tide. Carbon dating is the only way to know for sure exactly how old the antlers and skull are, but Dr Gelsthorpe said that due to the cost and length of the process, it may not be an option. He explained: ‘It is particularly difficult (to estimate) if something is found on a beach as it could have been washed in from anywhere and may not be the same age as the sediment where it was found. ‘There is only really one lab in the UK, based in Oxford, that undertakes this kind of dating. ‘It is quite expensive and takes many months, so is only undertaken for the most important finds. Carbon dating is the only way to know for sure exactly how old the antlers and skull is, but Dr Gelsthorpe said that due to the cost and length of the process, it may not be an option. Palaeontologists think the remains belong to a two-year-old red deer but its gender is unknown . ‘Unfortunately, I can’t promise that carbon dating would be done on this specimen.’ The first antler was found by Jamie Cassidy, who spotted what looked like a stick poking through the shingle at South Walney, two years ago. As he dug it out, he realised it was an ancient antler. ‘It was kind of sticking out of the stones. I started brushing the stones away and found it was an antler,’ he said. The antlers and skull were found semi-submerged in the clay mud after being washed out by a high-tide. This image shows a section of jaw that was sticking out of the clay .","Palaeontologists think the ancient bones belong to a two-year-old  red deer .

"Heroic: Gage Garmo met rap superstar Eminem on Sunday evening and sadly passed away on Monday . He has built a career on his angry me-against the world reputation, but Eminem showed his softer side when he visited a terminally ill Detroit teenager on Sunday. Dashing in on a flight from Atlanta to his hometown, Eminem arrived at the house of Gage Garmo around 5pm and the two sat down and spoke about their love of hip hop and the Detroit Lions. Tragically, Gage, who has been battling Osteosarcoma, a rare and aggressive form of bone cancer, passed away on Monday night, but his family praised Eminem for granting their son a special last wish. Gage's mother Tina, father, Ghais and his younger sister described the moment the two met as 'very special and very quiet at the same time.' The two spent two hours together and the rapper left just before 8pm as quietly as he arrived. 'It was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen,' said said Ingrid Todt of charity, Rainbow Connection, who arranged the meeting to the Detroit Free Press. 'The stars aligned, and Gage's wish came true.' Eminem requested only one condition of their meeting - that no media were present as he didn't want media swarming the Garmo household. According to the Detroit News, Eminem hid his car in the Garmo family's garage, but when the Rainbow Connection revealed the meeting afterwards on social media, word got out. Friends and classmates of the one-time high school footballer, had used social media to spread Gage's wish to meet 42-year-old Eminem, his musical hero, after he learned last week that he had just days left to live. Scroll Down for Video . Family: Gage with his father Ghais and mother Tina Garmo and his younger sister, during his three-year battle with cancer . They started the hashtag, #GetGageGarmoToMeetEminem and the rapper duly stepped up  to visit the sick teen, whose family live 20 minutes from the star's house. 'Gage sat up with a grin on his face,' said Todt. 'His family hadn't seen their son do that in such a long time.' Gage was diagnosed with bone cancer three years ago, when he was a freshman at Rochester High School. 'We're so glad we were able to reach Eminem's people and they were able to respond, and Eminem was able on such short notice to go and see this boy in his own home,' said Rainbow Connection director Mary Grace McCarter to the Detroit Free Press. 'It says something about everybody, really. I hope all the students and friends of Gage feel good about their well-wishes too.' Superstar: Eminem arrived at Gage's house amid tight secrecy and did not want the visit publicized beforehand . Bravery: Sports fan Gage poses with a big smile on his face alongside a girl from Hooters, while he stands side-by-side one of his heroes from the Detroit Lions . Tribute: When it became clear that Gage had only days left to live, his friends banded together to tell him what they thought . Remembrance: On Monday night after his death, Gage's friends held a candlight vigil for their brave friend . According to his GoFundMe page, Gage was diagnosed with cancer in his freshman year and battled it with multiple rounds of chemotherapy and surgery. He had his leg amputated last year and his cancer turned terminal when it passed to his lungs and began to shut down his body. Rochester Hills Mayor Bryan Barnett posted on Facebook, “A young life was taken from our community way too soon and it will never make sense. Our city mourns while sending our thoughts and prayers to the Garmo family.” “Gage’s legacy in this community is secure. His amazing friends made sure of that. Courageous, hero and fighter’ (are) all words he earned right up until his final moments.” Throughout his treatment and fight against cancer, Gage has become an inspiration for his Rochester Hills school classmates. 'Gage was probably my biggest inspiration this year,' said football player Blake Fetterhoff to Rochester Hills Patch. 'We have helmet stickers with our numbers on them (football helmets) and I put his number 32 under my number on my helmet. He probably got me through this season. I couldn’t see this season without him.'","Hip hop star rushed from Atlanta to Detroit to be with Gage Garmo .

"A modern day gold rush is taking place along the coast of a Russian town after a storm washed a small fortune in amber onto the beach. Amber is fossilized tree resin valued enormously for its colour and natural beauty since Neolithic times. It is treated as a gemstone and used in jewellery, but is also used as an ingredient in perfumes, and in traditional medicine. Although it can be found all over the world more than 90 percent of the world’s amber is found along the Samland coast in the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast region, sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. Scroll down for video . Dozens of people dived into the sea near the Russian town of Pionersky in Kaliningrad to search for amber . The resin was washed ashore during a storm in the Baltic which is home to 90 percent of the world's supply . Locals waded into the ocean with nets to scoop up any pieces of amber that have been washed up . Pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves, and collected by hand, dredging, or diving. The latest storm creating a huge crop of amber for locals who turned up with nets and diving suits to line their pockets with the gemstone from the shoreline in the town of Pionersky, in the Kaliningrad region. Most of them seemed not to be put off by the freezing cold conditions, some even putting on wetsuits and using huge nets to sweep the shoreline as waves washed over them. Others stayed onshore picking through blackened seaweed and rock pools. Local Olga Bazhenova, 42, interviewed on Russian TV said: 'Town residents and tourists were picking up small and medium-sized pieces of amber from seaweed and sand from dawn till dusk. It was a free for all, some people make themselves a lot of money to start the New Year.' She added: 'Even pensioners forgot their ailments and age and scratched the frozen soil with sticks like babies in a sandpit.' The timing could not have been better, as the 'free gift from nature' will help people out during the country’s current economic crisis, but also raise spirits in the region. The amber is a major source of income for the region with the local Kaliningrad Amber Factory extracting 250 tonnes of it in 2014. Amber comes from resin which oozed from ancient trees and formed into larger lumps which fossilised and hardened. In some cases the resin formed around an ancient insect, preserving it perfectly for millions of years. The resin is different to the sap found within a tree which acts as its vascular system. It is believed that most amber is between 30 and 90 million years old. Amber is most commonly used as a jewellery, but it is also used in perfumes. The substance has even been used as a building material in several 17th century churches. Some faith 'healers' believe that the fossil has certain restorative properties. Some scientists believe that it would be possible to extract DNA from creatures set in amber, possibly finding additional answers for questions about evolution. According to the Birmingham Assay Office, amber is very soft and warm to the touch and is easily scratched. It will melt if touched with a hot needle. Also, if you put alcohol on amber it should evaporate without leaving any sticky residue. The fossil also produces static electricity if it is rubbed with a soft cloth and will float in a strong saltwater solution. If you lick amber, it should not have any taste - unlike the plastic versions. Some of the more adventurous came equipped with snorkels and face masks to dive on the amber . Less intrepid people picked their way through the sand looking for any smaller bits of amber on the beach . Some larger pieces of amber were found in mud near the waterline by locals .","Dozens of Russians braved the freezing Baltic in a mad-cap treasure hunt .

"Families of two of the 20 first-graders killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting are suing the town of Newtown and its board of education, alleging security measures at the school allowed the attack to happen. The wrongful death lawsuit served on the town Friday is being filed by the parents of Jesse Lewis and Noah Pozner, who were among the children fatally shot December 14, 2012. The families are seeking unspecified damages in the lawsuit, which is expected to be filed in state Superior Court in Danbury in the coming weeks. Scroll down for video . Responsibility: The parents of Noah Pozner, (left) and Jesse Lewis (right) are suing the Newtown school board for the death's of their children in the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School . Terro: A Connecticut State Police officer runs with two woman and a student from Sandy Hook Elementary School. The women were evacuated after gunman Adam Lanza, 20, entered the building and fatally shot 20 children and six adults before taking his own life . Among the allegations is that Sandy Hook Elementary School had security policies and procedures in place that teachers weren't able to follow on the day of the killings. Classroom doors could only be locked from the outside with keys, leaving teachers vulnerable to intruders, and the front of the school didn't have security glass to protect against gunshots, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges a teacher in one of the two classrooms where students were killed was a substitute, didn't have a key and didn't receive training on the security protocols. 'We are hopeful that the town of Newtown's elected and hired representatives will work with these families, who have already suffered, and continue to suffer, unimaginable loss, to help resolve this matter in the most efficient and constructive way possible,' Donald Papcsy, a lawyer for Lewis and Pozner's parents, said in a statement. 'As residents of the town, we all either have, or are going to have, students in our Sandy Hook schools, and we promote the idea of learning from the past and protecting our children in the future.' Neil Heslin, of Newtown, Connecticut and Scarlett Lewis, the parents of Jesse Lewis, the Sandy Hook first grader shot and killed by Adam Lanza in December 2012 . Devastated: Veronique Pozner, mother of Noah Pozner, is escorted to her car in Fairfield, Connecticut on Monday, December 17, 2012 - at the funeral of her son . Town Attorney David Grogins said the town was served with the lawsuit Friday. He declined further comment. School board members did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday. The gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, shot his way into the front entrance of the school, which was locked at the time, and killed the 20 children and six teachers, then shot himself to death, state police said. Before going to the school, he killed his mother in their Newtown home, state police said. Last month, the families of nine of the slain victims filed a lawsuit in state court against the maker and sellers of the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle that Lanza used in the shooting, saying the gun should not have been sold for civilian use because of its overwhelming firepower. The killings prompted a fresh debate on gun rights and last month the families of nine victims sued the maker of the gun that was used, an AR-15 assault weapon manufactured by Bushmaster, saying it should not have been sold to civilians. Reports by state police and the state child advocate said Lanza's parents, educators and others missed signs of how deeply troubled he was and opportunities to steer him toward more appropriate treatment for his mental health problems. Lanza's obsessions with firearms, death and mass shootings have been documented by police files, and investigators previously concluded the motive for the shootings may never be known. Last month it was announced that the parents of 10 children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre have begun legal steps to sue the manufacturers of the AR-15 assault rifle Adam Lanza used to commit his December, 2012, massacre. Twenty first-graders were shot dead and six teachers during the shocking school shooting and 10 parents have filed court documents as of Monday indicating they plan to file wrongful death lawsuits. The filings were made in a probate court opening legal estates in their children's names and most of those parents checked a box on the forms saying they intend to file wrongful death actions, with themselves as administrators.","Lawsuit Filed by the parents of Jesse Lewis and Noah Pozner .

"These stunning pictures show you exactly what it's like to be ice-climbing while an avalanche crashes down a mountain. An adventure that few of us will ever experience first hand, photographer Jonathan Griffith, has captured the entire frightening, freezing ordeal. Through the falling snow, the brave climber clings on to the side of the icy mountain as it showers over him. Scroll down for video . Ever wondered what it's like to be stuck in an avalanche? These incredible photos depict an ice-climber's unfortunate experience in Italy . The ice climber was at 6,000ft in the Italian Alps near Cogne with alpine climbing photographer Jonathan Griffith . Thankfully, the ice climber, who is almost 6,000ft high, manages to hold on and safely makes it through. The spectacular pictures were taken by alpine climbing photographer, Jonathan Griffith, during a visit to the Alps near Cogne, Italy. The 31-year-old, from London, set up his camera on a tripod and used a radio control to take the pictures while supporting his friend Jeff Mercier's weight with a rope. Jonathan watched on as his daring pal took on the climb known as the 'hard ice on the rock,' already knowing that there would be an avalanche. Though the climber was almost 6 thousand feet high, he managed to hang on and make it safely through the snowfall .

Jonathan said: 'It was snowing when we arrived so we knew that avalanches would be coming down. 'Ice climbing is always quite risky, but the shots are nice as they are quite atmospheric. 'It was more like getting a very cold spray of ice and wind rather than anything life threatening. 'Of course that is totally dependent on the snow itself - in this case it fell as light powder so there is not much weight behind it. 'I actually set the camera up on a tripod and had a radio control.

"Labour councillor Anita Ward tweeted in support of the Je Suis Charlie marchers - but accidentally added added her support for the terrorists . A former Lord Mayor of Birmingham has apologised after accidentally tweeting a hashtag in support of the Charlie Hebdo killers. Labour councillor Anita Ward, who is also the Birmingham County Royal British Legion chairman, tweeted in support of the Je Suis Charlie marchers on Sunday - but then accidentally added her support for the  terrorists who killed 17 people in Paris last week. She wrote: 'Thoughts are in Paris with all those marching in unity for #JeSuisCharlie but don't foget #JeSuisKouachi #JeSuisAhmed & Others.' #JeSuisKouachi is being used on social media by people supporting the massacres. In a rush to upload the Tweet, Cllr Ward did not realise her mistake until she started receiving 'vile' replies on the social media site. An audibly upset Cllr Ward today told MailOnline: 'It was literally down to carelessness on my part. 'When I started typing #JeSuis suggestions automatically came up, and I accidentally pressed the wrong one - I didn't even realise what I had done it until I started getting some really vile tweets back. 'I apologised immediately. I couldn't believe it. If I could take it back and undo it, I would. 'All I can do is keep apologising, I wasn't paying attention and no one can beat me up more about that than me. It was a genuine, genuine mistake. 'I can take people criticising me, I deserve that. But some of the vileness, it's just been unnecessary. 'I've deleted my account, it was a stupid mistake. I've learnt my lesson and in future I won't be using it. 'It's been a tough couple of days.' Some took to the social media site and called for her immediate sacking, despite her immediate apology. One of the replies she received said: 'Just when you thought #Labour couldn't be more vile, they ask you to remember the poor terrorists killed in Paris...' The tweet (pictured) Councillor Ward sent before realising her mistake and deleting it and her account . In a rush to upload the Tweet, Cllr Ward did not realise her mistake until she started receiving 'vile' replies . Cllr Ward has repeatedly apologised for her use of the hashtag, but has been forced to delete her account . Cllr Ward is a staunch supporter of the British forces and is also Birmingham's official Veterans' Champion . She deleted the tweet almost immediately and apologised as she came under fire before deleting her account. Cllr Ward is a staunch supporter of the British forces and is also Birmingham's official Veterans' Champion. Her son was shot by the Taliban while serving with the Irish Guards in Afghanistan five years ago. Cllr Ward told the Birmingham Mail: 'I get it and I am sorry. Most of all to the families of those killed and to my son who was injured in Afghanistan fighting these type of people.' She told the paper her use of the hashtag was a genuine mistake in a moment of carelessness. #JeSuisAhmed is a tribute to Ahmed Merabet (pictured right) who was killed at point blank range by suspected Islamic fanatics, echoing the 'JeSuisCharlie' (I am Charlie) demonstrations across the world . 'I didn't even see them [the hashtags] come up,' she added. 'I obviously wasn't paying attention and have learned my lesson not to press 'send' in a rush. 'I apologise for any offence caused.' Some people took to Twitter to support Cllr Ward, and showed how auto-complete settings on Twitter throw up linked or similar phrases, with the #JeSuisCharlie message followed by #JeSuisKouachi and #JeSuisAhmed.

The celebration of Mr Merabet, who was killed at point blank range by suspected Islamic fanatics, echoes the 'JeSuisCharlie' (I am Charlie) demonstrations that have swept the world in the wake of last week's shocking massacre. The incident also comes after a Fox News pundit who claimed that Birmingham is closed to non-Muslims sparked a comic backlash as web users took to Twitter to mock the outlandish statement. The controversy originated when Mr Emerson, a self-styled expert on terrorism, was participating in a Fox News discussion in the wake of the attacks on Charlie Hebdo's office in Paris. 'In Britain, it's not just no-go zones,' he claimed. 'There are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply don't go in.' The pundit later apologised for his blunder - just 22 per cent of the city's residents are Muslim, compared to 46 per cent describing themselves as Christian - but could not stop the bemused reaction. Among those criticising Mr Emerson were Prime Minister David Cameron, who said yesterday: 'When I heard this, frankly I choked on my porridge. This guy is clearly a complete idiot.' #JeSuisAhmed has been used by thousands as way of paying tribute to Muslim police officer Mr Merabet .","Former Lord Mayor Anita Ward tweeted message of support to Paris .

"The Charlie Hebdo journalist spared death for being a woman has told how she stared into the gunman's 'soft, troubled' eyes so he wouldn't spot a male colleague crouched under a desk. Sigolène Vinson spoke vividly of her ordeal at the hands of the the Kouachi brothers, giving the fullest account yet of the Paris massacre which claimed 12 lives. The 40-year-old legal affairs commentator was in an editorial meeting, chatting to colleagues as they made coffee, when they heard a 'pop pop' sound she took to be a firecracker last Wednesday. Horror: Sigolène Vinson (left), who was spared during the slaughter in the offices of Charlie Hebdo (right), has spoken vividly of her survival in the fullest account yet of the Paris massacre which killed 12 people . Mascot: As Charlie Hebdo's 'house' dog, Lila the Cocker Spaniel was in the office when the killings began. Ms Vinson told Le Monde she could remember the pattering of Lila's paws as she moved between the bodies . The noise was Said and Cherif Kouachi's first round of gunfire, which hit the magazine's webmaster Simon Fieschi in the shoulder and left him in a coma. Dressed like guerillas or special forces, with full face masks and body armour, the brothers burst into the newsroom shouting 'Allahu akbar' and murdered her colleagues one by one. When one of the brothers came to Ms Vinson, he spared her life because she was a woman. Amid the horror, she was fixed by his 'soft, black' eyes. And she did her utmost to hold the killer's gaze so he would not assassinate her colleague Jean-Luc, the magazine's layout artist. 'I looked at him,' she told Le Monde. 'He had these big, black eyes, and a very soft gaze. I felt a moment of trouble in him, like he was looking for my name. 'My brain was working fine. I thought quickly. I understood that he had not seen Jean-Luc, who was in his office. Killers: Cherif (left) and Said Kouachi spared the life of Sigolène Vinson, but told her to read the Koran . Triumphant: One of the brothers was caught on video chanting: 'We have avenged the Prophet Muhammad' 'He said: ""Don't be afraid. calm down. I'm not going to kill you. You are a woman. We don't kill women. '""But think about what you are doing. What you are doing is bad. I am sparing you, and because I am sparing you, you will read the Koran."" 'I gave him a sign of the head - to make a connection, to make contact. 'I don't want to break eye contact because Jean-Luc is under the table, and he hasn't seen him, and I've understood that if they don't kill the women, they will kill the men.' Jean-Luc survived the attack. The terrorists' claims that they never kill women was simply untrue. While the Kouachi brothers were on the run, a policewoman was shot dead in an attack linked to the pair. And in the office itself, they killed Elsa Cayat, a 54-year-old Jewish psychoanalyst and author who specialised in issues of gender and sexuality, and wrote a fortnightly column for Charlie Hebdo. In the wide-ranging interview with Le Monde, Ms Vinson said it felt 'unfair' that the gunman had told her not to be afraid, seconds after pointing his weapon at her head. And she told how the magazine's mascot, Lila the Cocker Spaniel, pattered her paws between her owners' bodies as the carnage unfolded. Murdered: The victims in 2000. Circled top (left to right) are Philippe Honore, Georges Wolinski, Bernard Maris and Jean Cabut. Below them are editor Stephane Charbonnier (left) and cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac . The scene was a 'vision of horror', she said. When the gunmen left, the first thing Ms Vinson saw in the newsroom was her colleague Philippe Lancon. He survived, but he had been shot in the right cheek. The flesh was torn. She told him not to talk, but felt unable to help him or approach him. She was immobilised by shock. Near him were two colleagues, clearly dead. Ms Vinson called the fire department, and the operator asked how many bodies she could see. 'They're all dead. They're all dead. They're all dead,' she replied. The brothers had left, killing a Muslim policeman in cold blood as they did, and led police on a two-day manhunt before they were killed in a siege near the city's Charles de Gaulle Airport. Emotional: Charlie Hebdo's new editor Gerard Biard (left), and journalist Patrick Pelloux (right) yesterday comforting cartoonist Luz (centre), who avoided the attack because he was half an hour late for work . 'We are cartoonists and we like drawing little characters, just as we were as children': Charlie Hebdo caricaturist Renald 'Luz' Luzier reacts during a press conference about the newspaper's next edition . As Ms Vinson tended to the victims, the cartoonist Luz arrived late with a cake. It was his birthday. Because he survived, it fell to him to create a cover for the first edition of the magazine since the shooting. Due for release today, its 3million copies feature an image of the Prophet Muhammad holding a sign which says 'Je Suis Charlie' and declares: 'All is forgiven'. Breaking down in tears at a press conference yesterday, he said: 'We are cartoonists and we like drawing little characters, just as we were as children. 'The terrorists, they were kids, they drew just like we did, just like all children do. 'At one point, they lost their sense of humour. At one point, they lost the soul of their child which allowed them to look at the world with a certain distance.'","Sigolène Vinson, 40, gave vivid and emotional account of Paris massacre .

"Everybody likes a friendly welcome on their first day in a new job, but this greeting may have crossed the line. Brian Barczyk was the subject of some unwanted attention as he tried to tried to clean out the pen of four-year-old llama-alpaca hybrid Misty. Barczyk was chased by the apparently bad-tempered animal, before being mounted several times - and it was all caught on camera. Zoo volunteer Brian Barcyzk was given what appeared to be a very friendly welcome by llama Misty on his first day at work . But the four-year-old llama's attentions were a little too much for Barcyzk . Misty also chased Barczyk around her pen - which he had been hoping to help clean . Eventually, the television producer was forced to jump the fence to escape . Barczyk, who works as a producer for Animal Bytes TV, was volunteering for the first time at the Tri-State Zoological Park in Maryland. On a video of the incident, he can be heard telling a zookeeper cleaning out the pen of the petting zoo animal seems 'like a pretty easy job'. Little did he know what was about to happen. The video shows Misty chasing and trying to mount the volunteer as he tries to sweep up. Eventually, it all gets a bit too much for Barcyzk, who is forced to leap over a fence in a desperate bid to escape her attentions. The attack came as a shock to Barcyzk, who said he'd been expecting a warmer welcome from the furry animal - especially considering he is more used to working with snakes. After all, llamas aren't known for their aggressive tendencies. 'Misty looked so cute, I was excited to get in her enclosure and clean up,' Barcyzk said. Barcyzk said afterwards he had been expecting a warmer welcome as she looked 'so cute' He had also thought that llamas were tame - a myth Misty helped dispel . 'I had no idea she was so upset as I had always heard that llamas were tame. 'But she certainly dispelled that myth and chased me out of the pen.' Tri-State Zoological Park is a non-profit facility that houses mainly exotic animals that are in need of a home. These include lions, tigers, birds, reptiles and primates. Whether or not Barcyzk has returned to the pen since is not known .","Brian Barcyzk was chased and jumped on after he entered llama's pen .

"The San Francisco man accused of running a $200million online drug empire called the Silk Road has admitted he founded the web site - but denies that he trafficked in narcotics or made a fortune off its creation. Prosecutors on Tuesday claimed Ross William Ulbricht made $18million in bitcoins by enabling drug dealers to operate anonymously on his website. Ulbricht was 'left holding the bag' by operators of the Silk Road website after they were alerted that federal investigators were closing in, defense attorney Joshua Dratel said in his opening statement at Ulbricht's criminal trial. On trial: A courtroom drawing showing Ross William Ulbrich listening during the opening arguments in his trial in New York. Ulbricht's lawyer admitted that he 'did invent the Silk Road' but handed it over to others. For the first time, Ulbricht's lawyer admitted that he 'did invent the Silk Road' but that he handed it off to others after just a few months when the business proved to be 'too stressful.' Drug kingpin or innocent founder? For the first time ever Ross Ulbricht confessed to starting the Silk Road website but says he did not make $18 million off of it - and instead handed off control month after the site's creation . Standing by his innocence: Supporters of Ross William Ulbricht hold signs during the jury selection for his trial outside of federal court in New York on Tuesday . Supporters of Ross Ulbricht, the alleged creator and operator of the Silk Road underground market, protested his capture at Manhattan federal court house on the first day of jury selection for his trial . Ulbricht's defense also said that had he made $18 million that he wouldn't have been living as poorly as he does, reports The Daily Dot. 'Ross is not a drug dealer. Ross is not a kingpin. Ross is not involved in a conspiracy,' Dratel said. The 30-year-old has pleaded not guilty to charges of narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering. Minutes earlier, Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Howard described Ulbricht as all of those things and more, calling him a kingpin who created a website where 'anybody anywhere in the world could buy and sell dangerous drugs with a click of a mouse.' Howard said it was 'as quick and easy as ordinary online shopping.' About a dozen protesters stood in front of the courthouse for part of the day with signs and jury nullification fliers in support of Ulbricht. After the trial finished for the day, Judge Katherine Forrest said she would consider establishing an anonymous jury to protect them if the protests persisted. Dratel said: 'People think they're helping the defense by being out there. They're not.' Claims innocence: Ross William Ulbricht was 'left holding the bag' by operators of the Silk Road website after they were alerted that federal investigators were closing in, defense attorney Joshua Dratel said on Tuesday . Strong support: Supporters of Ross William Ulbricht hold signs during the jury selection for his trial outside of federal court in New York on Tuesday . In his opening, Howard said Ulbricht made $18 million in bitcoins by enabling drug dealers to earn over $200 million through more than a million drug sales after the website was activated in 2011 until it was shut down by the government in October 2013. Howard said 95 percent of items sold on Silk Road were illegal drugs, though the site also featured fake passports and tools to hack into computers and email accounts. 'This is a case about a dark secret part of the Internet that was home to an enormous marketplace for the sale of illegal drugs,' he said. The prosecutor said Ulbricht operated 'like a traditional drug boss,' setting rules for thousands of drug dealers who catered to customers who could 'pick their drug of choice and have it delivered right to their doorstep.' Protester support: Rodd Ulbricht, who has pleaded not guilty, is accused by the US government of making millions of dollars from the Silk Road website which sold drugs and other illegal commodities anonymously . Standing by: Max Dickstein stands with other upporters of Ross Ulbricht, the alleged creator and operator of the Silk Road underground market, in front of a Manhattan federal court house on the first day of jury selection . Howard said Ulbricht was willing to use threats and violence to protect his turf. He alluded to murders-for-hire that Dratel dismissed as plots in which there was 'no evidence the people involved ever existed.'Ulbricht also is charged in Baltimore federal court in an attempted murder scheme. Ulbricht disputes he operated online under the alias 'Dread Pirate Roberts,' a reference to a swashbuckling character in 'The Princess Bride.' But Howard said Ulbricht was 'caught red handed' in a public library in San Francisco on the day he was arrested, talking online as 'Dread Pirate Roberts' with an undercover FBI agent who had infiltrated the website as a trusted member of its support staff. He said trial witnesses would include a computer programmer who provided Ulbricht advice in 2010 and 2011. The prosecutor said Ulbricht confessed he was running a website that sold illegal drugs and 'bragged that he was the mastermind.' Dratel said Ulbricht created Silk Road as 'an economic experiment' but handed it off to others after a few months because it was 'too stressful for him.' He said Ulbricht was lured back to be 'in that library that day to take the fall for the people operating the website.'

"They are some of the most mysterious objects in our galaxy and have baffled astronomers for years. Now scientists have produced a new detailed map that they hope will help to unravel what is floating in the space between the stars and absorbing some of the light they produce. It had long been assumed that there was little sitting in the vacuum that exists between the billions of stars in the Milky Way. Scroll down for interactive graphic and video . The pattern of mysterious molecules in relation to the stars and dust of the Milky Way is shown in the graphic above.  Red shows the greatest concentrations of these molecules in the dustiest areas of our galaxy while blue denotes the lowest concentrations on the fringes . However, astronomers began to notice that the light coming from some of the stars in the Milky Way was being interfered with to produce distinct lines. These became known as 'Diffuse Interstellar Bands' and are thought to be caused by the absorption of light by molecules floating around in the space between the stars. Some have speculated that this 'interstellar medium' was composed of unusual rings of complex hydrocarbons and other large carbon-based molecules, but it has never been proved. 'Diffuse interstellar bands' or Dibs are dark lines in space that hide in the light. Analysing rainbow-colour bands of starlight that have passed through space gives astronomers important information about the make-up of the space materials that the light has encountered. But in 1922, the  photographs of this light from the stars yielded some dark lines, indicating that some starlight was 'missing'' and that something in the interstellar medium between Earth and the star was absorbing the light. Since then, scientists have identified more than 400 of these diffuse interstellar bands, but the materials that cause the bands to appear and their precise location have remained a mystery. Researchers speculate that the absorption of starlight that creates these dark bands points to the presence of unusually large complex molecules, but proof of this has remained elusive. The nature of this puzzling material is important to astronomers because it could provide clues about the physical conditions and chemistry of these regions between stars. Such details serve as critical components in theories as to how stars and galaxies formed. Now two teams at the John Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland, have created a map that shows where these enigmatic molecules can be found in relation to the stars. 'These results will guide researchers toward the best observations and laboratory experiments to pin down the properties and nature of these enigmatic molecules,' said Ting-Wen Lan, who led one of the teams that compiled the map. The interactive map above was produced by the team at John Hopkins University and allows the location of diffuse interstellar bands to be shown alongside the stars in the Milky Way or other features such as interstellar dust by dragging the bar in the top right corner or using the up or down cursor on your keyboard . The researchers created the map using huge volumes of data obtained during extensive surveys of the night's sky, such as from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. One group focused on the densest parts of the Milky Way using infrared observations that can cut through the dust clouds that obscure many of the stars there. The other group analysed the visible light from half a million stars, galaxies and quasars located on the fringes of our galaxy. Here the diffuse interstellar bands are harder to detect, but the researchers were able to see patterns in the type of environments where they are more likely to come from. The light from the Milky Way, shown above, is concentrated along a plane and this is where most diffuse interstellar bands are detected . The researchers also looked at the interstellar dust that exists to see if this could provide clues about what the mystery molecules are . While molecules that absorb light in one way tended to be found in the densest regions of gas and dust, others were found in lonelier spots far away from stars. This suggests that rather than being a random jumble of different molecules, the molecules in interstellar space are more organised than previously thought. The team also found mysterious features in front of around 60,000 stars and were able to measure the motion of some of these. The resulting map allows the location of the diffuse interstellar band to be seen alongside the Milky Way's stars and also shows where concentrations of molecules such as hydrogen, . Gail Zasowski, who led the second team that helped compile the map, said: 'For the first time, we can see how these mysterious molecules are moving around the galaxy. 'This is extremely useful and brings in new connections between these molecules and the dynamics of the Milky Way.' Diffuse interstellar bands were first detected in 1922 by astronomer Mary Lea Heger at the Lick Observatory, in California. While analyzing the light from stars, she found unexpected lines that were created by something existing in the interstellar space between the stars and the Earth. Professor Brice Ménard, who oversaw the project at the department of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University, said that while the map gave the most complete view so far of where the molecules that cause diffuse interstellar bands can be found, it was far from complete. He said: 'Our galaxy is made of the following ingredients - atoms, small molecules, large​ molecules, grains/rocks and stars. 'Over the past 30 years, astronomers were able to create maps for each of these constituents but not for the large molecules. They are much more difficult to detect. These molecules are mysterious in the sense that we can see their fingerprints in the light from stars but we cannot identify exactly which molecules they are. We only know they are large molecules. 'Many generations of astronomers and physicists have tried to address this question but so far nobody has succeeded. ​This map is a new piece to the puzzle. We cannot yet identified the nature of the molecules but we are getting one step closer. 'We have developed new analysis techniques and made use of the largest spectroscopic dataset available to create a new large-scale map of these mysterious molecules. We can now make an image and ""see"" where they are in the sky and therefore where they are in the Milky Way. 'We can also see in which direction and how fast they are moving.'","Map provides the most detailed look yet at where strange molecules that absorb light from the stars can be found .
These molecules create what are known as Diffuse Interstellar Bands in the spectrum of light emitted by stars .
Astronomers analysed the light from 560,000 stars, galaxies and quasars to search for Diffuse Interstellar Bands .
The molecules causing these bands are thought to be large and complex hydrocarbons but remain a mystery .

"Police should be allowed to catch 40 winks while on duty – and given special 'sleep pods' where they can nod off, say experts. Work time 'sleep breaks' could help reduce fatigue and promote better concentration, according to researchers. Instead of reaching for high sugar, high carb foods to maintain alertness, officers on night shifts could take brief power naps in pods like those used by multinational firms like Google. Researchers say that police officers should be allowed to take sleep breaks to help reduce fatigue and promote better concentration (file picture) Thousands of police from six forces are taking part in an 'officer wellbeing' study commissioned by the Police Federation into the benefits of dozing at work. Study leader Marcus de Guingand, who runs the 'fatigue management' firm Third Pillar of Health, said the results of his study – due to be published later this year – would recommend 'power naps'. He said: 'There appears to be a caffeine culture among police officers – they use counter-measures to maintain their alertness. People working the night shift are a lot more likely to reach for high sugar, high carb foods to give them the quick lift they need. 'All that has a significant effect on health and performance. Together with increased workloads as a result of widespread budget cuts there appears to be rising levels of stress as well as absence.' He added: 'I would suggest that where there is the ability to set up a room with appropriate furniture (beds or sleep pods), that would be a very appropriate strategy.' Mr de Guingand said Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill both 'napped' during the day and that a 'siesta culture' was important for a person's wellbeing. Senior police, however, have said the idea would be 'unworkable' and that the public would expect officers to be wide awake while on duty. Although there is no 'official' ban on officers snoozing on duty, it is widely discouraged among the workforce. One inspector at Sussex Police, who asked not to be named, said: 'If someone is murdered and it comes out that half the response officers on duty at the time were asleep it would obviously not look good for us.' Irene Curtis, president of the Police Superintendents' Association, said officers do need to be in a 'position to respond'. Study leader Marcus de Guingand suggested officers on night shifts could take brief power naps in pods similar to those used by Google (file picture) She explained: 'I'm not aware of any prohibition on napping but the reality is officers do need to be in a position to respond. 'I am conscious officer wellbeing needs to be on the agenda of all forces in the future as numbers are reduced and officers are being asked to do more.' Meanwhile Will Eastwood, of the North Yorkshire Police Federation, added: 'We hope that this study will go some way to assisting our officers and organisations in improving the management of fatigue in the future. 'The potential benefits of this being firstly an assessment that will make instant recommendations, often small changes that will improve quality of life, and secondly the collection of data which will enable analysis of what makes the most impact on officer fatigue. 'We have since been joined in the study by several other services, including, Sussex, Thames Valley and South Yorkshire; their participation will strengthen the quality of data gathered and is a great boost.' A spokesman for the College of Policing said it was acting to reduce fatigue by working with occupational health, welfare and safety experts in individual forces. The study will be discussed by police chiefs later this year, with a view to piloting the scheme in several forces.","Experts say officers should be given 'sleep pods' so they can take naps .

"Rapper Snoop Dogg has been revealed as the most prolific celebrity user of photo sharing app Instagram. According to data compiled by addiction website Addiction-Treatment.com, the 43-year-old has posted more images than any other famous person currently using the app, including selfie queens Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton. But Snoop - whose real name is Cordozar Broadus, Jr. - was also revealed to have posted more references to drugs and alcohol than any other celebrity, with fellow rapper P. Diddy coming a close second. Scroll down for video . The ultimate Instagrammer: Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Cordozar Broadus, Jr., was named as the most active celebrity Instagram user . Raise your glass! P. Diddy was also featured in the top five most active Instagram users, as well as being named as one of the top celebrities most likely to post about drink or drugs . Number one: Addiction-Treatment.com compiled a list of the most active celebrity Instagram users . The date, which was compiled in September 2014, shows that Snoop had posted a total of 686 images which contained a reference to illegal substances or drink - making up just over seven per cent of his Instagram activity - while P. Diddy, whose ream name is Sean Combs, had posted 347. Indeed, it seems rappers in general have a particular fondness for the photo sharing; of the 40 celebrities included on the list of most active users, a whopping 27 were rappers, while just six actors or actresses, four models and three comedians were also included. But when ranked according to number of illicit images shared on the site, rappers, including Nicki Minaj and Drake, made up the top 15 spots on the list. Setting an example for his fellow rappers however, is Jay-Z, who has posted just one image which contained . Surprisingly, the Kardashian clan, who are renowned for their seemingly-constant Instagram updates, featured fairly far down on the list, with Khloe, Kim and their younger sister Kendall Jenner placing ninth, tenth and eleventh respectively. Illicit images: The website also revealed which celebrities post the most references to drugs and alcohol . Risky rappers: Of all the users revealed to have posted the most illicit images, the majority were rappers . But when it came to the more illicit Instagram updates, the reality stars will no doubt be happy to hear that they fell even further down the list. According to Addiction Treatment, both Kim and Khloe have posted a total of 21 photos which contained references to drugs or alcohol, while Kendall - who is only 19 and therefore not yet legal to drink in the United States - has posted ten. The data does show that the number of celebrities posting images which contain references to drugs - and the frequency with which they have posted them - has decreased significantly since 2011, when the site became available to all members of the public. However the number of images containing references to alcohol has increased substantially. 'We can see the growth and decline of celebrity Instagram shares of drugs and alcohol images each month since 2011,' the website states. Strike a pose: Surprisingly selfie queens Kim (L) and Khloe Kardahsian (R) featured fairly far down on the list . The perfect pout: Kendall Jenner also featured on the list, just below her older sisters . 'It’s clear that sharing drugs has decreased significantly as the social media platform has become more prominent, but sharing alcohol posts has risen as the site’s popularity has surged.' The website also questions whether celebrities' eagerness to post such mature content is having a direct impact on the number of their fans who turn to drinking and drug use in an attempt to follow in their famous idols' footsteps. 'As Instagram has grown more popular, so has its popularity with celebrities, some of whom use social media to candidly and directly interact with fans,' the website explains. 'When drug use comes into the equation, we have to wonder what kind of message is being sent. Are celebrities promoting drug and alcohol abuse? If Snoop’s lighting up right now, why don’t I?'","A list of the most frequent picture posters was compiled by addiction website Addiction Treatment .

"Bizarre world: AK-47s were in the marital home of Amedy Coulibaly and Hayat Boumeddiene . AK-47s and ammunition were stacked neatly by the laundry basket at the home of France’s most wanted woman and her kosher deli killer husband when police raided four years ago, it has emerged. An extraordinary series of police interviews lay bare the bizarre marriage of terrorist Amedy Coulibaly and his wife Hayat Boumeddiene. They also reveal Boumeddiene, who is the fugitive suspected of helping mastermind the Paris attacks, had a sister living in Britain. Boumeddiene was quizzed by police in 2010 after they found ammunition for deadly assault rifles ‘piled neatly’ next to a washing basket in her flat. She told the interviewers she did not leave the house because she hated the ‘aggressive looks’ she got for wearing her veil. She also called for sharia law to be implemented across the world, branded Israel ‘disgusting’ and spoke of her brothers and sisters, including one called Mimouna who lived in England. It is not known whether she is still here. It is the second British link to the atrocities to emerge. The Paris terrorists were allegedly mentored by Djamel Beghal, 50, a former lieutenant of the notorious imam Abu Hamza. Beghal’s wife Sylvie, 45, a French citizen, lives in Leicester with her four children. Officers in 2010 found ‘large quantities’ of ammunition for Kalashnikovs and AK47s along with a machine for counting money, police records reveal, all neatly stacked next to a laundry basket in Boumeddiene's and Coulibaly's flat near Paris. Over four days, she was asked her views on terror attacks, her husband’s friends, their relationship, her mobile phone contracts, internet use and income and whether she had access to weapons. However, the brunette of Algerian origin was later released. She fled to Turkey before last week's attacks in which her husband murdered four Jewish people and has now crossed into Syria. The 26-year-old, who was photographed shooting a crossbow in her burkha, is suspected of importing automatic weapons from eastern Europe to France to be used in the attacks that left a total of 17 people dead last week. Relationship: The new details have emerged in interviews of Boumeddiene (right) in 2010 by police, who were told she and her husband Coulibaly (left) had fought over his desire to take a second wife . Mugshots: Police photos of Boumeddiene, who has fled abroad, and her husband, who was killed by police . She told interrogators in 2010: ‘I know everything my husband says is good for me. I trust him completely'. But the marriage almost broke down when her husband, who had the unlikely nickname of ‘Dolly’ among his friends, said he wanted a second wife, she explained. Couibaly, who belonged to the same radical Islamist gang as the Kouachi brother gunmen responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre, had asked close friend Cherif Kouachi to find him a second wife. The couple had a 'simple fight' about his wishes for a second bride and then put the issue behind them, she told police. The incredible details emerged in series of interviews of Boumeddiene over four days in 2010 after Coulibaly was arrested by counter-terrorism police on suspicion of having taken part in a plot to aid the prison escape of Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem. He received a prison sentence and is reported to have been released from prison just over a year ago. Boumeddiene was born in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-sur-Marne into a family of seven on June 26, 1988. She has two brothers and three sisters, one of whom was living at the time in England, Hayat told police during the interviews. Her mother died when she was just six years old and her delivery driver father Mohamed is believed to have struggled to raise the children on his own. Aggression: Footage has emerged of Boumeddiene wielding a crossbow, raising questions over her release . Message: This video of Coulibaly was released after he killed four in a siege at a kosher deli in Paris . ‘I was put into care when I was 12 years old because I could not accept my mother’s death and the quick remarriage of my dad,’ Boumeddiene told police. She was moved from foster come to foster home because she by her own admission ‘was often getting into fights’. It has now emerged that the troubled teenager spent time living on the streets and had a criminal record from age 13 when she fought with a social worker and a policewoman. Acknowledging her troubled past, she said that finding Islam had helped her to find stability and had given her ‘answers’. She described herself as ‘a practicing Sunni' and told the anti-terror police: 'I had the idea to go back to my origins. I bought books in Paris. I read a lot and realized that all my past was an error. On the run: CCTV images of Hayat Boumeddiene on January 2 at Istanbul Airport, on her way to Syria . She added: ‘I have had a difficult past and this religion answers all my questions and calms me. 'Since then I have tried to practice religion the best I can and it helps me find my wellbeing.' She said she had begun wearing the veil in 2009 after leaving a job at a supermarket where she was not allowed to wear it. She then took a job at a call centre. Pictures that have emerged of her in a bikini in the Dominican Republic in 2008 predate her commitment to Islam, she explained. ‘At the time I was not a practicing Muslim...Today I don’t wear it any more unless it’s just women there', she told her captors. But the interviews show how far the burkha-clad jihadi had already come from that girl in a bikini. The Islamist radical told police she thought that Sharia law should be implemented world wide and said that she believed the 9/11 killings might have been carried out by the US government. She said: ‘Sharia is the law of god, so I think that it would be best if it was applied.’ She refused to condemn Al Qaeda attacks but said she wanted to get involved in humanitarian efforts. ‘For me the war is to be condemned but when Americans, for example, kill innocent people it’s obviously justifiable that men take up arms to defend their women and children,’ she said. Asked her opinion on the conflict between Israel and Palestine, she replied: ‘The UN gave the Jews that land because of the hell they went through with Hitler and everything. ‘But considering that the Jews who have grown up in their state have not respected the rights of the Palestinians, excuse my expression, but it is disgusting.’ But she claimed that she did not believe in jihad as she did ‘believe that today's jihads are really authorised by God’. The couple’s relationship emerges as unbalanced with Coulibaly controlling and rigid. 'I stay at home,’ she told her interrogators. ‘I don’t go out except to do the shopping’. Battle: This was the moment police stormed the kosher deli where Coulibaly was holding survivors hostage . Unity: More than 3million people took to the streets of French cities including Paris to show their solidarity . Her husband told her nothing of his affairs, she claimed, and she did not even know his friends' names as she has to stay in her room when they visit. Coulibaly had no close friends since his best friend Ali was shot while running away from police in 2000, she claimed. But the couple did spend time with Cherif Kouachi and his wife, 'as a four', she said. Coulibaly went to the suspected terror camp at the home of an Al Qaeda kingpin known as Abou Hamza in central France every third week, sometimes accompanied by Cherif, she said. She herself went just twice 'to go hiking' she claimed and she there learnt to fire a crossbow. But the conversation revolved simply around ‘sport, the fresh air and countryside’, she told police. But investigators' phone taps mentioned in the interrogation suggest the bikini-babe turned burkha wearing extremist knew more than she let on. Police questioned her about a call in which husband asked her to ‘put aside 1000 euro for the brothers’. But Boumeddiene claimed she thought he mean her to put away some money for Palestinian children. ‘I give immediately if I see someone is in need' she said.","Hayat Boumeddiene told police she had sister, Mimouna, in 2010  interview .

But if you would rather not hear voices from beyond the grave, stick to roast dinners, smoked fish and red meat. Cara, from Bury, Lancashire - who goes by the name Psychic Cara - and who claims her clients include Les Dennis and Michelle Collins, believes a healthy diet can bring a healthy mind.

The psychic claims good foods for helping expand the mind to another realm include watercress, steamed fish, vegetables and avocado. She said: 'Food - not only necessary to keep us alive - can lift one's intelligence and enhance the memory and promote learning power.' According to Psychic Cara, roast dinners, smoked fish, red meat, pastry, cakes, and too much saturated fat and sugar are not just bad for the waistline. 'I imagine a huge Yorkshire pudding, slices of succulent beef, various veg and luscious steaming gravy, and a nice red wine are fantastic this time of year.

'The brains ability to make high levels of specific neurotransmitters, depends on the amount of certain nutrients circulating in the blood - hence the brain is affected by what we eat. 'One of the most important neurotransmitters for memory and learning is acetylcholine. The brain makes it from the B vitamin known as choline which is found in lecithin. 'Choline has been proven to boost memory within 90 minutes and improve the mood. Use if before an important meeting or exam. 'A psychic needs a lot of energy to communicate with 'Spirit' - hence diet is very important.'

"The U.S television show Homeland may not feature a Muslim storyline in its next season, it has been revealed. A new threat could be chosen in the fifth season ‘for creative reasons’ – and not because of the deadly attack on the headquarters of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris last week. Each of the first four seasons of Homeland have featured fictional Middle East terrorists and Muslim extremists. The U.S television show Homeland starring Claire Danes (pictured) may not feature a Muslim storyline in its next season, it has been revealed . But producers are considering moving away from the format and finding a new target for CIA case officer Carrie Mathison - played by Claire Danes - when the show makes a return to screens later this year. According to insidetv, the attacks in France last week will not play a part in deciding who the story’s next villain will be and will not prevent producers from tackling sensitive issues. Seventeen people, including journalists and police, were killed in three days of violence that began last Wednesday when militants burst into Charlie Hebdo's office during a regular editorial meeting and shot dead five of its leading cartoonists. David Nevins, the president of Homeland’s TV network Showtime, is reported by insidetv as saying: ‘I hope [the attacks are] not considered at all. ‘I really, really don’t want there to be any limitations. I don’t expect there will be. They never shied away from anything difficult. I want them to go right into the teeth of it again.’ Speaking at the Television Critics Association’s semi-annual press tour he said producer Alex Gansa would ‘not necessarily’ stay with addressing U.S. relations in the Muslim world. A new threat could be chosen in the fifth season ‘for creative reasons’ – and not because of the deadly attack on the headquarters of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris last week . He said no final decisions had yet been made and that writers may still opt to focus on the Middle East. In December, the Pakistani government hit out at producers of the Emmy-winning show over the portrayal of the country as a safe haven for Islamic terrorists. Diplomats condemned Homeland for depicting Islamabad, the setting of the show's fourth series, as a refuge for the Taliban with one official describing it as a 'disservice to the people of the US'. The fourth series of the popular show sees star Claire Danes portraying a member of the Central Intelligence Agency serving in Islamabad. Filmed in fact in Cape Town, the first episode sees a violent mob of local people beating another agent to death over a drone strike which killed a wanted terrorist hiding in a rural farmhouse. But Mr Nevins said this week: 'Some of the other sides [to Pakistan] the show brought up I think are also very defensible … It’s a very well researched show.' He added that the show was a work of fiction and that he was 'very defensive' of the rights of producers to 'tell difficult stories in difficult parts of the world.'","Producers may choose new threat for fifth season of U.S. show, Homeland .

"A romantic proposal is enough to leave anyone feeling breathless - especially if, like these couples, you're entirely submerged in water. These beautiful images feature spouses-to-be embracing in a crystal clear pool,  posing in evening gowns and black tie  to announce they're tying the knot in an inventive alternative to the traditional engagement picture. They are the work of US underwater photographer Adam Opris from Florida, who said: 'The year 2015 is bringing in so many new trends that are innovative, fun, and unique. One of those new trends that I am starting with my clients is an underwater engagement shoot.' Scroll down for video . Florida-based photographer Adam Opris shoots artistic pictures of couples underwater in an alternative to the traditional engagement photo . Adam Opris's photography has seen him use various challenging props such as a bunch of red balloons under the water . 'My couples are diving into the new year to express themselves and immortalise their love in a whole new medium.' Adam, who also creates ethereal underwater portraits of pregnant women, will help bring the couples' engagement visions to life. He said: 'Whether my clients are into high-end fashion with Louis Vuitton’s, the exciting world of Harry Potter or even a Steampunk lifestyle, we are creating art on a whole new level to celebrate their uniqueness and engagement.' In one mesmerising photo, a woman in a white dress looks like she's floating through the sky as she holds a bunch of red balloons as sunlight penetrates the water and breaks through a mass of fluffy white clouds. Many duos have worn their smartest outifts - the men in suits, the women in brightly coloured long gowns, that billow in the water - to be photographed sharing  a tender kiss, their hair streaming out behind them. Adam said: 'Every couple that comes to me looking for something different and unique always has a story. I love bringing each person’s character into the photo shoot and letting them show me what makes them unique as a couple. Most couples wear their finest clothes, like this bride-to-be in flowing red gown and strappy gold heels and her fiance who wears a tuxedo . Opris allows each couple to express their characters through their photographs with each of his images seeing a unique and personal theme . 'By putting them into the water, there are so many fun things we can do with the near weightless environment that would not be possible in a standard engagement shoot.' This is shown to best advantage in the snaps of couples floating in the water, swimming towards each other, or one man holding his apparently feather-light fiancée on his knee. The photographer, from Fort Lauderdale, has always had a passion for water and says: 'I’ve practically lived in the ocean my whole life. I am an adrenaline junkie who loves to travel.' Opris's images vary from the very romantic to the comical depending on the couple's style, this pair chose a morning routine as their theme . Opris said he can create a far greater variety of fun images in this near weightless environment than with a standard engagement shoot . Although most couples choose to buy outfits specifically for the shoot Opris says some have worn designer pieces from Prada and Armani . Opris says he was taught the tricks of the trade by a world-renowned fashion photographer. 'I have traveled all over the world photographing the beauty in people, places, and animals everywhere I could,' he said. Despite the underwater setting Opris says that his photo shoots see some couples dressed to the nines to perfect their engagement pictures. 'Most couples do not wear their best clothes but actually buy clothing for the shoot. I do have some couples that have shot in very high end fashion such as Prada or Armani. 'As long as the clothes are dry-cleaned they do not get ruined.' A beaming woman in a cobalt blue dress seems to fly down to her fiance, lying at the bottom of the pool filled with crystal clear water . The photographer has dealt with several different themes, including this Steampunk couple who added  Victorian elements to their shoot . Other couples have been even more inventive incorporating their favourite films, such as Harry Potter into the final image . Opris recommended that women only wear minimal make-up to be photographed underwater such as waterproof mascara and lipstick . Opris has captured some classically romantic images  underwater, here both couples appear to be sharing a passionate embrace as they dance . Opris has photographed dozens of couples but he said he still sees a unique side to every image as each individual pair brings their own character to the shoot. 'This is all about the couple celebrating each other in their own style. Some bring costumes underwater, others bring their Manolo Blahniks,' he said. 'The shoots are a lot of fun. Most couples end up feeling like kids again being able to play in the water with their clothes on!' Opris has photographed dozens of couples but says very pair bring their own unique side and interests to their engagement shoot . Opris said that he aims to bring 'love and fun' to his photo shoots, with the shots of fully clothed couples posing entirely submerged . Opris says he has seen a real rise in demand for his unique underwater photography, in which couples have fun posing together .","Beautiful images of pairs in designer dresses and black tie shot by Florida-based photographer Adam Opris .

"Tony Blair this afternoon issued a dramatic public apology to the victims of the IRA Hyde Park bombing for mistakes in a government scheme  which allowed suspected perpetrators to escape justice. The former Prime Minister told victims that he 'took full responsibility' for a programme which saw around 200  'comfort letters' sent to fugitive terror suspects assuring them they would not face prosecution. The letters came to light last year following the collapse of the trial of former IRA paramilitary John Downey - the main suspect for the 1982 London bombing which killed British 11 soldiers. Scroll down for video . The former Prime Minister told victims that he 'took responsibility' for a programme which saw around 200 'comfort letters' sent to around 200 fugitive terror suspects . Mr Blair told MPs investigating the scheme that it was 'absolutely critical to the peace process' and without it the IRA may have returned to violence. He said: 'If I had been saying we are not dealing with this in any way at all, you can never be certain of these things but I think it is likely that the process would have collapsed. 'The purpose on everything we have done was to create peace in Northern Ireland so that there were not more victims of terrorism and more families distressed and losing loved ones as a result of that terrorism.' The former PM began the peace process scheme in 2000 which eventually saw 95 of the letters  issued by the Government to suspects linked by intelligence to almost 300 murders. They told people they were not wanted at that time but did not rule out future prosecutions if new evidence became available. The scheme was drawn up following pressure from Sinn Fein to allow the fugitives, who had they been in prison before 1998 would have been released under the Good Friday Agreement, to return to Northern Ireland. Mr Blair said he was sorry for mistakes in the scheme which saw letters sent to terror suspects who the police were still perusing. But said he would not apologise to those who should have received the letters - those who were no longer wanted on terror offences. He said: 'I accept full responsibility, because I was prime minster, for not having put in place the structure for this procedure that might have meant in the Downey case... that the letter would not have been sent and therefore the trial would have proceeded. Mr Blair added: 'I am sorry for those people and I apologise to those people who have suffered as a result of that. But I am not going to apologise for sending those letters to those who should have received those letters, because without having done that, we would not have a Northern Ireland peace process. These people have suffered enormously from what has happened.' He later said: ‘Something obviously went wrong because there were large numbers of people who said this person was still wanted and the letter was still send. Everybody has admitted that, as the judge said, a catastrophic error was made.’ The former prime minister left after a marathon Parliamentary grilling by MPs on the Northern Ireland Select Committee . The comfort letters scheme was drawn up following pressure from Sinn Fein to allow the fugitives, who had they been in prison before 1998 would have been released under the Good Friday Agreement, to return to Northern Ireland . The former PM had earlier been accused of being 'extremely disrespectful' to Parliament by repeatedly ducking requests to appear in front of the  committee. In a letter sent last month, he wrote that he had 'nothing to say which will be new to you, the members of your committee or the people of Northern Ireland.' The committee has spent more than six months attempting to question Mr Blair over the secret deals that he made with Sinn Fein. After failing to get Mr Blair's agreement, the committee  summoned him to appear. In a letter to Mr Blair committee chair Laurence Robertson said: 'You have been in the UK regularly over the past few weeks, but you have not been able to find an hour or so to meet us.' North Antrim MP Ian Paisley had accused the former PM of 'being on the run' from giving evidence. The review was commissioned by David Cameron following the collapse of the trial of John Downey - accused of being responsible for 1982 bombing. During the case, it emerged that Mr Downey had been given a letter assuring him that he would not face prosecution. A three-month inquiry into the 'comfort letters', led by Lady Justice Hallett, concluded that the scheme was not unlawful. Instead, she said that there had been cases where 'not wanted' notices were issued to the wrong parties. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair leaves his office in central London to answer questions at the parliamentary inquiry into the 'on the runs' The ex Labour Party leader arrived at the House of Commons this afternoon to give evidence about on-the-run letters . The review was commissioned by David Cameron following the collapse of a trial involving a suspect in a bombing carried out by the IRA in Hyde Park in 1982. Pictured, the bodies of dead horses, covered by blankets, lay on the ground after the explosion in Hyde Park killed members of the Household Guards . Mr Downey was released last year when a judge halted his prosecution for the Hyde Park bombing. Household Cavalry Lieutenant Anthony 'Denis' Daly, 23, died in the explosion in Hyde Park on July 20 1982 alongside Trooper Simon Tipper, 19, Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, 19, and 36-year-old Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright. Former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson has said the issue of on-the-runs started the day he was appointed in 1999 and mainly concerned Sinn Fein's Rita O'Hare. Ms O'Hare, the party's representative to the United States, is one of the most high-profile fugitive republicans, having skipped bail to the Irish Republic in 1972 after her arrest in connection with the attempted murder of a soldier. Sinn Fein has argued that those covered by the letters scheme supported the peace process. Last year the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee complained that Mr Blair in effect had 'refused' to appear before the inquiry in person to answer questions about his government's role.","Blair government sent over 200 'comfort letters' to terrorist suspects .

"She was given just three months to live after a stranger pointed out an unusual mole on her shoulder. But twelve months after being diagnosed with stage four melanoma- a terminal condition- Emma Betts is still healthy and determined to make a difference, chronicling her journey through her blog. After being given the initial diagnosis, Emma said that she spent a lot of time 'googling young people with melanoma and trying to find other people's stories' in an attempt to figure out what was happening to her. Scroll down for video . Emma Betts was given just three months to live after being diagnosed with stage four melanoma . 'Most of them just said ""I went to treatment and then this happened', but I wanted something blunt and honest,' Emma said. Emma decided, somewhat nervously, to start her own blog, Dear Melanoma, in order to document her daily struggles and start 'a conversation about cancer'. Covering everything from the plans she has for her death, her support for the 'dignity to die' cause, and her fear of leaving her new husband, Serge, behind, her blog offers a raw and honest account of living with cancer. 'While it's tough writing the posts and I get quite upset, seeing the comments and reading how it has impacted people makes me feel like I'm actually doing something for myself, as well as other people,' Emma said. 'I see it almost as a job, it's therapeutic, being honest about showing the really tough side of things that people don't want to admit to,' she said. Emma and her husband Serge had to push their wedding forward because they weren't sure she would live . In March 2013, Emma married her husband Serge, who she met just as she began her treatment . After being given the news that the cancer had spread into her liver and many of her other major organs, making her cancer inoperable, Emma's life changed dramatically. Having gained access to a clinical trial for a new immunotherapy treatment, Emma began seeing her tumours shrink, and then stabilise, which she said is both positive and negative. 'I had an appointment with my oncologist and she was so excited, because she never thought I'd make it this far,' Emma said. 'But for me, the year mark has been met more with fear than with excitement, because people who take the drug normally respond for 22 months,' she said. 'It's already been a year and so every day I'm here I have to ask, how long until it stops working? It means that life isn't normal.  Everything is now taken into consideration,' she said. In March 2013, Emma married her husband Serge, who she met just as she began her treatment. 'He got thrown into the deep end. I think lots of people wondered why we were getting engaged as we weren't sure I would live to see my wedding, but we've been through more in the past year than some people do in a lifetime,' she said. 'He was pretty amazing to have signed up for this. But it means that every decision we make now involves cancer.' 'Serge was pretty amazing to have signed up for this. But it means that every decision we make now involves cancer,' said Emma . Emma said she is doing small things to make herself happy, like having fresh flowers in the house . 'The days that are good are the ones where I reach a goal. Serge and I moved our wedding forward because we weren't sure I'd be alive, but I was fine,' Emma said . For Emma, part of this is writing her blog, an outlet which has now become a driving force in her life and has allowed her to be both candid and realistic in her writing. 'I would happily give up everything that I hoped for my future just to be able to grow old. I don’t need to have children. I don’t need to have a career. I just need to be alive,' she wrote in her most recent post. 'I know that this will kill me, we just don't know when. There are good days and bad days, but the cancer is always there,' Emma said. 'The days that are good are the ones where I reach a goal. Serge and I moved our wedding forward because we weren't sure I'd be alive, but I was fine,' she said. 'My next goal was my birthday, and then seeing my nephew born, and then Christmas. And now I'm just living one day at a time,' she said. Emma said she was determined to find small ways to live a life that was good. 'My goal was my birthday, and then seeing my nephew born, and then Christmas. And now I'm just living one day at a time,' Emma said. Emma with her new puppy Ralph, who she said brings her joy because he doesn't know she has cancer . 'I really struggled writing a bucket list because all the things I was writing down, like having children or a career, or travelling, I couldn't do,' Emma said. 'They were all things I couldn't have, and so everything on my list are everyday luxuries. Fresh flowers in the house, eating pavlova if it's on a cafe menu, drinking wine and champagne and not just saving it for a special occasion,' she said. 'I wanted to bring a bit of happiness in my life that wasn't dependent on a doctor saying yes or no.' Emma said she is now hoping to use her story to fund research for clinical cancer trials, and is hosting a fundraising event for the Melanoma Institute of Australia. 'It's so important to raise money for the trials, because it gives people like me more options. Once the drug stops working, you want to jump onto the next and the next one to gain more time,' Emma said. 'What my life looks like for next little while is tough because I don't know how long life is,' she said. 'Serge and I aren't planning too far in advance, just spending lots of time together and enjoying each other as it comes.'","Emma Betts was given three months to live when she was diagnosed with stage four melanoma .

The police officers swiftly reverse back down the narrow Parisien street to escape the relentless attack.

Filmed from an upstairs window, the footage begins with the Kouachi's chanting 'we have avenged the Prophet Muhammad' after their brutal attack on the satirical magazine's office. The two masked men, who had just killed six Charlie Hebdo journalists, then place their automatic weapons on the roof of the car and calmly reload them before the terrifying confrontation. The video shows their getaway halted by an oncoming police car - its sirens blazing - which forces one of the brothers to lean out of the window and begin shooting. His accomplice then stops the car and joins the assault on the retreating vehicle. Once the police car has reversed back to the end of the street, they restart their failed getaway and continue shooting out of the window until they have safely turned the corner. According to the Telegraph, the man filming the dramatic gun battle is heard saying: 'These are false bullets.' 'No, they're not false bullets. They're ricocheting. Look at the cops. Look, look, they're reversing. They've smashed the cars.' A massive manhunt involving tens of thousands of officers was launched but the Kouachis eluded police for the rest of the day - before eventually hiding out a print works in Dammartin-en-Goele, a small town just north of Paris. After taking a hostage, the two men were finally killed by French special forces in a raid on January 9.","Said and Cherif Kouachi took on French police in shocking Paris gun fight .

"Woody Allen will write and direct an exclusive series for Amazon, the company has announced. The half-hour series, known only as 'the Untitled Woody Allen Project' so far, will be available on Prime Instant Video in the U.S., U.K. and Germany next year, Amazon announced on Tuesday. 'I don't know how I got into this,' Allen said in a wry statement. 'I have no ideas and I'm not sure where to begin. My guess is that Roy Price will regret this.' But Roy Price, the vice president of Amazon Studios, expressed his excitement at the partnership. Scroll down for video . New project: Woody Allen, pictured in 2013, will write and direct a series for Amazon that will premiere next year, the company announced on Tuesday. The director said he wasn't sure where to begin . 'Woody Allen is a visionary creator who has made some of the greatest films of all-time, and it's an honor to be working with him on his first television series,' he said. 'From Annie Hall to Blue Jasmine, Woody has been at the creative forefront of American cinema and we couldn't be more excited to premiere his first TV series exclusively on Prime Instant Video next year.' The company said that additional details, such as casting information, will be made available in the future. There will be a full series and every episode will be written and directed by Allen. Prime Instant Video is $99 for an annual membership and includes free two-day shipping on goods. Amazon's original series 'Transparent' was awarded two Golden Globes - for best TV musical or comedy and for its star Jeffrey Tambor - at the event on Sunday night. It meant Amazon became the first digital streaming service to win a Golden Globe for best TV series. Netflix and Hulu have also created their own original shows. The Oscar-winning director's new project comes nearly a year after his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, wrote an open letter in the New York Times accusing him of sexually molesting her as a child. Allen, 79, has always denied the abuse claims, which were first raised in the 1990s during a custody battle with her mother, actress Mia Farrow, and he has never been charged with criminal wrongdoing. The filmmaker, who went on to marry one of his adopted daughters with Mia Farrow, has won four Oscars and two Golden Globes. Last year he was presented with the Golden Globes' Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award. Before venturing into film, his skills were honed on television, where he first gained widespread notice in the early 1960s as a standup comic, and during the 1950s as a writer. He has also penned magazine essays, books and plays, while a musical adaptation of his 1994 film comedy, 'Bullets Over Broadway,' ran on Broadway last year.","Woody Allen will write and direct a series for Amazon's Prime Instant Video service in the U.S., U.K. and Germany next year, the company announced ."
"A former 'America's Next Top Model' finalist now serving 12 years for armed burglary has revealed in an emotional jailhouse interview that her lowest point came when she sobered up. 'It was that point when I sobered up and looked around me, and I said ""This is my life. This is the path I chose"",' Renee Alway told CBS Local 2. Alway, who appeared on the reality TV show in 2007, spoke out 18 months after she was jailed in Riverside, California following a robbery spree and a six-hour standoff with police. In the interview, she discussed how she let down her three children - whom she has not seen since she went to jail - and how the glamorous modeling life vanished following the show. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Renee Alway broke down in a jailhouse interview as she spoke about how she had let down her three children. The former America's Next Top Model finalist is serving 12 years in prison for robbery . Struggle: She said the hardest point was sobering up after her arrest and seeing what she had become . Alway, then 20, reached the final three contestants in the eighth cycle of the show before taking part in Tyra Banks' show 'Modelville' and appearing in ads and magazines. But in the months afterwards, she found 'closed door, after closed door, after closed door, and it was just really hard to take', she said. Speaking to CBS, she said she doesn't know how she slipped from the model to the felon. 'I can't even pinpoint it, but it was a matter of about a year, where, I didn't even recognize me anymore,' the 28-year-old said. In the months before the arrest, she robbed scores of properties and had become reliant on burglarizing cars and homes as a 'tweaker'. Police had received multiple reports of a suspicious woman covered in sores. By the time she was arrested at the end of a SWAT team stand off, 'I remember feeling like ""come and get me"",' she said. Modeling days: Alway, pictured in October 2007, came third on America's Next Top Model in 2007 and was a runner-up in Modelville but after the shows she found 'closed door, after closed door', she said .

I remember SWAT. I remember having guns. ""You get to the point where you're like, well, you kind of get of like, forget it then, 'I'm just going to do whatever I do,' and you're numb to it, and you just go for it. You're like, no holds barred."" Despite the dramatic ending to Alway's crime spree, she says it wasn't her lowest moment. Afterwards, she sobered up and shaved off her blonde locks as 'a metamorphosis' and a sign that she was becoming a new person and shedding her former self. She revealed her drastic new look as she took a plea deal last month. She pleaded guilty to to four felony burglary counts and one count each of vehicle theft and being a felon in possession of a firearm and was sentenced to 12 years. Speaking to CBS, she explained that she took the deal to save her family from any further pain. She had given up custody of her three children before she was arrested and became emotional as she spoke of how she had let them down. 'It's one thing to fail your parents,' she said. 'It's one thing to fail your fans and your friends. It's something completely different to fail your blood, your children.'

"Schools will be pushed to breaking point as they struggle to find room for almost a million more pupils within the next decade, council leaders warned yesterday. The squeeze will reach ‘tipping point’ as schools lack the space or money to expand further, according to the Local Government Association. It said council taxpayers alone could not absorb the £12billion cost of an extra 900,000 primary and secondary places needed – and accused the Government of failing to make up the shortfall. Scroll down for video . Around 900,000 extra pupils in England's schools over the next decade is set to squeeze schools to breaking point, Town Hall chiefs have claimed . The Association urged the Government to ensure that all school places are fully funded and to enable councils to open new schools according to the needs of the local community. The warning triggered a political row last night as the Tories blamed Labour for previous spending cuts while allowing immigration to get ‘out of control’. Labour in turn accused Education Secretary Nicky Morgan of ‘shocking complacency’ by suggesting it was acceptable for class sizes to rise above 30. Population projections suggest that the 7.14million children in England’s schools will rise above 8million by 2023. Many schools are already going to extraordinary lengths to find more room, converting old offices, shops and police stations – and even a double-decker bus. Central First School in Ashington, Northumberland, bought the vehicle for £5,000 on eBay instead of forking out ‘astronomical’ sums of up to £150,000 to expand the school. Conservative Minister Nick Gibb blamed the school places squeeze on the last Labour government's failure to plan for the future . The Local Government Association's call comes just days before the January 15 deadline for mums and dads to apply for primary school places for this September. The organisation has warned that councils need extra help with funding ‘before time runs out’ Applications are expected to be made for around 370,000 three and four-year-olds who are due to start school in the autumn. The LGA said town halls were ‘pulling out all the stops’ to ensure every child has a place but the scale of the crisis was ‘too much for council taxpayers to pay for alone’. There have been ongoing concerns about pressure on school places, particularly for primary-age children, fuelled in part in recent years by a rising birth rate. Councillor David Simmonds of the LGA said: ‘We fear a tipping point could soon emerge when councils and schools can no longer afford the massive costs for the creation of places, nor find the space necessary for new classes, if this crisis is not properly dealt with. ‘Additionally, councils face a challenge creating places on time and in the right places when their hands are tied by red tape.' Around 90,000 places were created in 2012/13 by councils, and more are being established - but the scale of the problem is too big to be solved at a local level, the Association insisted. A survey by Labour suggests almost one in five primary schools is already full to bursting. But Tory schools minister Nick Gibb accused the last Labour government of failing to ‘plan for the future’ during a baby boom by cutting school place funding while allowing unchecked immigration. The Coalition, he claimed, had put an extra £5billion into new places and spent £18billion improving buildings. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is under pressure to provide more school places amid a squeeze on the schools budget . Mrs Morgan told Radio 4’s Today show that spaces would be provided by academies and free schools. ‘By the time we get all the free schools in the pipeline up and running, they will be providing over 200,000 new places across the country,’ she said. The minister said she had visited a school that had ‘more pupils than expected’ but which was happy to absorb the increase. Class size was important but so was the quality of education, she added. In 2013, a study by the National Audit Office (NAO) warned that by September 2014 an estimated extra 256,000 primary and secondary school places would be needed to meet demand. Of these, 240,000 were required in primary schools, with more than a third (37%) needed in London alone. Separate research conducted by the Times Educational Supplement last year concluded that hundreds of thousands of pupils could end up with less room to play outside because a squeeze on school places has meant classrooms are being built on playgrounds and playing fields. Information on school expansions from 82 local authorities suggests that just over a third (35%) of primary schools that have grown or are due to grow in size will end up with less outdoor space for youngsters. A further 54 per cent are not due to lose space, but will have more pupils using the same area, the research found. Sir David Attenborough has warned that pupils could be ‘disconnected’ from nature if playing fields are built on to ease the school places crisis. The veteran broadcaster, 88, warned against sacrificing grounds because they may be the only place children encounter the natural world – which he said is essential to the ‘human spirit’. In a campaign film for charity Learning through Landscapes, Sir David said pupils must grow up to know and appreciate nature to understand why it needs to be protected. He added: ‘And if they do not protect it – who will?’","Continuing squeeze on places could lead to a ‘tipping point’, warn councils .

"A new reality series spin-off is documenting the lives of two couples, one year after they agreed to take part in an 'extreme social experiment' which saw them walk down the aisle together, having never met before. Married at First Sight: The First Year follows the day-to-day lives of married couples Doug, 31, and Jamie, 28, and Jason, 28, and Cortney, 27, two of the three couples who starred in the original FYI series, which saw the newlyweds paired up with their 'perfect match' by a group of relationship experts. The new series, which is due to premiere tonight, details the everyday ups and downs of married life from the couples' six month anniversary up until their one year milestone marker, as they strive to adjust to life as newlyweds. Scroll down for video . The happy couples: Doug, 31, and Jamie, 28 (L), and Jason, 28, and Cortney, 27 (R), agreed to take part in a social experiment which saw them each wed a complete stranger . Going strong: While one of the couples featured in the original series decided to divorce, the other two are still enjoying married life, with both revealing their their relationships have grown increasingly happy . Despite her initial doubts about her wedding, nurse Jamie Otis, who initially described her marriage as 'the worst decision of her life', and her husband Doug Hehner reveal that their relationship blossomed during the first few months - and the only thing coming between them these days is their difference in opinion about when they should have children. 'It's definitely generated some talk,' Doug revealed to the New York Post. 'I just think that we're not where we need to be as a couple to introduce a child. It takes focus off of the relationship and there's still room to grow for Jamie and I. 'I think it's too soon to even introduce that. But it's something definitely in the near future for us.' In the preview for tonight's Married at First Sight episode, the couple can be seen debating the pros and cons of starting a family of their own, with Jamie growing increasingly broody as she spends time with some of Doug's younger family members. 'I am ready to have babies, and to do it with someone who is as excited as I am,' Jamie says. For EMT Jason Carrion and his wife Cortney Hendrix, who both admit to falling head over heels for one another almost instantly, married life has proved slightly more tricky. Shortly after their wedding, the couple went through a period of emotional upheaval, when Jason's mother unexpectedly passed away. And after struggling to cope with such a devastating loss, the couple were then forced apart by Jason's five-month-long fire academy training, which left them feeling as though they were living 'completely separate lives'. I now pronounce you... Despite her initial reservations about the wedding, nurse Jamie Otis (R) admits she is now incredibly happy in her marriage to Doug (L) Ups and downs: While Jason and Cortney fell in love almost instantly, they have already had to weather their fair share of complications . 'It was really difficult trying to juggle being newly married and still trying to get to know each other and having such a huge thing like the fire academy coming in,' Jason explained to the Post. 'I didn't realize it was going to be this hard. That was one of my major concerns from the beginning, will things be different [after the experiment]? They were, things for a while were different.' And, it seems as though things may have gone from bad to worse for the young couple, with Cortney revealing in the preview for this evening's episode that she has been 'let go' from her job. 'I'm being nicely let go from my job,' she reveals. 'I haven't told Jason about the whole work thing yet. With Jason being in the Academy, the last thing we need is me losing my job and it is going to hurt our relationship.' But the couple insist that they remain happy in their marriage - and are confident that their one year anniversary will be the first of many more to come. '[Married life] is good, it's good, I can't complain,' Jason tells a group of his colleagues in tonight's episode.

Although the shows are from the same series, they are different episodes, so at least the content of each will be fresh. When a series is shown day after day it is called stripping and is a well-known practice for soap operas and game shows. But it is far less common for documentaries, such as Great British Railway Journeys, Great British Garden Revival and Nature’s Weirdest Events, all of which BBC2 is showing on the two consecutive days. The run of programmes starts with the Daily Politics, which discusses the political stories of the day with various guests. That is followed on both days by live coverage of The Masters snooker tournament and then by quiz Eggheads, presented by Jeremy Vine. Then Michael Portillo presents Great British Railway Journeys, yesterday’s programme looking at London’s railways and today’s examining the impact of the Olympics. This is followed by a trio of documentaries: Great British Garden Revival, Nature’s Weirdest Events and What’s the Right Diet for You? A Horizon Special. These are followed by sitcom W1A and Newsnight before the channel moves to highlights of the snooker. BBC2 has been criticised in the past for its lack of original programming. On December 27, it showed nothing but repeats between 7.30am and 7.30pm and then, between December 20, 2014, and January 2, 2015, 74 per cent of the channel’s programmes had been seen before. Last night a spokesman for BBC2 said: ‘The programmes highlighted are clearly all different parts of a series.’ The W1A sitcom, starring Hugh Bonneville and Sarah Parish, has been shown on BBC2 two days in a row . Quiz show Eggheads, hosted by Jeremy Vine, has also made the schedule two days in a row .","The television schedule for BBC2 almost identical for two days in a row .

"With a name like the horrid groundweaver, you might think few tears would be shed at the prospect of this tiny beast's extinction. Tricky to find due to its size and its habit of living deep in the cracks and crevices of the limestone, it only comes out at night and has only ever been spotted twice. But conservationists are warning that despite its trifling size and shy demeanour - and its unfortunate name - action needs to be taken to protect Nothophantes horridus, which is found only in a single British city. Nothophantes horridus: The horrid groundweaver could be driven into extinction by plans to build homes on an old quarry in Plymouth . The spider has only ever been spotted at Plymouth's old limestone quarries - one of which has since been developed into an industrial estate. Now there are plans to develop a second quarry with 57 homes, a move campaigners fear could kill off the horrid groundweaver completely. 'The horrid ground-weaver is an extremely rare species,' said Andrew Whitehouse, a spokesman for invertebrate conservation charity Buglife. 'It is amazing that one of the world's rarest spiders is only found in Plymouth - and that is why Radford Quarry is of global significance for wildlife. 'Failure to protect this site could be catastrophic for this tiny spider. This development could push the spider even closer to extinction. This site is critical to the spider's survival.' Nearly 2,000 people have already signed a petition calling for planners to reject the scheme to save the endangered species - specimens of which measure just 2.5mm in length. The nocturnal spider was first recorded in in 1989 and then again in 1995, and has not been seen since. But campaigners insist its future must be secured. Refuge: Plans to build 57 homes on its last remaining sanctuary have been submitted Plymouth City Council by Wainhomes . What's in a name? The spider's name comes from the fact that its body is rather bristly - the Latin origin for the word horrid is bristly . Alice Sarr, 33, planning manager at Buglife, said that because the spider was so rare, they did not know why it had chosen Plymouth as its home. But she said it could like the more temperate climate on the south coast. 'It can happen either because the species can't reach other locations or because the conditions are favourable where they live,' she said. 'This means that over time species can become localised, such as with the Horrid Ground Weaver, and because it has lived and adapted there, it now doesn't exist anywhere else. 'It's very unique, and we need to look after it and make sure we don't drive the species to extinction when we really don't need to. It might have lived in other locations, in other quarries for example, which have been built on, but it has never been recorded anywhere other than Plymouth. 'We believe that it is probably just clinging on at the last few sites. 'It must just like the weather on the south coast. We think it lives underground, or in cracks in stones, but in truth we don't know much about them because they are so rare.'

"A 37-year-old man has been charged after allegedly kidnapping a three-year-old girl through her bedroom window - only to be chased down the street and tackled by the child's father and uncle. Ethan Odom reportedly snatched the unidentified youngster after he leaned through her window at her family's  home in Santa Clarita, California, last Thursday and told her to 'come toward him'. Donning a hooded top, he then ran down the street with the child, prosecutors claim. However, he was stopped when the girl's father and uncle - who had apparently heard a commotion - gave chase. Once they caught up with Odom, the pair tackled him to the ground, it is alleged. Scroll down for video . Charged: Ethan Odom (pictured in court, dressed in white and behind bars, with his face hidden) has been charged with allegedly kidnapping a three-year-old girl through her bedroom window in Southern California . Terrifying: The 37-year-old reportedly snatched the unidentified youngster after he leaned through her window (pictured) at her family's home in the Newhall area of Santa Clarita last Thursday and told her to 'come to him' Now, Odom has been charged with kidnapping, attempted kidnapping and residential first degree burglary at a San Fernando court, according to Eyewitness News. During his first court appearance on Monday, he denied the charges. Although camera crews were allowed into the courtroom, they were not permitted to take photos of the suspect's face. Shockingly, Odom is also accused of attempting to kidnap a nine-year-old girl around a block away from the three-year-old's home - just hours before allegedly snatching the younger victim. In the first incident, he had reportedly tried and failed to lure the girl away from her mother as they had walked down the street, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office. In the second alleged attack, at around 7pm last Thursday, Odom -  who was 'wearing a hoodie', family members said - allegedly pulled a screen off the girl's bedroom window and leaned in. 'He leaned in the window and then told her to come toward him,' the youngster's aunt, Adriana, told KTLA 5, adding that her entire family had been in the house during the 'frightening' attack. Uncle: Donning a black hooded top, Odom ran down the street with the child, prosecutors claim. But he was stopped when the girl's father and uncle (pictured) - who had apparently heard a commotion - gave chase . Police at the scene: Once they caught up with Odom, the father and uncle tackled him to the ground, it is said . The suspect then grabbed the child and dragged her away from the house in the 24200 block of Arch Street in the Newhall area of the city, before running down the street with her, deputies said. However, after the girl's father and uncle heard a commotion and realized she was missing, they reportedly chased her attacker down the road until they were just feet away from him. 'I actually … ran behind him,' said the girl’s uncle, whose name is Jesus. 'I think he heard my footsteps and then he turned around quickly and asked me if this was my daughter.' After Jesus told Odom that the girl was his daughter the suspect handed her back to him and tried to flee, her relatives told NBC. Shocked: 'He leaned in the window and told her to come toward him,' the girl's aunt, Adriana (pictured), said . Emergency response: On Monday, Odom was charged with kidnapping, attempted kidnapping and residential first degree burglary at a San Fernando court, Above, deputies are pictured at the scene last Thursday . But he was stopped when the girl's father suddenly tackled him, knocking him to the ground before restraining him. When deputies arrived at the scene, they were able to take Odom into custody. In the statement last week, the Sheriff's Department said: 'A male adult allegedly grabbed ahold of a 3-year-old female by reaching through a bedroom window at the female’s residence.' The Department said the girl had been safely returned to her relatives and was startled, but not harmed. It added that deputies have set up a perimeter at the scene. Official: During a press conference last Friday morning, Sheriff's Deputy Joshua Dubin (pictured) described the incident as a 'random kidnapping' that involved the suspect 'breaking out a window screen' at the girl's home . During a press conference last Friday morning, deputy Joshua Dubin described the incident as a 'scary' and 'random kidnapping' that involved the suspect 'breaking out a window screen'. Although the name of the girl has not been released, officials have said there is no apparent relationship between her and Odom, CBS reported. Odom, who has a long criminal history, faces up to 13 years and four months in prison if convicted. On Monday, his bail was set at $285,000. He is expected to return to court on January 27.","Ethan Odom, 37, 'reached through window and told girl to come to him'

"A Pennsylvania prosecutor says two boys charged with the murder of a 21-year-old woman boasted about wanting to rob and kill someone for several weeks and thought they were 'some kind of gangstas'. Ryan Hardwick, 15, and Deauntay Dontaz Moye, 16, allegedly orchestrated the 'senseless' killing of Stephanie Waters, of Roaring Spring, last week and have now been charged as adults. Waters went missing on January 8, but police found her body two days later on the backseat of her car near an abandoned house in Woodbury. She was lying alongside her dog. Both had been shot dead. 'Senseless killers': Ryan Hardwick, 15 (left), and Deauntay Dontaz Moye, 16 (right), allegedly boasted they wanted to live a 'gangsta lifestyle' before robbing and gunning down a 21-year-old woman last week . 'Gangstas': Hardwick and Moye - seen here from Hardwick's Facebook - have been charged as adults with the killing of Stephanie Waters . Murdered: The pair did not know they were meeting Stephanie Waters (pictured), expecting her boyfriend, however went ahead with their planned killing anyway, prosecutors say . According to The Wellsboro Gazette, Moye and Hardwick believed they were buying marijuana off Waters' boyfriend, however she arrived at the location instead. Moye got into Waters' car and sat in the passenger seat, while Hardwick sat in the back with her dog. They drove a short distance and parked, which is when Moye produced a revolver, police say. He then shot Waters in the neck. Seconds later Moye shot her in the head. One of the teens then killed the dog, but it is unclear which. The pair then allegedly moved Waters' body into the back seat and drove her Mazda around smoking weed. Charged: Moye (right) faces charges that include criminal homicide, robbery and aggravated assault, while Hardwick faces charges including conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, robbery, and conspiracy to commit aggravated assault . They parked the car at Moye's house and stayed there the night. The next day, Hardwick dumped the car at the location it was found. He then hid the gun and car keys in his closet, where they recovered by police. 'To think that a 21-year old girl – with a full life ahead of her – was senselessly murdered over some weed is just heartbreaking,' District Attorney Bill Higgins, Jr. said. 'The next time someone tells you that marijuana is a harmless drug ...  think of the family of this young lady – 21 year-old Stephanie Waters. 'Now even more young lives will be wasted away behind prison bars. 'Marijuana is a harmless drug? Not to these families.' Murder plans: During the the investigation, police determined Hardwick and Moye had discussed robbing someone for marijuana for weeks. Moye had also been talking about shooting someone for several weeks . Higgins said the pair set up the drug deal to fulfill their desire to rob and kill. 'These two men wanted to live the ''gangsta lifestyle'',' he said. 'They talked tough and acted tough, and now, they can be tough from the inside of a prison for as long as I can possibly keep them there.' Moye is charged with homicide, robbery and other offenses. Hardwick is charged with conspiracy to commit homicide and other offenses.","Ryan Hardwick, 15, and Deauntay Dontaz Moye, 16, being tried as adults .

"A former Vietnam Army officer who blamed his PTSD for driving him to kill a cop spoke of his pride that he served his country before he was executed in Georgia last night. Andrew Howard Brannan, 66, was given a lethal injection by authorities and died in prison in the city of Jackson after his appeals for clemency were denied. He was executed for the 1998 murder of sheriff's deputy Kyle Dinkheller, 22, whom he shot nine times with a high-powered rifle after a traffic stop in Dudley, Georgia. Lawyers argued that Brannan's combat experiences caused his mental illness and drove him to kill - but neither the Supreme Court of Georgia nor the United States Supreme Court stayed his execution. Scroll down for video: Warning graphic content . Andrew Brannan, 66, pictured in a recent mugshot,  was found guilty in 2000 of murdering 22-year-old sheriff's deputy Kyle Dinkheller (right) He was pronounced dead at 8.33pm  Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison. In a prepared statement given to his lawyers, he said: 'I am proud to have been able to walk point for my comrades, and pray that the same thing does not happen to any of them.' In his official last statement, moments before the injection was administered, Brannan said: 'I extend my condolences to the Dinkheller family, especially Kyle's parents and his wife and his two children.' Before the execution, Brannan received visitors including five family members, a friend and a pastor, ate a last meal of eggs, biscuits and gravy and waffles, and recorded a final statement. He had been convicted in the 1998 slaying of 22-year-old Laurens County sheriff's deputy Kyle Dinkheller, a married father of a young daughter. Brennan, shown left during the Vietnam War, killed Dinkheller (right) in 1998 . A statement from the Georgia Department of Corrections last week detailed Brannan's requested final meal. It said: 'Brannan requested a last meal consisting of three eggs over easy, hash browns, biscuits and gravy, sausage, pecan waffles with strawberries, milk, apple juice, and decaffeinated coffee.' Dinkheller stopped Brannan after he was caught on January 12, 1998 driving at 98mph. The officer demanded he take his hands from his pockets after he pulled him over on a rural road. Brannan, who was 49 years old at the time, then began cursing, dancing in the street and saying 'shoot me' before he grabbed a gun, rushed at the deputy and shot him nine times while he attempted to call for backup. Lawyers for the Vietnam veteran said the shooting was tied to mental illness that can be traced directly to his military service and argued he should be spared execution - but lost their 11th hour appeal on Monday. In a statement to CBS, Brannan's family said they were 'profoundly disappointed' that the appeals to save his life had failed. Through his lawyers, they said that '[t]he death of Deputy Sheriff Kyle Dinkheller was a terrible tragedy. 'Executing a 66-year old decorated Vietnam veteran with no prior criminal record who was seriously ill at the time of the crime only compounds the tragedy.' According to the convict's lawyers, Brannan was diagnosed in 1991 as being '100-per cent disabled' by PTSD. Five years later, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder disorder, according to CBS. At the time of the shooting, the veteran was not on any medication, his current lawyers said, blaming his previous legal team for not making more of his mental history at his trial where a plea of insanity was rejected by the jury. The horrifying moment that Brannan shot dead the officer was caught on his patrol car's dashcam. On the tape, Dinkheller pulled Brannan's truck over for speeding in Laurens County, Georgia around 5.30pm. Officer Dinkheller repeatedly asked the suspect to remove his hand from his pockets - in response, Brannan danced around and sang, appearing to mock the deputy. The 66-year-old then cursed and yelled at the deputy and proclaimed that he was a 'goddamn Vietnam combat veteran'. The suspect then ducked inside his pickup truck, pulled out a M-1 carbine rifle and began firing at the deputy. The two men exchanged shots, leaving Brannan with a wound to the abdomen while Dinkheller was shot nine times. Dinkheller can be heard screaming on the dashcam tape as Brannan closed in on him and delivered one last shot at point-blank range before yelling: 'die f*****'. In a sickening image from the patrol car dashcam, the suspect can be seen sneaking around the car with his rifle to where the officer lay injured and firing again . Deputy Dinkheller was gunned down by Brannan in 1998 after he pulled the man over for speeding . The two exchanged shots and Brannan suffered a wound to the abdomen while Dinkheller was shot nine times, during the incident caught on the officer's dashcam . The suspect was found during a search the next morning and taken into custody. Officer Dinkheller left behind an expectant wife and 22-month-old daughter when he died on January 12, 1998. Deputy Dinkheller's son was born in early September 1998. Earlier this month, the fallen officer's father, Kirk Dinkheller, wrote on Facebook: 'January 12, 2015 it will be 17 years since my son Kyle was murdered in the line of duty and on January 13, 2015 his killer will finally be held accountable. 'Nothing will ever bring my son back, but finally some justice for the one who took him from his children and his family.' At his 2000 trial, Brannan, who had no prior criminal record, pleaded guilty by reason of insanity. However a court-appointed psychiatrist said Brannan was in his right mind when he killed Dinkheller. The psychiatrist also said Brannan may have killed the 22-year-old officer because he felt he was being disrespectful. The veteran's own psychiatrist was not called as a witness at the trial. Brannan pleaded guilty by reason of insanity which was rejected by the jury. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. His attorneys have tried numerous times - three appeals, four petitions, and five motions - to avoid execution, saying that the veteran's damaged mental health led him to killing Dinkheller. Brannan served as a first lieutenant with the U.S. Army in Vietnam after volunteering in 1968. He received commendations and a Bronze Star for his service as an officer. According to CBS, he acted as a Forward Observer - directing fire at the enemy, near the Laos border. A fellow veteran, Ray Chastain, wrote a letter for his friend to the parole board. It read: 'During the period when Lieutenant Brannan served, the Forward Observer had the shortest life expectancy of any category of soldier in Vietnam.'

"Pope Francis was forced to cancel a planned meeting with Sri Lankan bishops - because he was 'exhausted' after a long journey exposed to the sun. The 78-year-old arrived in the capital Colombo on Tuesday on his Asia tour before travelling for an hour into the city from the airport on roads lined with well-wishers. The pope was taken in an open-top car with no protection from the strong sun and after a long overnight flight from Rome. Pope Francis was forced to cancel a planned meeting with Sri Lankan bishops - because he was 'exhausted' after a long journey exposed to the sun . A source working on security arrangements revealed that the pontiff looked 'exhausted' after his journey . A Vatican spokesman had said earlier that the meeting with the bishops had been cancelled due to the pope's late arrival from the airport. But a source working on security arrangements who asked not to be named told AFP the pontiff looked 'exhausted' after his journey. Pope Francis has shunned the pomp of his predecessors, and said earlier this year he prefers not to use the bulletproof 'popemobile' favoured by previous pontiffs. Journalists travelling with him said he appeared on good form during the flight. But after disembarking, he spent nearly two hours in total greeting dignitaries and well-wishers along the 28-kilometer (18-mile) route into town - under scorching sun. After disembarking, he spent nearly two hours in total greeting dignitaries and well-wishers along the 28-kilometer (18-mile) route into town - under scorching sun . A weary and delayed Francis skipped a lunchtime meeting with Sri Lanka's bishops to rest before completing the rest of his grueling day . A weary and delayed Francis skipped a lunchtime meeting with Sri Lanka's bishops to rest before completing the rest of his grueling day. 'The health of the pope is good,' the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said today. 'He was a little tired after the 28 kilometers under the sun, but now he has again his strength.' Francis is the first pope to visit Sri Lanka since the government crushed a 25-year civil war by ethnic Tamil rebels demanding an independent Tamil nation because of perceived discrimination by governments dominated by the Sinhalese majority. U.N. estimates say 80,000 to 100,000 people were killed during the war, which ended in 2009; other reports suggest the toll could be much higher. With 40 costumed elephants lining the airport road behind him and a 21-canon salute booming out, Francis said that finding true peace after so much bloodshed 'can only be done by overcoming evil with good, and by cultivating those virtues which foster reconciliation, solidarity and peace.' About 40 costumed elephants lined the airport road while a 21-canon salute boomed out before Francis spoke of 'finding true peace' He did not specifically mention Sri Lanka's refusal to cooperate with a U.N. investigation into alleged war crimes committed in the final months of the war. But he said: 'The process of healing also needs to include the pursuit of truth, not for the sake of opening old wounds, but rather as a necessary means of promoting justice, healing and unity.' A 2011 U.N. report said up to 40,000 Tamil civilians may have been killed in the last months of the civil war, and accused both sides of serious human rights violations. It said the government was suspected of deliberately shelling civilians and hospitals and preventing food and medicine from getting to civilians trapped in the war zone. The Tamil Tiger rebels were accused of recruiting child soldiers and holding civilians as human shields and firing from among them. A few months after the U.N. report was released, the government of longtime President Mahinda Rajapaksa released its own Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission findings, which concluded that Sri Lanka's military didn't intentionally target civilians at the end of the war and that the rebels routinely violated international humanitarian law. The Vatican estimated that some 200,000-300,000 people lined Francis' route in from the airport . Sri Lankan Hindu priest Kurakkal Somasundaram, right, presents a shawl to Pope Francis during an inter-religious meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka . Sri Lanka's new president, Maithripala Sirisena who unseated Rajapaksa last week, has promised to launch a domestic inquiry into wartime abuses, but has also pledged to protect everyone who contributed to the defeat of the Tamil Tiger separatists from international legal action. Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said the responsibility for finding the truth was Sri Lanka's alone and stressed that Francis had made clear that the goal of determining the truth isn't to open old wounds. Sirisena, who was sworn in Friday, told Francis in the airport welcoming ceremony that his government aims to promote 'peace and friendship among our people after overcoming a cruel terrorist conflict.' 'We are a people who believe in religious tolerance and coexistence based on our centuries-old heritage,' he said. Wind blows the mantle of Pope Francis as he delivers his speech at Colombo's International airport, Sri Lanka . An aide gives assistance to Pope Francis after the wind blew his mantle around his face during a speech . Pope Francis arrived in Sri Lanka bearing a message of peace and reconciliation among different faiths on the island as he began a two-nation Asia tour . In a show of that coexistence, the pope's welcome ceremony at Colombo's airport featured traditional dancers and drummers from both ethnic groups and a children's choir serenading him in both of Sri Lanka's languages. Tamils, however, say they are still discriminated against, and human rights activists said the previous government wasn't serious about probing rights abuses. The Vatican estimated that some 200,000-300,000 people lined Francis' route in from the airport. After resting, Francis met with Sirisena privately at the presidential palace in the late afternoon and then rallied to greet dozens of saffron-robbed Buddhist monks and representatives of Sri Lanka's other main religions. At one point, he donned a saffron shawl over his shoulders, a traditional Tamil sign of honor. The pope's welcome ceremony at Colombo's airport featured traditional dancers and drummers from both ethnic groups and a children's choir serenading him in both of Sri Lanka's languages . Francis is the first pope to visit Sri Lanka since the government crushed a 25-year civil war by ethnic Tamil rebels . 'What is needed now is healing and unity, not further division and conflict,' Francis told the audience. 'It is my hope that interreligious and ecumenical cooperation will demonstrate that men and women do not have to forsake their identity, whether ethnic or religious, in order to live in harmony with their brothers and sisters.' Some 70 percent of Sri Lankans are Buddhist - most from the Sinhalese ethnic group. Another 13 percent are Hindu, most of them Tamil, and some 10 percent are Muslim. Catholics make up less than 7 percent of the island nation's 20 million people, but the church counts both Sinhalese and Tamils as members and sees itself as a strong source of national unity. When John Paul visited in 1995, Buddhist representatives boycotted his interfaith meeting to protest his views on the Buddhist concept of salvation. Later in the day the pope flies into Tamil territory to pray at a shrine beloved by both Sinhalese and Tamil faithful . Elephants lined the route from Colombo's International airport ahead of the pope's arrival . Journalists travelling with the pope from Rome said he appeared on good form during the flight . 'It is a blessing and will be helpful for interreligious friendship,' said the Rev. Wimalananda, a young Buddhist monk, who was out on the street to welcome the pope. Francis arrived just days after Rajapaksa was upset in an election he had called. The victor, Sirisena, had defected from the ruling party in November in a surprise move and won the election by capitalsing on Rajapaksa's unpopularity among ethnic and religious minorities. On Wednesday, Francis will canonise Sri Lanka's first saint, the Rev. Joseph Vaz, a 17th-century missionary from India who is credited with having revived the Catholic faith among both Sinhalese and Tamils amid persecution by Dutch colonial rulers, who were Calvinists. Colombo's beachfront Galle Face Green was filling up on Tuesday evening with people who planned to camp out overnight to secure a good spot for the Mass. Later in the day he flies into Tamil territory to pray at a shrine beloved by both Sinhalese and Tamil faithful. On Thursday he heads to the Philippines, the largest Roman Catholic country in Asia and the third-largest in the world, for the second and final leg of the journey.","Pope arrived in Colombo, Sri Lanka today after long haul flight from Rome .

"Wearing clothes made from cloth covered with tiny silver wires may reduce your heating bills in the future. This is because scientists have found that a new material made of cotton coated in silver nanowires, effectively traps heat inside a person’s clothing, to keep the wearer cosy. The say it is also breathable and lightweight, making it comfortable to wear. Scientists have found that a new material made of cotton coated in silver nanowires, effectively traps heat inside a person’s clothing, to keep the wearer cosy. These images show the wires under the microscope at different magnifications, which because they are closely packed together, form a conductive network . Scientists from Stanford University in California developed the prototype material using silver because it reflects infrared radiation back towards the body, Popular Science reported. In order to make the metallic material comfortable to wear, they dipped cotton into a solution of silver nanowires that can sit on top of everyday clothing, according to the study published in Nano Letters. They created a fabric that’s able to trap 80 per cent of body heat. The fabric is able to trap 80 per cent of body heat, because the tiny silver wires reflect infrared radiation back towards the body (shown in a diagram on the left). A piece of the new cloth was cut out in an 'S' shape and placed in the palm (top right). Using heat-sensitive camera, the researchers showed it is able to block all uman-radiated IR, keeping the heat inside so that the S-shape looks blue (bottom right) Tiny antibacterial particles from silver are woven into the fabric of some socks to kill bacteria that makes them smell. The silver in the particles doesn't kill bacteria by touching it, but instead produces soluble ions that reduce the pong. Studies concluded that some of the particles come out in the wash, with some of them warning that when the toxic metal dissolves in water and releases silver ions, it can enter the food chain, poisoning small creatures. However, others have said silver nanoparticles don't harm humans or the environment. Research published in 2012 warned that bacteria may become resistant to silver if used in lots of everyday situations, which could have important implications, because the metal is used as an anti-bacterial in healthcare. Silver is also rare and it's estimated that global resources could run out in as little as 30 years. It is as efficient as a bulky fleece when worn like a normal piece of clothing, emitting infrared radiation emitted by a wearer, back to their body. But the clothes could be plugged into a computer, for example, to keep wearers even warmer. The idea is that a small amount of electricity could effectively turn a jacket into an electric blanket. Extra heat can be generated by harnessing the movement of electricity across the fabric. And because the cloth is thin and breathable, it could one day replace bulky outdoor ski coats. The researchers say that the clothes could also be worn indoors to negate the need for heating. While it’s easy to imagine that cloth made from silver may be expensive, the researchers claim the total cost of silver needed to make a complete body suit would only cost $1 (66p). The researchers claim that wearing such clothes could save a person $200 a year in heating costs, or save enough energy to power 1,000 light bulbs for 10 hours. The cloth is not yet on sale and requires more testing, but the scientists are already working on another coating to keep clothes and their wearers cool in hot temperatures.","Prototype cotton fabric is coated in silver nanowires to trap body heat .

Government officials were accused of 'insulting' his victims by failing to strip the disgraced Australian entertainer of the honour awarded by the Queen. Critics contrasted the treatment of Harris – once among the Queen's favourite entertainers - with that of Stuart Hall, the former It's a Knockout host who lost his OBE four months after he was jailed for a string of child sex offences. Scroll down for video . Still Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire: Rolf Harris, who was sentenced to five years and nine months for child sex offences. Right, the shamed singer outside the Palace with the honour . Harris, 84, was jailed for almost six years last July  for 12 attacks on girls as young as eight. Jurors were told Harris was a predator with a fixation on under-age girls. He carried out indecent assaults on girls between 1968 and 1986 - including a catalogue of abuse against his daughter's friend over 16 years. In the aftermath of his convictions, Government sources suggested it was highly likely he would be stripped of the CBE awarded to him in 2006. He previously held an MBE and OBE. But six months on, nothing has happened. Although the jury was unanimous in its verdicts on Harris, and the artist/performer was subsequently stripped of his prestigious BAFTA Fellowship, officials have mysteriously hesitated over whether to remove his CBE. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who wrote an acclaimed book on the Cyril Smith child sex scandal, told the Mail: 'There should have been no hesitation in taking his honour off him. 'Harris is an evil person who has abused children. 'Allowing him to keep his honour a day longer than necessary is an insult to his victims. It is absolutely awful. He has shattered so many lives and the last thing the authorities should do is allow him to keep his honour. 'Harris should face the full humiliation of having his CBE taken away forthwith. I will be raising this matter in the House of Commons.' The Cabinet Office refused to comment on Harris's case, in keeping with its policy of not discussing individuals, but precedent confirms honours are forfeited in circumstances where the person is jailed for more than three months or considered to have brought the system into disrepute. A recommendation is typically made by Whitehall's honours and appointments secretariat to the forfeiture committee to revoke an honour if a person has been found guilty of a serious criminal offence. By Royal appointment: The Queen sat for a portrait by Harris to celebrate her 80th birthday in 2006 . Favoured subject: Harris is left with his 2006 portrait. Right, the Australian entertainer is pictured performing at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert outside Buckingham Palace in London in June 2012 . Fall from grace: Harris walks with his daughter Bindi, left, and niece Jenny as he arrives for at Southwark Crown Court in London, where he was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison . The Mail understands that one possible reason for the delay in removing Harris's CBE is his insistence that he is innocent. In November the paedophile, who painted the Queen's portrait and sang at her Diamond Jubilee celebrations, lost the first round of a bid to appeal against his convictions. The Judicial Office confirmed that permission to appeal had been refused by a single judge. However the Australian had the option of renewing the application before three judges at the Court of Appeal, or referring his case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Hit out furiously... Campaigning Labour MP Simon Danczuk told the Mail: 'There should have been no hesitation in taking his honour off him. Harris's victims included a young autograph hunter, two girls in their early teens and a friend of his daughter's against whom he committed a catalogue of abuse over several years. One victim said the abuse had taken away her 'childhood innocence'. Mr Justice Sweeney said upon sentencing that Harris took advantage of his celebrity status and had shown 'no remorse'. Attorney General Jeremy Wright decided in July not to refer Harris's sentence to the Court of Appeal despite 150 complaints over its 'leniency'. He said he did not think judges would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it. Former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne's ex-wife Vicky Pryce was stripped of the Companion of the Order of the Bath she was awarded in 2009 when she was a senior civil servant in the Government. The Queen removed the honour after Pryce was jailed for eight months for perverting the course of justice after taking speeding points in 2003 for her then husband. Boxer 'Prince' Naseem Hamed lost his MBE after being jailed over a high speed car crash in his £300,000 McLaren Mercedes in 2005. Jockey Lester Piggott, meanwhile was convicted in 1987 of tax fraud which led to him spending one year and one day in prison, and was stripped of the OBE. Recipients of honours can also lose them if they are censured or struck off by a professional or regulatory body for something relevant to their honour, or if they are judged to have brought the system into disrepute. Harris was first honoured in the late 1960s with an MBE, followed by an OBE a decade later, and a CBE in 2006. In 2005, the Queen sat for Harris while he painted her portrait, commissioned by the BBC to mark her 80th birthday. Then in 2012 Harris was one of the star performers at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.","EXCLUSIVE: Shamed painter holds on to his award despite crimes .

"Just one council has sought to restore weekly bin collections using a flagship £250million Government fund – and now even that one has decided not to go ahead because it would be too expensive. In opposition, David Cameron and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles repeatedly pledged to restore the ‘fundamental right’ to a weekly bin round, and on winning power unveiled a scheme encouraging councils to do so. The £250million fund was meant to be used to allow local authorities to return to and support existing weekly collections – or invest in schemes that would benefit the environment, such as by raising recycling rates. Scroll down for video . British families have to wait an average of 12 days for their black bag rubbish (pictured above in Poole, Dorset, to be collected . But Mr Pickles has even struggled to convince councils that collect all bins weekly to carry on doing so – let alone persuade those who have axed them to rethink. Only around a third of the bids submitted by 2012 were aimed at retaining a weekly collection. Others sought funding for recycling services. Now, in an embarrassing blow, the only council to sign up to the original plan to revert from fortnightly to weekly collections has decided not to continue. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles helped create a £250million fund  meant for weekly collections and environmental schemes . Stoke-on-Trent City Council was awarded £14.3million from the Department for Communities and Local Government in 2012 to revert to weekly household waste collections for a minimum of five years. But city officials have now told the Government that the plans would be too expensive and fall foul of a new European Union waste directive. Andy Platt, of Stoke council, said a series of ‘massive budget cuts’ meant the Government cash would not cover the cost of weekly collections. Hilary Benn, Labour’s spokesman on communities and local government, said: ‘Eric Pickles blustered for years that he would return England to weekly bin collections but this has now been exposed as nothing but pompous hot air. ‘What’s worse is that the quarter of a billion pounds he spent on trying to persuade councils to switch to weekly collections appears to have been a complete waste of money; money that could have been spent on protecting other services.’ He accused Mr Pickles of making claims ‘he never had the power to implement’ and added: ‘In politics, you need to say what you mean and mean what you say. Eric Pickles does neither.’ Setting up the fund in 2011, the Communities Secretary said it would help authorities ‘deliver weekly collections’ but the Daily Mail revealed last month that families now have to wait 12 days on average for black bag rubbish to be collected. They also have to contend with an average of nearly four different bins. Local government minister Kris Hopkins accused Mr Benn of hypocrisy, saying that he was the ‘architect’ of fortnightly bin collections under Labour. ‘Conservatives in Government have taken a series of steps to protect weekly collections, and without our active support, weekly collections would have disappeared in England by this year, as has happened in Labour-run Wales,’ said Mr Hopkins. ‘We will be taking further steps to support people’s right to have a frequent and comprehensive rubbish and recycling service.’","Stoke-on-Trent Council awarded £14.3m from £250m bin collection fund .

"This is the bizarre moment members of the English Defence League gatecrashed a book club to confront Russell Brand only to find readers were merely discussing his latest work. A gang of around 15 EDL supporters stormed the event at a Newcastle bar after being wrongly tipped off that the comedian would be there. Instead the men, believed to be from EDL groups across the North East, found Bar Loco filled with readers who had gathered to speak about Brand's book Revolution - but disrupted the meeting regardless, bursting into Islamophobic chants. Scroll down for video . This is the bizarre moment members of the English Defence League gatecrashed a book club to confront Russell Brand only to find members were merely discussing his latest work . Those at the meeting said the gang of around 15 EDL members had sat at the back of the room for around 20 minutes until they realised Brand would not be coming . Police were called to the disrupted event, which the EDL members eventually left saying 'and now we're off for a curry'. Police said officers had spoken to those present, but 'no offences were committed' 'It was an open book club to discuss Russell Brand's new book,' said reader Dan Jenkins, from West Denton of the event at Bar Loco. 'But the guys from EDL clearly thought he was going to turn up himself so had gathered a group together from all over the North East to come and disturb the meeting. 'I got there a bit late so I was sitting among them at the back and I could hear them talking about it and asking when he was coming, and then 20 minutes in they realised that he wasn't coming so they decided to be disruptive.' Mr Jenkins, 39, said the men had then started singing 'No surrender to the Taliban', and 'With St George in my heart, keep me English.' heart, keep me English.' Dan Jenkins, 39, was among the readers who had gathered for the open book club meeting to discuss Russell Brand's latest effort Revolution . An EDL organiser said the men had gone to Bar Loco after one of their own meetings was disrupted by 'left-wing activists', and had Brand been there it would have been a bonus . 'When they were heading out one of them just shouted defiantly ""And now we're going for a curry"" and they had just been singing these songs about the Taliban,' he said. 'It was bizarre.' EDL regional organiser Alan Spence said the group had gatecrashed the event in retaliation for the disruption of one of their meetings by left-wing activists. 'The last time we had a North East meet and greet some of the left wing went down to the pub and abused the barmaid, prior to us getting there,' he said. 'So we thought it was time we returned the favour. Mr Jenkins described the EDL's arrival at the meeting had been 'bizarre', and said he had heard members discussing when Brand would be arriving at the Newcastle bar . 'Any left-wing organisation in the North East should expect a visit from the EDL if this happens again. If that's the way they want it they can have it that way.' Mr Spence said they saw the rumour Russell Brand would be there as an added bonus. He said: 'We went because there were going to be known activists that were going to be there and we got told Russell Brand was going to be there too. He's a joke.' Bar Loco manager Agle Dubinkaite said: 'Some people were causing a bit of a disturbance, so naturally I called the police to escort them out. They refused to leave when I asked them to and there were quite a few of them.' A police spokesperson said: 'Officers attended and spoke to those at the event.

"Commuters faced chaotic scenes while getting to work in London this morning - with two-thirds of buses in London not running because of a strike. Passengers had been warned that their journeys would be 'significantly disrupted' because of a walkout by thousands of members of the Unite union. The strike came despite the fact that only 16 per cent of drivers in the capital voted for the industrial action over pay. Some 24million journeys are made across the TfL network daily - and almost 90 per cent of adult fare paying passengers used public transport today. The lack of buses meant that the Tube and train network in the capital had to cope with an estimated two million extra journeys today. Scroll down for video . Entrance closed: Passengers at London Victoria station queue to to get on the Underground today as bus services are severely disrupted . Chaos: There were 2,156 congestion hotspots and 1,282 miles of tailbacks across the Greater London area at 8.30am, TomTom Traffic said . Not in service: Buses are seen parked inside Waterloo Bus Garage in central London as bus passengers across London suffered travel chaos . Packed: Commuters queue to get through the barriers at Victoria Underground station during a one-day strike by bus drivers in London . There were 2,156 congestion hotspots and 1,282 miles of tailbacks across the Greater London area at 8.30am today, according to TomTom Traffic. The average total jam length during the peak hour in London is 501 miles. The worst congestion was on the A12 in Essex heading towards London. On that stretch of road - which links the capital to Great Yarmouth in Norfolk - there was stationary traffic for 15 miles causing two hours of delays. Around a third of buses ran during the morning rush and passengers were urged to check before they travelled. There are around 46million bus journeys made in London on an average week, with some 6.5million bus journeys taken in the capital every day . And it was revealed in 2013 that the number of journeys by London bus had increased from 1.4billion to 2.3billion - 64 per cent - in the past 13 years. Trying to make it to work: Commuters queue at London Victoria as they wait to enter the Underground during a one-day strike by bus drivers . Making their way on foot: Commuters walk across London Bridge during a one day strike by bus drivers in the capital . Empty bus lanes: Passengers at London Victoria and elsewhere have been warned that their journeys will be 'significantly disrupted' today . Mike Weston, Transport for London's director of buses, said: 'I am very sorry that the leadership of Unite have chosen to disrupt the journeys of bus passengers, especially given that only 16 per cent of the bus drivers voted for strike action. 'As the bus companies who employ the drivers have said, it makes no sense to pay all drivers precisely the same amount. 'As in all professions, bus drivers have different skills and experience and it is only right that this can be reflected in pay. 'If all drivers are paid the average then, by definition, half of all bus drivers will need to take a pay cut. 'Any 'levelling up' of pay to the highest rates would lead to a cut in bus services, an increase in fares, or both. 'London has one of the best and most extensive bus networks anywhere in the world. 'It would be much better if the leadership of Unite actually worked with the bus companies to ensure that it remains that way rather than disrupting bus passengers.' Unite said there was a difference of around £3 an hour in pay rates in London bus companies. The union is campaigning for a single rate. Unite reported solid support for the strike and said picket lines had been mounted outside bus depots across the capital. Busy: Commuters struggled to get to work from London Victoria today as bus drivers held a 24-hour strike calling for better pay conditions . Struggling to get on a train: Around a third of buses ran during the morning rush and passengers were urged to check before they travelled . Strike lasting 24 hours: Metroline bus drivers were all smiles as they picketed outside Willesden bus depot in north-west London . Official picket line: Members of Unite union at Abellio's Twickenham Depot in south-west London go on strike . Val Shawcross, Labour's transport spokesman on the London Assembly, said: 'Today's dispute is regrettable, but not surprising given the fact that London's bus operating companies treat drivers so unfairly. Author Juanita Ingram said on Instagram from Old Street: 'Did everyone just decide to drive this morning in London because of the bus strike? Ugh. Two hours and I'm still not at my office. Gotta #LoveLondon.' And a Twitter user named 'Juliette' said: 'In nearly two hours I made it to Hendon Central. Which is 1/6 of my total journey #BusStrike.' Meanwhile fashion PR worker Erica Wenham, from west London, tweeted: 'My usual 30 minute journey to work has taken almost two hours today. #BusStrike #Annoyed.' And mother Tracey Allen said: 'Not impressed - my daughters had to leave at 7am and walk to school - it's an hour's walk and walk home again later x #BusStrike.' 'The mayor has washed his hands of responsibility for London's bus drivers, but it is not just a matter of fairness that he should take some responsibility for resolving this dispute. 'London's passengers will get a better service from transport staff who are treated fairly. 'The mayor raises questions about the validity of strike ballots, but this strike had 84% of Unite members voting in support. 'London's bus drivers are not militant. In fact, this is only the second London-wide bus strike in 50 years.' The assembly's Conservative transport spokesman Richard Tracey said: 'This sort of strike action, designed to bring London to a standstill, is archaic and belongs in the past. 'Withdrawing services will only hurt commuters and businesses. 'A better solution would be New York-style mediation from an independent judge between employees and their private companies. 'In this case, it's a fact of life that people doing similar jobs for different companies get different amounts of pay, so the call for standard wages across the board seems unrealistic.' A petition has been started to allow licensed minicabs access to bus lanes during transport strikes. Minicab comparison and booking app Kabbee said it will submit the petition to TfL. Chief executive Justin Peters said: 'Today's bus strike will cause millions of Londoners problems getting to work, or any other destination, which will have a detrimental knock-on effect on commerce. Help: Unite reported solid support for the strike and said picket lines had been mounted outside bus depots across the capital . Getting in line: Passengers queue for the 507 bus today, which runs from Waterloo Station to Victoria Bus Station . Different modes of transport: Cyclists and a motorcyclist travel along along Oxford Street during a bus strike in London today . A former chief of naval staff has called for greater use of the Thames to ease congestion on London's roads and railways. Labour ex-minister Lord West of Spithead said increased use of the river would 'take a lot of weight off the railway system and the roads'. His comments came after passenger chaos due to over-running engineering works at King's Cross over the Christmas break and problems at London Bridge. Transport minister Baroness Kramer agreed at question time the Thames offered 'exciting opportunities'. But because it 'winds and bends around loops' journeys could be 'fairly slow'. Independent crossbencher Lord Palmer said the 'fiasco' at London Bridge and the 'chaos' at Finsbury Park were good reasons to 'renationalise everything to do with our railways'. Lady Kramer said quite a number of the problems that had occurred were down to Network Rail 'the one part of the system that we actually do directly own'. She said the problems highlighted were 'inexcusable' and must be dealt with. Liberal Democrat Lord Bradshaw said there had been 'tremendous under-investment' for decades in the rail network. 'It pinpoints the imperative of getting HS2 working ... to relieve the congestion,' he added. Lady Kramer told him: 'I agree with everything you've just said.' But Labour spokesman Lord Davies of Oldham added, to laughter: 'Well, I don't.' Lord Davies asked how frequently ministers met with Network Rail planners when 'crunch' works were approaching, adding: 'Ministers should realise the buck stops with them.' Lady Kramer said there were frequent meetings. 'There are many lessons to be learned from the experiences of the last couple of weeks, which have been inexcusable.' 'A simple solution that would help keep London moving, is to grant access to London's licensed minicabs during public transport strikes, but it's a solution that TfL is just not willing to consider.' Unite said around 20,000 of its members had joined the strike, with picket lines mounted at 70 bus depots across London. A spokesman said: 'Rather than quoting misleading figures about turnouts in the ballots, TfL and the mayor need to look at the streets of London today and recognise the depth of anger felt by bus workers. 'They need to bang the bus companies' heads together and get them to allow collective bargaining.'","Passengers are warned that journeys will be 'significantly disrupted' because of walkout by thousands of drivers .

"Exactly three years ago, the Italian cruise ship Costa Concordia crashed into rocks off the island of Giglio, killing 32 people. The ship was only removed from the rocky outcrop near the Tuscany island after a two-year salvage operation. But while the cruise industry has since introduced new safety regulations, nearly a third of holidaymakers still believe ships are only built for show, rather than safety. On January 13, 2012, the Italian cruise ship, Costa Concordia, capsized off the coast of Tuscany . Unsurprisingly, in the weeks following the event, many travellers were deterred from cruising, which sending bookings plummeting by 26 per cent. Since then, almost one-third (29 per cent) of respondents polled still believe that modern ships are built mostly to impress, not for safety. A further 13 per cent of respondents admit to finding safety demonstrations on ships confusing, while 8 per cent reveal that they tend not to pay attention to safety demonstrations at all. However, another 39 per cent now believe that safety is top priority on board - especially in light of the introduction of 10 new safety procedures following the tragic ordeal, according to research carried out by cruise.co.uk. In the months following the sinking, new safety procedures for cruise travel have been implemented . Bookings initially dropped by 26% following the accident and 29% still believe ships are built only to impress . New policies from The Cruise Lines International Association include advanced muster drills, which detail each passenger's designated safety station and instruct on how to fit a life jacket, as well as the harmonisation of bridge procedures. Seventy three percent of survey respondents said that they felt that safety standards have significantly enhanced over the last three years with a whopping 71 per cent even going so far as to say that they believe cruising to be a much safer means of travel than by plane. This may be, in part, attributed to the recent Air Asia and Malaysia Airlines tragedies. All respondents also claim that reports of freak accidents do not deter them from boarding a cruise ship. However, a shift in attitudes is evident - 39% of Cruise.co.uk survey respondents believe safety is top concern . Interestingly,all polled revealed that these freak accidents do not deter them from boarding luxury liners . Seamus Conlon, Managing Director of Cruise.co.uk, comments: 'The sinking of the Costa Concordia was undoubtedly one of the most tragic and avoidable incidents in the cruise industry over the past decade, and it's a hugely important day to commemorate. 'As our survey shows, despite this tragedy, British cruisers subsequently have greater confidence when travelling and this is due to the commendable safety standards that are rife within our industry. 'The Costa Concordia is an important reminder that safety is the primary concern for cruise liners, and we're confident these standards will only continue to increase over the next decade.'","January 13 marks third anniversary of the tragic sinking of the Italian ship .

"NASCAR driver Kurt Busch has again denied attacking his ex-girlfriend - and added the confrontation could not have happened because she was a trained assassin who would win and fight. Busch, called Patricia Driscoll, who accuses him of slamming her head repeatedly into a wall, a 'badass' and said she convinced him she was a mercenary who had killed people. The driver, 37, said he merely 'cupped her cheeks' when Driscoll, 36, showed up to his apartment in Dover, Delware, uninvited after they had broken up. Scroll down for video . Court battle: NASCAR driver Kurt Busch, left, described his ex girlfriend Patricia Driscoll, right, as a 'badass' who could easily best him in a fight. The pair are pictured at a Delaware court in December . He told a court: 'I know that she could take me down at any moment, because she's a bad-ass'. Busch explained that he was at first skeptical of her ability to end lives - but said she convinced him in 2010 by showing him images of dead bodies with gunshot wounds, and a scar supposedly from a stab wound to her stomach. The revelations came as he testified again that he didn't assault Driscoll when she came to his motorhome at Dover International Speedway in September. She has claimed that Busch grabbed her by the throat and face, then slammed her head into a wall three times. Re-enacting his version of the encounter with his attorney, Rusty Hardin, Busch showed how he placed his hands on Driscoll. 'I cupped her cheeks, I looked her in the eye, and I said ""You have to leave,""' Busch testified. He told the court that he stayed with Driscoll, despite thinking she is a killer, because he 'thought that was exciting'. 'I had other people tell me she was crazy. ... I didn't believe it simply because of what I had seen and heard,' he said. Driscoll says Busch assaulted her after she drove from her Maryland home to Dover to check on him after he sent her several disturbing texts following a poor qualifying session at Dover. 'Exciting': Busch, pictured kissing Driscoll, said it was 'exciting' being with her, even though he thought she was a killer mercenary . In one text, Busch told Driscoll that he was crying, lying on the floor and didn't know 'which way was up.' Busch testified he had been crying while watching Brad Pitt's Seven Years in Tibet, a movie in which the protagonist leaves his wife and son. He said it caused him to reflect on his own breakup with Driscoll, whose son had formed a strong bond with Busch. 'It just hit me emotionally,' said Busch, who denied Driscoll's allegations that he said he wished he had a gun so he could kill himself. Busch said he decided to break up with Driscoll after the September race in New Hampshire because she was monopolizing his schedule and he needed to focus on his racing team and career. Busch's attorneys have portrayed Driscoll as a scorned woman out to destroy his career. 'When she doesn't get her way, you don't want to stand in front of that bulldozer,' Busch said of Driscoll. While Driscoll has said she wants a no-contact order because she is afraid of Busch, Busch on Monday read a text exchange from October in which Driscoll describes her disappointment that he had not tried to reach out to her after the Dover incident. The first witness to testify Monday was Nick Terry, a chaplain with Motor Racing Outreach, which ministers to NASCAR drivers. Scorned? Attorneys for Busch say that Driscoll, pictured above with the driver, is out to trash his career . Terry said Driscoll showed up crying at his motorhome on the night of the alleged assault and told him Busch had grabbed her by the neck and pushed her against the wall. But he said Driscoll never told him that Busch slammed her head into the wall, and that he and his wife did not notice any marks on Driscoll. Terry also denied Driscoll's allegations that he had been threatened and offered bribes by Busch's attorneys. Kristy Cloutier, an executive assistant to Busch, described the relationship between Busch and Driscoll as one of puppet and puppeteer. 'Patricia was the puppeteer in telling him what to do and when to do it,' she testified. Cloutier acknowledged that Busch has a temper and sometimes speaks and acts before thinking, but that she doesn't believe he is capable of physical abuse. Busch was to continue testifying on Tuesday.","Busch, 37, said he believed his ex girlfriend is a killer mercenary .

"Tests for Ebola given to a Fort Hood soldier who was found dead outside an off-base apartment after he returned from deployment in West Africa as a precaution have come back negative. A Fort Hood statement issued Tuesday night says conclusive tests required by federal health officials determined that the soldier did not have Ebola. An autopsy has been ordered to try to determine what caused the 24-year-old soldier's death. Scroll down for video . Worries: Killeen police investigate the death of a Fort Hood soldier who was found dead at his  home on Tuesday morning . Scene: A U.S. Army soldier who just returned from West Africa and was self-monitoring for Ebola symptoms was found dead on Tuesday near the Texas base where he was posted, Fort Hood officials said . Killeen police and hazmat teams arrived after 911 calls came in of a man's body on the front lawn of his home, which is just outside the base. Fort Hood said that the 24-year-old man, who has not been named, had returned January 7 as part of a 87-person team assigned to West Africa for three months and was found dead at around 7.30am. Carrie Williams, director of media relations for Texas Department of State Health Services, told CBS News the man was stationed in Liberia. 'We are aware of the situation. Testing will occur. The risk is considered to be very low,' Williams said. The unidentified soldier, who recently returned to Fort Hood in central Texas on emergency leave, was self-monitoring himself twice daily and reporting his status to medical officials said military officials. 'At this point, there is no indication of the Ebola virus disease, but medical tests are under way to ensure there is no threat to the community,' Army officials said in a statement. Hazmat: The unidentified soldier, who recently returned to Fort Hood in central Texas on emergency leave, was monitoring himself twice daily and reporting his status to medical officials, they said . Indeed, officials at Fort Hood said that the man had recently been granted leave for a family emergency, which they did not elaborate on. The soldier had been working with the 36th Engineering Brigade and was building hospitals to house Ebola patients. An autopsy is due to take place at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood. 'Because he recently returned from West Africa we're erring on the side of caution,' said Carroll Smith, spokesperson for the Killeen Police Department to the Scoop Blog. 'Because he was deceased and because we don't know the cause of death we want to take any and every precaution we need for safety reasons.'","The unidentified 24-year-old man was recently granted emergency leave .

Rescued: One of the 37 young children found in a raid on a 'baby factory' in Shandong, eastern China . Horror: Video from the raid shows how the newborns were kept in squalid conditions, allegedly fed only noodles and takeaway leftovers . Saved: A volunteer and a police officer tends to one of the children allegedly suffering from  HIV/AIDS . Shandong police arrested 103 members of the child trafficking gang who are now accused of paying women to fall pregnant and give birth in the 'factory'. A police spokesman said the mothers-to-be would arrive en masse and give birth in the factory, leaving their newborn babies in exchange for money. 'Thirty-seven newborn babies were found and none of them were healthy, with at least seven having a sexually-transmitted disease or AIDS,' the Shandong Police's spokesman said. 'The conditions in the factory were unhygienic and totally unsuitable for unsupervised childbirth and the babies were taken from the mothers as soon as they were born. 'We also found evidence that they were being fed takeaway noodles and leftovers.' Tragic: A doctor cares for one of the children found suffering from a sexual transmitted disease, infected by his mother from birth . Disgusting: Mothers-to-be would arrive en masse and give birth in the factory, leaving their newborn babies in exchange for money . Police said conditions in the 'factory' were unhygienic and totally unsuitable for unsupervised childbirth . Back together: A mother is reunited with her child who was rescued in the raid on the factory . Shandong police arrested 103 members of the child trafficking gang who are now accused of paying women to fall pregnant and give birth in the 'factory' The director of the Ministry of Public Security and Anti-trafficking, Chen Shigu, explained that 'baby factories' are a 'relatively new form of child trafficking'. He said: 'In some cases the gang targeted women who are already pregnant offers them large amounts of money to hand the baby over. 'In other cases they pay the women to get pregnant. 'This is a relatively new form of child trafficking and differs from the traditional form which usually sees the children stolen.' He added that women involved in the selling of newborns could get anything between £5,000 and £9,000 for boys, while girls brought a little less. If found guilty of selling more than three children, the human traffickers face a possible death sentence.","Police raid 'baby factory' in eastern China saving 37 newborn children .

"You can have your cake and drink it too- if you can stomach it- with Starbucks most recent sweet treat, the Strawberry Cheesecake Frappuccino. The iced beverage was unleashed on Australia this week, causing a stir when several worried customers spotted a suspiciously labelled  'cheese' syrup going into their cup. While the drink might come as good news to caffeine lovers who normally have to buy their cake and coffee separately, an image of the cheese syrup prompted a panic on social media about 'nacho lattes'. Scroll down for video . Starbucks Australia has launched their new Strawberry Cheesecake Frappuccino to the shock of customers . 'One nacho bell grande latte, please,' said one social media user, with another quipping that the drink should be renamed a 'frappucheetos'. The syrup was soon discovered to be shorthand for 'cheesecake', with a representative from the company explaining to Mashable that 'the bottled syrup is a flavor ingredient infused with sweet creamy flavors'. Several customers who tried the drink were still unsure what to make of the cake-and-coffee blend. 'I just cannot deal with it. The smell is awful, I tried one today, the drink was fine but the cheese whip was too much,' said one user. 'OH sweet lord who would drink that. WHY IS THIS EVEN A THING?' asked another. The iced beverage caused a stir when several worried customers spotted a suspiciously labelled 'cheese' syrup going into their cup . Several customers who tried the drink were unsure what to make of the cake-and-coffee blend . Considering that the venti strawberry cheesecake frappuccino will set you back between 1500 and 2000 kilojoules, depending on whether you're inclined to try a tall, grande, or venti, investing in the iced drink may end up costing more than just money. First released in the Asia Pacific region last year, the drink joins the ranks of the coffee giant's many other flavoured beverages, including the Sakura Frappuccino, which is only available in Japan. 'Inspired by one of the world's favourite (and most decadent) desserts, enjoy ice-cold creaminess swirled with our signature strawberry puree and a crunchy layer of cookie crumbles,' said the description on the Starbucks website. 'Top it off with a decadent cheesecake-inspired whipped cream, swirls of strawberry sauce and a few shakes of more cookie crumbles for a tasty summer treat unlike any other.' First released in the Asia Pacific region last year, the drink joins the ranks of the coffee giant's many other flavoured beverages, including the Sakura Frappuccino, which is only available in Japan . The dessert-inspired delicacy is available only for a limited time, and is only in Australia until April this year, disappointing many avid Starbucks fans in the US. 'A strawberry cheesecake frappuccino? Looks like I need to take a trip to Australia,' said one social media user. However, another was not as enthusiastic about the drinkable cake and coffee combo, commenting 'I threw up in my mouth, ugh...'. Starbucks has struggled in Australia because of the nation’s well-developed European-inspired coffee culture. The company announced heavy losses in 2008, closing 61 of its 84 stores, and recorded further losses in 2014. Nick Wailes, Associate Professor of the Faculty of Economics and Business at the University of Sydney, said that could not grab the local needs of the country. 'Starbucks failed to truly understand Australia's cafe culture,' he wrote for Food News Australia. The company most recently came under fire earlier when it announced the Australian launch of their new 'flat white', which some customers claimed was both absurd and misleading. Many said that coffee was simply a regular cappuccino, and ridiculed the company's proud advertisement of the 'latte art dot' which adorned the top of the beverage, reported Mashable.","The coffee chain has released the dessert-inspired iced drink for summer .

"Police have been forced to detonate a 'dangerous' home-made bomb that was found in a 22-year-old man's bedroom by his mother, who then reported the suspicious package. Harley Turnbull is believed to have brought the object to his Western Sydney home in Werrington County shortly before departing again with a friend. 'Potentially it could have been quite catastrophic, being an explosive device,' Inspector Michael Cruickshank said of the cylindrically shaped, 15cm long device, according to Nine News. 'Obviously they're dangerous in the wrong hands.' Scroll down for video . The home-made bomb was found in Harley Turnbull's bedroom by his mother on Tuesday night. He has been described as having the word 'faithful' tattooed above his right eye and a tear-drop near his left . However Mr Turnbull's sister told the ABC that she believed her brother did not know what the device was. '[It was] just a little black package about the size of a mobile phone that was taped up with wire hanging out of it,' Shayleen Butt said. Police are now searching for Mr Turnbull, who has been described as having the word 'faithful' tattooed above his right eye and a tear-drop near his left and is yet to be found following the bomb's discovery. His brother-in-law, Neil Jones, told Nine News  that the 22-year-old had said the device was a home-made firework. 'He's gone outside to an unknown car and come back inside with a package, he's dropped it off and p***ed off again,' Mr Jones said. Officers were called to the home at about 10:30pm, where they examined the object before promptly evacuating the home and detonating the bomb in a nearby field . 'The bomb squad said it was the real deal, it's serious, it got a bit worrying then.' Officers were called to the home at about 10:30pm, where they examined the object before promptly evacuating the home. They were spotted carrying a number of bags and packages out of the property during their investigation. The home-made explosive was then taken to an empty nearby field where it was detonated before 4am. Police have admitted the bomb was unlikely to have been capable to cause great damage, however they have released a public description of Mr Turnbull in an effort to locate and question him.

'There were no threats made and no person was put at risk.' Mr Turnbull is described as being 180-185cm tall, of thin build, Caucasian appearance and light brown hair. When he was last seen, he was unshaven and had tattoos of the word 'faithful' above his right eye and a tear-drop near his left eye.","The bomb was found in the bedroom of 22-year-old Harley Turnbull .

"A French-Algerian homosexual man is planning to open a 'mosque for gays' in France and hopes to eventually conduct same-sex Muslim marriages. Mohammed Ludovic Lütfi Zahed, an Algerian Muslim living in Paris who is married to his gay partner, hopes to open the doors by the end of the month, according to the Jerusalem Post. Mr Zahed says the mosque, situated in a Buddhist chapel in Paris, will also break another Islamic taboo by refusing to segregate women and men. Mohammed Ludovic Lütfi Zahed (right), an Algerian Muslim living in France who is married to his gay partner Qiyam al-Din (left), hopes to open a mosque for homosexuals . He said: 'In normal mosques, women have to sit in the back seats and wear a headscarf and gay men are afraid of both verbal and physical aggression. 'After performing the Hajj, I realized that a mosque for gays was a must for gay Muslims who want to perform their prayers.' Zahed is married to Qiyam al-Din, a South African man. The pair wed in South Africa, where same-sex marriage is legal, and their marriage was approved by an imam in France, but was not recognised by the previous government. Gay marriage has bitterly divided France. Discord: Police officers spray tear gas to push back people taking part in a demonstration in support with the same-sex marriage in Toulouse earlier this month . Protests: There were bitter clashes between demonstrators after France's Socialist government adopted a draft law to authorise gay marriage and adoption . French President Francois Hollande said he would enact his ‘marriage for everyone plan’ within a year of coming to power in May, but vocal opposition from religious leaders, some politicians and parts of rural France has sparked protests with an estimated 70,000 marchers. Riot police have been forced to use tear gas to break up violence between those who support and oppose the change in law. As well as opposition from those against gay marriage, the couple will likely face persecution from the French Muslim community. Homosexuality is a religious, political and cultural flashpoint among much of the Arab and Islamic world. Islam: Homosexuality is an incendiary subject across the Muslim world . Mr Zahed told Al Arabiya News: 'Being married in front of my family, was like a new start of life for me. 'I could have never imagined such a day would come, seeing the joy in my parents’ eyes after they had battled with my sexuality and tried with all their might to change the course of my sexual orientation.' Zahed was diagnosed with AIDS at 19, sparking his spiritual awakening. He says he regularly receives hate mail from Muslims globally, but added he is 'comfortable' in his own skin . He added that if his marriage is not recognised in France he will return to South Africa.","Gay activist hopes to open 'gay mosque' in Paris by the end of this month .

"ISIS has released a video claiming to show a young boy executing two Russian spies in the Islamic State. The footage shows a boy and an ISIS soldier standing behind the two kneeling 'spies', after which the boy allegedly shoots the grey-clad men in the back of their heads. However, lack of visible injuries on the men and evidence of blood after the killings suggest the executions may be staged for the cameras. Horror: ISIS released the footage which claims to show a young boy executing two Kazakh men for 'spying' The seven-and-a-half minute video starts with interviews with the two men where they admit to spying on ISIS on behalf of Russia. The men tell an interviewer off-camera their names are Mamayev Jambulat Yesenajovich and Ashimov Sergey Nikolayavich, that they are Kazakh and were recruited by 'Russian Intelligence'. The 'execution scene' sees the ISIS soldier dressed in a camouflage uniform with the young boy standing next to him holding a handgun.

After the supposed executions, the young boys is asked who he will be 'in the future' 'I will be the one who slaughters you, o kuffar (non-Muslim),' the smiling boy responds. 'I will be a mujahid, insha'allah (God willing)' MailOnline has not been able to verify the authenticity of the video, which was uploaded to an anonymous vidme account linked to a Twitter user no longer in use.","Video released by ISIS allegedly shows young boy executing two men .

"This is the moment an escaped elephant crushed a car by climbing on top of it during mating season at a Thai national park. The silver vehicle, carrying a family, was making its way through the Khao Yai National Park near Bangkok on the way to National Children's Day celebrations nearby. However, the driver of the car was forced to stop as the male elephant wandered out into the middle of the road and approached the car. The silver car was making its way through the Khao Yai National Park, when an elephant approached the vehicle and tried to sit on it . Footage shows the elephant putting its front legs on the vehicle before bringing up its hind legs and standing on the bonnet . After a few seconds the elephant then appears to jump off the car leaving the front of the vehicle badly dented and with a cracked windscreen . Footage filmed by  a mobile phone from within the vehicle, then shows the animal getting extremely close to the car before resting its trunk on the bonnet. Then the elephant can be seen putting its two front feet on top of the bonnet before bringing up its hind legs and almost sitting on the front of the vehicle. The giant creature then jumps off the car on to the ground and walks away leaving a badly dented bonnet with a cracked windscreen. Before climbing on top of the car, the elephant approached the vehicle after wandering out into the middle of the road . The animal appeared to rest its trunk on the bonnet before going on to stand on top of the car. Vets believe the elephant may have been stressed due to mating season . Fortunately the family inside the vehicle were unharmed. It is the second such incident this month involving an elephant inside the park after one damaged another three vehicles on New Year's Day. It is unclear if the same elephant was involved in both incidents. Patarapol Maneeorn, a government veterinarian told the National that elephants do not usually approach cars, but this particular creature might be stressed due to mating season. Earlier this month, an elephant also damaged three cars within the same national park, although vets are unsure if it was the same creature . He said: 'In the mating season, the elephant might have developed some stress. Moving vehicles might have added to the tension.' Male elephants are usually forced out of their herd when they reach reproductive age so they do not mate with their blood relatives. It is thought this is why the elephant has escaped and people driving through the park are being told to be extra vigilant.","Family were driving their car through Khao Yai National Park near Bangkok .

Mr Lee's images are accompanied by a quote from Jack Kerouac’s famous novel, On the Road: ‘There was nowhere to go but everywhere' ‘I had an old Hasselblad film camera with me and between scenes I started to photograph everything around me. ‘From that moment on I was hooked. The joy I still get from seeing an image projected onto ground glass, or the smell of developer is enough to keep me shooting with a smile on my face. ‘I love portraiture, though more recently I have started to enjoy photographing landscape.

"A missing Nashville infant has been found in Alabama and her babysitter charged with kidnapping her. Four-month-old Jalayia Gonzalez and her babysitter Javeele Thomas disappeared from the child's family home in Antioch last Thursday. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation issued an alert over the child and the pair were found several hours later in Lineville - over 280 miles south of Nashville. The alert was cancelled on Sunday. Javeele Thomas, left, has been charged with kidnapping four-month-old Jalayia Gonzalez who she was babysitting; Thomas had told her boyfriend that she had been pregnant and that the child was his . Police said that Thomas was pulled over in a car driven by a man. Gonzalez was found inside and was said to be safe and well-cared for. The male driver was under the impression Thomas was the child's mother,  Wkrn.com reports. Lineville Police Department chief Monty Giddens said that Thomas had told her boyfriend in May or June last year that she was pregnant and that he was the father. Giddens said Thomas lost the baby around October and stopped talking to the father in November, before re-establishing contact with him and informing him she had given birth. The pair were subject to an endangered child, missing persons, alert by police; Gonzalez was found in the back of a car being driven by Thomas' boyfriend on Sunday . Thomas then 'made arrangements' to babysit Gonzalez and meet her boyfriend, Gidden said. And upon doing so presented the child 'to him as their child'. The couple were on their way to Lineville to see the man's family when they were stopped. Thomas has been charged with second degree kidnapping, but has been released on a $20,000 bond.","Javeele Thomas told her boyfriend she was pregnant but lost her child .

"This frightening photo shows how a young man's leg swelled to nearly four times its normal size in a life-threatening medical episode he believes was triggered by a game of limbo. Dylan Skilton, 19, from the Central Coast of New South Wales, is learning to walk again after an alarming medical scare where blood in his leg became clotted in late October. Doctors twice told his family he was going to die during the episode caused by the Factor V Leiden blood disorder, a condition that rarely causes clots in fit young people. At one point during the months-long ordeal, doctors were removing 9L of fluid from his leg each day. Dylan believes he first began experiencing symptoms after playing the popular party game in mid-October. Scroll down for video . 'They were taking 9 litres of fluid, a day, out of my leg': Doctors sliced open Dylan Skilton's leg after it swelled up dramatically after a game of limbo. His leg swelled because of clotting caused by his Factor V Leiden disorder . Dylan Skilton was a very fit, healthy young man (left), telling Daily Mail Australia he did 80 push ups every night. But the disorder left him hospitalised for weeks (right) and doctors twice told his family he was going to die . Cleaved open: Doctors had to slice open Dylan's leg to clear the clots and reduce his leg swelling . 'They called my parents and told them to come in straight away', Dylan told Daily Mail Australia as he continues on his path to recovery . 'I had a sore back at the start, a couple of weeks before it all happened. I thought I did that doing limbo, of all things,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I went to the doctors and got a CT scan and all that and he said, ""you've probably just pulled muscles."" And then I started to get a swollen leg.' Within a couple of weeks his leg had become more sore - made even worse when he fell off his bike. He was hospitalised on October 28 after finding himself completely immobilised by his engorged leg. Blood clotted from below his kidneys to his heel and blood had pooled behind his stomach. He was immediately admitted to Gosford Hospital for emergency surgery, with doctors slicing him open. 'They called my parents and told them to come in straight away,' Dylan told Daily Mail Australia, recounting the hours after he was taken into hospital in late October. 'That night they took me down and it was only going to be a three hour operation. (I) said goodbye to mum, said ""mum I love you"". 'That was about 10pm at night. I didn't come out until 5 in the morning. 'They went to my mum and dad saying, ""we've done all we can. We don't think he's going to make the day."" 'I wasn't awake or anything but I can imagine how bad it would have been.' Hospitalised: Dylan Skilton, pictured, has spent two months in hospital on account of his reaction . Dylan, pictured here with his nephew, was fit and healthy prior to the incident . After six days in an induced coma, Dylan woke. But within ten days all of his clots returned, plus an additional one in his pulmonary artery, because of an allergic reaction to blood medication. He was whisked to St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney's inner east on November 8 where - for a second time - doctors told the family he was likely going to die during an operation to remove the clots. 'I was awake this time, so I was a bit shocked. I was like, ""this is a little crazy"",' Dylan said. Doctors managed to save both his life and his leg, although he is now unable to lift his toes or his ankle. Haematologist Dr Trevor Forster, from the Queensland University of Technology, told Daily Mail Australia a clotting episode could have been triggered by a trauma such as limbo. 'It is entirely possible he constricted a vessel or damaged a vessel doing an activity, and because of his Factor V Leiden the clotting process just went on uncontrolled,' Dr Forster said. Dr Forster said clotting episodes could be a 'life changing' event. After 15 operations, Dylan has stabilised and is currently in Gosford Rehabilitation Hospital, learning to walk again and taking blood thinning medication. 'I'm hobbling around. I can walk - not well - but I can limp,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I walk like a duck without my crutches. I'm pretty stable with them'. 'Everything's coming out alright now, I'm feeling a bit better.' Supporters can keep track of Dylan's journey on his Facebook page.","This young man's leg swelled to 'three or four times' its normal size .

Of the Californians surveyed, 77 percent said they frequently engage in social media self-promotion by sharing pictures of trips and special locations, memorable events, and work-related good news. Not far behind were two other Western states, Washington and Nevada. With all the opportunities for well-lit selfies, it's no surprise that Nevada--home to Fabulous Las Vegas--ranked as one of the top 3 most boastful states on social media . Social media users in the Evergreen State take to social media to do their boasting about 76 percent of the time. Slightly lower on the list, the Silver State reported about a 72 percent rate of social media boastfulness.

I might be old-fashioned but I'm not going to be scared. I'm selling it as a one-off.' The mother-of-two added: 'All age groups should know what happened. What happened in France is very upsetting, it was very wrong – for a silly cartoon that was a joke to make people laugh. I've ordered over 100 copies. I'm just doing my job and providing a service.

"Ebola panic is swarming New York City as it emerged infected doctor Craig Spencer rode the subway, visited a crowded bowling hot spot and took an Uber cab just one day before he was rushed to the hospital with a 103F fever. The Doctors Without Borders physician tested positive for the deadly virus seven days after returning from Guinea where he was treating Ebola patients. But instead of steering clear of crowds, the 33-year-old last night took the subway from Harlem to Williamsburg, where he  visited The Gutter, before taking an Uber cab home. Earlier yesterday, he went on a three-mile jog and took the subway to the High Line garden - a popular tourist destination - before eating out at a restaurant. Brooklyn panic: Ebola patient Dr Craig Spencer took the subway to The Gutter (pictured), a trendy Brooklyn bowling alley, then got an Uber cab home one day before he was rushed to the hospital with a 103F fever . Ebola in NYC: Dr Spencer flew to Guinea on September 18 to treat patients with  Doctors Without Borders . The terrifying details mean that residents in at least two dense New York City neighborhoods could have been exposed: Williamsburg and Harlem, where Spencer lives. New Yorkers have flooded Twitter in panic revealing their fears after visiting the bowling alley and taking the subway at the same time. One exclaimed: 'He took the subway from Harlem to Brooklyn?!?! YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE CITY SUBWAY SYSTEM TO DO THAT' Another said: 'Now that Ebola is here, I aint takin the subway no more...' And one wrote: 'Son Ebola found it's way to NY? I'm sick' Health officials confirmed Dr Spencer visited The Gutter, which cancelled its scheduled Thursday night gigs and closed its doors. A panel briefing reporters on Dr Spencer's case said he rode the subway on Thursday night from north west Manhattan to Brooklyn. He took the A train from 147th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue down the west side of Manhattan. He then switched to the L train, which travels in a straight horizontal line across the island and under the East River into Brooklyn. Major route: He took the A train to 14th St-8th Ave, Manhattan, then took the L train to Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn . Gutter shuttered: The Gutter did not open on Thursday night and a band showcase was canceled . This is the route Dr Spencer took last night. During the day he also took the 1 train to the High Line and ate out . It's confirmed that the Ebola patient rode the A train and L line last night. Earlier in the day he took the 1 train to the High Line. Spencer left his home at 147th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. Spencer took the A at 145. He then got on the L train at 14th street. He probably got off at Bedford Avenue then walked to The Gutter. Alighting at Bedford Avenue station, he then walked to The Gutter bowling alley. Earlier in the day he also went on a three-mile run, rode the 1 train, went to the High Line, and dined out. His fiancee and two friends are now under observation, and health officials will continue to interview Dr Spencer to determine if he came into contact with anyone else who may need to be monitored for signs of Ebola. Although police taped off his apartment block on 147th St in Harlem, and barred anybody from going inside, officials insist residents are not at risk of contracting the disease. Dr Thomas Frieden, president of the CDC, told the panel: 'Our concern now is with healthcare workers who are caring for him. 'By coincidence, we already have a team on the ground at Bellevue that has been reviewing the preparations and observing the hospital working. 'We have another team on the way now. 'I also wish to reiterate the case of Mr Duncan in Dallas. Even his household contacts who were with him for several days after he got sick did not get the disease. It is a scary disease but it does not spread easily.' Owners of the outlet will now be working to determine what Dr Spencer did at the bowling alley - whether he rented shoes, for instance, or shared a drink. Ebola can be contracted from contact with the bodily fluids including sweat of an infected person only when victims are symptomatic, with the infectiousness increasing as the victim's condition worsens. The Gutter did not open its doors on Thursday and canceled a scheduled band showcase but staff made no mention of Ebola. Taking it down: Two police officers in face masks were seen removing tape from Dr Spencer's block of flats . Casual: The Do Not Cross signs were then casually tipped into a Harlem bin as officers say the building is safe . September 16: Dr Craig Spencer flew to Guinea to treat Ebola patients as a member of the French organization Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontiers) October 16: Dr Spencer left Guinea, flew to Brussels in Belgium and was screened for Ebola at JFK . October 22: The doctor goes on a three-mile run around Harlem close to the home he shares with his girlfriend Morgan Dixon on 147th Street . October 22 afternoon: He took the 1 subway train to the High Line garden bridge on the west side of Manhattan. He had lunch at The Meatball Shop at 64 Greenwich Avenue and coffee at the Blue Bottle Coffee Stand . October 22 evening: He took the A train from his home to 14th St- 8 Ave subway station and changed to the L train to Bedford Avenue. October 22 late: Doctor went to The Gutter bowling alley with his girlfriend then takes an Uber cab home . October 23, 10am-11am: The doctor contacts the health department to report that he has a fever. Admitted to Bellevue Hospital in midtown Manhattan and tested . October 23, 8.30pm: Dr Spencer's test comes back positive for Ebola . The closure was blamed on 'unforeseen circumstances' as reporters began to flock to the establishment into Thursday night. Reporters had flocked to the shuttered doors of The Gutter by Thursday evening, but no one in hazmats suits had yet to appear. Dr Spencer flew to Africa on September 18 to treat patients in Guinea with non-profit organization Doctors Without Borders. Flying out, Dr Spencer tweeted a picture of himself wearing a full yellow hazmat suit and face mask with the message: 'Off to Guinea with Doctors Without Borders (MSF). 'Please support organizations that are sending support or personnel to West Africa, and help combat one of the worst public health and humanitarian disasters in recent history.' On October 16, he checked in at a hotel in Brussels, Belgium, on his return journey from Guinea to the U.S. He arrived at JFK on October 17 where he was screened for the disease. Health officials tonight insisted Dr Spencer felt no symptoms - aside from fatigue - until he awoke with a fever at around 10am on Thursday. He then contacted the health department and was taken in to Bellevue for testing. The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said on Thursday: 'EMS HAZ-TAC Units transported a patient to Bellevue Hospital who presented a fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. 'The patient is a health care worker who returned to the U.S. within the past 21 days from one of the three countries currently facing the outbreak of this virus.' New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo assembled at Bellevue Hospital following the the positive test results. 'Today testing confirmed that a patient here in New York City has tested positive or Ebola,' began Mayor de Blasio. The mayor said that being near someone in places like a subway car does not put someone at risk because 'Ebola is an extremely difficult disease to get.' Conference: The city's health commissioner Mary Bassett (left) and Mayor Bill de Blasio (right) addressed the concerns of the public at a conference tonight and insisted New Yorkers do not have to fear the disease . 'Every hospital in the city is prepared in the event other patients come forward,' said de Blasio. Governor Cuomo hit on many of the same points, but admitted this case did not come as a surprise. [We were] hoping that it didn't happen but also realistic,' Cuomo said. 'We can't say this is unexpected.' Governor Cuomo revealed that four people were considered potentially exposed to Dr. Spencer 'during the relevant period.' 'We're already in contact with the four people,' the governor said.","Doctors Without Borders physician Dr. Craig Spencer visited a busy Williamsburg bowling alley Wednesday night just hours before becoming ill .

"Thousands: In an announcement at the Liberian capitol of Monrovia, Maj. Gen. Gary Volesky said thousands of soldiers were arriving as he spoke . Though the Ebola virus has reached the United States, thousands of Americans are taking the fight overseas to Africa in a mission called 'Operation United Assistance.' The mission to combat the deadly virus is stationed in Liberia where other agencies are currently battling the outbreak. This Ebola unit is mainly made up of U.S. troops but also includes doctors, nurses, scientists, aviators, engineers, mechanics, and technicians, most of whom are volunteers from the U.S. Public Health Service, the Washington Post reports. Many have left their families behind to be a part of the now global effort to fight the outbreak which has claimed the lives of almost 5,000 in eight affected or previously affected countries including the United States, according to a WHO report updated Saturday. More than 10,000 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of the virus have been reported in the eight countries. In an announcement made Saturday from Liberia's capitol of Monrovia, Maj. Gen. Gary Volesky said soldiers were arriving as he spoke. 'Thousands of my soldiers are arriving right now,' Volesky said, 'and they are as excited as I am, and ready to join this great team that you all have built so together we can stamp out Ebola.' The overall mission is the effort of the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scroll down for video . Operation United Assistance: Thousands of U.S. soldiers and civilians are headed to Africa to fight Ebola in 'Operation United Assistance,' the U.S.'s latest effort to combat the virus . When the mission was initially announced in early September, The USDOD officials described the mission's main goals: set up a joint force command headquarters in Libreria to support military activities and help coordinate aid from other agencies, appoint a General Officer in Monrovia, provide engineers to build Ebola Treatment Units, and establish a training site for health care providers to direct care to Ebola patients. The Post reports that health official's plan for the mission include building 17 Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in Liberia staffed by health-care workers, each with 100 beds. This is to remove Ebola victims from their home, where they can easily spread the virus, and treat them at the ETUs where the risk of spread is limited and the patients can get the appropriate care. The ETUs will reportedly not be completed until December. The first is expected to be built within weeks. WHO: The graphic above, from the World Health Organization, illustrates the growing number of cases of the Ebola virus in West African countries . USAID: The U.S. Agency for International Development is allowing health-care workers to sign up to volunteer to be a part of the mission on it's website . Pentagon officials have reportedly stressed that U.S. military personnel will not directly treat Ebola patients or come in contact with them. The 17 ETUs will in turn provide 1,700 beds to Ebola patients, but a report in the infectious diseases section of The Lancet medical journal, says that's not enough. The report stated that the number of beds needed to effectively control the outbreak in Montserrado County -- where Monrovia is located -- substantially exceeds the number global officials intend to have in the ETUs. The journal based its findings on a  mathematical analysis of the outbreak and the report states that the 'findings highlight the rapidly closing window of opportunity for controlling the outbreak and averting a catastrophic toll of EVD cases and deaths.' Ebola: The Ebola virus (shown above) has claimed the lives of a total of almost 5,000 in seven affected or previously affected West African countries and the United States . Nations: Though this mission has the U.S. military deploying primarily to Liberia, other American civilian operations are taking place in Guinea, Sierra Leone and other West African nations . Despite the journal's criticism, the mission is in full swing. The USAID is allowing health-care workers to sign up to volunteer to be a part of the mission on its website. The post reports that more than 3,000 people have volunteered online to serve in West Africa. However, those who signed up to volunteer have to undergo and make it through a screening process. Volunteers have been offered top-flight medical treatment in case they get sick, according to the Post, and a field-hospital near Monrovia's airport is expected to open in the beginning of November. The looming risk of contracting the virus is not the only difficulty presented by the mission. Also at hand is the area's harsh roads as well as mosquitos and malaria. Also the potential New York, New Jersey, and Illinois 21-day quarantine for travelers from West Africa who have dealt with Ebola patients may be an impediment to potential volunteers. Though this mission has the U.S. military deploying primarily to Liberia, other American civilian operations are taking place in Guinea, Sierra Leone and other West African nations. Hundreds of American civilians have been in West Africa for months fighting the deadly virus.","Thousands of U.S. soldiers and civilians are headed to West Africa to fight Ebola in 'Operation United Assistance,' the U.S.'s latest effort to combat the virus .

"Scotland could break away from the rest of Britain 'by mistake', Gordon Brown warned today as he criticised the Tory government for patronising voters north of the border. The former Prime Minister warned the spectacle of minister from London issuing dire warnings about losing jobs, currency and even fish and chips created the impression that the independence debate is 'Scotland versus Britain'. Speaking at a press gallery lunch in Westminster, Mr Brown also urged David Cameron to take part in a televised debate with Alex Salmond, to the irritation of Downing Street. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown accused Alex Salmond of making Scotland seem small on the world stage . Mr Brown has said he returning to the political frontline to protect Scotland for his children, and his children’s children. He spoke at an event in Parliament today, after almost deserting the Westminster bear pit since leaving Number 10 in 2010. The former Labour leader said the success of the NHS, welfare, pensions and defence showed the strength of pooling resources between Scots, English, Welsh or Northern Irish. 'This is an unparalleled achievement of the 21st century, the pooling and sharing of resources across the United Kingdom for defence, for security for economic opportunity and for welfare. 'And we are very stupid if allow this not to be talked to be talked about as one of the important cements together. 'Now, countries can be lost by mistake.' He took aim at the coalition government in Westminster for its attacks on independence. Ministers faced ridicule for a web stunt, claiming Scots will be able to buy fish and chips every day for 10 weeks with the money they save by voting 'No' to independence. The UK government was accused of 'patronising' Scots with a campaign website using Lego and the promise of fish and chips to persuade people to vote No . Gordon Brown has ramped up pressure on David Cameron by suggesting he should agree to a debate on Scottish independence with Alex Salmond. The former Prime Minister said it would be a 'good idea if Mr Cameron took on the SNP leader in the run-up to September's referendum. Mr Brown also repeated his warning that pro-union politicians were allowing nationalists to portray the vote as 'England against Scotland'. Speaking to journalists at a Westminster lunch, the MP dismissed arguments that Mr Cameron should stand back from the battle because he was toxic to Scottish voters. 'The Prime Minister has got to be part of this debate,' he said. Asked whether he thought that meant Mr Cameron should agree to the Scottish First Minister's demands for a debate, Mr Brown replied: . 'People have to decide what the best way forward is. 'I think it would be a good idea if David Cameron did debate Alex Salmond, but I'm not involved in the negotiations.' But Downing Street rejected the idea. Mr Brown said: 'If people come up to Scotland, and say Britain says no to Scotland having a share in the currency. Britain says you are not going to have defence jobs or Britain says you have got to go bankrupt, or last week, Britain says vote independence you will lose your fish and chips, pies and you’ll lose your holidays in Torremolinos in a patronising way that ought to be withdrawn immediately. 'Then it’s obvious the issue will become Scotland versus Britain. 'And people will say the debate is do you stand up for Britain or are you for Scotland.' He also turned his fire on Fist Minister Alex Salmond, accusing him of making Scotland look 'small’ on the world stage after smuggling a Scottish flag into Centre Court in the handbag of his wife, Moira. As the crowd stood to applaud Andy Murray’s win in straight sets last year, he pulled the Saltire out and waved it around directly behind Mr Cameron’s head. The move was seen as a crass attempt to politicise one of the crown jewels in the sporting calendar. In an interview yesterday said: ‘I didn’t like it when he [Salmond] got the Scottish flag up at Wimbledon.’ Today he was backed by Mr Brown, who told Sky News: ‘That was a terrible mistake. Take politics out of this. I personally felt very embarrassed. ‘The reason I felt embarrassed was it made Scotland look small. We're not a country in the end that goes for these gestures. ‘We're not a country in the end that wants to dwell on grievance or gripes, or scoring a cheap point against England or against Britain. I think that was a very bad mistake.’ Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond waved the Scottish flag after Andy Murray won the 2013 Wimbledon Men's Singles final . Murray has revealed he 'didn't like it' but was nervous about expressing a view on Scottish independence . Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander claims there would be a 'UK dividend' worth £1,400 for every Scot by staying in the union. The Scotland Office released a bizarre list of 12 things that Scots will be able to buy with the cash - each illustrated using Lego characters and published online. According to the Government, Scots will be able to 'scoff 280 hotdogs' at the Edinburgh Festival, drink more than 600 coffees or get a hair cut every month for three and a half years. Mr Brown condemned the tactics. He said: ‘Last week when the Scottish Office and the UK Government put out that statement that Scotland would be £1,400 better off without independence - and they gave the example of fish and chips you could buy, or holidays in Torremolinos. I thought that was patronising. ‘So people can make mistakes and I think Mr Salmond ought to recognise that that made Scotland - because these pictures were shown all over the world - and I would never have done that. ‘I think it made Scotland seem small, when I actually think Scotland should be big.’","Former Prime Minister joins the battle to keep Scotland in the UK .

"Adam Moore, pictured leaving court, had failed to complete the divorce from his first wife before he tied the knot with second wife Lyndsay . A bigamist who married his second wife without divorcing his first has been warned he could face jail. It was only when Lyndsay Haywood began divorce proceedings against her husband Adam Moore that she had discovered he was still married. The 33-year-old, who has 'a complex' love life has now admitted a charge of bigamy. He was later seen holding hands with a mystery blonde woman as he left court. Adam Moore had tied the knot with Lyndsay Moore in Bovey Tracey, Devon, in late 2008 before his first marriage was fully dissolved. The court heard the marriage to Lyndsay, 37, had been a 'relatively short relationship' and despite the 'usual hopes and expectations it broke down'. Prosecutor Chris Bittlestone said the second wife made the 'usual arrangements in December last year to unravel their contacts with each other' but she discovered that Moore had never been granted the final absolute decree - only the decree nisi which he said was 'only half way there'. Only part of the divorce had been completed but not the 'coup de grace' and the police were alerted. Mr Bittlestone added: 'Mr Moore expressed himself to be single. (But) Lyndsay Moore never was a wife in the eyes of the law.' Moore's solicitor Katrina Byrne told South and West Devon magistrates court in Torquay: 'Mr Moore back then had a complex life. And he has a complex life now.' Mr Bittlestone said bigamy was a rare crime in the UK, and it was only the third time he had prosecuted it in 27 years as a lawyer. 'It is a serious matter. Marriage is an estate not entered into lightly,' he added.

He said that Miss Byrne's view was that this was not 'an outright deception'. Miss Byrne said some cases of bigamy were more serious than others but this was not a case of a fraud or financial loss or someone with multiple families. She said: 'It does edge into the custody threshold. But it is a complex set of circumstances.' A pre-sentence report was ordered and Moore, who was previously in the British Army, was bailed until next month when he will learn his fate. He left court holding hands with a blonde haired woman who had not sat in court to hear his case.

"Bradley Cooper transformed himself to take on his latest role as the deadliest shot in US military history in 'American Sniper'. He ate 5,000 calories a day to pack on 40 pounds - from 185 to 225 - to play real life hero Chris Kyle, who was credited with 160 kills while fighting in Iraq. The handsome actor is almost unrecognizable from his previous role as a party boy in 'The Hangover' or dashing red carpet style as he sports a bushy beard and a thick Texan drawl to add to the dramatic change. But before he could slip into the role of the one-man killing machine in Clint Eastwood's film, Cooper had to learn how to shoot a sniper rifle. And for that expertise he turned to one of Kyle's close friends, former Navy SEAL sniper Kevin Lacz who served two tours of duty. Despite having never fired a rifle before, Cooper proved a natural, Lacz tells Daily Mail Online. 'The first time I saw Bradley I hardly recognized him,' said Lacz who left the SEALs to train as a physician's assistant. 'I knew what he looked like from The Hangover and Silver Linings Playbook, but he just took my breath away. 'When he was kitted out in the full combat gear he could easily have passed for Chris. 'It was just amazing to watch him transform into the character. Within days of lying on his belly behind a telescopic sight, he was able to hit a ten-inch target from a distance of close to 600 yards He was also able to do dead lifts of 415 pounds, five sets of eight reps each . Scroll down for video . Ten-hut! Bradley Cooper rocks some very short shorts while filming a Navy Seals training scene for 'American Sniper' in Los Angeles.  Real-life Navy Seal Kevin Lacz trained Cooper and starred in the film . Quick study: Cooper learned his lessons well from Lacz, who was a Navy Seal teammate of Chris Kyle, Lacz was hired to play the role of himself after originally coming on as the technical advisor for the film . Cooper has to gain about 40 pounds - from 185 to 225 - to be convincing as the American Sniper Chris Kyle . Lacz said Cooper was so good at shooting that he could easily train as a sniper with the military. 'I was surprised at just how good Bradley was with a sniper rifle and live rounds,' said Lacz. 'We went out to a shooting range and Bradley just took to it straight away. 'He quickly picked up that you have to use your whole body when looking down a sniper's scope. Every muscle has to be relaxed, except the trigger finger. 'So much of what snipers do is in the mind.You have to have the right mind set as you are looking directly at the person you are going to kill. It's not like you are in a plane firing a missile but looking at the person who is going to die. Bradley got that.' Lacz,, 33, said 40-year-old Cooper was hungry to learn about the techniques of being a deadly shot which led to the man he plays in the film being known by his SEAL comrades as 'The Legend.' 'Bradley soon became very accurate and comfortable handling the weapon,' said Lasz. 'He also wanted to learn about other combat techniques, how to clear a house and close-armed combat. He continually sent me questions to find out as much as he could about Iraq. 'He immersed himself in the role so much I was so impressed.' During filming in Morocco - which doubled for the city of Fallujah during the 2006 insurgency in Iraq - Cooper lay on a rooftop and took aim at a figure in the distance. Around him were burnt out buildings, spent bullet casings and the sound of grenades exploding. After pulling the trigger on a replica gun, a stuntman in the distance fell down as veteran director Eastwood captured the scene. 'Bradley was looking down the scope, pulled the trigger and saw the body fall. 'Afterwards he just said ""wow"". He understood then the power of the sniper and what they can do. 'Until then he had been shooting on a range,but now it was driven home to him the sort of work that Chris and I did in Iraq.' 'When Bradley was kitted out in the full combat gear,' says Lacz,  he could easily have passed for Chris. It was just amazing to watch him transform into the character' Lacz trained Cooper on how to hold and shoot the various weapons that Kyle utilized. Cooper never equaled the shot from 2,100 yards Kyle once made in Iraq, but he was able to hit targets from 600 yards. Lacz responded the way Navy SEALs often respond to superb performance: he said nothing . Kevin says when he saw Bradley kitted out in the full combat gear he could easily have passed for Chris. 'It was just amazing to watch him transform into the character' Besides being the film's technical director, Kevin, who joined the SEALS in response to the terror attack on 9/11, was also asked to appear as himself. 'While I was teaching Bradley how to handle the weapons he suggested to Clint Eastwood that I should play myself,' he said. 'I was a bit surprised, but Bradley said why should they get an actor when I could play the part myself.' Kevin made a short audition tape and it was approved by Eastwood. The dad of two spent three weeks filming in Morrocco and later in California. Being around the sights and sounds of battle brought back the memories of his deployment to Iraq with SEAL Team 3, one of the elite units that make up the US military special forces. 'It did bring back certain memories, not all of them pleasant. War is a terrible and seeing how the set designers had recreated some of the places made me think.' Kevin was born and raised in Middlebury, Connecticut. He had planned to become a doctor but after a friend's dad was killed in the 9/11 terror attack he enrolled in the military.. After leaving the Navy he trained as a physician assistant and now lives on Florida's Gulf coast. Kyle had already served two tours in Iraq when he met Lasz. Such was Kyle's skill as a sniper he was credited by US military chiefs with 160 confirmed kills. One of his most spectacular shots was killing a man armed with a rocket launcher from a distance of 2,100 yards. He became known as the 'Devil of Ramadi' by insurgents who put a bounty on his head because he was causing so many casualties. While Kyle was a one-man killing machine in 2006, his first ever sniper kill was a woman who was carrying a bomb in Nasiriya in 2003 as she approached a platoon of Marines. The majority of those he killed were insurgents fighting the US forces in the years after the 2003 Iraq invasion. In his best selling autobiography, on which the film is based, Kyle claims to have killed a further 100 insurgents in combat. He would take up a position overlooking a town that was being searched for insurgents and pick them off with his high powered .338 Lapua Magnum rifle. During his four tours of duty he also suffered multiple injuries from grenade shrapnel and being blown up by roadside bombs. While Kyle reveled in being a Navy SEAL the film also explores his troubled home life with wife Taya, played by Sienna Miller. 'While I was teaching Bradley how to handle the weapons he suggested to Clint Eastwood that I should play myself,' Kevin said. He  made a short audition tape and it was approved by Eastwood. 'So much of what snipers do is in the mind,' says Kevin.' You have to have the right mind set as you are looking directly at the person you are going to kill. Bradley got that' Unlike many Hollywood films 'American Sniper' does not have a happy ending. Almost two years ago Kyle was murdered on a shooting range by a former Marine who was said to be suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Kyle,33,had taken Eddie Ray Routh shooting in a bid to help the 26-year-old adjust to civilian life. When he arrived at the range near Chalk Mountain, Routh grabbed a gun and shot Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield dead. Routh, who goes on trial next month, will claim through his lawyers that he was suffering from PTSD and mentally unstable when he killed Kyle. So many people wanted to attend Kyle's funeral to pay their tribute to a war hero it was held inside the Dallas Cowboy's stadium to accommodate the mourners. Lasc said Kyle's death came just a day after the script for the film was completed. Cooper and Eastwood later traveled to Texas to meet Kyle's father Wayne to talk him about the film. They both vowed to honor the memory of his son and promised the family would not be disappointed with the finished result. Cooper went on a 5,000 a day diet to bulk up his weight so he was the same size as Kyle. He never met Kyle in person but spoke to him on the phone. 'I know Bradley wanted to do the Kyle family proud and he has certainly done that, says Lacz. 'Chris was a special person with a big heart who loved his family and loved his country.' Kyle's widow Taya also gave her approval to the film. She flew to London before production began to meet with 84- year-old Eastwood, Cooper and Miller who plays her in the film. Like Kyle's family she was worried the film would somehow dishonor her husband's memory. But after seeing 'American Sniper' she was thrilled with the result and said Cooper kept a promise to her that he would not do anything to ruin the honor of husband or her marriage. 'I left feeling like a weight had been lifted. They really pulled it off. It's an authentic, genuine look at two people who love each other and what our veterans go through and what they carry,' she said. 'So many of Chris's friends who have seen the movie have said they didn't feel like they were even watching an actor. It's been that way without fail. 'Everyone who knows him and loves him has said that.'","Chris Kyle's close friend, former Navy SEAL sniper Kevin Lacz, was chosen to train Bradley Cooper and ended up in the film with the star .

"Injured rugby league star Alex McKinnon has expressed his frustration after video was leaked of the tender moment he stood up for the first time after a devastating spinal injury. Moving footage was broadcast on Wednesday of McKinnon standing for the first time and celebrating with a grin and a fist pump. 'I'm very grateful for the support,' McKinnon tweeted on Thursday. 'Yet It (sic) is disappointing a personal video was leaked and aired without our permission.' The former Newcastle Knights forward was diagnosed as a quadriplegic after a catastrophic tackle during Round Three of the 2014 NRL Season last March. But he refused to accept the bad news and vowed to walk his fiancee Teigan Power down the aisle. Scroll down for video . Back on his feet: Alex McKinnon's supportive fiancee Teigan Power has constantly been by his side since his accident, so it was only fitting that she was the one to share in his joy as he stood for the first time . Grateful, but disappointed: McKinnon this morning expressed his frustration that a personal video was aired without his permission . Newcastle Knights player Alex McKinnon, pictured right with his fiancee Teigan Power, continues to inspire as he has stood up on his own for the first time . Ms Power has constantly been by his side since his accident and the pair shared an affectionate moment in the video. Daily Mail Australia has approached the Newcastle Knights for further comment on the leak. The identity of the leaker is unclear. The future is bright for McKinnon, whose positivity and perseverance has been an inspiration for so many Australians, inspiring the #RiseForAlex movement which pledges to offer ongoing and emotional and financial support through his struggles. He is set to commence a new role with the Knights on January 27, allowing him to be involved with Rugby League again and rejoin his mates at the Newcastle club. McKinnon commented on his amazing progress through a statement from the Newcastle Knights on Wednesday. 'I remain on the Gold Coast, where I have been for approximately three months as I continue rehabilitation at Making Strides,' McKinnon said. 'I am in the final stages of my current rehabilitation program on the Gold Coast. 'When aided to stand up out of my chair, I am now able to stand for a short amount of time with assistance. 'I am set to return to Newcastle in the coming weeks to commence my new role with the Knights. 'Thank you as always, for the well wishes and encouragement.' The 22-year-old beams with happiness in the video as he stands steadily, his arms around his fiancée's neck for support. He fist pumps, grins and strokes his fiancee's hair gently . Newcastle Knights coach Rick Stone earlier revealed McKinnon's impressive achievement. 'He's just finished in his rehab and he actually stood up unabated the other day ... he stood up on his own which is a terrific sort of step for Alex,' Stone said. Stone later clarified his statement, explaining that McKinnon can stand with assistance. McKinnon has been determined from the very beginning to make a full recovery and last July the NRL's Rise For Alex round raised ove $1.4 million towards that goal. Stone said spoke about McKinnon's new position with the club, explaining that his promising career with the NRL will also involve spending one day a week in the commercial area. 'That's going to be a great opportunity for Alex to get his teeth into something he really loves, footy,' he told Sky Sports Radio. 'He's inspiring young men and everyone in the club will be really happy to see him back.' Ever the optimist, McKinnon proposed to Teagan just days after getting the devastating news that he will never play his beloved game of football ever again. McKinnon proudly announced the engagement on Instagram at the time. 'This girl is my soldier, I am truly overwhelmed with the support and wishes from everybody in the rugby league society and the community at large. Your ongoing support will never be forgotten,' he wrote. 'PS. When life throws you struggles respond with a smile. So happy to announce Teigan and my engagement.#throughthickandthin #iwillwalkherdowntheisle.' McKinnon will take on an active role in recruitment at the Newcastle Knights club this year . The horrendous news rocked the entire NRL community - but no one more than former Knights coach Wayne Bennett. The normally stoic man, who is now the Brisbane Broncos coach, revealed he lost interest in football in the weeks after one of his players Alex McKinnon suffered a devastating spinal injury that ended his career. 'I was very confused with myself, very confused. I didn't feel as emotional as I thought I should and then it dawned on me that I was living a lie and not letting my emotions come through because I couldn't afford to. 'But I've shed a lot of tears since about him...and I suppose I'll shed some more. 'It's good to get it off my chest.' Bennett said what he wanted for McKinnon now was for him to be happy. 'I saw a bit of myself [in him] when I was younger,' he said. 'I like his style and how he carried himself and I'm really proud of him.' Former Knights coach Wayne Bennett shed a lot of tears following McKinnon's tragic accident . Speaking at the launch of the NRL's 'Rise For Alex' round in July last year, it's not entirely surprising that McKinnon has achieved  the impossible when all he could think about was focusing on walking again. His goal is to resume a normal life as soon as possible - adding that although his recovery was going to be a slow and long process he was prepared to give it his best shot. 'As much as I would love to get home and get back to my family and get back to Newcastle and get on with my life, I want to walk again,' he said. 'You see a lot of stories about people who get on with their lives and don't walk again. My focus is to get as much back of my movement as I can and I am slowly improving. 'For example, when I first got diagnosed I was a C4 - all that is shoulder movement. Nothing else. No fingers, no movement in your legs, or anything like that. 'I am slowly progressing with the movement, I am a C7 now.'

"An ugly scene erupted Tuesday at a Queens banquet hall where NYPD cops had convened to discuss ongoing tensions with City Hall. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association chief Patrick Lynch, who so vocally demanded that Mayor Bill de Blasio apologize to the NYPD after showing what they called police bias following the Eric Garner decision, bore the brunt of the ire. 'I don't care about an apology,' one union rep yelled at Lynch as the meeting devolved into chaos. 'I want to know what you're going to do to protect us.' It was toward the end of the tense 2-hour session when the yelling began, the New York Daily News reports. Shouted down: The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association chief Patrick Lynch, who so vocally demanded that Mayor Bill de Blasio apologize to the NYPD after showing what they called police bias following the Eric Garner decision, bore the brunt of the ire when a uni9on meeting devolved into chaos Tuesday . 'My members want: they want more cars, better vests, more manpower,' shouted a cop, according to NYDN sources. 'They don't want an apology.' As other cops jumped in to back up Lynch, it was cop against cop and shouting and shoving continued for at least the next ten minutes. The officers also demanded that Lynch tell them what was discussed in a closed door meeting he had with de Blasio December 30. Lynch refused to divulge details. 'He didn't want to talk about it,' a source told NYDN. 'He said, ""Everything we say gets back to the media."" He was just refusing to answer. He said, ""It is what it is.""' Before the meeting could erupt into fisticuffs, Lynch adjourned and slipped out. Some even claimed afterwards that the chaos was all staged by union reps eager to run against Lynch in the next union election. New statistics show that New York Police Department officers are starting to make more arrests after a suspected work slowdown at the start of the year that further exposed tensions between the rank and file and Mayor Bill de Blasio, officials said Monday. Scene: Antun's banquet hall in Queens Village devolved into chaos Tuesday as union reps shouted down their leader Patrick Lynch, saying demands for apologies from Mayor de Blasio aren't enough . At a news conference, Police Commissioner William Bratton said the 4,690 arrests made last week across the city were still down significantly - 37 percent compared with the same period last year. But it was an improvement compared with the 2,401 arrests in the week ending January 4, which had represented about a 60 percent drop. 'With each passing day, with each passing week, those numbers are going back up to what we would describe as normal. ... The cops are beginning to do what's expected of them,' Bratton said. Ticketing for traffic and parking violations and other low-level infractions, which had virtually ground to a halt, also were starting to edge upward, officials said. And despite the apparent slowdown, reports of homicides and other serious crimes also were down in the first two weeks of 2015, they added. Union officials, who met behind closed doors with Bratton last week, have denied the dramatic decline in enforcement reflected a sanctioned work stoppage. But the numbers were seen as evidence of growing rancor between police officers and de Blasio in the aftermath of the slayings of two patrolmen, and prompted Bratton to put commanders on notice that they needed to step up enforcement activity. The two officers were killed Dec. 20 in a brazen daytime ambush by a mentally unstable man who vowed online to kill two 'pigs' in retaliation for the deaths of black men and boys at the hands of police around the country. Police unions have accused de Blasio of contributing to anti-police sentiment by supporting protests over the police killings. Cops at the Tuesday meeting demanded to know what the union planned to do to 'protect them.' Here, some New York City police officers turn away from a large screen displaying New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio as he speaks during the funeral of Officer Wenjian Liu . The shooting deaths of Officers Wenjian Liu (right) and (left) Rafael Ramos have served as a counter argument as the police unions fight off criticism of NYPD brutality . Earlier Monday, de Blasio said he was confident that police officials were taking the proper steps to ensure public safety and to reverse the downward trend in arrests. 'By definition, every public servant needs to do their job,' the mayor said. 'But I think, in the interest of moving us forward, they have taken the right approach, and we're seeing good results.' Patrick Lynch, president of the powerful Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and one of the mayor's harshest critics, declined to comment through a spokesman. Continued concerns over the rift come as department also is taking precautions in response to the terrorist attack in Paris and reports of a renewed threat from the Islamic State group. Police officials said that in the wake of the Paris killings, someone using an Islamic State Twitter account posted a propaganda video calling for the killing of 'intelligence officers, police officers, soldiers, and civilians' in the United States - a message that mirrored one in September. The threat prompted the NYPD to send out a new safety alert advising officers working in pairs on fixed posts in patrol cars to make sure one stands outside of the car to keep an eye out for threats against them, and to beef up security at several sensitive locations. Despite the precautions, the NYPD had 'no information about any specific, credible threat to New York City driven by these events,' John Miller, the department's top counterterrorism official, said Monday. Unarmed New Yorker Eric Garner was choked to death by a police officer last year, sparking major criticism of the NYPD . The Eric Garner case sparked widespread protests. But as citizens demanded police be held accountable in such situations, the unions have spoken out on the need for police to be protected .","Patrolmen's Benevolent Association head Patrick Lynch was caught in the cross hairs of angry cops Tuesday .

"A healthy adult should be consuming something in the region of 2,000 calories a day, according to the Department of Health. But a new photo series by the New York Times has revealed just what 2,000 calories looks like at some of the UK's favourite fast food chains - and it's often a lot smaller than you might think. At Burger King you can fill half of you daily quota just by ordering a double whopper with cheese, while adding a side of onion rings and a vanilla milkshake takes you to 2,030 calories. Scroll down for video . Burger King: A Double Whopper with cheese gets you halfway there at 1,070 calories. Onion rings (410 calories) and a vanilla milkshake (550 calories) bring the total to 2,030 . Starbucks: To consume 2,000 calories, one would need to order a Java Chip Frappucino (460 calories), latte (190 calories), orange mango smoothie (270 calories), cheese toastie (580 calories), popcorn (125 calories) and a sausage croissant (410 calories) McDonald's: You'd need to order a Crispy Chicken sandwich with bacon (750 calories), fries (340 calories), Coke (200 calories) and a McFlurry with Oreos (690 calories) to hit that 2,000 mark . At McDonald's a modest-sized lunch of a Crispy Chicken sandwich with bacon (750 calories), fries (340 calories), Coke (200 calories) and a McFlurry with Oreos (690 calories) will see you over the 2,000-a-day limit. The same applies to Pizza Hut, where a Meat Lover’s Stuffed Crust pizza is 880 calories. Add a soft drink at 440 calories, baked chicken wings with dip (340 calories), and two cookies (360 calories) and you've met your daily quota. Chipotle may not have been on UK shores for long, but it is also deceptively easy to hit your daily quota here, largely thanks to the carnitas burrito which has 945 calories all by itself. Add in some nacho chips and guacamole (770 calories) and a Coke (276 calories) and you're there. Another new addition to the UK food scene, Shake Shack, has a similar problem, with the signature Double ShackBurger providing 770 calories. Adding in fries (470 calories) and a Black and White milkshake (760 calories) is enough to top the limit. Subway: A ham and turkey sub (375 calories), chips (230 calories), chicken noodle soup with croutons (155 calories), cookie (220 calories), Buffalo-chicken salad (360 calories), Coke (200 calories), egg-and-cheese flatbread (370 calories) and juice (100 calories) equates to 2,000 calories .

At Chipotle you could hit 2,000 calories by ordering a carnitas burrito (945 calories, left), nacho chips and guacamole (770 calories) and a Coke (276 calories). At Shake Shack, the same could be achieved with a Double ShackBurger (770 calories), fries (470 calories) and a Black and White milkshake (760 calories) It is slightly trickier to over-do it at Starbucks, but combining a Java Chip Frappucino (460 calories), latte (190 calories), orange mango smoothie (270 calories), cheese toastie (580 calories), popcorn (125 calories) and a sausage croissant (410 calories) will get you there. As many sandwiches and salads at Subway clock in at under 400 calories, it is the additional items you need to watch out for. Here, 2,000 calories consists of a ham and turkey sub (375 calories), crisps (230 calories), chicken noodle soup with croutons (155 calories), a cookie (220 calories), Buffalo-chicken salad (360 calories), Coke (200 calories), an egg-and-cheese flatbread (370 calories) and juice (100 calories). Some of the dishes listed above are only available in the U.S., but most have their UK equivalents. And here's what 2,000 calories looks like in America... While over-indulging at UK food chains may give you your daily calories in one meal, in America it is easily possible to hit 2,000 calories by eating just one dish. At the Cheesecake Factory, for instance, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta clocks in at 2,370 calories - no drinks or sides required. At Sonic, all one needs is a Peanut Butter Caramel Pie Shake to consume 2,090 calories in one swift sitting, while a slice of Zuccotto cake at Maggiano's Little Italy is 1,790 calories all by itself (a cappuccino on the side would be an additional 220 calories). Cheesecake Factory: The Louisiana Chicken Pasta clocks in at 2,370 calories without sides or a drink . Sonic: The chain's Peanut Butter Caramel Pie Shake contains a whopping 2,090 calories . IHOP: A Classic Skillet, with sausage contains 1,880 calories (the pancakes are included and served alongside the main dish). A glass of orange juice contains 110 calories . P.F. Chang's: A 2,000 calorie feast might include orange beef (565 calories), pad thai (580 calories), spinach (120 calories), dumplings (195 calories), caramel cake (430 calories) and wine (125 calories) And while IHOP's Classic Skillet with sausage might appear to feed two (or even three), it is actually intended as a 1,880-calorie dish for one. A glass of orange juice at 110 calories brings it closer to a 2,000 total. One would really need to order a lot at Subway to hit 2,000 caloriesTwo-thousand calories also equates to a hearty feast at P.F. Chang's, including orange beef (565 calories), pad thai (580 calories), spinach (120 calories), dumplings (195 calories), caramel cake (430 calories) and wine (125 calories). At Olive Garden, it doesn't take much effort to consume 2,000 calories. In fact, just a standard meal of a salad (150 calories), breadstick (140 calories), Tour of Italy sampler (1,500 calories) and a quartino of wine (230 calories) will do it. At Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, you could achieve the same result simply by ordering the Cowboy Ribeye steak (1,690 calories) and a martini (230 calories).

Nestled in the heart of Australia's political capital, The Jamala Wildlife Lodge at the National Zoo and Aquarium in Canberra offers guests a taste of Africa from the comfort of luxury accommodation . Located just ten minutes from Canberra's CBD, the Jamala Wildlife Lodge opened its doors just last week. Owner and operator Richard Tindale said that the Lodge was set up in an effort to educate visitors about aiding the survival of many of the world's endangered species. 'It’s great for the animals; they’re going to get more space. It’s great for the viewing public; they’re going to get more things to see. It will be great for tourism and just for the local community,' he told The Chronicle. Funds from the 'once in a lifetime' Jamala Lodge will be funnelled straight back into the breeding programs run by the zoo. Spread across three locations in the zoo, the 18 rooms, which range from giraffe treehouses to jungle bungalows, offer an intimate experience with all manner of wildlife . The Ushaka Lodge comprises six king size bedrooms, communal dining, open bar, two generous lounge areas, private Aquarium, outdoor terrace, along with a pool and spa. The Giraffe Treehouses overlook the giraffe enclosure, with the all-inclusive packages including an opportunity to feed a resident, pictured here with Canberra landmark the Black Mountain Tower in the background . The Ushaka Lodge, which houses up to 26 people, is built around the monkey enclosure and has a built-in aquarium which offers private views of some of the zoo's sharks. The Lodge comprises six king size bedrooms, communal dining, an open bar, two generous lounge areas, and an outdoor terrace, along with a pool and spa. Only metres from the edge of Lake Burley Griffin, the indoor and outdoor entertaining areas  have magnificent views across the lake to Black Mountain. 'There’s a room with its own little jetty and it comes out over the shark tank here and so the people who stay in that room will be able to go to their bedroom and pat that shark,' Mr Tindale said. 'The whole idea is when people are here it’s very interactive – wherever they go they’re going to have an animal pretty close to them.'

"Leading doctors warn today of the impact that nearly 13 years in Guantanamo Bay has had on Shaker Aamer’s physical and mental health – and they have demanded his immediate release. Eminent physicians have signed a letter to the Daily Mail warning of the British resident’s ‘fragile medical condition’. They say there are ‘pressing medical concerns’ about Mr Aamer, who has been held without charge since February 2002. As the Mail reveals today, in that time he has been beaten at least 315 times. Shaker Aamer, pictured with two of his children, has been beaten at least 315 times since February 2002 . Mr Aamer has been held without charge for the past 13 years in Guantanamo Bay naval service station . The doctors point to the conclusions of a medical assessment last year which found Mr Aamer was suffering from serious psychiatric problems and a string of physical ailments. It concluded he needs urgent psychiatric treatment and ‘reintegration into his family’. In their letter, the doctors warn that Mr Aamer’s detention is having an ‘appalling effect’ on the health of his British family – especially his wife Zin and their four children. Crucially, among the signatories are three members of a Foreign Office medical panel which assists British nationals detained overseas, but which has been prevented from discussing Mr Aamer’s case. The letter says Mr Aamer ‘would warrant the assistance of this committee’. The letter was organised by Dr David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist, human rights activist and member of the Council of the Royal College of Physicians, and is signed by 33 physicians, including professors of neurology and public health, consultants and GPs. All sign in a personal capacity. The signatories question why there was no mention of Mr Aamer in the explosive US Senate torture report which detailed the horrendous treatment meted out on detainees by the CIA during the ‘War on Terror’. They write: ‘We would add our names to those who in this newspaper have called for his return to the UK given his fragile medical condition. Further we would be happy to assist in his medical management should this be required. ‘In 2006, we tried to raise this issue with the Foreign Office Pro Bono medical panel – which can assist with medical advice in Britons held overseas. This request, to date, has been rejected, as the Foreign Office does not want to set a precedent for someone who is a British resident, not citizen.’ In April last year, after lengthy legal efforts by Mr Aamer’s lawyers, a doctor conducted the first independent evaluation of his physical and mental state. Dr Emily Keram diagnosed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and reported ‘additional psychiatric symptoms related to his current confinement . . . which also gravely diminish his mental health’. She also noted that ‘the length, uncertainty, and stress of Mr Aamer’s confinement has caused significant disruptions in his . . . ability to function. He is profoundly aware of what he has lost.’ She listed details of a string of physical ailments, including debilitating headaches, asthma, and chronic urinary retention, and called for urgent psychiatric treatment and ‘reintegration into his family’. The US authorities say Mr Aamer is treated by doctors in Guantanamo. but detainees claim medical care is used by the Guantanamo authorities as an incentive or punishment for behaviour rather than according to medical need. In correspondence, Mr Aamer has said: ‘Medical care is almost annihilated. They just talk and talk. There is no treatment, just painkillers or sedatives. All medical matters are in the control of the prison administration.’ The Foreign Office has said the Pro Bono panel cannot consider Mr Aamer’s case because although he is a legal resident of this country, he does not have full British citizenship.","Shaker Aamer has been held without charge for the past 13 years .

"A woman was jailed today for fleecing her grandmother out of her £140,000 life savings and using the cash to fund a lavish lifestyle of luxury cars, new clothes, exotic holidays and £10,000 on a single spa trip. Katie Gosley-Shaw, 38, stripped Ruth Gosley, 89, of money left to her by her late husband, leaving her unable to afford heating or new clothes. Mother-of-two Gosley-Shaw, from Tockwith, York, was jailed for four years after she was found guilty of five counts of theft and two of fraud committed between 2009 and 2012 after a trial last year. Katie Gosley-Shaw (right) was found guilty of five counts of theft and two of fraud for fleecing her grandma Ruth Gosley (left) out of her £140,000 life savings . Gosley-Shaw, who carried out four years of deceit and theft - while at the same time claiming state benefits - had purchased a flashy BMW, foreign holidays, hotel stays, new dresses and run several credit cards. Leeds Crown Court heard today that Gosley-Shaw, who used to work for a hair products company, spent up to £200 a month on petrol and planned to buy a £540,000 house with her partner without needing a mortgage. It was also revealed that Gosley-Shaw spent nearly £10,000 on a single transaction at Feversham Arms health spa in Helmsley, North Yorkshire, and that she also stole two gold necklaces from her grandmother. Before it was stolen by her granddaughter, Mrs Gosley had worn one of the necklaces, which had been a Christmas present  from her late husband, every day for 15 years. Katie Gosley-Shaw was jailed for four years today at Leeds Crown Court . Prosecutor Liam O'Brien told the court that Mrs Gosley was left devastated by the actions of her granddaughter. He said: 'Mrs Gosley said that she had ""broken her heart"". 'She said she couldn't bear the thought of the defendant being sent to prison because of the children.' According to Mr O'Brien, Mrs Gosley's late husband had reassured her she would be cared for after his death. He said: 'He told me ""Don't cry Tosh, you will be all right"" and I was all right because he left me quite a lot of money, but it's vanished. The lot.' During her trial, the granddaughter claimed in the witness box that her grandma had approved each and every transaction, including giving her about £65,000 in a single 'gift' by selling shares. According to Gosley-Shaw, Mrs Gosley also lent her money because she had financial problems following the break-up of her marriage and lived beyond her means. Gosley-Shaw said: 'She is a very, very kind and generous woman.' The grandmother  denied approving any of the transactions. 'Mrs Gosley previously said: 'Katie was here all the time. She would nip in with the kids and we would have a natter. She was here almost daily. 'She was so helpful. She would do anything for me, go to the shops, anything. I adored Katie. 'She was always full of life and liked a good chat. We were good pals. 'If I was down in the dumps she was the one who brought me up. She was very good. 'What happened was a terrible shock. It's unbelievable how it happened. 'If she'd have wanted anything all she had to do was ask and she could have had it.' During sentencing, Judge Rodney Jameson QC told Gosley-Shaw: 'You stole from your grandmother who by the end of matters was in her late eighties. 'She thought that you were the epitome of modern, glamorous living. 'She was speaking highly of you. In many respects finding it difficult to reconcile with the person she had known until then to the person you had been over the past four years.' Judge Jameson added: 'You did not need to do what you did. This was not in my judgement a case where necessary or significant pressure played any part in this offence. 'In contrast, the theft left your grandmother virtually penniless, living on a state pension. 'It is about as mean as an offence as is possible to imagine.'

"Official crime rates and hospital figures give an insight into drug abuse across the US, but the data Google reaps can also reveal just how prevalent the spread of an illicit substance truly is. A team of researchers used Google Trends, which tracks trending topics  over time, to see how the popularity of different drugs has changed in the country over the past decade. It found that searches for crystal meth are steadily rising, heroin is considered an ‘epidemic’ in Pennsylvania, and prescription drugs such as Xanax and Adderall dominate the south. Witdrawal.net used Google Trends to track the popularity of drug searches since 2004 (pictured), including methamphetamine, cocaine, Xanax, Adderall and heroin. Between 2004 and 2008, the popularity of cocaine and meth is shown. From 2006, searches for heroin increased in Maryland and Utah, in particular . The graphics were created by detox and rehab site Withdrawal.net. A team of researchers used the trending tool to track the popularity of drug searches since 2004, including methamphetamine (crystal meth), cocaine, Xanax, Adderall and heroin. The team then plotted the most searched for drugs across the US. Between 2004 and 2008, the popularity of cocaine and methamphetamine (meth) is shown across the US, with states switching between the two over the course of each year. Meth and LSD are searched for more than any other drugs in Los Angeles, California, according to figures from Withdrawal.net and Google Trends. Since Colorado legalised the recreational use of marijuana in 2012, cannabis-related searches have risen in Denver. In Pennsylvania, heroin is the most popular drug. In Massachusetts, the most searches are made for Suboxone - an opiate replacement drug. In March last year, Dr Richard Ng was charged with illegally prescribing the drug, which may explain a surge in searches. Adderall is most commonly searched for ij New Orleans. Cocaine is the most prolific drug in New York. OxyContin and magic mushrooms are popular in Seattle. Painkiller oxycodone is popular in Virginia. And people in Florida search for MDMA. Methamphetamine was reported as one of the most commonly abused drugs during the 2000s, and with a lower street price and a more intense high, meth surpassed cocaine as it swept across middle America. From 2006, searches for heroin increased in Maryland and Utah, in particular. Searches for Xanax first appeared in around 2009, and grew in popularity until around 2012, when they dipped, before rising again a year later. In 2010, Adderall, a prescription stimulant, became a popular substance of abuse. After its 2005 to 2006 peak, interest in meth then once again soared. In particular, 2013 and 2014 were the years when searches for meth took over the US, especially the west, while Adderall dominated the eastern states. And as addictive prescription painkillers have become more tightly regulated, heroin has become an increasingly popular substitute in Pennsylvania and Oregon. Another graph shows that cocaine has consistently been the most searched for drug across the US for the past decade. Adderall was the only drug that came close to the number of cocaine searches between 2011 and 2012. Heroin was steadily searched for from 2004 until 2011, at which point searches began to rise and peaked in 2014. Meth and LSD are searched for more than any other drugs in Los Angeles, California (pictured). Since Colorado legalised the recreational use of marijuana in 2012, cannabis-related searches have risen in Denver. In Pennsylvania, heroin is the most popular drug, and cocaine is popular in New York . This graph shows that cocaine has consistently been the most searched for drug across the US for the past decade. Adderall was the only drug that came close to the number of cocaine searches between 2011 and 2012. Heroin was steadily searched for from 2004 until 2011, at which point searches rose, and peaked in 2014 . The information used to create the graphs came from Google Trends, which tells users the relative popularity over time of searches for up to five different search phrases. For the GIF, the researchers found the most searched substance in each state for every month since January 2004 by limiting the view in Google Trends to that state. They then manually recorded which terms or phrases had the highest score for each month. States that didn't have enough search volume during certain months were labelled 'N/A'. To identify the top cities for each search term in Google Trends, the team looked at the Regional Interest section, filtered by city for each substance, and recorded the city with the highest regional interest score. These scores are not based on the total search volume from that city, but instead reflect search volume per capita. At the height of the meth epidemic in 2005 and 2006, it was the single most searched for drug in dozens of states. The chart also shows that searches for all the drugs studied have been rising since the end of 2009, except cocaine which decreased in popularity, rose in 2012, before dropping again. Searches for the anxiety medication Xanax have also risen throughout the midwest and south, at the same time that Xanax-related hospital visits have doubled across the country over the past six years. The researchers also plotted the most popular searches for specific drugs in select states. For example, meth and LSD are searched for more than any other drugs in Los Angeles, California. Since Colorado legalised the recreational use of marijuana in 2012, cannabis-related searches have risen in Denver. In Pennsylvania, heroin is the most popular drug, while in Massachusetts, the most searches are made for Suboxone - an opiate replacement drug.

"Supply teacher Christine Page, 57, has been banned from the classroom for the rest of the year after a £6,000 council tax and housing benefit scam . A benefits cheat supply teacher has been banned from the classroom for the rest of the year after a £6,000 council tax and housing benefit scam. Christine Page, 57, wrongly claimed housing and council tax benefit while being paid as a supply teacher to cover for other staff at Penally Primary School in Tenby, West Wales. A disciplinary hearing was told Page was expected to be a 'role model' at school, which has since become the Penally Centre for children with behavioural difficulties, but instead fraudulently claimed £6,860 in benefits. The General Teaching Council for Wales heard that she had been given a £5,249 pay out after she was made redundant in 2007. She was later convicted at Swansea Crown after being found guilty of failing to declare this money to Pembrokeshire County Council. When she was sentenced in January 2012, Page was given a community order, requiring her to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. She has since got a new job as a cover supervisor at another school. A disciplinary panel, sitting in Cardiff, heard Page had falsely claimed benefits for three years. Case presenter Rhiannon Dale said: 'Teachers are expected to provide pupils with a moral compass'. 'This is not a matter of a trivial offence - the behaviour lasted over a three and a half year period and resulted in a considerable loss of public funds.' 'Her actions have been inconsistent with those expected of a registered teacher and could bring the profession into disrepute.' The committee imposed a suspension order, specifying that her name will be removed from the teaching register until August 31. This means she will not be able to teach until the next school year.

"Rupert Murdoch has backtracked on Twitter after making a controversial series of tweets in the wake of last week's Paris attacks . Rupert Murdoch has backtracked on Twitter after making a controversial series of tweets in the wake of last week's Paris attacks. The media mogul sparked outrage on Friday after saying all Muslims should be held responsible for the actions of jihadists. On Wednesday Murdoch took to Twitter once again but this time attempted to walk back from his comments which had caused controversy days before in the wake of three days of terrorist atrocities in Paris. 'Certainly did not mean all Muslims responsible for Paris attack, ' he tweeted. 'But Muslim community must debate and confront extremism.' Two minutes later he tweeted again: 'Ten of thousands of jihadi victims are Muslims and millions fighting back. But important for people of all faiths to address the threat.' The News Corp boss' latest tweets had a far less inflammatory tone than that which he had adopted in the aftermath of the attacks. On Friday he had suggested that even peaceful Muslims must take responsibility for the actions of terrorists until the 'jihadist cancer' is destroyed. He wrote: 'Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.' He had then attempted to maintain his hardline stance, telling more than 500,000 followers that 'political correctness' made for 'denial and hypocrisy'. He added: 'Big jihadist danger looming everywhere from Philippines to Africa to Europe to US. 'Political correctness makes for denial and hypocrisy.' Murdoch's latest tweets have a far less inflammatory tone than that which he had adopted after last week's attacks . Murdoch  words sparked a storm on the social network, with many Muslim users outraged that he had appeared to lay the blame for the terrorist attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket on an entire religion, which has more than one billion followers.

"The BBC tries to write off women over 50 as ‘barking’ and employees are afraid to speak out because of a culture of bullying, a former journalist has claimed. Lifting the lid on the culture of sexist ageism at the Corporation, Olenka Frenkiel told peers she feared her bosses would ‘try to paint me mad’ when she challenged the redundancy notice she was served with after entering her mid-50s. The damning comments are made in evidence to a House of Lords inquiry into the representation of women in the broadcast media. The inquiry report, due to be published tomorrow, is expected to say the BBC should do more to ensure older women appear on TV. Scroll down for video . Olenka Frenkiel told peers that BBC bosses tried to paint her 'as mad' when she challenged her redundancy . Critics say it is wrong that elderly male presenters such as David Dimbleby, aged 76, are given prestigious roles such as fronting the BBC’s election coverage, while women over 50 are rarely seen on its shows. The issue of ageism at the BBC first came to prominence four years ago when former Countryfile host Miriam O’Reilly won a discrimination case against the broadcaster. And in written evidence to the inquiry, published on the committee’s website, Miss Frenkiel said she was forced out of the BBC for being too old, despite her award-winning track record over 30 years there. She refused to sign a gagging clause after she was told in 2011 she was facing compulsory redundancy. ‘I feared the BBC would try to destroy my character as I had seen them do to others,’ she said. ‘Older women are routinely diminished with single words; “barking” or “impossible”.’ Miriam O'Reilly, pictured, won a discrimination case against the BBC after she was dropped from Country File . Employees are ‘frightened to speak’, she said, because of ‘covert methods the BBC uses against its own staff’. Miss Frenkiel said a Radio 4 programme on the issue of women at the Corporation was ‘editorially corrupt’, as it gave space to comedian Rowan Atkinson to attack the tribunal’s judgment against the BBC even though Miss O’Reilly was not on the programme. Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘As we explained to the House of Lords committee last year, nearly half of the BBC’s news and current affairs workforce is female with 37.3 per cent in leadership positions in network news and 35.1 per cent in global news and we have a large number of on-air and management positions filled by women in news. ‘We’re addressing the imbalance on-air and off-air.’","Olenka Fenkiel told peers the BBC made her redundant in her mid 50s .

"Celebrity Big Brother exile Ken Morley acted like a 'professional pervert' who deliberately fluffed lines during the filming of a double glazing advert so he could 'slap' a model's bottom, it was claimed today. Sarah Whitefoot said working with the 'creepy' former Coronation Street star, 71, was torture because he 'couldn't take his eyes off my cleavage'. The actor was thrown off Celebrity Big Brother this week for using 'unacceptable language' including the repeated use of the word 'negro' and saying two female housemates had 'the best a**** he's ever seen'. Model Ms Whitefoot, who is married with a son, claims he treated her like a sexual object and 'within minutes of meeting me he (Morley) was putting his arm round me and slapping my bum'. Scroll down for video . Fresh claims: Model Sarah Whitefoot says that Ken Morley had slapped her bottom during the filming of a double glazing advert . Facing the public: Morley told presenters and viewers of Loose Women yesterday he was not sexist or racist . Sarah Whitefoot claims filming with Ken Morley was terrible because he was ogling and touching her . She also says the filming of the short Safestyle UK double glazing advert in 2002 needed an extraordinary 20 takes, which she believes was deliberate so he could spend more time touching her. She told The Sun's Ruth Warrander: 'He was a professional pervert — as though as this was the way he normally acted, as if it was acceptable. I was clearly just an object to him. It was quite sinister really. 'He was putting his hands round my waist, cuddling me and patting my bum'. Ms Whitefoot says she put up with his behaviour because 'he was famous' and she was 'trying to get my acting career off the ground'. Despite earning almost £1,000 from the advert she said she asked never to work with Morley again. She said she was pleased he was thrown off the Channel 5 show because: 'I am just so glad he has been exposed for who he really is'. Yesterday the actor faced the public for the first time since his controversial comments, but insisted he was not racist or sexist. The 71-year-old actor repeatedly clashed with his housemates and was evicted from the show for using 'unacceptable language' including  use of the word 'negro' in a conversation about former Boxer Frank Bruno. Prior to leaving the house, Morley, who had already received a final warning after he branded US singer Alexander O'Neal a 'nice big fat negro'. He was called to the diary room immediately and told to leave after describing a row he had with boxer  Bruno, where he again used the racist term. In a discussion with Keith Chegwin, he recalled the conversation he had with Bruno, where he told the boxing legend: 'Hello, Lord Fauntleroy here - turn down your negro rhythms.' Early exit: The actor arrives home  after being thrown off CBB for his 'offensive' language . Morley, who appeared in pantomime in Bradford with the former boxer in 1996, recalled the conversation he had with Bruno, where he told the sportsman: 'Hello, Lord Fauntleroy here - turn down your negro rhythms' Morley, who played  Reg Holdsworth in Coronation Street for a decade, told presenters and viewers of ITV's Loose Women that he apologised 'unreservedly' for his behaviour, and maintained he was not racist, but had used an 'outdated expression' He also refused to apologise for his comments deemed by many of his female housemates to be sexist, instead complaining of their 'provocative' clothing, and incidents he said were cut from the show. Rather than saying sorry for causing offence by referring to house mate Cami Li as a 'slut' or for saying both Li and Page Three girl Chloe Goodman, 21, have some of 'the best a**** he's ever seen', he instead claimed producers had edited out bad behaviour from some of the other contestants. Pressed again on whether his comments had been sexist he replied that some of the women housemates from America had been wearing 'provocative' clothes. 'In the context of the show, the ladies from America, they work in various aspects of the entertainment industry. One does a transsexual act and part of that is to dress in provocative clothes. 'When they arrived here they insisted on wearing the most daring clothes they could get away with.' Former Coronation Street star Ken Morley was called to the diary house immediately after describing a row he had with Frank Bruno, where he used a racist term, and was told to leave . Singer Jamelia then put to Morley that his comments had made the female housemates feel uncomfortable, saying: 'You didn't care about offending people'. He was told his comments had offended hundreds of viewers, but replied 'I don't know the people who have been upset'.

"Stephen Collins, pictured with his estranged wife Faye Grant in 2009, had a court date set on Wednesday in LA to begin divorce proceedings . 7th Heaven star Stephen Collins was in court with his estranged wife on Wednesday to set a date for what is likely to be a bitter divorce battle. The disgraced soap star stood side by side with Faye Grant in the LA Court as the judge set February 9 as the date for proceedings to begin. The former actor has admitted he inappropriately touched one minor on one occasion in 1973 then went on to expose himself to two other underage girls between then and 1994. According to TMZ, the couple are due to meet next week to discuss a settlement and avoid court - which will no doubt see Collins' molestation charges brought up by lawyers when discussing Ms Grant's assets and payout. Collins said he had molested three girls, in a taped confession leaked to TMZ allegedly by his soon-to-be ex-wife. The tape was made during a marriage counseling session with his wife, where he and the therapist were taped without their knowledge. The couple of nearly 30 years filed for divorce in 2012 but have been engaged in a heated legal battle over how to split their assets. Grant, who is also an actress, is fighting for high spousal support payments of $13,000 a month, saying she is no longer able to make a living from her career when she took a break to raise their daughter. She also said she only released the taped confession to police, when Collins allegedly denied to seek treatment for his issues. She denied ever turning the audio over to TMZ. In an interview last month with 20/20's Katie Couric, Collins claimed that it was a scarring incident in his childhood that planted his 'exhibitionist urges'. 'I did have someone in my life when I was between the ages of about 10 and 15, an older woman, who repeatedly exposed herself to me,' Collins said. 'And I think that distorted my perception in such a way that some part of me thought... I got the equation of, ""Well, this isn’t so terrible. This person who I trust is doing it.""' The 67-year-old actor insisted 'this is not an excuse' but through therapy 'it makes the most sense to me' as a trigger for his actions. 'There was a power that she had over me that was intense. … It’s also about a very distorted form of approval,' he said. Scroll down for video . Collins was best known for playing Reverend Eric Camden on 7th Heaven (left). Reports about his indiscretions first came to light in October when his estranged wife Faye Grant (pictured together-right) released a taped confession that was obtained TMZ. The couple begin court proceedings next month . One of Collins' alleged victims, who is in her 50s, told TMZ that Collins gain sexual gratification during the alleged incident and ejaculated while making her touch him inappropriately. Collins has previously said  'there was no gratification' during the three encounters he had - calling them an 'impulsive act' that's 'haunted' him ever since. The woman told TMZ: 'Stephen is minimizing the incident. It was not just a spontaneous touching... that aggression resulted in him ejaculating.' She also slammed his decision not to apologize to her and another girl he targeted. She added: 'His assertion that he wanted to avoid reopening an old wound seems nonsensical to me.' She has filed a police report with the NYPD  - although it's believed any case would be rejected because of the statute of limitations. The woman adds: 'Why isn't he donating any disposable income, beyond what he needs to survive, to a child-abuse charity? Maybe he should at least try apologizing to his victims.' Collins - who is being investigated by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department on molestation allegations but has not been charged with any crime - said that while his actions were 'terrible', he does not fit the definition of a pedophile. 'A pedophile is someone who is mainly or wholly attracted to children. I'm not,' he told Couric. 'I had a distortion in my thinking where I acted out in those ways. 'But I'm absolutely not attracted, physically or sexually attracted to children. I'm just not.' The actor added that he has 'big boundary issues', but stressed he is not a sexual predator. When pressed by Katie Couric during an interview in December on reports that he was also attracted to young boys, Collins said he has never felt such urges. According to Collins, the first incident occurred in 1973, when a girl had come to visit and stay with him and his first wife. After his wife had gone to sleep, he and the girl were watching TV together. 'I took her hand and moved it in such a way that she was touching me inappropriately,' he said. 'I knew that something unthinkably wrong had just happened that I couldn't take back.' He also said he exposed himself to a teenage girl in 1982 and another in 1994. He said he has had no such urges since 1994.' Collins said he's been in treatment and religious counseling for 20 years. 'I'm a human being with flaws,' he said. 'I have dealt with them very, very strongly and commitedly in my private life.' Collins first admitted to the three incidents in a lengthy confessional essay for People magazine. None of his victims have ever publicly came forward. In the public backlash to the TMZ tapes, Collins lost parts on TV show Scandal and in the sequel to the movie Ted, while re-runs of 7th Heaven were pulled from the air. 'Forty years ago, I did something terribly wrong that I deeply regret. I have been working to atone for it ever since,' Collins wrote in People. 7th Heaven was a show about a pastor and his wife, raising their large brood of seven children. A young Jessica Biel (to Collins' right in a blue sweater) played the couple's eldest daughter. Collins says he never behaved inappropriately toward any of the young actresses on the show . He says he's decided to speak publicly about the reports because he believes some of his actions have been elaborated. 'On the recording, I described events that took place 20, 32, and 40 years ago,' Collins adds. 'The publication of the recording has resulted in assumptions and innuendos about what I did that go far beyond what actually occurred. As difficult as this is, I want people to know the truth.' Collins says he was 25-years-old during the first incident in 1973. He says he exposed himself to the girl twice before, but took things to another level on the visit. 'It lasted less than a minute, during which there was no gratification,' Collins said. 'I then left the room. I had no further physical contact with her. It was a completely impulsive act and it's haunted me ever since to think of what I put her through.' Over the next two decades, Collins says he continued to expose himself to two more teenage girls, once in 1982 and again in 1994. 'The first instance lasted second and the second about a minute,' Collins says of the indecent exposure. 'I had no physical contact of any kind with either girl. I don't say this to excuse what I did - it was inexcusable - but to clarify what actually happened.' Collins says the exposure in 1994 was his 'rock bottom' and what caused him to finally seek help for his deviant behavior. For the past 20 years, Collins says he's been undergoing therapy and religious counseling, while praying and meditating every day. These treatments, Collins claims, have worked and kept him from harming other young girls. 'Since that day in 1994, I have not had an impulse to act out in any such way.' Collins has only apologized directly to one of his victims, who he says was 'extraordinary gracious', but has not reached out to the others for fear that he will be 'opening old wounds'. Collins says the release of the tapes in October led to confusion over when he exposed himself to the young girls, and if it was possible one of his young co-stars on 7th Heaven was a victim. 'I appeared for eleven seasons on a television series with a cast that included minor females in our TV family, and countless other young actresses throughout the show's eleven years. I never behaved inappropriately on or off that set - or on any set I've ever worked on.' When the tapes were first released, law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles said they were investigating the claims. But law enforcement sources who spoke with TMZ said that despite the taped confession, they felt Collins would not be charged and 'the cases will go nowhere'. Los Angeles police investigated him in 2012 and reviewed their case in October but a spokeswoman said Friday there were no updates on its status. Los Angeles Sheriff's Department detectives also opened an investigation into Collins over an early 1980s incident, but as of Friday had not presented their case to prosecutors.","The disgraced soap star, 67, stood side by side with estranged wife Faye Grant, 57, in the LA Court on Wednesday .

During an appearance on The Meredith Vieira Show on Wednesday, the Duchess of York said: '[Diana] would have just been the naughtiest, funniest and the best ever just because she loved her boys so much and she would be so proud of all of them and what they've achieved.'

'They really are extraordinary boys and Catherine is incredible. I just think it is all goodness and we need to hear more about goodness and Diana would have loved that,' she said. While the Duchess could not confirm rumors that William and Kate plan to name their second child after Princess Diana, who died in 1997, she had plenty to say on how the couple are handling life in the spotlight. 'I believe in love. I believe in just that goodness of love and I think they are a beautiful example of a great family, totally in love and with that delicious little George, so squishy, you know you want to eat him,' she said.

She also shot down allegations that her ex-husband had sexual relations with an underage girl; Prince Andrew has come under fire over his friendship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who has been accused in court documents of supplying the royal with the minor in question. Virginia Roberts - now said to be a married mother-of-three in her 30s - alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince when she was a minor' in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein.

'I don’t understand in this day and age how people could make salacious lies up and how the media can then write about it, and then follow on with it because I just don’t understand. This is defamation of character, of a person that is the opposite of how he’s being portrayed. 'Buckingham Palace put out a denial on his behalf, that’s how it works within the Royal family. They stand by that denial. There is nothing more to be said.' She made similar statements while on the Today show yesterday, telling Matt Lauer: 'I won't stand by and have his character defamed.

"Director Roman Polanski (pictured) has said he will cooperate with Polish police procedures after he the U.S. requested his extradition . Polish prosecutors have questioned filmmaker Roman Polanski following a U.S. request for his extradition over a 1977 child sex crime conviction. The questioning took place in Krakow, southern Poland and local prosecutors are likely to issue a statement on Thursday, it was reported. It was revealed last week the U.S. has asked Poland to extradite the 81-year-old filmmaker over the historical child sex crime conviction. Following last week's extradition request, a lawyer for Polanski - viewed by many Poles as one of their greatest living cultural figures - said Polish prosecutors already questioned Polanski last year and let him go free, and since then nothing had changed. Polanski has also stated he hopes Poland would not extradite him, but he would submit himself 'to the procedure, and we will see,' TVN24 reported. He added: 'I have confidence in Poland's justice system.' Polanski, who was born to Polish parents but lives in France, has been spending time in the southern Polish city of Krakow, where he is planning to shoot a film. In October last year, prosecutors in Krakow interviewed Polanski in connection with a U.S. warrant over the 1977 conviction. They said there were no grounds to arrest him, and they would await a U.S. extradition request before deciding on any further steps. 'In our view no new circumstances have arisen which could lead to a change in the decision by the prosecutor's office in October,' one of Polanski's Polish lawyers, Jerzy Stachowicz, said. The filmmaker pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old during a photoshoot in Los Angeles, fuelled by champagne and drugs. Polanski served 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea bargain but fled the United States the following year, believing the judge hearing his case could overrule the deal and put him in jail for years. In 2009, Polanski was arrested in the Swiss city of Zurich on the U.S. warrant and placed under house arrest. He was freed  after Swiss authorities decided not to extradite him to the U.S. His lawyers have been seeking assurances from the Polish authorities that he can travel freely back and forth to Krakow to work on the film project, about the 19th-century Dreyfus affair, without risking another arrest. Paris-born Polanski spent his childhood and youth in Poland but lives in France. He holds Polish and French passports. Roman Polanski pictured during the making of his 2002 Holocaust film The Pianist . Roman Polanski was born in Paris to Polish parents, but moved back to his parents' home country just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. After having survived the Holocaust as a young boy, and having grown up and educated in Poland, he began directing films. Some of those, including The Pianist and Chinatown, have gone on to become hugely successful, and have won numerous Academy Awards. In 1969, his pregnant wife Sharon Tate was killed in the Manson Family murders which rocked Hollywood. After the two had married the previous year, Polanski was working in London when the group of killers - at the beckoning of cult leader Charles Manson - broke into their Los Angeles mansion, killing Tate, the couple's unborn baby, and four of her friends. In 1969, members of Charles Manson's (pictured left) cult broke into the home of Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate (right) and murdered the heavily pregnant actress and four of her friends . Coroners later found the bodies had been in some instances mutilated, with dozens of stab wounds and messages on the house left written in the victims' blood. In the years following, Polanski continued directing and made perhaps his most widely-regarded film to date - 1974's Chinatown, starring a young Jack Nicholson. In 1977, after Polanski pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old  during a photoshoot in Los Angeles, he has lived his life outside the U.S. After  serving 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea bargain, he fled to France, believing the judge hearing his case could overrule the deal and put him in jail for years. Last year he was arrested by Swiss police at the behest of U.S. authorities - however,  attempts to extradite him were unsuccessful.","Polish authorities question Roman Polanski following extradition request .

"Suicide: An autopsy report has confirmed that director Tony Scott killed himself in August . Filmmaker Tony Scott had anti-depressants and sleeping pills when he killed himself by jumping off a bridge in August, an autopsy report revealed on Monday. The report by the Los Angeles County coroner confirmed that the Top Gun director's death was a suicide, and listed the cause of death as multiple blunt force injuries. It said that he also drowned after leaping from the Vincent Thomas Bridge into Los Angeles harbour on August 19. Scott had therapeutic levels of the anti-depressant Remeron and the sleep aid Lunesta in his system when he died, the report has revealed. It has long been assumed that the director had killed himself, as he left a number of apparent suicide notes in his car when he died. However, the notes did not suggest any motive for the suicide, and his death certificate did not initially list a cause. Initial reports that he had been suffering from terminal brain cancer have now been confirmed to be incorrect. 'There was no evidence of neoplasia - cancer - identified,' coroner Craig Harvey told the Los Angeles Times. He added that Scott did not appear to have been suffering from any serious long-term illness at all. 911 tapes released earlier this month revealed that at least five female motorists reported seeing  Scott leap to his death. The 68-year-old filmmaker committed suicide by jumping off Vincent . Thomas Bridge, linking the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, in broad . daylight on August 19 in full view of boaters and passing drivers. Disheveled: Scott was pictured looking pained as he dined out in Beverly Hills on July 23 . ‘We are just on the Vincent Thomas . Bridge and there’s a guy that looks like he’s just about to jump off … . he’s jumped, he’s jumped, [off] the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro!’ said one 911 caller. Another witness reported the fatal . leap to 911 operators, and was then transferred to a fire dispatcher. During the transfer, she could be heard gasping: ‘Oh my God.’ The caller said: ‘He was a bald white guy. Oh my gosh, he just jumped off the bridge. We actually witnessed the whole thing.’ Motorists driving over the bridge . reported seeing a black Toyota Prius, lights still flashing, parked on . the side, as an older white male climbed a pole before leaping more than . 185 feet into the water. Scott had been preparing to do a sequel to his 1986 Tom Cruise hit Top Gun. He and Cruise were spotted in Fallon, . Nevada — where the Navy’s Top Gun program had been based before moving . to San Diego — meeting with Navy officials, a week before the suicide. Unclear: His death certificate initially failed to list a cause of death for the well-known director . Coroner's office spokesman Ed Winter . says one of the notes left in Scott's black Toyota Prius was a list of . emergency contact numbers and another found in his study included . messages to friends and loved ones. The note in the car listed names and . contact numbers - including that of his wife - so police could call his . friends to tell them of his death, TMZ reported. Brother: Ridley Scott is pictured here at his office in West Hollywood in the days following his brothers death . The mystery surrounding the suicide . deepened after the chairman of 20th Century Fox said that the director . was 'burning with excitement' over new projects just two weeks before . his suicide. 'We had a meeting just two weeks ago . and he was burning with the excitement of creating stuff,' said Tom . Rothman. Scott had more big-budget Hollywood . films lined up, but his death has left them in limbo, as well as . stunning his family and friends. Friends of the director said that he . had no marriage or money problems and was focused on the 'Top Gun' sequel which was preparing to go into production early next year. Scott was also in pre-production on . an underwater drug-trafficking thriller 'Narco-Sub', another smuggling . drama 'Lucky Strike' and a remake of the 1969 western 'The Wild Bunch'. While celebrity website TMZ reported . that Scott's wife didn't know of any serious illness that may have been a . motive, it raised the possibility that the director of Crimson Tide . may have kept his illness secret. If not there must have been a . different reason behind his decision to leap from the Vincent Thomas . Bridge in Long Beach on Sunday afternoon. He left a contact list of people to . be informed about the tragedy in the Toyota Prius he abandoned before . climbing a fence and jumping into the Pacific. The director was said to have leaped to his death 'without hesitation' in an effort to spare his family the pain of watching his slow death, . ABC News reported. But hours later, ABC backed away from that report and the Los Angeles Times confirmed that Scott's family told the corner's office Scott did not have cancer - or any major illness. 'The . family told us it is incorrect that he has inoperable brain cancer,' Craig Harvey, a chief at the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office told . the newspaper. Tragic: Los Angeles polie officers pulled the body of Tony Scott from the water beneath the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro, California . The denial of his brain cancer begs the question - what could have driven the successful director, whose . films have grossed more than $2 billion and who left behind a young family, to kill himself? Tony Scott's tragic death came just . weeks after he was pictured looking pained as he left a Beverly Hills . restaurant on July 23 - but friends denied he had problems in his . marriage to wife Donna. A source told the New York Post: 'He did have . cancer, and for a while he was cancer free. He didn’t have any money . problems or marriage problems.' The beloved filmmaker, who . directed movies including Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop II and Enemy Of . The State and was the younger brother of director Ridley Scott,  fell within feet of a cruise boat as horrified tourists watched. 'He landed right next to our tour boat, and many . of us saw the whole thing,' a witness, who had been on the cruise around the Los Angeles Harbour, told TMZ. According to the Contra Costa Times, Scott climbed a fence on the south side of the bridge, which spans San Pedro and Terminal Island, and leaped off 'without hesitation'.

'He was on the roadway close to the fence looking around. He was looking around and fumbling with something at his feet. He looked nervous,' David Silva told the Los Angeles Times. Silva thought he was a stuntman or taking part in an extreme sports event - until he realised there was no safety cord. He went on: '[He] paused a couple of seconds and then began . to climb the fence. He put his foot on the top of the fence and paused . again. Then he threw himself off. I immediately thought, that guy is . dead.' Friends told the New York Post they were not surprised that the director chose to leap to his death as he was a thrill-seeker who loved scaling high mountains.

"Two months ago, convicted murderer Jodi Arias went in front of jurors and pleaded to be spared the death penalty for the brutal killing of her ex-boyfriend. However, a judge's ruling allowed her to testify in secret and sealed her words from the public. Transcripts of that testimony were released Tuesday, weeks  after an appeals court threw out a judge's decision to bar the public from the courtroom while Arias was on the stand. At the time, the judge explained the witness, whose name was then kept secret, was skittish and wouldn't testify in public. The release of the transcripts came after news organizations protested the closure. Scroll down for video . Jodi Arias sits during her sentencing phase retrial in Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix on January 9 . Arias was convicted last year in the 2008 death of Travis Alexander (above) Dwane Cates, a criminal defense attorney in Phoenix who isn't involved in the Arias case, believes the courtroom was likely closed in hopes of preventing the case from becoming an even bigger media spectacle than it already was. He doubted the request was granted just to appease Arias. 'It had to do a lot with I think everybody wanted it closed,' Cates said. Arias was convicted last year in the 2008 death of Travis Alexander, but jurors deadlocked on her punishment. A new jury has been hearing testimony since mid-October over whether she should be sentenced to life in prison or death. Prosecutors said Arias attacked Alexander in a jealous rage after he wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman. Arias has acknowledged killing Alexander but claimed it was self-defense after he attacked her. Despite her reservations about testifying during the sentencing retrial, Arias has actively courted the spotlight since she was arrested in 2008. She did interviews on TV's 48 Hours and Inside Edition""after her arrest and was on the witness stand for several weeks during her criminal trial. She also did a series of media interviews after the jury convicted her of murder. Her lawyer Kirk Nurmi is quoted in the transcript as saying he was concerned about the media getting hold of the transcript. Despite her reservations about testifying during the sentencing retrial, Arias has actively courted the spotlight since she was arrested in 2008, appearing on countless news programs . As she did in her first trial, Arias said in the most recent testimony that she was raised by physically abusive parents and faced a string of failed romantic relationships in early adulthood. She also detailed the early days of her relationship with Alexander, including their first sexual encounters and bonding over religion. Her testimony was halted after the appeals court overruled the unusual decision by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens to let Arias testify in private. Prosecutor Juan Martinez didn't get a chance to question her then, though he did so at her criminal trial. It's unknown whether Arias will take the stand again. She led off her latest testimony by acknowledging that she killed Alexander and voiced regret at the pain she caused his family. 'I wish so badly that I could just take that away from them, and that I could reverse what I did,' Arias said. The sentencing retrial, which had been expected to end in mid-December, is scheduled to resume Wednesday.","Convicted murderer Jodi Arias' testimony at her sentencing retrial revealed few new details about her actions in killing her former boyfriend .

"An over-the-counter painkiller used by millions will no longer be sold in pharmacies from today, over fears that it could raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Diclofenac pills will now only be available with a prescription. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said the painkilling and anti-inflammatory tablets, widely bought under the brand name Voltarol, carry a ‘small but increased’ risk of heart problems. Diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug, has been reclassified by the UK healthcare regulator as a prescription-only medicine after concerns it may cause heart problems for some patients . Painkilling gels that contain diclofenac will still be available over the counter, however. Diclofenac accounts for six million prescriptions, and it is thought that tens of thousands buy Voltarol directly over the counter. The pills are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are used to relieve pain caused by conditions including arthritis, gout, headaches and flu. In 2013, Oxford University researchers found high doses of NSAIDs can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. A review by European health officials confirmed the finding, and said patients should no longer use diclofenac if they have a heart condition, or have previously suffered heart attacks or strokes. Diclofenac - the active ingredient in Voltarol – offers fast relief from pain and inflammation associated with back, neck and muscle aches. It also gives short-term relief from headaches, toothache, period pain and cold and flu symptoms. It blocks a substance in the body called cyclo-oxygenase, which produces chemicals in response to injury – causing pain, swelling and inflammation. In 2013, a major Oxford University study found that for every 1,000 people with a moderate risk of heart disease taking 150mg a day for a year, about three would experience an avoidable heart attack, of which one would be fatal. Diclofenac can also cause serious side-effects in the gut, such as ulceration, bleeding or perforation of the stomach or intestinal lining. The MHRA’s Commission on Human Medicines concluded that these side-effects could ‘not be ruled out’ even at lower doses, or when diclofenac is taken for a short time. Pills containing diclofenac remain available over the counter in many other countries, including Germany, Italy and Australia. However, the MHRA’s Sarah Branch said: ‘Diclofenac is associated with a small but increased risk of serious cardiac side effects in some patients, particularly if used at high doses and for long-term treatment. Because of this, the Commission on Human Medicines has advised that patients need to have a medical review before taking oral diclofenac to make sure it is suitable for them. ‘If patients have recently bought diclofenac tablets and continue to need pain relief they should talk to their pharmacist about suitable alternative treatments.’ Dr Branch said those prescribed diclofenac by a doctor should continue to take their medicine as instructed, as their medical history has already been assessed. Dr Phil Berry, head of clinical safety at Voltarol manufacturer Novartis, warned: ‘Those who want to continue taking oral diclofenac are now going to have to go to their GP which, in view of the current situation in the UK with A&E, is worrying.’ Six million prescriptions were written for diclofenac last year and the drug is also available over the counter in lower dose Voltarol tablets and cream .","Diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug, has been reclassified .

"A maths student who started university just three months ago has died of a suspected allergic reaction after a meal in a burger bar. Shahida Shahid, 18, was taken to intensive care after she collapsed in Manchester city centre on Friday night. She died three days later. Police have launched a joint investigation with the Food Standards Agency as friends of the teenager said she was 'beautiful, brilliant and kind'. Meal: Miss Shahid, who started university just three months ago, ate at this branch of trendy burger restaurant Almost Famous in Manchester's Great Northern Warehouse. She then collapsed half a mile away . Miss Shahid, a first-year student at the University of Manchester, collapsed at 8.30pm on Friday after eating in the trendy burger restaurant Almost Famous. Unlike many allergic reactions, however, Miss Shahid did not suffer from symptoms immediately. She and friends ate in the city's Great Northern Warehouse shopping centre and paramedics were only called when they reached The Printworks, another shopping centre half a mile away. A  Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: 'At about 8.30pm on Friday, January 9, police were called to Withy Grove in Manchester city centre following reports an 18-year-old woman had collapsed. 'The woman was rushed to hospital but she sadly died on Monday, January 12. 'Initial inquiries have established the woman had been out for a meal in the Northern Quarter prior to her collapse and may have suffered an allergic reaction to her food. 'A joint investigation is currently underway involving Greater Manchester Police and the Food Standards Agency to establish the exact circumstances.' The 18-year-old grew up in Worsley, Greater Manchester, and attended the local Walkden High School and Winstanley College. Her devastated cousin, Farjana Alam, wrote on Facebook the day before Shahida died that she was in intensive care with brain damage. 'Everyone please keep my cousin in your prayers,' she wrote. 'She is in the ICU, has gotten brain damage, and she isn't being responsive - every prayer counts xx.' Following the death, Farjana posted: 'To God we belong and to God we return. My beautiful, brilliant, kind, loving cousin has passed away. 'Please everyone keep her in your prayers - I still cannot believe she's gone and my heart aches with pain that she has left the world. 'May Allah grant her mercy and take her to the highest of Jannah - everyone please pray for her and her family's strength.' Others paid tribute to the teenager on social media. Sophie Ball wrote on Twitter: 'Rip Shahida, you were such a lovely woman and a great best friend to my cousin - you will be deeply missed. Keep shining.' Gemma Woodward posted: 'So much to live for. Rip Shahida xxxxx So, so amazing.' Investigation: The restaurant's management passed on its condolences but said it could not comment further . Another friend, Sophie, wrote: 'So last night I found out that one of my friends was taken off life support few hours ago and sadly passed away. RIP SHAHIDA sadly missed.' Just a month ago the FSA launched new EU rules on how customers should be told about allergens in outlets which don't usually label food, such as restaurants and sandwich bars. Restaurants must now label 14 main substances which can cause an allergic reaction on their menus. They are gluten, fish, shellfish, egg, peanuts, other nuts, soy beans, milk, celery, mustard, sesame seed, sulphur dioxide, lupin and molluscs. Marie Carter, company director of Almost Famous, said: 'We're absolutely devastated to hear the tragic news that this young lady has passed away. Our thoughts are with her family and friends. 'As the authorities are conducting investigations it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.'","Teenager Shahida Shahid collapsed in Manchester city centre on Friday .

"'The Werewolf': Former police officer Mikhail Popkov (pictured) murdered at least 24 women who reportedly looked like his mother . A retired Russian policeman who raped and murdered 22 women after he claimed he wanted to cleanse his Siberian hometown of prostitutes, has been sentenced to life in prison/ . Mikhail Popkov, 50, who worked as a police officer at the time of most of the murders, raped and stabbed two dozen women in the city of Angarsk after offering to give them lifts in his police car, investigators said. Two women managed to survive Popkov's attacks but suffered serious injuries. 'Investigators managed to gather evidence implicating Popkov in 22 murders and two attempted murders of women,' the Investigative Committee said in a statement after his sentencing. The victims' bodies were found dumped in woods, on the roadside and in a cemetery. The victims included a teacher and a shop assistant as well as several prostitutes, Russian media reported. Nicknamed The Werewolf he eluded police for two decades as investigators catastrophically ignored evidence that the mystery killer could be one of their own officers who used his uniform to gain trust. The father of one  selected victims who resembled his mother, say Russian reports of the case, which is centred on Angarsk in the Irkutsk region of Siberia. Police earlier said that of the 29 he was suspected of killing, 25 were aged 19 to 28, and four were from 35 to 40. 'He beheaded at least one woman and gouged the heart out of a victim,' reported The Siberian Times. 'Popkov claimed he suddenly stopped killing after he ""became impotent"", suggesting a sexual motive to his murder spree.  Typically, his victims were slightly intoxicated when he lured them to their deaths. 'He snared them after they had been to bars or parties. He is suspected of seeking revenge on his mother who was an alcoholic and allegedly abused him in his childhood.' Investigators have established his killing spree lasted from 1992 until at least 2000, but have been unable to prove any killings since then. Popkov was finally arrested in June 2012 after around 3,500 police officers, serving and retired, were forced to take DNA tests. He told officers: 'I just felt I wanted to kill a woman I was giving a lift to in my car.' Victim: Viktoria Chagaeva holds a picture of her 20-year-old sister Tanya Martynova, who was killed by Popkov after attending a concert with a friend in 1998 . Friends: The bodies of Yulia Kuprikova (left) and Tanya Martynova were found by a shepherd in an Angarsk suburb in 1998 . Tragedy: Tanya's mother Lubov (pictured with Tanya's daughter) died aged 66 in 2007 after becoming overcome with grief following her daughter's death . The Siberian Times goes on to say: 'He murdered the women with a slipknot, knife, awl, screwdriver or an axe which he used up to 17 times on some victims. 'He used his police uniform and car to gain the trust of at least some of his victims.' One victim, known only as Svetlana M, who escaped his brutal attack when he left her for dead naked in the snow in midwinter. She told how an officer in a police car gave her a lift, then took her to the forest where he forced her to strip before crashing her head against a tree trunk. The police did not investigate properly after Popkov's wife Elena, now 47, who claimed he was a perfect husband and father, gave him an alibi. Innocent: Yulia Kuprikova, who was murdered with her friend Tanya Martynova . She also served in the police, and the couple have a daughter Ekaterina, now 26, a schoolteacher. Former policeman Nikolai Kitaev, who has criticised the handling of the case, said that Svetlana M was shown a picture of Popkov 'and clearly confirmed it was him' but investigators chose to believe Popkov's wife. Kitaev is convinced there are at least a dozen more cases in police files that are likely to be Popkov's victims. Many of the details from the crime scenes match his modus operandi, he said. After leaving the force, Popkov became . a security officer but bought and sold cars on the side, and frequently . travelled to and from Vladivostok on Russia's Pacific coast. 'He had plenty of opportunity for other killings but this has not been checked by police,' said one source. Earlier, . as policed fumbled to find the killer, a detective predicted that they . must be dealing with someone who 'is charming and sociable. Women like . him but he is a beast inside, and it is always hard to fight a . werewolf.' Tatiana (Tanya) Martynova, 20, was found dead with her friend Yulia Kuprikova, 19, on 29 October 1998 in an Angarsk suburb. 'It . happened 15 years ago, but the pain does not go away - it was me who . gave Tanya a ticket to go to a concert, and she was killed after . attending it,' said her sister Viktoria Chagaeva, 46, who owns a beauty . salon in Angarsk. Tanya was married with a child and was having a rare night out. Their bodies were found by a shepherd. 'It was 1am when Tanya's husband Igor and I came to the police,' she said. Murdered: An obituary notice for Maria Molotkova, 20, was found dead in the forest after going missing on 17 August 1999 . Another of Popkov's victims: A police appeal for Yulia Shapovalova after she went missing . 'Igor was absolutely devastated and only repeated - 'She was killed, she was killed'. 'I was shocked too, but I simply could not believe it and replied - 'what are you talking about?' 'Later, we were told that their bodies were found next to each other, both girls were raped, cut and chopped.' Popkov has also been accused of raping the corpses of his victims. Chagaeva added: 'The experts told us that at first they were killed then raped. 'My elder brother Oleg went to the morgue to identify Tanya. He had flown from Moscow immediately. 'He . felt sick when saw the body, she was so mutilated. He was almost green . when he came out of there - he just could not say a word. 'I did not dare to go in and look.' Preyed on: The funeral of friends Marina Lyzhina, 35 (left) and Liliya Pashkovskaya, 37 (right) who were picked up by Popkov in his police car as they were returning from a night out . Cut down in their prime: Marina Lyzhina, 35 and Lilia Pashkovskaya, 37, were buried on 8 June 2000 . After the concert, the two women had been for a drink. Like almost all his victims, he targeted women who had taken alcohol. Their mother Lubov died early, aged 66 in 2007, unable to cope with the trauma, she said. 'She . felt as if she had died with Tanya, life became useless for her. She . lived only because she was visiting various mediums one by one, looking . for the killer and wasting her money. Viktoria Chagaeva . 'Nobody gave her any serious information but she kept doing it.' After . Popkov's arrest last year, Viktoria realised she vaguely knew the . killer. They had both been involved in biathlon at the same sports . ground. 'I was stuck with horror when I saw the picture of this maniac in the paper and online,' she said. 'My sister's killer was looking into my eyes. I immediately felt as if I'd met him. Looking at him, I could hardly breathe. 'Some . minutes later I looked at him another time and thought - oh my God, I . know him. I was so shocked, I even took a knife and cut his face in the . newspaper, I needed to let this horror out of me. 'I remember him as a tall slim man, he was always alone, with a slippery and shifty glance.' Dumping ground: A road near the town of Meget where bodies of Tanya and her friend Yulia were found . Intercepted: The block of flats in Angarsk where Tanya Martynova failed to return after she was targeted by Popkov after attending a concert . Dmitry, . a former police colleague of Popkov's, said: 'When I read about him in . the press I literally choked, because I used to work with him and . thought I knew him. 'He was an absolutely normal man... he liked biathlons... once on duty he shot a rapist during an arrest. There was an investigation and he was not punished, the chiefs considered he had taken fair action.' Angarsk psychiatrist Alexander Grishin said: 'The fact that only drunk women attracted him could be the result of his childhood problems and associations - his mother used to drink alcohol and often abused him. 'Maybe in his childhood other drunk women abused him too, and all this affected his behaviour later in his adult life and led to such horrible consequences.' Among Popkov's other victims were Maria Molotkova, 20, who worked at a water pumping station in Angarsk. She was found dead in the forest after going missing on 17 August 1999. Friends Marina Lyzhina, 35 and Lilia Pashkovskaya, 37, were buried on 8 June 2000 after he picked them up in his police car in the middle of the night as they were returning from a night out.","Mikhail Popkov, 50, stabbed or strangled women over at least eight years .

"A top leader of Yemen's Al Qaeda branch has claimed responsibility for last week's attack on a Paris newspaper when two masked gunmen killed 12 people, including much of the weekly's editorial staff and two police officers. Nasr al-Ansi, a commander of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the branch is known, appeared in an 11-minute internet video, saying that the massacre at Charlie Hebdo was in 'vengeance for the prophet'. The paper had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, which is considered an insult in Islam. Scroll down for video . Twisted: Nasr al-Ansi, a commander of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, claimed that the Kouachi brothers, who massacred 12 people last week, were 'heroes of Islam' Al-Ansi said France belongs to the 'party of Satan' and warned of more 'tragedies and terror'. He said Yemen's Al Qaeda branch 'chose the target, laid out the plan and financed the operation'. He described the gunmen who carried out the massacre as 'heroes of Islam' in the 11-minute rant. The news follows a survivors' edition of the Charlie Hebdo magazine selling out within hours of going on sale in France, with the print run increased to five million copies. Twitter user Eric Randolph wrote: 'My local had a queue of 70 people waiting at 5.45am.' 'The queues have stretched everywhere, but lots and lots of people are disappointed,' said Michel Blanchet, who runs a kiosk near the Gare de l'Est station. A handful of magazines are expected to be available in the UK by the end of the week, but British eBay users are bidding three-figure sums. The latest cover shows a weeping Mohammed, holding a sign reading 'I am Charlie' with the words 'All is forgiven' above him. It is appearing on newsstands one week to the day after the assault in Paris by brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed eight members of the Charlie Hebdo staff, including its editor and three other cartoonists, along with two police officers. Said and Cherif Kouachi, who murdered 12 people last week in Paris, were backed by Al Qaeda in Yemen . One of the Kouachi brothers gestures after slaughtering several members of the Charlie Hebdo editorial team . They yelled in the street afterwards that they were wreaking vengeance for the magazine's blasphemous cartoons and jokes about figures sacred to Islam. One killer shouted 'Charlie Hebdo is dead!' following the massacre. Dr Andreas Krieg, from the Department of Defence Studies at King's College London, said that the group uses attacks like this to justify its existence. He told MailOnline: 'If the franchise and brand of Al Qaeda wants to survive it needs some shocking terror attacks to its name. Unlike ISIS Al Qaeda believes in a global jihad, namely bringing the jihad to the streets of Europe and the U.S. 'They maintain a capable fighting force. Its fighters are battle hardened with an elite whose roots go back to the mujahedeen in Afghanistan during the 1980s. They also have bomb specialists among them who have repeatedly tried to plant explosive devices on planes or other public places. From all of Al Qaeda s outfits this is one of the most active, best financially endowed, most experienced and most grounded.' US intelligence officials, however, said they have no evidence AQAP coordinated the attack or knew about it in advance. The officials spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss classified matters publicly. The latest issue of Charlie Hebdo maintained the intentionally offensive tone that made the newspaper famous in France. The first two pages include drawings by the slain cartoonists: One shows a well-known late French nun talking about oral sex; another shows Muslim, Christian and Jewish leaders dividing up the world. Clamour: The latest issue of Charlie Hebdo, produced one week after many of its editorial staff were murdered, reportedly sold out across France within minutes . The lead editorial lays out a vigorous defense of secularism, and of the newspaper's right to lampoon religions and hold their leaders accountable - and ends with a critique of the Pope. 'For the past week, Charlie, an atheist newspaper, has achieved more miracles than all the saints and prophets combined. 'The one we are most proud of is that you have in your hands the newspaper that we always made,' it reads. It also includes a drawing of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, with a message wishing him good health, penned by murdered cartoonist Georges Wolinski. This picture was the last tweet by the magazine before the attack. Elsewhere readers will find doodles by the magazine's editor, Charb, and a cartoon showing two terrorists ascending to heaven. One, puzzled, asks where all the virgins are that they were promised. In the background the slain staff members are seen on a cloud having sex with multiple women.","Al Qaeda chief Nasr al-Ansi described Paris gunmen as 'heroes of Islam'

"A vast camp for migrants in Calais will open this morning, sparking fears it will attract hundreds more to the French town. It will offer beds, showers, food and even power points to charge phones for the 2,500 migrants trying to reach Britain from the port. The Jules Ferry camp was built on a former children’s summer camp using a £3million EU grant which would include cash that ultimately comes from British taxpayers. 'New Sangatte': The Jules Ferry camp, built on the site of a former children's summer camp, will offer beds, showers, food and power points to charge phones for the 2,500 migrants trying to reach Britain from Calais . It sits right next to the Calais port, where hundreds of illegals try to board lorries each day in the hope of remaining undetected until reaching Britain. Critics of the centre have compared it to the notorious Sangatte camp which became a magnet for thousands of migrants before it was closed down in 2002. Michael Ellis, a Tory MP who sits on the Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘It is bonkers for the Calais authorities to do anything which encourages migrants to come to their city, it’ll only create problems for us next.’ Philip Davies, another Conservative MP, said: ‘This will do nothing to stem the tide of illegal immigrants coming into the UK. ‘It will clearly lead to even more risking their lives to get here and it is therefore outrageous that this is being partly funded by British taxpayers. Meanwhile a third Tory, Philip Hollobone, described the plans as ‘madness’ and condemned the French authorities for providing the migrants ‘with a comfortable base from which to launch their clandestine attempts to break into Britain’. Repurposed: The camp was built on the site of a former children’s summer camp using a £3million EU grant which would include cash that ultimately comes from British taxpayers . Well appointed: The camp includes three football pitches and a tennis court over its 12-acre site . The new permanent day centre is spread over about 12 acres of parkland and comes with three football pitches and a tennis court. Perhaps the only item the holiday camp will lack is a swimming pool. From today, French-based charity La Vie Active will serve food to up to 500 migrants. They will be capable of serving food to 1,500 migrants by mid-March and will also be able to sleep 500 women and children by then. At the moment a second centre – Clement Ader – is currently providing refuge to 500 migrants on cold nights. The migrants, many of whom have smartphones, will be able to charge their mobiles at power points, helping them to surf the internet on their devices. The centre will have hot showers, toilet facilities and a nurse to treat injuries they sustain from attempting to jump on lorries. It is also believed that there will be an office in the complex which will be manned by officers from the UK Border Force. They will be there to inform the migrants of the realities of entering Britain, in an apparent effort to dissuade them. The estimated 2,500 migrants in Calais are mainly from Eritrea, Sudan and Libya in Africa and the war-torn states of Syria and Afghanistan. Desperate to get to Britain: Migrants run behind a truck bound for Dover from Calais to try to board it . The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, announced the plans to build the migrant centre in Calais in October, saying it will cost around £4.3million to run each year. Last month Philippe Mignonet, deputy mayor of Calais, claimed that the lure of the British benefits system is the reason for migrants flocking to Calais and not the new centre. But Alp Mehmet, the vice-chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: ‘The sort of facility proposed by the French will undoubtedly lead to further illegal immigration. ‘The French authorities should be removing illegal migrants, not encouraging them and then asking the British tax payer to help foot the bill.’ Denis Robin, prefect of the Pas de Calais, insisted that the centre was an ‘important provision’ which would be run with ‘utmost professionalism’. He said: ‘There was massive influx of migrants in the summer months from Africa, particularly Eritrea. ‘We were caught off guard and the sheer numbers led us to take emergency measures. ‘At present the situation has stabilised in terms of numbers, but come the warmer weather the numbers are again likely to increase.’","Jules Ferry camp offers beds, showers, food and power outlets for phones .

"A brilliant innovation is reminding the world that no one should underestimate the smug satisfaction that comes with irritating your enemies. When seeking vengeance, this new Sydney company who promise that immature pranks are the best solution. An envelope full of millions of tiny, plastic pieces of glitter is all that is needed to tip someone right over the edge, with the sparkly misery promised to last weeks. The genius behind the website ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com is 22-year-old Sydneysider Matthew Carpenter, who admits 'he hates glitter.' 'I'm a 22 year old dude that has too much free time apparently because now my plans for the next few weeks will consist of sending stupid glitter to terrible people,' Carpenter told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . The next big thing: ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com promises to send an envelope full of glitter to your enemies . An illustration on the website demonstrates the extreme frustration your enemy will experience when they receive an envelope packed with glitter . Although many people may think glitter is 'fun', they are wrong as it can be used as a harmless but intensely irritating torture . 'People call it the herpes of the craft world,' the website said. 'Pay us money, provide an address anywhere in the world and we'll send them so much glitter in an envelope that they'll be finding it everywhere for weeks.' The website was launched on Tuesday night and has already gone viral worldwide. 'The website is just over 24 hours old. We've had over 1.3m visits, 250k social shares so the response has been pretty intense,' said Carpenter. Part  of the appeal is that each package will be individually 'wrapped with hate' by Carpenter himself for the incredibly low price of $9.99 per envelope. The hateful envelopes may seem harmless, with some people on Social Media expressing confusion at the concept due to their personal love of glitter. However, the frustration felt when covered with seemingly endless pieces of glitter cannot be fully understood unless one has experienced the twinkly torture. It sticks to clothes, skin, hair and furniture and somehow has the creepy ability to pop up when least expected for weeks after the glitter ambush. Rave reviews, as well as complaints from unhappy envelope recipients, indicate the product's effectiveness . The glitter will stick to every possible surface of the recipient's body and home and will continually and inexplicably appear for weeks after the ambush . So why should someone use this website to send the sparkly packages? The website founders explain that packaging the envelopes is an extremely messy process. People who use the service can now cause the maximum amount of irritation to their enemy without any personal pain. 'We're making a heroic sacrifice. (Glitter) gets all over our working space,' the ShipYourEnemiesGlitter team explain. 'You can do it yourself if you want. But then you have to handle the glitter, making your own house full of glitter.' These envelopes from hell, known in some circles as 'glitter bombs', are the perfect form of anonymous vengeance which the website promises to do for the bargain price of $9.99. The website even generously gives the option of including a hateful note in the envelope to really hammer the message home. The unique commercial endeavour has paid off as just hours after launching the website was forced to suspend purchases. 'You guys have a sick obsession with shipping people glitter,' Carpenter explained. Although some believe the website is just a gag, the administrators promise the company is real, explaining 'we spent too much time, money and resources putting this... website up to not get paid for it.' The way it works is simple. When on the website, 'click the buy button. Decide whose day you want to ruin and then enter their address.' The website has a helpful FAQ section, although they point out 'Yes, somehow we do have Frequently Asked Questions' The website already has glowing reviews from thrilled customers, including gleeful Grady Chambers: . 'I bought this for my husband, he opened the mail before work & got it everywhere! He had to change, was late for work and might be getting fired, LOL!' However, Alma Henry warned people to not underestimate the power of glitter. 'For my one year anniversary I didn't know what to get my wife, so I bought this thinking it would be funny. 'It wasn't, I'm now divorced, broke and living with my best friend. I'd like to talk with the owner to get a refund and discuss damages.' A thrilled customer wrote a reference, explaining ''I bought this for my husband, he opened the mail before work & got it everywhere!

"Genoveva Anonma is a woman who should be heralded for her footballing achievements, but instead the 27-year-old has had to face incredulous adversity for her successes in the beautiful game. In 2008, she led her native Equatorial Guinea to their first-ever African Women's Championship. Scoring the winning goal of the tournament's showpiece, in a 2-1 triumph against South Africa, Anonma's moment in the spotlight was immediately turned into darkness as questions arose about her gender. Genoveva Anonma says she was once forced to strip naked to prove she was a woman by CAF . 'They asked me to take all my clothes off in front of officials from CAF and the Equatorial Guinea team,' the 2012 African Footballer of the Year said in an interview with BBC Sport. 'I was really upset, my morale was low and I was crying. It was totally humiliating, but over time I have got over it.' Anonma's stark words were the result of the Confederation of African Football's (CAF) decision to choose one of the most derogatory methods to determine her gender. That instance isn't the first time the talented footballer has had to face adversity from her peers. At the 2011 Women's World Cup, Anonma was embroiled in a scandal about her gender alongside her international team-mates, sisters Salimata and Bilguisa Simpore. Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana accused the Guinea trio as men due to their physical attributes. Anonma (left) says the incident came in the 2008 African Women's Championship for Equatorial Guinea . 'You only need to have physical contact with them on the pitch to know this [that they are men],' said Ghana defender Diana Amkomah at the time. Once more the 27-year-old slammed those allegations even offering to undergo medical gender testing in the expectation of silencing her doubters once and for all. Anonma, who plays for German giants Turbine Potsdam, has never the chance to prove she has always been a female. 'I was hoping they would call me to tell me they were taking me to hospital to do tests, but they never did,' she added. 'They did nothing to me. It was just down to me alone to defend myself, to state that I am not a man, I am a woman.'

"The 'lenient' suspended sentence handed to a teacher convicted of having sex with a 16-year-old pupil at school and at home cannot be reviewed because of a legal loophole, it was revealed today. Dozens complained when Stuart Kerner walked free yesterday  but because his sex offence is not within the Attorney General's unduly lenient sentence review scheme it cannot be changed. The religious education teacher was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust after taking the girl's virginity  in a school store cupboard and later taking her home for sex  while his wife was out. Kerner was spared jail for the offence but it emerged today that he has launched an appeal to overturn the conviction and clear his name. But the judge who gave him an 18-month suspended sentence, Mrs Justice Joanna Greenberg, will be investigated after complaints over her comments in court when she said his victim 'groomed' him. Spared jail: Teacher Stuart Kerner, pictured during the trial with his wife Katharine, had sex with a student and took her virginity but was given a suspended sentence after a judge said the girl 'groomed' him . If the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office believe there is a case to answer the judge, whose own website warns 'cross me at your peril,' could be censured, suspended or even sacked. Yesterday the Attorney General's Office (AGO) said that it would consider whether to refer Kerner's sentence to the Court of Appeal after receiving a number of complaints. But today in an embarrassing climbdown an AGO spokesman said: 'After a number of complaints, we carefully considered whether Stuart Kerner's sentence could be referred to the Court of Appeal for being too low - as part of the 'unduly lenient sentence scheme'. 'Mr Kerner's crimes are not included in this scheme, meaning the law officers are unable to refer this. 'However, it's important that the public can challenge what they believe to be exceptionally low sentences. We have been looking at whether the scope of the current scheme is right.' Probe: Judge Joanna Greenberg will be investigated by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office after she said Kerner was 'groomed' by the schoolgirl he abused . The 44-year-old was given only an 18-month suspended sentence after the judge indicated her sympathy for him. However, his instructing solictor Gary Rubin today revealed that Kerner has launched an appeal to try and get the conviction overturned. Mr Rubin said: 'What I can tell you at this stage, is that not only is he planning to appeal, we actually lodged the appeal with the Court of Appeal well before Christmas. 'It was the advice given to his legal advisors that he should lodge an appeal against conviction.' 'I lodged it within 14 days of his conviction.' Last night the officer of the Attorney General has now confirmed it is considering if the sentence handed down was too lenient - but in an embarrassing climbdown has now said it cannot review it. This means that despite 22 complaints from the public Kerner's sentence cannot be changed. The Attorney General's Office (AGO) tweeted last night: 'AGO have received complaints about Stuart Kerner sentence and will consider whether to refer to Court of Appeal under ULS (unduly lenient sentences) scheme. 'Stuart Kerner's sentence will be considered. Decision due by February 11.' Judge Joanna Greenberg QC's suspended sentence and comments during the hearing have sparked controversy and complaints. She told Kerner: 'There is no evidence that you groomed her. It was she who groomed you and you gave into temptation when you were vulnerable.' John Carr, a leading Government adviser on online child safety, described the judge's actions as bizarre. 'I haven't seen all the evidence the judge did but I doubt I will be alone in finding her remarks utterly baffling,' he said. 'How can a 44-year-old man be seduced by a minor who is in his care?' Holly Dustin, of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: 'Judge Greenberg's reported comments in sentencing Stuart Kerner are astonishing in that they literally blame the young victim for his actions. 'This case shows how such deeply held prejudicial attitudes permeate the criminal justice system at all levels and raises serious questions about the adequacy of judicial training on sexual violence.' A spokesman for the Attorney General's office said: 'The office will now ask prosecutors to send us more information on this case, so that one of the law officers can decide whether the sentence should be referred to the Court of Appeal for review.' Evidence Jurors were told how Kerner, pictured, took the pupil's virginity in the same week his wife Katharine  suffered a miscarriage but Judge Joanna Greenberg said he was 'emotionally vulnerable' During his trial at Inner London Crown Court last month, Kerner claimed the girl had invented their relationship, taking the novel Fifty Shades of Grey as a model. But the former vice-principal of Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust. Jurors were told Kerner, who taught RE and ethics, took to carrying around a condom for use if the girl became 'too irresistible'. On the day in February 2012 that they first had sex they met in the store cupboard and barricaded it shut with a chair. That October, Kerner arranged for the girl to come to his house and they had sex before he dropped her home. He was arrested three months later. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had told a teacher about their affair after her parents found sexually explicit material on her phone. Interviewed by police, the girl, who is now 19, said: 'It felt special. But, I dunno, it wasn't really. And admitting that does kind of hurt.' Judge Greenberg described the victim as intelligent and manipulative and said the jury had not judged her a reliable witness. She said the girl had persuaded the school to give her free meals by falsely claiming her mother would not give her lunch money. The teenager also claimed to have been in a car crash and wore bandages for weeks before teachers discovered she was lying. When confronted, she allegedly said: 'That's what I do – I lie.' The judge said Kerner had been in a position of 'emotional instability' when they first had sex because his wife had just had a miscarriage. She added: 'The victim pursued you and had formed an attachment for you which was not something you had encouraged. Her friends described her, accurately in my view, as stalking you. There is no doubt that she was obsessed with you. An obsession that she had harboured for a long time. 'I saw no sign that you had encouraged [the victim] in any way. Were it not for her obsession with you, the offence would never have occurred.It's a tragedy that somebody like you committed offences of this nature and now fall to be sentenced.' But she added: 'You are the responsible adult and it is up to you to show restraint.' Affair: Kerner, outside court yesterday, had sex with the 16-year-old girl at his school in south-east London on a yoga mat and also at his family home when his wife was at work . Joanna Greenberg's profile for Charter Chambers describes her as 'formidable' 'Cross me at your peril,' warns the website of the judge who sentenced Stuart Kerner. Joanna Greenberg's profile for Charter Chambers also says: 'She is a formidable advocate who brooks no interference from a judge or anyone else in her direct approach on behalf of her clients.' The unmarried 64-year-old has been a barrister for more than 40 years. She was called to the Bar in 1972, became a QC in 1994 and was made a circuit judge last July. She has forged something of a television career, appearing as prosecuting counsel in a murder case in a three-part BBC Television series, Trial By Jury, in 1996. More recently she featured in a rape trial in a four-parter, The Verdict, again for the BBC. But her real work is in the courtroom where she says she is 'often instructed in the more difficult and complex murder and sex cases which involve competing experts and their untested opinion'. On the website she lists her interests as skiing, scuba diving and travelling. She studied at King's College, London, after attending Brondesbury and Kilburn High School in the capital. Former pupils include the model Twiggy and Julie Covington, who sang the original version of Don't Cry for me Argentina. Protesting his innocence, Kerner had said the girl was a pathological liar and fantasist who had followed him around 'like a bad smell'. He claimed she had been able to describe his house accurately because she had seen pictures of it on his Apple iPad. And he said she knew what underwear he wore because he had once changed for a panto and left his clothes on view. Edward Ellis, mitigating, said Kerner's relationship with his 'devoted' wife Katharine had become stronger. He said the teacher collapsed following his conviction by a majority of jurors and had considered suicide. Kerner, from Aylesford in Kent, was cleared of other counts of sexual activity. He has been banned for life from working with children and will have to sign the sex offender register indefinitely. His teaching contract was terminated in October. Another campaigner, Jan Macleod of the Women's Support Project, described his suspended sentence as shocking. 'What it says to me is that there's a real lack of understanding about the nature of grooming,' she added. 'Grooming is all about power dynamics. 'In any case, the teacher definitely has a responsibility to say 'No', no matter how eager the child is. The criminal justice system needs to look more at the impact of this kind of thing – it involves a huge breach of trust.'

"These pictures of Chinese students standing in huge lines despite the minus two degrees centigrade temperature is the reason there are growing calls for action to sort out the chronic shortage of library places. These pictures were taken recently ahead of final exams at Nanjing University of Finance and Economics in Nanjing, the capital of eastern China's Jiangsu Province. The queues had already started forming hours before the library officially opened at 8am, regardless of the frost on the ground. Long wait: Chinese students standing in huge lines despite minus two degrees centigrade to enter the library at Nanjing University of Finance and Economics . J'queues: Chinese students have complained that universities aren't doing enough to provide them with an adequate number of study spaces . Officials said they had even opened half an hour earlier to try and meet the demand, but there had still been huge queues, with some waiting over an hour to get in. It is the reason why students want the government to put up more cash for library places. They complained that the universities themselves have been doing little to solve the problem and instead have been cashing in on the desperation of students to get the opportunity to study in the library shortly before exams, by reserving desks and charging students for the access. Student Union spokesman An Chang said: 'Students want to work hard but standing for hours to get a study place is a waste of everyone's time.' Chinese children are taught from an early age to work hard and study if they are to be a success. But students say that making them wait for hours in the cold does not achieve anything and are urging more money for study facilities. They singled out the privatisation of library places recently at the Jilin Agricultural University Library in the city of Changchun as an example of bad practice. Capitalist venture: One university has started renting out private cubicles to students willing to pay their way to peace and quiet . Student Union spokesman An Chang said 'students want to work hard but standing for hours to get a study place is a waste of everyone's time' Officials at the university said they had even opened half an hour earlier to try and meet the demand, but there had still been huge queues . In another step away from its Communist past, the university had converted several floors of its library to make private study rooms for the wealthy few. Students that sign up to pay a yearly fee get their own cubicle allowing them to bypass the rest of their student colleagues standing in queues outside for a place at a table. The university even admitted it was a way of getting money, but those who failed to get a place in a cubicle have complained that there are now even less spaces available for the rest of them. One, Hu Feng, said: 'A library belongs to all students, the booths are a good service but only for a small number of students, and for the majority of us who can't have such a booth, our public study space is reduced by the booths.' One student who failed to get a booth said: 'Everyday I have to get up early and line up to grab a seat, and sometimes I still can't successfully get a seat, but those 169 students are treated as VIPs in the library. A university should not be a two tier society. And a university library should not be run like a profit-making organisation with students treated unequally based on money.' The university revealed that there were 169 one-square-metre rooms that had all sold out in the first day, mostly by senior students preparing for postgraduate and civil service exams. Spokesman Lu Hin said: 'A good study atmosphere is important for students who are preparing for important exams. To save students the troubles of getting up early to grab a seat in the library and provide them a better place to study, the cubicles were set up.' But as well as complaints from those who lost out, students who managed to get booths also complained that they could only be used by the student who took out the lease, and that the booths can not be sub-let or shared with friends.","Pictures have emerged of incredible queues forming outside the library of Nanjing University in China .

Police prosecutors claimed 'the defendant's record extends over the last 18 months from August 29 last year and since there have been continuous offences. (She) continues to make choices with further undesirable people'. Magistrate Mabbutt said: 'The range of the offences are grave matters, the accused has a length history and has outstanding matters, the offences overall have to be considered serious. 'The accused has a history of violence,' he stated, adding that they would most likely like to 'full-time custody'. Detectives working on the Constitution Hill case have received vital information as to the whereabouts of Christopher Chandler who was allegedly behind the wheel of a stolen Audi which eluded police last week . Meantime, it's believed senior detectives have received information about Chandler's recent movements, a police source revealing that they are confident of an imminent arrest. The manhunt has not only focused on premises he's known to have visited across Sydney's west but also beyond, amid fears he may have fled interstate. He has been on the run since leading five police vehicles on a wild chase through the streets of Constitution Hill.

Forensic analysis is yet to determine whether it was the stolen vehicle or a police car which struck the toddler. Chandler is accused of crashing the car through two fences at the end of Bessbrook Way, and through a backyard, as he tried to elude authorities before speeding through a park where up to 15 children, including several of Tatalena's eight siblings were playing cricket with friends, just moments earlier.

"This is the moment a gang of shameless fraudsters were pictured celebrating after pulling off a huge scam worth up to £2 million which saw them using fake credit cards to buy and sell goods including cars, fridges and even dog food. The organised crime group posed for the picture  after they used a counterfeit card machine to create fake credit cards so they could embark on an online spending spree. Yesterday at Manchester Crown Court the six men, all from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and were jailed for a total of more than 16 years. Gang members from left to right: Hamza Mughal, Irfan Khan, Sohail Pasha and Shazad Arshad celebrate after pulling off a huge credit card scam to defraud 57 companies across the UK of up to £2 million . Police found the photo on a mobile phone while investigating 2,000 frauds against businesses across Britain, which were duped into sending the gang a range of good including cabling, tiles, food, alcohol, fridges, cars, high-value metal and other wholesale goods over 18 months. The gang used stolen credit card details from black market internet forums before adopting the identities of the account holders so they could pay for the goods over the phone. The court heard the goods were delivered to a variety of locations across the gang's home turf of Rochdale. Unsuspecting private couriers were met by the gang, the goods were unloaded and shortly afterwards collected by pre-arranged buyers. Hamza Mughal (pictured left) Shazad Arshad, 20, got 18 months in prison while Mughal, 26, got two years . Ahmad Sohail Pasha (left) got three years and four months, Faraz Malik, 28, (right) was sentenced to two . Ammar Khalid (pictured left) and Irfan Khan - Khalid, 27, was jailed for four years whilst Khan, 26, was sentenced to three years and four months imprisonment . Several weeks later, the companies discovered they had been defrauded and the account holders, whose details had been stolen, reported the unusual transactions to their banks. As a result the funds were taken from the businesses' accounts leaving them at a loss. Police began investigating in November 2011 after a tip off about the gang unloading a quantity of stolen steel. Detectives caught two of the gang in the act and as the investigation progressed officers also seized quantities of dog food, fridges and alcohol which had all been bought using compromised details. Officers also recovered phone records and text messages between the gang which showed an exchange of card details, aliases and potential targets. At one house officers found an embossing handle used to print card numbers onto counterfeit cards and fake credit cards were found at three other properties. Hamza Mughal pictured unloading stolen catering goods - he has now been jailed for two years . The counterfeit card maker used by the gang which was seized by Fraud Investigation police . Some of the boxes of dog food bought by the gang with fake credit cards and stolen bank details . Software to write card details onto the magnetic strips of credit cards was found on a laptop in one gang member's bedroom. Initial inquiries by Greater Manchester Police's Fraud Investigation Team identified the gang fraudulently ordered more than £600,000 worth of goods from 57 companies across the UK between June 2011 and November 2012. But officers believe this is just the tip of the iceberg as analysis of phone records suggests they contacted more than 2,000 potential victims and couriers and that the actual loss could be in excess of £2 million pounds. Ringleaders Ammar Khalid, 27, was jailed for four years whilst Irfan Khan, 26, and Ahmed Pasha, 27, were each sentenced to three years four months imprisonment. Shazad Arshad, 20, got 18 months whilst Hamza Mughal, 26, and Faraz Malik, 28, were each locked away for two years. Two other men were convicted of handling stolen goods. Aqeel Malik, 28, from Rochdale, was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment suspended for 12 months, 200 hours unpaid work and a nine month supervision order. The embossing handle found at Arshad's home which was used to print card numbers onto counterfeit cards . Metal bought by the gang using the fake credit cards - they were planning to sell it on for profit . Mohammed Sohail Khan, 26, of Oldham, was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment suspended for 12 months, 200 hours unpaid work and a 9 month supervision order. Two more men will be sentenced at a later date. Det Sgt Phil Larratt, of GMP's Fraud Investigation Team, said: 'This gang were involved in a concerted, full-time operation to defraud companies out of thousands of pounds worth of goods. 'It is clear from the sheer scale of the evidence we recovered that these men thought they had an unearthed a goldmine and had no intention of slowing down or stopping. The gang used stolen credit card details they obtained from the dark web. They then used those details to create fake credit cards using a counterfit xcard machine and an embossing handle. They then used the cards tp buy up to £2 million worth of goods which they later sold on for profit. The gang bought everything from dog food and fridges to alcohol, . When the owners of the stolen credit card details reported the unusual transactions to their banks they were refunded the money - leaving the business owners at a loss. 'I have no doubt they'd still be trying to con businesses out of thousands of pounds today had we not caught them. 'This was this gang's full-time occupation. The group operated as a business with a clear hierarchy and structure. 'Ammar Khalid, Irfan Khan and Ahmed Sohail Pasha directed operations from the comfort of their own homes, accessing the dark web and placing orders using the compromised card details. 'In times of austerity, these businesses lost tens of thousands of pounds thanks to the underhand tactics of this gang and potentially could have faced financial ruin. 'However, thanks to the work and dedication of the officers from the Fraud Investigation Unit we were able to unravel their web of deception and they have now been exposed so that no other businesses can be targeted by this gang. 'We carried out a painstaking investigation involving meticulous examination of financial and phone records and I am delighted all that work has paid off. ' 'Greater Manchester Police are determined to disrupt and prosecute the perpetrators of this type of serious and organised criminality. 'Anyone found guilty of committing these types of fraud, as this gang have found out to their cost, can expect a stint in prison.'","Gang of six were involved in a full-time operation to defraud companies .

"Network Rail bosses were today accused of overseeing a 'farce' which caused chaos for train passengers during the Christmas holidays. MPs mocked the admission that equipment brought in to reduce breakdowns itself broke down while passengers were confronted with blank information boards in a communication shambles. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne was hauled in front of Parliament after thousands of people were left stranded or in overcrowded stations when engineering works over-ran, with East Coast mainline services into King's Cross and cancellations of services into Paddington. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne was challenged by MPs over a lack of contingency planning and poor communication when over-running works caused chaos at Christmas . A damning report last week blamed poor planning, equipment failures and communication breakdowns for the problems at London stations Paddington, King's Cross and Finsbury Park on December 27. Passengers diverted from King's Cross found Finsbury Park so overcrowded it had to be closed, causing further delays. Mr Carne was challenged by MPs over why problems mounted, which meant work which should have been finished by Boxing Day ran into problems. Transport committee chairman Louise Ellman said: 'It does appear that there are elements of farce amongst the chaos. 'The equipment brought in to reduce the risk of breakdowns broke down itself. Safety clearance took five times longer than intended. There was no contingency plan where two stations had closed. 'Passengers were directed to an over-crowded Finsbury Park station.' She added that many information boards were blank, leaving passengers in the dark. 'That's a picture of chaos,' Ms Ellman added. MPs mocked the admission that equipment brought in to reduce breakdowns itself broke down while passengers were confronted with blank information boards in a communication shambles . Mr Carne began by 'unreservedly apologising' to people who were affected. 'Clearly this was an unacceptable situation for them, they had a very, very difficult day.' He blamed a number of 'small incidents' which together caused a major problem. 'There was a sequence of small events that escalated in the way that they did.' The quality of information that was provided to passengers was not adequate, he admitted. Ms Elmman added: 'The cumulative effect was massive disruption which affected thousands of people over a very busy holiday period.' Work starting on Christmas Day at Holloway Junction, north of King's Cross, included replaced two junctions and around 500m of track. By the evening of Christmas Day the project was already six hours behind after new equipment dsigned to prevent breakdowns failed. Failures: Poor planning, equipment failures and communication breakdowns contributed to the Christmas train chaos, including a crush at Finsbury Park (pictured), a Network Rail report found . The Network Rail report said last week: 'The equipment failures were unexpected, due to the provision of new hardware that had been bought specifically to reduce the risk of breakdown. 'However this new hardware had not been tested in the railway environment before deployment, and t not reliable when put to use.' Services which did manage to run on December 27 that ran were massively overcrowded and delayed, while suburban Finsbury Park station failed to cope with the crowds. Some services were ushered into King's Cross by staff waving red and yellow flags. Network Rail admits that there was no choice but to send passengers to the 'entirely unsuitable' station at Finsbury Park. But NR network operations managing director Robin Gisby told MPs: 'It was the right decision to use Finsbury Park (as the terminus) and I would endorse that decision again.' He added: 'said: ""Finsbury Park was entirely unsuitable compared with King's Cross but there was nothing else we could do. ""Any other decision would have caused even more discomfort for passengers."" Meanwhile at London's Paddington station, while the physical work was completed on time, safety validation work that should have taken two hours instead took ten. In the week after the overruns, Mr Carne announced that he would not be taking his annual performance-related bonus for 2014-15. The bonus could have been as much as £135,000. Asked about the bonus at today's hearing, Mr Carne said he was the person responsible overall for the Christmas engineering programme but added that he considered that bonuses were earned for a performance over a whole year. He said: 'I know that the performances of the railway today are not meeting the public's expectations on a number of fronts. We are not delivering.' Mr Carne was in Cornwall for Christmas and said he was informed of the King's Cross overrun at 2pm on Boxing Days and kept in touch by telephone from then on.","Transport select committee mocks bosses over handling of festive chaos .

"When you've got a daunting list of tasks that need to be done, time can seem to flash past in the blink of an eye. And now a study has found that having goals that are in conflict - such as working late to impress the boss and making time for your family - can make time seem to pass even quicker. The researchers say being under pressure can lead to anxiety and make us think we are short on time - but reducing stress could be a solution. In fact, simply breathing deeply and saying 'I'm excited' was found to improve a person's coping skills and slow down a person's perception of time. Study by Duke University in NC found conflicting goals make time go fast. People who had multiple things to do and were stressed (stock image shown) felt more pressed for time . The research was carried out by Professor Jordan Etkin from the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. With her colleagues she looked at what makes us feel pressed for time, and how that affects our behaviour. Managing things on your to-do list, and thus your work-life balance, can often make time seem to pass extremely quickly. The conclusion was that having goals in conflict, such as perceiving exercise to get in the way of family time, made people anxious, leading them to think they were short on time. A study has claimed that the fragrance of lavender can have a positive effect on how trustworthy a person seems. The researchers say that the scent of the plant promotes relaxation, which can help create mutual trust between two people. And they say their findings could have important implications in areas such as team sports and negotiations. The study was carried out by Dr Roberta Sellaro and Dr Lorenza Colzato from Leiden University in the Netherlands and published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology. Dr Colzato told MailOnline said that the effect was likely due to the calming effect of lavender. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that, from an anatomical point of view, the olfactory nerve is connected to the medial prefrontal cortex a brain region that '“controls” the way we trust others,' she said. As a solution to the problem, Professor Etkin and her colleagues said breathing exercises could restore people's sense of time. In the experiment half of participants that had said they had conflicting goals were told to take 11 seconds over a breath, while the other half who did not were told simply to count to 11. The slow breathers reported less anxiety and a longer view of time than the counting group. Similarly, conflicted subjects told to repeat aloud 'I am excited!' also reported that they felt like they had more time available. 'Goal conflict is often about perception,' Professor Etkin said. 'In many situations, we don't have to feel that conflict. The simple tactics identified in my research can help manage that experience.' In their experiments, Professor Etkin and her colleagues studied people who saw their goals as competing, and those who saw little conflict. In the first experiment, subjects were asked to list two goals that were 'in conflict with one another,' while a control group listed two goals with no mention of conflict. Then the researchers recorded their perceptions of available time. Participants who considered conflicting goals felt they had less time. This held true regardless of whether the conflict involved money or time. In the study the researchers found conflicting goals affected the behaviour of people. For example they were more likely to be impatient or spend money, such as paying for quick delivery (stock image shown) Another experiment asked participants to choose between two cars, drawing on prior research that identified safety and pollution as two big consumer concerns. Participants who were told that the car with the worst survival rate was the most eco-friendly - putting two valued goals in conflict - reported feeling more stress and having less time than those offered a car that was clearly superior in both categories. The researchers also found the stress of competing goals made consumers less willing to wait and more inclined to pay to save time. In a twist on the car experiment, participants were told their chosen car was not ready and were asked how long they'd be prepared to wait. Those in the high-conflict group were willing to wait fewer days than those with less conflict. In another scenario, subjects with goal conflicts were willing to pay 30 per cent more for expedited shipping of a DVD.","Study by Duke University in NC found conflicting goals make time go fast .

"A Pennsylvania teacher has been charged with having an affair with a male student for almost a year, allegedly exchanging an alleged 509 phone calls with the 16-year-old and 319 text messages. Sarah O'Neill, 35, a former English teacher at all-boys private boarding school Church Farm School in Exton, was caught by a fellow staff member after leaving a love letter she wrote to the boy on the office printer. 'The thought that I could love so deeply and so wrongly pervaded before you and I even officially began,' O'Neill allegedly wrote the teen, according to NBC Philadelphia. 'It was quite a long winter break before my lips even attempted yours and I wondered if you were as affected as I.' Scroll down for video . Inappropriate: Sarah O'Neill, the former chair of the English department  at Church Farm School in Exton, Pennsylvania, has been charged with four counts of corruption of minors . Police say the pair had confessed their love to each other and were together 10 months. The relationship lasted even after O'Neill was asked to resign following the discovery of the letter. The teen, who is now 17, told police he began seeing O'Neill in January 2014. He said they first kissed at Motel 6 in King of Prussia in the February, and then again in March on O'Neill's birthday. The boy claims the pair also enacted in oral sex on several occasions at the hotel, in O'Neill's car and at a park. A custodian told police she caught O'Neill and the boy in a locked classroom with the lights off three times. Scene: Police say the pair had a 10-month relationship both on and off the Church Farm School campus . One time her stocking appeared ripped and another O'Neill said she was helping the boy with extra credit, the custodian said. On top of the hundreds of calls and texts, police say the two talked on the phone for a total of 106 hours and also exchanged emails. In one the teen asked O'Neill what she was wearing. She replied: 'I should be wearing sexy clothing for you when you ask that. Like some tight underwear or nothing. But I am too formal for such outlandishness.' The teen then went missing from campus in November, and it became clear he was O'Neill. Caught: The school filed a report with police after catching O'Neill with the student . Charged: Police say the affair in started in January 2014 and that O'Neill was asked to resign in September, but the pair were still seeing each other in November . He told police they were at the Extended Stay America in Exton having oral sex. He returned to the campus after several phone calls from the $35,000 a year boarding school. Church Farm School told NBC Philadelphia that O'Neill was employed from September 2007 to June 2014. She was arrested following an investigation. O'Neill has been charged with four counts of corruption of minors. She is currently out on bond and scheduled for a preliminary hearing on February 2.","Sarah O'Neill, 35, was an English teacher at Church Farm School, an all-boys boarding school in Exton, Pennsylvania, for seven years .

"Michigan State Police are investigating after a video emerged showing cops brutally beating a handcuffed suspect in the street - before two officers gave each other a celebratory fist bump. The video, captured by a resident from inside her Grosse Pointe home on Monday, shows one male officer apparently punching Andrew Jackson Jr., 51, before another kicks him in the side. At one point, Jackson, a suspect in an earlier carjacking, calls out for Jesus. 'What did you say?' asks one of the officers, who then kneels on the man back. 'Jesus? You're calling Jesus? Don't you dare. Don't you f***ing dare!' Scroll down for video . Violent: A police officer climbs on a carjacking suspect and punches him while another officer delivers blow to his side. The footage, pictured above, was captured by a woman in a nearby house . Job well done: Another officer, left, then arrives on the scene and fist bumps her fellow officer over the man . After the initial burst of violence, the man stays quiet on the ground and a female officer approaches and fist bumps one of the male officers. 'They're tapping each other, talking about a good job,' says the woman behind the camera, Emma Craig. She later shared the footage to her Facebook page. After the incident, Grosse Pointe Park police issued a statement saying that Jackson had allegedly pointed a gun at a mother and her two children, forcing them out of their car and stealing it. Police tracked the vehicle and took chase, before the suspect got out of the car and fled about a quarter of a mile on foot. Officers then caught up with him and tried to Tase him but it failed to work so they had to use force to take him into custody and remove his weapon, police said in a statement. In custody: The suspect, Andrew Jackson Jr., 51, allegedly stole a car at gunpoint on Monday . Jackson had absconded his parole from April 2014 when he missed a meeting with his parole officer and moved address, police said. Records show he was convicted in 2004 of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, assault with intent to rob while armed and fleeing a police officer, the Detroit News reported. In the footage, the officers can be heard discovering a gun on the man after the arrest. Ron Craig, whose mother shot the footage, told the Detroit News there was no justification for the violence used against Jackson. 'He was in handcuffs,' Craig said. 'You had him captured. He was no threat.' He added: 'It's not a race issue, it's a humanitarian issue.' On Wednesday, demonstrators from the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality gathered outside the Grosse Pointe Police station to call for prosecution of the officers involved. Coalition director Ron Scott said the group believes 'the officers' actions, once the suspect was handcuffed, were not justified'. Grosse Pointe Police Sergeant Jeff Longo briefly addressed the protesters to say that Chief David Hiller had no comment for them and that an investigation is under way. Hiller previously said officers' actions were appropriate considering the sequence of events. Demands: Ron Scott speaks at rally in front of the Grosse Pointe Park city offices on Wednesday as he and other protesters called for the prosecution of the two officers seen beating Jackson in the video . 'We're looking at it, and we believe the officers actions were proper,' he said. 'In effecting the arrest, they had to kick to get his arms free because he was going for his gun, which was in his waistband.' Michigan State Police are investigating the incident after being contacted by Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy, who said she would be 'actively monitoring' the investigation. It is not yet clear which agency the officers were from; the stolen car task force includes officers from Grosse Pointe Park, Detroit, Warren, Harper Woods and Highland Park. Jackson is being held by Grosse Pointe Park police for parole violations and could get up to 60 months additional time, police said.","Footage captured by a resident shows two police officers punching and kicking a man they were arresting near Detroit on Monday .

"The owners of two American Pit Bull Terriers that bit off a six-year-old girl's ear in a vicious attack were fined just £80 each. Ellie May Hall was savaged by the dogs as she played on her scooter in her back garden - just yards from her home in Ashington, Northumberland. One of the animals started biting her head and neck while the other sank its teeth into her torso and legs. The schoolgirl suffered multiple injuries and part of her ear was bitten off. Ellie May Hall, pictured in hospital after attack with her mother Tina, has suffered 'significant psychological effects' after the attack. She was savaged by dogs as she played just yards from her Northumberland home . She was also left with a hole in her arm and bite marks to her thighs, and needed a two-and-a-half hour operation, skin grafts and 11 stitches in her head. Mother and daughter, Elizabeth Mitchell, 43, and Stacey Mielnik, 20, admitted being the owners of dogs which caused injury while dangerously out of control in a public place. The women walked free from Newcastle Crown Court last week after a judge imposed three-month suspended prison sentences, and £80 fines. The dogs were destroyed after the attack. Today Ellie's family have dismissed their punishment, describing the sentence as 'an absolute joke'. Ellie, who turned seven in November, was playing in her back garden around 3pm on May 4, when the two American Pit Bulls approached her. The girl believed the dogs were friendly when they came up to the garden and started sniffing, after smelling the scent of Ellie's dog. The pit bulls then suddenly began to savagely maul the child. Elizabeth Mitchell, 43, and daughter Stacey Mielnik, 20, were given a suspended three month prison sentence at Newcastle Crown Court last week. Ellie's parents have today branded their sentences 'an absolute joke' The attack was only brought to a halt when a neighbour chased away the dogs with a crowbar. Ellie's parents have now spoken of their disgust, claiming the owners should have been banned from keeping dogs, ordered to do community service and to pay compensation. The Halls worry the court's failure to impose a ban could see another child injured. Ellie's mother Tina, 31, who also has a 10-year-old daughter, Chloe, said: 'They should have been made to do community service at least. 'They could go out and buy a dog now. We have got no justice. I cannot understand why we went to crown court and for that.' Schoolgirl Ellie was playing with a friend near her home on Portia Street, Northumberland (pictured) when the dogs approached her. They quickly turned violent and started attacking her . Her father Richie, a 33-year-old builder who was in court with his wife for the sentencing last month, added: 'Our biggest fear is it could happen again. It is a million to one chance; we were really unlucky. 'But it could happen again. That is on the judge's head, and the legal system. It is an absolute joke. 'They have had an £80 fine that everybody gets. They have walked away Scot free. The amount of sleepless nights we have had it is unreal. 'It is not a sentence, it is a waste of time. It is a joke, we are gutted.' Ellie was mauled by two American pit bull terriers that approached her as she played. Above, file image of an American pit bull terrier . Ellie, a pupil at Central Primary School, was playing with a friend at around 3pm on May 4 when the dogs attacked. Jason Charlton, who was working with a crowbar nearby, and two others saved Ellie when they fought off the dogs. The American Pit Bull Terrier is banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 which prohibits the ownership of animals bred for their fighting abilities. Last month, the court heard that Mr Charlton heard a child's screams. 'He thought it was a dog fight then he heard a child screaming and crying,' said Prosecutor Emma Dowling. 'He opened his back gate and could see a small child on her knees facing into the rear gate. 'She had her hands on her head to protect herself and both dogs were attacking her, one towards the neck and head and the other on her torso. 'He had a crowbar in his hand and chased the dogs away but he said the dogs returned.' Mr Charlton said he was worried for his own safety because both dogs appeared extremely vicious. In a statement to the court, he said: 'It was a horrific and terrifying incident. I'm positive if I did not come out when I did the dogs would have continued to attack Ellie. 'It was clear she had sustained substantial injuries.' The court heard both dogs were at the home of Mitchell when Mielnik arrived at the house, coming in through the back gate. Miss Dowling said: 'That gate does have bolts but they are not used by the family routinely. 'On this day they must have been left closed but not bolted or not closed properly because both dogs escaped from the rear yard into the rear lane.' The attack continues to cause Ellie and her parents ongoing problems physically and mentally. Miss Dowling said: 'She has suffered significant psychological effects and struggles to sleep. 'She is now extremely frightened of dogs and her family have had to get rid of their own dog because Ellie was petrified at what might happen. Recorder Anton Lodge QC said he hoped the community would not continue to 'behave unpleasantly' towards the mother and daughter when he sentenced them at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) last week . 'She struggles to visit her grandparents because they have neighbours with dogs either side so phone calls have to be made before they visit to make sure the dogs are in the house. 'Her parents have also been affected significantly and are worried about the effect this has had on Ellie. This has had a lasting effect on the family as a whole.' Mitchell, 43, and Mielnik, 20, consented to the dogs being destroyed after the attack. The Dangerous Dogs Act was introduced in 1991 as a means of keeping vulnerable people and children safe from animals. Prohibited breeds are so because they have been bred for their abilities to fight. Among them  is the pit bull terrier, the Japanese tosa, and any other considered by the Secretary of State to have been bred for fighting. Banned breeds cannot be kept, bred, sold or exchanged under the law.  Anyone who owns a banned breed cannot take it out in public without a muzzle. If a person commits an Dangerous Dogs related offence, they can be disqualified for dog ownership and be ordered to have the animal put down. The court heard the pair have suffered threats in their local community and have had their windows smashed and been forced to move as a result of the incident. Mark Styles, for Mitchell, said: 'She has been a dog owner for 30 years and is devastated and truly horrified at what happened to Ellie, it has turned her life upside down. 'She is a new mother and has been subjected to harassment in the local area and has been forced to move home twice and her windows have been put out.' Richard Bloomfield, for Mielnik, said: 'The dogs had given no prior indication of behaving in this way, it was an attack out of the blue. 'What she did wrong is to fail to take proper precautions to make sure the gate was secure, not realising the gravity of the consequences that afternoon when they got loose. 'She is distraught and deeply remorseful. She lives alone with her daughter and has suffered abuse from the local community.' Recorder Anton Lodge QC sentenced both Mitchell and Mielnik to three month suspended prison sentence. 'The community should realise the punishment for what you have done is reserved to the courts, which are publicly seen and overlooked,' said the recorder. 'I hope the community will not continue to behave in an unpleasant way towards either of you.'","Ellie May Hall, six, was mauled by the two American Pit Bull Terriers .

"She might want to start paying closer attention. An incredible video has shown the moment a distracted female humpback failed to spot a group of whale watchers aboard a small boat off Maui in Hawaii - so barreled right through them. On the footage, which was taken by passenger Jennifer Nap earlier this month, the group gasps when they first spot the female humpback with her calf - unaware that they'll soon be getting a much closer view. Suddenly, she turns towards their boat and, slapping her large pectoral fin, heads their way. Spotted: A group of whale watchers off Maui in Hawaii spotted this mother humpback whale with her calf during a trip - and gasped in joy... but she was about to get much, much closer . On her way: The whale, followed by her calf, suddenly turned towards the boat and headed their way . 'It's gonna ram us,' one passenger shouts, while others scream in shock. 'This is so awesome!' says another as the whale glides beneath their 25-foot inflatable boat. Although the knock from the whale wasn't a hard strike, it was enough to 'toss our boat a good five feet when she hit,' Jennifer Nap told GrindTV. 'As soon as she was done pushing us aside she dove under, then popped right back up on the other side with her calf,' she said. Nap, who shared the video to YouTube, explained she was taking the Ultimate Whale Watch trip with her husband, Ryan, when they spotted the whales from afar. The crew had switched off the engines - and experts said this could be one of the reasons the mom whale didn't notice the boat. Water sight! With no plan of stopping - and likely distracted by her calf and a bothersome male nearby - the whale heads towards the boat as the spectators scream in joy and shock . Collision: The whale can be seen swimming beneath the boat, which is knocked and moved about five feet . Just passing through: After the collision, the whale and the calf continued as if nothing had happened . But she was also likely keeping her eye on a bothersome male whale lurking nearby, said Lee James, CEO for Ultimate Whale Watch. 'It is most likely that this mom was distracted with her calf and keeping another eye on a escort that was being a little irritating for the female, as escorts can be,' James told GrindTV. Afterwards, she carried on slapping her fin 'like nothing happened', he said. It is unlikely that she was trying to warn the passengers to keep away from her calf because a whale is more likely to slap its tail fin - rather than the pectoral fin - and make noises to signal its anger. Each year, humpback whales migrate from cool waters near Alaska to Hawaii, where they breed, and can be seen regularly between November and May, according to the Pacific Whale Foundation.","The whale was likely distracted by her calf and a bothersome male nearby when she turned towards the boat of tourists and swam right through .

"Kurt Busch has a reason not to believe his ex-girlfriend's claim she was assaulted his ex-girlfriend: she is a trained government assassin  who once came home in an evening gown covered in blood. The 36-year-old driver also known as The Outlaw appeared in court Tuesday to respond to his ex Patricia Driscoll's request for a no-contact order, weaving stories of international intrigue. Busch and his legal team painted Driscoll as both a jilted ex and a cold-blooded assassin who once claimed a female CIA operative from the film 'Zero Dark Thirty,' about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, was partly based on her. Scroll down for video . Defense: NASCAR driver Kurt Busch went to court over an ex-girlfriend's request for a no-contact order and described her as a deadly contract killer and government assassin . The NASCAR star said Driscoll spoke about her assassin status repeatedly, claiming to have undertaken missions across Central and South America and Africa. Busch detailed a story from a time when the couple was in El Paso, Texas, where Driscoll left in camouflage gear but later returned in a trench coat covering an evening gown soaked with blood. Earlier in the hearing, Busch had said his ex told him she was a mercenary who killed for money, and showed off pictures of bodies with gunshot wounds. Michael Doncheff, who was once a personal assistant to the couple, also said Driscoll claimed she was a trained killer for the US government, saying she once told him, 'I take down foreign governments. I own Washington.' He also said Driscoll told him in September  she had been body slammed by a big man while helping round up immigrants at the Mexican border, but said he considered the story 'far-fetched.' 'Everybody on the outside can tell me I'm crazy, but I lived on the inside and saw it firsthand,' Busch said when his attorney, Rusty Hardin, questioned why he still believed Driscoll is a hired killer. Intrigue: The NASCAR star said Driscoll claimed to be a trained assassin and said she partly inspired the CIA operative Maya (pictured) from the film Zero Dark Thirty about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden . Split: Busch testified Monday that he decided to end his relationship with Driscoll after a race last fall because she was monopolizing his schedule and he needed to focus on racing . Kiss of death?: Michael Doncheff, who served as personal assistant to the couple, said Driscoll spoke about being a government assassin, and once told him 'I own Washington' Though neither Driscoll nor her attorney refuted Busch's recounting of events during the four-day hearing, Driscoll called the claimed 'ludicrous' during an interview with the Associated Press Tuesday night. She also suggested Busch pulled them from a script she was writing that Busch had proofread. 'These statements made about being a trained assassin, hired killer, are ludicrous and without basis and are an attempt to destroy my credibility,' said Driscoll, works for military contractor Frontline Defense Systems. 'Not even Rusty Hardin believes this.' 'I find it interesting that some of the outlandish claims come straight from a fictional movie script I've been working on for eight years,' Driscoll added. Busch testified Monday that he decided to end his relationship with Driscoll after a race last fall because she was monopolizing his schedule and he needed to focus on racing. Driscoll said Busch assaulted her in his motorhome at Dover International Speedway a week later, grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times. Busch and his attorneys have denied the allegations, which are the subject of a separate criminal investigation. Driscoll's attorney, Carolyn McNeice, cross-examined Busch on Tuesday, but few of her questions dealt directly with the assault allegations. Busch has testified that he repeatedly told Driscoll to leave after she showed up unannounced at his motorhome, finally cupping her cheeks in his hands, looking her in the eye and telling her she had to go. 'He advised that her head tapped the wall as he was doing that,' Detective James Wood testified Tuesday, recounting Busch's interview with Dover police in November. Richard Andrew Sniffen, a Christian music minister who performs at NASCAR outreach events and befriended Busch and Driscoll, said Driscoll told him on the night of the alleged assault only that Busch had pushed her and that she hit her head. Sniffen said Driscoll was upset, angry and brokenhearted, but that she never said she was afraid of Busch and seemed intent on reconciling. That attitude shifted in the weeks that followed, Sniffen said, with Driscoll going 'from a broken heart looking for love and reconciliation to anger and a little bit of revenge.' 'I will destroy him,' Sniffen said Driscoll told him, adding that she repeatedly said she would take Busch down. A court ruling on Driscoll's request for a no-contact order is expected later this month or in early February.","The NASCAR star was in court to respond to Patricia Driscoll's request for no-contact order over alleged assault .

"From the intricate details of a bee's mouth to the striking lines on the legs of a praying mantis, these incredible images reveal the stunning patterns that are hidden in the world around us. Each image was taken using a new generation of microscope, dubbed Cytell, which works like an automated 'point and shoot' camera to instantly capture tiny details. The images were put together by Gary Sarkis, who works for GE Healthcare Life Sciences in New York. Pictured is a close up of lingual papillae which are the small, nipple or hair–like structures on the upper surface of the human tongue . The series began when he took a bee's leg to work after helping his daughter analyse it as part of her school science project. 'My daughter and I observed the leg at home with her toy microscope,' Mr Sarkis said. 'We spent a lot of quality time together moving it around and getting it in focus. 'But when we were done, we had nothing more to take away than the memory of what the bee's leg looked like.' In the lab, Mr Sarkis used Cytell to take a closer look. The device is designed to allow researchers to rapidly analyses samples such as insect limbs and cells. An ant's head is on the left while on the right is a cross-section of bracken - a type of fern common in Ireland. The images were put together by Gary Sarkis, who works for GE Healthcare Life Sciences in New York .

Each app directs the system through differemt tasks and lab tests, allowing routine sample testing to be done in a few steps. 'It allows [scientists] to simply set up very specific kinds of experiments and automatically receive data in the form of graphs, charts and reports to see if they worked,"" Mr Sarkis said. 'It's similar to the point-and-shoot camera,' he added. 'It helps take a lot of the microscopist out of getting the perfect shot. 'It's similar to the point-and-shoot camera,' Mr Sarkis said. 'It helps take a lot of the microscopist out of getting the perfect shot. When Mr Sarkis looked at his daughter's sample in his lab with Cytell, 'an amazingly detailed hairy leg popped right up on my computer screen,' he said. For fun, he also imaged the leg in fluorescent light and saw that it was 'very auto-flourescent,' and generated its own light. After the first leg, Mr Sarkis imaged the rest of his daughter's collection with the machine. After that, he acquired more school samples on Ebay, sold by parents whose children had lost interest. 'To me, these are hidden treasures which have led to some amazing images,' he says. To date, Mr Sarkis has taken over 2,000 pictures with Cytell and assembled a 'best of' list. 'My wife turned a pair into canvas portraits to hang in our house,' he says.

"A metal bolt the size of a human arm has broken off from a London skyscraper dubbed the 'Cheesegrater' - for the third time in the past two months. British Land, the company which built the Leadenhall Building, revealed yesterday that one of 3,000 'mega-bolts' holding the 48-storey structure together had snapped. Two steel bolts of the same type - measuring five inches in diameter - fell off Britain's fourth tallest building in November last year. Hazardous: A third 'mega bolt' has snapped from a London skyscraper dubbed the 'Cheesegrater' (pictured) Danger averted: The building's developer confirmed the structural integrity of the building had not been compromised . The pavement around the building was cordoned off two months ago after one of the bolts fell to the ground, but no passers-by were harmed. In the latest incident, the third bolt snapped off but was caught instantly by a safety device installed on the building last year. Tests conducted by the 224m-high building's developer concluded the bolts have fractured because of a phenomenon known as 'hydrogen embrittlement'. This process occurs when hydrogen inadvertently seeps into the steel during the manufacturing phase, and slowly weakens it. The accident is the latest controversy attached to the ongoing spread of skyscrapers across London, which has prompted some critics to claim that the rapid pace of development could pose safety problems. The Cheesegrater was forced to adopt its unusual shape in a bid to preserve views of St Paul's Cathedral in the skyline, while another skyscraper, dubbed the 'Walkie Talkie', had to undergo renovation work after its windows focussed red-hot rays onto the pavement below. Landmark: The 'Cheesegrater' is located in the City of London and cost an estimated £286million to construct . British Land insisted last night that the problem had been resolved and that other bolts in the building were not at risk of breaking. 'In November 2014, we reported that two bolts had fractured at the building,' the firm said in a statement. 'Investigations undertaken by contractor Laing O’Rourke and structural engineers Arup have now been completed. These confirm that the problem is limited to certain bolts. 'Arup has also confirmed that there is no adverse effect on the structural integrity of the building. A programme to replace a number of bolts will take place as a precautionary measure.' The 'Cheesegrater' is located in the City of London and cost an estimated £286million to construct. It is the fourth tallest building in Britain, and the second tallest in the City. Despite the repeated accidents, the City of London Corporation - the area's local authority - says it does not plan to intervene, and will leave the developer to determine whether or not the skyscraper poses a risk to the public. This latest incident comes at a bad time for British Land, who have recently announced they will be leasing an extra 93,000 square feet of the building's space. Controversy: A clutch of new skyscrapers have been built in London in the past few years . Plans for the Leadenhall building were first proposed in 2001. The steel structure was completed in 2014, and has earned the name the 'Cheesegrater' for its distinctive wedge shape - designed to preserve the view of St. Paul's Cathedral. Owner / Developer: British Land . Address: 122 Leadenhall Street, City of London . Nickname: The Cheesegrater . Construction period: 2001 - 2014 . Estimated cost: £286million . Floors: 48 . Height to tip: 224m . Occupied height: 203m . UK ranking: 4th tallest building in UK . Global ranking: 493rd tallest building in world . The two bolts  which broke off last year were  tested on site and in a laboratory at the time, with tests concluding that the fault was in the bolt's material mechanism and not the structure itself. British Land is replacing 'mega-bolts' on 11 floors of the building as a 'precautionary measure' following last year's probe. It is believed the first bolt broke on the 19th floor but stayed within the building's structure, without hitting the ground - while the second bolt piece plummeted from the fifth floor. Fortunately, it landed in an area already cordoned off for construction. Floor space in the skyscraper, which was finally completed last month, is the most expensive in the City - FM Global, the American insurance company, agreed to pay £85 per sq ft to rent the 41st floor. Aon, the multinational insurer, signed a contract to be the main tenant of the tower in 2011. The Cheesegrater was designed by Lord Rogers of Riverside, who redeveloped Lloyd's of London, but construction had to be halted during the recession when the value of commercial properties fell. The building's sloping shape was calculated to allow a view of St Paul's from certain vantage points around London.","The company who built Leadenhall Building confirm a 'mega bolt' snapped .

"The higher the heels were, the more a woman's gait, including the movement of her knees, changed, Stanford University research found (file photo) Wearing stilettos may not only be painful at the time. It could also raise the odds of arthritis in years to come. A study found that walking in three-inch heels causes changes to gait similar to those seen in ageing and arthritic knees. The finding could help explain why osteoarthritis is twice as common in women as men. The Californian researchers said: ‘Because women and men are observed to have similar knee biomechanics during barefoot walking, gender differences in footwear, specifically high-heeled shoes, have been implicated as a possible factor for the higher incidence of osteoarthritis in women.’ The most common form of arthritis, osteoarthritis, caused by wear and tear of cartilage that helps our joints take the strain of bending, lifting, gripping and kneeling, affects more than eight million Britons. Stiff, swollen and painful joints can make walking difficult, with stairs particularly tricky. The Stanford University researchers studied the gait of 14 women as they walked in different types of shoes, from flat trainers to heels that left the women teetering just over three inches off the ground. The higher the heels were, the more their gait, including the movement of their knees, changed. Writing in the Journal of Orthopaedic Research, the scientists said being overweight may make things even worse. They added: ‘Many of the changes observed with increasing heel height and weight were similar to those seen with ageing and osteoarthritis progression. ‘This suggests that high heel use, especially in combination with additional weight, may contribute to increased osteoarthritis risk in women.’ Other recent research has shown that when a woman slips on a pair of heels, it takes, on average, just over an hour for her feet to start to hurt. The survey, for the College of Podiatry, found that women are three times as likely as men to cram their feet into uncomfortable shoes – and that as a result, nine out of ten have suffered problems from bunions and corns to sprains and strains. Experts warn that the prolonged wearing of high heels can also trigger stress fractures and trapped nerves. On the plus side, studies show that men are more likely to help a woman wearing heels than one in flats. The survey, for the College of Podiatry, found that women are three times as likely as men to cram their feet into uncomfortable shoes – and that as a result, nine out of ten have suffered problems from bunions and corns to sprains and strains . It's natural to want to show your best side on a first date. But it takes women one year and seven months to show their partner their true selves, a study shows. Most of the 1,000 women polled said that the longer they remain in a relationship, the less obsessed they are with appearing flawless at all times. But some 40 per cent admitted they deliberately hide the details of their beauty regime from their partners, and a third said they always want to keep up the pretence that they are naturally glamorous. One in 20 even admitted they have never allowed their man see them without a full face of make-up on. The research by make-up and beauty company QVS revealed that men are oblivious to the lengths their loves go to. A quarter of the 1,000 men polled said they have no idea what their partner’s beauty regime entails.","Stanford University research could help explain why osteoarthritis is twice as common in women as men .

"A family holiday to celebrate a honeymoon and a 40th birthday was ruined after a father-of-three was hospitalised with severe gastric illness. The Swannell family, from West Yorkshire, had booked a week's stay at the First Choice Holiday Village resort in Sarigerme, Turkey, when Mark Swannell, 46, fell seriously ill a few days into the break with diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea and lethargy. Mr Swannell, a bus driver from Dewsbury, said: 'I was in a really bad way and Nicola had no option but to get the hotel doctor to come to our room as I felt like I was going to collapse. Mark Swannell was hospitalised with severe gastric illness after a stay at the Holiday Village resort in Sarigerme, Turkey . 'I was taken by wheelchair to the surgery, laid out on a stretcher and taken by ambulance to hospital – I couldn't believe this was happening on our special family holiday. 'I was kept in hospital for the rest of the holiday. The break was totally ruined and none of the reps at the resort asked Nicola how I was doing or took any interest in my welfare. 'It has had an impact on more than the holiday though, as I was unable to return to work for one week due to my ongoing illness. I'm just so frustrated and want to know how I fell ill – this was meant to be a dream break but has become nothing but a nightmare.' The family claims they were served undercooked chicken and saw cats in the restaurant . Back in 2009, an outbreak of gastric illness at the same resort led to £1.7m paid out in compensation, with 595 people affected by illness. Mr Swannell said that some of the food he was served at the hotel had been undercooked. On one occasion, he claims that he cut in to some chicken and noticed blood in the middle. Some food was also said not have to have been served at the correct temperature. The family's trip to Turkey soon turned into a nightmare blighted by illness . The family also claim that food was left uncovered for prolonged periods of time and appeared as though it had been served more than once. They said that cutlery, crockery and table linen used in the restaurant was not up to standard, while they saw cats in the public areas of the hotel and in the restaurant. Mr Swannell had travelled to the Turkish resort on October 23 with his wife Nicola and their children Lewis, 13, Kyle, 13 and Keira, seven. 'The whole point of the holiday was that it was a great chance for us to get away together as a family to celebrate Nicola's 40th birthday, while we were also treating it as our belated honeymoon after we tied the knot in May,' added Mr Swannell. 'We were all so excited to be having a break and were absolutely devastated with the way everything turned out.' Experts from Irwin Mitchell's specialist International Personal Injury team have been instructed to help the Swannell family find answers as to how their trip was ruined by illness, . Jennifer Downing, a legal expert at Irwin Mitchell who is representing the family, said: 'It is very worrying to learn of Mark's illness. The Swannell's celebratory and relaxing holiday was ruined after dad Mark was hospitalised . 'We have now heard first-hand accounts regarding what the Swannell family faced and have started investigations to identify the cause of Mark's illness in order to get him and the rest of his family the answers that they deserve. 'Mark's illness was severe. He was hospitalised for several days and the illness continued after his return home. Severe gastric illness can be very serious and can cause long lasting health problems for those unfortunate enough to suffer from it. 'It is important that we find out exactly what caused Mark's illness in this case, not least so that lessons may be learned to reduce the risk of others suffering in the future like Mark and his family have. 'We would like to hear from anyone who travelled to the Holiday Village resort in Sarigerme in 2014, who could give us a first-hand account of conditions at the resort.' Mark Swannell, with his wife Nicola, and children Lewis, Kyle and Keira on their wedding day; their honeymoon to Turkey saw Mar fall horrifically ill . Expert illness lawyers have launched their own investigations into the problems and have revealed their hopes that tour operator TUI UK will work with them to determine the cause of the illness and whether it was contracted at the hotel or elsewhere. The law firm has previously helped holidaymakers secure justice regarding illness issues at the Holiday Village resort in Sarigerme in 2009; helping 595 people gain settlements of up to £25,000 each in relation to illness and related issues. A number of guests required hospital treatment in resort due to the severity of their symptoms and some were still troubled by the effects of the illness on returning home to the UK. A number of young children also required hospital treatment on their return to the UK. Over 400 holidaymakers within the group action suffered gastric illness with over 100 men, women and children suffering from infections including Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, Campylobacter and E-Coli. Over 150 holidaymakers did not suffer illness themselves, but had their holidays affected by the illness of members of their family, friends or other guests staying at the hotel. A spokesperson for TUI, who manage the First Choice and Thomson brands, told MailOnline Travel: 'We are sorry to hear of the Swannell’s experience at the Holiday Village Turkey in October. 'First Choice closely audits all resorts to which we operate to ensure that health, hygiene and comfort levels are maintained in line with industry standards. 'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.'","Mark Swannell fell ill  with diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea and lethargy .

"A controversial French comedian is facing up to seven years in prison after he was charged with inciting terrorism while 54 people have been arrested over hate-speech comments following last week's Paris massacre. Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, 48, who has convictions for anti-Semitism, has been arrested and is currently in custody at a police station in Paris. In a post on his social media account, Dieudonne appeared to sympathise with terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, who took hostages and killed five people at a kosher supermarket in Paris on Friday. Scroll down for video . Arrested: French humorist Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala wrote: 'I feel like Charlie Coulibaly', in reference to magazine Charlie Hebdo and kosher deli terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, . Prosecutors launched an inquiry on Monday into the comment by Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, who has already faced accusations of anti-Semitism and mocked the killing of U.S. reporter James Foley by ISIS. French justice officials have ordered a major clampdown on hate-speech following last week's attacks in Paris. Authorities said 54 people had been arrested for hate speech and defending terrorism since terror attacks killed 20 people in Paris last week, including three gunmen. The crackdown came as Charlie Hebdo's defiant new issue sold out before dawn around Paris, with scuffles at kiosks over dwindling copies of the satirical weekly featured an apology from the Prophet Muhammad on the front cover. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack, but French intelligence officials believe the terror group provided inspiration, rather than any logistical or financial support. Controversial: Comedian Dieudonne, 48, has previous convictions for anti-Semitism . Since the attacks, France has deployed 10,000 troops and 120,000 security forces in an area the size of Texas to protect sensitive sites, including Jewish schools and synagogues, mosques and travel hubs. French police say as many as six members of the terror cell may still be at large. France has been tightening security and searching for accomplices since the terror attacks began, but none of the 54 people mentioned Wednesday have been linked to the attacks. That's raising questions about whether Hollande's Socialist government is impinging on the very freedom of speech that it so vigorously defends when it comes to Charlie Hebdo. The Justice Ministry sent a letter to all French prosecutors and judges urging more aggressive tactics against racist or anti-Semitic speech or acts. The order did not mention Islam. Dieudonne's lawyer, Jacques Verdier told BFM-TV that arresting him for the 'Charlie Coulibaly' comment was 'completely out of proportion'. If found guilty of glorifying terrorism, Dieudonne could face up to seven years in jail. Dieudonne drew international attention last year after former France striker Nicolas Anelka celebrated an English Premier League goal with a salute popularised by him and which critics say had an anti-Semitic connotation. Dieudonne joked that his humour was no different to Charlie Hebdo, but seemingly indicated in the post that he had something in common with Coulibaly. 'Tonight, as far as I'm concerned, I feel like Charlie Coulibaly' he wrote. It was a play on words of 'Je suis Charlie' (I am Charlie), the phrase that has become a rallying cry for free speech supporters around the world following last week's massacre. Footballer Nicholas Anelka, pictured, was fined £80,000 last year for making an anti-Semitic gesture . Dieudonne said: 'For a year, I have been treated like public enemy number one, while I seek to do nothing but make people laugh. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who visited Paris's Jewish quarter in the Marais last Monday, described Dieudonne's remarks as 'contemptible'. He said Dieudonne faced court action for 'a lack of respect and a willingness to stir up hatred and division.' Confirming the opening of a criminal enquiry, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said: 'Racism, anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial, and apology for terrorism are not opinions, these are offences.' Dieudonne faces up to seven years in prison and a fine of around £80,000 under France's strict anti-terror laws. The comedian made headlines last year when French footballer Nicolas Anelka was banned for five matches by the English Football Association for using a hand gesture created by Dieudonne that many people consider anti-Semitic. Called a 'Quenelle', the gesture has been described as a reverse Nazi salute, and was used by Anelka while he was playing for West Bromwich Albion. Dieudonne's arrest came as a 'survival edition' of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine, sold out in minutes and upped its print run to five million. On the front cover is a cartoon mocking the Prophet Mohammed - an image typical of the one which led directly to an attack on their Paris offices last week in with 12 people, including eight members, of staff were murdered.

"A father-to-be was murdered by a drunk teenager who he escorted home - robbing him of the chance to meet his newborn child. Michael Lee Emmett, 29, walked the 16-year-old to his parents' house because he had been drinking, but the boy then stabbed him. The teenager, who cannot be named until a judge lifts reporting restrictions, had grabbed a knife from inside the house and the 29-year-old father-of-three suffered a deep wound to his liver and died a month later in a coma in hospital. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Michael Lee Emmett, 29, walked his 16-year-old killer home before the boy stabbed him and left him in a coma. Days before his death his daughter Lola-Grace was born to partner Natalie, but he never met her . Family man: Mr Emmett, pictured with Natalie and two sons Logan and Riley, walked his teenage killer home because he was drunk but the boy then stabbed him . His daughter Lola-Grace was born just days before he died - but he never woke to see his baby. His heartbroken partner of 13 years, Natalie Preece, took her to hospital Mr Emmett lay unconscious in his bed but he never came around again. Bereft: Ms Preece, pictured outside court, said the murder 'has robbed us of nearly everything we had that made us such a happy family' Nurses allowed Ms Preece to lay Lola-Grace in his arms so she could take a picture of father and daughter together. The teenager - who was on an ASBO at the time - today admitted murder and is facing life in prison. He will be sentenced at a later date after a psychiatric assessment. Prosecutor James Wilson said: 'The attack took place shortly after MicheaL Lee and his friend John Williams had tried to walk him home from the pub. 'They intervened after he had been abusive and aggressive.' Demolition worker Mr Emmett had seen the boy at the Stone House pub in Cefn Forest, near Blackwood, South Wales, being abusive to a woman. Cardiff Crown Court heard how they told him not to speak to women like that and a scuffle had broken out. The pair then tried to escort the drunken teenager to his family home saying: 'We'll see what your dad has to say about this.' But when they arrived, the boy ran inside and 30 seconds later emerged with a kitchen knife which he used to attack both men. Mr Emmett died of his injuries after being transferred to a specialist liver intensive care unit at Kings College Hospital in London. The father of three - who had twin sons - died after complications following a liver transplant. In a victim impact statement Natalie said: 'Losing Micheal Lee has affected every single part of my life. 'What has happened has robbed us of nearly everything we had that made us such a happy family. 'Since the boy took away my soul mate my whole life has been devastated in every way. 'Michael Lee was lying in hospital for 28 days, he was in agony this whole time, not knowing whether he would live or die. 'I had to sit with him putting on a brave face when inside I was sickened by what had been done to the man I loved the most. 'He kept asking what the date was - counting down the days until our daughter was born. 'But even that was taken away from us. Heartbreaking: His heartbroken partner of 13 years, Natalie Preece, together left, took their daughter to his hospital bedside where he lay unconscious in his bed but he never came around . 'The only photo they had together was taken just before Michael Lee died. 'The nurses let me take Lola into his room and rearrange Michae Kee's arms around her when he was braindead. 'It's not something anyone should have to do. 'Making the decision to turn off his life support broke my heart. No words can explain how painful that was.' The teenager admitted murder, wounding with intent, assaulting a police offer and breaching his ASBO. The sentence was adjourned for the preparation of a psychiatric report. Judge Mrs Nicola Davies apologised to the family who will have to wait for 'some kind of finality' before deciding on the minimum term for his life sentence.","Michael Lee Emmett, 29, walked boy, 16, home because he was so drunk .

Today thousands of spools and bobbins (known as cheeses), send the nylon and polyester yarn rushing along a labyrinth of frameworks – known as Creels – emerging to form giant webs that fan-out above the mill floor. They then feed into machines that use cameras and laser beams to constantly check up to 1000 threads at-a-time before the filaments contained in each thread are bonded in a glue and then dried.

"A woman in South Carolina has filed a missing person report on her son almost 20 years after he left home to follow the Grateful Dead. Margaretta Evans, 63, told cops in Myrtle Beach that ‘she has not seen or heard from her son since early June of 1995,’ according to a report filed on Tuesday morning. Jason Patrick Callahan, who would now be 38, is described by his mom as ‘approximately 5’ 10” to 6’ 00” in height and approximately 160 pounds’ with ‘wavy brown hair and brown eyes.’ Jason Patrick Callahan (artist impression right) who would now be 38. He is described by his mom as 'approximately 5' 10"" to 6' 00"" in height and approximately 160 pounds' with 'wavy brown hair and brown eyes' Evans ‘advised that he left to follow the Grateful Dead at that time,’” states the police report. It doesn’t explain why Evans waited two decades to report her son missing, reports The Smoking Gun. A number of Grateful Dead fans have gone missing over the years and Callahan could help solve the case of one unidentified man found dead at the side of the road after a car accident in 1995 and dubbed ‘Grateful Doe’. The victim, who was killed in a June 26 car accident in Virginia, had Grateful Dead ticket stubs in his pocket at the time of his death, as well as a note addressed to ‘Jason.’ Cops investigating the murder at the time were hindered by the fact that the injuries to the man's face were so severe that authorities were unable to release a photo of him to the public. His fingerprints were not in any law enforcement database and did not match any missing person reports either. The only thing the coroner could determine was that the young man was between 15 and 21 years of age at the time of his death. The unidentified man, known as 'Grateful Doe' attended Grateful Dead concerts in Washington in June 1995 - that turned out to be some of the last the band performed before singer Jerry Garcia died two months later . The stubs found in the man's pocket were from a Grateful Dead concert at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington D.C. on June 24 and 25, 1995. The two-day event had drawn fans from across the U.S., with an estimated 60,000 concertgoers in attendance. The concert was also of note to fans, as it was one of lead singer Jerry Garcia's last performances. He died of a heart attack less than two months later. The ticket stubs, along with the appearance of the unidentified young man, which included a Grateful Dead tie-dyed T-shirt from the 1995 summer tour, led investigators to believe the young man was a 'Deadhead,' a name given to fans of the Grateful Dead. The driver of the vehicle was a South Carolina man, 21, who fell asleep at the wheel and also died in the crash.","Margaretta Evans, 63, of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, told police that 'she has not seen or heard from her son since early June of 1995'

"To be a competent radio newsreader takes a particular skill and talent but for Nas Campanella it is even more challenging with the hurdles of a vision impairment and little sensitivity in her fingertips. The 26-year-old, from Sydney, has an inconceivable four streams of audio feeding through her headphones during the three-minute live news bulletins on Triple J which would be enough for anyone to throw in the towel. But Campanella, who also writes and cuts her own segments, reads the live reports effortlessly like a true professional despite not being able to read braille due to her condition. Scroll down for video . Despite a vision impairment and little sensitivity in her fingertips, Nas Campanella is a newsreader at Triple J . Campanella did a 12-month post in in Bombala, in rural NSW, before landing a cadetship at the ABC . She lost her vision at six months old and then diagnosed with a condition preventing her from reading braille . To help make the magic happen - Campanella uses a laptop with speech software where whatever she types and anything the mouse scans over is read out to her. The four different streams of audios when live on radio is a voice telling her what to say during the bulletin, her voice throughout the microphone reading out the news, the grabs that have been packaged before going to air, and finally a clock telling her exactly when to start and finish. 'It has taken the better part of four years to get it down pat and it's still not perfect - I can hear a voice telling me what to say so I listen and read at the same time, ' she tells Daily Mail Australia. 'I've got to be careful not to lag too far behind - it's got to be a split second after I hear it that I say it -so it's not a perfect system but it works quite well for the most part.' Needless to say by the end of a long working week, her ears need a well-earned rest from the sensory overload describing the experience as constantly stuck in 'busy traffic'. 'There is a lot going on and at the end of the week I feel like I need some quiet time,' she said. At just six months old, blood vessels burst in the back of her eyes which caused them to detach from the retina leaving her with only vision of shadow and light. To add to her difficulties, Campanella struggled to grasp reading braille until it was discovered when she was ten years old that she has Charcot Marie Tooth - a delayed sensitivity in the hands and feet due to the nerve endings. 'It was frustrating before being diagnosed because there was an assumption that I was lazy or not very intelligent,' she said. 'It takes a second for my hand to register it's on a kettle that is hot or I will be walking along sand that is really hot but it might take my feet a little while to register.' Campanella has always wanted to be a journalist since she was a child when she read newspapers . Campanella out on in the field interviewing the mayor in Bombala, in rural NSW, a few years ago . Campanella insists she would still be the same driven personality if she had her sight but admits her impairment has pushed her to be that bit stronger. 'To a certain extent I think fundamentally I'm a pretty determined, enthusiastic, pushy person anyway so I don't think that has really changed because of my vision impairment, she said. 'But I've obviously had a lot more to prove than other people had when they approached employers for a job.' When Campanella first started looking for work while still at university she was met with a lot of negativity from potential employers. Her tactic was she wouldn't mention in her application that she was visually impaired but would explain her situation if she received a call back. 'The fact that I have a vision impairment is nothing to me - there's no reason why I shouldn't be looked at but it's something that other people have found a bit confronting so it's nice to be able to get people come around to the idea,' she said. She encountered negativity while looking for work at university but that didn't stop her from achieving her goal . A keen jetsetter, Campanella's dream job would be to work as a travel writer . Thanks to great persistence it only took Campanella six months to look for a full time job when she landed a cadetship at the ABC in 2011 and has never looked back. Following her 12-month training across all mediums, she was sent to do regional post in Bega, in rural NSW, for a year before landing a role as a newsreader with Triple J. Although she finds it surprising that people see her as an inspiration - she happily takes on that role. 'I became a journalist because it's what I love to do but it's also nice to know I can help break that mould and hopefully get other people with disabilities employed as well, she said. She has always wanted to be a reporter since she was a child when she loved reading the newspaper. A keen jetsetter, Campanella's dream job would be to work as a travel writer which some people might question as she can't describe what she is seeing on her adventures. 'Using vision as a form of travel is narrow way of looking at things,' she said. 'You can describe the food you ate, the kindness of the people, the smells around you and the feeling of the sand on your feet.' Campanella said using vision as a form of travel is a narrow way of looking at things .","Nas Campanella is a Triple J newsreader despite a vision impairment .

"This is the moment a police officer kills a 22-year-old student in Brazil after leaning out of his patrol car and firing off 11 shots with his assault rifle as he thinks she is in a stolen vehicle. Haissa Vargas Motta, 22, died soon after arriving at hospital, having been shot in the ribs during the incident. A camera in the cop car captured the amazing scenes on the streets of Nilopolis, near to Rio de Janeiro. Marcio Jose Watterlor Alves is now facing a murder trial. Scroll down for video . Marcio Jose Watterlor Alves was captured on camera shooting at a car he wrongly believed to be stolen . But the car was not stolen, and was filled with a group of friends driving back from an evening at a concert hall in Brazil . The shots fatally wounded one of the girls, Haissa Vargas Motta, 22, who died shortly after arriving in hospital . He shouted 'stop' after firing off eight shots with his powerful weapon because the white Hyundai HB20 they were pursuing was a make of car that was often being stolen. Haissa's distraught friends - who were returning from a concert hall - can be heard shouting out for help after one of the bullets pierced a back seat and hit her in the ribs. Calm Alves, blamed for killing three people in four years as a police officer, insists: 'You don't do that', as one pal later sobs in the back seat of the patrol car with her head between her hands. His patrol colleague then asks her why they didn't stop before admitting: 'Nothing justifies opening fire like that, okay?' He go on to try to excuse his colleague's actions as they follow the car they had just shot at to hospital by claiming they had been previously been involved in a shoot-out with other vehicles and were feeling 'tense'. The video, which was released on Saturday, also captures the aftermath of the shooting - including the horrified reaction of Haissa's traumatised friends, who end up travelling in the back of the police car . The officers are heard questioning the friends on why the car didn't stop - the driver later revealed they thought the police were chasing a motorbike behind them . The male driver of the car Haissa was in told officers in a statement he didn't stop because he thought they were chasing a motorbike travelling behind them. An investigation is ongoing into the actions of the officers, who have been put on gardening leave since the August incident. MP Paulo Teixeira is one of the main backers of a new law which hopes to curb the number of people killed by police officers in Brazil - who are responsible for about 2,000 deaths each year . Security specialist Paulo Storani told a local paper: 'This shows a model of policing based on searching for criminals and not protecting honest citizens. 'The use of lethal force is only justified when lethal force is used against police officers. This hasn't happened here at any point. 'It was a mistake and a good example of how not to act.' Brazil's police are responsible for at least 2,000 deaths every year, and nearly 550 people were shot by police in the state of Rio alone last year. Figures from the Brazilian forum of Public Security NGO show on and off-duty Brazilian police officers killed 11,197 people in the five years to the end of 2013, compared to 11,090 people in the US in the past 30 years. The victims are generally recorded as having been 'killed while resisting arrest'. A draft law currently going through Brazil's parliament is seeking to allow more scrutiny of these 'acts of resistance', which protect police who kill in the line of action, and pave the way for detailed probes of their actions. A recent study discovered 60 per cent of 'acts of resistance' were false. MP Paulo Teixeira, one of the main backers of the new law, said: 'They were shots to the neck, the back, from behind.' Alexandre Ciconello, a human rights adviser at Amnesty International Brazil, added: 'The Brazilian police is one of the forces that most kills in the world.'","Marcio Jose Watterlor Alves fired off 11 shots at a car in August last year .

"Google has begun discussions with most of the world's top . automakers in a bid to get self driving cars on the road by 2020. 'We'd be remiss not to talk to ... the biggest auto . manufacturers. They've got a lot to offer,' Chris Urmson, . director of Google's self-driving car project, said. Those manufacturers, he said, include General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, DaimlerAG and Volkswagen AG. Scroll down for video . Google is talking to car giants including  General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, DaimlerAG and Volkswagen AG in a bid to bring self driving cars to the road in 2020. 'For us to jump in and say that we can do this better, . that's arrogant,' Urmson said. Google has not determined whether . it will build its own self-driving vehicles or function more as . a provider of systems and software to established vehicle . manufacturers. Google's self-driving prototype cars, he said, were built in . Detroit by engineering and specialty manufacturing company . Roush. GM is open to working with Google on self-driving cars, Jon . Lauckner, GM's chief technology officer, said on Monday. Urmson's expectation that the first fully autonomous . vehicles will be production-ready within five years mirrors the . view expressed a day earlier by another Silicon Valley . entrepreneur, Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla Motors Inc . . Musk, who spoke Tuesday at the Automotive News World . Congress conference, said he expects the lack of clear federal . regulations covering self-driving cars could delay their . introduction until 2022 or 2023. Urmson, however, said his Google colleagues 'don't see any . particular regulatory hurdles.' Google has been briefing the National Highway Traffic Safety . Administration, the chief U.S. auto regulator, 'from early on in . our program,' Urmson said. 'The worst thing we could do is . surprise them.' Urmson said Google is developing and refining self-driving . systems and components with such auto parts suppliers as . Continental AG, Robert Bosch, ZF . and LG Electronics. Google's prototype cars use . microprocessors made by Nvidia Corp, a Silicon Valley . chipmaker that also supplies Mercedes-Benz and other automakers. Google has already adapted cars to include its self driving technology . Continental said it began discussions in 2012 about . supplying parts for Google's self-driving car. Google asked the . German supplier to provide tires, some electronics and other . components, according to Samir Salman, chief executive of . Continental's NAFTA region. Google shortly will begin deploying a test fleet of fully . functioning prototypes of its pod-like self-driving car, which . dispenses with such familiar automotive parts as steering wheel, . brakes and accelerator pedal. While each of the Google . prototypes will have a 'test driver' on board, the cars have no . provision for human intervention in steering or braking. Google's prototype two-seater 'bubble' cars have buttons to  begin and end the drive, but no other controls. An on-board computer uses data from sensors, including radar, a laser and cameras, to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles. Under the vision unveiled by Google, passengers might set their destination by typing it into a map or using commands. The cars are also expected to be electric, capable of going 100 miles (160 km) before needing to be recharging. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in an attempt to be safer for pedestrians. The prototypes are restricted to speeds of 25mph (40 km/h) and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles. But ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use Google's extended maps service, using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights. Urmson suggested the no-frills look of the Google . prototypes, a far cry from the opulent appearance of the . self-driving F015 concept vehicle unveiled last week by . Mercedes, does not necessarily reflect the final design for . production. He described the Google prototype as 'a practical, near-term . testing platform' that will evolve over time. 'Airliners today don't look like the Wright brothers' flyer' of 100 years ago, he said. Urmson said self-driving cars represent a 'transformative' moment in the evolution of transportation, an opportunity to . extend motoring to blind, elderly and disabled persons who . otherwise could not drive. 'You're really changing the relationship you have with . transportation. You're changing what it means to get around.' Regarding Google's desire to partner with traditional . automakers and suppliers, Urmson said Detroit is more innovative . than is sometimes acknowledged. Automakers are 'doing something . incredibly complicated.'

The men have been 'free-climbing' to the 3,000-foot summit for 17 days, meaning they don't use climbing aids other than ropes only to prevent deadly falls . El Capitan: The courageous pair were closing in on the top of the 3,000-foot peak and if all goes as planned, should complete their climb this afternoon . The two climbers balance on a razor-thin ledge during the climb of the momentous El Capitan which has tested their endurance to the very limits . The Dawn Wall of El Capitan is divided into 32 climbing . pitches, which are varying lengths of rock that the climbers are . trying to master with only their hands and feet. The wall has . been scaled before, first by legendary climber Warren Harding in . 1970, but never before without climbing tools. Caldwell and Jorgeson had reached the final 11 pitches on . Tuesday after working their way past some of the toughest . stretches on the rock. Jorgeson struggled for several days last week on difficult . pitch 15, at one point being forced to rest for two days while . the skin on his fingers healed after being ripped off by . razor-sharp ledges. The two climbers are using safety ropes in case of falls, . and using ropes and other tools to move back and forth from . their campsite perched high on the rock. Because the warmth of the day can cause their hands and feet . to perspire, the two often start climbing at dusk. Caldwell and Jorgeson's attempt on El Capitan has been . closely watched in the climbing world and has drawn worldwide . news headlines and attention on social media as they made . progress toward the summit.

Jorgeson tweeted this message on Wednesday morning. The two climbers have been updating social media during the two weeks that they have made their historic ascent . Several dozen people, including relatives of the climbers, and about two dozen photographers, were gathered in the meadow looking up at the face, which is called the Dawn Wall. 'I feel like the most proud person in the world right now,' said Caldwell's 39-year-old sister Sandy Van Nieuwenhuyzen. Ms Van Nieuwenhuyzen, of Rochester, Minnesota, said she can't wait to hug her younger brother. 'I'm just going to hug. Just hug. No words necessary,' she said. 'It's such a big moment that a congratulatory hug is going to be very soothing to my big sister soul.' They started on December 27 and have been free-climbing, a technique that shuns climbing aids other than harnesses and ropes to prevent deadly falls. The world has been watching the pair's grueling half-mile journey up the peak's Dawn Wall route. But Clayton says the men won't give media interviews at the top. They plan to discuss the grueling climb on Thursday. Kevin Jorgeson, pictured wtih his girlfriend Jacqui, who is anxiously waiting for him at the top . Becca Caldwell (right), who is married to Tommy Caldwell, is also on the ground with their toddler son . Throughout the climb, both men have needed to take rest days to wait for their skin to heal. They used tape and even superglue to help with the process. At one point, Caldwell set an alarm to wake him every four hours to apply a special lotion to his throbbing hands. They also took physical punishment when their grip would slip, pitching them into long, swinging falls that left them bouncing off the rock face. The tumbles, which they called 'taking a whipper,' ended in startling jolts from their safety ropes. Eric Jorgeson, Kevin Jorgeson's father, told KGO-TV that his son has always been a climber and watching him fulfill a long-time dream makes him proud. 'He climbed everything he could think of. It made us nervous early on as parents, but we got used to it,' the father said. 'It was more other parents saying, ''Hey, your son is at the top of a backstop.''' The two started climbing El Capitan (there are more than 100 routes to the top) when Kevin Jorgeson turned 15, and it has been a birthday tradition ever since.

"HSBC has been accused of racism after it closed down accounts held by high profile Muslim groups including two charities and a mosque. The Cordoba Foundation and Ummah Welfare Trust (UWT), along with the Finsbury Park Mosque in north London, were sent letters, some without explanation, informing them the high street bank would stop offering them their services. Despite insisting that the account closures were 'absolutely not based on race or religion', the multi-national corporation has been condemned for allegedly singling out Muslims and prominent figures have called for a boycott. Scroll down for video . Controversial: HSBC has told a number of high profile Muslim organisations, including the Finsbury Park Mosque in north London, that it will be closing down their accounts . Activist Anas Altikriti, the chief executive of the Cordoba Foundation, said that he met a 'wall of silence' after he was told the account he held with his wife and two sons for 30 years would be shut down. The 45 year old, who was born in Baghdad and came to Britain as a young child, said he opened an account with the Midland Bank - now part of HSBC - as a teenager with just a £10 note. He said he was angered by the failure of the bank to give an explanation for its action. 'I am angered because of the wall of silence and the tone of the letter. It is difficult to take as I regard myself as a law abiding citizen who tries to make things better in conflicts around the world and tries to promote peace and dialogue,' he said. He flew to Baghdad in late 2005 to secure the release of British peace campaigner Norman Kember, who was being held hostage in the country. Mr Kember, along with two Canadians held hostage, were eventually released in 2006 after 117 days in captivity as the result of a British-led military operation. He added: 'When you are left with no explanation, you are left to speculate, from the whole context of the other organisations that have been targeted, I would speculate that it is because of my activism either for Gaza or for the Palestinians. 'I have also been vocal in my attacks on the governments of Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates regarding their stand on the military coup in Egypt.' Allegations: The bank have said the decisions are 'absolutely not based on race or religious grounds' Last week, the north London-based Finsbury Park Mosque, once run by hate preacher Abu Hamza, was notified of the decision to close their account on September 22. Trustee Khalid Oumar said: 'The letters that have been sent and the letters that we received do not give any reason why the accounts were closed in the first place. 'That has led us to believe that the only reason this has happened is because of an Islamophobic campaign targeting Muslim charities in the UK.' Chairman Mohammed Kozbar added: 'The bank didn’t even contact us beforehand. Didn’t give us a chance even to address their concerns. 'For us it is astonishing - we are a charity operating in the UK, all our operations are here in the UK and we don’t transfer any money out of the UK. All our operations are funded from funds within the UK.' Local MP Jeremy Corbyn also opposed HSBC's move, saying he reckons the mosque has turned over a new leaf after now-convicted terrorist Hamza was removed. Meanwhile, the UWT was told its account will be closed after two months in a letter from the bank dated July 22, in which HSBC said: 'Provision of banking services to Ummah Welfare Trust now falls outside of our risk appetite.' Registered with the Charity Commission as the Amanat Charity Trust, UWT provides emergency relief such as food and medical supplies to conflict zones, including Syria and Gaza. It is not the first time it has had its bank accounts shut down - Barclays did the same during the conflict in Gaza in 2008. A statement on the Bolton-based charity’s website said: 'As the attacks intensify in Gaza and innocent people continue to be killed, HSBC Bank has issued a two-month notice to Ummah Welfare Trust to close down its accounts. Condemnation: The bank was also criticised on Twitter, with one user accusing them of discrimination . Frustrated: Another user said she would take action of her own following the allegations . Opposition: Shaykh Muhammad Ahmad, a trustree from the Ummah Welfare Trust, has called for its supporters to join a campaign to boycott HSBC . 'This is similar to what Barclays did to Ummah Welfare Trust during the previous Gaza war in 2008. A notice then was also served for the charity to close its accounts. 'Ummah Welfare Trust reassures supporters that, in response, the charity will increase its support to the orphans, widows and injured civilians in Gaza through its other bank accounts.' Trustee Shaykh Muhammad Ahmad, in a video statement on the site, also called on its supporters to join in a 'campaign to boycott HSBC'. The bank was also criticised on Twitter. Nav Abbasi said: 'HSBC is a racist organisation discriminating against people. Another user, writing under the name Misteclatmer, added: 'HSBC are a bunch of racists'. Some HSBC customers have even decided to voluntarily close their accounts in protest at the controversial new policy. Sarah Chowdhury said: 'No need for a letter, HSBC. I’ll close my account myself.' An HSBC spokesman said: 'We do not discuss relationships we may or may not have with a customer, nor confirm whether an individual or business is, or has been a customer. In general terms, decisions to end a customer relationship are not taken lightly, but are absolutely not based on the race or religion of a customer. 'Discrimination against customers on grounds of race or religion is immoral, unacceptable and illegal, and HSBC has comprehensive rules and policies in place to ensure race or religion are never factors in the decisions we make.'","Among the accounts closed was that of Finsbury Park Mosque in London .

Their hunt for rest turned tragic when the ice collapsed under their enormous weight of more than 1,000 pounds. Fell through: Mike Carlow (left)  and Bob Pille (right) use a shovel and a prying tool to free a dead cow from the ice on White Clay Reservoir south of Pine Ridge, South Dakota on Tuesday. Last week an estimated 100 of Carlow and his brother Pat's cows wandered onto the ice, broke through and died . Loss: Mike Carlow looks over the scene at White Clay Reservoir. He estimates that he lost $300,000 worth of cattle and is uncertain how his business is going to recover . Most of the cows that fell through drowned, leaving their owners out hundreds of thousands of dollars and also heartbroken at the gruesome accident. Brothers  Mike and Pat Carlow own the herd on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, and discovered the horrific scene on January 8th during the morning feeding time. Pat had a hard time finding the cattle at first, but then eventually found a group feeding near the reservoir where there were several floating masses of dark brown. He was sickened when he realized the masses were his cows, drowned. Breaking through: Oglala Sioux Tribe solid waste director Bob Pille uses a prying tool to break ice on White Clay Reservoir on Tuesday. It's rare for cows to stray onto frozen over bodies of water . 'I've been ranching over 40 years,' Mike told the Casper Star-Tribune, 'and I don't ever remember cattle walking out on ice or falling through.' The Carlows say that most of the cows that wandered out onto the ice were prized 2-year-old bred heifers. The older ones apparently knew better than to walk out onto the ice. They say the ice was about as thick as a slice of bread, collapsing easily when forced down with 1,100 pounds of cattle. The Carlows, who are members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, estimate that the incident cost them $300,000 and they don't know how that's going to impact their business yet. 'I don't know what the hell is going to happen,' Mike said, adding that the ranching business 'was starting to really pay off. Hopefully we can stay in business. This week the Carlows have been working to extract their dead cows from the body of water, which has been a complicated job.","Brothers Mike and Pat Carlow, Oglala Sioux Tribe members, owned the cows that wandered onto the frozen reservoir last week .

"This hotel room with a picture of the Eiffel Tower hanging above the bed is where the world's most wanted woman stayed for two nights before making her way to Syria with suspected ISIS handlers. Hayat Boumeddiene arrived in the Turkish city of Istanbul just days before 17 innocent people were massacred in Paris. The 26-year-old is believed to have helped mastermind the plot, which saw her husband Amedy Coulibaly shoot dead a policewoman and execute four hostages at a Jewish-owned deli. Scroll down for video . For two nights Boumeddiene, who has been described as armed and dangerous, slept in room 102 – where a picture of the Eiffel Tower hangs above the bed . No-frills: The jihadi widow checked into Bade Otel in Kadikoy, on the Asian side of the city, on January 2 after flying into Istanbul’s Sabiha Gokcen airport . The basic room comes with a shabby bathroom, a TV, a double and single bed. Mehdi Sabri Belhoucin, a 32-year-old on the intelligent services’ watch list who travelled with her, slept in the room next door . Coulibaly, 32, was in the same terror cell as the Kouachi brothers - Cherif, 32, and Said, 34 - who killed 12 at the Charlie Hebdo magazine offices. Police are now on the hunt for Boumeddiene who is believed to have joined Islamic State fighters in Syria. Last night it was revealed that Turkish authorities were questioning a number of people who helped smuggle Boumeddiene across the border. The jihadi widow checked into the no-frills Bade Otel in Kadikoy, on the Asian side of the city, on January 2 after flying into Istanbul’s Sabiha Gokcen airport. 'Armed and dangerous': Hayat Boumeddiene . For two nights Boumeddiene, who has been described as armed and dangerous, slept in room 102 – where a picture of the Eiffel Tower hangs above the bed. The basic room comes with a shabby bathroom, a TV, a double and single bed. Mehdi Sabri Belhoucin, a 32-year-old on the intelligent services’ watch list who travelled with her, slept in the room next door  at the €38 a night hotel. The pair reportedly only left the run-down hotel to buy a mobile phone and a sim card, and to visit a local restaurant. One worker, who did not want to be identified, said: ‘She hardly left the room. They only left twice. ‘When they checked in they both handed over their passports which were photocopied. ‘The police took those and the CCTV hard drive. We can't say any more about it.’ The CCTV might also help police trace the whereabouts of four suspected ISIS handlers she met up with during her travels across Turkey.

Couple: Hayat Boumeddiene (left) with her husband Amedy Coulibaly (right), who shot dead a policewoman and executed four hostages at a Jewish-owned deli . Boumeddiene is said to have met two Turkish nationals in Istanbul, and another two in the southern city of Sanliurfa where she took a domestic flight to on January 4. Turkish media have reported that her whereabouts from January 5 to January 7 are unclear, but her phone signal was picked up in Akcakale, a town on the Syrian border, on January 8. Her last phone signal inside Turkey was picked up in this town on the same day that Coulibaly murdered a policewoman in the south of Paris. It is believed that she then crossed into Syria’s Raqqa province, to the ISIS-controlled town of Tel Abyad, by illegal means. The last recorded call from her Turkish mobile phone was picked up here on January 10 – the day after her partner was killed when the French security services stormed a kosher supermarket where he was holding 19 hostages. Analysing her mobile phone data the Turkish authorities have learned she made 18 calls from Turkey to France. It is believed her handlers have been identified but it is unclear if they have been arrested. The Turkish authorities have criticised France for their lack of cooperation. They claim they provided Paris with information relating to Boumeddiene’s whereabouts – but the French authorities thought she was inside the kosher store with Coulibaly.","Hayat Boumeddiene stayed at Bade Otel in Kadikoy for two nights .

"She is just 10 months old, but baby Juanita Valentina Hernandez weighs the same as an average five-year-old. While the youngster was a normal 6lb when she was born, she began to expand rapidly in size just weeks later. She now tips the scales at 44lb (20kgs or just over three stone) and is undergoing tests to determine the cause of her surprise weight gain. The average 10-month-old baby should weigh 19lb or 8.5kg, Tam Fry, Patron of the Child Growth Foundation, told MailOnline. Scroll down for video . Ten-month-old Juanita Valentina Hernandez weighs 44lb - or 20kg - the same as an average five-year-old . While the youngster weighed just 6lb when she was born, she began to expand rapidly in size just weeks later. The average 10-month-old baby should weigh 19lb or 8.5kg . Juanita's mother says she has no idea what caused her daughter to balloon in size. 'She was born very thin... now she is 10 months I have realised she is morbidly obese' He said: 'Weight can vary with ethnicity, but regardless of that, this child is vastly, vastly overweight. It is tragic.' Juanita's anxious mother, Sandra Franco, from Libano, Colombia, said she has no idea what has caused her daughter to balloon in size. 'When she was 15 days old she was already looking chubby, because she was born very thin,' she explained. 'Since then she's been gaining weight. Now she is 10 months old and I have realised she is morbidly obese.' She added: 'Until now I haven't been able to treat her because I am unemployed and didn't have the money.' Mr Fry explained there are various medical conditions which can cause rapid weight gain in children. These include Prader-Willi syndrome, which causes a permanent feeling of hunger and can easily lead to dangerous weight gain. Conditions such as Cushings sydrome - where high levels of the stress hormone cortisol can cause weight gain - and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, known as an 'overgrowth syndrome' can also cause children to expand in size rapidly. Last month Colombian charity Gorditos de Corazon - Chubby Hearts - brought Juanita to the capital, Bogota, where a team of specialists began treatment. Bbay Juanita is now undergoing tests to determine the cause of her surprise weight gain . Charity founder Salvador Palacio Gonzalez has made it his mission to tackle a growing obesity problem, which increasingly is affecting children. Juanita is the third baby he has seen in the last year who weighs more than 20kg. Last year the charity helped the families of obese babies Santiago Mendoza and Mayra Caicedo who had a combined weight of 41kg (90lb or more than six stone). Speaking previously about the epidemic in his country, Salvador said: 'Thousands of children in Colombia - and millions around the world - suffer with obesity. 'From Colombia we have formed an international alliance to help people who are overweight.' Despite being less than one year old, young Juanita faces a bleak future if her rapid weight gain cannot be controlled. Last month Colombian charity Gorditos de Corazon - Chubby Hearts - brought Juanita to the capital, Bogota, where a team of specialists began treatment for her obesity . The most immediate risk of Juanita being so overweight is that she may develop type 2 diabetes within two or three years, an expert told MailOnline . The charity says it is crucial to intervene before the age of one in order to prevent illnesses associated with obesity becoming a critical health risk. The most immediate risk of Juanita being so overweight is that she may develop type 2 diabetes within two or three years, Mr Fry told MailOnline. He said: 'We are already seeing children aged four with this condition, which can lead to heart disease in the teenage years.' 'Overweight children and teenagers are more likely to become overweight or obese adults. It is an extremely difficult cycle to break.' Juanita's mother added: 'To all mothers that have babies like this, please take care of our children if we don't want them to get sick. 'Please don't let them die from one of these diseases.'","Baby Juanita Valentina Hernandez was born weighing just 6lb .

"My husband Alex and I almost split up before we’d even moved in together. But it wasn’t over an affair or doubts about the relationship. It was over something far more serious — clutter. More specifically, it was a garden gnome that almost did for us. That and a lamp made of a crab suspended in plastic. I know what you’re thinking, and you’re right; these are undeniably weird objects, which is why I had shoved them into a box marked ‘charity shop’ and told Alex they had to go. Pronto. Cue a blistering row; the first skirmish in a war that began when we moved in together almost 13 years ago and continues to this day, even at the ripe old ages of 45 (me) and 47 (him). Scroll down for video . Christina Hopkinson and her husband, Alex, almost split up before they'd even moved in together because they couldn't agree on which possessions they should be keeping . I thought we were the only ones, but a recent survey found that couples have an average of 32 rows over clutter in their first year of cohabitation. Apparently, London couples, like us, squeezed together in flats the size of bath tubs, argue about it once a week. The survey estimated we throw out stuff worth £240 in that first year, which adds up to quite a few tasteless table lamps and freaky garden gnomes. Though I’d have been thrilled if it had only been £240 worth. By the time we’d got rid of his vast orange armchairs that looked like they had been lifted from the Starship Enterprise, and my grandmother’s old sewing machine, our haul surely added up to a lot more. The problem was, on deciding to live together, I wanted us to start with a clean slate — preferably one of those posh ones you serve cheese on — while Alex, ironically a divorce lawyer, wanted all his old stuff to come with him. Christina (pictured) says that 13 years later they still can't find a happy medium when it comes to the storage situation in their home . These were the remnants of his former life, he said, and precisely the things that make a house a home. But there are limits, and mine don’t stretch very far. It was when I suggested he bin the commemorative bottle of Theakston Old Peculier ale, given to him in 1988 for his 21st, that he finally snapped. We’d lived together for a week. ‘You’re trying to erase my past,’ he wailed as I eyed up his collection of 40 identical plain-white work shirts. One shirt is necessary, two offers choice — but 40? Really! ‘But all of this stuff has sentimental value,’ he protested. ‘Just as much as that box of diaries and letters you insist on keeping.’ I pointed threateningly to an ornamental silver banana. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘even that.’ The banana an ex-girlfriend had bought for him for Christmas 20 years ago still sits smugly on our kitchen windowsill. It was their constant arguing that prompted Christina to write the book The Pile Of Stuff At The Bottom Of The Stairs in 2011 . ‘Fine,’ I yelled, ‘I’ll burn my old diaries and letters if you just get rid of those cowboy boots you never, ever wear.’ Actually, we were both suffering delusions of grandeur — he that his objects were valuable family heirlooms, me that my memoirs and letters would one day be pored over by historians. Not that I was innocent of other clutter, either. Alex pointed to my collection of uneaten vitamins and half-used face serums; to the unused kettle bell and weights; to the fitness DVDs still in cellophane — all hoarded more in hope than expectation. The things we refused to part with represented the gulf between our dreams and reality. Alex had the roller blades and the tent for Glastonbury because he yearned for his carefree youth. I had the self-help videos and the size 8 dress because I yearned for a better me. It was this mess that inspired me to write my novel The Pile Of Stuff At The Bottom Of The Stairs a few years ago, about a woman driven to the brink of divorce by the rising tide of untidiness at home. I thought it was exaggerated, but this survey by the Big Yellow self storage company — who have a vested interest in resolving marital arguments about clutter, but I still believe their findings — suggests my novel nailed the problem. They found that men typically stockpile gadgets and sports toys, while women hoard the stuff invested with emotions: cards from friends, cuddly toys from former lovers, and in my case the self-improving kit that promised to deliver a shiny new life. Psychologists suggest we import this stuff into shared space in ways akin to animals marking territory — but using Beatrix Potter figurines and surf boards instead of urine. For men of a certain age, I’d also mention the phenomenon which is vinyl record hoarding.Alex is immune, but every time I walk into a friend’s house, I hear the same complaint about the endless shelves of Jam and Clash and Bowie records that are central to their partner’s sense of self. And yet no record player ever exists in these houses. Christina, picturd here with her three children, William, 7, Celia, 5 and Lydia, 3. She says 'children are the kings of clutter' with stuff toys and overflowing wardrobes constantly an issue . Every couple has a hoarder and an exorcist. Another friend says his wife feels it’s her life’s work to throw things out, occasionally when the object is still in his hand. But in my experience, the hoarder is generally the nicer half — the more tolerant and generous partner. Certainly that’s the case with us. Alex believes gifts are for keeping because you like the giver, while I have no qualms about re-gifting or donating to the school tombola. And if you think that first year together is bad, just wait for the arrival of babies. The crisis grows exponentially, like that enormous garbage patch of plastic flotsam that’s said to be bobbing about in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Children are the kings of clutter. Our three have enough animals to open a stuffed-toy zoo, and a habit of growing out of clothes — some of them cute, steeped in memories and very difficult to throw away. Christina now has a huge underground cupboard where they keep all the excess clutter in their home . I thought I’d cracked it when we moved from that first home into one with more storage. Now we have a huge underground cupboard, like a mini-cellar — the perfect graveyard for half-used tins of paint and sweaty sleeping bags. But there’s something about January that reignites the clutter argument. Over Christmas we binge on eating and buying — we stuff stomachs and houses — and come the New Year I always find myself wanting to cut the fat accumulated on both. It’s no coincidence that the languages of decluttering our homes and detoxing our bodies are so similar. We talk about purity, purging and cleaning in both cases. I want to be someone who can wear white dresses and have white sofas. I want to be Gwyneth Paltrow. Is Gwynnie’s mantelpiece covered in plastic tat from Christmas crackers? I don’t think so. The trouble is that my attempts to become a physical and domestic goddess somehow always end up with more clutter than before. I ask my husband to clear out the cupboards and then find myself filling them again with things that I’m convinced will lead us to a more organised and clutter-free life. I once bought one of those baskets that fits onto your stairs, with the aim of using it to tidy away the kids’ stuff that migrates downstairs every day. Instead, it sits unused at the bottom, waiting for someone to trip over it. I have an ever-expanding collection of lidless Tupperware boxes. I also own vacuum bags for storing unused clothes that have never been filled. Alex would be quite right if he pointed out that I am the one bringing all the clutter into the house. He’d be right, but he wouldn’t be well-advised to say it. I might just retaliate and chuck out those cowboy boots.","Christina  her husband almost split up before they'd even moved in together because of their different storage views .

"His home is crammed with piles of papers, books, toys on armchairs and clothes and ornaments on every available space. But Arthur Watson is determined to maintain the notion that a man's home is his castle - and no bureaucrat can take away his possessions. The 66-year-old has recently been served with a council notice to clear his Plymouth home of clutter because of health and safety concerns, but he has refused - claiming their direction breaks the Magna Carta. Scroll down for video . Arthur Watson has been ordered to remove rubbish and clean up his Plymouth home, but the 66-year-old hoarder claims the council order is breaching his rights which are enshrined in the 1215 Magna Carta and he should be allowed to keep hold of all of his collection . Mr Watson claims he was visited by police and Plymouth City Council who had a warrant because they believed his house was a public health hazard. He was then issued with an 'abatement notice' which ordered him to remove food waste and thoroughly clean his flat in Estover, as well as get rid of all rubbish. He told the Plymouth Herald: 'I think I have complied with most of that. 'It just seems unnecessary, a waste of public money. 'I can't see that I am a threat to public health. There's no vermin here. It's not unhygienic.' Mr Watson has accused the council of breaching article 39 of the Magna Carta, drawn up in 1215. Rooms in Mr Watson's flat are crammed full of his possessions, with piles of books and paper seen on sofas and chairs as well as on the floor . Every surface is covered with items Mr Watson has collected, with clothes and trinkets strewn on a bed and flags and banners on the walls . The pensioner has vast piles of photographs and letters which litter the floor, shelves and tables of his home but wants to keep them all . Mr Watson has bizarre collections including books, papers and leaflets (left) but insists he has cleaned up as directed by the council (right) This states that: 'No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.' 'Disseised' means 'removed' and Mr Watson claims this covers the possessions in his home, and said there had been no legal hearing of his case and his rights are therefore being breached. The rooms of his flat are packed with items, with clocks on chairs and banners and number plates on the walls. In the kitchen dozens of pots, pans and plates are stacked around the sink, with no space on any surface. The pensioner disputes claims his home and vast array of hoarded items could be a health and safety hazard and said it is hygienic and safe . Mr Watson lives in a flat in Plymouth where he has filled rooms fit to bursting with items he has collected including books and papers . Books, papers, bags and signs abound throughout the home and were seen by Environmental Health officers who were 'not pleased' with it . Some rooms are covered with clothes and dressing up items  (left) while the kitchen (right) is stacked high with pots, pans and plates . Under normal council rules householders are given a set period of time to clear up their property until police may be called to enforce it . Plymouth City Council said an abatement notice may be issued by Environmental Health Officers when they are concerned about the hygiene and cleanliness of a property. A spokesman said: 'The council may give the householder a period of time with a deadline, in which to clean their house. 'If the householder fails to improve in the period of time given by the court, the council will take further action and in some instances, involve the police where necessary.' Previously researchers from the Institute of Living, Hartford, Connecticut, found that people with hoarding disorder have abnormal activity in regions of their brains which affect decision making and can lead them to choose not to throw items away.","Arthur Watson has crammed his Plymouth home with dozens of papers toys and photographs he has collected .

"A photographer who travelled into Siberia to capture the Northern Lights risked his life by equipping himself just a sword to protect him from wolves. Russian Ruslan Akhemtsafin trekked into the remote Far Eastern Siberian Taiga region to capture his images last week. Braving temperatures as low as minus 50C - as well as bears, wolves and frostbite - Ruslan waited for several nights to take the perfect picture. Russian Ruslan Akhemtsafin trekked into the remote Far Eastern Siberian Taiga region to capture his images last week . Ruslan has explained that he regularly gets frostbite on his face, legs and fingers while waiting for the perfect shot, but said he was now used to the freezing conditions . It gets so cold in the wilderness he even designed a special fur coast for his camera to protect it from the harsh conditions. The sensational images show the natural phenomenon at its majestic best, with swirls of green, red and purple reaching out into the cold night sky. Displays of the Northern Lights occur when solar particles enter the Earth’s atmosphere and on impact emit burning gases that produce green, yellow and blue-coloured lights. The scientific term for the Lights is the aurora borealis. The traditional places for optimum Northern Lights viewings are the northern reaches of Scandinavia, Finland, Iceland, Canada and Alaska. Ruslan followed information about the weather conditions in the days before he took his photographs to give himself the best chance of capturing the images . Braving temperatures as low as minus 50C - as well as bears, wolves and frostbite - Ruslan waited for several nights to take the perfect picture . Displays of the Northern Lights occur when solar particles enter the Earth’s atmosphere and on impact emit burning gases that produce green, yellow and blue-coloured lights . The Lights themselves can only be seen between September and March each year. They are notoriously unpredictable and cannot be forecast in advance. Rusland, who lives in the village of Aikhal in Yakutia, said: ‘I love photography and I love nature. ‘So, for me it is an ideal situation where I live as it's a great region surrounded by fantastic nature and I can capture moments like the Northern Lights and share them with people. ‘Photography for me is when my soul tries to reach something so beautiful that you can't describe it with words, but can you capture it, and then share it. ‘It's never about money, it's about this moment of beauty that I've been lucky to witness.’ The 37-year-old father-of-one is an amateur photographer and he has a normal full-time day job working as an engineer at a nearby diamond mine. He was brought up in the Aikhal area having moved there from Kazakhstan with his parents and brother 30 years ago. Ruslan has been taking photographs since he was a schoolboy using his Pentax MZ-30 film camera. In 2001 he began trying to capture images of the night sky. He said: ‘My heart demanded much better results than what I was achieving with its limited abilities though. The traditional places for optimum Northern Lights viewings are the northern reaches of Scandinavia, Finland, Iceland, Canada and Alaska . ‘Four years later, in 2005, I bought my first amateur Nikon D70, which brought me a step further to what I wanted. ‘I had been dreaming about a camera that would allow me take pictures of Northern Lights within split seconds since the sky changes so rapidly that if you miss a moment your picture is gone. ‘Of course no camera is supposed to work for four, five or six hours at temperatures like -50C and below, so I have to invent some tricks. ‘I cut a sleeve off an old fur coat, turned it inside out so that the fur is inside, and then cut holes for the lenses, tripod, viewfinder and LCD monitor. Ruslan has been taking photographs since he was a schoolboy using his Pentax MZ-30 film camera. In 2001 he began trying to capture images of the night sky . Ruslan travelled into Siberia to capture the Northern Lights, risking his life by equipping himself Samurai sword to protect him from wolves . ‘That helps to protect the camera, and it gives a bit of extra warmth to my hands. ‘Taking pictures of the Northern Lights is a bit of a sport. You have to follow information about solar flashes and then possible days of the sun's winds reaching earth. 'On the day you also monitor any rise in this activity and then finally rush with all the equipment to the shooting area. ‘I do get frostbite on my face, legs and fingers while waiting for the next shot, but I am quite used to it.’ Being alone in the Taiga - which is closer geographically to the United States than it is to the Russian capital Moscow - can have its dangers and Ruslan ensures he is armed, for security. Shooting the Northern Lights is extremely difficult as the sky changes within a split second, meaning many are unable to take the perfect shot . The 37-year-old father-of-one is an amateur photographer and he has a normal full-time day job working as an engineer at a nearby diamond mine . It gets so cold in the wilderness he even designed a special fur coast for his camera to protect it from the harsh conditions . He said: ‘I have always had to carry hunting knives when going on trips in case I meet any wolves. So far our paths have never crossed. ‘I am against killing animals but these days I carry a small samurai sword, called a Vakidzasi, which I bought on a website that specialises in Japanese and Korean made weapons. ‘I bought the most expensive one they had and it was just like they promised, so it cuts bottles and logs. 'The sword weighs a bit more than a kilogram, but it's worth carrying it around as it gives me a feeling of security and confidence while I am alone in Taiga. ‘My family supports me in my passion and applauds my little victories, when I catch a very good shot. So I am a very happy man indeed.’","Ruslan Akhemtsafin trekked into the remote Far Eastern Siberian Taiga region to capture his images last week .

"Cindy Crawford embodies the word supermodel - the mere mention of her name conjures up glossy catwalk images of the heyday of modelling in the late eighties and early nineties. But the 48-year-old claims that those golden years are over and says models can no longer become superstars because big brands and magazines are only interested in celebrities. In a new interview with ES magazine, out tomorrow, Cindy discusses the death of the supermodel and places the blame at the door of reality stars, pop singers and Hollywood actresses, who regularly snap up the front covers of publications. Scroll down for video . Cindy Crawford, 49,  was one of the first ever supermodels. But she has claimed in a new interview with ES magazine that they are now extinct because magazines and advertisers now prefer reality stars, pop singers and actresses . Cindy said: 'Models are not really getting covers now, and they're not getting the big cosmetics contracts and that's where the money is - it's actresses and singers and reality TV people.' Cindy was one of the original supers, alongside women including Christy Turlington, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer, Helena Christensen and Linda Evangelista. The women dominated fashion in the 80s and early 90s and were feted by design houses like Versace, Gucci and Chanel as well the glossy magazines like Vogue, Tatler and Elle. They were also giants in the advertising world, snapping up contracts with global brands like Revlon, Levi's and L'Oreal.

Right: Cindy in Vogue in December, 1995 . Left to right: Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Eva Herzigova, and Claudia Schiffer at a Chanel show in 1995 . But since the late nineties, these domains have increasingly been taken over by celebrities from the world of acting, music and most recently, reality television. Cindy claims that appearing on magazine covers and in advertising campaigns was of little interest to actresses back in the day because they wanted to seen as serious artists. She said: 'The reason supermodels could come into being was because Hollywood actresses wanted to be taken seriously - they didn't want the red carpet to be a catwalk, which it has now become.'

And all of a sudden fashion wasn't just about Vogue and couture, there was an explosion of coverage and we were the rock stars of that.' Since those early days, the fashion world has managed to produce a couple of supermodels in the forms of Gisele Bundchen and Kate Moss. And more recently, Cara Delevingne has emerged head and shoulders above the rest of the new breed of models, bagging contracts with everyone from Topshop to Burberry.

"A police force is under fire after it asked candidates to send in a 'selfie' before applying for the role of deputy chief constable. Potential candidates have been asked to email a photograph of themselves to Humberside Police in order to request an application pack for the £117,000-a-year job. But the force is now facing a backlash, with critics branding the request 'bizarre' and 'demeaning'. Some have warned that it could lead the legality of the process to be called into question, while others said that it could effect the opportunities of women and other minority groups. 'Bizarre': Potential candidates have been asked to email a photograph of themselves to Humberside Police in order to request an application pack for the £117,000-a-year role of deputy chief constable . The advertisement was posted on the Humberside Police website with the tagline 'new year, new you, new force'. Before listing the job description and salary details, the advertisement asks applicants to 'send a photo along with your name and force' to an email address provided. The advertisement has been defended by Chief Constable Justine Curran who said it was 'vital candidates understand the importance of embracing new technology'. But it was was criticised by Conservative MP Andrew Percy, representing Brigg & Goole and the Isle of Axhome, who called the request 'strange'. He told MailOnline: 'This seems a very bizarre requirement and I cannot understand what possible benefit there can be to such an ask. 'I hope Humberside Police will reconsider this strange decision.' Hull councillor Phil Webster said it was 'demeaning and a bit discriminating', adding: 'It makes you wonder whether they want a new Robert Peel or a new Brad Pitt.' Under fire: Chief Constable Justine Curran defended the decision, saying it was 'vital candidates understand the importance of embracing new technology' John Hackston, a psychologist and head of R&D at OPP Limited, said that the photos have the potential to give away information such as an applicant's age, sex and race. He explained that while there was no indication that Humberside Police intended to make any decisions based on this information, just having it available could potentially 'be dangerous'. Meanwhile the Women's Organisation, the largest developer and deliverer of training and support targeting women in the UK, warned that it could effect the opportunities of women and minority groups. Maggie O'Carroll, the organisation's CEO, said: 'The person posting this advert has proven they are really out of kilter with equal opportunities practice and they need to get a grip. 'Who issued this or approved it? – I’m happy to come up there and help them to get into the 21st century.' While it is not illegal for an employer to ask potential applicants to send in a photo, legal complications could arise depending on how those photos are later used. Jessica Corsi, a partner at Doyle Clayton, the UK's largest specialist employment law firm, warned other employers not to follow the example of Humberside Police. Ms Corsi pointed out that it could potentially raise issues regarding discrimination and data protection. She said: 'There is the chance that unsuccessful candidates might consider that they have been discriminated against if they are not shortlisted for interview based on the photo, for instance if they are from a minority ethnic group. 'Also, there is the question of what the police do with the 'selfies' afterwards. 'Broadly speaking, under data protection laws they'd have to safely dispose of it once it was no longer necessary to them, but they are creating a compliance problem for themselves to ensure this is done correctly, especially where information is shared internally on emails. 'Apparently the police's request is because they are looking for IT-literate candidates. 'I'd strongly recommend that employers put in place a more appropriate way of testing candidates for basic IT-literacy, such as a short test before a first interview'. Jessica Cooper, Research Adviser at the CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, acknowledged the request for 'selfies' could be relevant for roles where applicants need to be comfortable with social media and technologies. Backlash: The move was criticised by politicians who branded the post, pictured, 'demeaning' and 'bizarre' She added: 'While legitimate questions should be asked about the wisdom of asking for 'selfies' in job applications, LinkedIn and Facebook – where photos are expected – are increasingly important parts of many organisations' recruitment processes, so the genie may well already be out of the bottle. But she warned that managers involved in recruiting should be given training to ensure 'that conscious and unconscious bias is not triggered by visual images of potential recruits.' Chief Constable Justine Curran defended the move saying it was 'vital candidates understand the importance of embracing new technology' as the force had invested heavily in new equipment to modernise the way they work. She explained the force had 'invested heavily in new technology in a bid to modernise the way we work'. Chief Const Curran said: 'We currently have a vacancy for a Deputy Chief Constable which is a key role within the force and as such it is vital that potential candidates understand the importance of embracing new technology within Humberside Police at the point of applying for the role. 'This is why we have created a recruitment advert that reflects our aims and ambitions as a force by encouraging candidates to get involved from the outset.'","Humberside Police posted advert for deputy chief constable on website .

"Ryanair is set to offer a new in-flight entertainment programme for passengers and contrary the airline's previous business model, it will be available free of charge. The trial is expected to start imminently on flights out of Dublin, with passengers able to log-in to the system on their tablets and smartphones. A number of pre-recorded films and TV shows will be available for viewing through the plane's internal WiFi, although full internet usage will not be permitted. Ryanair passengers will be treated to movies on demand as Ryanair test out a new entertainment package . Users will stream the programmes of their choice. A Ryanair spokesman has said that the service will be free and will be paid for by advertising. John Hurley, chief technology officer at the low-cost airline, told the Telegraph: 'It's aimed at passengers on flights of more than two or three hours. 'They'll watch a couple of adverts and will then have access to a selection of pre-recorded TV shows and films which will be streamed through internal Wi-Fi.' Users will have a selection of movies and TV shows to choose from when logging into the plane's WIFI . Ryanair is still in negotiations as to the scope of viewing that will be offered, but should the tests prove to be popular, it is expected to be rolled out to the entire fleet of 300 aircraft in 2016. Back in 2009 the Irish airline trialled the use of WIFI on board its flights for calls and texts, and floated the idea again in 2013 and last year. However, so far the company have been unable to justify this technology when matched to their low-cost flights, saying that an increase in fuel spending will be the result. Ryanair is normally associated with charging passengers for any extras it makes available . The move appears to go against the airline's previous business model of charging passengers for every extra offered. Controversial CEO Michael O'Leary was once famed for stating: 'Anyone who thinks Ryanair flights are some sort of bastion of sanctity where you can contemplate your navel is wrong. 'We already bombard you with as many in-flight announcements and trolleys as we can. Anyone who looks like sleeping, we wake them up to sell them things.'","The trial is expected to start imminently on flights out of Dublin .

"For most school children, being a millionaire is something they dream of - but for Ollie Forsyth, it could be a not-too-distant reality. The 17-year-old entrepreneur, who is studying at The Peter Jones Enterprise Academy backed by Dragons' Den's Peter Jones, is adamant he's going to hit the landmark by the time he's 20. And if his career history to date is anything to go by, he could be right. Scroll down for video . Ollie, pictured outside his home in front of his Herbie Beetle, started making money aged six when he made his parents tea and coffee and charged them 20p a cup - now his net worth is around £280,239 . Ollie said he was determined to prove his haters wrong after suffering 'constant' bullying . Ollie started his first business aged 13, an e-tailer called Ollie’s Shop, and turned over £13,000 profit in the first year. Since then, the shop turns over £30,000 annually and is doubling yearly. Ollie, from Pury End, near Towcester, Northamptonshire, told FEMAIL: 'My entrepreneurial career started aged six when I made my parents tea and coffee and charged them 20p a cup. 'I didn’t need to pay for any of the resources, just the labour. 'I had a car-wash business, sold my parents' vegetable patch yearly, and had a tuck shop at school making £7,000 a year.' Like a lot of entrepreneurs - including Steve Jobs, Nelson Rockefeller and Richard Branson - Ollie is dyslexic and admits he 'really struggled at school'. His father Angus, an insurance broker, and his mother Melanie, who runs an interior design business, sent him to the specialist Bruern Abbey School in Bicester, Oxfordshire. Ollie said: 'I went to special needs school, which helped me with my dyslexia and was fantastic. 'I then moved to Milton Abbey school in Dorset where I had the three worst years of my life, constant bullying and cyber bullying.' Ollie didn't talk to anyone about the issues, but finally plucked up the courage to talk to the school's American counsellor who told him: ‘You've just got to go for it and you will be a billionaire one day, my friend.’ 'This is what drove me to success,' Ollie said. 'I was bullied that much, I wanted to end my life, but, I said to myself: ""I am going to be a millionaire one day and those bullies will be working for me"".' Undeterred by struggles with school work, the youngster turned to business and was determined to succeed, counting Virgin boss, Sir Richard Branson, as his idol.

"The FBI today arrested a 20-year-old radicalized Muslim convert from Ohio for allegedly plotting to carry out a terrorist attack on the US Capitol. Christopher Lee Cornell, of Green Township, was taken into custody by federal agents on charges of attempting to kill a government official and possession of a firearm, according to a criminal complaint. Government documents filed in the case indicate that the 20-year-old Cornell, who also goes by the name Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, allegedly planned to detonate pipe bombs in the Capitol and then open fire on people fleeing the building in the aftermath of the blasts. Scroll down for video . Plot foiled: Christopher Lee Cornell, a 20-year-old Ohio man, has been charged with plotting to carry out a terrorist attack on the US Capitol in Washington DC. This image shows what appears to be Cornell's arrest Wednesday . Cornell first showed up on the FBI's radar several months ago after he sent out a tweet in support of violent 'jihad', according to government documents. An investigation into Cornell's activities has revealed videos and other online statements backing the deadly extremist organization ISIS, also known as ISIL or Islamic State. First picture: Cornell, who also goes by the name Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, is pictured here in a booking photo released by Butler County Sheriff's Office Wednesday night . According to the FBI, the 20-year-old also exchanged messages with an undercover federal informant about his desire to launch Islamic State-style attacks on US soil. 'I believe that we should just wage jihad under our own orders and plan attacks and everything,' Cornell allegedly wrote in August. 'I believe we should meet up and make our own group in alliance with the Islamic State here and plan operations ourselves.' In instant messages to the undercover informant, Cornell indicated that while he did not have support to conduct an attack on behalf of any group, 'we already got a thumbs up from the Brothers over there and Anwar al Awlaki before his martyrdom and many others.' Awlaki, an American-born radical imam, was killed in a US drone strike in Yemen in 2011. The Islamic State militant organization, which broke with the al-Qaeda network and took control of large parts of Iraq and Syria, has drawn jihadi fighters from across the Muslim world and Europe. It has been blamed for violence such as the beheadings of foreign captives including a former U.S. soldier turned aid worker and two American journalists. Government officials say Cornell’s suspected terror plot was in the early stages of development; he planned to carry out an attack in December 2015. The FBI says the public was never in danger and he never made it to Washington. Cornell's arrest early Wednesday morning came at the Point Blank store where he allegedly purchased a pair of M-15 semi-automatic rifles. Early this evening, the Cincinnati station WKRC shared a photo depicting what is believed to be the moment of Cornell's arrest at the gun store. Targeted: Cornell allegedly planned to blow up pipe bombs in the Capitol and open fire on fleeing government employees sometime in December 2015 . Caught red-handed: Cornell was arrested Wednesday morning at the Point Blank gun store in Cincinnati after purchasing a pair of semi-automatic rifles . ‘The alleged activities of Cornell highlight the continued interest of U.S.-based violent extremists to support designated foreign terrorist organizations overseas, such as ISIL, by committing terrorist acts in the United States,’ stated a bulletin issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security within hours of Cornell's arrest. ‘Terrorist group members and supporters will almost certainly continue to use social media platforms to disseminate English language violent extremist messages.’ A yearbook photo obtained by WKRC shows Cornell in 2012 as a senior at Oak Hills High School. Speaking to the station following his son's arrest, Cornell's father, John Cornell, called the 20-year-old 'Mama's boy' and a 'homebody' who spent much of his time alone. According to Mr Cornell, his son took up interest in Islam only about two months ago - a timeline that contradicts the FBI's narrative. Role model: Cornell allegedly told the informant that radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki had been in favor of terrorist attack before his 'martyrdom' Government documents indicate that Cornell allegedly planned to detonate pipe bombs in the Capitol and then open fire on people fleeing the building in the aftermath of the blasts . The criminal complaint alleges that the FBI informant began supplying agents with information about Cornell last year in return for favorable treatment in an unrelated criminal case. According to the informant's legal testimony, Cornell researched the construction of pipe bombs, saved up money to purchase semi-automatic rifles and 600 rounds of ammunition and made plans to travel to Washington on a reconnaissance mission. In a meeting with the informant in November - one of four the two had last fall - Cornell said he considered members of Congress to be his enemies, according to the documents. Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, praised the FBI and other law enforcement agencies for their work 'to thwart this potential terrorist act. It is an important reminder of the very real threat that radical Islam continues to pose to the homeland.'","Christopher Lee Cornell, also known as Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, charged with attempting to kill a government official .

"Sitting in the casualty department of one of the best-known hospitals in Britain, I can’t help but notice it’s packed to the rafters. Yet it’s not a hectic Saturday night, but a Monday lunchtime at the beginning of December and everyone seems sober. Despite this, I struggle to find a seat, even though it is obvious I’m in deep shock and on the point of passing out in agony. This is by far the worst pain I’ve ever suffered. I know my upper arm is broken — I fell off a step and heard the crack — and fully expect at least a four-hour wait. A woman having a cigarette outside warned me as I arrived: ‘Hope you’ve set aside the whole day. I’ve been waiting ages!’ Jenni Murray (pictured) fell off a step and broke her arm, she was treated at North London's Royal Free Hospital . As I look around the crowd, I see little evidence of painful injury. I ask the woman next to me what she’s come for — a headache, no less. ‘No point calling the GP. You can never get seen,’ she says. It’s the same story with the worried-looking father a few rows back. With a feverish young son lying listlessly on his lap, he explains he came straight to the hospital. He didn’t even think to start with his GP. It’s clear evidence that casualty is becoming the first port of call whether it’s an accident, emergency or just feeling a bit poorly. No wonder the staff at the Royal Free Hospital in North London look so strained. My worries about a long wait are mercifully unfounded — obviously, a genuine crisis is attended to as a priority. Within 20 minutes I see a triage nurse and am sent for an X-ray. A broken humerus is confirmed and I’m sent home wearing a sling with the hope the break is clean and will begin to mend. I’m to see the consultant the following week in the fracture clinic. So far, for a badly injured woman in her 60s, so good. It’s been a long time since I was an emergency case. It was the early Nineties. I’d slipped down a set of stairs and not so much broke, as demolished, my ankle. I recall a quick consultation, instant admission, pins and screws and a two-week stay with good care. But, as I was to discover, it’s a very different story now. I’ve always been a staunch supporter of the NHS, a service that was introduced just two years before my birth in 1950, and made all the difference in the world to my parents’ peace of mind. For the first time in their lives, they didn’t have to worry about paying for the inoculations — polio, diphtheria and smallpox — that were now available to every child, free of charge. It never occurred to me to consider private medicine as I got older. I had my two sons on the NHS and received kind, attentive and sympathetic care before, during and after birth. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer nearly ten years ago, I was given a speedy referral by an excellent GP and instant admission for a mastectomy into The Christie Hospital in Manchester. The surgical care was first rate and there was never a shortage of nurses to attend to me. I’ve defended the NHS to any critic. Free health care at the point of need seems to me the very essence of a caring community. ‘So what,’ I’ve said testily to people complaining about the wait in a clinic for a post-operative cancer check-up. ‘You’re getting top-class treatment for free! What have you got to whinge about?’ But now I’m worried that this precious service is in danger of imploding. Admittedly, my casualty experience at the Royal Free was faultless and, a week later, when I attend the fracture clinic, I have nothing to complain about. The wait was no more than half an hour, the X-ray pretty quick. The consultant recommended surgery. I was to be admitted on the Wednesday evening and was told to get my necessary blood tests done in advance. And that’s when the trouble started. The blood test queue filled a large waiting room and stretched, snake-like, along the corridor. My number was 365 — and 210 had just been called. It was two-and-a half hours before they got to me. Just as well I’d set the whole day aside. Wednesday came and I still had no information about when and where, or indeed if, I should turn up that evening. I called admissions. They hadn’t a clue. I emailed the surgeon’s secretary, and at 5pm I finally had a call. I was to arrive at the orthopaedic ward around 7.30pm. They’d finally found me a bed. The nurses could not have been more welcoming or attentive, but I soon learned that the chief nurse in the department had been on duty since 8am. It was now going on for 8.30pm, and when the consultant popped by, he casually suggested she might consider going home at some point. Jenni was diagnosed with a broken humerus, she has long been a supporter of the NHS especially after the care she received when she was suffering from breast cancer nearly ten years ago . I think the poor thing finally left around 10pm. I got the impression 14-hour shifts were far from unusual. The staff nurse who came to check me before lights out looked equally exhausted. He was Portuguese and told me he’d be the only qualified nurse on duty overnight, with the support of three or four health care assistants, in charge of 16 patients. Most of Thursday was a blur. Anaesthetic, surgery, recovery and then a room on the cardiac ward to monitor me overnight because no beds were available in orthopaedics. After a blissful night on morphine, I was moved to the general ward, still in the cardiac department, to be tended by a group of half a dozen nurses and health care assistants. They were rushed off their feet, making sure everyone — four in my room and a number of other bays — was washed, fed, watered and taken to the toilet. No patient was left wanting, but the staff looked as if they should be the ones in bed. And then there was Alice. She was in the next bed. She was in her late 70s, had suffered a heart attack and was obviously not in full control of her mental faculties. She shouted constant abuse at the nurses who tried their best for her. Jenni admitted that her casualty experience at the Royal Free (pictured) was faultless and, a week later, when she attended the fracture clinic, the wait was no more than half an hour . She was especially troublesome at night, so I and the other two women — a hotel proprietor from Blackpool with a rare heart condition and a quiet elderly woman — didn’t get much sleep. Alice’s finest hour came around 3am on my fifth and final night. She shouted more abuse at the nurses, insisting on getting out of bed. I got up and walked to the corridor for a break and a cup of hot chocolate, when a mug flew past my ears and smashed against the wall. More were thrown around the ward: Alice had been saving them up, hiding them who knows where, for a major assault. Three huge security men didn’t know what to do as she rampaged. I suggested to a distraught young nurse to call psychiatry. A doctor arrived after about half an hour — it’s a huge hospital — as we all looked on in horror at the sight of Alice losing it. She was given a drastic chemical cosh and it worked. I’m sure the young nurses are used to dealing with crises, but even they seemed shocked and at a loss to know how to deal with such violence. Next morning, when I woke and made my way to the loo, the Blackpool woman warned me: ‘Don’t go in there!’ At some point in the night, Alice had managed a dirty protest in the bathroom. She should never have been in a room with other patients. I don’t know why she wasn’t in a room of her own. Shortage of beds and staff again, I guess. When I left, I was discharged by a junior doctor who did not give me any paperwork to tell me what would happen next. I had to ping off another email to the consultant’s secretary again to find out. I needed the GP to trim stitches and should have physiotherapy after four weeks, she said. I wonder how many patients leave in ignorance because they don’t know who or how to ask? I will continue to support the principle of the NHS. I certainly won’t be arguing in favour of paying £5 to been seen in casualty, as some have suggested. Free at the point of need is what we are so proud to maintain. But investment in staff is unquestionably a priority. These nurses are desperate to do a good job, but there are too few of them to service the need. I would plead with anyone who feels ill to make their first port of call their GP so that emergency departments can do the job they’re set up to do; deal with emergencies. As for the shortage of beds, we must have effective social and convalescent care to end bed-blocking. And those overworked nurses? Let’s stop picking holes in this magnificent service we are privileged to have at our disposal, and say a collective thank you to those working so hard. Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely hope I don’t see any one of you again, for a long, long time, but you have my gratitude and admiration. I hope it sustains you through tonight’s 14-hour shift. Alice’s name has been changed.","Jenni has been a longstanding supporter of the NHS and it's treatment .

"Chipotle says it stopped serving pork at hundreds of its restaurants after suspending a supplier that violated its standards. Chris Arnold, a spokesman for the burrito chain, told The Associated Press it's the first time the company stopped serving a topping for its burritos and bowls. He said Chipotle learned of the violation by the supplier on Friday through a routine audit, and did not have a timeline for when carnitas would return to affected stores, about a third of its total base. 'It's hard to say how long it will last,' he said. Removed: Chipotle said a third of its stores are no longer serving the carnitas filling because of concerns over how pigs were being treated . In New York City on Tuesday, a sign on the door of a Chipotle location stated: 'SORRY, NO CARNITAS.' Arnold said most of the issues related to the violations concerned the housing for the pigs. Chipotle demands that its suppliers raise pigs in humane conditions with access to the outdoors, rather than in cramped pens. On other occasions, Chipotle customers may have noticed signs saying a restaurant is serving meat that doesn't meet the company's 'responsibly raised' standards. That's typically because Chipotle has trouble securing supplies of beef raised without antibiotics or hormones, Arnold said. The company then serves beef that was 'conventionally raised.' That is not happening with the carnitas, however. 'In this case, we won't make that kind of substitution,' Arnold said in an email. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. had 1,724 restaurants as of last September. The Denver-based chain has enjoyed strong sales growth, in part by positioning its food as a higher quality alternative to traditional fast-food restaurants. In the latest quarter, sales surged 19.8 percent at established locations. Paul Shapiro, vice president of farm animal protection for The Humane Society of the United States, said that most breeding pigs in the country are kept in gestation crates with concrete floors. Pigs that are raised with access to the outdoors or bedding represent a 'very small portion of the pork industry,' he said. Even among farms where pigs have better conditions, Shapiro said access to the outdoors can vary. 'It doesn't mean these animals are living in ideal conditions on Old MacDonald's farm,' he said. As for Chipotle, Arnold said the company is looking at a variety of ways to remedy its carnitas shortage, including the use of different cuts of pork or increasing orders from other suppliers. He said he hopes the supplier in question will fix its issues and eventually come 'back on board.' Arnold said the carnitas topping typically accounts for about 6 to 7 percent of entree orders; chicken is the most popular topping.","Carnitas topping has been withdrawn from a third of US Chipotle stores .

"Scientists in Denmark believe an antidote for cocaine could be possible, after they identified a key protein that helps cause addiction (file picture) It is an addiction that tears families apart, destroys lives and leads to financial ruin. Now, a team of scientists believe they are a step closer to developing an antidote to cocaine addiction. Researchers at the University of Copenhagen have identified a protein - a dopamine transporter - that could help in the development of future treatments. Currently no medical treatment exists to combat a reliance on the drug. In theory, the new treatment would work in a similar way to how methadone works for heroin addicts. In essence, the treatment would stop the drug having any pleasurable effect. Associate professor Claus Juul Loland, from the department of neuroscience and pharmacology, said though the drug is not a 'wonder drug' it would work in a similar way to how methadone is used to treat heroin abuse. 'If we have a better understanding of the dopamine transporter function we will become more proficient in developing an antidote against cocaine addiction,' he said. 'It would aid in the treatment of cocaine addiction, but the patient would have to be willing to go to rehab and other actions have to be taken in addition to this,' he told Medical Daily. He added: 'We found two amino acids in the proteins that dynamically breaks and forms an interaction. 'The dynamic is therefore crucial for the transport process.' Cocaine acts as an inhibitor of the dopamine transporter. Dopamine is a signalling molecule in the brain which is linked to a person's sensation of reward, motivation, and addiction. The newly-discovered protein acts as a 'vacuum cleaner' removing the released dopamine, thereby controlling its signalling. The scientists discovered an interaction, a so-called gate, which controls access for dopamine to its binding site in the protein. But the scientists discovered other inhibitors, which though they bind to the dopamine transporter with the same strength as cocaine, do not provoke the same simulatory response, when tested in rats. 'Our objective here is that cocaine will not then work any more as the antidote will inhibit the stimulatory response of taking this drug,' concluded Professor Loland. He added further research will be necessary. The results have been published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. The protein - a dopamine inhibitor - could help in the development of future treatments. Dopamine, pictured, is a signalling molecule in the brain which is linked to a person's sense of reward, motivation and addiction .","Antidote to cocaine addiction is a step closer, say Danish scientists .

"A medal struck by the Royal Mint to mark 70 years since the end of the Holocaust was unveiled last night, with the first presented to some of the dwindling number of survivors. Chancellor George Osborne and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who commissioned the silver medal, said it was vital to keep ‘retelling’ the story of the murder of six million Jews. The first of the run of medals were awarded to survivors and supporters of the Holocaust Education Trust in Downing Street last night, and a limited number will be on sale on the Royal Mint’s website. The obverse features the words ‘Liberation 1945’ in a typeface reflecting that used at Belsen, breaking through barbed wire. The reverse commemorates the 11th Armoured Division, the British forces that liberated the camp, and a stylised eternal flame that has come to symbolise the Holocaust victims . The obverse features the words ‘Liberation 1945’ in a typeface reflecting that used at Belsen, breaking through barbed wire. The reverse commemorates the 11th Armoured Division, the British forces that liberated the camp, and a stylised eternal flame that has come to symbolise the Holocaust victims. Among those who were presented with the first medals were Gena Turgel, 90, who was liberated from Bergen-Belsen in April 1945 . Having lost seven of her eight siblings and a tiny nephew in the Holocaust. Incarcerated in three concentration camps, she survived a trip to the gas chamber and forced marches between the camps and now lives in England. Ben Helfgott , 85, a Polish born British Holocaust survivor and former champion weightlifter, was another recipient at last night’s reception in Downing Street. Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, which takes schoolchildren on visits to Auschwitz, said: ‘We are delighted that the Chancellor has announced the commissioning of a special commemorative medal to mark 70 years since the end of the Holocaust. ‘This will mean a great deal to the Holocaust survivors who rebuilt their lives in Britain after losing their homes, families and communities at the hands of the Nazis. The commemorative medal is a perfect tribute for this significant anniversary year.’ Chancellor George Osborne, with Karen Pollock (centre right) the Holocaust Educational Trust Chief Executive, presented the medals in Downing Street to (left to right) Harry Spiro, Gena Turgel (seated), Zigi Shipper, Mala Tribich, Ben Helfgott and Hannah Lewis . Mr Osborne said: ‘Here we stand in Downing Street in tribute to fight against Nazism. In tribute to the millions who died. In tribute to the brave survivors. In tribute to the liberators. ‘And by our very standing in this place – you the survivors, you the liberators, you the people who keep the memory alive, and me and my colleagues, the democratic representatives of a free nation. By our very standing we symbolise that freedom won and tyranny lost. And we restate our determination that freedom will always triumph.’ Mr Pickles added: ‘Shining a light on the darkness of the Holocaust is no easy task. Not easy because it involves reliving one of humanity’s most shameful periods. It means retelling stories that are sometimes too shocking for words. ‘But there is only one way to avoid such monstrosities again – through constant vigilance for the first signs of intolerance.’ The presentation came as David Cameron sought to reassure Jewish leaders of Britain's ability to protect the community following the terror attacks in Paris. ‘We have to recognise that in a modern democracy you can never protect every threat, but we should do everything we can and be as vigilant as we can to help reassure,’ Mr Cameron said after a meeting in Number Ten. The Prime Minster said it had been deeply moving to be in Paris on Sunday for the unity marches and recalled seeing people holding signs reading ‘Je Suis Juif’. ‘We should use the momentum of those great demonstrations to emphasise what we are in this country: a very successful multi-ethnic, multi-faith democracy,’ he said. The meeting also discussed rising antisemitism in Britain and growing numbers of anti-Israel boycotts on university campuses.","Medal struck by the Royal Mint to mark 70 years since the Holocaust .

"British Airways is suspending all of its flights between London and two West African nations for the rest of the year as the region struggles to contain the worst ever outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus. The airline initially said it was halting its service between Heathrow Airport and Liberia and Sierra Leone until the end of August due to ‘the deteriorating public health situation in both countries’, but it confirmed that it is extending the suspension until 31 December. The decision was announced by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office in an updated travel advisory for Britons. Grounded: British Airways has extended its flight ban for two countries dealing with an Ebola outbreak . In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, British Airways said: ‘The safety of our customers, crew and ground teams is always our top priority and we will regularly reassess the routes in the coming months. ‘Customers with tickets on those routes are being offered a full refund or a range of rebooking options.’ British Airways, the national flag carrier for the UK, normally operates four flights a week between Heathrow Airport and Monrovia, Liberia, with a stopover in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Air France has suspended its flights to and from Sierra Leone, and the French government has urged French nationals to leave Sierra Leone amid concerns about the epidemic that has killed more than 1,400 people in four countries. Several airlines have stopped flying into and out of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria as they grapple with the worst outbreak since the virus was first detected in 1976. British Airways followed the lead of Emirates, which became the first major international airline to cancel flights, and African carriers Arik and ASKY. Epidemic: More than 1,400 have died during the worst Ebola outbreak since the virus was first detected . Kenya Airways and Korean Air Lines have also halted flights to the region. The current outbreak is believed to have started in Guinea last December. The World Health Organisation said the risk of transmission of Ebola virus disease during air travel is low and it does not recommend any ban on international travel or trade. The FCO is encouraging people to refer to the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s website before travelling to the affected countries, but it has not implemented any travel restrictions. The FCO issued a warning on its website: ‘You should carefully assess your need to travel to these countries. If you do decide to travel, you should make sure you have adequate arrangements in place for onward travel/exit and have adequate emergency health provision.’ Ebola is spread by close contact with organs or bodily fluids from an infected person or animal – living or dead – and there is no proven cure or vaccine. The highly transmissible virus causes haemorrhagic fever that kills as many as 60 per cent to 80 per cent of the people it infects in Africa.","British Airways says it has cancelled all flights until 31 December .

"Shaker Aamer, the last British resident held in Guantanamo Bay, has been brutally beaten on film at least 315 times by guards, it has emerged. As David Cameron prepared to fly to Washington for talks with Barack Obama seeking his release, it was revealed the father-of-four is routinely assaulted by guards for peaceful protests. Campaigners said the 46-year-old terror suspect, imprisoned at the notorious military camp without charge or trial for almost 13 years, was subjected to a violent procedure known as a ‘forcible cell extraction’ by teams of riot officers. Scroll down for video . Campaigners claim that Shaker Aamer, pictured, is assaulted on a regular basis by U.S. military guards . Last night  they urged the Prime Minister, who will raise Mr Aamer’s plight at the White House tomorrow, to demand video footage showing chilling evidence of his ill-treatment. The Prime Minister is travelling to the US for his last scheduled encounter with the President before May’s General Election. He has pledged in a letter to ‘seek further assurances’ from Mr Obama that Mr Aamer – who vehemently denies having close links to Osama bin Laden – has not been the victim of abuse at the controversial naval facility in Cuba. British officials are attempting to persuade the US that they can deal with any security concerns about his return to London. Mr Aamer, who the US military believed was a ‘recruiter, financier, and facilitator’ for Al Qaeda, is understood to have agreed to be placed under a strict security regime if he returns to London, including T-Pim control orders, curfews and restrictions on who he can meet and telephone and internet use. Last night Clive Stafford Smith, of human rights charity Reprieve, which represents the Londoner, said video tapes recorded during the cell extractions would offer proof that baton-wielding guards had beaten his client. Until now, ministers have been unwilling to ask the US for the images, the existence of which was established in a separate court case of a Syrian detainee on hunger strike at Guantanamo. Mr Stafford Smith said that following last month’s DEC bombshell US Senate intelligence committee report which exposed the scale of CIA torture of terror suspects, it was vital Mr Cameron raised the issue of abuse. He said: ‘In the wake of the shocking torture report, the Prime Minister is right to look into the mistreatment of Shaker Aamer at Guantanamo. ‘We will see whether he is told the truth, or shown the 315 videos of Shaker being abused. Shaker continues to be subjected to regular violent assaults simply for peacefully protesting his detention without charge or trial. ‘How in the name of all that is holy can the British governemnt refuse even to ask to see known physical evidence of the on-going abuse of a British resident in US custody? ‘Such a request would doubtless go a long way towards ending some of the mistreatment. I do not understand the British government’s failure in Shaker’s case: how can it be that our closest ally can continue to abuse a British resident and we are powerless to persuade them to stop?’ In declassified phone conversation with his lawyer Mr Aamer, a Saudi citizen who has resident status in the UK, said ‘forced cell extractions’ involved a team of six guards. For frequent searches, detainees are ordered to lay down on their stomach, put their hands behind their back and cross their legs. In the event of any resistance, the guards will painfully push pressure points on the body, shackle a captives arms and legs, and strike out to get the prisoner to comply. Critics have dubbed the practice the ‘Gitmo [Guantanamo] Massage.’ Mr Aamer, 46, from Wandsworth in South London, where he has a British wife and four children, has twice been cleared for release from the prison by the Bush administration in 2007 and again by President Obama in 2009. The US administration has said it is ‘aggressively pursuing the transfer’ of the detention camp’s remaining inmates. The number has plunged to 127 and President Obama has vowed to close Guantanamo before the end of his term in office. But Mr Aamer’s detention has been extended as US officials insist he must go back to Saudi Arabia where he was born, rather than re-join his family in Britain. He has repeatedly refused to be dumped in the Middle Eastern emirate, amid serious concerns he would face torture. Mr Aamer’s lawyers claim the intention is to silence their client - who claims to have witnessed torture in the presence of a British security official. But a Congressional row in the US could curtail any possibility of release. Republican senators have introduced new legislation to clamp down on President Obama’s ability to transfer terror suspects out of Guantanamo in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. It would prohibit the transfer of terror suspects considered to be high or medium-risk – which Mr Aamer falls under. Saudi-born Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and married, securing leave to remain in Britain. In 2001, he was detained in Kabul after, his representatives claim, going to Afghanistan to carry out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity. Prime Minister David Cameron, left, said he would raise Mr Aamer's case with President Barack Obama, right . His supporters claim he was captured by bounty hunters, handed to the US military for $5,000 and then tortured at a secret ‘black site’ prison - effectively a dungeon - at Bagram air force base. He was then sent to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002. The detention centre was opened in the wake of the September 11 attacks to hold ‘enemy combatants’ in what the US called a war on terror. Kate Allen, Amnesty International’s UK director, said: ‘David Cameron shouldn’t leave Washington without a cast-iron guarantee over Shaker Aamer’s release from Guantánamo Bay. ‘This terrible farce has gone on for 13 miserable years. We need a date - no more delays, no more excuses. ‘Mr Cameron needs to make it absolutely clear to the US President that Shaker’s release should be a matter of days in coming, not weeks or months.’ In a letter to Reprieve, the Prime Minister said: ‘Shaker Aamer’s case remains a high priority for the UK Government. We will continue to raise it with the US at the highest levels to make clear that we want him released and returned to the UK as a matter of urgency.’","Shaker Aamer has been held by U.S. forces in Guantanamo Bay since 2002 .

"The widow of a man who Jennifer Aniston recently called 'the one' in an interview is slamming the actress over her comments. Mujah Maraini-Melehi, who was married Daniel McDonald and had two children with the actor before he tragically passed away, is calling out the 'media savvy' actress saying 'she was not present during his difficult illness'. McDonald, who dated Aniston for five years in the '90s, died in 2007 of brain cancer. Scroll down for video . Too soon: Jen was talking about McDonald when she recently described a former boyfriend who was 'the one' but who died an early death due to brain cancer, according to a source close to the actress. Before his death in 2007, McDonald married Italian actress and film maker Mujah Maraini-Melehi. Their family pictured above . The one that got away: Jennifer Aniston (left) dated Broadway actor Daniel McDonald (right) for four years in the early 90s, but the two broke up just before she landed a part on Friends . 'He would not approve of all this uninvited attention,' said Maraini-Melehi of McDonald . In an interview with the New York Times as part of her aggressive push to grab an Oscar nomination for her role in the film Cake, Aniston said of McDonald, who she dated in her early twenties: 'He would have been ""the one"". But I was 25 and I was stupid.' She went on to say; 'He must have sent me Justin to make up for it all.' This in reference to the actress' current fiancé, Justin Theroux. Maraini-Melehi took to Facebook after seeing Aniston's interview and said; 'I am very upset that the media is exploiting Daniel’s memory in connection to Jennifer Aniston. 'What is precious shines in our hearts and should not be splayed for everyone’s consumption in the media this way.' She then goes after Aniston, saying; 'Why now? I wonder. After decades of stardom, she is media savvy enough to know that any casual comment she makes becomes front page tabloid news. Jennifer Aniston is Jennifer Aniston, and that means that anything that she says about her love life to any journalist, even someone as reputable as New York Times’ Frank Bruni, will be later dissected and exploited.' Aniston has yet to respond to these comments. Maraini-Melehi then adds: 'It pains me to read the headlines that allude to her losing him tragically when she was not present during his long and difficult illness.' She also reveals that she reached out to Aniston after McDonald died to see if the actress wanted any photos he had of the two back, but she never responded. Maraini-Melehi and McDonald were married until his death in 2007 . Big relationships: Aniston would go on to become engaged to actor Justin Theroux (left) and was previously married to Brad Pitt (right) As for McDonald, Mariana-Melehi, who married Luca Aureggi in September 2014, says, 'He would not approve of all this uninvited attention.' ‘Jennifer never stopped loving Daniel, but things were happening very fast with her career by that time – it was just a year before she landed Friends,' a source previously revealed to DailyMail.com. 'She’d moved to Los Angeles, and Daniel stayed on in New York and was doing Broadway. ‘After Dan and Jen split, she went on to date and become engaged to actor Tate Donavan, but I don’t think she ever got over letting Dan slip through her fingers.’ Added the source; ‘Daniel was a lovely guy. He was open, honest and funny, and I know Jennifer really loved him. The timing was just off for them I guess.' In light of what’s been happening around the world, this may seem like a very trivial and superficial post. This past 24 hours have been very difficult for me….. I am very upset that the media is exploiting Daniel’s memory in connection to Jennifer Aniston. What is precious shines in our hearts and should not be splayed for everyone’s consumption in the media this way. Why now? I wonder. After decades of stardom, she is media savvy enough to know that any casual comment she makes becomes front page tabloid news. Jennifer Aniston is Jennifer Aniston, and that means that anything that she says about her love life to any journalist, even someone as reputable as New York Times’ Frank Bruni, will be later dissected and exploited. My heart aches to see our tragedy of losing Daniel to serve the media’s hunger for sensationalism. I remember how journalists often called our home to ask Daniel for information about Jennifer, and being the gentleman that he was, he would always decline to comment on anything at all. I imagine he would be appalled to be caught up in this media circus, especially after he had found Love and built a family of his own. His love is part of our fabric -- part of me , part of Fosco, part of Ondina. Please respect our love and especially our Loss. The children lost their father. I lost my partner. I am sorry that Jennifer did not realize the treasure that was Daniel when she had the chance, long before he and I met and long before he died. It pains me to read the headlines that allude to her losing him tragically when she was not present during his long and difficult illness. That said perhaps Daniel’s gift was to teach her how to love and appreciate Justin Theroux. I know how much Daniel cared about her, and how protective he was of her. That was part of what I loved about him. I find it very hard to believe that she may not have married Brad Pitt had Daniel and I not married months before as some unnamed “sources” declared to the Daily mail on line. After Daniel died, I reached out to her to give her back all the photographs from the time they were together. I never got an answer back from her. Please ignore the gossip and remember what is essential; the music in Daniel’s heart lingers on in us, in his dear friends, his mother Pat, his siblings who miss him every day, his cousins, his nieces and nephews, his colleagues, his fans, his children, and me.","In a recent interview, Jennifer Aniston spoke of a ex-boyfriend who was 'the one' but who died of brain cancer .

"Google has asked the High Court to throw out former Formula One boss Max Mosley's claim for damages over 'sex orgy' pictures as a judge admitted awarding compensation would be 'difficult' Google has asked the High Court to throw out former Formula One boss Max Mosley's claim for damages over 'sex orgy' pictures as a judge admitted awarding compensation would be 'difficult'. Mosley, 74, is seeking damages from Google UK and parent company Google Inc, and an injunction banning the publication of the photographs on the search engine. He has brought a claim against US-based Google Inc and Google UK under the Data Protection Act and against Google Inc for misuse of private information. However, Google’s lawyers say that his case is unsustainable in fact and law and should be struck out. They also argue that permission to serve the claim on Google Inc outside the jurisdiction of the court should be set aside. The litigation follows Mosley’s 2008 privacy victory against the now-defunct News Of The World newspaper when he won £60,000 compensation after it accused him of taking part in a 'sick Nazi orgy' with five prostitutes. Mosley, the son of the 1930s Fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, did not dispute taking part in the sadomasochistic roleplay at a rented Chelsea basement flat, but said it was consensual and private, with no Nazi overtones. He said that his life had been devastated by the March 2008 expose and by the newspaper putting secretly-filmed footage on its website, which attracted at least 3.5 million hits. Today, Mosley continued his battle against Google in London’s High Court, but Mr Justice Mitting said damages ‘may simply not be available’ to him. However, the judge said some form of injunction banning the images could be ‘much less problematic’. Google’s counsel, Antony White QC, said today that the threshold test was whether a person had a reasonable expectation of privacy, taking into account all the circumstances of the case. Scroll down for video . 'There can be few privacy claims which relate to material which has been quite so widely publicised over so many years as the images which are the subject of this claim,' he told Mr Justice Mitting. He said that, shortly after the expose, Mr Justice Eady refused Mosley a temporary injunction against News Group Newspapers (NGN), saying that he no longer had any reasonable expectation of privacy and, even if he had, the 'dam has effectively burst' and an order would be futile. During the damages trial, Mr Justice Eady ruled that the newspaper article was not in the public interest. Mosley, 74, is seeking damages from Google UK (pictured) and parent company Google Inc, and an injunction banning the publication of the photographs on the search engine . He said Mosley 'had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to sexual activities (albeit unconventional) carried on between consenting adults on private property.' But he branded the former President of the motoring organisation the Federation Internationale de L’Automobile 'reckless and almost self destructive' and 'the author of his own misfortune.' After the trial, the judge did grant a permanent injunction against NGN, preventing re-publication, on the basis that it should not be entitled to profit from its own wrongdoing, but this did not prohibit other parties outside England and Wales from using images already in the public domain. 'The images, including the 95-second video, have now been continuously available online for over six years and have in all likelihood been viewed by millions of people around the world,' said Mr White. “There is no previous successful claim for misuse of private information which relates to material which has been so widely disseminated and which is so well-known. 'If the claimant had lost his reasonable expectation of privacy back in April 2008, within days of publication, it is clear that six years on he cannot have any reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the images.' Today, Mosley continued his battle against Google in London’s High Court, but Mr Justice Mitting said damages ‘may simply not be available’ to him . Mr White said that, notwithstanding this, Google Inc had used its notice and takedown procedures to block images when specific URLs had been provided because, whatever the strict legal position, it had some sympathy for Mosley and wished to avoid a dispute. He described Mosley, who was in court for the hearing, as someone who had remained in the public eye as 'an admirable campaigner for privacy rights'. Mosley has campaigned for privacy since the article was printed, backing pressure group Hacked Off and giving evidence in the Leveson Enquiry. He has also been successful in legal bids to stop Google from directing users to images of the orgy via the French and German courts. Mosley (pictured), who was in court for the hearing, was described as 'an admirable campaigner for privacy rights' by Google's lawyer Antony White . Mr White added that Google Inc, as the operator of Search, was not a 'publisher' of the images for the purposes of a privacy claim and no general obligation to monitor could be imposed on it. Mosley’s lawyers say that Google’s application is misconceived and want it dismissed with a defence filed within 28 days. His counsel, Hugh Tomlinson QC, said that although Mosley had pursued third parties who continued to publish in several jurisdictions, the image remained accessible to users of Google Search. Google accepted that links to the images should be removed from its indices, but would only do so after Mosley sent them the precise URL for each image, which meant he was forced to engage in what a Canadian court had described as an 'endless game of ""whack-a-mole""''. Mr Tomlinson added that this was despite the fact that, as Google now accepted, it was possible for it to take technical steps to prevent the images being indexed by Google Search in the first place. Faced with 'this lack of co-operation' from Google, Mosley had brought his claim in July last year. Mr Tomlinson added: 'Despite its dominance of the online search market in the UK, Google has consistently sought to avoid appearing before the English courts to defend itself on the merits. 'Whilst accepting that it should take material down - as in the present case - it has consistently refused to use automated technical means to assist individuals. 'The court should dismiss these applications and the defendants should be required to defend themselves at a full trial.' Mr Justice Mitting said he was not bound by Mr Justice Eady’s decision, since it was an interim order, adding he did not ‘see why, even if the fact is public, the photographs should not be subject to continuing restraint’. ‘If you accept as a premise that the possession alone of photographs of an intimate act is itself a breach of privacy and confidentiality, then it seems to me that you are entitled to restrain it, whether or not it is in the public domain,' he added. However, the judge indicated Mosley was unlikely to be able to win any sort of damages from Google. The judge said, ‘That particular remedy may simply not be available to the claimant’. Later he said that ‘the difficult part of Mr Tomlinson’s case is that [damages] part of his case’. But he said ordering some form of injunction appeared ‘much less problematic’. The lawyers mentioned the possibility of ‘fingerprinting’ pictures, which would identify them as being unfit for publication. Mr White conceded it was possible to mark certain pictures in this way and said it was not a difficult exercise for Google to undertake. Mr Justice Mitting appeared to favour this solution, saying it was ‘strongly arguable that there is a difference between something you can’t do anything about and something you can do something easily about’. On a separate issue, Mr White denied that Google was a ‘publisher’ of material, stating search results were created by ‘an algorithmic exercise without human knowledge or involvement’. Quoting an earlier judgement, he said Mosley’s case was ‘impermissibly speculative’. The hearing continues tomorrow when the judge is likely to reserve his decision to a later date.

"A 92-year-old RAF veteran was forced to wait for more than 26 hours in A&E waiting for a bed on a ward to become available as the winter crisis began to grip a district hospital. Cliff Curtis was rushed to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Wales after suffering chest pains on December 3. His daughter Jane Wade claims her father was forced to lie on a trolley in the corridor for three hours, before staff were able to move him to a cubicle in A&E. There the 92-year-old waited a further 23 hours, before a bed became available on a ward. Despite being seen within the four-hour waiting time, stipulated by the NHS constitution, Mr Curtis was forced to wait due to a bedding crisis - a familiar problem at hospitals across the UK. Before patients can be transferred from A&E to be admitted on to a ward, a bed has to become available. A 92-year-old RAF veteran was forced to wait more than 26 hours in A&E at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital before he could be admitted to a ward when a bed became available . In many cases patients, especially elderly people, cannot be discharged from hospital unless a suitable rehabilitation bed is available in community hospitals and care homes - a process organised by social services. Mrs Wade said the scenes in the Welsh A&E were 'chaotic' on the night her father was admitted. 'Where has it all gone wrong?,' she said. 'It's just very disappointing. 'It was just chaos in there - the waiting times were unbelievable. 'Myself, my sister and my daughter went with him to the hospital and we had to take it in turns to sit with him in the corridor. 'My father was frightened but he's not the type to complain about anything.' A GP called an ambulance for Mr Curtis, a great-grandfather who lived in sheltered accomodation in Rhondda Cynon Taff, on December 3 when his condition began to deteriorate. Ms Wade added: 'It took the ambulance 20 or 30 minutes to get to him. 'It was a non-emergency so we thought it came in around that amount of time - and the paramedics were marvellous. 'He was admitted to the hospital at about 3pm and stayed on the trolley until about 6pm when he was checked by doctors. 'He was then taken to a cubicle in A&E where we stayed with him for another three hours. 'We were told to go home at 9pm because they said they'd find him a bed as soon as they could. 'But they didn't put him on a ward until 5pm the following day. Cliff Curtis' daughter Jane Wade described the scenes in A&E as 'chaotic' adding that patients were facing 'unbelievable waiting times' As a nurse serving on the front line in Iraq she saw gunshot wounds, multiple trauma injuries, and children shot - the casualties of vicious warfare. Every day for six months she faced shelling, caring for soldiers on trolleys as warning sirens blared in the distance, alerting them to the enemy advancing. For most, the stressful, unpredictable and highly pressurised conditions, are an alien concept. But for nurses, doctors, healthcare assistants and support staff on the front line of Britain's NHS, life at work is 'worse than conditions in a warzone'. A senior nurse at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, pictured, has written a brutal account of the pressures of working in A&E, claiming conditions are 'worse' than serving on the front line in the Iraq war . The senior nurse claims life staffing the busiest A&E ward in Wales is worse than anything she faced in a field hospital during the second Iraq war. Her brutal three-page account comes after a stressful night in the department, and just a week after the latest figures revealed waiting times at A&Es in England reached their lowest point since 2004. The NHS England figures revealed just 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target set in 2004. In Wales, where the NHS is run by Labour, figures for November were even worse, with just 83.8 per cent of patients being seen within four hours. The letter was read out at a meeting for staff with the managers at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, and pinned to a staff noticeboard. In it, the nurse recalls the heartbreaking moment a pregnant mother miscarried on the floor after waiting to be seen for two hours, a suicidal patient locked herself in the toilets and a woman suffered a suspected heart attack in the waiting room. 'It was a very distressing time for the family.' Mr Curtis suffered a heart attack during his stay at the Royal Glamorgan, and spent both his birthday and Christmas Day on the ward. He passed away on the morning on New Year's Eve, of suspected pneumonia. His daughter added: 'What upsets me more than anything is that he should have been treated with more respect at his age. 'My father has worked all his life. 'The corridor was cold and we had to find a blanket to put over him.' A spokesman for Cwm Taf University Health Board said it did not comment on individual cases. Amanda Cassidy, head of nursing at Royal Glamorgan Hospital, said: 'We apologise to anyone who is experiencing long waits in our A&E departments. 'As with all hospitals during the winter months we are dealing with increased pressures in our emergency departments with many more patients requiring admission. 'This may result in some patients being cared for in our medical assessment area with a dedicated nurse while waiting for a bed on a ward to become available. 'Providing the highest quality patient care is our utmost priority and our staff are working tirelessly to keep waits to a minimum wherever possible.'","Cliff Curtis was rushed to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on December 3 .

"A benefits cheat who falsely received more than £20,000 in payments after he claimed he could barely walk was caught on CCTV while heading to work 10-hour days as a butcher. Carl Pearce first claimed incapacity allowance in February 2003, stating that he was 'unable or virtually unable to walk'. But he failed to notify the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) when he started working at a butchers in 2006 - and swindled thousands of pounds in benefits over the next seven years. Scroll down for video . Caught: Carl Pearce was filmed arriving at the butchers where he works on two separate occasions (left and right). He was seen moving with ease despite claiming on a self-assessment form that he could hardly walk . False claims: Pearce, pictured on CCTV, continued to receive benefits for more than seven years after he started working at the butchers in 2003. He was given a six-month suspended jail sentence today . Investigators for the DWP received a tip off that Pearce, from Sedgley, West Midlands, was working at Melvin's Butchers at Cannock, Staffordshire. The 55-year-old was filmed on security cameras as he arrived at work on two occasions. The footage shows him walking down the incline to the shop without any apparent difficulty. Pearce was given a six-month jail sentence suspended for two years after admitting to illegally receiving a total of £20,178 by failing to notify a change in circumstance. Duncan Craig, prosecuting at Wolverhampton Crown Court, said: 'He stated that he was unable or virtually unable to walk but his circumstances changed in January 2006 when he commenced employment at the butcher's shop. 'It was discovered that he had been working there five days a week, ten hours a day, since January 2006.' Miss Alisha Harris, defending, claimed Pearce suffered from a 'catalogue' of different complaints but had been able to 'manage' the pain through medication. Health problems: Miss Alisha Harris, defending, claimed Pearce, pictured in the CCTV footage, suffered from a 'catalogue' of different complaints but had been able to 'manage' the pain through medication . Repayment: As well as his suspended sentence, Pearce, pictured left and right as he walked to work in 2013, was ordered to do 60 hours of unpaid work. He has begun to repay the money claimed . Miss Harris said: 'When he first made the claim for benefits he was told that it would not need renewing. He did not know he had to update his circumstances. 'He suffers from arthritis, high blood pressure and depression.' The court heard Pearce was still working at the butcher's shop. As well as his suspended sentence, Pearce was ordered to do 60 hours of unpaid work. He has begun to repay the money claimed. Recorder Anthony Lowe said: 'Whenever people read of fraud involving the state benefits system they get increasingly impatient of people like me. 'They think we should always send the likes of you to prison and they may have a point. 'But there are features of this case that make it slightly different. 'Undoubtedly you were entitled to benefit at the outset and nobody took the view that your condition required regular medical reviews. 'You may have been led into the belief that you were entitled to continue.' Sian Fellowes, DWP Fraud Manager said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system. 'Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of. 'It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net. 'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime. 'Don't wait for our fraud investigators to find you.

"It's the stuff of nightmares. A man frantically bounds from roof-to-roof, running from a pack of blood-thirsty zombies. Thankfully, this is not the apocalypse, but a white-knuckle point-of-view video, featuring a Parkour athlete dramatically scaling walls and leaping between buildings. Inspired by the highly-anticipated action survival game, Dying Light, the video is shot from the point-of-view of a Parkour athlete, charting his frantic escape from zombies, over the rooftops of Cambridge. Its director, Scott Bass, 23,  told MailOnline: 'I wanted to have something that took the viewer on a whirlwind parkour experience, but finish in a way that felt true to the tone of the game. The video is shot from the point-of-view of a parkour runner, charting his frantic escape from zombies . No injuries occured while filming the Parkour scences - but there was an incident when one cast member was eating while walking down the stairs . 'I’ve been involved in Parkour since 2005, and pursuing it professionally since 2010. I usually work as a director for films involving parkour, but also as photographer and consultant from time to time.' The dramatic video was shot over three days in the director's home town. Bass explained: 'Collectively, I felt we all knew Cambridge best for this film. Its the closest looking city to the game I could think of, and I had a lot of confidence in scouting out locations that I knew we could work with.' 'We had to battle the weather and light a bit, as we shot last november. We had quite a lot of rain during the shoot, and you can see plenty of puddles in the film because of this.' Well-known Parkour athlete Toby Segar stars as the hero, who is chased through the streets of Cambridge . Frantic chase: The video's director, Scott Bass, has been involved in Parkour since 2005 . Hands off: In a dramatic moment, one of the video's blood-thirsty zombies grabs the hero's crotch . 'We had Toby Segar as the hero zombie, and Alex Potts, Phil Doyle and Neil Cointet rounded out my zombie cast. They’re all very talented and well known Parkour athletes, so I had a bit of an all-star crew really.' 'I think my favourite moment is around 2:15, where the zombie jumps at the hero and grabs at his… crotch. It was planned the zombie would grab at the hero, but it just happened to be that he grabbed there. 'I actually liked the authenticity of the take and knew it would be something that viewers would want to comment on, so I left it in. 'We had one small injury where one of the guys was eating while walking down stairs during a location move, but nothing from parkour!

"An Adelaide petrol station baron has told a jury he was bullied and assaulted by a police officer when he was pulled over while driving a $500,000 Rolls Royce. Yasser Shahin, 38, told a jury in South Australia's District Court he was pulled over because the tinted windows on his luxury car were too dark. The businessman said he felt pain and discomfort when Senior Constable Norman Hoy grabbed his right shoulder and threw him back after stopping him in Grenfell Street in Adelaide's CBD on September 18, 2010. Scroll down for video . Ms Shahin was pulled over by Senior Constable Hoy on September 18, 2010 in Adelaide's CBD . Senior Constable Norman Hoy is accused of assaulting petrol station baron Yasser Shahin . The Rolls Royce was only 18 months old at the time of the incident but the window tinting was too dark, 9News reported. Hoy, 59, has pleaded not guilty to the aggravated assault of Mr Shahin, whose family owns Peregrine Corporation, Shahin Enterprises, BP On the Run, Smokemart and Adelaide's Krispy Kreme. Giving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Shahin said his wife, mother and baby son were in the car at the time. He said when he asked why he was pulled over, Hoy replied: 'You don't get to dictate why or when I get to pull you over'. 'I suggested it was a smartarse I was dealing with and the situation escalated, with the officer asking a number of questions followed by demanding possession of the car, asking for the keys,' Mr Shahin said. Mr Shahin said he opened the door very slightly and leaned in to get the keys from the ignition when he was grabbed by Hoy, who later pushed him in the chest. Mr Shahin's family owns Peregrine Corporation, Shahin Enterprises, BP On the Run, Smokemart and Adelaide's Krispy Kreme . Prosecutor Nicholas Healy told the jury Hoy was wearing a personal recording device which captured most of the incident, including a threat Mr Shahin would be 'in all sorts of strife' if he re-entered his Rolls. Mr Healy suggested the constable exceeded his powers in using force on the businessman. Under cross-examination from defence lawyer Marie Shaw, QC, Mr Shahin said he felt he had been bullied when he was 'consistently shouted at' by Hoy and his junior colleague. Ms Shaw asked if he did not heed an instruction to move off the road, telling the colleague: 'You are not a lawyer, I know heaps more about the law than you, so don't tell me where to stand'. Mr Shahin denied a suggestion he stood close to the policeman's face, but agreed he said something along the lines of being a lawyer and not needing to move off the road. 'I had already experienced a number of inappropriate, perhaps even illegal, instructions and I wanted them to know I knew my rights,' he said. The trial is continuing.

"The Green Party now has overtaken UKIP to become Britain’s fourth biggest party, new figures revealed today. Some 2,000 activists joined the party overnight, taking its membership to 43,829 – almost 2,000 more than UKIP and just 700 shy of the Liberal Democrats. The revelation will renew calls for Green Party leader Natalie Bennett to be included in TV election debates ahead of the May 7 poll. It comes as Ed Miliband used a speech on climate change this morning to shore up Labour's vote ahead of the election, amid growing fears  that the Greens are syphoning off its traditional supporters. Membership of the Greens will overtake Ukip within a week and could even pull ahead of the Liberal Democrats by the time of the general election . Mr Miliband told activists in north London that the green agenda and a desire to reduce inequality were ‘at the heart of my beliefs’. In a thinly-veiled swipe at Mr Cameron, the Labour leader said that fighting climate change was not ‘part of a branding exercise’ but were the reason he entered politics. He said ‘tackling climate change is the most important thing I can do in politics for my children's generation’. Mr Miliband, however, has insisted the proposed TV election debates should go ahead without the Greens after the media regulator Ofcom ruled they were not a 'major' party. But David Cameron has insisted he will not take part in the head-to-head debates unless the Greens are invited. Natalie Bennett, Green Party in England and Wales leader, said any debate would be ‘unrepresentative’ if the Greens were not included and that the party was talking to lawyers about possible legal action. Mr Miliband told activists the green agenda and a desire to reduce inequality were ‘at the heart of my beliefs’ In a thinly-veiled swipe at Mr Cameron, the Labour leader said that fighting climate change was not ‘part of a branding exercise’ but were the reason he entered politics . Labour is still the largest party in terms of number of members – with an estimated 190,000 activists. The Conservatives are the second biggest party – with 149,800 members. But, following a surge in members following the independence referendum, the third biggest party is now the SNP with 92,000 followers. The party is expected to have more than 100,000 registered supporters by the May election – ten times more than its membership in 2003. It comes as a new poll shows the Green party is neck-and-neck with the Conservatives among voters aged 18-24. A new poll shows the Green party is neck-and-neck with the Conservatives among voters aged 18-24 . David Cameron (left),  Nick Clegg (centre) and the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown clashed in the final leaders' election debate, hosted by  the BBC in  Birmingham just a week before the general election in 2010 . Both parties were on 22 per cent in December, behind Labour on 32 per cent. The Lib Dems, who traditionally banked on a high level of support from young voters, have plummeted to 5 per cent, with Ukip on 13 per cent. The figures are likely to be jumped on by Mr Cameron, who is refusing to take part in televised leaders’ debates unless the Greens are included. Mr Cameron has been accused of making ‘pathetic excuses’ to dodge a TV showdown with Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip. Nigel Farage's Ukip face being eclipsed in membership figures by the Greens . But the Prime Minister reiterated that the Greens must be involved in the sessions if Ukip are - and suggested the Liberal Democrats should have their role downgraded because they are only a ‘minor’ party. But in bruising clashes in the Commons, Ed Miliband deployed Margaret Thatcher's famous barb by branding Mr Cameron ‘frit’. The Labour leader pointed out that in 2010 Mr Cameron had condemned ‘feeble’ reasons for backing out of debates, and said ‘no-one believed’ his protests were genuine now. ‘It is frankly a pathetic excuse. It is not for him, it is not for me, it is not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate. It is up to the broadcasters, that is the country we live in,’ Mr Miliband said. ‘Is he really telling the people of Britain that he is going to seek to deny them the TV debate if he doesn't get to choose who is in them?’ Mr Cameron hit back that Mr Miliband was ‘chicken’ for being unwilling to face off against Green Party leader Natalie Bennett as well as Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Ukip's Nigel Farage. ‘I'm all for these debates but you cannot have two minor parties without the third minor party. Why is he frightened of debating the Green Party?’ The Tory leader indicated that he believed there should be two debates, rather than the three currently floated by the broadcasters. ‘There are two credible sets of debates. You can either have a debate with all the national parties who appear in this House,’ he said. ‘Or you can have a debate ... between the two people who would become Prime Minister. Those are the credible debates.’","Greens membership is now 43,829 - almost 2,000 ahead of Ukip .

"It’s been 26 years since we saw them magically tightening Marty McFly’s Nike boots in Back to The Future. Now, self-tying shoelaces could actually become a reality this year, proving right one of the film’s fantastical predictions for what 2015 would be like. Engineers have designed a shoe that can automatically lace up, adjusting itself to the shape of your foot. Scroll down for video . The German scientists attached an energy harvester attached to the shoe during trial runs to see how recharging will work with different body types . The University of Freiburg self-tying shoe prototype recalls the famous Nike High Tops in Back to the Future. The shoe company is releasing a version of the trainers (pictured in 2015 . Simply slip the trainer on and pressure sensors will tell the ‘smart shoe’ when your foot is in position, triggering a tiny motor in the heel that pulls the laces tight. When you want to take off the shoes, you click your heels together twice and the motor will release a spring in the shoe’s tongue, which loosens the laces enough for you to slip them off. And the ingenious invention doesn’t even need to be plugged in to charge or have its battery replaced because it runs on power generated by the swing of your foot as you walk. Engineer Klevis Ylli, of the Institute for Micromachining and Information Technology in southern Germany, said the shoes could help a variety of different people. ‘One focus is that it could be used in shoes for elderly people who have mobility problems,’ he said. ‘But it could also work for children, or as a lifestyle product.’ The design, which is still in a prototype phase, cleverly captures the energy of the foot’s swing when opposing magnets in each shoe move past each other. It then uses that power to charge a battery. An hour of walking is enough to tighten the laces once, and it requires no energy to undo the shoes because that relies on the spring alone. The shoes’ power can also be topped up by placing them on a wireless charging mat. Mr Ylli and a team from the University of Freiburg, who detail their design in the journal Smart Materials And Structures today, are also developing a gadget that could be put in shoes to make them act as a navigation system.

"A have-a-go-hero father was smashed over the head with a mallet by a gang of teenagers when he tried to stop them burgling his neighbour's house. Andrew Bishop, 56, heard a commotion in his street in Sidcup, south east London, and went to investigate when he was attacked by the five youths, said to be speaking in Irish accents. He suffered a deep gash to his head but still managed to wrestle a broom handle from one of the boys and they fled the scene in a red or orange Ford Focus ST. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Have-a-go hero, Andrew Bishop, heard a commotion at a neighbour's house in Sidcup, south east London, and went to investigate when he was attacked by a gang of youths, who hit him with a mallet . Photographs of his horrific injuries were posted on social media by his 18-year-old daughter as a warning to other residents. Marnie Bishop said: 'My dad is my hero, he wrestled the burglars and got smacked over the head. 'Hate seeing someone I love so much hurt. Hopefully the little scumbags get caught.' This horrific image shows the deep gash suffered by Mr Bishop after he attempted to stop burglars . Following the incident at around 6.45pm on January 6, Mr Bishop was taken to a south London hospital where he received treatment for the head injury, which was not life-threatening. The suspects are all described as white men, believed to be in their late teens or early 20s, and it is not known whether anything was taken from the house, thought to be worth around £300,000. They are understood to be targeting homes in the Sidcup and Blackfen areas and knocking on doors, then asking for directions to see if people are in and as a distraction to see where keys are. A police spokesman said: 'Detectives in Bexley are appealing for information and witnesses after a man was assaulted after challenging burglars at his neighbour's house. 'Police were called to reports of a man being assaulted in Sidcup at 6:45pm on Tuesday. 'Officers attended the scene and found a 56-year-old man suffering from a head injury.' Anyone with any information should call Bexley police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

"As well as visiting the Jurassic Coast and having a photograph next to the cliff which started the first series off, die-hard Broachchurch fans can now go one better. DI Alec Hardy's, played by David Tennant, home in the hit ITV drama is up for sale. The tiny wooden blue hut on the banks of the River Brit in West Bay, Dorset, has gone on the market for £275,000 as the so-called 'Broachchurch effect' kicks in. The blue chalet made famous by David Tennant's character in Broadchurch has gone on the market for £275k . David Tennant broods: Series producers reportedly hired the chalet for two separate periods of two weeks . Previously let as a holiday chalet for as little as £41 per night, the 100 year old two-bed waterfront property has recently been swamped with interest since Broadchurch first aired in 2013. It's one of four homes built around 1900 next to the River Brit, can only be reached by foot and has the unique position of looking out across the harbour, river and meadows behind. Series producers reportedly hired the chalet for two separate periods of two weeks while filming the ITV drama, home to David Tennant's brooding lead character. The hut sits on the bank of the River Brit in  Dorset and has been rent out as a holiday let for two years . The owner Abbey Evans (above) has listed the property with estate agents Lyme Coast Holidays . When asked about the proposed uplift in price thanks to the show Malcolm Gill, of estate agents Lyme Coast Holidays, said, 'It's impossible to quantify but I would say it has probably benefitted from an uplift of between £25,000 and £50,000.' 'We have tried to price it fairly and sensibly without being greedy and I think the owner will be pleasantly surprised to achieve the asking price.' He may be right to be optimistic as hotel searches to West Bay, Dorset, have  seen an increase of 50 per cent, according to research conducted by hotel.com, and house prices in the picturesque areas have risen by the same amount. Britbank is described on Lyme Coast Holiday's website as a 'very unusual Edwardian seaside home' Previously let as a holiday chalet for £41 a week, the 100 year old  property has  been swamped with interest . The blue hut called Britbank is described on Lyme Coast Holiday's website as a 'very unusual Edwardian seaside home right on the riverbank of the river Brit and only a few yards from the sandy beach and the iconic hamstone cliff which also featured in the series on location in West Bay'. It says that while the chalet has successfully been a holiday let for the past two years the artist and sculptor owner, Abbey Evans, has decided to put it up for sale. The tiny property was spotted by Chris Chibnall, the creator of Broadchurch, who lives in nearby Bridport . David Tennant and Olivia Colman in character: Chibnall has said chalet 'holds lots – if not all – of the secrets' The property was spotted by Chris Chibnall, the creator of Broadchurch, who lives in nearby Bridport, when he was writing the first series in a local café. At the time, Tenant's character was still being developed and it is thought that much of the second series was then created around the idea of the Jurassic Coast chalet as Tenant's base. Chibnall has said the chalet 'holds lots – if not all – of the secrets'. Mr Evans, 60, bought the chalet in 2000 and said it held wonderful memories for both him and his son. 'I am sad to let it go and if my circumstances were different, I would try and keep it on,' he told the Telegraph. 'I had a lot of good times there with my son. His surfboard is still in the roof with lots of old fishing rods.' 'I just hope the horrible murder won't put people off,' he joked. As a warning to would-be Broadchurch tourists the estate agents note that they are happy to 'arrange a viewing for those that are genuinely interested in acquiring Britbank'.","DI Alec Hardy's iconic wooden blue chalet in hit ITV drama is up for sale .

"These astonishing pictures show how Chetham Library in Manchester, where Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels famously began their work on the Communist Manifesto, has remained largely unchanged since they first sat down together in 1845. It's been a closed book, but these pictures reveal how time has stood still in the of the world’s oldest and most unique libraries. These astonishing pictures show how Chetham Library in Manchester has remained largely unchanged in hundreds of years . Chetham's Library in the heart of Manchester city centre was founded in 1653 and is the oldest public library in the English-speaking world . The library boasts more than 100,000 volumes of printed books (some pictured) of which 60,000 were published before 1851 . The library is completely free to visit and is one of the city's hidden gems, boasting most of its original features - like these exposed beams . But you could walk past Chetham’s library, in the heart of Manchester city centre, in the blink of an eye and be none the wiser about the incredible treasures tucked away inside. Amid the hustle and bustle near the National Football Museum and Manchester Cathedral, the 17th Century library is tucked away from view, snuggled next to the famous Chetham’s School of Music. But it is completely free to visit and is arguably one of the city’s, if not the country’s, greatest hidden gems. Radical German Marx met up with his fellow German, the industrialist Friedrich Engels, to formulate their political ideas and the desk where the pair worked in 1845 remains on display. Located in the busy area near the National Football Museum and Manchester Cathedral, the 17th Century library is tucked away from view . But the library is not stuck in Medieval times - its collections encompass everything from a substantial archive about Belle Vue Zoo . Among the more bizarre items are the belongings of John Dee, an occultist and former warden of the college who believed in angel summoning . When it was first founded the building which houses the library was the second largest building in the medieval town of Manchester . The entire collection at Chetham's Library has been designated as one of national and international importance and has many rare books . Founded in 1653 following the death of Humphrey Chetham, the site is Britain’s oldest public reference library. Its dark wooden shelves and atmospheric wooden beams bear more than a passing resemblance to Hogwarts and contain a trove of treasures, ranging from a rare first version of John Milton’s epic poem Paradise Lost to the death mask of clergyman Thomas Whitaker. Among the most bizarre items are personal belongings of self-proclaimed magician John Dee, an occultist and former warden of Manchester College who believed in angel summoning and perpetual motion. But the library is not stuck in Medieval times - and its collections encompass everything from a substantial archive about Belle Vue Zoo to one of the world’s foremost collections of Northern Soul paraphernalia. As well as boasting original features, it has a number of treasures including a rare first version of John Milton’s epic poem Paradise Lost . The library began acquiring books in  1655 and has been adding to it ever since - it even boasts a collection of Northern Soul paraphernalia . As well as early printed books, the collections include a wealth of manuscript diaries, letters, deeds, prints, paintings and glass lantern slides . The library was established under the will of Humphrey Chetham, a prosperous Manchester textile merchant, banker and landowner . The building that houses Chetham's is even older than the foundation of the Library - it was built in 1421 to accommodate a college of priests . The building which still boasts many original features remains one of the most complete medieval complexes to survive in the north west . When it was founded the library acquired a major collection of books and manuscripts so it would rival the libraries of Oxford and Cambridge . Today the library continues to expand its collection and now specialises in the history and topography of Greater Manchester and Lancashire . Chetham's has been in continuous use as a free public library for over 350 years and is also a  popular tourist destination in the city . The beautiful old sandstone buildings, together with the magnificent Library interior, create a unique atmosphere for readers and visitors alike . The library is run as an independent charity and remains open to readers and visitors completely free of charge to this day .","Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels famously began work on the Communist Manifesto in Chetham Library, Manchester .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has abandoned a plan to cut the $20 Medicare rebate for short consultations. Health Minister Sussan Ley  announced the back-down on Thursday after the government faced immense pressure from doctors and opposition MPs. Ms Ley said she was deeply concerned by misinformation causing confusion for patients and confusion for doctors about the changes. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has abandoned a plan to cut the $20 Medicare rebate for short consultations . Health Minister Sussan Ley on Thursday announced the back-down on Thursday after the government faced immense pressure from doctors and opposition MPs . 'As a result, I'm announcing today that the changes to level A and B Medicare consultation items will not commence on Monday as planned,' she told reporters in Melbourne. 'The government is taking them off the table.' 'I have heard, I have listened and I have decided to take this action now,' the minister said, after breaking her holiday to address the issue. However, she insisted it remained critical that there should be reform to ensure the Medicare system has a sustainable future to give quality care. The minister made a strong commitment to undertake a wide ranging consultation on the ground with doctors and the community to come up with sensible options. 'I need to explain ... that our Medicare system is growing at a rapid and unsustainable rate.' The changes, introduced by the Abbott government to cut costs, would have seen Medicare pay $20.10 less for consultations under 10 minutes from January 19 . Earlier, Australian Medical Association president Brian Owler wrote to Mr Abbott urging him to intervene to overturn the plan to cut by $20.10 the rebate paid to GPs for consultations under 10 minutes. Doctors said the measure would lead to increased out-of-pocket expenses for patients and ultimately to higher national health costs. Labor, the Greens and four crossbenchers also vowed to team up to refuse the regulation after the Senate returns on February 9. 'It was never a good idea, and Mr Abbott should take this opportunity to ditch it and instead consult with the medical profession on how to support quality primary healthcare,' Associate Professor Owler said on Thursday. Doctors said the measure would lead to increased out-of-pocket expenses for patients and ultimately to higher national health costs . Earlier in the day, Small Business Minister Bruce Billson said the government would push on with the important reform to discourage doctors from practising so-called six-minute medicine. 'We'll continue to make the case that this reform is necessary. It is thoughtful, it is prudent. This change is on the table. It is being implemented,' Mr Billson told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday. 'It is an important measure and there are no alternatives being advocated by anybody.' His comments followed a statement on Wednesday from Ms Ley, who accused Labor of playing politics with the issue. 'Without reform, Medicare will collapse under its own weight and jeopardise the world-class, affordable healthcare Australians take for granted,' her statement said. Labor, the Greens and four crossbenchers also vowed to team up to refuse the regulation after the Senate returns on February 9 . Medicare has paid $37.05 towards short visits for years, and the plan was to cut that amount to $16.95. Critics said the change would prompt doctors to stop bulk billing these shorter consultations and start charging patients to cover costs. The Abbott government also scrapped its plan for a $7 Medicare co-payment before Christmas. Instead, an optional co-payment would be introduced at the same time the Medicare rebate to GPs is reduced by $5. It will be up to doctors to decide whether their patients make up the difference or bulk bill them. Incentives to bulk bill children under 16, concession card holders, pensioners and veterans will remain in place. The new measures will come into place from July.","Government abandons plan to cut $20  rebate for short consultations .

"Sarah Palin, the anti-word-mincing human megaphone who was once a vice presidential candidate and the GOP's best hope for a new female vanguard, said Wednesday that she doesn't 'give a flying flip' if a woman wins the White House. The change of heart comes as Democrat Hillary Clinton is poised to break a glass ceiling and become America's first 'Madame President' after serving as first lady, a U.S. senator, secretary of state and the GOP's favorite punching bag. 'I don't give a flying flip about what gender the person will be,' Palin told Norville, who asked her if electing a female president was important. 'I want the absolute best because America deserves the best, in terms of leadership, getting this country on the right track.' Sarah Palin said she doesn't 'give a flying flip' if a woman becomes president but admits it would be nice. SEEMS SO LONG AGO: Palin was Sen. John McCain's vice presidential running mate in 2008 and lost to President Barack Obama and VP Joe Biden . 'But yeah, it would be nice,' she finally admitted, 'and it will be nice to see women jump into the ring.' The interview aired the same day the Pew Research Center published a survey of more than 1.800 American adults, asking questions about the leadership roles of women in modern society. Pew found that 73 per cent of them expect to see a female president in their lifetimes – but only 38 per cent say they hope it happens. Another 57 per cent say it doesn't matter to them either way. There's also a strong split on the issue along party lines. 'Democratic women in particular are strong proponents of female political leaders,' Pew reported. 'In most cases, they are more likely than both Democratic men and Republican women to say that female political leaders do a better job [than] men.' 'Among Democratic women, fully 69 per cent say they hope the U.S. will elect a female president in their lifetime,' the survey's writers said. 'This compares with 46 per cent of Democratic men, 20 per cent of Republican women and 16 per cent of Republican men.' But for many Republicans, Pew adds, 'this view may be more about the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency than about a major milestone for women.' HEIRESS-APPARENT: Most political wags think the Democratic presidential nomination is Hillary Clinton's to claim . FLAME-OUT: Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann made a splash in the 2012 Republican presidential field but went nowhere after her chronic, debilitating migraines became the stuff of front pages . NO APOLOGIES: Comedienne Roseann Barr ran for president in 2012 on the Green Party ticket but came up short, taking second place in convention delegates . Palin was more enthusiastic a month ago about seeing Y-chromosomes frozen out of America's ultimate political prize in 2016. 'I would love to see a woman on both sides of the aisle shooting for that top spot,' she told Extra TV in early December – when asked specifically about Clinton’s likely candidacy. She has also trotted out her 'flying flip' euphemism before. In November 2013 at the height of the Obamacare website crisis, she told Newsmax TV that the project's online woes were the least of her concerns. 'I don't give a flying flip about a malfunctioning website,' Palin snarked. 'A broken website is the least of our worries. The greater worry is what Obamacare is all about.' The U.S. has a storied history of women running for president and vice president, although most Americans' knowledge of the history doesn't stretch back further than the modern era. In addition to Palin's VP run in 2008 as Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain's running mate, Democrat Geraldine Ferraro took an equally futile shot at the VP race in 1984 with Walter Mondale in the top slot. 1984: George Orwell's favorite year brought us Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro, who lost as Walter Mondale's vice presidential running mate . TRAILBLAZERS: In 1872 Victoria Woodhull (left) ran for president under the Equal Rights Party banner; the legendary abolitionist Frederick Douglass was her vice presidential running mate . In 2012 two women ran for president – Minnesota's then-congresswoman Michele Bachmann and famed TV loudmouth comic Roseann Barr, who came in second among delegates for the Green Party nomination. That prize went to another woman, physician Jill Stein. Overall more than 80 women have been candidates for the U.S. presidency, and another 60 have sought the second-banana job. The first came in 1872 when Victoria Woodhull ran for president under the Equal Rights Party banner. The legendary abolitionist Frederick Douglass was her running mate. The two failed to win electoral votes from any states, but they laid important groundwork both for women and for African-Americans – Douglass was an escaped black slave before winning fame as an orator, social reformer and statesman. Ferraro and Palin, though, share the distinction of becoming their parties' official nominees for the vice presidency, a feat no other woman has matched. And no female has led the Democrats or the Republicans into a presidential election at the top of the ticket.","Palin appeared Wednesday night on Inside Edition with host Deborah Norville .

"Robbie Williams has become embroiled in a planning dispute with his  Led Zeppelin legend neighbour Jimmy Page. The former Take That star wants to do up his £17million mansion in Holland Park, west London by installing a lift and a recording studio. But his plans have not gone down well with neighbour Jimmy Page, who has objected to the changes in a strongly-worded letter to Kensington and Chelsea Council. Scroll down for video . Robbie Williams wants to make a number of alterations to his £17.5million mansion (left) in Holland Park, west London - but Jimmy Page who lives in a turreted home nearby (right) objects to the changes . Page (right) - the guitarist for Led Zeppelin - fears the building work may impact on his own property . Williams, 40, bought the 46-room mansion from late film director Michael Winner in 2013. He now wants to carry out a number of interior alterations to turn the Victorian mansion into a contemporary family home. The plans - which also include the installation of a lift and a recording studio - have been poorly received by Page, who lives in the Grade I listed Tower House nearby. The musician - whose band's hits included Whole Lotta Love - has owned the landmark home for more than 40 years and regards it as one of the most important properties in the borough. In a strongly-worded letter to the council, Page has expressed a number of concerns. He wrote: 'I have been responsible for the protection of the Tower House for over 40 years and I am always concerned when proposals are made for nearby properties which may be detrimental to the well-being of this important heritage asset.' Page says because Williams' house is Grade II listed, the exterior should be considered 'sacrosanct'. The famous pair have lived next door to each other for more than a year but have fallen out over the plans . Williams bought the house - which is the former home of Michael Winner - with his wife Ayda Field in 2013 . Page - pictured (left) recently with his girlfriend Scarlett Sabet, 25, and (right) in Led Zeppelin's 1970s heyday - says Williams' home is Grade II listed and its exterior should be treated as 'sacrosanct' He says a new window planned will overlook the side of his house and his back garden, which will have a 'significant impact on the amenity' of his property. The rockstar is also concerned that work on the underground swimming pool could cause 'vibrations and possible structural' damage to Tower House. Page, aged 71, also objects to Williams knocking down part of his home's boundary wall to allow access to a planned garden car park. He wrote: '[This] will be detrimental to the general amenity of the conservation area as well as destroying part of the attractive boundary wall.' Williams' planning application states the building work will take place from early this month until October this year, with workmen accessing the site between 8am and 6pm on Mondays to Fridays and 8am and 1pm on Saturdays. He promises no work will be carried out on Sundays or Bank Holidays and reversing vehicles will be guided in by 'suitably qualified banksman'. The house's main bedroom, pictured during the time the late Michael Winner lived at the property . Williams bought the house in 2013, after the director's death, and is now keen to renovate the property . The west London mansion, pictured in 2011 when Winner tried to sell it, includes a swimming pool room . Page bought Tower House in 1972. The 19th century, Grade I listed home was built by William Burgess and, in the 1960s, was saved from demolition after a campaign led by John Betjeman and Evelyn Waugh. Williams' house also has a colourful history. The property was bought by George Winner for £2,000 in 1946. It was the home Michael Winner grew up in. The Death Wish director took the property over in 1978, transforming it from three flats into his own personal palace. Winner put the mansion on the market for £60 million in 2011, but he couldn't find a buyer. The director passed away in January 2013, with Williams buying the home later that year for £17.5 million. He submitted the plans to Kensington and Chelsea Council in December with the public consultation ending on January 2. A decision on the plans is expected by the end of the month. Both parties declined to comment. Plans on the local council's website show the extent to which Williams plans to re-tile his home's roof . They also show how he wants to demolish parts of inside walls and build a new window (top left of plan) The designs show the window (bottom left of plan) that Page has complained about to council officials .","Former Take That singer bought Holland Park mansion in 2013 .

"After months of rumours, Facebook has officially launched its Facebook at Work pilot. Designed to be used as self-contained social network within companies, the site has begun rolling out apps to a select number of 'partner' firms. Facebook at Work is available on the web, Android and iOS and the Californian tech giant described it as 'a separate experience that gives employees the ability to connect and collaborate efficiently using Facebook tools.' Scroll down for video . Facebook at Work is currently a pilot and is only available on the web, Android and iOS to a select number of 'partner' firms. The Californian tech giant described it as 'a separate experience that gives employees the ability to connect and collaborate efficiently using Facebook tools' Reports claim that the site features a News Feed, Groups, Messages and Events, like the original social network. Privacy wise, Facebook at Work will only be accessible by people within a company. And the tech giant said an employee’s Facebook at Work information is 'safe, secure, confidential and completely separate from their personal profile.' Facebook confirmed yesterday that it will start placing clickable warnings over extreme 'graphic' content on its site. The warnings, which are placed over flagged images and videos, state that the content might 'shock offend and upset'. The move comes after the Californian social media site came under fire for failing to impose greater controls on disturbing images. The warning asks the user 'are you sure you want to see this?'. Content with the warning will not be seen by users under 18 and videos will also not autoplay like other newsfeed items. Videos to come under the new measures include footage of the death of French policeman, Ahmed Merabet, who was shot in Paris during the Charlie Hebdo attacks. When the rumours first originated in November, sources said the site would likely launch without adverts. However, this may mean Facebook charges companies to use the app as an alternative way to make money. By launching an enterprise version of the site, Facebook is also taking aim at LinkedIn, as well as Microsoft's Yammer. Facebook staff were said to have been given a beta version of the ad-free Facebook at Work to test in December. A study last year found that more than 54 per cent of offices currently block Facebook on work computers to stop it distracting users. In October, Facebook  reported its quarterly profit nearly doubled to £511 million ($802 million), but saw its stock hit hard after outlining a plan to invest heavily in the future instead of using its short-term riches. 'We are going to continue preparing for the future by investing aggressively, connecting everyone, understanding the world, and building the next-generation in computing platforms,' said boss Mark Zuckerberg at the time. 'We have a long journey ahead.' The 10-year-old site currently has 1.35 billion monthly active users worldwide, while LinkedIn has more than 332 million members in more than 200 countries and territories.

By launching an enterprise version of the site, Facebook is taking aim at professional network LinkedIn . According to the professional site, users sign up to join LinkedIn at a rate of more than two new members per second. The site lets professionals 'connect' with each other to form networks. It also has its own messaging service and news feed. But Nicholas Scholz, global product manager, collaboration, at software firm Novell isn't convinced: 'We already know enough about Facebook that we can start making conclusions as to where this will end.

It is also testing a feature that lets users of the leading social network make purchases by simply pressing an on-screen 'Buy' button. Meanwhile, Facebook completed its multibillion-dollar deal for mobile messaging application WhatsApp last year. And in November, it revamped its privacy policy to make it easier to understand, after years of criticism. It has also introduced tools to help people manage what they share on the site. The site's security was heightened at the end of last year when it rolled out default encryption, too. 'This is the same site where members share everything and anything with Friends. 'People of all ages leave privacy at the door when they sign-in to Facebook. 'You can essentially equate Facebook to the party guy you want to hang out with on Friday night who's funny, popular and a bit crazy - but would you want to work with him? 'It seems Facebook is not just looking to build another social network to compete with the likes of LinkedIn. 'Instead, it is planning to offer enterprise collaboration.

Emotional: Sun Bin collapses in his father's arms, left, and finally gets to meet his younger sister, right . Family memories: Sun Bin and his father are photographed in 1991, just days before he was kidnapped . 'I still have this photo that was taken of him four days before he vanished,' Ku said at the reunion. 'I had been working selling vegetables in a food market in Chengdu and had taken him with me. I was dealing with a customer and when I looked round he had gone. 'All I had left of him was this photo taken during the mid-autumn festival, when he was four years and 15-days-old.' 'My wife and I travelled everywhere, and she became sick with worry over the years. She used to suffer from blackouts and I believe it was part of the reason that she eventually died before her time.' Ku and Lo finally stopped looking for Sun Bin in 1995 when they had another child, a daughter, but Lo never got over losing him and she died in 2011, of a 'broken heart'. Memories: Ku shows his son the last photograph of them together, taken in 1991 before the kidnapping . Family: Sun Bin, centre, with his father Ku, right, and the younger sister he never knew he had . Heartbreaking: Sun Bin visit's his mother Lo's grave with his father; she died in 2011 of a 'broken heart' Ku said: 'I gave up in 1995 because I need to spend time with the child I did have, and look after her health and provide for her. 'Before that though I travelled all over the country, every time there was a lead, followed it up. We found so many rescue children but we never found our son, and in 1995 we drew a line under it and stopped.' He said he had not expected much from the DNA database and was overjoyed when he got the call to say his son had been found. Police from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, said they are investigating the case and have arrested a suspectand accomplices who sold Sun Bin to his adoptive parents. Sun Bin says that although he is overjoyed with meeting his father and the sister he never knew he had, he is  saddened for his adoptive parents. He said: 'I don't want them to be punished, and I will look after and care for both my families.'","Sun Bin, 28, was kidnapped in Chengdu in 1991, when he was four .

"A lesbian couple have spoken of their fury after a security guard at a cinema ordered them to leave the ladies' toilets because he thought they were men. Tracey Seaton and Keira Williams had just watched a film at a branch of Cineworld when they popped into the loo. But they were followed in by a male guard, who accused them of being men and kicked them out of the area. Couple: Tracey Seaton, left, and Keira Williams, right, were asked to leave the women's toilets at a cinema . Miss Seaton, 28, and her 27-year-old partner Miss Williams had just watched the new film adaptation of Annie at the cinema in Ilford, east London. 'Just like most people, we went to the toilet after the film,' said Miss Seaton, who works as a lifeguard. 'It seems strange to say, but since we're women we went to the women's bathroom. 'But when we were washing our hands, this horrible guard came in and told us to get out. He said, ""Don't you know this is the women's bathroom?"" 'I've never been so angry and embarrassed in my entire life. He was adamant we were in the wrong toilet, and kept insisting on it. 'It was shocking treatment - they definitely need to be more gay-friendly. We're never going back.' Outrage: The couple say they were left 'angry and embarrassed' after the recent incident . The couple, who have been together for seven months, were offered £20 gift vouchers and two free tickets to the cinema as compensation for the way they were treated. However, they have turned down the offer and are calling on Cineworld to investigate the incident fully to ensure it never happens again. Miss Williams, a bookmaker, said: 'I just want them to train their staff on how to deal with these situations and on how to treat people appropriately. 'It was quite intimidating, and the guard didn't even bother to apologise. This is the first time either of us have ever experienced anything like it. It's disgusting.' Apology: Cineworld offered the pair compensation for the slur which took place at their Ilford branch, pictured . And Miss Seaton added: 'At the pool where I work, quite often people accidentally walk into the wrong changing room - but you don't have a go at them. 'Most people will correct their mistakes pretty quickly, and it's not for workers to decide the gender of customers based on their appearance.' A spokesman for Cineworld, which operates more than 800 screens across the UK, said: 'At Cineworld, we treat all customers equally regardless of gender, religion, race or sexuality. 'We have investigated this complaint fully and we have apologised to Tracey and Keira, in addition to offering them a goodwill gesture. 'In this case, our security staff were responding to concerns expressed by other customers. We recognise that this could have been handled more sensitively by our security staff. We have spoken to the staff concerned to ensure that this does not happen again in future.'","Tracey Seaton and Keira Williams went to Ilford Cineworld to watch Annie .

"Loft insulation may cut heating bills, but it is responsible for the decline of some of Britain’s most loved birds, a report claims. By filling in gaps in roofs that leak heat, homeowners are unwittingly reducing the number of potential nesting spaces. The energy-saving practice has so far contributed to a decline in the number of sparrows and house martins, among other species. Scroll down for video . Loft insulation has contributed to a decline in the number of sparrows (stock image) and house martins, among other species over the past 40 years, a new report suggests . The British Trust for Ornithology’s (BTO) BirdTrends report claims that sparrow numbers have dropped by 70 per cent since the 1960s, while starling and house martin populations are half of what they were 40 years ago. It says that sparrows living in urban and suburban areas have been affected the worst. Paul Stancliffe, a spokesman for the BTO, told the BBC: ‘As people are becoming more aware and better at insulating their lofts they are inadvertently taking away little nooks and crannies which have historically been used by the sparrow to nest.’ Paul Stancliffe, a spokesman for the BTO, said: ‘As people are becoming more aware and better at insulating their lofts (stock image)they are inadvertently taking away little nooks and crannies which have historically been used by the sparrow to nest.’ The report claims that sparrow numbers have dropped by 70 per cent since the 1960s (shown by this graph), while starling and house martin populations are half of what they were 40 years ago . The report summarises population trends for 120 breeding bird species across Britain & Ireland using data collected by volunteer surveyors. It provides habitat-specific trends for many species, highlighting those environments where species are in trouble. It says that many widespread and formerly common birds are experiencing severe declines, while targeted conservation is helping rare birds. A total of 28 species – a quarter of those surveyed – have suffered a fall in numbers of greater than 50 per cent over the last 35-45 years. As house martins also nest in holes, he believes they could have suffered because of insulation, as well as other factors such as less food at winter and people tidying up their gardens. Mr Stancliffe has recommended that people put up a nest box with a 32mm entrance as an alternative nesting space to holes in a roof. However, a lack of nesting sites does not explain why some bird species are struggling, because sparrows have also disappeared from areas with plenty of suitable sites. ‘This implies that other factors are probably involved,’ Mr Stancliffe said. The report suggests that many birds may benefit from help, as it found that 28 species were have been in decline over the past 40 years, including skylarks and cuckoos. John Marchant, co-author of the report, said: ‘The range of garden birds experiencing population declines appears to be increasing.’ As house martins also nest in holes constructed on ledges and nooks, the expert believes they could have suffered because of insulation, as well as other factors such as less food at winter . ‘While many will be familiar with the disappearance of house sparrow, starling and spotted flycatcher, it may surprise people to know that house martin, mistle thrush and greenfinch are heading in the same direction. ‘Again, there is evidence that house martin and mistle thrush declines are most pronounced around human habitation. The BTO will be launching a volunteer house martin survey in spring 2015 to find out more about the current distribution of breeding populations.’ However, the population of 18 birds such as magpies and wood pigeons doubled over the period. Mr Stancliffe explained: ‘Because these birds are generalists and not tied to specific habitats it allows them breed over wider parts of the country and therefore they are doing much better.’ Home owners can put up bird boxes to give sparrows and house martins places to nest, particularly if they have had their lofts insulated. Dave Leech, a Senior Research Ecologist at BTO said that more data is needed to help experts pinpoint specific problems and volunteers can help. So far, information generated by ringing birds and monitoring their nests has been used to find that the majority of farmland bird declines were driven by a reduction in food availability during the winter, while garden birds such as house starlings and greenfinches have been hit by a combination of reduced winter food availability and disease. House sparrows are struggling to rear enough chicks. ‘Data gathered by BTO ringers and nest recorders will help us to identify the mechanisms underlying declines of other species,’ he said.","Sparrow population has dropped by 70% because of lack of nesting sites .

"Families will start to feel they have more money each month, George Osborne will claim today as he urges Britain to 'celebrate' low inflation. The Chancellor will use a speech to claim the cost of living could start to fall within months after inflation dropped to a record low of 0.5 per cent. A supermarket price war and falling petrol prices means the Consumer Price Index rate of inflation is at its lowest point for almost 15 years. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne will use a speech to claim the cost of living could start to fall within months after inflation dropped to a record low of 0.5 per cent . The Consumer Prices Index takes into account the changing cost every aspect of daily life, including housing bills, food, transport and recreation. A rise of 0.5 per cent means an average basket of goods which cost £100 in December 2013 had risen to only £105 last month. Economists said that the continued plunge in the oil price means inflation is likely to fall further and that brief period of negative inflation was 'not entirely out of the question'. This would mean that average prices are falling, making life cheaper for most people. At the same time wages have started to rise, up 1.6 per cent in October, well ahead of falling inflation, which means people are better off in real terms. In a speech tonight to the Royal Economic Society, Mr Osborne will say: 'Of course we will always remain vigilant to ensure that inflation is low for the right reasons. 'But we should not confuse this welcome news for Britain's households as a result of falling oil prices with the threat of damaging deflation that we see in the eurozone. 'Rising real incomes, a recovery spreading to all parts of our economy, and family budgets that can stretch that little bit further - let's celebrate these effects of low inflation, not fear them.' Latest figures show that wages were up 1.6 per cent in October, well ahead of falling inflation . Sharp falls in food and transport costs were the biggest drivers in the fall in inflation to 0.5 per cent, the ONS said . Here are five key questions about the fall in inflation: . Why is inflation so low? The key drivers are falls in fuel and food costs. These are caused by tumbling oil prices, which are at their lowest level for nearly six years, and fierce supermarket competition, which has resulted in negative food and drink inflation for six months. Is it good news? Ultra-low inflation means the cost of living is barely rising, so wages give households more spending power than they would have. Experts say this should spur spending, boosting the economy and cheering voters ahead of the general election in May. What might it mean for interest rates? Policymakers tackle rising inflation by raising interest rates, so low inflation should push back the timing of any hike in rates, which have been held at 0.5% for nearly six years - easing the strain on mortgage borrowers but spelling more pain for savers. Is there any downside to falling inflation? Negative inflation, or deflation, could potentially lead to a spiral of falling prices in which consumers postpone purchases and firms cancel investment. If wages then fall repayments on loans such as mortgages would become less affordable. What might happen now? Economists predict inflation will continue to fall to new record lows of around 0.2% and some say there is an outside chance of a brief period of deflation, though the path is hard to predict given the volatile nature of oil prices. In addition to food and petrol bills falling, gas and electricity bills barely rose last month unlike last year when the Big Six came under fire for large price hikes. The fall in inflation will ease pressure on household budgets as it boosts real-terms pay as well as pushing further into the future any need to raise interest rates. The Bank of England’s governor Mark Carney said inflation was likely to ‘drift a little lower’ in the coming months, admitting that deflation is ‘possible’. He insisted that interest rates would ‘move up over the next couple of years’ – but economists say they are unlikely to rise before 2016. Mr Carney said: ‘By and large, these figures are good news in the short-term for British households. ‘[It] means your pound is going to stretch further. The issue is to make sure this doesn’t become more generalised... a little bit of inflation is good for the economy.’ The drop will trigger a letter of explanation from Mr Carney to the Chancellor, because it means inflation is more than 1 per cent off the Bank’s 2 per cent target. Mr Osborne will add: 'The low inflation we see here in the UK - driven as it is almost entirely by external factors such as the oil price - is much more welcome than in the eurozone where inflation has been very low for some time and is now negative. 'There the debate has understandably turned to the dangers of deflation - the risk of a self-reinforcing spiral where economic activity falters, consumers defer purchases as prices fall and nominal debt burdens become ever harder to manage.' Mr Osborne suggested the European Central Bank's (ECB) inflation target could be changed so it is obliged to take action when inflation is below 2 per cent - as well as above it. 'In the UK our system is well equipped to deal with negative inflation shocks just as it dealt with the surge in commodity prices in 2010 and 2011,' he said. 'A few months of very low or even negative inflation, driven mainly by external factors, does not in and of itself mean that we run the risk of deflation. 'Core inflation, which strips out those factors, remains relatively stable and indeed rose slightly in the data. 'Even more importantly, expectations about future inflation remain well anchored and the latest data show that earnings growth is accelerating not slowing down.' Labour's shadow Treasury minister Shabana Mahmood said: 'Plummeting global oil prices are the reason why the rate of inflation is falling here in Britain. 'But wages continue to be sluggish and the squeeze on living standards since 2010 means working people are £1,600 a year worse off under this government.'","Consumer Prices Index drops to 0.5%, the lowest level since May 2000 .

"The foster family of France's most wanted woman tried in vain to stop her marriage to kosher deli killer, Amedy Coulibaly, Mail Online can reveal. Femme fatale, Hayat Boumeddiene, who has been pictured in a burka with a crossbow, and has now fled to Syria, lived with the Benali family between the ages of eight and 17. Today they pleaded with her via MailOnline to 'come home'. Speaking for the first time, her foster brother, who insisted that he was not named, said that the family has done everything possible to block the marriage to the Islamic extremist who killed five people in Paris last week. He said: 'My dad, from the beginning, didn't agree with it because we didn't have the same culture and we didn't know him - he was a complete stranger. Scroll down for video . Division: The foster family of Hayat Boumeddiene (left) deeply disapproved of her marriage to Amedy Coulibaly (right), who killed four people at a Kosher deli in Paris . Estranged: Boumeddiene, seen here in a burka, cut ties with her adopted parents after her wedding to Coulibaly (left) Dangerous: Photo's have emerged of Boumeddiene, who's considered armed and dangerous, posing with a crossbow . 'We tried everything to avoid this wedding and did everything to convince her not to marry this man. 'Her father did not agree with the wedding either. In the end she insisted so much he ended up accepting. She was very in love I think.' No one in her substitute family ended up going to the wedding because of her opposition - the only person who went was Boumeddiene's own father. The Benali's are desperately worried about her safety in Syria. 'We don't know if she's going to make it out there', her foster brother pleaded. 'If we could speak to her we would say, ""come home, just come home"" – and we'll sort everything else out.' After meeting Coulibaly, her first boyfriend, aged 18 and marrying him two years later, Boumeddiene cut off contact and no longer visited her foster parents. The last time anyone in the family heard from her was in October when her Mr and Mrs Benali had returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca and she rang to congratulate them. She had also been to on a trip to Islam's holiest city, she told them. The 26-year-old originally came to live with the family, who had once been neighbours with her own, because her father - a delivery driver - couldn't take care of his eight children after the death of Boumeddiene's mother. 'Her father couldn't cope. Her brother was only two years old when their mother died. Their dad left the kids at home when he was working.' 'She went to live in care homes and it didn't go well. She was naughty so they didn't want her any more.' The kind-hearted family broke their silence about Boumesdiene's troubled upbringing as it emerged that Coulibaly had been severely affected as a teen, by witnessing the death of a 19-year-old schoolmate at the hands of police. Mugshots: Police photos of Boumeddiene, who has fled abroad, and her husband, who was killed by police . Chilling: A video of Amedy Coulibaly emerged after he had killed four hostages at a Kosher deli in Paris . Coulibaly appeared to suffer profound guilt and anger after his classmate Ali Rezgui was shot in the back five times as the friends tried to flee police on the grim estate, the dead boy's lawyer told Mail Online today. While also troubled, Boumeddienne temporarily found the stability she craved at the Benali family home. The Algerian couple were happy to take her in even though they had eight children of their own to bring up. 'For us it's just being human and she needed help', her foster brother explained. The youngster was not religious when she lived with the family, they explained. She did not pray and the only religious practice she followed was the Ramadan fast. Her foster sibling said: 'She loved nature and the countryside and was very generous. If she had a bit of money she would buy us presents like clothes.' He added: 'But she didn't have many friends. She did not go out a lot.' The Islamist bride eventually left the family home at 17 after she got a job as a cashier and got her own apartment. The Benali family condemned last weeks attacks as 'horrific' and, although they didn't believe Boumeddiene was involved, they said they were 'disappointed' that she had gone to Syria 'as it showed how much she had changed'. Her foster brother said that the Benali family were closer to her than her real family and could not believe she had anything to do with the attacks last week: 'We were in shock when we saw her on TV - we were really upset.' Brief stay: For two nights in Istanbul, Boumeddiene, who has been described as armed and dangerous, slept in room 102 – where a picture of the Eiffel Tower hangs above the bed . No-frills: The jihadi widow checked into Bade Otel in Kadikoy, on the Asian side of the city, on January 2 after flying into Istanbul’s Sabiha Gokcen airport . Basic: The room came with a shabby bathroom, a TV, a double and single bed - and a picture of the Eiffel Tower on the wall . 'We couldn't believe it. We consider her our daughter and sister. We don't understand because when she was young, she worked hard, she had good grades. 'She really wanted to succeed in life that's the only thing that counted for her. ' At around the same age, Coulibaly was also on a path to success and was 'well integrated' lawyer, Pierre Mairat said today. Mr Mairat who represented the family of teen Ali Rezgui who was killed by police said: 'Coulibaly was well integrated. He was completely French. He was close to finishing high school and doing well.' But aged 18, he made a fatal error taking part with four others in the attempted theft of several motorbikes from the garage of an apartment block. When police arrived his friend fled and was shot in the back five times by a police officer who was still an intern. The lawyer said he believed the event played 'a huge part' in his personal history and was a very important element in the person he became later. He said: 'When he saw his best friend being killed by police officer he reacted with various emotions, firstly guilt because he knew he did something wrong. 'The second feeling was that of injustice because the police reaction was disproportionate and illegitimate and the third is the feeling of discrimination towards himself and young people like him from two major institutions, the police that killed his friend illegitimately and the justice system that didn't do their job.'","Hayat Boumeddiene is wanted in connection to the hostage-taking in Paris .

For the first time, researchers have grown a muscle that moves and works just like fibres found in the human the body. Made from human cells, the lab-grown artificial muscle tissue responded to electrical pulses (pictured), as well as drug treatments in the same way a hospital patient would . The muscle could also be used to study diseases, and be used in place of human drug trials. The study was led by Nenad Bursac, associate professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University, and Lauran Madden, a postdoctoral researcher in Professor Bursac's laboratory. ‘The beauty of this work is that it can serve as a test bed for clinical trials in a dish,’ said Professor Bursac. Scientists have grown 'fully-functioning' human gut tissue inside a mouse - a breakthrough that could one day help many thousands suffering with intestinal disorders. By transplanting cells from a human into a mouse, paediatric surgeons successfully grew small intestine tissue that worked just like the 'real' thing. The research was led by Dr Tracy Grikscheit from the Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA). Doctors hope their findings will eventually help treat a range of digestive conditions as well as boost survival rates in sufferers of diseases such as short bowel syndrome (SBS) - a condition that kills nearly a third of young patients within five years. ‘We are working to test drugs without jeopardising a patient's health and also to reproduce the functional and biochemical signals of diseases - especially rare ones and those that make taking muscle biopsies difficult.’ Professor Bursac and Ms Madden started with a small sample of human cells that had already progressed beyond stem cells, but hadn't yet become muscle tissue. They expanded these by more than a 1000-fold, and then put them into a form of 3D scaffolding filled with a nourishing gel. This gel helped the cells to form aligned and functioning muscle fibres. Ms Madden put the new muscle through a series of tests to determine how closely it resembled tissue found in the human body. She found that the muscle fibres robustly contracted in response to electrical stimuli - a first for human muscle grown in a laboratory. She also showed that the signalling pathways allowing nerves to activate the muscle were 'intact and functional'. The experts started with a small sample of human cells that had already progressed beyond stem cells but hadn't yet become muscle tissue. They expanded these by more than a 1000-fold, and put them into a form of scaffolding filled with gel. This gel helped the cells to form aligned and functioning muscle fibres (pictured) ‘We have a lot of experience making bioartifical muscles from animal cells in the lab, and it still took us a year of adjusting variables like cell and gel density and optimising the culture matrix and media to make this work with human muscle cells,’ said Ms Madden. To see if the muscle could be used for medical tests, Professor Bursac and Mr Madden also studied its response to a variety of drugs, including statins used to lower cholesterol and clenbuterol, a drug known to be used off-label as a performance enhancer for athletes. The effects of the drugs matched those seen in human patients. ‘One of our goals is to use this method to provide personalised medicine to patients,’ said Professor Bursac. ‘We can take a biopsy from each patient, grow many new muscles to use as test samples and experiment to see which drugs would work best for each person.’ The research is published in the journal eLife.

"A teenage gymnast who suffered a career-ending spine injury at the age of ten has revealed how she managed to make an unlikely return as one of the sport's top-ranked athletes. Annie Hilton, 14, from Southern California, who is starring in Gatorade's new Win From Within campaign, was working towards earning a place on the US women's national gymnastics team when a simple mistake during a floor routine left her with a fractured neck. But while that injury alone should not have kept her from competing, the pre-teen suffered another devastating blow when doctors diagnosed her with dyslastic spondylolisthesis, a congenital spine disorder which prevented her vertebrae from fusing together. Scroll down for video . Top of her game: Annie Hilton, 14, made an astonishing return to gymnastics after undergoing spinal surgery . Star athlete: The gymnast was just ten when she was forced to take more than a year off in order to recover . Annie was forced to undergo painful surgery in order for doctors to put screws in her spine. The procedure left her bedridden for a number of months, with experts predicting that she would then have to spent another year in recovery. 'Annie had a mishap on floor one day, took off wrong and landed on top of her head,' Southern California Elite Gymnastics Academy coach Kathy Strate explains in the Gatorade video. 'It turned out to be an injury that just needed time to heal, it wasn't in any way a career-ending or serious injury. But as her neck was healing, she noticed that her back was hurting. 'Most kids who take a year or more off do not make a comeback in a sport like this. Gymnastics was over for her.' 'My dream was to compete at World's and to be on the national team for gymnastics,' Annie said. 'When they told me I would have to take a year off, I was devastated.' Down but not out: Annie initially thought that her injury would take just a matter of months to heal . 'Frustrated': Doctors later diagnosed Annie with a severe spinal disorder which required painful and complex surgery . During the first few months of her recovery, Annie was incredibly frustrated and angry at how helpless she felt. 'I like trying to feel like I'm independent, but people had to do everything for me; I couldn't even walk on my own,' she recalled. Her father Dan admits that watching his daughter struggle with just the simplest of tasks was heart-breaking for Annie's family - but to witness her passion slowly start to return as her recovery quickened gave them all the determination and motivation they needed to help her return to her beloved sport. 'I just remember when she was walking across the room three feet, she was so frustrated, she couldn't stand up,' he said. 'But by the time she was walking to the end of the hallway, that was almost when the light switch turned on and she could see she was making progress.' Determination: Annie has had to dedicate endless hours towards ensuring that she was able to regain her skills . Flying high: The teen defied doctors' expectations when she returned to the gym after just 13 months of recovery . After 13 months of recovery, Annie was finally given the all-clear by doctors and told that she could start to try other forms of physical activity, beyond walking. But while many believed that the hardest part of her recovery was over, Annie had to face yet another seemingly impossible battle - returning to gymnastics and attempting to regain all of the skills that she had lost during her time away from the sport. 'When I would reach down to touch my toes, I would get to about my knees,' Annie said. 'My arms especially - I lost all of my upper body strength. 'It was really hard. I felt so weak.' But her determination and unwavering self-belief paid off, and within a year, the teenager was competing - and winning - at national competitions once again. Comeback kid: Annie's goal is to get a full college scholarship so that she can continue competing at the highest level . 'I'm fearless': The young gymnast has managed to overcome every obstacle put in her way . '[Annie] doesn't get down, she just keeps working and working and working,' coach Kathy said. 'I thought that it was very possible that she could compete the next year. And she was ready to go by the first meet. And she competed not one event, but all four events. 'It's the best comeback story I've seen in 25 years. And the way she's going, she's going to reach her ultimate goal, which is to get a full ride scholarship.' 'These things just happen and when they do, you have to be ready, you have to put all of your effort into it,' Annie added. 'What makes me different is that, I'm fearless.'","Annie Hilton was competing as one of America's top young gymnasts when she broke her neck during a tricky routine at the age of ten .

"Tens of thousands of people a year are dying unnecessarily of cancer simply because they are elderly or poor, a report has revealed. The National Audit Office, which analysed the latest NHS figures, accused the health service of age discrimination when it came to cancer patients’ care. It said if the cancer mortality rates of the poorest people were brought up to the level of the most well-off, there would be almost 20,000 fewer deaths every single year. The National Audit Office found cancer mortality rates of the poorest people were brought up to the level of the most well-off, there would be almost 20,000 fewer deaths every single year (file picture) ‘Significant variations and inequalities in outcomes and access to services persist,’ the report stated. ‘Outcomes and access to services are generally poorer for older patients. And those from more deprived socio-economic groups are more likely to experience worse outcomes compared with those from less deprived groups.’ For all cancer patients, five-year survival rates are still 10 per cent behind the average for the six most wealthy European nations. In Sweden, 64 per cent of cancer patients are still alive after five years but in England it is just 49 per cent. For patients aged 75 and above, the gap is even worse. Pressure on NHS resources could mean that progress on survival rates ‘stalls’ in the coming years. ‘Poorer access to treatment or poorer quality of care’ is mostly to blame for the gaps, according to the report. Sweden . Germany . France . Norway . Italy . European Average . England . 64.2 % . 59.8% . 59.3% . 56.2% . 56.1 % . 54.6% . 49.1% . It continues: ‘People in England are less likely to develop cancer than in other high-income countries in Europe but, according to the most recent data, cancer outcomes in England have generally been worse. ‘Outcomes are particularly poor in relative terms for older patients.’ Those aged 55 to 64 are about 20 per cent more likely to survive a year after being diagnosed with cancer than those aged 75 or more. This is much too large a gap to be explained by frailty alone, according to the NAO, indicating that age discrimination may be at least partly to blame. Meanwhile, waiting times for urgent cancer treatment are increasing, with the number of NHS trusts failing to meet targets doubling in a year to 64. From last July to September alone, some 5,500 patients waited more than 62 days for treatment. The damning report comes at a difficult time for the Coalition, which is already having to explain why there is an A&E crisis, with waiting times at record levels. The National Audit Office accused the health service of age discrimination when it came to cancer patients’ care (file picture) Last night Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said she was ‘deeply disappointed’ by the ‘shocking disparity’ in cancer survival rates compared with Europe. ‘There are also unacceptable inequalities within England that must be tackled,’ she added. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said he accepted that survival rates needed to improve. ‘Cancer survival rates in England are at an all-time high ... it’s time for a fresh look at how we can do even better – with more focus on prevention, earlier diagnosis and modern radiotherapy and other services so that over the next five years we can save at least 8,000 more lives a year.’ He added: ‘We have established an independent cancer taskforce to produce a new five-year cancer strategy by the summer, which will set out what needs to be done to achieve this ambition.’","National Audit Office accuse NHS of age discrimination of cancer patients .

Ciarria Johnson, 21, has been charged with negligent homicide . She returned to find the house 'completely engulfed in flames,' reports NBC News. Johnson reportedly told investigators that she returned to her home to find the house engulfed in flames, the marshal's office said, reports Nola.com. But authorities believe she did not return home until after she was told about the fire. Johnson told authorities that she arranged for a neighbor to look after her children. But she hadn't, the deputy chief, said reports CNN. 'While investigators of the state fire marshal's office are still piecing together their findings in the tragic fire that occurred on Pruett Street, one thing is certain: Ciarria Johnson … left her children unattended for hours as she was having her hair styled,' according to a statement from the state fire marshal. A control valve on a gas heater in the living room, where the fire is believed to have started, was found in the 'on' position, the statement said. It added the fire likely started because of flammable materials being too close to the heater. The Fire Marshal's Office says Johnson is charged with two counts of negligent homicide in the death of her children.

There were 149 airlines which achieved seven-stars while 58 scored six stars and almost 41 had just three stars or less. All five of the most dangerous airlines listed are banned in the European Union Member States and ‘strongly advised against’ in the United States. For all its problems with two tragic flights in 2014, Malaysia Airlines earned five out of seven stars. The airline was involved in two major crashes last year when Flight MH370 went missing in March 2014 carrying 239 people.

That plane is still missing without a trace. The flight is believed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean. In July 2014, MH17 was hit by a missile as they it was flying over the Ukraine during its battle with Russia. It killed 298 people on-board. In comparison, the airlines that received just one star have experienced a high number of accidents.

In 2010, 22 people were killed when a Tara Air flight crashed shortly after take-off from Lamidanda Airport in Nepal, while earlier this year Nepal Airlines Flight 183 crashed on its way to Arghakhanchi. In January 2013, all 21 people on board SCAT Airlines flight from Kokshetau to Almaty died when the aircraft crashed in poor weather near Kyzyltu. AirlineRatings.com, the world’s only safety and product rating website, which was launched in June 2013. The website, a joint initiative between The West Australian and Aerospace Technical Publications International, said its rating system is based on audits from the industry’s governing bodies and governments, plus an airline’s fatality record. All four of the most dangerous airlines listed are banned in the European Union Member States and ‘strongly advised against’ in the United States . But the study is overshadowed by an awful 12 months for airline safety with some of the most tragic and bizarre incidents in modern history, as the report points out. There were 21 fatal accidents last year – a record low at one for every 1.3 million flights – but the 986 fatalities were higher than the 10-year average largely due to two unprecedented tragedies involving Malaysia Airlines, which accounted for 537 deaths. Despite those high-profile incidents – plus last month’s deadly crash of AirAsia flight QZ8501 - the report insists air travel is the safest method of transportation. The world’s airlines carried a record 3.3 billion passengers on 27 million flights last year . The world’s airlines carried a record 3.3 billion passengers on 27 million flights. Fifty years ago there were a staggering 87 crashes, killing 1,597 people, when airlines carried only 141 million passengers – five per cent of today’s total, the report says. The website has also announced its top ten safest airlines and top ten safest low cost airlines. Airline Ratings uses several elements to create its seven star system, consulting International Air Transport Association figures along with government information and crash data. The questions it asks are: . Is the airline IOSA (IATA Operational Safety Audit) certified? Is the airline on the European Union (EU) Blacklist? Has the airline maintained a fatality free record for the past 10 years? Is the airline FAA (America's Federal Aviation Administration) endorsed? Does the country of airline origin meet all 8 ICAO safety parameters? Has the airline's fleet been grounded by the country's governing aviation safety authority due to safety concerns? Does the airline operate only Russian built aircraft? It named Australia’s national airline as the safest on the planet. With a ‘fatality free record’ in the jet era, Qantas scored top marks out of nearly 450 carriers monitored by aviation safety review website. The Australian-based website ranked the rest of its top ten in alphabetical order, with British Airways, Gulf carriers Emirates and Etihad Airways, and Lufthansa finding a place on the list.","AirAsia subsidiaries on list, but Malaysia Airlines scores five out of seven .

"An Australian commuter turned a boring subway trip on a recent holiday in Hong Kong into a fun pun game to pass the time by. Melbourne student, Scyler Yang, came up with the idea of creating the puns from the stations on the subway map with his sister on a 15-minute journey from from Admiralty to Mong Kok while on a family trip two weeks ago. The Malaysian national is a self-confessed 'punster' which he says is not always appreciated by his friends. Scyler Yang came up with the idea of creating the puns from the stations on the subway map with his sister . The 21-year-old was on a subway in Hong Kong with his family about two weeks ago at the time . The siblings made up eight puns during the 15 minute journey then Scyler was inspired to do more later . 'I believe I'm like many of the other Punsters out there - usually making puns among their other (relatively normal) friends in daily life and they all respond with rolling eyes and helpless cries,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'So I suppose I just felt like making puns when I saw the perfect opportunity on the train, especially when the carriage wasn't seriously crowded like how it would usually be.' The 21 year old engineering student came up with eight of the puns on the short train trip. 'One of my sisters and I decided to look at the map of the train line, and we started thinking of puns,' he said. 'When we found a (presumably) good one, I would align and take a picture with my phone camera, so I could edit them later. 'The rest, which are cropped, from an online map, was further inspired by the Singaporeans' version of the MRT puns.' So has Scyler's new-found recognition for his puns impressed his mates? 'Well, my closer friends typically have the usual rolling of eyes, while others came to congratulate me for my recent slight uprising in Internet fame,' he said.

"An artist who has no artistic ability while awake but can create masterpieces in his sleep has turned a gallery in a 'bedroom' for his first solo exhibition. Lee Hadwin, 39,  replicated the sleeping environment where he produces his paintings and is now displaying them at a gallery in Croydon, south London. His condition, which has reportedly been medically proven, sees him drawing on walls, tables, clothes and discarded newspapers with various materials - from pens and crayons to paints and coal. Scroll down for video . Artist Lee Hadwin, who creates paintings in his sleep, has transformed an art gallery into his sleeping environment for an exhibition of his work . He has attracted worldwide interest in his unusual ability, which manifested at the age of four, when he first started producing 'scribbles'. By the time he was in his mid-teens, the drawings were becoming more detailed. Mr Hadwin, who has had no training or inclination in his waking life to be an artist, has sold sleep pieces for six-figure sums in the past with previous buyers including Derren Brown and Donald Trump. He often wakes up with horrendous migraines after a night's drawing and can be sick as a result, and says it has been a nightmare proving he's not a hoaxer. Mr Hadwin, originally from Wales but now lives in London with his partner Clint, has been for various tests at the Edinburgh Sleep Clinic with experts going back over his school work to see if he is lying. He draws on walls, tables, clothes and discarded newspapers with various materials - from pens and crayons to paints and coal - while asleep . His condition began at the age of four when he started scribbling and by his mid-teens the drawing were becoming more and more detailed . He said: 'It can happen two-to-three times a week that I get out of bed and draw in my sleep. 'But then then it might be another two weeks before I do it again. I sometimes go away and come back to finish a piece off. 'When I wake up, I know I have done something but I don't know what.' The exhibition, Hypnos, which begins on January 16, takes inspiration from Greek mythology, and its title is based on the namesake and god of sleep, whose son Morpheus was the deity of dreams.

Last year, Ikea revealed a £465 ($706) desk that's designed to be used standing up, with a mechanism that allows it to become a conventional desk at the touch of a button. Experts say that changing from a seated to a standing desk can improve productivity and similar desks have become a common sight at tech firms such as Google, where some employees have even installed treadmill and bicycle desks. The desk, which arguably encourages laziness, bucks a recent trend for promoting exercise in the office. This BigRig mechanical desk generates electrical current as a worker pedals to power small gadgets . The American Medical Association (AMA) says that sitting for extended periods of time can be bad for personal health, with global studies suggesting that we sit for an average of 7.7 hours a day, with some people remaining seated for 15 hours. There are more active desks too. The BigRig mechanical desk generates electrical current as a worker pedals a bike-inspired mechanism to power gadgets, but it costs $2,400 (£1,467) because it is hand-crafted. Designed by a start-up company called Pedal Power, the BigRig desk can be used to power computers, or can even be put to more domestic tasks, as well as boosting workers' fitness levels. Standing desks have become commonplace across Silicon Valley, offering health benefits to those willing to work on their feet and last year Ikea launched a 'budget' version for £465 ($706). The Bekant desk has a button that allows workers to change it back to the height of a standard desk, if they want a break. Similarly, the $3,890 Stir Kinect desk has a motor to raise and lower itself, converting it into a standing desk or a traditional desk.

"Many years ago - aged 13 - I came to North Wales on a mountain-climbing trip and nearly died. My teacher lost a small group of us near the top of a foggy peak on Snowdonia, and we had to be guided down by a stranger. Three decades on, I'm back, now with my wife and family. Where the seagulls fly: Anglesey offers pretty seascapes, quiet harbours and gentle getaways . We're on the island of Anglesey, overlooking the mainland. So, what greets me in the distance when I open the curtains on our first morning? Those same scary mountains. This time, though, they fill me with joy. It's a bright, sunny day and the Menai Strait, the thin band of water that separates this small island from 'proper' Wales, is sparkling like a Seventies' disco glitter ball. It's a blissful scene. Long shadows, tiny fluffs of clouds, the sound of seagulls. We are staying for two nights at the Chateau Rhianfa, built 165 years ago as a dower house by an eccentric local baronet to mimic a Loire Valley chateau. Its baroque arches and turrets look mighty peculiar plonked on the Welsh coast. Messing about in boats: Cemaes Bay, on the north coast of Anglesey, is an especially lovely location . The house is laid out as if a grand family still lives there. Dinner is served in a wood-panelled banqueting hall and there's the sweet smell of wood smoke wherever you go. My wife and I wallow in the peace of the place. But is there anything to keep our young children occupied? Absolutely. We head to Anglesey Sea Zoo, a slightly silly name for a very good aquarium. The children, George and Daisy, are amused by tales of spiny lobsters that crawl for thousands of miles nose to tail with hundreds of their chums along the seabed from Wales to the Mediterranean. I'm intrigued by the idea that bream can change their sex if they need to. Outside, there's an inflatable slide, crazy golf and ice cream. We spend the day there before going for a plate of local mussels at Dylan's Restaurant in Menai. The next day we aim for Beaumaris Castle, ten minutes from the hotel. Built by Edward I in the 13th century, it is an impressive ruin with a pretty moat. But it is not shown off to its best advantage. My lot want to know what it was like to live there when it was a military command centre. So do I. Towers and turrets: Chateau Rhianfa is one of Anglesey's more idiosyncratic accommodation options . Where did the warriors eat their rations (and what did they eat)? Where did they sleep? What weapons did they have? We leave a little disappointed and then, by accident, stumble across two brilliant places: the town's 400-year-old courthouse and a sinister Victorian prison, which are no longer in use and have been opened to the public. Talk about 'access all areas' - nothing is behind perspex. You are encouraged to walk where you like, touch what you want. We read the graffiti the prisoners carved into the floor and lie on prison issue hammocks. The good news: if you were condemned to death, the night before the hanging you got to sleep in a cell twice the size that of the other inmates. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge grew to love Anglesey and were sorry to leave. Now I know the feeling.

"The Massachusetts doctor who beat Ebola plans to return to Liberia, where he contracted the deadly virus, in order to help overworked colleagues in the missionary hospital where he has worked for years. Dr. Rick Sacra, 52, of Holden, said Monday he won't be working directly with Ebola patients but might be asked to help from time to time, since doctors say he's now immune. He departs Thursday. 'The medical staff is a little bit reduced. They've been working very hard and frankly they need a little bit of a breather,' he said at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, where he is an assistant professor. 'I just feel the need to return to hopefully give them a break so they don't burn out.' Brave man: Dr. Rick Sacra talks about going back into the Ebola hot zone as his wife Debbie listens on Monday in Worcester, Massachusetts . Immune: Sacra, who beat Ebola plans to return to Liberia, where he contracted the deadly virus, in order to help overworked colleagues in the missionary hospital where he has worked for years . But Sacra said he has no interest in testing his immunity and promised to follow all the necessary Ebola safety protocols. He expects to be mostly treating patients with malaria and chronic health issues like high blood pressure and diabetes at ELWA, a hospital in the Liberian capital of Monrovia that is run by Serving In Mission, a North Carolina-based Christian organization. 'I guess I'm less nervous about this trip because the thing that I was afraid of having last time, I've had it, and, thank God, I'm through it,' Sacra said. Sacra contracted Ebola in August while caring for pregnant women not suspected to have Ebola, including delivering babies and performing several cesarean sections. He was treated and released from an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital in September. Still fighting: Sacra returns to a country and a region that appears to be turning a corner in controlling the spread of Ebola, which has claimed over 8,000 lives, mostly in the West African nations of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea . As of this month, the World Health Organization says at least 8,153 people have died in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The Geneva-based body said January 5 that the total number of confirmed, probable and suspected deaths from the disease comes from 20,656 cases in the three most affected countries - a mortality rate of 39 percent. The U.N. health agency says 2,915 deaths have been reported from Sierra Leone, 3,471 in Liberia and 1,767 in Guinea. The current outbreak, which began about a year ago, has also claimed more than dozen lives elsewhere. The patient has been admitted to Royal Glamorgan Hospital, near Llantrisant . Sacra said he's nearly at full strength now, after some 'bumps in the road' to recovery that included treatment for vision problems, physical therapy and an upper respiratory tract infection that briefly sent him back to the hospital in October. 'I think of those in Liberia that are having to deal with all these same challenges, with so much less help than I've had,' he said. Sacra returns to a country and a region that appears to be turning a corner in controlling the spread of Ebola, which has claimed over 8,000 lives, mostly in the West African nations of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, according to the World Health Organization. During a recent three-week period, the organization reported 70 confirmed new cases of Ebola in Liberia, compared to some 900 in neighboring Sierra Leone and over 300 in Guinea. Sacra also noted that each country now has enough beds to treat Ebola patients, and that four out of every 10 Ebola patients are now surviving the virus. Sacra is among at least 10 people - a majority of them health care workers - that have been treated in the U.S. Two of those patients have died. He is the first U.S. patient to return to West Africa. A British nurse, William Pooley, returned to Sierra Leone in October after being treated in London in September.

"Newly-elected NSW Labor leader Luke Foley has come clean about two drink-driving convictions in an effort to avoid the offences hurting his upcoming election campaign. Mr Foley admitted the offences, saying he was caught by random breath tests, once at age 23 in 1993, and again in 2007, the Daily Telegraph reported. In the first incident, 44-year-old Mr Foley said he blew about 0.07 after leaving a party in Goulburn, south of Sydney, but because his offence was low-range his licence was suspended for only a fortnight. Scroll down for video . Newly-elected NSW Labor leader Luke Foley has come clean about two drink-driving convictions . Mr Foley was 36 at the time of the 2007 incident, in which he blew 0.085 while driving home from a Labor Party fundraiser, and his licence was suspended for nine months. Mr Foley, who was elected unopposed to the head of the party less than two weeks ago, said he was ashamed of the convictions. 'I'm not proud of this, in fact I’m ashamed. I've never pretended to be a perfect person but I think it's important I'm honest and upfront with people right from the start of my leadership,' he said. 'Now that I have this job, I feel I need to disclose everything about myself, warts and all. I have paid the price.' Both incidences occurred before Mr Foley entered parliament, however he was working for the Labor party when he committed the 2007 offence. Mr Foley was elected unopposed as leader of the NSW Labor Party 10 days ago, ahead of the state election in March. Mr Foley said he was caught by random breath tests, once at age 23 in 1993, and again in 2007 . Mr Foley replaced John Robertson (pictured) as opposition leader who quit after admitting to signing a letter on behalf of Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis as his local MP in 2011 . Mr Foley, who was environment and planning spokesman, replaced John Robertson as opposition leader who quit after admitting to signing a letter on behalf of Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis as his local MP in 2011. He was the only nominee for the party's leadership and was elected unopposed. Linda Burney continues to serve as deputy leader. NSW is due to go to the polls in March, with the Mike Baird-led coalition heavily favoured to be returned. Mr Foley will now try to switch from the upper house of parliament to the lower house. He's expected to push to become the ALP's candidate for the western Sydney seat of Auburn, held by Labor's Barbara Perry. Mr Foley is from the party's left faction and a devoted Catholic who opposes gay marriage.","NSW Labor leader Luke Foley admitted two drink-driving convictions .

"Scaling the 3,000ft sheer granite face of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park without bolts or climbing tools had been dubbed the 'climb of the century' for good reason - but on Wednesday afternoon two daredevils did it. Tommy Caldwell, 36, and Kevin Jorgeson, 30, spent two and a half grueling weeks scaling El Capitan's so-called Dawn Wall in a feat some had deemed impossible, their hands left bleeding and torn as they inched their way up.

Ms Van Nieuwenhuyzen, of Rochester, Minnesota, said she can't wait to hug her younger brother. 'I'm just going to hug. Just hug. No words necessary,' she said. 'It's such a big moment that a congratulatory hug is going to be very soothing to my big sister soul.' The pair started climbing on December 27 using the free-climbing technique that shuns climbing aids other than harnesses and ropes to prevent deadly falls.

They plan to discuss the climb on Thursday. Kevin Jorgeson, pictured wtih his girlfriend Jacqui . Becca Caldwell (right), who is married to Tommy Caldwell, was on the ground with their toddler son . Throughout the climb, both men needed to take rest days to allow their skin to heal. They used tape and even superglue to help with the process. At one point, Caldwell set an alarm to wake him every four hours to apply a special lotion to his throbbing hands. They also took physical punishment when their grip would slip, pitching them into long, swinging falls that left them bouncing off the rock face. The tumbles, which they called 'taking a whipper,' ended in startling jolts from their safety ropes. Eric Jorgeson, Kevin Jorgeson's father, told KGO-TV that his son has always been a climber and watching him fulfill a long-time dream made  him proud. 'He climbed everything he could think of. It made us nervous early on as parents, but we got used to it,' the father said. 'It was more other parents saying, ''Hey, your son is at the top of a backstop.''' The two started climbing El Capitan (there are more than 100 routes to the top) when Kevin Jorgeson turned 15, and it has been a birthday tradition ever since.

"I really wasn't sure what to expect in Egypt. Having travelled the world for over 17 years as a model, I've been fortunate to visit some amazing countries for shoots. But Egypt is a country I had never been to before and, yes, there were nerves considering all the negative publicity Egypt has been getting since the revolution. Even my grandmother asked me did I really think it was a good idea to take my son James! Hand in hand: Alison and toddler son James take a stroll on the sand next to the Kempinski hotel . We flew from London Gatwick and the flight was an easy five hours. We flew on easyJet, and they are fantastic. A bit like the old Ryanair, though, as you are only allowed one piece of carry-on luggage - so we had to check in James's case. But other than that I really enjoyed the flight. I love their on-board menu as they have great healthy options and coconut water, which is my travel essential, especially for flying, as it's great for rehydration. When we arrived at the airport it was a little chaotic with lots of men holding boards with people's names on them. This is where flying with a company like Holiday Designers makes a difference. Our driver picked us up and put our visas in our passports and immediately made me feel safe and well looked after. You need to make sure you have in cash for each visa. James was a little tired and fell asleep in the car on the way to the hotel. Soma Bay is about 45 minutes from Hurghada airport. It was dark when we arrived, but the entrance to the Sheraton was very impressive and beautifully lit. We settled into our room and headed straight for dinner, as we were starving. We ate in the Italian restaurant and I had the set menu. If you are staying full board you don't need to worry about extra bills at the end of your trip, and I do always recommend this option as costs can creep up otherwise. An oasis on the edge of the water: Alison and James spent part of their break at the Kempinski hotel . James was so excited. When he saw the pool he was speechless, and wanted to go swimming straight away (yes in the dark). The next morning at breakfast he didn't even really eat because of the excitement. He went to the kids' club in the Sheraton on the second day and I headed over to the spa. It did not disappoint. The Cascades Spa & Thalasso Soma Bay is recognised as the best in Egypt, and one of the largest in the world. The Thalasso Tonic Hydrotherapy Pool contains 830 cubic metres of sea water sub-divided into a number of distinct zones - with water jets, currents, counter-currents, showers and bubbling baths. Each one is designed to provide comfort and to regenerate and tone a specific part of your body. It's amazing for breaking down cellulite and fat - so, needless to say, instead of the recommended 20 seconds when the jets were at my legs and bottom, I took considerably longer. The man who was working there quickly understood what I was doing. We both burst out laughing. In one of the areas I tried, he told me to swim with the current. It was an amazing experience, as the current moves you around really fast. But then he asked me to walk against the current, and that was tough. But he said it's amazing for your legs. I wish we had a Thalasso in Ireland. Ready for a quick dip: James prepares for a snorkelling adventure - and a meeting with Nemo . When I got back, James was smiling from ear to ear, eating pizza and chips in the kids' club. James loved Ahmed who ran the club. They played football and built sandcastles while I relaxed. The beach at the Sheraton was out of this world. I couldn't stop pinching myself as I stared into the crystal clear blue waters. James and I went on adventures, crab hunting - and finding dinosaur bones and teeth (coral, really). We even found dinosaur tracks (birds, really) as James said they have three toes. He was so excited and couldn't believe how lucky he was. We found a crab and a jellyfish. I absolutely love discovering things through a child's eyes. Children really make you appreciate the beauty in everything. We did a mixture of beach and pool for the rest of our stay at the Sheraton. We loved both. James had his new swim-fin, which gave him great confidence in the water. There were a lot of Europeans there, but I was amazed that the British and Irish have yet to really discover Soma Bay. It's so close and so beautiful, and it ticks so many boxes. If you want a family holiday where you can relax and feel confident that your kids are safe and having fun, Soma Bay is ideal. We transferred to the Kempinski for the last three days. Wow, what a welcome. The hospitality was incredible. We stayed in a hotel within a hotel! Okay, so let me explain. There is a club within the Kempinski hotel called the Laguna Club. It has its own restaurant for breakfast and dinner. We had an ocean view, which allowed us to see  incredibly breathtaking sunsets. If you want luxury, you must stay here. Beautifully designed: Alison also stayed at Soma Bay's Sheraton Hotel, with its extensive swathe of space . They even offer a selection of pillows, scented baths and great children's amenities. Again, we favoured the beach, as it was simply stunning. James made friends with lots of other kids, and he had a ball while I relaxed watching him. James had the biggest bubble baths ever. The bath looks out to the ocean and James said to me 'mum I can see how beautiful the sky looks from here'. He passed out most evenings very early, so I used to sit on the balcony reading a book. The kids' club in the Kempinski was fantastic. They offer a full daily schedule, and you can drop the kids off and pick them up at your leisure. When they were down at the beach James joined in, or joined them for a movie in the afternoon. But as he's my buddy and I'm also a child we played on the beach and built sandcastles most of the day. Our final couple of days were full of adventures. James went snorkelling right out in the ocean. I couldn't believe it. It was quite windy but the instructor was amazing. At one stage I thought James was panicking, but he was trying to get his snorkel out of his mouth to inform me he had seen Nemo and also Dory... but she probably wouldn't remember. Water features: There are plenty of pools for splashing, and sunloungers for a few hours' relaxation . We also rode on camels and went on a glass-bottomed boat. It was so much fun. There are also lots of day trips you can take to Luxor and even Cairo, but we stayed put as I needed a rest. For a winter sun break Soma Bay really is perfect. A five-hour flight and you are in paradise. The water is crystal clear and the beaches have the most beautiful white sand I have ever seen. The one thing I noticed is that, although these are big hotels, they don't feel overcrowded. Everything is very well designed, and even on the beach you have great space between the seats. Everywhere is very family-friendly, and no matter what your interest, as a family, everyone will be happy. If you are sporty, a diver, a golfer - or if you want to visit one of the leading spas in the world or simply chill out and relax, you can do it all in Soma Bay. Holiday Designers (020 3384 0023; www.holiday-designers.com) offers seven-night breaks at the Kempinski Hotel Soma Bay. Breaks in Laguna Club Rooms cost from £830 per person, for stays before 31 October 2015, if booked by 31 January 2015. The price include return flights, airport tax, 20kg baggage per person, private transfers and airport meet-and-greet service.

"Grandmother Dorothy Flannagan, 86, left alone while her daughter was on holiday died from food poisoning after eating an undercooked chicken kiev (file photo) A pensioner left on her own while her daughter was away on holiday died after contracting food poisoning from an undercooked chicken kiev. Dorothy Flannagan cooked herself a meal after she had food delivered to her home by a Tesco van. But the 86-year-old grandmother started to suffer from sickness and diarrhoea the following day. Doctors believed Mrs Flannagan's organs started to fail after she contracted campylobacter – the most common cause of food poisoning. Tragically the retired club secretary died at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire on July 30. Mrs Flannagan, who lived with her daughter Karen Kelly in Lightwood, Stoke-on-Trent, ordered a food delivery after her daughter went on holiday to Egypt in July last year. Her other daughter Beverley Turner told an inquest in Stoke the delivery included two packets of pre-packed chicken kiev. Mrs Turner, of Caverswall, Staffs, said: 'She had lived with my sister for 18 years. She was self-caring. She didn't need caring for but she had people staying with her while Karen was away. 'Nobody was with mum when she cooked her tea that night. She had previously cooked one in the microwave but I don't know how she cooked it that night. She had already had the chicken kiev when we got there that night. In the UK, it is the most common bacterial cause of food poisoning. Campylobacter bacteria are usually found on raw or undercooked meat (particularly poultry), unpasteurised milk, untreated water, chicken liver and liver pâté. The time between eating contaminated food and the onset of symptoms for food poisoning caused by campylobacter is two to five days. Source: NHS . 'The following day she became unwell. She had no energy and she wasn't making any sense.' Medics initially put Mrs Flannagan's symptoms down to her diabetes and discharged her later that day. But she was re-admitted to hospital the next day after her condition deteriorated. Mrs Turner added: 'She was moved to a different ward where doctors told us that mum had campylobacter, which is highly associated with food poisoning, especially with chicken.' A post mortem revealed the cause of death was acute kidney injury following campylobacter infection. North Staffordshire's assistant coroner Margaret Jones recorded a conclusion of misadventure. She said: 'She was living with her daughter but was able to cook for herself. While her daughter was away Mrs Flannagan cooked some chicken kiev. Mrs Flannagan suffered from sickness, diarrhoea and her organs started to fail after contracting campylobacter, the most common cause of food poisoning. The retired club secretary died at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire (above) on July 30 . 'We know she had previously cooked this in a microwave and we know she had two lots of chicken in the house, but she had consumed only one. 'She was very much under the watchful eye of all of her family and in a short space of time she became very unwell indeed. She was admitted to hospital and her illness was diagnosed. It was a particular bacteria associated with food poisoning.' The assistant coroner added: 'Mrs Flannagan cooked the chicken and she had probably not cooked it as well as she could have, but she cooked it herself and it's highly likely that these two things are very much related.'","Dorothy Flannagan, 86, from Stoke-on-Trent cooked a meal after she had food delivered by a Tesco van .

"John Boehner created the first live-action high drama on the House floor Wednesday, staking out a no-compromise position on blocking Barack Obama's sweeping immigration plan and reading aloud 22 examples of the president's past claims that he lacked the authority to put it into action. Obama outlined the plan on Nov. 20, promising to mainstream 5 million or more illegal immigrants by guaranteeing – without input from Congress – that they won't be deported during his time in office. Angering Democrats, the House speaker spoke during a floor debate to defend an amendment to the Homeland Security Department's budget bill that would forbid the cabinet agency from spending any money to implement it. Boehner openly mocked Obama for what he said was an effort to evade the U.S. Constitution, throwing in his face his past claims that he wasn't a 'king' or an 'emperor.' The Constitution explicitly gives Congress the power to control America's immigration policies. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . IN YOUR FACE: Boehner took Obama to the woodshed on Wednesday over immigration, reading aloud nearly two dozen Obama quotations that indicate the White House can't act unilaterally . NO COMPROMISE: Boehner didn't buy what the president was selling on Tuesday during a high-stakes White House meeting with all of Congress's top leaders . ''To think that the president of the United States studied constitutional law!' he boomed. 'He didn't just learn constitutional law. He taught it himself.' 'Enough is enough!' The move came less than 24 hours after Boehner and other Capitol Hill leaders met with Obama in the White House to air their differences over legislation that would likely make up the bulk of congressional business for in the coming months. On Wednesday, Boehner was in no mood to compromise. Obama's unilateral move, he said, is an 'executive overreach ... an affront to the rule of law and to the Constitution itself.' 'What we are dealing with here is a president who has ignored the people, ignored the Constitution, and even his own past statements,' he said. 'In fact, on at  least 22 occasions he has said he does not have the authority to do what he did.' And then Boehner read them. Obama, he recalled, told an El Paso, Texas audience in May 2011 that immigrants'-rights activists 'wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that’s not how a democracy works.' The president also insisted in an October 2010 interview with the Spanish-language Univision TV network that 'I am president; I am not king. I can't do these things just by myself. … I can't just make the laws up by myself.' In an online Q-and-A session held in September 2011, Obama told viewers: 'We live in a democracy. You have to pass bills through the legislature, and then I can sign it.' He doubled down in a February 2013 Google+ 'hangout' video livestream, saying he was limited in his authority because 'I’m the president of the United States; I'm not the emperor of the United States.' Democrats demanded a roll-call vote on the amendment following Boehner's litany, after hammering Republicans for being 'anti-immigrant' and 'heartless.' The amendment passed by a vote of 237 to 190. Another amendment aimed at ending the president's 'Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals' (DACA) program also passed, 218-209. DACA is a 2012 program that gives sanctuary to illegal immigrants who weer brought to the U.S> as children. The overall DHS funding bill also passed, by a 236-191 margin. Matt Wolking, a communications advisor to the speaker, told DailyMail.com that Obama has 'said over and over that he did not have the authority to do what he eventually did. So his unilateral action sets a very troubling precedent, and not just on immigration. That’s what the Speaker wanted to drive home.' But New York Democrat Carolyn Maloney insisted that the 'Take Care clause' in the Constitution – which demands that the president 'shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed' – gives Obama the power to decide which illegal immigrants are deported and which are allowed to stay. She accused the GOP of 'play[ing] politics with the security and safety of America.' Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee went further, calling the Republican amendment 'a full-force assault on immigrants' and described it as 'Homeland Security being held hostage.' 'A FULL-FORCE ASSAULT ON IMMIGRANTS': Texas Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee slammed the GOP's plan, arguing that they were trying to hold the Homeland Security budget 'hostage . SHOWDOWN: Boehner and House Republicans aim to force Obama into a take-it-or-leave-it veto position on the Homeland Security Department's budget for the rest of the year . The tension will reach its climax in coming weeks when a Homeland Security budget reaches Obama's desk. The White House has a veto of any plan that hamstrings him on immigration, and most Democrats will support him. That sets up the possibility of a Homeland Security 'shutdown' after its funding runs out on February 27. Democrats claim a shutdown would jeopardize national security in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in France, an attack for which al-Qaeda in Yemen claimed responsibility on Wednesday. But if the last partial shutdown is any indication, critical agencies and services wouldn't be affected. The budget bill, including the amendment, still has to go through the U.S. Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised the new Democratic minority that they will be permitted to propose their own amendments. Any differences between the resulting House and Senate bills will have to be ironed out in a conference committee – a uniquely American device that puts leaders from both parties and both houses in the same room to resolve them.","House speaker mocks Obama for going outside the US Constitution after teaching constitutional law .

"Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told attendees of a New Hampshire meet and greet this morning that 'over half the people on disability' are undeserving and are 'gaming the system.' The 2016 presidential hopeful made the remarks while speaking at a breakfast for legislative leaders at Murphy's Diner in Manchester that was open to the press. His speech was videotaped by a Democratic tracker, and an excerpt containing the remarks on persons claiming to be disabled was posted to YouTube. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts,' Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a 2016 presidential hopeful, told a group of state legislators at Murphy's Diner in Manchester, New Hampshire this morning after inferring that those sort of people are 'gaming the system' In the short clip, circulated by the Democratic National Committee, Paul can be seen saying, 'You know the thing is is that all of these programs, there's always somebody who's deserving, and everybody in this room knows somebody who's gaming the system. 'And what I tell people is, if you look like me, and you hop out of your truck, you shouldn't be getting a disability check,' he said. Continuing, Paul told the small group that had gathered to hear him speak, 'Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts. 'Join the club,' he added, eliciting laughter from his audience. 'You know, who doesn't get up a little anxious for work and their back hurts. Everybody over 40 has a back pain.' In an email sent to reporters the DNC said Paul's comments were 'eerily reminiscent of Mitt Romney’s infamous 2012 “47 percent” remarks.' The incident is widely credited with tanking the Republican presidential nominee's odds of beating President Barack Obama in the general election. While speaking at a private fundraiser, Romney claimed that 'there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what...who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.' Romney did not know he was being videotaped. Members of the media were invited to attend Paul's event in New Hampshire today. DNC spokesman Mo Elleithee told The Courier-Journal that Paul's comments are 'insulting to millions of Americans with disabilities.' 'They want leaders who will help them get a fair shot, not condescend to them or accuse them of gaming the system,' Elleithee said. 'Rand Paul has again proven he's not a new type of Republican - when it comes to helping expand opportunity, he's no better than Mitt Romney.' Paul did not back away from his earlier remarks in a statement provided to DailyMail.com on Wednesday afternoon. 'We absolutely should take care of those truly in need of help,' Paul said. 'But the system is broken, and when people can game the system, they are stealing from those who are truly disabled and won't receive the care and aid they need. 'We must reform the system to ensure that those who really need help receive it.' The Kentucky senator is in New Hampshire today meeting with various local activists, business owners and politicians while his colleagues in the Senate travel to to Hershey, Pennsylvania, for a party pow wow. They'll be joined at the retreat by House Republicans later this afternoon. Throughout the past several months Paul has added seasoned operatives to his political action committee all while playing coy about his 2016 plans. Paul has not formally announced a presidential campaign but his hiring of a campaign manager on Tuesday signaled his intentions, and an official campaign launch is expected to come in the spring.","'There's always somebody who's deserving, and everybody in this room knows somebody who's gaming the system,' Paul said .

"A new wandering wolf has been spotted in Oregon hot the paws of the famed OR-7, who fathered pups last summer. The sighting, in woodland close to the rural community of Keno, confirms that wolves are now starting to repopulate the area after being wiped out completely in the mid-1940s through a centuries-long eradication campaign. Biologists do not know the sex of the newly-sighted gray wolf but they can tell by the size of its body that it is an adult. New sighting: This January 5, 2015 remote camera photo shows a gray wolf west of Keno, Oregon . It was caught on an automatic wildlife camera on January 5 after tracks were discovered in the snow in December. Commenting on the discovery, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist John Stephenson said: 'I am surprised to see another wolf unrelated to [OR-7's] rogue pack down in that area so soon. 'It does suggest some sort of dispersal corridor [through which] they are making their way over to that part of the state. But we have no way of knowing. 'We have a number of long-distance dispersers out there that aren't collared. 'Even though it appears this one is staying in this area, I don't think we completely know it will stick in that area or keep moving around.' OR-7 became famous around the world after his GPS tracking collar chronicled his travels once he left the Imnaha pack in northeastern Oregon in 2011. Growing population: This remote camera photo taken May 3, 2014 and provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shows the wolf OR-7 in southwest Oregon's Cascade Range . Joining the club: The mammal went on to father two pups, seen here peering out from a den in the Cascade Range east of Medford, Oregon . He meandered across mountains, forests, deserts and highways to the southern Cascades, south into Northern California, and back again before finding a mate last winter and settling down on the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest and having a set of pups. The newly-released blurry photo taken January 5 shows a gray wolf trotting down a gravel road past a stand of tall pine and fir trees. Though it does not show the animal's head, it is clear from the body that it is an adult, Stephenson said. He adds that though it is gray, like OR-7, they know it is not him because his GPS tracking collar showed him far away at the time. Based on the photo, Oregon Fish and Wildlife would establish a new Area of Known Wolf Activity in the area next week, spokeswoman Michelle Dennehy said. Wildlife agencies last week confirmed official pack status on OR-7, his mate and their pups. Depletion: Extermination programs to accommodate the livestock industry drove wolves out of the west coast in the late 1800s and early 1900s (OR-7 pictured) Rob Klavins of the conservation group Oregon Wild said he hoped the state would get ahead of the curve and work to prevent conflicts between the wolves and livestock by working with ranchers to take non-lethal steps to protect their herds grazing in the area. He cited U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics that about 1,000 cattle are lost each week in Oregon to weather, dogs, disease and other causes, while just five have been confirmed killed by wolves each of the last three years. Hugh Charley, past president of the Jackson County Stockmen, grazes cattle each summer in the area west of Keno where the wolf was sighted. Oregon Fish and Wildlife informed him and other ranchers of the wolf sighting last weekend at the group's annual meeting. Though ranchers were not happy to learn another wolf moved into the area, Charley said he expected they would learn to live with them. 'It's not going to go away,' he said of wolves. Extermination programs to accommodate the livestock industry drove wolves out of the west coast in the late 1800s and early 1900s. However, the species has been steadily reintroduced since the 1990s.","The wolf was spotted in woodland close to the rural community of Keno .

"Nasa has warned of an impending asteroid pass - and says it will be the closest until 2027. The asteroid, designated 2004 BL86, will safely pass about three times the distance of Earth to the moon on January 26. It will be the closest by any known space rock this large until asteroid 1999 AN10 flies past Earth in 2027. See the Asteroid's route below . At the time of its closest approach on January 26, the asteroid will be approximately 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Earth. Due to its orbit around the sun, the asteroid is currently only visible by astronomers with large telescopes who are located in the southern hemisphere. But by Jan. 26, the space rock's changing position will make it visible to those in the northern hemisphere. From its reflected brightness, astronomers estimate that the asteroid is about a third of a mile (0.5 kilometers) in size. At the time of its closest approach on January 26, the asteroid will be approximately 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Earth. 'Monday, January 26 will be the closest asteroid 2004 BL86 will get to Earth for at least the next 200 years,' said Don Yeomans, who is retiring as manager of NASA's Near Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, after 16 years in the position. 'And while it poses no threat to Earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more.' One way NASA scientists plan to learn more about 2004 BL86 is to observe it with microwaves. NASA's Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico will attempt to acquire science data and radar-generated images of the asteroid during the days surrounding its closest approach to Earth. 'When we get our radar data back the day after the flyby, we will have the first detailed images,' said radar astronomer Lance Benner of JPL, the principal investigator for the Goldstone radar observations of the asteroid. 'At present, we know almost nothing about the asteroid, so there are bound to be surprises.' Don't Panic! Nasa says 'While it poses no threat to Earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more.' Asteroid 2004 BL86 was initially discovered on Jan. 30, 2004 by a telescope of the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) survey in White Sands, New Mexico. The asteroid is expected to be observable to amateur astronomers with small telescopes and strong binoculars. 'I may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself,' said Yeomans. 'Asteroids are something special. Not only did asteroids provide Earth with the building blocks of life and much of its water, but in the future, they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources. 'They will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system. There is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up.'","2004 BL86 will pass about three times the distance of Earth to the moon .

"Poppi Worthington died in 2012. A senior coroner ordered an inquest into the 13-month-old's death after a hearing in October declared it 'unascertained' A fresh inquest was ordered yesterday into the death of 13-month-old Poppi Worthington. The decision means more than two years of official silence over the case may finally be broken. Poppi died in December 2012 but the public have been told nothing about what happened to her or how social workers and police handled the affair. It follows a seven-minute inquest in October during which Cumbria coroner Ian Smith gave no information about the circumstances leading to the girl’s death. It simply found that her death was ‘unascertained’. Ian Smith, coroner for the south and east district, did not refer to the events leading up to Poppi's death and said the cause could not be ascertained. He said he was 'satisfied' that the findings of a private family court hearing were sufficient. Lawyers representing several newspaper groups - Times Newspapers Ltd, Guardian News & Media and Associated Newspapers Limited - wrote to Her Majesty's Senior Coroner for Cumbria, David Roberts, to argue the inquest was insufficient and therefore unlawful. In a written reply to law firm RPC, Mr Roberts, said: 'My own view is that it would be desirable for a fresh inquest to take place, not least so that conclusions as to how, when and where Poppi Worthington came by her death can be recorded. 'Neither I nor Mr Smith has power to hold a further inquest without the permission of the High Court. However, it is open to me to seek a fiat (order) from the Attorney General to pursue an application under section 13 of the Coroners Act for an Order that a fresh inquest is to be held and I will now be doing so.' There have been two arrests relating to Poppi's death on December 12, 2012, including her father, Paul, 47, who was questioned on suspicion of sexually assaulting her. Cumbria Constabulary has passed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to consider whether any criminal proceedings should be brought. A CPS spokesman said today: 'We have received a file from Cumbria Constabulary on this case and we will be making a decision as soon as is practicably possible.' In a separate development, it can now be reported that Poppi's home town was Barrow-in-Furness. High Court judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson, who has dealt with family proceedings connected to the case, varied a reporting restriction order following legal submissions made on behalf of numerous media companies. Last October - a week after the inquest - Mr Justice Jackson noted there had been 'some concern' about the lack of information available to the public about the death. Explaining why he had not yet made public his own 'fact-finding judgement' on the case given in the family proceedings last March, the judge said: 'As a result of the judgement further police investigations into Poppi's death are now taking place. 'A decision by the Crown Prosecution Service may then follow. 'In the interests of justice it is essential that this process is allowed to take place without interference and that any criminal proceedings are not prejudiced.' He concluded: 'The circumstances of Poppi's death will surely become known to the public in due course but, for the reasons that I have given, limited reporting restrictions remain necessary at this point in time and the fact-finding judgement of this court cannot yet be published.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Poppi Worthington was 13 months old when she died in December 2012 .

"At age 12, Martin Pistorius suddenly turned from a healthy boy obsessed with electronics into a virtual 'vegetable' after falling into an inexplicable comatose state. He would spend the next dozen years trapped inside his weakened, helpless body, unable to speak or move, with only the children's character Barney to keep him company for hours on end. 'I cannot even express to you how much I hated Barney,' Martin recalled on the first episode of NPR's new radio show about human behavior, Invisibilia. Mystery illness: At age 12, Martin Pistorius, pictured here with his father, Rodney, suddenly turned from a healthy boy into a virtual vegetable after falling into an inexplicable comatose state . But according to Martin, it was his burning desire to get away from the affable purple dinosaur prancing with kids on the television screen in a South African clinic that gave him the impetus to get better. In a bid to gain some control of his day, Martin figured a way to tell time by tracking the movement of the sun across the room. Four years into his mystery illness, he started to regain consciousness and mobility, until eventually he learned to operate a computer to type messages and speak through a speech synthesizer. In 2011, Martin wrote a book about his extraordinary journey, which fortunately had a happy end: he met a woman in 2008 and the two got married and moved to the UK a year later. The same year Martin's autobiography, Ghost Boy, was released, he wrote a poignant first-person account for the Daily Mail detailing his illness and remarkable recovery. In January 1988, when Martin Pistorius was 12 years old, he came home from school one day with a sore throat. He never returned to class. Bittersweet memory: Martin, front, with his parents and siblings in the last picture before the illness struck. Doctors were never able to accurately diagnose his condition . Fed up: Martin was stuck in front of a TV set watching reruns of Barney (right) for days on end, until one day he decided he's had enough. He started following the movement of the sun in the room to tell time . Buried alive: Pistorius recalled feeling entombed in his weak, out-of-control body, even as his mind continued to churn out thoughts that he could not communicate . In the months that followed, his condition deteriorated. Doctors were never able to conclusively pinpoint the exact cause of his ailment, but cryptococcal meningitis was the most likely culprit. His mobility was the first to go, followed by his memory, leaving him an empty shell of his old self. ‘My muscles wasted, my limbs became spastic, my hands and feet curled in on themselves like claws,’ he wrote for Daily Mail. ‘I was completely unresponsive. I was in a virtual coma but the doctors couldn’t diagnose what had caused it.’ After months of tests and doctor visits, Martin's parents, Rodney and Joan Pistorius, were told that nothing can be done for him, and that the only option was to put their son in a home and let his degenerative neurological mystery illness run its course. 'Politely but firmly the medical profession washed its hands of me. We were in effect told to wait until my death released us all,' he wrote. In first person: In 2011, Pistorius published his memoir Ghost Boy about his illness and recovery . Speaking to NPR's Invisibilia from his home in Harlow, England, Pistorius said his darkest hour came when his mother entered into his room and told him, 'I hope you die.' Joan Pistorius said she uttered those pitiless words thinking her vegetable-like son could not hear her. But he did. Against all odds, Martin continued living. For the next decade, his father's life consisted of getting up early in the morning, driving his helpless son to a special care center, then picking him up eight hours later and driving him home, where he would be bathed, fed and put to bed. His mother initially wanted nothing to do with Martin, so great was her anger and resentment brought on by seeing her once-healthy boy turn into a 'potted plant.' At one point during those dark days, Joan Pistorius even tried to take her own life by overdosing on pills, but her husband was able to get her to the hospital in time. What Joan and Rodney did not know was that about two years into their son’s ailment, his mind 'switched on.' 'I began to wake up,' Pistorius, now age 39, told NPR, explaining that all of a sudden he was aware of 'everything.' No one around Martin knew that he had regained his mental faculties because he still could not move his body or express himself verbally. He was effectively trapped, and there was no way to escape. In his lengthy account from 2011, Martin wrote: ‘Though my body and I were locked in an endless fight, my mind was getting stronger. Pieces of my consciousness knitted together. ‘I gradually became aware of each day and each hour in it. Most were forgettable but there were times I saw history unfold. Mandela becoming president in 1994 is a hazy memory but Diana’s death in 1997 is clear. ‘I knew who I was and where I was, and understood I’d been robbed of a real life. Love at first smile: In 2008, Pistorius met a social worker named Joanna, who said she was instantly drawn to his sense of humor . ‘I was completely entombed. At first I wanted to fight my fate by leaving some tiny sign to guide people back to me, like the crumbs Hansel and Gretel left to help find their way out of the woods. ‘Have you ever seen one of those movies in which someone wakes up as a ghost but they don’t know that they’ve died? That’s how it was, as I realized people were looking through and around me. ‘However much I tried to beg and plead, shout and scream, I couldn’t make them notice me.’ Martin recalled that while most of the staff at the special care clinic he was in were kind to him, some were callous and cruel, calling him an 'obstacle' and 'rubbish' to his face, not realizing that he could hear and understand ever hurtful word. Martin's first impulse was to turn off his thoughts, since he saw no point in having them in the first place. ‘You don't really think about anything,’ Martin said. ‘You simply exist. It's a very dark place to find yourself because, in a sense, you are allowing yourself to vanish.’ But then something changed inside him. After learning to tell time by the sun just so he could escape the endless Barney reruns on TV, Martin slowly regained his will to live, in part thanks to a kindly special care worker who took a genuine interest in him. At age 26, Martin passed a test by identifying pictures of various items with his eyes. Joan, his mother, quit her job as a radiographer and spent the next two years helping Martin master a computer program that enabled him to communicate. Discover more at GhostBoyBook.com.

Sealed with a kiss: In 2009, the couple got married.Te two are shown here on their wedding day . 'My feeble hands pressing one of my switches enabled me to choose a word I wanted. Then I would click on one last symbol – ‘speak’ – and my electronic voice would have its say,' he wrote in 2011. Still wheelchair-bound and unable to speak normally, Martin went on to get a job at a government office. But he was not done yet. Pistorius then enrolled in a university to study computer science and eventually started his own company. He is now learning to drive. In 2008, Martin's life took yet another sudden turn, only this time for the better: he met a social worker named Joanna. A friend of Martin's sister, Joanna said she was instantly drawn to Martin's sense of humor. For Martin and Joanna, it was love at first smile.

"Malaysian authorities are hunting for a former policeman who is believed to be living in Australia after he had his acquittal over the murder of a model reversed as part of a high-level political corruption scandal. Malaysia's highest court on Tuesday upheld death sentences for two police officers convicted of killing and blowing up Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu, a 28-year-old model and interpreter. Authorities in Malaysia said they will seek the help of the Australian Federal Police to arrest and extradite   one of the policemen, Sirul Azhar Umar, who flew to Australia in October last year. Altantuya Shaariibuu, a 28-year-old model and interpreter, was murdered in Malaysia in 2006 . Ms Shaariibuu was linked to a former associate of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in a sensational scandal involving allegations of high-level corruption that shook the long-ruling regime . Policemen Azilah Hadri and Sirul Azhar Umar, found guilty of her murder, arrive at court  in 2009 . Ms Shaariibuu was murdered in 2006 and was linked to a former associate of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in a sensational scandal involving allegations of high-level corruption that shook the long-ruling regime. The allegations related to massive kickbacks in the $1.1 billion 2002 purchase of French Scorpene submarines. Court testimony stated Ms Shaariibuu, who was involved in negotiations for the submarines, told her killers she was pregnant and begged for her life to be spared before she was shot twice in the head and then blown up with military-grade explosives, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. The remains of Ms Shaariibuu were found in a jungle clearing near Kuala Lumpur. Adding to the intrigue, she was a lover of Abdul Razak Baginda - the man in charge of purchasing the submarines and a close associate of current Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was defence minister at the time of the deal.

A crucifix lies at the crime scene in the forest where Ms Shaariibuu was shot and her corpse blown up . Malaysian security officers carry away one of the policemen (covered face) found guilty of murder in 2009 . Allegations have simmered for years that Ms Shaariibuu was murdered to keep her quiet about purported kickbacks to high-level Malaysian officials. Sirul and the second convicted policeman, Azilah Hadri, were members of an elite unit that guarded top Malaysian ministers and government critics have long alleged that the two men were scapegoats in Ms Shaariibuu's murder. The authoritarian government has long refused calls for a wide-ranging inquiry and the subject is taboo. Both accused deny killing Ms Shaariibuu. Sirul has previously alleged he was being 'sacrificed' to protect others. The Federal Court panel said Tuesday the two officers had both separately led investigators to the site where the body was found, which 'strengthened the case' against them. Allegations have simmered for years that Ms Shaariibuu (pictured outside the Notre-Dame Cathedral) was murdered to keep her quiet about purported kickbacks to high-level Malaysian officials . A shocked-looking Azilah was led out of the courtroom Tuesday after the decision. Sirul's defence team, however, told the court they did not know his whereabouts. An arrest warrant was issued. Kuala Lumpur police chief Mohmad Salleh said Malaysia will liaise with the AFP if Sirul is found to still be in Australia. But the extradition of Sirul would be problematic for Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, should he be located in Australia. Mr Abbott last week said Australia 'opposes the death penalty' when speaking about the case of Bali Nine drug smuggler Myuran Sukumaran, whose appeal against his death sentence has been rejected by Indonesia. Sirul Azhar Umar's lawyer Kamarul Hisham Kamaruddin after the court upheld his death sentence on Tuesday . Sirul is understood to be living in Australia and Malaysian authorities said they will seek to extradite him . Sirul and Azilah were convicted in 2009 and sentenced to hang, but released when an appeals court overturned the conviction in 2013 after raising questions about how their trial was conducted, prompting the prosecution's appeal to the Federal Court. Critics frequently allege government manipulation of sensitive court cases. The case centres on allegations French submarine maker DCNS paid commissions of more than 114 million euros ($142 million) to a shell company linked to Abdul Razak Baginda, who is not related to the premier. Malaysia's opposition claims these were kickbacks. No motive for Ms Shaariibuu's death has ever been revealed. Shaaribuu Setev, father of model and interpreter Altantuya Shaaribuu, pictured in 2008 . French judicial officials, acting on a request by Malaysian human rights group Suaram, opened an investigation in 2010 into the sale. The inquiry is ongoing. Cynthia Gabriel, who runs a Malaysian anti-corruption NGO, welcomed the decision but said too many questions remain unanswered. 'For truth-seeking Malaysians, they want to know the motive for her brutal death and if anyone high up in the political leadership was also involved in the murder,' she said. In 2008, private investigator P. Balasubramaniam implicated several government officials, including Najib, in the murder. He later recanted, saying he was being coerced to keep silent, and fled abroad. Najib has denied any involvement. Balasubramaniam returned in 2013 vowing to expose the truth, but died within two weeks of an apparent heart attack.

"A white Islamic militant who christened herself 'Jihad Jane' and was convicted of plotting to kill a cartoonist who satirized the Prophet Muhammad, has claimed her actions were motivated our of love. Colleen LaRose, 51, of Pennsberg, Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty to charges including planning a jihad and conspiring to kill Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks in 2011 and was convicted in 2014. She was sentenced to ten years in prison, but in a recent letter to a criminologist, LaRose said love was behind her crimes. Writing from prison, Colleen LaRose, 51, who admitted conspiring to kill Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks in 2011, has said that her actions were taken out of love for the Prophet Muhammad . LaRose wrote in response to a query from Kimberly Mehlman-Orozco, who shared the letter with NBC News. 'Why did I do what I was convicted of?' she wrote. 'There's many reasons but the simplest reason is I did it for love. 'Love for my Prophet, love for my Ummah [community] and love for the brother that gave me the assignment. 'Also I think I did it for pride. Sisters are never given assignments like the one I was given. I felt my brother had enough confidence and trust in me that he honored me by giving me the assignment. I felt if he loved me that much then I had to do what he told me needed to be done.' Mehlman-Orozco wrote to LaRose months before last week's terrorist attack on the Paris office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo after it had published cartoons of Muhammad. The criminologist wrote to several people convicted in the U.S. of terrorist-related crimes. Raped as a child, LaRose ran away from home to become a prostitute at 13 and fell into militant Islam for a 'sense of belonging'. In 2011 she admitted to plotting to kill Lars Vilks, right . She has since begun correspondences with LaRose and Richard Reid, the British national serving life for trying to blow up a plane with a shoe-bomb in 2001. Mehlman-Orozco plans to ask both of them for their views on the bloodshed in Paris. 'I think there is some value in understanding how they perceive it,' she told NBC. Ultimately she plans to turn the letters into a book. LaRose admitted to plotting to kill Lars Vilks, an artist who drew Muhammad's face on a dog's head in a cartoon, outraging many Muslims. Raped as a child, she ran away from home to become a prostitute at 13. She told Reuters in 2013 that militant Islam gave her a 'place where I belonged.' 'When I found out about Islam I thought this is what I have to do, this is why I've lived so long.' LaRose also explained the difficulties of her early life in Detroit, Michigan, leaving her as emotionally vulnerable adult. At around eight years old LaRose, and her older sister Pat, was raped by her father Richard LaRose. The sexual abuse continued until LaRose ran away from at 13. The girl then worked in prostitution and developed heroin and cocaine addictions. At 16, LaRose married a man twice her age, but just a year later she turned up at a shelter for teens in Memphis and was committed to a psychiatric facility for several months. While at this shelter she worked with counselor Ollie Avery Mannino. When Mannino rang Richard LaRose to check Colleen's story, her father answered with hesitation: 'Yeah. I raped her.' As Reuters journalist John Shiffman, who spent six months investigating the case, wrote: 'He said it sharply, without remorse, and in such a prideful, guttural tone that Mannino snapped her head, stunned.' Richard LaRose died in 2010, having never been prosecuted for his crimes. Collen LaRose continued to drift, split from her first husband, and married again at 23. This relationship ended in divorce 11 years later. LaRose became radicalized after converting to Islam in 2007 and posted under the name Jihad Jane on militant Islamic websites . LaRose claims that her father's abuse ruined her life: 'I have done all kinds of bad things. I was rebelling because of what he did and because my mother did nothing to help us.' LaRose became radicalized and posted under the name Jihad Jane on militant Islamic websites. When Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks portrayed the Prophet Muhammed with the body of a dog in 2007 put a £67,000 bounty on the head of the artist. In constant contact with al-Qaida operatives around the world, LaRose swore to travel to Europe and kill Vilks. According to her indictment, she wrote: 'I will make this my goal till I achieve it or die trying.' LaRose recruited other Americans, such as Jamie Paulin-Ramirez of Colorado and Mohammad Hassan Khalid of Maryland to her jihad cause. She got to Sweden in 2009 but was arrested by the FBI on her return to the U.S. While LaRose claims she got close to killing Vilks and achieving martyrdom, John Schiffman of Reuters claims: 'In truth, what happened proved more farcical than frightful, more absurd than ominous.'","Colleen LaRose, 51, of Pennsberg, Pennsylvania, is serving time for planning a jihad and conspiring to kill Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks .

"Just days after rumours of a speech translation tool surfaced, Google has officially launched the feature as part of its Translate app. Both iOS and Android users can now talk to the app and get a written translation of what they're saying, in real time, on the screen. The move builds on Google's current tools, which offer written translation of 90 languages, as well  spoken translations in a select number of languages on Android devices. Users can now talk to the Google Translate app and get a written translation of what they're saying, in real time, on the screen (pictured). The update will begin rolling out to both iOS and Android users from today . 'Often the hardest part of travelling is navigating the local language,' said Barak Turovsky, product lead for Google Translate. 'Now Google Translate can be your guide in new ways. Asking for directions to the Rive Gauche, ordering bacalhau in Lisbon, or chatting with your grandmother in her native Spanish just got a lot faster.' The update will begin rolling out to both iOS and Android users from today. When using the app, tap the mic to enter the voice translation mode. Tap the mic again, and the Google Translate app will automatically recognise which language is being spoken by both members of the conversation. Word Lens uses augmented reality to translate text including road signs, menus, newspapers, and more by pointing a phone’s camera towards it. Supported languages include Russian, Spanish, French, Italian, German and Portuguese. Google bought the technology by acquiring California-based developers Quest Visual in May last year. Available on iOS, Android and Google Glass, users choose the language they want to translate to and from, before holding a camera up to text, such as a road sign or menu. Word Lens automatically translates the text and overlays it on the same image on the phone's display. As part of the latest app update, this feature now works without a data connection. Once the two languages have been recognised, the app will be poised to translate speech, meaning the user doesn't need to press the mic button again. Google has also updated its Translate app's Word Lens tool. Word Lens lets people use camera mode to take a photo of text and get a translation in 36 languages. Now, while using the Translate app, users can point their camera at a sign or text and see the translated text overlaid the screen - even if they don't have a data connection. This instant translation currently works for translation from English to and from French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish, and Google said it is working to expand to more languages. 'More than 500 million people use Google Translate every month, making more than 1 billion translations a day to more easily communicate and access information across languages,' continued Mr Turovsky. 'Today’s updates take us one step closer to turning your phone into a universal translator and to a world where language is no longer a barrier to discovering information or connecting with each other.' An insider leaked details of these changes to the New York Times earlier this week. The app has also updated its Word Lens tool.

It lets people of different languages talk to each other on video calls. The software translates Spanish or English into text and speech, using a Windows 8.1 device . Last month, Microsoft's Skype released a beta version of its own live translation tool, which translates speech instantly into both text and spoken translations. While it currently only interprets between English and Spanish, it will eventually offer 40 languages, which will mean people from different countries will be able to converse with ease. ‘Skype is now removing another barrier to make it possible for people to communicate irrespective of what language they speak,’ Microsoft’s Gurdeep Pall wrote in a blog post at the time. ‘Skype Translator relies on machine learning, which means that the more the technology is used, the smarter it gets.’ Microsoft first unveiled the technology (pictured) two years ago. At the time, though, it was deemed too inaccurate to release to the general public. But a breakthrough by the Skype and Microsoft Translator teams in neural network-based speech recognition reduced errors in speech recognition by more than 30 per cent .","App now automatically recognises speech in a range of languages .

"A mother-of-two whose husband tried to burn her alive in front of their children before torching himself has spoken for the first time about her horrific ordeal. Lisa Franklin, 42, from Dudley, in the West Midlands, was lucky to escape with her life after her husband Brian, who had abused her for years, doused her in petrol and tried to set her on fire after locking their two sons in the family car just feet away. When she escaped, he shut himself in their home and set it ablaze - as his wife and two boys, aged 15 and 10, watched on in horror. The couple met in 2000, married in 2003 and soon after Mrs Franklin fell pregnant with their son Brandon . Now brave Mrs Franklin is speaking out about her experiences as she wants to warn others about the horrors of domestic abuse. She said: 'Brian tried to tear apart our family when he burned down our home but we are stronger than ever and looking forward to a bright future. 'He had been abusing me for years, but one day he really just flipped. 'I honestly thought I was going to die and I was terrified for myself and for my boys. 'It's unbelievable that it was just a few months ago, but we are finally beginning to move on with our lives.' A room in the house after the fire - Mrs Franklin says she and her children lost everything . Some of the damage caused in the fire at the family home which cost Brian Franklin his life . The couple met in 2000, married in 2003 and soon after Mrs Franklin fell pregnant with their son Brandon. Mrs Franklin said: 'We lived a completely ordinary life. I had a new baby and Brian worked as a mechanic. 'He had a good side to him. He would help anyone he could.' But slowly Brian started to change. In 2009 he became stricter with the children and had violent mood swings. 'He smashed glasses or threw things around, and then one day, he started laying into me,' Mrs Franklin said. 'And he wasn't just physically violent. He became possessive and controlling. 'Dinner had to be on the table at a certain time and I needed his permission for everything. 'But I got so used to it I thought it was a normal life. 'I thought about leaving him before and we split briefly a couple of times. Lisa Franklin was lucky to escape with her life after her husband Brian, who had abused her for years, doused her in petrol and tried to set her on fire . 'I took the kids to my parents' but he always turned up a few days later with flowers and apologies and so I took him back.' Brian's anger came to a head in February last year. Mrs Franklin came home and he started shouting that she was putting her job as a care co-ordinator before the family. Mrs Franklin said: 'I thought it was just another one of his rants and I turned away but before I knew it he was dragging me across the kitchen by my hair. 'I was screaming at my youngest son to call the police and then the next thing I knew he was cutting off chunks of my hair with a knife, slashing my wrists and pushing me out the front door. The police arrested Brian and told him not to contact the family but less than a week later, he sneaked into the house. 'He crept up behind me and said he was ending it and he taking me with him, and then screamed at the boys to leave and get in the car,' said Mrs Franklin. 'That was when he started throwing the petrol all over me, in my hair and clothes and mouth, and I knew this was my last chance to escape. 'I managed to push him away, yanked at the door and ran straight into a neighbour's house screaming to call the police.' In his bid to chase Mrs Franklin down, Brian tripped and she got away. As he clambered up, their sons, trapped in the car, saw him shut the door behind him and then an explosion of light filled the front room. Their sons, trapped in the car, saw Franklin shut the front door and 'an explosion of light' filled the front room . An inquest determined that Brian, after entering their house with an air rifle and a petrol can, had tried to kill himself when he set the fire. In the aftermath, Mrs Franklin and her sons moved in with her brother and tried to piece their lives back together. Mrs Franklin said: 'I couldn't believe what had happened had happened to me - my family, my husband, my house. 'It only sank in when I when my brother took me to get some essentials at our local shopping centre and I saw someone I knew. 'I hid my face because I was so ashamed to have to explain what had happened. Mrs Franklln and her sons have moved - she says they are finally 'free' from her violent husband . 'Slowly we began to rebuild our lives. The boys went back to school and six weeks after the fire, we were allowed back into the house. 'I took one step over the threshold but couldn't make it any further and my best friend and the fire investigation team tried to salvage anything that was left. 'The downstairs was completely destroyed. Where our big sofa was, there was just one spring left on the floor. 'The kids lost everything.' But with the support of her family, Mrs Franklin and the boys have made it out the other side of their year of tragedy. Mrs Franklin said: 'My son Brandon and I have always been close but since the fire, we have a new bond. 'I think he's come out of himself now that Brian's controlling oppressive force isn't there. 'They're both finally being allowed to be free. The house the Franklins lived in before the fire - an inquest determined that Brian clearly tried to kill himself . 'For me, it's like a new lease of life. I feel like I'm 20 again. The fear has gone. 'I don't know why I didn't do something to end the abuse earlier. 'I think it's because I've always been a really a strong person and I didn't want to tell people that I was actually weak in some way. 'And I was scared about what he might do. He weighed 18 stone and if he wanted he could really do some damage. 'That's why I want to speak out now. People need to know that they can do something and there is help out there for anyone in an abusive relationship. 'There is light at the end of the tunnel.'","Lisa Franklin narrowly escaped being set alight by violent husband Brian .

"A bride-to-be who lost her fiancé in a Christmas Day car crash said a tearful farewell to him as she buried him in his wedding suit. Debbie Smyth joined hundreds of mourners at the funeral of Mark Price, 51, her partner of nine years who she was due to marry on Saturday. Before the  service, Ms Smyth said: 'My heart is broken and I can’t stop crying. We were so excited about the wedding. It was going to be such a special day. Now I’ve decided to bury him in his wedding suit. It seems fitting, at least he’ll get to wear it.' Mark Price, pictured, was killed in a head-on collision on Christmas Day near his home in Leicestershire . Mr Price was driving along the A606 in Leicestershire in his Toyota Auris when it collided with a Ford C-Max driven by Lynda Anne Wade, 48 at 8.50 on Christmas morning. Unfortunately both Mr Price and Ms Wade were killed at the scene. Mr Price and Ms Smyth were due to be married on Saturday. Paying tribute to her partner, Ms Smyth said: 'He had a heart of gold and would do anything for anybody. I lost my brother, aged 50, to a heart attack a few years ago. We were so shocked by the suddenness and from then on decided to live life to the full.' Mr Price's friend Malcolm Brown said: 'Mark and Debbie missed the wedding, the honeymoon and a life together. Mark just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time – a Sliding Doors moment.' Mr Price and Debbie Smyth met while working in Loughborough University, Leicestershire, pictured . The thanksgiving service, followed by a private burial, was held at their village’s Anglican parish church of St Mary and St John – less than a mile from Rothley Court Hotel where the couple had been due to marry in three days. The couple had enjoyed a Midnight service at the church on Christmas Eve. The Rev. Gladstone said: 'I shook hands with him in this church a few hours before he tragically died. He was looking forward to celebrating Christmas and his marriage to Debbie.' The couple met while working in Loughborough University and had recently moved into their dream cottage.","Mark Price was killed in a head-on collision on Christmas morning .

"They say lightning doesn't strike twice but among some gullible Chelsea fans that phrase doesn't appear to apply. A year ago talkSPORT, managed to dupe some Blues supporters into believing that their club was linked with various players during the January transfer window - only for those names to be made up.And 12 months on, the radio station has been at it again outside Stamford Bridge - with the theme being of Star Wars characters this time around dubbed as 'Transfer Wars'. VIDEO Scroll down to see Chelsea fans fooled in Star Wars transfer target prank . Chelsea fans were duped into believing that players based on Star Wars characters were transfer targets . TalkSPORT dubbed the video 'Transfer Wars' in relation to the sci-fi franchise theme . Keen to prove their unrelenting passion for the club though, fans claim to have seen 'trio' JJ Binks (Jar Jar Binks), Artur Detur (R2-D2) and Stew Bacca (Chewbacca) - with all three reported welcome additions to Jose Mourinho's squad. Binks, a centre back or a left winger from the MLS, is described by one fan as the 'new John Terry,' while another says he will be a good signing on the flanks. Bacca is mentioned to play in the similar mould of his older 'brother' Carlos - the Sevilla and Colombia international striker. Unlike his 28-year-old 'sibling' though, Bacca's main 'attributes' are his ability to play as a target man. The 6ft 5in forward would be a welcome addition according to the Blues faithful and is seen as an ideal replacement for club legend Didier Drogba. 'Stew Bacca' was seen by fans as an ideal replacement for club legend Didier Drogba . 'Artur Detur' like JJ Binks is another young prospect who can play both as a centre back or as a left winger . Detur, like Binks, has the rare tactical flexibility to play in the heart of defence and or on the left flank - a trait that Chelsea supporters clearly feel would be a bonus commodity. The France star's potential arrival is one relished by the west London faithful, although one fan believes he needs another season before he can make a real impact at the club. Although the force is not with all Chelsea supporters, two were switched on to the prank. Upon hearing of Binks a male duo state that they have 'never heard of him,' before querying that the MLS prospect 'sounds like something out of Star Wars.' The duo's suspicions are confirmed upon hearing Detur's name but alas if only their fellow supporters were as clued up. The prank didn't fool these two Chelsea fans (centre and right) though who were wise to the made-up names . Luckily for them though there's no pulling the wool the eyes over Mourinho's side at present it seems, as the Blues continue to fight on all four fronts for silverware this season. Saturday's 2-0 win at home to Newcastle saw the Blues move two points clear of title rivals Manchester City at the top of the Premier League.

"Many of us have been forced to tighten our belts in recent times. And it seems the squeeze has finally become too much even for David Cameron. Speculation that fresh cuts have been implemented in the prime ministerial wardrobe emerged after a tailor whose bespoke suits cost around £2,000 was photographed entering No10. Geoffrey Golding, 70, whose customers also include the Duke of York, had an 8am appointment and was seen entering with a tape measure around his neck and a suit bag draped over one arm. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron announced he was on a post-Christmas diet sparking speculation that Mr Golding had been called in to alter the waistline of the PM'S suits . Later the same day Mr Cameron announced he had given up bread and snacks as part of ‘a great patriotic struggle’ to lose weight, prompting speculation that Mr Golding had been called in to alter the waistline of the Prime Minister’s suits. The tailor, the grandson of Russian Jewish immigrants who settled in the East End of London, opened his first shop in St Albans, Hertfordshire, at the age of 19 in 1963. His workshop was awarded the Queen’s Royal Warrant for services to the Royal Household in 2001. Prince Andrew has been a customer for two decades and Mr Golding has fitted diplomats, military officers and business leaders. His presence at No10 also sheds new light on Mr Cameron’s preferred outfitters. It was previously known that he wears suits from the Savile Row tailor Richard James, which can cost up to £3,500. In contrast, Ed Miliband reportedly favours ready-to-wear suits from British tailor Hackett, which cost around £600, while Nick Clegg sports suits from designer Paul Smith, with prices starting at £615.

"A former Massachusetts prosecutor says actor Mark Wahlberg should not be pardoned for a 1988 assault of two Vietnamese men because he has never acknowledged the crime was racist. Wahlberg filed an appeal with the Massachusetts Parole Board in December asking them to pardon him of a 1988 conviction for assault which saw him jailed for three months. The Oscar-tipped performer claims he is a different person from the man that committed the attack 26 years ago, and has tried to make up for his actions in later life. However Judith Beals, a former state prosecutor who led a case against Wahlberg for hurling stones and racial slurs at black children two years earlier, says the appeal should be turned down. Scroll down for video . Forgiveness: Actor Mark Wahlberg has asked the Massachusetts Parole Board to pardon him for a 1988 conviction for assault after he hit two Vietnamese men and tried to rob an alcohol store . Ms Beals said today that she believes in 'forgiveness and reconciliation', but that Wahlberg has yet to acknowledge the racial element of his crimes, which she says should be the key to a pardon. The case against Wahlberg began in 1986, when he and two white friends were caught chasing three black siblings in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, throwing rocks and yelling racial slurs. The following day, Wahlberg and a larger group of white friends harassed a group of mostly black fourth-graders until an ambulance driver intervened. Ms Beals helped to prosecute the case against Wahlberg, then aged 14, and he was issued with an order which would allow for a criminal conviction in the event he committed another racially motivated offence. Two years later, in 1988, Wahlberg was back in court again, this time charged with hitting a Vietnamese man in the head with a stick while trying to steal alcohol from a convenience store. Court papers filed at the time say Wahlberg hit one man, named Thanh Lam, over the head with a five-foot wooden pole while yelling 'Vietnam f****** s***'. Denied: Judith Beals, who lead a case against Wahlberg for hurling stone and racial slurs at black children in 1986, says the appeal should be denied because he has never accepted his crimes were racist . Wahlberg went on the run from the crime scene, and before he was caught by police he punched another Vietnamese man, named Johnny Trinh, in the face. After he was arrested Wahlberg made references to 'slant-eyed g***s' in front of police. His previous court order was triggered, and he ended up being convicted as an adult and sentenced to three months in jail. He was released after about 45 days. He is now seeking a pardon for that conviction, saying he accepts he was high on marijuana and other drugs at the time, and has tried to become a better person as an adult. In an interview in December, the now 43-year-old said: 'I've been looking for redemption (since) the day I woke up and realized that I done some horrific things and was on a path of self-destruction, as well as causing a lot of people harm. 'When I decided to petition for a pardon, it wasn't based on the things I accomplished in my career. 'It's been the things I've been able to do in my personal life: giving back to the community and helping kids, especially inner-city kids and at-risk youth and kids growing up in that same situation.' However, Ms Beals pointed out that this apology does not acknowledge the racial element of the crimes, and therefore does not go far enough. Wahlberg (left) was 16 when he hit Vietnamese man Johnny Trinh (right) and another shop owner while making references to 'slant eyed g***s' Beals added that Wahlberg's status and wealth should not place him in a better position than others to erase his misdeeds. She also said that hate crimes should be held to a higher standard. Representatives for Wahlberg, who stars in new film The Gambler and also appeared in 'Boogie Nights' and 'Lone Survivor,' were not available for comment at the time of publishing. The state parole board has to hold a hearing on the request by Wahlberg and send a recommendation to the governor, who will decide whether to issue a pardon. Final say then rests with the Governor's Council, an elected body. Governors generally don't make pardon decisions until they're leaving office. Former Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, issued just four in the final days of his eight-year tenure. His predecessor, Mitt Romney, a Republican, never issued one. Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, took office this month.","Wahlberg convicted for 1988 attack on two Vietnamese men in Boston .

"President Francois Hollande has announced the deployment of the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle to the Middle East to join in attacks against ISIS forces in Iraq. The nuclear-powered vessel will travel to the Gulf with its battle group where it will be in position to attack ISIS targets in Iraq with its complement of 20 combat aircraft. Speaking today on the vessel, which is the flagship of the French navy, President Hollande said the current situation 'justifies the presence of our aircraft carrier'.

President Hollande said the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, pictured, would join strikes against ISIS in Iraq . President Hollande, pictured, announced that he was reviewing cuts to France's military spending . The deployment will take place as part of the multi-national operation 'Inherent Resolve'. President Hollande told personnel on board the aircraft carrier: 'Thanks to the Charles de Gaulle we will have precious intelligence.' France was the first country to join the United States in attacking ISIS although it has ruled out launching strikes in Syrian territory. It has about 800 military personnel, nine fighter jets, a maritime patrol aircraft and a refueling plane at its base in the United Arab Emirates as part of its 'Chammal' Iraq mission, as well as an anti-aircraft warship in the Gulf. It also operates six Mirage fighter jets from Jordan. France also has more than 3,000 troops carrying out counter-insurgency operations against al Qaeda-linked militants in the Sahel-Sahara region. It has urged African nations to step up cross-border cooperation to tackle security challenges from Islamist groups in southern Libya to Boko Haram attacks in Nigeria as it seeks to scale back its military commitments on the continent.

Hollande reaffirmed that France would reduce the number of troops deployed in the Central African Republic, where it has handed control of peacekeeping operations to United Nations missions. France had deployed 2,000 troops to curb Christian-Muslim violence in the country. This will fall to 800 by the autumn. A week after Islamist militants carried out a series of attacks in Paris, killing 17 people, Hollande said 10,500 military personnel would be deployed across France as of Wednesday evening to bolster domestic security. The president added that the government needed to review the rate of cuts to French military personnel planned over the next three years to take account of security needs.

"One in five cancers is not diagnosed until patients turn up at A&E – dramatically slashing their chances of survival. Much of the reason for the shocking figure is that many people do not know the signs to look out for, so have no idea anything is wrong until the situation is so bad they need emergency help. But GPs have also been criticised for not spotting the signs early enough. One in five cancers is not diagnosed until patients turn up at A&E – dramatically slashing their chances of survival (file picture) Patients who do not find out they have cancer until they see a doctor in a casualty department are twice as likely to die within a year than those referred by their GP – because their disease tends to be more advanced. There is a dangerous postcode lottery – with 30 per cent of cancers diagnosed in A&E in the worst areas. In the best areas, just 13 per cent of cancers are diagnosed in this way. The National Audit Office report said: ‘About one in five people are still diagnosed either in an A&E department or following an emergency admission to hospital, rather than via a routine screening or GP referral to hospital. ‘Those diagnosed via emergency presentation are, on average, around twice as likely to die within a year of diagnosis as those diagnosed via an urgent GP referral, because their cancers are generally more advanced. Those diagnosed at A&E with cancer are twice as likely to die within a year than those referred by their GP . ‘More research is needed to understand better how many emergency presentations are avoidable and how they can be avoided.’ Figures quoted in the report show that the percentage of cancers diagnosed through emergency presentations decreased from 23.7 per cent in the first half of 2009 to 20.6 per cent in the second half of 2012. ‘In 2012, the percentage of cancers diagnosed through emergency presentation varied from 13 per cent to 30 per cent across the 211 clinical commissioning groups,’ it said. ‘Between 2009 and 2012 the gap between the clinical commissioning groups with the highest (top 10 per cent) and lowest (bottom 10 per cent) percentage of cancers diagnosed through emergency presentations decreased by 1.6 percentage points.’","Patients twice as likely to die within a year if diagnosed with cancer at A&E .

As the standoff continued, police attempted to negotiate with the brothers but were told: ‘We are ready to die as martyrs’ The extremists were on the run until they were gunned down at the industrial estate in Dammartin, which is near Charles de Gaulle Airport. On the day of they were shot dead, the brothers managed to evade the huge police dragnet and hijacked a grey Peugeot 206 being driven by a woman teacher near Montagny-Sainte-Felicite, 30 miles north-east of Paris. The teacher was freed unhurt soon afterwards, then dozens of police cars began chasing the fugitives along the N2 highway towards Paris. During the chase, shots were exchanged. The brothers dumped their car and fled on foot to the family-run printing company, 19 miles north east of Paris. They burst into the business – posing as armed police – and took the company’s boss hostage. Graphic designer Lilian Lepere, 27, who was inside the building, hid in a cardboard box and sent text messages to police after realising the Charlie Hebdo killers were hiding out in his office. The killers were unaware that commandos were being tipped off about their every move. For more than six hours the graphic designer passed on crucial information. Armed police surrounded the building and sealed off the town of 8,000 people. All businesses closed, schools were evacuated and the streets were left deserted except for lines of police vehicles and units of heavily armed officers clad in combat gear. These new photographs, released the same day defiant Charlie Hebdo survivors printed a special edition of the magazine, show the final moments of the nightmare, which rocked the world . The end of the pursuit on Friday played out on live TV and social media as one hostage was eventually freed from the printing plant .

Masked and helmeted troopers with automatic weapons were seen peering out of a blue helicopters buzzing overhead. As the standoff continued, police attempted to negotiate with the brothers but were told: ‘We are ready to die as martyrs.’ The terrorist brothers then charged out of the building firing Kalashnikovs at the security forces before being shot dead. The end of the pursuit on Friday played out on live TV and social media as one hostage, owner Michael Catalano, was eventually freed from the printing plant. The siege came two days after the Kouachi brothers burst into the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in a terror raid and slaughtered 12 people, including a police officer outside the Paris building on January 7 . Siege: Masked and helmeted troopers with automatic weapons were seen peering out of a blue helicopters buzzing overhead while officers were on the ground . Mr Lepere emerged unscathed from the shootout and was taken to a psychological assessment unit where it is understood he was to be reunited with his family last night. These new photographs, released today when defiant Charlie Hebdo survivors printed a special edition of the magazine, show the final moments of the nightmare, which rocked the world. Almost simultaneously, a kosher supermarket in Paris was stormed where Amedy Coulibaly killed four hostages and threatened more violence unless the police let the Kouachis go. He had already killed a woman police officer. Al Qaeda brothers Cherif (left) and Said Kouachi were both shot dead by police as they tried to fight their way out of the industrial building . Clamour: The latest issue of Charlie Hebdo, produced one week after many of its editorial staff were murdered, reportedly sold out across France within minutes . Charlie Hebdo resurrected its irreverent and often provocative newspaper today, featuring a caricature of the prophet Mohammed on the cover. The magazine, which normally sells around 30,000 copies a week, had an initial unprecedented print run of three million. This has been increased to five million after copies were snapped up today. Issues of the magazine had sold out across Paris news kiosks this morning within minutes. Newsagents across the country stocked the magazine, which was also being given away for free on some Air France flights. A handful of magazines are expected to be available in the UK by the end of the week, but eager British eBay users are bidding three-figure sums for the survivors' edition. The latest cover shows a weeping Mohammed, holding a sign reading 'I am Charlie' with the words 'All is forgiven' above him. It is appearing on newsstands one week to the day after the assault in Paris by two masked gunmen that killed eight members of the Charlie Hebdo staff, including its editor and three other cartoonists, along with two police officers. They said they were wreaking vengeance for the magazine's blasphemous cartoons and jokes about figures sacred to Islam. One killer shouted 'Charlie Hebdo is dead!' following the massacre. A top leader of Yemen's al Qaida branch has claimed responsibility for the attack. Nasr al-Ansi, a commander of Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the branch is known, appeared in an 11-minute internet video, saying that the massacre at Charlie Hebdo was in 'vengeance for the prophet'. Al-Ansi said France belongs to the 'party of Satan' and warned of more 'tragedies and terror'. He said Yemen's al Qaida branch 'chose the target, laid out the plan and financed the operation'. The latest issue of Charlie Hebdo maintained the intentionally offensive tone that made the newspaper famous in France. The first two pages include drawings by the slain cartoonists: One shows a well-known late French nun talking about oral sex; another shows Muslim, Christian and Jewish leaders dividing up the world. The lead editorial lays out a vigorous defense of secularism, and of the newspaper's right to lampoon religions and hold their leaders accountable - and ends with a critique of the Pope. 'For the past week, Charlie, an atheist newspaper, has achieved more miracles than all the saints and prophets combined. 'The one we are most proud of is that you have in your hands the newspaper that we always made,' it reads. It also includes a drawing of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, with a message wishing him good health, penned by murdered cartoonist Georges Wolinski. This picture was the last tweet by the magazine before the attack. Elsewhere readers will find doodles by the magazine's editor, Charb, and a cartoon showing two terrorists ascending to heaven. One, puzzled, asks where all the virgins are that they were promised. In the background the slain staff members are seen on a cloud having sex with multiple women.","Snipers are pictured poised on roof and armed police shown preparing to descend on the print works .

"TLC's My Strange Addiction returns to screens this evening, this time offering a unique insight into the lives of two British woman, one  who is addicted to eating bricks another who is obsessed with Pamela Anderson, and an American who is married to a carnival ride . Since the age of 17, Patrice, who is now 29, has consumed more than half a ton of bricks, having first been introduced to the bizarre snack idea by her grandmother. 'I started eating brick in my late teens,' the Londoner explains in the show. 'I got the idea to do it from my grandma who told me that my auntie and uncle, when they were kids, used to dig the wall and taste it. Scroll down for video . 'I just can't stop': Patrice, 29, has been eating brick since the age of 17 . True romance: Linda, 56, has been married to Bruce - a carnival ride - for the past three years . Carolyn, 29, is obsessed with Baywatch star Pamela Anderson and makes a living impersonating her . 'One day I ended up trying it myself - and I couldn't really stop.' Patrice has not gone one single day in the past 12 years without consuming brick, and has even chewed a two-foot hole in her bedroom in order to feed her addiction. 'You can just hear her going into town going crunch, crunch, crunch,' her husband Calvin reveals. 'You get this cringe feeling when you hear it. 'But obviously to Patrice, it's heaven.' Her addiction is now so severe that Patrice likens herself to a drug addict; not a minute goes by when she is not thinking about where she can find her next fix, a problem which she believes is made even worse by the wide range of brick structures that surround her home in London. 'London is full of brick,' she says. 'The Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, the roads. Brick is everywhere. I'm having this constant reminder of brick, brick, brick. Obsessed: Patrice's addiction has become so severe that she is unable to go even a day without eating brick - and she regularly tears holes in her walls in order to feed her addiction . Family affair: The Londoner was first inspired to eat bricks after her grandmother revealed that her aunt and uncle had tried it as children . 'It's always at the back of my mind, I've always got to have it, I've always got to go and get it. 'When I eat brick, it's like a drug to a drug addict. You feel good for a while - until you need it again.' But while Patrice's bizarre addiction has not prevented her from enjoying a relatively normal life, including what seems to be a close bond with her husband, her Strange Addiction co-star Linda hasn't managed to balance her own obsession in quite the same way. The 56-year-old is an object-sexual, meaning that she has romantic feelings towards inanimate objects. Linda has been married to 'Bruce', a 70-ton carnival ride, for the past three years, and has previously enjoyed relationships with both a locomotive and an airplane. 'Some women like tall men, some women like men with a colorful personality, he's got all of that,' she explains, . 'To me, Bruce is just amazing when he stands up and is spread out.' Must be love: Linda stores Bruce in a trailer in her garden, and frequently spends the night in there herself . Dinner for two: The pair often share candlelit dinners together in their trailer . Linda stores Bruce on her property; his main structure, which she enjoys climbing, is kept outside, while the cars that form the rest of the ride are stored in a trailer. 'I love being in here,' she says of the trailer, which also contains a bunk bed where Linda sleeps when she wants to spend the night with Bruce. 'I usually set up a table and have a candlelight dinner. It's really nice being in here with him. 'And I can have more closer moments with him than with the main load outside and all my neighbors staring in the yard. You do want that closed doors scene.' But she insists that sexuality is not the basis for her relationship with Bruce, but rather her intimate and romantic feelings towards the metal structure. 'It's the feeling in my heart, it's a love affair between flesh and steel,' she explains. 'We're just an old couple. We're a sweet old couple.' Carolyn, 29 from Liverpool has spent $40,000 on procedures to look more like her idol Pamela Anderson . During the episode producers fly Carolyn to LA to visit the beach where Baywatch was filmed . While Linda is hopelessly devoted to her fairground ride, another Strange Addiction star has found her self utterly devoted to one blonde actress. Carolyn, 29, from Liverpool, is a British Pamela Anderson impersonator, dubbing herself the 'Scouse Pammie' and her obsession with the star has reached striking levels. In the program, Carolyn reveals that over the years has spent $40,000 on procedures including Botox, a boob job, chemical peels, lip injections, lip tattooing and hair extensions, to make herself look more like her idol and a further $160,000 on clothes, a process she calls: 'The manifestation of my Pammification.' During the program Carolyn meets Baywatch star Alexandra Paul who compliments her on her boob job . As well as cosmetic surgery Carolyn has changed her name to Anderson, a process she calls Pammification . Carolyn, who has even changed her surname to Anderson, and makes a living as a Pam impersonator but had always dreamed of going to Hollywood. The episode sees the producers of My Strange Addiction arrange for the mega fan to fly to Los Angeles to live out her life as the Baywatch star. While there, the 29-year-old dons a red bathing suit and run along the beach where Baywatch was filmed She also meets Baywatch star Alexandra Paul for lunch who admitted it was 'odd' to meet someone who impersonated a friend. Despite her first doubts about Carolyn, Alexandra complements her on her boob job and then refers her to a casting agent. Carolyn went in for an open audition but the casting agent struggled with her Scouse accent and her 'Scouse Pammie' alter ego and told her she might have a chance as an actress if she was just herself. But Carolyn told the cameras: 'Scouse Pammie is who I am, if I stop being Scouse Pammie part of me would die. I will never stop tweaking myself, I will never stop enhancing or improving myself.'
