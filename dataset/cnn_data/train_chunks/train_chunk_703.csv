An Al Qaeda-linked group claimed responsibility for twin suicide bombings that struck outside the Iranian Embassy in Beirut today, killing 23 people including an Iranian diplomat. The obscure Abdullah Azzam Brigades said it carried out the mid-morning bombings in a Hezbollah stronghold - the latest strike in battles that have played out in the region for decades and now intensified with the civil war next door in Syria. The authenticity of the claim could not be independently verified but it was posted on a militant website and on the Twitter account of Sirajuddin Zurayqat, a prominent Islamic militant leader. The group said it will continue with such attacks until the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group withdraws its forces from Syria, where the group is fighting alongside President Bashar Assad's forces against the mostly Sunni rebels seeking to topple him.

A TV news anchor in Colorado is so fed up with people taking photos of their snow-covered patio furniture to show how much snow has accumulated whenever there's a storm that he devoted two whole minutes of airtime to explain to viewers that they can do better. 'C'mon, Colorado. We can do better than this. We love winter. We own winter. Let's take the pictures to prove it,' 9NEWS anchor Kyle Clark said in his humorous rant. Clark - who is originally from Upstate New York - feels that, given Colorado's natural beauty, residents should start taking photos of things slightly more impressive than the patio furniture they bought at Costco. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fed up: Colorado anchor Kyle Clark thinks the state's residents can do better when it comes to photographically documenting snow storms . Enough: 'Yes, everyone is impressed you have a four-piece set - we saw it at Costco, too' 'We live in one of the most beautiful spots on earth but we point our cameras towards the back porch...yes, everyone is impressed you have a four-piece set - we saw it at Costco, too.

Clark explains that there are simple things people can do to make their winter patio shots a little more interesting. According to Clark, 'if you like it then you should have put a thing on it.' Clark suggests including a 'disgruntled dog' in your winter, patio shots.

People take shots of their patios, Clark explains, because it's easy - you just 'point the camera out the window and click.' But - as Clark points out - Colorado residents don't 'take the easy way out.' 'We blasted a road through the Rockies. We put a cliff in a Mexican restaurant,' Clark says. 'Our welcome sign is a demon horse with crazy laser eyes. We don't do easy around here.' Clark ended his rant by dropping his lapel mic, as if to say 'peace, I'm outta here.'

Good thing he wasn't around: Elwyn Fossedal, 81, insisted if he were in the same room as President Obama that he would shoot him dead . An 81-year-old ‘birther’ from Wisconsin has been arrested for threatening the life of President Barack Obama. Elwyn Fossedal, of Madison, made the threat last month at a local post office and repeated it several times, including while being interviewed by Secret Service agents. ‘If President Obama was here I would shoot him right there and kill him right now,’ Mr Fossedal said, according to an affidavit on the Smoking Gun. Horrified bystanders notified police of the threat, they passed the information on to a local Secret Service field office. Agents interviewed Mr Fossedal the day after he made the threat and he refused to back down. Mr Fossedal ‘would not recant [the threat] made towards the President and repeated the threat using different words,’ the affidavit reads. ‘He also made a number of additional threats towards the President,’ the document continued. Agents looking into the potentially dangerous man’s background discovered that his wife of 57 years recently passed away. ‘He is displacing his grief of her loss with anger,’ said the affidavit. Agents also discovered Mr Fossedal is very familiar with firearms, and deemed him a threat. The threatening man also posted a video to his Facebook account arguing to 'save our 2nd Amendment!' The Second Amendment provides Americans the right to bear arms. The agency determined he is a ‘birther’ after disseminating his online activity, including calling for the President’s impeachment and declaring ‘we need to throw the Muslim in the White House, OUT,’ the Smoking Gun noted. He also resigned from Lions Club International over religious differences stemming from the group’s move into Muslim countries. The retiree faces as many as five years in prison if convicted, it is not clear when his next court date is.","Elwyn Fossedal, 81, made the threat at a local post office .

"By . Ryan Gorman . PUBLISHED: . 21:38 EST, 24 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:16 EST, 25 November 2013 . It has been claimed that Miami Dolphins player Richie Incognito paid off a woman who accused him of molesting her with a golf club last year during a charity golf outing. The much maligned lineman was accused of molesting a female volunteer with a golf club and dumping water on her head, according to reports. He forked over cash to make the allegations go away, according to a report. News of the payout was first reported by the Miami Herald, which quoted 'a Dolphins team source.' Anything but: Richie Incognito looms large on the field, but he's imposing off it as well - and paid a woman to keep quiet . The source told the Herald that Mr Incognito paid 'in the ballpark of $30,000 to convince the woman to clam up. The paper also reported, citing ESPN reporter Adam Schefter, that the lewd lineman was hauled into the commissioner's office shortly before the 2012 season for a talk about that incident and another involving drinking. No further details were given. The harassment allegation became public after WPLG obtained a copy of the police report filed May 18, 2012 by the 34-year-old woman. Mr Incognito’s lewd behaviour occurred during the annual Fins Weekend Golf Tournament at the Turnberry Resort and Club, the incident report said. The woman accused the footballer of using a golf club to rub her privates and knock her glasses off her head, a copy of the report reviewed by MailOnline alleges. The woman said Mr Incognito had been drinking during the event. ‘After that, he proceeded to lean up against her buttocks with his private parts as if dancing, saying ‘Let it rain, Let it Rain!’ The report said. ‘He finally finished his inappropriate behavior by emptying bottled water in her face,’ said the report.The woman told cops arriving on the scene that several people saw the inappropriate behaviour and did nothing to stop it. Bring him back!: Fans want the infamous player back in uniform . More than frenemies: Richie Incognito (center left), seen on the bench with Jonathan Martin (center right) who claims he was the subject of daily harassment . Had Mr Incognito simply apologized, it does not appear she would have filed the report. Instead, ‘she felt like he didn't care and thought the whole incident was in fun and games,’ the report reads. ‘Other people apologized for him, but not him.’ Dolphins team security said they would handle the issue when it was brought to their attention, but the woman told authorities nothing was done. The woman is not allowed to speak publicly about the incident after signing a confidentiality agreement, according to WPLG. The golf outing accusation is the third in a series of shocking stories involving the previously under-the-radar football player. Last month, a series of voicemails left for teammate Jonathan Martin emerged that showed Mr Incognito using racial slurs and threatening physical violence against him. Mr Incognito was suspended indefinitely from the team while an investigation is carried out. Mr Martin has since left the team to seek counseling, and accused unspecified teammates of threatening to rape his sister. Martin says he was harassed daily, and Incognito acknowledged leaving a voicemail for Martin in April in which he used a racist term, threatened to kill his teammate and threatened to slap Martin's mother . In the time since his suspension, Mr Incognito has told those close to him that he feels betrayed by Mr Martin, a rookie that other Dolphins have publicly said the veteran took under his wing. A source told ESPN the allegations 'shocked' Mr Incognito, and that he feels betrayed. 'It's probably a combination of totally blindsided and a bit betrayed,' the source told the network. 'He's shocked. He can't believe this happened and thinks it probably could have been avoided.' To his credit, several teammates have spoken out in favor of Mr Incognito, and also said many of the comments were taken out of context. 'I don't think what happened is necessary,' teammate Tyson Clabo told ESPN. 'I don't know why he's doing this. And the only person who knows why is Jonathan Martin.' Just this past week, a video emerged of an out-of-control, drunk, shirtless Mr Incognito rampaging through a bar shouting the n-word as terrified patrons dove for cover. The team has not publicly commented on the two latest incidents.","A 34-year-old woman accused Richie Incognito of molesting her with a golf club last year during a team-sponsored charity golf tournament .

A child is feared to have eaten part of another toddler's ear after a small part was torn off at a nursery. Daniyaal Abubaker suffered an injury to his right lobe on his second day at Mucky Pups Day Nursery in Garretts Green Birmingham. The boy, who will be two this weekend, needed 10 stitches and spent two nights in hospital following the incident. Daniyaal, pictured with his mother Afsha and father Mohammed Abubaker, lost part of his ear while at nursery . His mother, Afsha, 26, said the family had been given different versions of events including the theory that he had been bitten by another child. The missing part of his ear has not been found, sparking fears another toddler may have eaten it. It is feared that another child may have eaten the ear as the missing part of the lobe has not been found . Mrs Abubaker, a carer, said: 'We still don't know what happened to our son to this day, but to see your son in terrible pain with part of his ear missing was just horrific. 'I couldn't stop crying. Daniyaal has been left traumatised. 'Sometimes when I move close to his face to kiss him he gets upset, he doesn't like anyone to go close to his ear. He has been scarred mentally, not just physically.' Ofsted inspectors visited the nursery shortly after the incident and rated it as inadequate saying risk assessments were not 'rigorous enough', adding that the nursery did not 'address all safety issues'. Mrs Abubaker said she received a call at around 11.30am on September 25 from nursery owner Paula Tidmus to say her son had injured his ear in a fall and that he 'might require stitches'. She claims her sister-in-law Madiha Hamid phoned the nursery shortly afterwards, only to be told Daniyaal had been punched. Mrs Abubaker claims another sister-in-law, Arooj Arooj, picked injured Daniyaal up from the nursery, where Mrs Tidmus told her that he had been 'bitten' by another child there. Daniyaal was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital where he had an operation on his ear the following day. Mrs Abubaker said: 'I contacted police as I have heard different versions of events and don't know exactly what happened to my son that day. Daniyaal had to spend two nights in hospital to be treated and he had 10 stitches put in his ear . Mucky Pups Day Nursery in Garretts Green, Birmingham, was rated as inadequate by Ofsted inspectors when they visited days after the incident . 'When I spoke to Paula again, and asked her what had happened to the piece of ear, she said the child must have swallowed it.' Owner of the nursery Paula Tidmus declined to comment adding that the case was being dealt with by her solicitors and insurers. A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'Specialist officers from West Midlands Police Public Protection Unit are reviewing an incident, in which a young child suffered an injury to his ear. 'Officers are in the process of contacting the family and relevant agencies, including Children's Social Care, as part of the ongoing inquiry.' Ofsted inspectors visited the nursery on October 2 and gave it a rating of 4 - ‘inadequate' and flagged up health and safety issues as an area of concern. The report said: 'Risks assessments are not rigorous enough as they do not address all safety issues in the nursery and staff do not help children learn how to be safe during activities.' The report said that if the nursery didn't make the necessary improvements, enforcement action would be taken. It will be inspected again within 12 months of the date of this inspection.","Days after the incident Ofsted inspectors rated the nursery as inadequate .

A Minnesota man is being held in an Arab jail after putting a spoof video about youth culture in Dubai online. Shezanne Cassim, 29, was arrested in April and charged with violating a 2012 cyber crime law that has penalties for allegedly challenging authorities, his attorney, Susan Burns, said. Mr Cassim, who was moved to a maximum security prison in Abu Dhabi in June, has been accused of endangering national security. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Shezanne Cassim has been in a UAE jail since April after making a spoof video about Dubai's youth culture . He is the first foreigner arrested under tougher measures governing internet use in the United Arab Emirates, according to the Emirates Center for Human Rights. Mr Cassim entered a not guilty plea in court, and made a statement about his involvement in the video, which he created and posted online last year, his brother, Shervon said. Several other people who featured in the video have also been held in jail, alongside Mr Cassim, who was born in Sri Lanka before becoming an American citizen. The 29-year-old, who has a degree in political science, moved to Dubai after graduating in 2006 and worked at Emirates Airline before taking a job earlier this year as a business consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers. His family was initially told a verdict would be issued on October 28, but the verdict has been postponed five times, most recently because a judge was waiting for an Arabic translation of the video. 'In all this time, they have refused to grant bail, with no explanation given,' Shervon Cassim said. His brother’s next court date is December 16. United Arab Emirates authorities did . not return messages seeking comment from Associated Press. The U.S. Embassy had no comment. A . message left with the U.S. State Department was not returned, and Mr . Cassim’s attorney in Dubai said in an email he had no comment. Spoof: Shezanne Cassim helped create and upload a comedy video about Dubai . Fight club: The spoof video followed the fictional Satwa Combat School where fighters use sandals to attack . The U.S. government cannot force a foreign leadership to release American inmates but it can demand immediate access to them. Members of Minnesota’s congressional delegation, including Senators Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, have tried to intervene, pressing the United Arab Emirates’ U.S. ambassador for answers, according to the Star Tribune. Mike Davies, director of global public relations for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the company was looking into the matter. The case reflects a wider crackdown by Gulf Arab authorities on social media use. In the past two years, dozens of people have been arrested for Twitter posts deemed offensive to leaders or for social media campaigns urging more political openness. Ms Burns said the video was posted on YouTube in October 2012, about a month before the cybercrimes law was enacted in the United Arab Emirates. She said her understanding of the law was that it included penalties of temporary imprisonment and a fine up to nearly $250,000. The video, called Satwa Combat School, is set in the Satwa district of Dubai. The family said in a statement that the parody pokes fun at Dubai teenagers who called themselves 'gangstas', but were known for mild behavior. Comedy: The light-hearted video showed fictional fighting techniques . Detained: Shezanne Cassim and several of the people featured in the video were arrested in April . The video shows fictional combat training, including throwing a sandal and using a cellphone to call for help. It opens with text saying the video is fictional and is not meant to offend. 'It’s tragic. It’s something that can happen to anybody, especially young people who post all the time on YouTube,' Ms Burns said. 'To be incarcerated over something that’s clearly a joke, clearly meant in jest, clearly meant in good humor - and held for seven months - is a violation of human rights.' Shervon Cassim, who spent two months in Dubai trying to help his brother, said the family wants authorities there to 'realize that this is not worth their time and just release him'. 'At a time when the United Arab Emirates is holding itself out as a modern country, it is sadly ironic and a poor image to present to the world that it continues to imprison my brother for uploading a silly video,' he said.","Shezanne Cassim accused of endangering national security .

He is the Made In Chelsea lothario who's affectionately dubbed 'pug' and 'fat boy' by his co-stars. And now Spencer Matthews has revealed that he decided to get into peak physical condition ahead of season six of Made In Chelsea after looking in the mirror one day and realising he was fat. Speaking to MailOnline, the Chelsea boy said: 'The weight just creeps up on me. I woke up one day, looked in the mirror and thought. ""Oh great, I'm fat again"".' New man: Spencer Matthews reveals that he has lost weight and made an effort to change his ways ahead of the new season of Made In Chelsea . The Eton-educated star recently lost over a stone at an intense boot camp and has already been using his new physique to attract women after breaking up with Stephanie Pratt. 'Losing weight certainly helps with the ladies,' joked Spencer, who counts his idols as Collin Farrel, Jake Gyllenhaal and David Brent. 'Mine and Stephanie's relationship always had an expiry date, it was never going to last. I didn't allow myself to fall deep into the reals of love; she lives in LA so it was more of a holiday romance. 'We are still close and she is arguably the nicest person I've ever met,' he said of his American-born former flame. More than meets the eye: Spencer thinks that people perceive him as someone who sits around 'sipping champagne and sh**' but he is actually 'honest, hardworking and ambitious' Speaking about the upcoming season of Made In Chelsea, Spencer said we will see a different side to the usually outspoken womaniser, insisting that he has even stopped going out clubbing. Instead, he has been focusing on work and last week released his debut autobiography. Speaking about his tome, he said: 'Initially I thought it was arrogant for a 25-year-old to write their own autobiography, but it was a fun project. 'My break-up with Lucy Watson was bad so I sat inside and penned the book. Despite popular belief, I wrote it myself and I really enjoyed doing it.' Changed his ways: He shot to fame as the show's resident womaniser, but Spencer maintains that he has changed and hasn't told one lie this season . Despite having a very privileged upbringing (his parents own the prestigious Eden Rock hotel in St Barths and he was educated at some of the world's top schools), Spencer maintains that he was never spoiled as a child and worked hard for his money. 'Money was never thrown at me. I was only given £150 a month between the age of 12-15 and my father never helped me with money. 'I made money through hard work and graft, I worked in a hotel as a waiter and as a nightclub promoter so now I have a firm understanding of money.' Still close: His relationship with Stephanie Pratt has come to an end, but Spencer still maintains she is the nicest girl he's ever met . He is also hoping that by reading his book - within which he reveals details of the tragic death of his brother - people will see a different side to him. 'People think I sit around sipping champagne and s*** but hopefully this book will give people a deeper insight into who I am.' Spencer, who describes himself as 'kind, ambitious and honest (in the end)', has big plans for the future. 'In five years time, in an ideal world, I will be acting in some way, in small movies perhaps. 'I have connections in LA because I went to film school there so when the time is right I will look into it. I've read a few scripts but I'm not ready to move yet. 'Made In Chelsea is doing so well and the story just gets better and better,' he said.

Swedish furniture retailer IKEA says it has spiked an article about a lesbian couple in the Russian edition of its customer magazine because that would have broken the country's new law on gay propaganda. The story, which features British lesbian couple Clara and Kirsty, appeared in the December print edition of the firm's club magazine. In the feature the couple talk about their life in Dorset, and raising their children. IKEA has spiked a story about British lesbian couple Clara and Kirsty from the Russian version of its customer magazine . But IKEA spokeswoman Ylva Magnusson confirmed that the family-focused feature had been removed from the Russian edition of the magazine. She said that Russian law has 'restrictions regarding promoting homosexual relationships' which led to the decision to replace the article. Ms Magnusson told the Aftonbladet newspaper: 'That's the reason why Russia has another article . IKEA previously angered traditionalists in Italy when it featured two gay men on a billboard advertisement . 'We have two guiding principles in the communication we distribute from Ikea. The first is home interior design. The second is following the law.' She said that the decision was taken in an effort to 'remain neutral' and said: 'We think our operations in Russia can, in the long run have a positive effect on society.' The IKEA Live magazine is distributed across Europe to customers enrolled in the firm's IKEA Family loyalty scheme. But gay rights activists in IKEA's founding country Sweden have branded the company 'cowardly' for removing the article. Swedish gay rights campaigners have said that the article could have been used as a test case to see what the Russian law's mention of 'propaganda' actually means . Ulrika Westerlund, chair of the Swedish Federation for lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights (RFSL) told The Local: 'I find it disappointing that Ikea has simply laid down flat. 'No one is really sure what 'propaganda' is and if Ikea had left the article in, that could have served as a test case.' In June Russian president Vladimir Putin signed into law a bill which bans 'propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations to minors.' There are fears in the country that this law will outlaw any expression of gay rights including holding hands or kissing in public. Last year, Ikea also came under criticism for airbrushing women out of the version of its catalogue published in Saudi Arabia.","Article about British couple spiked in Russia after concerns about new law .

John Chen Lui Lu infected his patients with a deadly bug during heart surgery, when he constantly changed his gloves mid-operation . A disgraced NHS heart surgeon who caused infections which led to the deaths of five patients has been allowed back to work, it has emerged. John Chen Lui Lu infected his patients with a deadly bug during heart surgery between December 2008 and July 2010, when he constantly changed his gloves mid-operation. Dennis Mills, 82, Michael Smithers, 67, Bernard Heald, 83, Alan Daniels, 73 and Albert Rigley, 63, all from Nottinghamshire, died as a result of contracting the staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria. An inquest in 2010 heard Mr Lu had a habit of changing his gloves in the middle of surgery and of 28 heart patients who had valves inserted by him - 11 fell ill. The outbreak sparked a major health scare, with more than 100 patients who had undergone heart surgery at Nottingham City Hospital having to be recalled for tests. At the time Nottingham coroner Dr Nigel Chapman slammed Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust for not recognising the infection quickly enough. But yesterday it emerged the surgeon has been allowed allowed back to work - and may return to the operating theatre  -  despite his fatal mistakes. A spokesman for the NHS Trust confirmed: 'Following our investigation, we commissioned an independent review by one of the country’s eminent endocarditis experts to consider all of the evidence associated with this case and to advise on the clinical risk of the surgeon’s return to operating. 'This report was reviewed by two further authoritative expert microbiologists. 'A re-entry programme is being carefully developed and has recently been shared with the surgeon and his advisers for consideration. The outbreak sparked a major health scare, with more than 100 patients who had undergone heart surgery at Nottingham City Hospital (pictured) having to be recalled for tests . 'This is standard practice when a surgeon returns to operating after a prolonged absence. We have involved patients in this process. 'The surgeon continues to work clinically at our hospital, doing post-operative and outpatient work. Michael Smithers, 67, a heart patient who died at Nottingham City Hospital after the surgeon passed on an infection during an operation . 'We will keep our community and patients informed regarding the outcome of our discussions.' The inquest heard suspicions were first raised about an outbreak in May 2009 year when doctors became aware of two cases of endocarditi. But after failing to pass on the information to an infection control doctor it was a further two months before a link was made to Mr Lu. The connection was finally noticed by microbiologist Tim Boswell and Mr Lu was stopped from operating. Yesterday Dr Boswell said: 'It was a busy time, and I can say that these types of things are very rare. 'Whether or not he comes back to performing operations is still in discussion.' The bug is carried on the skin and is normally harmless, unless it attaches to a foreign body, such as an artificial heart valve. Lawyers representing the families of the five men who died claimed it was 'glaringly obvious' that Mr Lu’s habit of changing his surgical gloves mid-operation was responsible for passing on the bacteria. But the surgeon and NHS managers said this was 'not established' despite a coroner ruling he was undoubtedly the cause of the infection.","John Chen Lui Lu infected his patients with a deadly bug during surgery .

Biter: Leake Academy girls basketball coach, Doyle Wolverton, is accused of biting a player in the face. The coach was apparently angry during the time out and was in the face of the girl. It escalated and the biting happened on the court . A girls' high school basketball coach in Mississippi has resigned after being accused of biting a player in the face. Leake County Sheriff Greg Waggoner says Leake Academy coach Doyle Wolverton is accused of biting the unnamed player during a timeout in a November 12th game. The player was brought to a hospital emergency room in Carthage after the team returned, and hospital employees called the sheriff's office because the injury allegedly stemmed from an assault. Wolverton resigned Monday, though the Leake Academy coach said he couldn’t 'confirm nor deny' that claim. According to the complaint, which was filed by Toby Thaggard of Carthage, Wolverton allegedly grabbed Thaggard’s daughter, listed as the 'victim' in the report, 'by the shirt and then bit her on the right side of the face,' as if he was getting on to her for making a bad play. 'We’re not commenting on that today,' Leake Academy headmaster Jerry Crowe said Monday afternoon. 'We’ll comment more on that (Tuesday).' The report then states Thaggard took the victim, whose name was redacted in the complaint, to the emergency room, where deputies observed a “bruised bite mark on the lower right side of her face. 'We haven’t been involved with anything directly since (the hospital) because the parents and coach are trying to settle matters themselves,' Waggoner said.

Details: According to the complaint, which was filed by Toby Thaggard of Carthage, Wolverton allegedly grabbed Thaggard¿s daughter, listed as the 'victim' in the report, 'by the shirt and then bit her on the right side of the face' Stellar Record: Wolverton had more than 1,200 career wins over his 38-year careers. His team won 15 private school state championships during his tenure, including seven straight from 2006-12 . A police report obtained by WJTV-TV states a deputy took pictures of the bite mark. The girl's parents took her to the hospital to get medical treatment for her bloody and bruised face. Waggoner says the family decided not to file charges after Wolverton resigned. Despite the police report, Hattiesburg native Marty Stamper said he didn’t notice anything atypical when he attended the game. 'Usually if something goes on, you’ll have parents or somebody carrying on and hollering,' Stamper said. 'There was none of that, and I was sitting straight across from the Leake Academy bench.' Wolverton currently ranks second  nationally in wins by a high school girls basketball coach (he trails Leta Andrews, who is still coaching  in Texas and has 1,375 career wins).

The family of an 85-year-old Korean War veteran from California who is detained in North Korea are fighting to get the beloved grandfather home by Thanksgiving. Merrill Newman, of Palo Alto, traveled to North Korea with a friend as part of a tour group based out of Beijing, China. But, as he was about to fly back to the U.S. on October 26, a uniformed North Korean officer came on the plane, asked to see his passport, and then requested he be removed from the flight, his son, Jeffrey Newman, said Wednesday. 'My dad got off, walked out with the stewardess, and that's the last he was seen,' the younger Mr Newman said. Merrill Newman's traveling companion, former Stanford University professor Bob Hamrdla, was allowed to return and later told ABC News that it must have been a 'terrible misunderstanding.' 'I hope that the North Koreans will see this as a humanitarian matter and allow him to return to his family as soon as possible,' Mr Hamrdla said. The U.S. Department of State has declined to publicly confirm Mr Newman's detention, only saying that the agency has updated its travel warning for North Korea, recommending that Americans refrain from traveling to the Communist country. 'U.S. citizens crossing into North Korea, even accidentally, have been subject to arbitrary arrest and long-term detention, ' the DOS said. Jeffrey Newman said his father was a constant traveler but had always wanted to visit North Korea, and took lessons in the language before leaving on the nine-day trip. 'This has been a lifelong dream of his,' he said. Mr Newman said he believed the desire for the trip came from the three years his father spent as an infantry officer in the Korean war, but he said Merrill Newman never talked about his service.

North Korean officials and he came away with some uneasy feelings. 'We think that the conversation was difficult at times,' Mr Newman said, but did not know details. The . U.S. has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, but a state . department official told the San Jose Mercury News that the Swedish .

Merrill Newman has lived in a retirement complex with his wife, Lee, since 2011 in Palo Alto, where he's a big part of the alumni community at nearby Stanford University, his son said. Golden years: Newman retired from finance in 1984 and has been living with his wife, Lee, in this 10-story retirement home in Palo Alto called Channing House .

Judge Paul Batty QC deferred Musgrave's sentencing for six months so he may spend Christmas with his 14-year-old daughter for the first time . A drug dealer who has spent the last 14 Christmases in prison has been spared jail by a sympathetic judge so he may spend the festive season with his daughter. Richard Musgrave, 35, begged Judge Paul Batty not to send him to prison after spending every Christmas in his teenage daughter's life behind bars for a string of drug-related crimes. The father from Carlisle, Cumbria, was told to 'stay out of trouble' for the next six months in return for a non-custodial sentence after admitting one count of methadone, a Class A drug. Carlisle Crown Court heard how Musgrave, who appeared alongside two others, also pleaded guilty to two counts of theft before being told he could spend the festive season at home. Judge Batty said: 'I am going to give you the best Christmas present you could ever hope for now - your liberty, but it will be in measured terms. 'If you stay out of trouble for the next six months you can expect a non-custodial sentence - because I always keep my promises. If you offend, to custody you will go.' Prosecuting David Potter described how Musgrave used an old key to let himself into the home of his former long-term partner where he stole £40 from her purse in June. He later stole a pack of bacon from a Spar shop, the court was told. In his defence, barrister Tim Evans described the man as 'a hopeless, long-term drug addict' who 'has tried to do something about his addiction.' In light of his efforts to overcome his long history of drug abuse, the judge deferred sentencing for six months. Musgrave’s co-defendants John Thompson, 34, and Kirsty Davidson, 25, admitted being concerned in the supply of heroin and methadone, while Davidson also pleaded guilty to the supply of methamphetamine. Mr Potter described how police raided the Cumbria home shared by Davidson and Thompson and found various drugs - including cocaine hidden in a Kinder egg - and drug paraphernalia. Traces of heroin and methadone were found in plastic sandwich bags, while as much as £93 worth of methadone was found in two bottles in the house. Musgrave appeared at Carlisle Crown Court alongside two other defendants who were imprisoned for offences relating to drug dealing . Thompson and Davidson admitted being addicted to drugs, yet initially denied supplying them to others. However the former's defence told the court the pair dealt the illegal substances to fund their own habits. Brendan Burke, for Davidson, said his client played a lesser role in the drug supply offence, and that she had returned to drug abuse after the death of her father. Judge Batty jailed Thompson for 32 months, while Davidson received a sentence of two years.","Richard Musgrave spared jail to spend first Christmas with his daughter .

Godfrey Bloom has said speed is nothing to do with road accidents and motorists are the most oppressed group of people in Britain . Speed has ‘nothing’ to do with road accidents and motorists are Britain’s ‘most oppressed group of people’, Godfrey Bloom said last night. The controversial MEP, who resigned the UK Independence Party whip in Brussels earlier this year, will be unveiled today as the new face of campaign group the Driver’s Union. Mr Bloom has told the Mail he is has had enough of the EU and Ukip and he’s now planning to run for Parliament in a bid to speak up from the UK’s 35 million motorists. In an outspoken return to British public life, Mr Bloom criticised charities which use the families of road accident victims in their advertising. And he branded the police and other motoring groups guilty of ‘extortion’ for telling drivers they can avoid penalty points by going on a speed awareness course. The Drivers Union was founded by Keith Peat, who spent 32 years in the London police where he was an advanced police driver and motorcyclist and is now an expert in crash statistics. Mr Bloom said he would publicise evidence that speed cameras have been positioned as revenue raising measures and then seek to milk motorists for more cash afterwards. He said: ‘The police can set a trap for you and then they can intimidate you into taking one of their profit-making driving courses. I don’t know of anything else in the British constitution where the police can suspend prosecutions in exchange for money. ‘Speed is not the offence. In law the offence is driving without due care and attention or reckless driving. ‘Speeding on its own is meaningless. It has nothing to do with accidents. ‘Most road accidents take place at 15mph or disproportionately involve young men. It’s a complete misuse of resources to carry on as we are.’ Taking on road safety charities like Brake, Mr Bloom said: ‘I don’t like these charities who make their points using the grieving mothers of road accident victims. 'You get these emotional women talking about how their child has been killed. But those people are killed because the driver wasn’t driving with due care and attention. Mr Bloom has told the Mail he is has had enough of the EU and Ukip and he¿s now planning to run for Parliament in a bid to speak up from the UK's 35 million motorists . ‘Speed is not to blame - or every formula one driver in the world would be dead.’ Mr Bloom also has groups like the AA in his sights, which he accuses of promoting speed awareness courses rather than speaking up for motorists. ‘The most oppressed group of people in the United Kingdom are our 30 million motorists. Regularly coerced and exploited by profiteers at the expense of genuine road safety, whilst using charities with no expertise in road safety to pave the way for their activities. ‘I do not believe that the interests of road safety and of UK’s beleaguered drivers can be best served unless we focus on genuine non-profit road safety. ‘I intend to work for an evidence based, not for profit road safety campaign so long overdue. I have accepted the Driver’s Union offer to become an Executive Patron.’ Mr Bloom resigned the Ukip whip in Brussels earlier this year after controversy around comments he made describing female members of Ukip as ‘sluts’. He had already strained the patience of Ukip leader Nigel Farage by attracting claims of racism when he denounced foreign aid being sent to ‘bongo bongo land’. Mr Bloom is still an ordinary member of Ukip but now sits as an independent MEP. He also remains flat mate to Mr Farage in Brussels. Mr Bloom says he has been inundated with supportive messages from voters in his Yorkshire seat and allies say he could easily win re-election to the European Parliament as an independent. But he told the Mail he now wants to run for election to the Westminster Parliament. ‘It’s even money at the moment,’ he said. ‘I’ll have a go if a suitable seat presents itself.’","Controversial MEP criticised charities which use families of road accident victims in advertising .

Conservators at the V&A, which was given the remaining contents of Constable's studio by the painter's last surviving child, Isabel, in 1888, found the sketch while attempted to remove the lining on the reverse after it became loose. The oil sketch, above, which depicts a brick kiln on Hampstread Heath was discovered in the back of another of the painter's work, 'Branch Hill Pond, Hampstead' The V&A, which will be putting the previously unrecorded oil sketch on display tomorrow, said that Constable, who died in London in 1837, probably painted the scene in the late summer of 1821 or 1822. During the period, the artist, who is known for his English landscapes, painted a number of sketches featuring similar cloud studies and motifs. Conservators Clare Richardson and Nicola Costaras found the preliminary oil sketch while preparing works for a major 2014 exhibition, Constable: The Making Of A Master. 'Branch Hill Pond, Hampstead', which has been on display for 125 years was being refurbished when the new sketch was discovered hidden in its lining . X-radiography had already revealed evidence of another composition, but it had been assumed that this was a sketch covered over when Constable painted Branch Hill Pond: Hampstead. Constable, above, is known for his paintings of the Suffolk countryside, he was thrifty with materials and sometimes painted sketches on both sides of a support . The oil sketch, painted on canvas measuring 24.5 x 39.4cm, depicts a narrow clearing fringed by trees set against an unsettled sky with a brown cylindrical structure, thought to be a kiln, in the foreground. Constable, who was more successful in France than England during his lifetime and is known for his paintings of the Suffolk countryside, was thrifty with materials and sometimes painted sketches on both sides of a support. Experts believe that he painted the sketch outdoors in London's Hampstead, on canvas which was probably pinned to the lid of his paint box for support. The V&A was given three Constable easel paintings, 92 oil sketches, 297 drawings and watercolours and three sketchbooks in 1888. Next year's exhibition Constable: The Making Of A Master, will represent the English painter alongside Old Masters of classical landscape such as Jacob van Ruisdael and Claude Lorrain.","Work was discovered in the back of 'Branch Hill Pond, Hampstead'

Drivers have described the terrifying moment they hit a 'wall of blackness' before dozens of cars collided 'like pinballs in a machine' on the M5 in Somerset killing seven and injuring 51. Bristol Crown Court heard how smog built up during and after a fireworks display at Taunton Rugby Club which then drifted across the road. Collisions began just six minutes after the £3,000 display which had been organised by 51-year-old Geoffrey Counsell, and involved 1,500 shots in 15 minutes. Drivers on the motorway before the pile-up told a jury how conditions on the road were good until they suddenly hit a 'black wall of smoke' which 'enveloped' their cars . Counsell, of Ashill in Somerset, is charged with breaching health and safety regulations by failing to ensure the safety of others, which he denies. Drivers on the motorway before the pile-up told a jury at the court how conditions on the road were good until they suddenly hit a 'black wall of smoke' which 'enveloped' their cars on November 4, 2011. One motorist, David Thompson, said: 'It was hard to be sure as I could not see the lane markings. I found it difficult to know if I was even travelling in a straight line in my lane. 'I felt like I was in free fall, but the only thing I could do was to continue to drive straight. 'I'm not sure if I hit another vehicle or another vehicle hit me.' View of the wreckage on the M5 in Somerset for which Geoffrey Counsell is facing a Health and Safety prosecution at Bristol Crown Court . Laura Kitchen, a trainee accountant from Honiton, Devon, said: 'I suddenly lost all visibility - it was so sudden it was although someone had just thrown a blanket on my windscreen. 'I couldn't even see the bonnet of my car.' While TNT lorry driver Perry Mead said he could hear sounds from the firework display by the side of the motorway as he entered the smoke. He said: 'I could hear sounds of cheering and music like a fairground off to the left. 'There was no visibility at all so I began to break heavily just waiting for when I would hit something.'I felt that at any point something would appear in front of me. 'I couldn't hear the sounds of any vehicle skidding, it seemed as if the vehicles were crashing without braking.' Stephen Crowle was driving from Plymouth in Devon to Gloucestershire with his wife Susan on the evening of the tragedy. The couple stopped at Taunton Deane services just after 8pm and rejoined the motorway at around 8.20pm, Mr Crowle told the jury. 'We suddenly hit what I consider almost like a black wall,' Mr Crowle said. 'Visibility dropped dramatically, certainly from almost 200 feet, 200 metres or so, to virtually nothing. 'Thankfully there was very little traffic around. Instinctively, when you are hit with no visibility you brake. 'It was smoke. It was very dark, it was black. After six or seven seconds the road just cleared and that was it really.' Mrs Crowle, a front-seat passenger in the Nissan Qashqai, added: 'As we passed the junction we suddenly, it was very, very suddenly, came into a wall of blackness. 'It was very dense, we couldn’t see anything. It was obviously very frightening.' The patch lasted several seconds and then suddenly cleared, said Mrs Crowle who told the jury she had been using that stretch of the M5 since 1975. 'As we carried on out of the blackness, I put my window down. 'It was like the after-smell of fireworks and smoke,' she said. 'My reaction was we were lucky we didn’t hit anything but there wasn’t anything close to us.' Philip Smith was driving his Peugeot 306 from Plymouth to Windsor with his son-in-law, wife, daughter and granddaughter. 'The weather was clear. Suddenly I drove into what I would describe as a mix of smoke and fog that was black in colour. It came out of nowhere,' he told the jury. Aftermath: View of the wreckage which shows burnt out cars along the M5 where seven people died . Bristol Crown Court heard that the smog built up during and after a fireworks display at Taunton Rugby Club and drifted across the road . Pile-up: One driver said her car hit a patch of white mist as it entered the M5 at junction 25 . 'It was so thick. It was like something out of a movie. It was like you were in a bright room and someone turned the lights off. 'I have never experienced anything like it. It happened so quickly it caused me to brake quite hard. 'Visibility was at zero. It was absolutely black. I couldn’t see the bonnet of my car. 'It was quite scary. It was the worst thing I have driven through.' Geoffrey Counsell, 51, was in charge of the fireworks display in Taunton, smog from which caused a fatal crash on the M5, Bristol Crown Court heard . A statement read from one driver, named only as Mr Kingsland to the jury, said he was travelling along the motorway in his silver Ford Galaxy car. 'Within a fraction of a second, it seemed my windscreen went completely white, as if a blanket had been thrown over it,” Mr Kingsland said. 'I was completely taken by surprise. The first thing I noticed was three brake lights illuminated in front of me. 'I immediately thought I was going to hit the vehicle in front so braked as hard as I could, it was a full emergency brake situation. 'I can’t remember what happened next apart from to say I was hit at least four to five times from the side to the rear. 'At this point I thought the next was going to kill me and felt very vulnerable. 'I would liken it to being in a pinball machine.' In another statement, Peter Morgan, said conditions were fine on the motorway until his BMW X5 suddenly hit 'black smoke'. 'My vehicle seemed to be completely enveloped,' Mr Morgan said. 'I had no view out of the front, sides or rear out the windows. 'I then saw the large tail lights of a lorry only a few metres in front of me. I then braked very hard and managed to bring the car to a halt, about ten feet behind the trailer. 'I remember thinking ""God, I am stopped on the motorway in thick fog, I need to move"". I then felt an impact to the rear offside of my vehicle.' Richard Thorne, an articulated lorry driver for Langdon Transport with 20 years of experience, had been lying down in the bunk of the lorry while colleague Perry Mead drove. He told the jury he first felt the brakes being applied 'really, really hard' - leaving him clinging on to the seat in front of the bunk. 'I could only see how thick the windscreen glass was,' Mr Thorne said. 'I couldn’t see anything on the other side of the glass. Malcolm Beacham (left) and Bristol lorry driver Terry Brice (right) who were killed in the crash on the M5 . 'It was just brown, swirling with bits of black stuff in it. I couldn’t see the windscreen wipers. 'I was just holding on because if I had let go I would have just been flung forward onto the windscreen.' Mr Thorne said he jumped into the front seat as soon as the lorry came to a halt. Kye Thomas, former soldier and lorry driver who was killed in the crash on the M5 near Taunton . 'As soon as I sat down, we got hit really hard by another truck,' he said. Michelle Craker was driving her white Renault Traffic van from Devon to Gloucestershire to visit her parents for an anniversary celebration. Mrs Craker told the jury: 'I remember thinking ""it is a lovely evening"", it was quiet, it was the perfect time to travel.' Mrs Craker, who was driving with her young son and husband, said the vehicle hit a patch of white mist as it entered the M5 at junction 25. She said the fog was not severe enough to warrant braking and she simply took her foot off the accelerator to pass through it. 'The fog got slowly thicker but it was still white,' Mrs Craker said. 'Then the car went into dark fog or dark smoke but I could still see red lights (of the car in front). 'It got thicker. I could just see the lights. Then they didn’t go anywhere, they just went out. I braked. 'We didn’t see anyone, we just hit whatever was in front of us. 'We got hit almost immediately, two seconds later, by something behind us after the airbags had gone off. Her husband, Matthew Craker, added: 'It was literally like someone had thrown a bag over my head. 'It was clear, then it was definite fog, then it was a total blackout within a period of less than 30 seconds.' The motorists said the smoke cleared relatively quickly after the collisions. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Bristol Crown Court heard smog built up during a fireworks display .

A clifftop mansion was demolished yesterday before its new owner could move in because large parts of the property had fallen into the sea. Ridgemont House, which is perched on the top of Oddicombe Cliffs in Torquay, Devon, seemed like a bargain when it was sold for just £154,000 at a blind auction in 2010. But its value plunged dramatically before telephone bidder Sue Diamond had the chance to live in it when constant landslides and erosion rendered it uninhabitable. Fallen away: Demolition work gets underway on Torquay's world-famous clifftop property, Ridgemont House . Dangerous: The property has become uninhabitable as clifftop erosion has brought it closer and closer to the edge of Oddiscombe Cliffs . Retired policewoman Sue bought the property in 2010 without having a survey completed despite its proximity to the rapidly-eroding cliff-face. Since then the condemned 1930s house has slowly collapsed - room by room - onto the beach 150ft below. Torbay Council sent in demolition teams yesterday to start pulling down the last remains of the crumbling structure from the 1930s. The workman were forced to used a crane to gain access to the ruins amid fears the ground could give way. Local resident Don Proctor said: 'They started taking the roof off first, then the windows and the doors. It's such a shame as it was a magnificent property back in its day. 'There's one hell of a crack in the walls - the rest could literally go at any moment.' Set . in one of the most expensive areas of the so-called English Riviera, . Ridgemont House would have been worth £400,000 had it been situated 100 . yards or so further inland. Neighbouring . homeowners have also seen the price of their homes plummet, with one, . Tor Cottage, recently selling for just £33,500 - about a tenth of . what it would be expected to sell for elsewhere. Sale: Sue Diamond bought the property in 2010 without having a survey done, despite its proximity to the rapidly-eroding cliff-face . Tearing apart: Workers were forced to access the house by crane because of fears the ground could give way . Rubble: Part of the roof had been ripped away and only half of the house's front was left standing . Heavy machinery: Torbay Council is behind the demolition work, although the owner of the house will have to foot the bill, which will run into thousands of pounds . Miss Diamond, 59, tried to sue the builder from whom she bought Ridgemont House in February 2010. But a judge ordered her to pay what she owed because the auctioneers had warned buyers it was severely structurally damaged and might be beyond economic repair. The property could land its owner with yet another hefty bill after Torbay Council said it would be looking to claw back the cost of the demolition. The local authority send in contractors when a deadline passed for Ridgemont House to be pulled down privately. A spokesman said: 'We have appointed contractors to demolish the property and we will be looking to reclaim the cost of the demolition in due course.'","Ridgemont House, which hung on the edge of the Oddicombe Cliffs in Torquay, Devon, was rendered uninhabitable .

Mr Wrigley, from Manchester, who joined the Royal Fusiliers in September 1914 and was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant in 1917, took the book with him into the frontline and it survived the 1914-18 conflict.  The couple went on to marry. 'Osborne Dearest': The front page of the book Dora Pimley made for her soldier lover Osborne Wrigley . The book, which comforted the young soldier from Manchester, was made by his girlfriend, pining at home .

Two mysterious safes that have lain unopened in a municipal building for at least a generation will be unlocked this month. The safes are in an old Jersey City vault that has . been turned into a storage and file room. City officials say they were probably installed in the middle part of the last century, but . they have no idea exactly when, or which mayor ordered their . installation - or what is in them. Two mysterious safes in an old Jersey City vault that has been turned into a storage and file room are to be opened . And when newly-elected Mayor Steve Fulop found them he was intrigued, and ordered them to be opened, NJ.com reported. Fulop said he has spoken to former Mayors Gerry McCann and Jerry Healy, who each said they knew nothing about the history of the safe and never tried to open it. 'We don't know when the safes were installed or what they were used for but they are quite old,' Fulop said. 'None of the living mayors we spoke to recall them ever being opened or used. We thought it would be interesting to find out what may be inside and will have a professional open the safes. 'Jersey City's political history makes you wonder why a safe - much less two - was installed in the mayor's office.' Among the colourful former mayors of Jersey City are Frank Hague, who was known as 'the granddaddy of New Jersey Bosses' and served from 1917 to 1947, and Bernard Berry, who served from 1953 to 1957 and tried to ban rock and roll music from within the city limits. Former city employees say the safes always had rumours around them, one being that Hague used them to store kickbacks received from city workers. Healy, who preceded Fulop as mayor and served two terms, said he never gave the safes much thought and never tried to open them.  As far as he knows, none of his predecessors did either. 'I've never been in the safe and I have no idea how far back it goes,' Healy said.  'I don't think anybody's been in it in years.  That was from the good old days or 'bad' old days when there was more money floating around city hall.' Former Mayor Gerry McCann, who served two non-consecutive terms in office first in the early 1980s and later in the early 1990s said he remembers the safes but has no idea what might be in them. He's not sure if he opened either of them during his tenure, but if he did, it didn't leave an impression. 'I don't know if we opened them, I don't remember.  If we did, I don't remember anything in it,' McCann said. He said the safes were much like Hague's desk, which still sits in city hall.  The desk, which has a two way drawer that opens outward to anyone facing its occupant – rumored to be Hague's preferred way to collect cash payouts – has been in use in the municipal building for the better part of a century. 'Everybody thought Hague's desk was a big deal, but I didn't want it, it was a ratty old desk,' he said. Healy said, while definitely intriguing it's probably not wise to go all Geraldo Rivera over them. 'They're probably empty,' he said.  'That's my guess.' Fulop said the city will contract a locksmith to open them sometime next month.","Safes are in an old vault that has .

A teacher who slipped in 'something gooey' as she side-stepped a slice of discarded ham was awarded a £17,000 compensation pay out, it emerged today. The teacher was awarded the money after . she fell while trying to avoid the meat, which had been dropped on the . floor of the lunch hall at Backwell School in Backwell, Somerset. Her claim was among a number of bizarre payouts, estimated to have cost councils in and around Bristol nearly £150,000, prompting warnings about a 'compensation culture' in schools. A teacher who slipped in 'something gooey' as she side-stepped a slice of discarded ham on the floor of her school lunch hall was awarded a £17,000 compensation pay out (file photo) Across England a total of £4million has been paid out in compensation and costs by councils for accidents and injuries at schools. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: 'Education chiefs must resist the creeping compensation . culture that is to be found in too many schools these days.' South Gloucestershire Council found itself embroiled in an eight-year legal battle after a teacher tripped on a football net, a saga which ended in a four day court hearing. The teacher got his foot caught in a loose goal net and was demanding £30,000 in compensation - but was handed just £619.50. However, because the council was judged to be partly to blame for the accident it was forced to pay £82,070 in legal fees, including the cost of the claimant’s solicitors. The money was paid in 2011-12, eight years after the accident at the undisclosed school in 2004. Council spokesman Dominic Moody said: . 'The council contested the claim on the basis that the teacher had been . negligent of their personal health and safety. 'The . judge found that not only was the claimant 50 per cent responsible for . their own accident but the injuries were far less serious than claimed, . resulting in a compensation payment of only £619.50, significantly less . than the £30,000 originally claimed. 'The . bulk of the costs were the claimant’s solicitors’ fees which, in spite . of our success in the case, were awarded, in their entirety, against the . council. 'Under the old . regulations, the costs followed the case, regardless of contributory . negligence being found on the part of the claimant. 'This . particular case ran for eight years with four days in court, hence the . high level of costs, and, as the council were found contributory . negligent, the costs were awarded in their entirety against the . council.' Across England a total of £4million has been paid out in compensation and costs by councils for accidents and injuries at schools (file photo) He added that reforms introduced at the end of July this year meant that in future cases, such 'disparity of costs compared to damages' should not happen again. North Somerset Council has dealt with 35 claims made by teachers, support staff and pupils between 2008 and 2013 relating to incidents in its schools, including the ham-related fall at Backwell School. At St Katherine’s School, in Pill, a pupil was awarded £15,719 after he cut his knee open on a protruding paving slab. The youngster was running towards the school’s playing fields with his classmates to play rugby when he slipped on wet leaves and fell down a grass bank. A boy at Worle School, Weston-super-Mare, was awarded £9,666 after he slipped on a wet floor in his tutor room and landed on his elbow, causing it to fracture. And at St Martin’s School, in Worle, a pupil was handed £12,442 after suffering burns to an arm while working with a teacher to build a wooden rocket. The youngster said the teacher had refilled a glue gun and pumped it, causing the substance to drip on to the unnamed pupil’s arm, causing burns. Other recent claims in South Gloucestershire include one by a teaching assistant who fractured her foot after catching her shoe on an uneven playground surface while loading waste into a skip. In February 2011, she received £2,800 in compensation and the council had to pay a further £7,500 to cover the claimant’s legal fees. Fear: The TaxPayer's Alliance has warned that education chiefs must resist the 'creeping compensation culture' found in many schools after a number of payouts for accidents and injuries . Bristol City Council said it could not supply details of compensation claims made by teaching staff and students in the last few years because it could lead to the disclosure of personal data. Hilda Kalap, spokeswoman for the authority, said: 'We have only had one successful compensation claim made by teaching staff against the council over the last five years.' The total claimed by tripping teachers and slipping students in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire was £148,127. The pattern seems to be repeating itself across the country, after Kirklees Council in West Yorkshire was forced to pay £20,000 after a teacher took the authority to court after being bitten by a flea. The bite triggered an allergic reaction which caused ulcers and pain lasting for two years. Initially the council refused to pay up, saying it was not negligent, but then coughed up. A spokesman said: 'The case was . settled out of court following legal advice and the claimant received . compensation of around £5,000. 'The remainder was spent on the necessary legal fees. 'This was an unusual situation. Other . medical conditions meant the bite became infected, leading to swelling . and ulceration and up to two years of pain.' Another case cost a London council . £220,000 - including £174,000 legal and other costs - when a teacher . suffered nose and eye injuries after being hit in the face with a set of . maracas in Hounslow. And in Rochdale, a teacher who strained their back while lifting a table received over £10,000. However, teaching union NASUWT dismissed claims that there was a compensation culture within schools. General secretary Chris Keates said: 'It is a myth that compensation is easy to obtain.'","Teacher at Backwell School in Somerset fell over in lunch hall .

A leading baby food manufacturer is investigating after a mother found a two-inch needle in her tiny daughter’s milk powder. Julie Wakeling had already fed six week-old Skahayla from the £10 tin of Cow & Gate anti-reflux formula when she spotted the spike lurking in the powdered milk.

DNA extracted from a young boy who died 24,000 years ago could prove that the first Native Americans were European. The genome of the four-year-old boy, who died in south-central Siberia, is the oldest sequenced to date. It provides an insight into origins of Native Americans whose ancestors are believed to have travelled across Siberia into the Americas during the Ice Age. DNA extracted from the skeleton of a young boy who died 24,000 years ago could prove that the first Native Americans were European . A cross-section of an arm bone from the 24,000-year-old skeleton found in Siberia. Researchers managed to extract DNA from the bones and trace the ancient individual's genetic lineage . Writing in the journal Nature, the researchers claim that around 30 per cent of modern Native American ancestry comes from the young boy’s gene pool. ‘The result came as a complete surprise to us,’ said Professor Eske Willerslev from Copenhagen University who led the study. ‘Who would have thought that present-day Native Americans, who we learned in school derive from East Asians, share recent evolutionary history with contemporary western Eurasians?’ The 24,000 year-old boy was unearthed in . the 1920s by Russian archaeologists near the village of Mal'ta, along . the Belaya river in Siberia. Scientists from Copenhagen University in Denmark took a sample from the boy’s arm bone, extracted DNA from it and compared it to existing Native American populations. The boy was buried with a variety of artefacts including a Venus figurine . They found that DNA from the boy's Y chromosome and from the mitochondria (the energy factories of the cells) were of types found today in a region encompassing Europe, West and South Asia and North Africa. Interestingly, the boy showed no similarities with populations such as the Chinese, Koreans or Japanese. This puzzled researchers as today's Native Americans are closely related to East Asians. One theory is that the boy’s future relatives mixed with the ancestors of East Asians at some time after he died. This result paints a picture of Eurasia 24,000 years ago which is quite different from the present-day context. The . genome of the young boy indicates that prehistoric populations related . to modern western Eurasians occupied a wider geographical range into . northeast Eurasia than they do today. 'It tells us that these individuals that . were living in Siberia- in south-central Siberia 24,000 years ago- their . genes contributed to first Americans' genes,' Texas A&M University . researcher Kelly Graf. 'I think what it does is it helps to clarify some things and the first is that the Americans came from Siberia. 'Some archeologists had suggested that the first Americans could have come from Europe directly from transoceanic migration, and I think that this does a fairly good job clarifying that: it was a land migration or at least a coastal migration through Beringia.' The 24,000 year-old boy was unearthed in the 1920s by Russian archaeologists near the village of Mal'ta, along the Belaya river in Siberia . Land route: The findings dispute earlier theories that American ancestors came from Europe, instead suggesting they came from Siberia and traveled by an earlier land attachment in the Bering Sea . Previously, researchers had thought that people came from Europe into East Asia, and then entered Siberia from the south. The latest results suggest the Siberian inhabitants may have come from the West and that there were multiple waves of migrations in Asia around this time. The research could also help explain some mysteries surrounding Native American origins. For example, some early American skeletons - such as the 9,000-year-old Kennewick Man from - have physical features that, some believe, are typically European.

Britain has started spending again, fuelling the economic recovery. Household spending leapt by the highest level for more than three years, as the nation was buoyed by a return to strong growth. But there were warnings that the economic upturn is too reliant on on consumer spending while trade struggles. Household spending rose by 0.8 per cent in the three months to September, the highest rate since mid-2010 . The Office for National Statistics confirmed that the economy grew by 0.8 per cent from July to September. However the overall economy remains 2.5 per cent below its pre-recession peak of early 2008. Latest figures show household spending rose for an eighth successive quarter, with the 0.8 per cent increase the highest since the second quarter of 2010, as the recovery took hold. Households spent £237billion in the third quarter of 2013, up from a low of £229billion two years ago. The ONS said: ‘The growth in household consumption may reflect improving economic conditions over the year-to-date that would be supportive of this growth.’ While families returned to spending, exports dropped by 2.4 per cent - the sharpest fall since the second quarter of 2011 - while imports increased by 0.4 per cent. The economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the third quarter of this year, bolstering signs that the recovery is taking hold . The net trade deficit increased from £5.5 billion to £8.9 billion over the period, the highest level since the third quarter of 2010. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers World First, said: ‘Growth in the UK continues to be driven onwards by private consumption, house building and investment. These elements have had to make up for a violent slip in exports.’ Wage rises lagging behind inflation meant the consumer growth behind the recovery was at risk, he said. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: ‘The 2.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter fall in exports is extremely disappointing and net trade is currently a major drag on overall activity. ‘If the recovery is to be sustained at a healthy pace, it really does need a marked, extended pick-up in business investment and for exports to improve.’","Fears that return to growth is too reliant on consumer spending .

A prolific thief has been given an Asbo banning him from touching cars after repeatedly trying to break in to parked vehicles. Joshua Rushton, a convicted football hooligan, has racked up multiple convictions at the age of just 18. He was jailed for 12 weeks after police saw him try the door handles of four cars as he walked down the road in his home town of Stockport, Greater Manchester. Rushton pleaded guilty to theft and four counts of interfering with a vehicle in an attempt to steal at Stockport Magistrates' Court. In addition, he was handed an Asbo stating that he cannot 'touch or enter any unattended motor vehicle without the express permission of the owner' for the next three years. He received the unusual punishment after the court heard that he was obsessed with breaking in to cars. Stephen Gilbertson, from Stockport Police, said: 'He doesn't own a car but he can't go past one without trying the handle or seeing if there's something in it. 'He just can't keep his hands off cars.' Rushton and Joshua Forrest were seen trying to enter four different cars on the same road on October 15 this year. Forrest, 20, was also sentenced to 12 weeks in a young offenders institution. Last week, Rushton was ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work after being convicted of receiving stolen goods, two counts of theft, using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour and criminal damage.

Obsession: A policeman testified that Rushton, 18, could not walk past a car without trying the door . United won the December 2012 game 3-2 thanks to a dramatic late goal, leading to a flare-up which saw one fan confront defender Rio Ferdinand on the pitch. Rushton, who was watching the game in a pub because he was banned from stadium, ran into the ground with five minutes left in the match and was seen hurling a bottle and a coin at United fans.

Court case: Lawyers for the French woman, known only as SAS, said that her religious rights were being violated by France's burka ban (picture posed by model) Lawyers for France’s Socialist government today insisted that it would be ‘undemocratic’ for European judges to reverse the country’s burka ban. The made their claims during a hearing of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in which a 23-year-old Muslim is challenging the legislation. It was introduced in 2010, and prohibits the wearing of full-face veils, with offenders facing fines of up to 125 pounds. Ramby de Mello, a British lawyer representing the plaintiff – who was only referred to her by her initials of SAS – said she currently felt like ‘a prisoner in her own country’ and that the veil was ‘as much part of her identity as our DNA is of ours’. But Edwige Belliard, for the French government, said the ban was ‘democratic’ and was backed by ‘a strong conviction among the French public’. Ms Belliard added: ‘Wearing the full veil not only makes it difficult to identify a person, it makes her indistinguishable from other full veil wearers and effectively erases the woman who wears it.’ In a statement presented to the ECHR yesterday, SAS said she is a ‘devout Muslim and she wears the burqa and niqab in accordance with her religious faith, culture and personal convictions.’ It comes as President Francois Hollande’s government firmly implements a ban which has seen ordinary housewives arrested and criminalised in court. There have also been a number of vigilante attacks on women seen wearing the veil illegally. In a related development, the Paris Appeals Court today agreed that a private nursery had been justified in firing an assistant director who refused to remove her Islamic headscarf at work. Fatima Afif was sacked from the Baby Loup nursery school, in the Paris suburb of Chanteloup-les-Vignes, five years ago under the nursery's private rules. Such measures are viewed as highly repressive by Muslims living in France, who make up a community of more than five million people. Religious dress: A statement read to the court explained that the woman wears both the burka, left which covers the whole face, and the niqab, right, which leaves a gap for the eyes (pictures posed by models) Decision: The European Court of Human Rights, pictured, is expected to rule on the case in 2014 . Mr Hollande and his ministers insist . the so-called burka ban is needed to protect France’s secular traditions . and to stop potential terrorists and thieves using veils as disguises. But the ban has increased social tensions, with Muslims complaining of increased discrimination since it was introduced. There . were serious disturbances in the Paris suburb of Trappes this summer . after a man was arrested for attacking a police officer who stopped his . wife for wearing a veil. After . the violence in Trappes, French Interior Minister Manuel Valls said: . ‘The law banning the full-face veil is a law for women - it is not for a . second a law against Islam.’ Belgium . and some parts of Switzerland have followed France’s lead in banning . the veil, while Italy and Holland are also considering outlawing it. There . have been calls for a similar ban in Britain, but David Cameron’s . government has to date shown no interest in implementing one. The ECHR is expected to make a decision next year.","Officials said the ban is backed by 'strong conviction' of French people .

The images of the usually fearsome . predator enjoying itself were captured by wildlife photographer Steven . Kazlowski, 44, in the North Slope region of Alaska. 'The bear was just playing with the net and at no time was it stuck or trapped,' Steven said. 'I thought it might but the more I watched, the more I could see the bear knew exactly what it was doing. Frolicking: New York-born wildlife photographer Steven Kazlowski, 44, was in the North Slope region of Alaska when he spotted the animal playing with a discarded net . Snow trouble: Photographer Steven Kazlowski said the wild animal was not trapped by the net but just enjoying playing with the unusual item . 'It would put the net over its head and get under it, pulling it over its body and playing with it with a sense of pure joy.' The bear, believed to be between 4 and 6 years old, grappled with the net for nearly an hour before the novelty began to wear thin. 'When it was done, it got out of the net and stood up and moved on,' the photographer added. The . New York-born snapper took the shots from the safety of a skiff off the . shore of a barrier island along Alaska’s eastern Arctic coast. Game time: The predator spent about an hour playing around in the snow with the net left behind by a fisherman .

Bite: The flimsy net is no match for the large predator, thought to be aged between four and six years old . Carefree: The polar bear was oblivious to photographer Steven Kazlowski, who caught a series of charming portraits of the animal . 'It is not dangerous to photograph bears if you follow a few simple rules: give them their space, and be on a platform that is safe and allows you to move out of the area and away from the bears when it is time to go,' Steven said. 'You also need to watch the bear and pay attention to the animal and its behaviour. 'It takes time to learn how to read the behaviour of the animal to understand what is safe and what is not safe.' Flexing: This playful polar bear gets itself into all sorts of contortions as it takes an hour off hunting to have some fun with a fishing net . Playful: With thousands of miles of white and featureless wilderness, this polar bear appeared happy for something novel to play with . Looking at Kazlowski’s heartwarming images of the polar bear tumbling in the Alaskan snow, it is easy to forget that we are observing one of nature’s most powerful hunters at work.

She told MailOnline: 'We're campaigning because we think that lord of the manor rights have no place in this day and age. 'The concept was invented in the time of William the Conqueror for a feudal society. It's completely ridiculous that they should be in force now. 'None of us who live here were told about these rights when we bought our properties, as they weren't at the time registered with the Land Registry. 'We feel very angry that this has come out of the blue.

Barratts Shoes has gone into administration for the third time in four years, putting more than 1,000 jobs at risk. Directors at the Bradford-based chain were left with no choice after an investor pulled out of a plan to inject £5 million at the end of last week as the company sought to shore up its finances, according to a statement. It comes four years after the company went bust in 2009 when parent company Stylo threw in the towel forcing 220 of 380 stores to be shut. Just two years later, the company called in the administrators again, only to secure an 11th-hour rescue deal in January 2011. No bailout: Directors at the Bradford-based chain were left with no choice after an investor pulled out of a plan to inject £5 million at the end of last week as the company sought to shore up its finance . This time round, Philip Duffy and . David Whitehouse of financial advisory and investment banking firm Duff . & Phelps were appointed administrators on Friday afternoon. The administrators said they were reviewing the company's financial position and seeking a sale of the business as a going concern but said: 'At this stage redundancies and/or store closures cannot be ruled out.' Amid the many shoe factories of Northampton, William Barratt started his mail order company. W Barratt & Co invited customers to 'Walk the Barratt Way' in advertisements that first appeared in 1903 in the Carpenter and Builder journal. The company's Boots-by-Post service boasted that it sold 'the World’s Best Brogues at Barratt's Factory Price'. In 1913, Mr Barratt built the W Barratt Footshape works, designed to look more like a big country house than a factory. The company flourished to the extent that in 1964 it was bought by rival shoe company Stylo and made the firm’s principle brand. In 2008, Stylo – which had been founded in 1917 by Fanny Ziff, a 27-year-old Russian immigrant – purchased 24 stores from collapsed retailer Dolcis and rebranded them as Barratts. Barratts . Shoes operates from 75 stores and 23 concessions across the UK and . Ireland, employing 1,035 people, of whom 521 are part time, the . statement said. Staff have been informed and stores . are trading as usual but further announcements on the future of the . chain's outlets are expected in the next few days. Recent reports suggested that Barratts owner and boss Michael Ziff was seeking cash to pay for stock without which it would be running perilously low during the crucial run-up to Christmas. Mr Duffy said: 'Difficult trading conditions in the sector led the directors to explore potential refinancing options and additional equity for the business. 'The company had recently received an offer from an investor to inject £5 million into the company but that offer was withdrawn on the evening of November 7. 'In view of the financial position of the company and withdrawal of that equity offer, the directors were left with no choice but to appoint administrators.' The first time the business was put into . administration saw Mr Ziff, chairman of Barratts . Priceless parent company Stylo, buy 160 shops from Deloitte after the . chains were put into administration at the height of the recession in 2009. At the time, Deloitte closed 220 stores but Mr Ziff was able to safeguard around 3,000 jobs. Then, in December 2011, Barratts watched its concessions business collapse with a loss of 1,600 jobs. The firm again, however, found a buyer to rescue 89 of its standalone stores, protecting . 1,184 jobs. Nevertheless, that deal came at a cost of 191 stores and 371 concessions. Darina Kerr, partner at law firm Dundas & Wilson, said today's announcement was another example of 2011’s crop of high street casualties declining from 'walking wounded to fatally injured.' 'Barratts’ descent into administration also underlines the fact that debt arrangements alone are not a long-term solution,' she said. 'Although debt arrangements can, in some cases, be agreed to stave off total collapse, if the fundamentals of a business are not reformed to withstand rapidly-changing market trends, high street retailers will continue to risk entering insolvency after insolvency. 'Best brogues at factory price': In 1913, Mr Barratt built the W Barratt Footshape works in Northampton. Here it is in action in 1931 . 'Good footwear': By the 1920s the company was flourishing as, as this 1924 advertisement suggests . 'Given that a substantial . restructuring took place in the wake of the company’s last brush with . administrators in 2011, the terms of a new financing arrangement may . prove to be extremely onerous considering the already strict conditions . for Barratts' last rescue package two years ago.' Britain’s . battered High Street chains have been struggling in recent months as . austerity cuts continue to bite into household budgets. The challenging consumer environment is having a mixed effect on Britain’s retailers. Troubled times: Recent reports suggested that Barratts owner and boss Michael Ziff (pictured) was seeking cash to pay for stock without which it would be running perilously low during the crucial run-up to Christmas . The wealthy continue to splash out in upmarket stores such as Mulberry and Burberry, while hard-up consumers dodge mainstream chains. Last month Blockbuster's chain of film and computer game rental shops in Britain was set to go into administration for the second time in 10 months after its private equity owner failed to turn the business around.

An 'agender' teenager set on fire by another boy on a bus three weeks ago was released from a San Francisco burns unit in time for Thanksgiving. Luke ‘Sasha’ Fleischman, 18 - who does not identify as a man or woman but rather as ‘agender’ - was set on fire on an AC Transit bus in Oakland, California, by another teenager on November 7. He has spent the past three weeks receiving treatment to second and third degree burns to his legs, but was discharged in time to spend the holiday with his parents. Luke 'Sasha' Fleischman, 18, has spent the past three weeks receiving treatment to second and third degree burns to his legs, but was discharged in time to spend the holiday with his parents . 'It just feels really great to be home, and I'm really glad I can be home for Thanksgiving,' Fleischman told NBC Bay Area on Thursday morning. Speaking publicly for the first time since the incident, Fleischman said he panicked on seeing and feeling the flames. 'My first instinct was kind of dumb,' Fleischman said. 'I started waving it around trying to put it out with air, but that just fanned the flames and made it bigger.' Then Sasha did something that he remembered learning in kindergarten, he started to roll around on the ground to put out the flames. Gender-neutral: Friends refer to 'Sasha', pictured with his parents, as 'they,' them' and 'it' Despite the attack, Fleischman said he has no intention to stop wearing skirts. 'I'm . going to keep wearing the skirt. I'm not going to give it up,' he said. 'It's a big part of who I am and I don't like pants.' Fleischman's injuries required three surgeries and three weeks in the burn unit, yet he was mature enough to show compassion for his attacker. Alameda County prosecutors charged 16-year-old Richard Thomas, of Oakland, as an adult with hate crimes after he told authorities he did it because of homophobia. He faces charges of felony assault and aggravated mayhem with hate crime enhancements. Standout: Fleischman is a senior at the Maybeck High School in Berkeley, where the principal described the 18-year-old as a 'wonderful, exceptional student' 'I don't want to be too harsh, because people do dumb things, especially when they're teenagers,' Fleischman said. He doesn't think Richard Thomas should be prosecuted as an adult, even though the teen is not sure what Thomas's intent really was. 'I think it was a really dumb thing he did,' Fleischman said. 'I think you should really know better than to light someone's clothing on fire. You should be able to realize that's not just a funny prank.' ‘Richard Thomas' violent and senseless . criminal conduct resulted in severe and traumatic injuries to a young . and entirely innocent victim,’ District Attorney Nancy O'Malley said . after charges were filed earlier this month. ‘The intentional and callous nature of the crime is shocking and will not be tolerated in our community.’ Earlier this month about half the 100 students at Maybeck High School in Berkeley, where Fleischman is a student, wore skirts for Skirts for Sasha Day and carried signs reading, 'Get well, Sasha, we miss you.' Reckoning: Richard Thomas, 16, has been arrested and charged as adult with assault and aggravated mayhem with hate crime enhancements in attack on Fleischman . Thomas' mother, who identified herself only as Ms. Jackson, spoke to KGO-TV outside the courtroom. ‘I am very sorry for my son's actions. I did not raise him that way,’ she said, adding: ‘My son is not a hateful person. He's a kid, kids joke around.’ Thomas' mother added that her son regretted his actions and will write the victim a letter of apology. The junior at Oakland High School was arrested at school after surveillance video from a public bus helped police identify him as the suspected attacker. Authorities say Thomas used a lighter . to set Fleischman's kilt-like skirt on fire while Fleischman was asleep . on an AC Transit bus in Oakland at around 5pm, authorities said. Once . the bus driver realized what happened, he stopped the bus and called . for assistance but the suspect fled the scene before police arrived. Motive: Thomas, seen here handcuffed during his arrest, allegedly told investigators that he set the agender teen alight because he was homophobic . Kids being kids: Thomas' relatives, pictured . here in the courtroom, said that Richard is not a hateful person, that . the incident was a 'joke,' and that he is sorry for his actions . Fleischman's parents said the 18-year-old is a straight-A student who is interested in public transportation and has his sights set on the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology . During . an interview with police, Thomas said ‘he did it because he was . homophobic,’ Oakland police Officer Anwawn Jones wrote in a court . affidavit. Trevor . Cralle, director of the Maybeck High School in Berkeley, where . Fleischman is a senior, described the 18-year-old as a ‘wonderful, . exceptional student.’ Sasha’s friend Eve Irwin told the Oakland Tribune that those who know the teen use the pronouns ‘they,’ ‘them’ or sometimes ‘it’ when referring to Fleischman. Fleischman's parents said the 18-year-old is a straight-A student who is interested in public transportation and has his sights set on the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Fleischman's relatives set up a fundraising page for him on Fundly.com, with the hope of raising $20,000 to go toward his medical bills. The goal was surpassed 24 hour later as more than 400 supporters donated more than $21,000.

Delayed mail: A love letter written to Muhammed Siddeeq turned up more than 50 years later, long after he had married and then divorced its sender . A love letter intended for a US college student turned up in his mailbox more than 50 years after it was sent - and decades after he had married and then divorced its writer. Muhammed Siddeeq was a student at the California University of Pennsylvania in 1958 when his then girlfriend Vonnie wrote the heartfelt note. But the letter didn't reach Siddeeq until he was aged 74 and by that stage he had married Vonnie, had four children together and gone through a bitter divorce in the 1960s. The note found its way to Siddeeq despite the fact that he changed his name from Clark Moore in the 1970s when he converted to Islam and had changed address several times. The extraordinary delay in delivering the piece of mail has found its way into the latest edition of Ripley's Believe It Or Not. At the time of the letter, Vonnie was living in Pittsburgh almost 60km from where Siddeeq was studying. According to USA Today, she wrote: 'I still miss you as much as ever and love you a thousand times more.' She signed it: 'Love Forever, Vonnie.' Although the pair corresponded regularly, the letter got lost in the post. But it eventually found its way into the California University of Pennsylvania mailbox more than five decades later and ended up in Siddeeq's possession when someone contacted the university having seen a news report about it on television. According to Ripley however, the delay is not a world record, with several other pieces of mail taking long to reach their target destination. Although the couple have long been divorced, the letter did serve one purpose according to Siddeeq. He said: 'For the first time the kids could see that their mother and I, at one time, had a good, loving relationship which is important for them to know.' Siddeeq, a retired maths and science teacher, became a public figure when he pushed for an investigation into the shooting of a 16-year-old boy in police custody in Indianapolis in 1987. He was also a spiritual adviser to boxer Mike Tyson in the 1990s during his jail term for rape.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:12 EST, 8 February 2012 . A teenager was strangled to death by her scarf in a freak go-karting accident after being given no safety instructions before she took to the track, an inquest heard. Suzanne Cornwell, 18, was fatally injured when the garment got caught in the engine of her kart during an out-of-hours race in December 2009 - the first time she had ever tried the sport. An inquest into her death today in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, heard how Suzanne was one of six friends invited to the track by employee Andy Kivlin. Tragic: Suzanne Cornwell (above) was strangled to death after her scarf got caught in the engine of her go-kart, an inquest heard . But Mr Kivlin failed to give the novice driver any safety advice, or tell her to wear protective overalls and remove her scarf, which was standard practise for normal bookings at the track. After the accident, Mr Kivlin ‘panicked’ and told one of the group to  cancel the 999 call, saying he would take her to hospital in his car, the hearing was told. The coroner also heard how Mr Kivlin had not been given permission by the owner to let his friends use the track. It also emerged another member of the group, Melissa Rees-Howell, who was Mr Kivlin’s girlfriend at the time, had been told to remove her scarf by him on a previous out-of-hours session. 'Failure': An employee of Cambridgeshire Raceway (above) in Caxton did not give Suzanne any safety instructions before the out-of-hours race in December 2009, it was heard . Coroner David Morris heard evidence from Christopher Hamilton, who used to work at the raceway, that the DVD player used to show customers a safety film had broken and not been replaced. He said: 'If you saw anyone with long hair or baggy clothes you told them to tuck it in. It was the same with shoe laces. 'I felt I was thrown into the deep end. I wasn’t given any training for the safety briefings and I didn’t feel confident. 'About a month in, the DVD player broke and was not replaced, so all briefings had to be given verbally. 'I left because of the lack of pay and because I was being messed about. It wasn’t well organised.' Rushed to hospital: Suzanne had been studying at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge and living with her father David, mother Wendy and older brother Stuart when she died . Recalling the night, he said: 'I believed everyone had been karting before and was confident in what they were doing. Andy was the man in charge.' Cambridgeshire Raceway Volunteer manager Paul Shinn, who was Mr Kivlin's boss, told the inquest he had trusted him not to let people on the track out-of-hours. He said: 'Helmets are compulsory and . neck braces are optional to those over 16. Customers have to sign a . disclaimer before using the kart. 'If . you have a scarf on, you take it off. They would be told at reception, . at the briefing and if they still had it, I would take it off.' Mr Shinn described getting a phone call from Mr Kivlin on the night of Suzanne’s death. He told the hearing: 'Andy told me he had f***** up. Andy sounded upset but not hysterical. 'I . rang Phil [the owner] and left a message with his wife. Phil spoke with . Andy on the phone. Phil told me we did not need to attend and I went . home. 'Andy did not have permission to have anybody on the course after hours. I have never known it to happen before.' He added: 'The only authority Andy had was over the track as a marshall when I was there and that is it. 'I remember saying to him you know you have lost your job. I was more gutted that I trusted him.' Suzanne, . from Hardwick, near Cambridge, was rushed to hospital after her scarf . got caught in the rear axle of her go-kart on December 11, 2009. Huntingdon Law Courts heard William Hitchcock called for an ambulance, but Mr Kivlin told him to cancel it. William said: 'Andy said stop calling them, I will take her in the car myself. I told the ambulance it was not needed. 'I think he was panicked about the situation and he did not want to get into any trouble. She had started to come round. 'I decided to call back. Suzi was getting clearly worse.' She died the next day in Addenbrooke’s Hospital. A post mortem carried out by Home Office Pathologist Dr Benjamin Swift recorded the medical cause of death as ligature strangulation. Suzanne was studying at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge and lived with her father David, mother Wendy and older brother Stuart. South Cambridgeshire District Council has been given until the end of October to complete a health and safety report into the incident. The inquest also heard staff at Cambridgeshire Raceway were paid a £40 day rate cash-in-hand, but Coroner Morris ruled the running of the company was not a matter for the inquest. The inquest, which is expected to conclude tomorrow, was expected to hear from Suzanne’s brother Stuart this afternoon.

But for those looking for the perfect fit (and trying to avoid the agonising ritual of breaking in new trainers), this is exactly what Reebok suggests you do. The sports brand has brought out the new U-form+ trainer, literally the hottest running shoe on the market, designed to shrink-to-fit using heat from your hairdryer. The new Reebok U-Form+ is designed to 'shrink to fit' and mould exactly to the individual foot . The hair dryer should be held about 10cm away from the shoes for two minutes . As anyone who has worn ill-fitting trainers knows, there is nothing like a blister or a twisted angle to sabotage even the most dedicated runner, ad these hi-tech new shoes aim to put an end to these annoyances. They look like normal high-end sneakers, but they come with instructions about how to put them under the hair dryer before hitting the treadmill. Exclusive to InterSport, the Reebok U-Form+ are different from the original Reebok U-Form, which needed to be put into the oven for three minutes. The unique U-Form+ material is inside the shoe, starting in the mid-foot and wrapping around the heel. You hold a hair dryer about 10cm away from the shoes, off your feet, for 2 minutes to heat them up, before putting them on and lacing them up tightly. The material is secured around the foot by the lacing system, so when it's laced it locks down around your foot and heel. It then 'fits' round your foot, supposedly giving a perfect fit and improving running performance. A button on the heel of the shoes turns bright red when the trainers are at the correct temperature . As the trainers cool down they fit to your foot, which is meant to improve performance and reduce the likelihood of injury . The original U-Form trainers go into a preheated oven at 93 degrees Celsius for three minutes, until the 'U-Form' tab turns red. Assuming you haven't over-cooked your trainers, they should be warm but not too hot to put on. You then lace them up to your preferred tightness and wear them, while seated, for eight minutes. As they cool they shrink round your feet, and in the sitting position they should give optimal support to your feet, ankles and leg muscles. Available in both men and women's sizes, the U-form trainers cost £100, and while some amateurs might balk at spending that on something you might accidentally set on fire, running enthusiasts seem to be willing to go to any length to get the perfect fit.","Reebok U-Form+ heat-to-fit to mould perfectly to your own feet .

Jo Hilton, 34, has suffered fertility problems for more than 15 years after she was forced to terminate her first ectopic pregnancy when she was just 19. After more than a decade of crippling period pains and countless operations she had a hysterectomy at just 31, ending her dreams of being a mother naturally.

Jo has now set up a crowd funding webpage, asking strangers to help her become a mother by raising £15,000 to fund insemination of a surrogate . So Jo and husband James, 36, have pinned their last hopes on an online fundraising website to raise £15,000 to fund the insemination of a surrogate. Jo, from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warks., said: 'We are doing everything we can to try and raise funds and we wish we didn’t have to ask for help. 'But it would mean so much for us to become parents - more than anything in the world - and we didn’t know what else to do.

Over the next six years she she fell pregnant a further six times - each ending in either miscarriages or terminations because they were growing outside of the womb. She said: 'We just couldn’t hope - there was no hope left. 'We pretty much knew that everytime I got pregnant we knew how it was going to end. 'I would hope, but I would always know the outcome.' The constant trauma created huge adhesions on her bladder, womb and ovaries, causing near-constant crippling pain and permanent damage. The heartache put enormous strain on her relationship with her husband, and the pair split in February 2005. But just five months later Jo met the love of her life, James, on a dating website.

New research reveals that 2013 is set to be the year of the 'Santa Sickie' with 1.8 million Brits admitting they’re planning to call in sick at work in order to do their Christmas shopping - costing the economy £161m. A fifth of Brits (22 per cent) now believe pulling a 'Santa Sickie' is acceptable if it means they can buy all of their gifts in time - that’s one million more people than in 2012. Sneaky:  1.8 million Brits admit they're planning to call in sick at work in order to do their Christmas shopping - costing the economy £161m . With four weekends left to do their Christmas shopping, over a third of those planning a 'Santa Sickie' (36 per cent) feel forced to blag time off work to ensure they are home to collect deliveries. A further third (34 per cent) claim they’ll skive work to avoid the busy shopping crowds in the weekends leading up to Christmas and one in five (21 per cent) say they plan to call in sick so they can shop in peace while their children are at school. A packed social calendar and lack of time also plays a factor in the 'Santa Sickie' epidemic, with one in 14 (seven per cent) busy bees claiming they have to call in sick to get their shopping done because their weekends are taken up with seasonal socialising.

"Craft too small to carry enough explosives and too tricky to fly . By . Duncan Macpherson . UPDATED: . 07:22 EST, 30 September 2011 . Charged: Rezwan Ferdaus, 26, who is accused of plotting to attack the Pentagon and Capitol with remote-controlled aircraft filled with explosives. The man accused of plotting to attack the Pentagon and the US Capitol using remote-controlled planes filled with explosive would not have inflicted major damage, say experts. University graduate Rezwan Ferdaus, 26, was arrested in Framingham, Massachussets, on Wednesday and also charged with attempting to provide support and resources to al Qaeda with a view to attacking US soldiers stationed overseas. The FBI said Rezwan Ferdaus hoped to use replica military jets up to seven and a half feet long, guided by GPS devices and capable of flying at 100 mph. But counter-terrorism experts and . model-aircraft hobbyists said it would be nearly impossible to inflict . large-scale damage using model planes as they are too small, can't carry . enough explosives and are too tricky to fly. A scale model of a US Navy F-4 Phantom fighter plane similar to the one Ferdaus allegedly planned to use in an attack . Target: A surveillance photo of the Pentagon, said to be taken by Rezwan Ferdaus on a visit to Washington DC last May . 'The idea of pushing a button and this thing diving into the Pentagon is kind of a joke, actually,' said Greg Hahn, technical director of the Academy of Model Aeronautics. Rick Nelson, a former Navy helicopter . pilot and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International . Studies, said Ferdaus would have had to hit a window or other . vulnerable area to maximise damage, and that would have taken precision . flying. Chilling: Model F-86 Sabre similar to the one which Ferdaus allegedly planned to load with plastic explosive for a terrorist attack . Target: The US Capitol building was on a list of buildings Ferdaus planned to hit, say prosecutors . 'Flying a remote-controlled plane isn't . as easy as it actually looks, and then to put an explosive on it and . have that explosive detonate at the time and place that you want it add . to the difficulty of actually doing it,' he said. Ferdaus, a Muslim US citizen from . Ashland, Massachussets, was arrested after federal agents posing as al Qaeda members delivered what he believed was 24lb of C-4 explosive, . authorities said. He was charged with attempting to damage or destroy a federal building with explosives. A federal affidavit claims he began planning 'jihad' against the US in early 2010 after becoming convinced through jihadi websites and videos that America was evil. Sticksman: Rezwan Ferdaus, nicknamed Bollywood, played drums in a band . Ferdaus had a physics degree from Northeastern University and enjoyed 'taking stuff apart' and 'learning on my own,' according to court papers. He reportedly had the nickname 'Bollywood' and played . drums in a Massachusetts band, according to CBS. The model planes Ferdaus intended to use were scaled-down versions of an F-4 Phantom and an F-86 Sabre, which cost up to $20,000 and $10,000 respectively, said investigators. Ferdaus's plan, as alleged in court papers, was to launch three such planes from a park near the Pentagon and Capitol and use GPS to direct them toward the buildings, where they would detonate on impact. He planned to pack five pounds of plastic explosive on each plane, said prosecutors. James Crippin, an explosives and anti-terrorism expert, said that much C-4 could do serious damage — a half-pound will obliterate a car. But he said getting a stable explosive like C-4 to blow up at the right time would have been hugely difficult. And there were slim prospects of causing any serious damage to buildings like the Pentagon and Capitol, which are undoubtedly hardened to withstand explosions, according to Crippin, director of the Western Forensic Law Enforcement Training Center. 'Basically, I think he's suffering from delusions of grandeur,' he said.Greg Hahn said the heavier of the two models Ferdaus was allegedly planning to use could carry a maximum of two pounds of plastic explosive before malfunctioning. 'That's not including the weight of any GPS system,' he added. 'It's almost impossible for him to get this done.' Suburban idyll: The house in Ashland, Massachussets, where Rezwan Ferdaus lives with his family . After September 11, 2001, federal agents asked the Academy of Model Aeronautics' 143,000 members to watch for any fellow enthusiasts who might be buying planes with bad intentions. The Federal Aviation Administration is devising new rules for model airplanes and other unmanned aircraft, but the restrictions are aimed primarily at preventing collisions. Under current FAA rules, such planes are generally limited to flying below 400ft and away from airports and air traffic. Massachusetts prosecutor Gerry Leone, who handled the prosecution of would-be shoe bomber Richard Reid, said terrorists are always building bombs out of common, legitimate items, and imposing restrictions on buying model aircraft would not make sense simply because of this one case. Sealed off: Local police stand guard outside Rezwan Ferdaus's house in Ashland . But he said law enforcement might want be more vigilant about such purchases. Similarly, Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said recent advances in model aircraft technology could make them more attractive to terrorists, but he agreed that the answer is better intelligence. 'Kids have them, people fly them, groups are organised just to engage in this type of pastime activity,' said Mr Mica. 'It would be almost impossible to regulate.'","Craft too small to carry enough explosives and too tricky to fly .

But the sellers of SexCereal claim nevertheless that eating just three tablespoons of the stuff will leave you full of vigour all day long . A spokesman for retailer Firebox.com added: ‘Please use it  in moderation, otherwise you’ll  be climbing up the walls by lunchtime.’ The £9.99 cereal, which is going on sale in Britain for the first time, comes in two special mixtures for men and women. The spokesman said: ‘Select your preferred formula, follow the surprisingly small serving suggestion and just add milk or yoghurt.’ Designed to boost your energy  and hormone levels, SexCereal contains cacao beans and maca powder, a ground plant root with purported aphrodisiac qualities. The women’s cereal is a mixture of ginger, almonds, cranberries, sunflower seeds, oat bran, flax seeds and chia plant seeds. The male version uses bee pollen, wheat germ, black sesame seeds, blueberries, goji berries and camu camu – a fruit which is high in vitamin C.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 20:07 EST, 16 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:08 EST, 17 August 2013 . A flight recorder revealed that pilots of a UPS cargo jet that crashed short of a runway at Birmingham's airport received warnings about their rate of descent seconds before impact, investigators said Friday. National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt told reporters during a briefing that a recorder captured the first of two audible warnings in the cockpit 16 seconds before the sound of an impact, either with trees or the ground. The warnings indicated the A300 cargo plane was descending at a rate outside normal parameters given its altitude, Sumwalt said, but investigators haven't made any determination on the actual cause of the crash into an Alabama hillside. Scroll down for videos . Crash site: Federal investigators say the pilots of a UPS cargo plane that crashed in Alabama on Wednesday were warned their descent was too steep, but that air-traffic controllers didn't receive a similar warning . Shorter runway: The UPS plane was attempting to land on runway 18 which is 5,000 ft shorter than the main runway which was closed for maintenance . Tricky: This aerial view of the crash site clearly shows the hill and trees that are positioned close to the threshold of runway 18 . Alternate approach: The plane was trying to land on runway 18 which is 5,000ft shorter than Birmingham airport's main runway. There is a hill and some trees at one end which can make it 'tricky' for larger jets . Obstacles: At the start of runway 18 at Birmingham airport lay a number of trees and also a hill that can make landing a large plane 'tricky' 'We haven't ruled anything in, haven't ruled anything out,' he said. The aircraft went down less than a mile from the end of Runway 18 at Birmingham's airport before dawn Wednesday. UPS has identified the victims of the crash as Capt. Cerea Beal, Jr., 58, of Matthews, N.C., and First Officer Shanda Fanning, 37, of Lynchburg, Tennessee. Investigation: NTSB board member and spokesman Robert Sumwalt during grid search of crash site at a field north of the site at Birmingham International Airport . Landing on the runway can be tricky for pilots, an expert said, particularly those flying big jets like the twin-engine UPS cargo carrier. Sumwalt said the plane was being flown by the captain — who had 8,600 hours of flight experience, including 3,200 hours in an A300 — but investigators don't know whether Beal or Fanning had ever before landed on Runway 18. 'We're going to do our best to find out,' he said. Sumwalt said investigators will analyze the airplane's weight to determine whether it should have attempted a landing on the runway, the shorter of two runways at Birmingham Shuttlesworth International Airport. With a large hill and trees at one end, the runway lacks the electronics for a full instrument landing. That forces pilots to make key judgments about altitude while aiming a descending aircraft at a runway that's 5,000 feet shorter than the airport's main runway, which was closed for maintenance work at the time of the crash. Some pilots simply avoid landing on Runway 18 when possible, said veteran commercial pilot Ross Aimer. 'When I heard they were using Runway 18 it caught my attention because of that hill,' said Aimer. 'It's sad, but it didn't surprise me.' Aimer, a retired United Airlines captain, is now chief executive of Aero Consulting Experts, a firm based in Los Angeles. Black box found: NTSB investigators work around the tail section of the UPS cargo plane . Resting place: A wooden cross by a church is shown near the wreckage of a UPS Airbus A300 cargo plane that crashed on the north side of the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport . Points of interest: This map shows the locations where the crash occured . The NTSB previously said a preliminary investigation didn't reveal any evidence of engine failure before the plane struck trees about one mile away from the end of the runway. It crashed into the bottom of a hill less than a quarter mile after hitting the trees. The A300, which weighs about 172,700 pounds when empty, was at the end of a 45-minute flight from Louisville, Ky., to Birmingham when it went down. A flight summary from flightaware.com, which tracks airplanes, shows the aircraft made a descent in steps, which Aimer said is a 'dive and drive' method common on runways with the same navigational guidance as Runway 18. Sumwalt said the aircraft went down during its first landing attempt. Sumwalt said investigators have not found any problems with the runway's lights or navigation system, which typically provides pilots with information about their lateral position but not about their altitude, unlike those on runways where pilots can land using only instruments. Destroyed: National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Investigators examine debris of a UPS A300 cargo plane after it crashed on approach at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport in Alabama . Crushed: Part of what appears to be one of the airplane's engines is caked in dirt . Blaze: Flames rise from a UPS Airbus A300 cargo plane which crashed near the airport in Birmingham, Alabama on Wednesday . National Weather Service records from . the morning of the crash show the plane would have descended through . overcast conditions to only a few clouds at 1,100 feet. Within seconds . after the plane hit a tree and at least one turbine sucked in wood, the . twin-engine plane crashed. It . hit the base of that large hill mentioned by Aimer, who said he had . landed on Runway 18 about a half-dozen times, including on some flights . as a cargo pilot. Located . near the southern tip of the Appalachian foothills, Birmingham's airport . is nestled in a low spot between Red Mountain to the south and hills . that lie at the northern end of Runway 18, which is 7,000 feet long. The . main runway is 12,000 feet long and runs east and west, meaning pilots . don't have to negotiate the rough terrain. The . NTSB said the longer runway was closed for maintenance work on its . lights early Wednesday, leaving the shorter runway as the only path to . the ground. Runway 18 is an approved runway with a valid approach, Aimer . said. 'It is definitely legal, but it I had a choice I'd use another runway first,' he said.

He has been globe-trotting for 25 years and Michael Palin revealed yesterday he has no intention of stopping as it keeps him ‘up to the mark both mentally and physically’. The 70-year-old actor and travel presenter who was on screen late last year in Brazil - the 96th destination he has visited, said the reason why he did it is not because he is interested in being famous per se, but in educating and entertaining people. Responding to questions on Gransnet, a web forum for grandparents, the former Monty Python star said: “I always thought there’d be a time when I wanted to stop what I was doing and let others take over but I find as I get older I’ve learned more about the world, and I want to share it with people rather than sit in a chair and shut up. Michael Palin at the Iguazu Falls while filming his Brazil programme . Michael Palin, 70, has said that travel keeps him young, and he won't hang up his backpack just yet . “I’m not interested in celebrity as such, I’m interested in what I can bring to the rest of the world in terms of information, education and entertainment. “And I think the wisdom of older people is really valuable.” Age should be no barrier to anyone looking for travel adventures, he argued, “provided you’re careful and don’t try and run up and down Everest, or try and swim the Channel every afternoon.” Palin began his career as a travel writer shortly after Python ended following its run from 1969 to 1974. His journeys have taken him across the world including the North and South Poles, the Sahara Desert, the Himalayas, Eastern Europe and, most recently, Brazil. He urged grandparents to try and be adventurous, as a “well-planned” journey could “lift your spirits” as you get older and have time to yourself. “I’m 70 now, and I don’t think I shall ever stop traveling,” he said. “It keeps me up to the mark both mentally and physically and the interaction with the rest of the world and the people I meet makes me feel that there is much more that unites us all, than divides us. “This is a useful antidote to media stories which might give you the impression that the world is falling apart.” Palin returned to television drama last month after a two-decade hiatus, with a part in The Wipers Times, a one-off BBC drama based on the true story of a satirical newspaper produced in the trenches of the First World War. Michael Palin has met interesting people from all over the world on his travels. Here he is pictured while filming his documentary Around the World in 20 Years . Earlier this year, in another interview, he credited his travels as the key to ensuring his marriage has survived 46 years.

We go to cities:New York, Barcelona, Antwerp. Bit more adventurous this year, went Oman. She doesn’t like needless suffering.’ She is however ‘extremely tolerant and very down-to-earth and never admits to being impressed by anything I do. ‘Occasionally, she’ll come along and listen to me talking and say, ‘That wasn’t bad but your collar looked a bit odd.’ The way partners should do really.’","Former Python has been traveling the world for 25 years .

Arriving at the school on December 14, he shot through the glass windows of the school entrance where he met Principal Dawn Hochsprung and school psychologist Mary Scherlach, who had been alerted by the gunfire before shooting them both dead. Lanza then walked into the classroom of substitute teacher Lauren Rousseau to find her and the terrified children huddled together at the back of the room trying to hide in a bathroom.

The little girl escaped by playing dead and emerged from the school with her clothes covered in blood saying, 'Mommy, I'm okay, but all my friends are dead.' Adam Lanza, 20, shot dead 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School which will be demolished . She was the only survivor from a class of 16. The school will be demolished next week and the steel which supported the structure will be melted to ensure no-one descends on the area to collect remnants of the site. Officials have said the debris will be taken to an 'undisclosed location'. Patricia Llodra said: 'We want to be absolutely certain to do everything we can to protect the privacy of the families and the Sandy Hook community. 'We’re going to every possible length to eliminate any possibility that any artifacts from the building would be taken from the campus and . . . end up on eBay.' Demolition is expected to finish before the first anniversary of the massacre on December 14. A new school funded by a $49.3 million state grant will be built for the children of Newtown. Consigli Construction, a project management company, will be in charge of the demolition and the new build. Construction workers have to undergo background checks and will be banned from discussing what they are doing in the school.

A New York City woman who posed as the aunt of a boy killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting massacre and solicited money has been sentenced to eight months in prison. Nouel Alba, 37, pleaded guilty in June to federal charges of wire fraud and making false statements. Beginning on the day of the shootings last December, prosecutors said, Alba used Facebook, emails, text messages and telephone calls to falsely claim to be the aunt of six-year-old Noah Pozner. Authorities said she told people she was collecting donations for a funeral fund on behalf of Noah's family and the families of other victims of the shooting. Alba's sentencing followed an emotional victim impact statement given in court by Mark Mattioli, father of six-year-old victim James Mattioli. Speaking at times through tears, Mattioli asked U.S. District Court Judge Michael P. Shea to impose a sentence of 26 months, one for each of the Newtown school victims. 'Her actions were anything but gentle,' Mattioli said. 'They were immediate, intrusive, exploitative, disgusting, and they added to my feeling of victimisation.' Prosecutors acknowledged that Alba collected only about $240 through her efforts and repaid it. But special assistant U.S. attorney Jonathan Francis argued for prison time, saying Alba's actions had caused emotional harm to the community and created a chilling effect on charitable giving. Alba used Facebook, emails, text messages and telephone calls to claim to be the victim's aunt . 'It's a callous, calculating attempt to profit off the murder of children,' he said. Mattioli contrasted Alba's fraud and the actions of a man who had delivered food to his front door in the days after the shooting and asked for nothing in return. Six-year-old Noah Pozner was shot dead by Adam Lanza in his school last year . 'He chose love; she chose evil,' he said. Defense attorneys had argued in their sentencing memorandum for probation, saying Alba had suffered enough at the hands of the media as 'something of a stand-in for the actual perpetrator of the Sandy Hook massacre.' Alba has been hounded by the press, has lost her friends, has been unable to maintain a steady job and is facing foreclosure on her home, they said. Alba declined to speak at the hearing. Defense attorney Gary Weinberger compared her to a Colonial-era criminal put in the stocks to have fruit thrown at her. 'She was and has been made into an incredible pariah,' he said. The judge said he took into account Alba's position as a single mother of two children, including one with autism, when passing sentence. He said he wanted to make it clear she was not being punished as a proxy for the shooter. He said a prison sentence was necessary because of the psychological damage inflicted by Alba's actions and to deter others from committing similar frauds. 'The attempt to profit from a national tragedy,' he said, 'was outrageous'.","Twenty children were shot dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School .

About 48 per cent of Britons go to work in the wrong mindset and more than a third feel tired at the start of the week. Furthermore, the research shows that 57 per cent of workers feel anxious and stressed during the weekend in anticipation of the working week ahead. Half said they spent up to three hours working on or answering work emails or calls over the weekend. The study of nearly 6,000 adults also indicated that 52 per cent believe their health and well-being is negatively impacted by work due to lack of exercise, sleep and relaxation. 45 per cent said work had a negative impact on family . relationships, with a third considering quitting because of it. Surprisingly, 28 per cent revealed they had been in the middle of a 'romantically . special moment' with a partner when work interfered. In other countries this figure is higher, however. For Spaniards, work has ruined a romantic moment for six in ten people, while in Italy that figure is 46 per cent. The research was carried out by Westin Hotels and Resorts.

The Henley Vaporium has just opened up among the pop-up galleries and boutiques on the border of NoLita and SOHO and is being hailed the 'hookah bar of the now'. Owner Talia Eisenberg even went as far to say she wants the space to become 'like Starbucks'. So what exactly is an e-cigarette bar? According to Eisenberg - a reformed smoker who, like many, turned to electronic cigarettes to kick her habit - it is both a shop that aims to help smokers (or 'vapers', as e-cigarette users have come to be known) find the perfect device for them, as well as a hang-out where you can 'vape', drink cold-pressed juices and eat from a vegan menu. Just opened: The Henley Vaporium, an e-cigarette bar, is the first of its kind in New York, offering a place for 'vapers' - e-cigarette smokers - to hang out and sample new devices and flavors available . Oh-so-chic: The Henley Vaporium is located at 23 Cleveland Pl in NoLita, right near the SOHO border . Candy store of e-cigs: There seems no end to the flavors of vaper available, from cherry to 'Mr Miyagi'. There is a patio out back and a coffee bar . Eisenberg developed Henley, a company that purveys e-cigarettes, after being unimpressed by the e-cigarettes available at the time. '(They') didn't have the throat hit of a real cigarette,' she told The Week. Now the Henley Vaporium is her first real store and the first e-cigarette bar of its kind. They are like-minded spots in Washington and California. While the medical community continue to debate the heath effects of e-cigs, the consensus is they are much better for you than regular cigarettes. While e-cigarettes still administer a hit of nicotine - the amount of which you can test and buy at the Vaporium - they are without the tabacco and chemicals contained in regular cigarettes. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, smokers recieve some 7,000 chemicals from each cigarette. 'We have 30-year smokers who have switched over and are suddenly running again,' Eisenberg says. 'I feel like I'm doing something good for the world when that happens.' Try before you buy: Some of the flavors available, known as 'e-juice', which is inserted in the e-cigarette to flavor the vapor they produce . Henley founder Talia Eisenberg developed her own e-cigarette after being dissatisfied with what was available on the market two years ago, when e-cigarettes were relatively new. E-cigarettes have since been outlawed on all US flights . Original: Henley started with standard cigarette-style offerings before expanding into flavors . Strength: 24mg is the most nicotine on offer . Vaporium staffer Michael, whose title is officially 'vapologist', guides patrons through the flavor and device pairings. 'It's product knowledge - knowing how much of what flavor to vape,' he said. 'We want to show people this is cool. We're the hookah bar of the now.' The Henley Vaporium features a red floor, disco balls and mismatched vintage furniture. Although it is being called a bar, there is no alcohol available because it doesn't fit with the 'health' theme. The headlining feature however are the available flavors of vaper, known as 'e-juice'. They start predictably with watermelon and vanilla and go to the crazy like Jamaican Me Crazy, Nutty Buddy, Happy Ending.","The Henley Vaporium in NoLita claims to be the first of its kind .

A Kansas teenager and his biological mother have been charged with shooting dead the boy’s adoptive mother and critically injuring his adoptive father outside the couple’s home. Anthony Bluml, 18, and Kisha Schaberg, 35, were two of the four people arrested earlier this month in the case. All were charged in a six-count criminal complaint with first-degree murder in the death of Bluml’s adopted mother, 53-year-old Melissa Bluml, as well as attempted first-degree murder of Roger Bluml, who survived a gunshot to the head. Blood relatives: Anthony Bluml (left), 18, and his birth mother Kisha Schaberg (right), 35, have been charged with shooting dead the boy’s adoptive mother and critically injuring his adoptive father . Co-conspirators: Braden Smith (left) and Andrew Ellington (right), both 18, also have been charged with murder and attempted murder . Slain: Police say Melissa Bluml, 53, was shot dead at the hands of her adoptive son, his birth mother and two of the boy's friends . They also were charged with aggravated robbery, burglary and theft counts related to a purse, cellphone, coins and other property stolen worth less than $1,000 from the home. Melissa Bluml died the day after the November 15 shooting at their home in rural Valley Center, which is north of Wichita. Police have yet to determine the motive behind the murder, but a relative said that Anthony Bluml was apparently unhappy living in the home of his adoptive family. The four suspects in the case made their first court appearances Monday via video conference at Sedgwick County District Court. All four were charged with identical counts and the criminal complaint does not indicate who actually fired the shots. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for December 10, although that setting is expected to be continued to a later date. Anthony Bluml is being held on a $500,000 bond and ordered to have no communication with his adoptive father or other state witnesses. Bond for Schaberg, of San Diego, was set at $1million. Crime scene: Melissa and Roger Bluml were found shot in their car outside their home near 109th Street North and Woodlawn in rural Sedgwick County . Clinging to life: Roger Bluml, pictured right next to his wife and adopted son, Tony, remains in critical condition after being shot in the head . Also charged in the case are Andrew Ellington and Branden Smith, both 18, of Park City. The two are being held on $500,000 bond. Melissa Bluml, a vice president at Chisholm Trail State Bank, was remembered in her obituary as ‘a loving wife and encouraging mother.’ Mourners packed a Wichita-area church Friday for her burial mass in which the local priest extolled the congregation not to try to understand evil. The Wichita Eagle reported that Anthony Bluml met his biological mother two months ago in San Diego, after first communicating with her through Facebook. He and a younger brother, Chris, had been adopted by the Blumls as young children. Earlier this month, Schaberg posted a photo on her Facebook page depicting her and Anthony with the tagline, ‘Bond that can’t be broken.’ Reunited: Tony and his birth mother, Kisha Schaberg, recently reconnected on Facebook, and the 35-year-old claimed her son had told her he didn't want to live with the Blumls . Anthony Bluml, Ellington and Smith all attended Valley Central High School, where Schaberg's son was a star wrestler and also played on the football team. Authorities got a 911 call at around 9.15pm November 15 about a shooting outside the home of Melissa and Roger Bluml near 109th Street North and Woodlawn in rural Sedgwick County. Officers who responded to the scene discovered the couple shot in their car parked on their property. The Blumls were rushed to an area hospital, where the wife succumbed to her injuries the following day. Family feud: Schaberg suspected that Mrs Bluml had set her younger son, Chris, against her because the teen wanted nothing to do with her . Roger Bluml remains in critical condition after reportedly being shot in the head. Anne Carter-Hainlen described the Blumls to Kansas City Star as great parents who were very involved in their adopted sons’ lives and never missed a sporting event. Anthony was picked up by police two hours later on an unrelated traffic charge and released Saturday after posting $2,500 bond. A day after the shooting, Anthony posted a message on his Twitter account that read: 'Dear mama, ill [sic] love you forever.' The 18-year-old was rearrested along with his three alleged accomplices in the murder case last Tuesday and booked into jail the following day. Anthony Bluml pleaded guilty last July to a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct and was fined $100. Schaberg, a native of Pasadena, California, moved from Missouri to San Diego three years ago after leaving the father of her 7-year-old daughter. According to her former stepdaughter, 20-year-old Victoria Egerer, Schaberg reconnected with her biological son recently on Facebook and met face to face with him for the first time in years, the Wichita Eagle reported. Egerer said her former stepmother told her that her son did not like living with the Blumls because they were too strict and didn't let him do whatever he wanted. Disturbing claims: Schaberg's 7-year-old daughter alleged told her older half-sister that the mother and son slept in same bed in a hotel room . Tony's younger brother, Chris, who is a high school junior, did not want to have a relationship with Schaberg, leading her to believe that Melissa Bluml and her husband had turned her son against her, Egerer said. Bluml began staying with his mother in California about two months ago. The two were joined by Schaberg's younger daughter and another man, and all of them lived in the home of Schaberg's girlfriend. Schaberg and her partner later had a falling out over money, and the 35-year-old took her children to a hotel, where she allegedly slept with Tony in the same bed, according to Egerer. About three weeks ago, Schaberg informed her former stepdaughter that she was moving to Kansas along with her son and 7-year-old daughter. Following Schaberg’s arrest, the child has been taken into protective custody.","Anthony Bluml, 18, and his birth mother Kisha Schaberg, 35, have been charged with killing Melissa Bluml and shooting her husband in the head .

With 12 cleaning modes, it is being billed as the Swiss Army knife of vacuum cleaners – and it could certainly threaten Dyson. British company G-tech is taking on its bigger rival with a cleaner that is cordless, lightweight and even has headlights to help track down dirt in the darkest corners. Just 18 months ago, G-tech launched its AirRam upright power sweeper which so far this year has shifted 135,000 models, making it the best-selling cordless vacuum cleaner in the UK and overtaking Dyson in this sector. Rivalry: G-Tech are bringing out the new Multi, which follows in the success of the AirRam power sweeper . But the firm, based in rural Worcestershire, is not content to stop there and is deploying another weapon in the fight for supremacy – the handheld G-tech Multi. The Multi is powered by a lithium-ion battery – the sort of thing found in smartphones, iPads and electric cars – which means it can run for 30 minutes on a four-hour charge. Its attachments include a built-in crevice tool, a smaller round tough brush for stubborn grime and a seven-inch wide tool for cleaning sofas and curtains. Despite its small size and weight – just 1.6kg, or 3.5lb – it includes a pull-out tube to reach tricky spots. There is also a rigid extension tube to tackle dust in high places. The new device sells for £149, compared to around £173 for Dyson’s closest equivalent, the DC34 Animal. It will be available via John Lewis or from the G-tech website. Design: The new model has a smaller brush to cope with grime and a tool for cleaning sofas and curtains . Technology: The vacuum is powered by a Lithium-ion battery give 30 minutes of run time on a four hour charge . Scientist and broadcaster Adam Hart-Davis, who unveiled the new Multi, said: ‘The vacuum cleaner design is essentially 100 years old, but what we need to clean difficult, hard to get at areas is something light with fascinating features. ‘Something that will clean curtains, around the back of sofas,  all those areas you can’t get at with an AirRam. What you need is a Swiss Army knife of a vacuum cleaner and that is what they have come up with.’ He said the addition of headlights means users can see the dirt that they are trying to get rid of, particularly in dark, hard to reach places such as car footwells. Growing: The company has a team of 50, led by designer, inventor and founder, Nick Grey . Nick Grey, G-tech’s designer, inventor and founder, said he discovered from online reviews of the AirRam that many customers reverted to using old-style heavy cleaners with long hoses and tools for getting at inaccessible places. As a result, he said, the firm developed the handheld Multi as a partner to the AirRam, adding: ‘These two products together will consign the heavy, corded, energy-eating vacuum cleaners to history.’ G-tech’s turnover is expected  to double to in excess of £20million this year, with sales continuing  to grow. Dyson denied it is being out-sold by Gtech on cordless cleaners and claimed a better comparison to the G-tech Multi would be its new DC59, which costs £349.99. A spokesman said: ‘The DC59 marks something quite revolutionary in vacuum cleaning. It is the world’s first cordless vacuum cleaner to achieve the same performance as a full-size plug in vacuum cleaner. It literally sucks up as much dust as a conventional machine. ‘That is remarkable considering it is battery powered. 100 air watts on a cordless is huge. It actually offers people a real alternative to lugging around the conventional vacuum but at the same time it offers the lightweight, versatility of a handheld too.’","G-tech has sold the most cordless vacuums company in the UK this year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:50 EST, 30 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:01 EST, 30 October 2013 . British billionaire financier Alan Howard paid $43million three years ago for a Monet masterpiece that New York prosecutors now allege was pilfered by a former aide to ousted Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos. The disgraced secretary, Vilma Bautista, is currently on trial on charges that she illegally sold the 1899 painting titled Japanese Footbridge Over Water Lily Pond in Giverny from Mrs Marcos' vast collection, which the Philippine government wants back. The artwork vanished amid President Ferdinand Marcos’ 1986 overthrow ended up in Bautista’s hands and is part of a multibillion-dollar roster of property the Philippines claims the Marcoses acquired with the nation’s cash, prosecutors said. Art deal: Hedge fund manager Alan Howard (left) purchased in 2010 a Monet painting from a London gallery, which purchased it from Imelda Marcos' former aide Vilma Bautista (right) 'Hot' commodity: Claude Monet's 1899 Japanese Footbridge Over the Water-Lily Pond at Giverny is at the center of the Bautista conspiracy trial . But for all the art-world intricacies and Philippine politics, ‘at bottom, this case is really quite simple — it’s about greed and fraud,’ Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Garrett Lynch told jurors in an opening statement last week. The defense said Bautista believed that Imelda Marcos rightfully owned the painting and that Bautista had authority to sell them for her. Bautista is just an intermediary who got caught up in a decades-long dispute between a nation and its former leader, attorney Susan Hoffinger said. The debt-ridden Bautista, 74, faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of conspiracy charges, Yahoo! Finance reported. Mr Howard, the founder of the highly profitable Brevan Howard Asset Management hedge fund, who according to Forbes boasts a personal net worth of $1.6billion, has found himself embroiled in the controversy after purchasing the painting in 2010 from the London art dealer Hazlitt, Gooden & Fox. According to The Smoking Gun, the French masterpiece remains in the possession of the Swiss-based 50-year-old financier, who has paid $10millon to a class action group of 10,000 victims of human rights abuses under the Marcos regime 'in exchange for a legal release on any claims regarding the painting.' Vendors: The sale of the impressionist masterpiece was handled in 2010 by the London-based gallery Hazlitt, Gooden & Fox . Howard's representative said the affluent investor, who relocated to Switzerland several years ago, plans to take legal action against the gallery that sold him the Monet. The spokesperson also claimed that the 1899 impressionist work was not on the Philippine Presidential Commission on Good Government's original list of missing artworks believed to have been purchased by the corrupt Marcos clan using public funds. The PPCGG was established in 1986 to recover the funds swindled by Ferdinand Marcos and his greedy spouse, who scandalized the world with her shoe collection and $3,000-a-day New York shopping sprees. Bautista was a foreign service officer assigned to the Philippine Mission to the United Nations and later served as Imelda Marcos’ New York-based personal secretary and shopper, snapping up luxury Manhattan condominiums and jewelery on behalf of her boss. According to investigators, Bautista may have illegally taken the Monet along with other artworks after the 1986 popular uprising that removed the Marcoses from power. The defense claims Bautista (center) believed that Imelda Marcos rightfully owned the painting and that Bautista had authority to sell them for her . Rapacious: Imelda Marcos (left), who was ousted from power along with her president husband in a 1986 coup, scandalized the world with her enormous shoe collection . She had kept the painting hidden for two decades before putting it on the market in 2009 with the help of her two nephews, who have since fled the U.S. On her part, the 74-year-old former aide to Imelda Marcos claimed that her employer presented her with the Monet as a gift 20 or 30 years ago. But it is alleged the paper trail associated with the sale of the painting tells a different story. Before offloading the piece on the London gallery, which would eventually sell it to Howard, Bautista and her relatives reportedly attempted to sell it the New York-based Acquavella Galleries. However, the art dealers raised concerns that Miss Bautista had a 19-year-old certificate authorizing her to sell the artwork, and the deal fell through when the former Marcos assistant failed to produce a more recent document. The prosecution has alleged that the 1991 certificate was a forgery. When Bautista and her kin approached Hazlitt, Gooden & Fox through their representatives, the London-based gallery also expressed misgivings about the outdated certificate. In response, Bautista presented a letter of explanation, which appears to have satisfied the gallery since it sold the Monet to Howard just five days later. Miss Bautista walked away from the lucrative deal $32.1million richer. Some proceeds went to Bautista’s relatives and to debts; $15million stayed in her bank accounts, while Imelda Marcos knew nothing of the sale, the prosecutor said. After ruling the Philippines with an iron fist for two decades, Ferdinand Marcos was forced by a ‘people power’ revolt into exile in Hawaii. He died three years later. Crocodile tears: Imelda Marcos weeps as she listens to her husband Ferdinand read a brief statement in 1986 after their regime was overthrown . Philippine officials say Marcos and his cronies looted the country’s treasury to amass between $5billion and $1billion. The Marcoses denied their wealth was ill-gotten. With a massive collection of shoes, Imelda Marcos became a symbol of excess. But she has emerged relatively unscathed from hundreds of legal cases against her and her late husband, and she is now a congresswoman in the Philippines. She is not expected to testify at Bautista’s trial. Bautista’s lawyer said the aide sold the painting for Marcos but never had a chance to give her the money.","Brevan Howard Asset Management founder Alan Howard legitimately bought the 1899 masterpiece Japanese Footbridge Over the Water-Lily Pond at Giverny in 2010 .

A dementia patient who was treated like a 'common criminal' when police handcuffed him at a care home died two months later after 'never recovering from his ordeal', his relatives claimed today. The family of Keith Hyrons, 77, was arrested by West Mercia Police officers at Howbury House care home in Malvern, Worcestershire, after 'lashing out' at other patients. His wife Valerie, 74, claims the grandfather-of-two was left 'terrified and shaken' by the 'brutish tactics' used by the officers and stopped eating after the ordeal. The retired BT worker - who has suffered with Alzheimers for five years - lost half his body weight in two months and weighed just six stone when he passed away a different nursing home on November 8. Claims: Keith Hyrons, 77, pictured with his wife Valerie who believes 'brutish' police treatment of her husband at a care home led to his death two months later . Yesterday his devastated family said they were '100 per cent sure' the incident with police had ultimately led to his death. Mrs Hyrons, a retired nurse who was married to Mr Hyrons for 55 years, said: 'After he was handcuffed his condition really deteriorated. 'He was really shaken and terrified by what happened - I’m 100 per cent sure this is what caused him to get lower and lower. 'It was awful to watch, our family felt helpless as we just watched him slip away. He just have up after that incident with police. 'Because he stopped eating, he went from 12 stone to just six stone, he lost all that weight in about a month. Incident: Mr Hyrons had been at Howbury House care home in Malvern, Worcestershire, for just a few hours when staff called police because he was 'lashing out' at other patients . 'My husband was a caring and kind man . and extremely popular, there were over 300 people at his funeral earlier . this month and he will be sorely missed by everyone.' The pensioner had checked in at Howbury House after his wife took a trip to Spain to get some much needed rest from caring for her husband. But within just hours of his arrival, the couple’s son Leighton, 40, was called to say his father was upsetting some residents. Mrs Hyrons believes this was because . dementia sufferers have a tendency to 'lash out' and the home should . have been able to deal with it as they are medically trained. Mrs Hyrons, pictured with her daughter Lara Waldon, claims her husband stopped eating after being arrested by police . After . being handcuffed, Mr Hyrons was then sectioned for 28 days at the . Princess of Wales Hospital in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. He was transferred to Park House Nursing Home in Bewedly, Worcs., where he died. The family has now called for police to receive better training for dealing with people with dementia or mental health issues. Mrs Hyrons, from Kidderminster, Worcs., added: 'People in those sort of places are supposed to be looking after dementia sufferers. 'They should know what action to take, the family knew how to control him, although instead of calling us straight away they called the police. 'Officers came round and Keith was still agitated, they brutally restrained him by handcuffing him causing cuts on his wrists - they were way too heavy-handed. 'It was awful, it is a horrible thing to hear about the person you love. 'It is hard for me to imagine the pain he went through on that day, you don’t handcuff a 77-year-old man, it just isn’t right, although the police said they were in their rights to do so. 'There was no need for them to do what they did, it was too much for him, he was clearly confused being in new surroundings and needed to be cared for properly. 'People should know about dementia, it is common nowadays and people should know how to deal with it, not handcuff pensioners. 'I dropped my husband at that place so I could get some rest and they could care for him for a week. 'I wasn’t going to go away for years and years, just a week’s holiday. 'More people need to know about dementia and care home workers and police should be getting better training to deal with sufferers.' A spokesman for West Merica Police said: 'I can confirm we have received a complaint regarding the handling of Mr Hyrons and we are investigating.' Calling for change: Mr Hyrons' family are now calling for more police training on dealing with people with dementia and other mental health issues .","Keith Hyrons, 77, was arrested by police for 'lashing out' at other patients .

A Royal Bahamas Defense Force spokesman says the death toll may reach 30 in the capsizing of a sailboat packed with migrants from Haiti. Lt. Origin Deleveaux says Bahamian authorities have confirmed that at least 20 people died when the boat flipped over near Staniel Cay. Deleveaux tells The Associated Press that five bodies had been recovered by late Tuesday afternoon with the aid of the U.S. Coast Guard. He says they are trying to recover more by nightfall. Interviews with migrants suggest the toll could reach about 30 people. The overloaded sailboat apparently struck a reef and capsized near tiny Harvey Cay, west of Staniel Cay in the Exumas. About 110 were thought to be on the boat, including 19 women. Scroll down for video . At sea: Approximately 100 Haitians sit on the hull of a 40-foot sail freighter after it grounded and capsized and await rescue near the Bahamas in the Caribbean Sea, At least 10 Haitian migrants are reported dead . Risky business: Haitian migrants often head to the Bahamas or pass by on their way to the United States. The US Coast Guard and the Royal Bahamian Defense Force were at the scene . Overloaded: It is not clear whether the migrants were heading to the Bahamas or if their final destination was the US . Low-resolution photos taken by the . U.S. Coast Guard during a rescue operation showed about 100 people on . the boat, clinging to every available space on the overturned vessel . east of Staniel Cay in the Bahamas. The bodies of three of the migrants had been recovered but people on board the vessel said they believe about 30 had drowned, Deleveaux said. The Bahamian Defense Force planned to continue sweeping the area for survivors or the remains of migrants and would then take them to a military base on the island of New Providence, he said. Most will likely eventually be sent back to Haiti. Some of the migrants were treated for dehydration, including about a dozen airlifted from by the U.S. Coast Guard. U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Ryan Doss called the capsizing an 'avoidable tragedy,' that has become common in this area. Dangerous crossing: Fatal accidents at sea involving migrants from Haiti, the Western hemisphere's poorest nation, are not uncommon. In December 2011, 38 migrants were found dead after their boat sank just off the eastern tip of Cuba . No surprise: In 2009, US Coast Guard officials called off their search for about 70 migrants from Haiti whose boat capsized off the Turks and Caicos Islands . Rescue: Dramatic Coast Guard photos from the scene showed the vessel tilted almost completely over on its side, with passengers tightly packed and holding on. Some sat on the gunnels and others climbed the mast . 'Unfortunately we see these types of tragedies occur on a monthly basis,' said Doss, a Coast Guard spokesman. 'Every year we see hundreds of migrants needlessly lose their lives at sea taking part in these dangerous and illegal voyages.' The boat struck ground off Harvey Cay, just weat of Staniel Cay, which is about 80 miles (125 kilometers) southeast of New Providence, the island that includes the capital of Nassau. The boat, in addition to being overloaded, likely encountered rough water, Deleveaux said. Migrants have long passed through the Bahamian archipelago in overloaded vessels, generally either seeking to settle in the Bahamas or reach the nearby United States.","Up to 30 Haitian migrants were killed and rescuers are scrambling to save about 70 more .

Arrested: Wanted fugitive Brian Thexton, 37, has been detained by police in an isolated rural property in Cumbria . One of Britain's most wanted fugitives who is accused of being involved in a string of robberies has been arrested. Brian Thexton, 37, was detained by Cumbria Police at an isolated rural property near Kirkby Stephen shortly before 8pm yesterday. Thexton, from Durham, was recently highlighted by Crimestoppers as one of the country's most wanted fugitives. He is accused of being involved in robberies where a gang would tie up homeowners and force them to give up alarm codes and safe combinations. In one robbery, the gang impersonated police officers to dupe the victims into opening the door, before brandishing a pick axe handle and a baseball bat. Thexton is also awaiting trial for conspiracy to supply cocaine, over claims that he was the middleman in the sale of half a kilo of the drug, and had admitted conspiring to steal cars and machinery. Police had been hunting for the wanted criminal in Lancashire after he was sighted in a car on Aberdeen Road, Lancaster, earlier this month. A police officer told him to pull over, then walked over to the car and reached into the vehicle to remove the keys from the ignition. A Lancashire Police spokesman said the car was then driven away, trapping the officer's arm and dragging him a short distance down the road. The officer freed himself before he was seriously injured.

Five others have been arrested and charged . Daniel Dugic, 32, from Serbia, is accused of trying to smuggle cocaine into the UK. He allegedly plotted a deal where a boat would meet a container ship in the English Channel to collect 255kg of the drug . Police said the car was then driven away at speed and was found a short time later having been set on fire on Fernham Carr Lane. Detective Superintendent Andrew Slattery said last night: 'Detectives from Cumbria Constabulary have worked hard with other police forces in the North of England over recent weeks to track down and arrest Thexton. 'After a uniformed policing operation tonight he was detained without incident at an isolated rural property. 'We would like to thank the community of North Cumbria for their support and can assure them that our county is not and will not become a safe haven for organised criminals.' Thexton was on a list issued by the charity Crimestoppers, the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA), and Spanish police in Madrid earlier this month of 13 of Britain's most wanted criminals thought to be hiding in Spain. The list was published as part of Operation Captura, a scheme to trace criminals who are thought to have fled to Spain.

Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers has broken her own record by having the most children while in office. The 44-year-old Republican welcomed her third child into the world on Sunday, announcing the birth of her daughter Brynn Catherine on Instagram two days later. 'Nothing compares to the miracle of bringing a new life into the world. She's beautiful and seems to be taking it all in stride. Our hearts are full,' she wrote as a caption to the picture of her holding her newborn. New family member: Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers gave birth to Brynn Catherine on Sunday and posted this photo to her public Instagram account two days later . She was elected to Congress in 2004 and represents the eastern district of Washington state that encompasses Spokane. Mrs Rodgers married her husband Brian in August 2006 and eight months later, she had their first child, a son named Cole. After Cole's birth, the couple revealed that he had been diagnosed with Down Syndrome and she has been an advocate for special needs advocacy and launched the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus a month after Cole was born. 'Every parent has hopes and dreams for their child, Down Syndrome is not on the list,' she said in an interview with regional magazine Northwest Woman posted on her Congressional website. Growing brood: The 44-year-old Congresswoman has two other children- her son Cole and daughter Grace- with her husband Brian and is currently in her fourth term representing Washington's 5th district . Professional maternity wear: Mrs McMorris Rodgers worked all through her pregnancy, even putting out a press statement on the final day before the House took their Thanksgiving break (pictured on October 30) 'It is not what we expected, yet we have embraced Cole as the special gift from God that he is. We are developing new dreams for our son and other children with Down Syndrome.' She gave birth to her second child Grace more than two years later in December 2010 and now Brynn Catherine is the latest addition to the growing family. Each of the children were 'record breakers' in a way, because Mrs McMorris Rodgers became the first member of Congress in more than a decade to give birth while in office when she had Cole. Grace then set her over another edge by making her the first Congresswoman to give birth twice while in office, and now Brynn has set the bar even higher. Front and center: She has been gaining more and more recognition in the Republican party and played a pivotal role during the budget negotiations and ensuing shutdown . She appears to have stayed active at work until the very last minute, putting out a press release about the passage of a gas pipeline reform act on Thursday which was the last day Congress was in session before the Thanksgiving break. They will not return to the chambers until Monday December 2 and they will have two four-day weeks before taking off for the Christmas holidays. Calls to the Congresswoman's office about the expected length of her maternity leave were not immediately returned.","Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, 44, gave birth to her third child .

This is the moment the president and COO of discount chain Family Dollar is fired during an episode of television show ‘Undercover Boss.’ Michael Bloom was fired by a warehouse supervisor because he was unable to safely operate a forklift. Rosali, a supervisor and forklift operator in a Virginia warehouse, fired a man he thought was named Mark. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'I have to let you go': Rosali (left) fired Mr Bloom (right) for incompetence after only a few hours . 'Mark,' as Mr Bloom was called, told Family Dollar employees he was on a reality show competing for his own business. Forklift operator was one of a handful of jobs ‘Mark’ undertook within the company while on the CBS show. He made multiple mistakes with the forklift that put multiple people in danger. From blowing through stop signals to ignoring other safeguards, ‘Mark’ was a terrible forklift operator. ‘Mark, I gotta tell you this,’ Rosali said to the covert COO. ‘I wouldn’t be comfortable leaving you alone doing this.’ ‘I will have to, you know, let you go,’ he continued. Woah, easy!: 'Mark' clumsily operates the forklift, causing Rosali to tell him to be more gentle . Stop signs are not suggestive: 'Mark' also blew through a stop sign - a big no no . 'Test drive': 'Mark's troubles begin shortly after takes the reigns of the forklift . The astonished exec was almost speechless being fired for a low-level position from the company he runs on national television. ‘Just for that… I get fired for one little mistake,’ said ‘Mark.’ ‘Yeah,’ Rosali confirmed. Rosali further defended his decision in a follow up interview added to the broadcast. ‘I have to fire Mark for safety reasons,’ he said. ‘I don’t want him to have an accident or hurt anybody else.’ A stern warning: 'Mark' was only at the controls a few minutes before receiving his first warning . If only he knew: Rosali did not know 'Mark' was actually Mr Bloom as he fired him in this scene . Wait, what?: Rosali fired 'Mark' for incompetence before even finishing his first day . Water under the bridge: Mr Bloom offered to pay off $12,000 in debt and gave Rosali a promotion with a 40 per cent raise . The banished boss was surprisingly upbeat about being booted from the warehouse. ‘It’s a little embarrassing, but I’m glad to see that he takes safety so seriously,’ he said during his walk of shame. Mr Bloom revealed himself to Rosali later in the episode. He showed no ill will towards the man for firing him. The bigwig offered to pay off two-thirds of Rosali’s $18,000 credit card debt and promoted him to a salaried managerial position with a 40 per cent pay raise. ‘Thank you, I’ll do my best, I can do it,’ Rosali said. ‘I know you can,’ Mr Bloom replied. Mr Bloom has been the president and COO of Family Dollar since 2011. His total compensation last year came out to just over $3.5million, according to Bloomberg.","Family Dollar president and COO Mike Bloom went on 'Undercover Boss' and was fired .

The popularity of programmes such as Masterchef and The Great British Bake Off may be soaring but many Brits watch top cooks at work while eating a bowl of cereal or beans on toast for dinner, according to a survey. While we may admire the work of Michel Roux Jnr and Mary Berry, their shows don't seem to inspire viewers to cook. A study of 1,000 adults in the UK found that cooking programmes rank among our favourite to watch, but one in four people still eat cereal for their dinner at least once a week. Interest: Shows such as Masterchef, above, have soared in popularity but many home cooks do not take inspiration from Michel Roux Jnr, centre . More than a third of adults now describe . themselves as a ‘foodie’, but despite that claim, almost half have just . a handful of meals that they cook during the working week. Many regularly resorting to basic pasta for their dinner. The survey, conducted by frozen fod company Birdseye, found that Brits watch an average of 121 hours of food programmes on TV every year and own an average of nine recipe books. However, despite this interest in all things to do with food, 33 per cent of those polled admitted to eating the same dinner at least twice a week half said they only have a handful of ‘go-to’ meals that they cook week after week. Researchers found 36 per cent of respondents now consider themselves a 'foodie' . Not time to bake: Respondents in the survey said they simply had no time to follow complex recipes, the likes of which are shown by Mary Berry onthe Great British Bake Off . But 40 per cent of Brits are still too tired to think about cooking a proper meal at the end of the day. According to the findings, the average Brit has a repertoire of six midweek meals. The study identified these as dishes they prepare and serve in less than 30 minutes. Pasta was the most popular 'go-to' dinner, followed by a jacket potato, stir-fry and beans on toast. The glamorous dishes which are shown on screens may have inspired culinary ambition, with half saying they wished they could serve up more exciting meals for their family. But, when asked what was the reason behind their lack of adventure in the kitchen, long working hours and never having the right ingredients to hand were popular responses. Helen Martin, general marketing manager at Birds Eye, said: 'Foodie programmes and celebrity cook books are a national obsession, but many of us simply don’t have the time to try our hand at recreating delicious meals for ourselves at the end of a long working day. 'As our lives are becoming increasingly busy and time is such a precious commodity, it is clear to see from the research that we’re reaching for products we can trust to create great tasting enjoyable nutritious meals quickly and easily. 'It’s all too easy to get stuck in a recipe rut and find yourself eating the same meal several times in a fortnight simply out of a sense of routine.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:44 EST, 26 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:00 EST, 26 November 2013 . A Connecticut judge has ruled that the 911 recordings from Sandy Hook Elementary School will be released publicly even though the parents of the slain students pushed for them to be sealed. The recordings, which capture the horrific moments when last December’s attack unfolded, are scheduled to be released on December 4- just ten days before the first anniversary. The state's Freedom of Information Commission ruled in September that the recordings should be provided to The Associated Press, but State's Attorney Stephen Sedensky III asked for a stay while he appeals that order. Heartbreaking: The judge ruled that the 911 calls should be released because they will be used to vindicate the actions of the emergency responders who arrived at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012 . The prosecutor still does have the chance to appeal the release, which was announced on Tuesday afternoon. 'The court recognizes and is deeply sensitive to the fact that the families and friends of those who died in this tragedy, as well as others in the greater Newtown community, may desire that the 911 audio recordings never be released,' New Britain Superior Court Judge Eliot Prescott wrote. 'The public airing by the media of some or all of the recordings that will undoubtedly follow their release will likely be a searing reminder of the horror and pain of that awful day.' But the judge said the recordings are public, and he rejected arguments for keeping them sealed. Shattered window: Almost a year since the shooting, Connecticut State Police has released crime scene pictures including the one above, which shows the shattered front entrance of Sandy Hook Elementary School . The harrowing image above shows damage done inside the front entrance at Sandy Hook Elementary School following the December 14, 2012 shooting rampage . He said that the release will help the public gauge the appropriateness of law enforcement's response. The mind of a killer: A new report revealed how Adam Lanza kept spreadsheets comparing mass killings and only communicated with his mother via email . 'In . fact, public analysis of the recordings may serve to vindicate and . support the professionalism and bravery of the first responders... who . themselves have undoubtedly been subject to emotional turmoil and pain . in witnessing the scene at Sandy Hook Elementary School,' Prescott . wrote. 'Delaying the release of the audio recordings, particularly where the legal justification to keep them confidential is lacking, only serves to fuel speculation about and undermine confidence in our law enforcement officials.' The AP has sought the recordings in part to examine the police response to the massacre, which left 20 first-graders and six educators dead. If the recordings are released, the AP would review the content and determine what, if any, of it would meet the news cooperative's standards for publication. The announcement about the release of the tapes comes one day after a new collection of crime scene photos were made public, showing how shooter Adam Lanza taped over his bedroom windows with garbage bags. Adam Lanza's bedroom, pictured, was bare with black plastic garbage bags taped to the windows . In this handout crime scene evidence photo provided by the Connecticut State Police, shows firearms and ammunition found on or in close proximity to shooters body at Sandy Hook Elementary School following the December 14, 2012 shooting rampage . The explosive 44-page report offers a detailed look at the massacre that rocked the nation but no motive could be established. Lanza, 20, was obsessed with Columbine and other mass murders and drove by the Newtown, Connecticut school the day before his heartbreaking rampage. He also plotted his own death by watching videos of suicides and had taken pictures of himself holding a rifle and separately a handgun to his head. Questions are being raised about the relationship between the boy and his mother, because even though friends say she would have done anything for her son, they exhibited some unusual behavior which was unearthed in the investigation. They would communicate via email even though they lived in the same house, and she would never check his room- which he would not allow- even though she knew he was not taking his psychological medication and had an affinity for guns. Lanza's fascination with violence was apparent to teachers and other acquaintances. He collected materials on mass killings and kept a spreadsheet ranking of mass murders. Lanza, 20, shot his mother in the head four times Dec. 14, then drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School, where he killed 20 first-graders and six women with a semi-automatic rifle. He committed suicide as police arrived. Nancy Lanza, who was divorced from Adam's father, indicated that she did not work because of her son's condition. In their spacious Newtown home, she catered to his requests, cooking to his specifications and getting rid of a cat because he did not want it in the house. She often took her soon shooting at a gun range. She legally purchased all of the weapons that her son carried the day of the massacre, and she had written a check to buy him a pistol for Christmas. A friend of Nancy Lanza's, Marvin LaFontaine, said that she was a devoted mother to her two sons and that she showed up at Adam's elementary school to protect him when he was picked on by other children. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, said Nancy Lanza did not ignore her son's psychological problems and cannot be blamed for his actions. 'She was a victim, not an accessory,' he said. 'We can easily second-guess parents, and there's a lot there we can question, but the fact of the matter is many people commit horrible crimes despite the best efforts of parents, siblings and others.'","Tapes were originally planned to be sealed but that ruling was overturned .

Charged: Robert Kerns, 66, pictured, a married father of three, faces 19 criminal counts, including charges of rape, sexual assault, tampering with evidence, and lying to authorities . The ex-boss of a Pennsylvania county's Republican Party has been charged with drugging a female colleague and then raping her while she was unconscious. Robert Kerns, 66, a married father of three, faces 19 criminal counts, including charges of rape, sexual assault, tampering with evidence, and lying to authorities. He resigned from his position at Montgomery County's Republican Party branch this month, after the alleged attack against a 51-year-old part-time employee at his Lansdale law firm on October 25. 'I give great credit to the victim in this case,' Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman told reporters at a news conference Tuesday in Norristown. 'She was extremely courageous in coming forward.' The alleged victim, who began working at Kerns, Pearlstine, Onorato & Hladik in October 2012, has not been identified and has not returned to work since the alleged rape. Kerns' lawyer said his client 'vehemently denies' the allegations and he was expected to be released Tuesday after posting 10 per cent of $1 million bail. According to Philly.com, the firm had a 'post-workday celebration party' at Radice restaurant in Whitpain Township on October 25, in honor of a firm attorney passing the Pennsylvania Bar Exam. There, the alleged victim told colleagues she planned to go shopping at the King of Prussia Mall after the event but because she had been drinking, she didn't feel she should drive. Kerns allegedly offered to give her a ride to the mall, but before he left the restaurant he bought a screw-top bottle of Chardonnay and asked for two wine glasses to take with him, the bartender told authorities. The pair left the restaurant in Kerns' Mercedes at around 6 p.m., prosecutors said. In the car, he asked the woman to pour two glasses of wine from the already opened bottle and she obliged, not knowing the wine had already been laced with Ambien by Kerns, prosecutors said. Colleague: The alleged victim was a 51-year-old part-time employee at his Lansdale law firm, pictured . 'At some point between the time she drank the wine provided by Kerns and lost consciousness and the time she regained her memory as they entered her neighborhood, the victim has a vague memory of her head up against the car window and pushing Kerns away,' the grand jury report said. When they got to her house, Kerns allegedly helped her inside and collapsed on her bed before assaulting her again. The woman didn't return to work the next day and on October 27 she went to Grand View Hospital in Sellersville for blood and urine tests and an internal examination, Philly.com reported. Her urine showed the presence of Ambien, which she said she had never taken. She was sent for further tests to determine if she had been sexually assaulted. On October 31, she reported the alleged rape to Upper Merion Police. Kerns turned himself in on Tuesday morning, following weeks of rumors. He had already resigned from his party position November 14. 'It's a very sad day,' former county commissioner James R. Matthews told Philly.com. 'I've known Bob for a very long time, and it's a sad time for his family and his firm . . . and the alleged victim.' Kerns had served as the party chairman since 2008.","Robert Kerns, 66, is the former boss of the Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, Republican Party .

A 42-year-old man who sued Metro for 'slipping on a banana peel' in a Washington station elevator has been charged with fraud after a video shows him planting the slippery skin and purposely tripping himself over. Maurice Owens, from District Heights, tripped over one night at about 9pm on August 8 as he walked out of an elevator at the busy Potomac Avenue station, saying he fell from a banana peel left on the floor and injured his hip and leg, according to The Washington Post. He sued the transit agency for $15,000, part of which was for a $4,500 chiropractor bill. However a recently-found surveillance tape has showed Owens was a victim of his own making. Scroll down for video . Candid camera: Metro officials deem this shot from the elevator camera on August 8 is the most important, because it shows there is nothing on the floor . Maurice Owens then enters and there is still nothing on the floor . Sprung!: After a few seconds, Owens moves as a way from his position by the elevator door, showing that a banana peel has suddenly materialized on the floor . Yes, you're being recorded: Maurice Owens starts to look around for security cameras and finds one, which will eventually be the key to his undoing . The footage clearly shows that the elevator was empty when Owens walked in. While it does not clearly show him placing the peel on the ground, you can see movements with his hands and pockets. When he steps away from the door while still traveling in the elevator the banana skin can be seen. But perhaps the most incriminating piece of footage is a part where Owens starts to search for a security camera - and then looks worryingly straight at it. As the doors open, Owens is sure to step exactly on the skin and then falls forward, before quickly getting up. The all-important exit: As the doors open, Maurice Owens is careful to step directly on the banana peel while walking out . Woops!: Owens slips and trips while get out of the elevator . Splat: Owens ends up on the floor, with the banana peel being thrown back inside the elevator (right) Thanks to the video, the Metro claim has now been thrown out and Owens has subsequently been charged with second-degree fraud. 'Through our investment in digital camera systems across the system, we are demonstrating our commitment to protecting fare-paying riders and the region’s taxpayers from fraudulent claims,' Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said. Owens reported his injuries to the station manager straight away, with Metro Transit Police called. Owens was then taken to Howard University Hospital for treatment. Two weeks later he filed a lawsuit. In an interview with Metro officials, Owens had reportedly asked why a custodian for the station had 'not cleaned up the banana peel prior to his entering the elevator', according to the police report. 'What you will see in the camera footage is that the elevator, just prior to Mr. Owens boarding, shows there’s nothing on the floor,' Stessel said. The elevator incident occurred here, at the busy Potomac Avenue Metro station in central Washington . 'He is then seen with what appears to be a banana peel in his hand, looking in the direction of the camera,' Stessel said. 'An object can be seen on the ground, and then when the elevator doors open, he steps on the object, thrusts himself forward and falls out of the elevator.' Metro presented its case to the U.S. attorney’s office. A warrant was issued accusing Owens of fraud and he was arrested. At a hearing this month, a D.C. Superior Court judge ordered Owens to have a mental-health screening and evaluation. He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday. The case is one of the roughly 225 claims Metro’s Third Party Claims office receives each month. Most seek compensation for slips and falls on station platforms, stairs, escalators, elevators and buses, or while getting on and off trains. Oldest trick in the book: Banana peels are notoriously slippery . Fewer than half of those claims result in a settlement from Metro, and the average payout is less than $2,500, Stessel said. Over the past few years the agency paid $50 to a Metro rider who said oil dripped from a rail car’s air conditioner onto his shirt; $45 to a rider who claimed to have gotten his sandal stuck in an escalator at West Falls Church; $104.37 to a driver who said the gate at the West Falls Church parking garage came down on his vehicle; and $100 to a person who said he lost his footing while walking down steps at the Branch Avenue Metro station. Stessel noted that Metro sometimes opens its own claims. 'For example, if a person gets transported to the hospital, we will automatically open a claim,' he said. 'If the person never gets in touch with us, it is classified as ''abandoned''.'","Maurice Owens, 43, filed a lawsuit against the Potomac Avenue Metro station in August after claiming he fell on a banana peel while exiting an elevator and injured his hip and leg .

The boyfriend of an Arkansas police dispatcher who was killed nearly two years ago has been arrested in Colorado and charged with first-degree murder. Kevin Duck, 30, is accused of killing Dawna Natzke, a Hot Springs Village police dispatcher who was last seen leaving a holiday party with Duck around 11pm on December 21, 2011. Volunteer searchers found her body on New Year's Eve in a remote area of the Ouachita National Forest, about 5 miles from where her burned-out station wagon had been found days earlier. Justice for Dawna: Officials in Colorado arrested Kevin Duck, 30 (left), and charged him with first-degree murder in connection to the December 2011 killing of his girlfriend, Dawna Natzke, 46 (right) On Tuesday, Garland County Sheriff's Lt. James Martin said Duck was arrested without incident in the Burlington, Colorado, area. He is being held on $250,000 bond. According to Duck's arrest warrant, Dawna Natzke likely died from blunt force trauma and drowning three or four hours after leaving the party with her boyfriend. The FBI has been able to determine that Duck used his cell phone in the area where Natzke's body and burned out vehicle were dumped just 30 minutes apart. Natzke, 46, had worked at the police station seven years. At age 35, she donated a kidney to her father, prolonging his life by 10 years, according to the preacher at her funeral. Friends said she built her life around her sons: two who played football at Jessieville High School at the time of her death and an older son who lived nearly. Searching: Volunteers found Dawna's body December 31, 2011, in a remote area of the Ouachita National Forest 5 miles from where her burned-out vehicle . Duck told detectives in 2011 that the couple returned to Natzke's home after the holiday party and that she was gone when he awoke the next morning. ‘The best we know, he was just angry with her, when they left the party he was just angry,’ Oliver said.The two had arrived at the party together, along with Natzke's mother, in Natzke's car, according to Oliver. Person of interest: Duck, seen here in a mugshot in an unrelated probation case, wasn't initially named a suspect in Natzke's death, but his own father said he was the 'only person of interest' ‘She was seen leaving with Mr. Duck. He was kind of leading her out. He wasn't pushing her, just kind of leading her out’ he said. ‘She left her mother behind and her purse.’ A friend, Patty Hathaway, told The Associated Press in early 2012 that, shortly after Natzke's disappearance, she had received an odd text message from the woman's phone. Hathaway said she had texted Natzke the day after the party to say she wasn't pleased with how Natzke's boyfriend had ‘pushed’ her out the door. Nearly two hours later, Hathaway . received a text from Natzke's phone, saying: ‘He didn't push me i fell . and he caught me. I had taken a pain pill and was tour up.’ Hathaway said she didn't believe Natzke wrote the message. ‘I know she knows how to spell,’ she said then. Natzke's disappearance went unreported . until December 23, when she didn't show up for her 6am shift in what . would have been her first day back at work after the party. Duck's arrest warrant cited by ABC News stated that the 30-year-old came to work at a car service station late the next day after his girlfriend’s disappearance and took little interest in searching for her. Luther Duck, Kevin's father, told KATV . last February that his son was 'the only person of interest' in the . case, and suggested that it was only a matter of time before he is . brought to justice. Suspicious: Patty Hathaway (right) said that shortly after Natzke's disappearance, she had received an odd text message from her friend's phone, which led her to believe the sender was not Dawna .

The future of the proposed high-speed rail link between San Francisco and Los Angeles is in jeopardy after a judge on Monday tore up California's funding plans for what would be the nation's first bullet train. Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Michael Kenny's decision could force the state to spend months or years redrawing its plans for the $68 billion rail line and could choke off some of its funding. Judge Kenny rejected a request from the California High-Speed Rail Authority to sell $8 billion of the $10 billion in bonds approved by voters in 2008, saying there was no evidence it was 'necessary and desirable' to start selling the bonds when a committee of state officials met last March. An artist's rendering of a high-speed train speeding along the California coast: The state's. California's ambitious bullet train project has hit the buffers after a judge tore up the proposed plans for how to fund the $68billion project . He said the committee, which included state Treasurer Bill Lockyer, was supposed to act as 'the ultimate ""keeper of the checkbook'"" for taxpayers, but instead relied on a request from the high-speed rail authority to start selling bonds as sufficient evidence to proceed. In a separate lawsuit, Kenny ordered the rail authority to redo its $68 billion funding plan, a process that could take months or years, although rail authority officials say they have already started and believe it can be done much more quickly than that. He had previously ruled that the authority abused its discretion by approving a funding plan that did not comply with the law. The judge said the state failed to identify 'sources of funds that were more than merely theoretically possible.' The decision taken on Monday by Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Michael Kenny could force the state to spend months or years redrawing its plans . It is also unclear who will decide if . the new funding plan is sufficient. It will be submitted to the board . that oversees the rail line, whose members have been appointed by Gov. Jerry Brown, a project booster, and the Democrat-controlled Legislature. Proposition . 1A, which voters approved in 2008, required the rail authority to . specify the source of the funding for the first operable segment of the . high-speed rail line and have all the necessary environmental clearances . in place. Kenny had said the agency did not comply with either mandate in approving the start of construction from Madera to Fresno, about 30 miles. The plaintiffs, a group of Central Valley residents and farmers, believe the requirement applies to the first 300 miles stretching as far as Bakersfield with a projected price tag of $31 billion. But the rail authority contends it applies only to the first 'useable' segment of track in the Central Valley. 'The court said, look, you've only got 28 miles with completed environmental clearances. I order that you have to have 300 miles of environmental clearances,' said Michael Brady, an attorney for residents who had sued to halt the project. 'It's taken them five years to do 28 miles, so how long will it take them to do 300 miles?' An artist's rendering of a high-speed train station: California's plan had been scheduled to be the nation's first bullet train . Still, Kenny stopped short of blocking the project altogether, and rail authority officials characterized Monday's rulings as a setback rather than a fatal blow. 'Like all transformative projects, we understand that there will be many challenges that will be addressed as we go forward in building the nation's first high-speed rail system,' rail authority Chairman Dan Richard said in a written statement. The authority's CEO, Jeff Morales, disagreed with claims by the opponents that the judge's rulings would send high-speed rail planners back to the drawing board, saying officials are confident they can address the judge's concerns quickly. When asked how much time it could take, he said, 'Not long. We don't think that addressing that will have any material effect on the project.' The rail authority had argued that it has already updated its funding plan and that it intends to spend $3.2 billion in federal money before tapping the state bonds. It also argued that only the Legislature could intervene to stop the project. The plaintiffs had also asked Kenny to block spending of the federal funds and rescind construction contracts, including a $1 billion deal signed this fall, but the judge declined to do so Monday, saying there was no evidence 'that there has been any impropriety' in spending. John Tos, a Hanford farmer and the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit to block the sale of bonds to build California's bullet train, talks with reporters after a hearing in the case in Sacramento County Superior Court on Monday . He also did not invalidate the bonds, merely saying that officials would need to present more evidence about why they need to be sold and when before the committee should approve the sales. But without authorization to sell bonds, the bullet train's financing sources could dry up. California has already issued more than $705 million in Proposition 1A bonds, about $400 million for high-speed rail and about $305 million for related rail-improvement projects that could eventually be connected. The plans have changed significantly since voters approved the train, along with the costs - from $45 billion in 2008 to more than $100 billion in 2011 and, now, $68 billion for a 520-mile line connecting San Francisco and greater Los Angeles through the Central Valley. Political considerations and opposition by local residents statewide have also forced repeated changes. Jon Coupal, executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which had sued over the bonds, blamed the ever-changing plans for the judge's decisions Monday. 'The project now is so divergent from what the voters were told that I don't think he had any other choice,' Coupal said.","Judge Michael Kenny's decision could force the state to spend months or years redrawing its plans for the $68 billion rail line .

It is often said that people from North America are obsessed with British culture because the history of the U.S. and Canada is relatively short. But one Canadian family has taken their taste for the UK's past to the extreme and moved to England so that they could visit every historic site in the country. David and Rosemary Ross are so passionate about the country's history they decided to uproot from British Columbia, Canada, to Upper Rissington in Gloucestershire, 10 years ago. Since then, they have visited over 2,000 castles, monasteries, battlefields and monuments with their children Garett, 19, and Claire, 13.

Andrea Green, 42, died 14 hours after routine surgery for her back pain, which may have been unnecessary . A patient bled to death following the 'gross failure' of a doctor to give her a life-saving blood transfusion before it was too late. Andrea Green, 42, died 14 hours after a routine operation for back pain, which may have been unnecessary, an inquest heard. Consultant surgeon Hany Ismaiel accidentally cut an artery during the operation and staff at Barnsley District Hospital failed to pick up on subsequent internal bleeding. Locum senior house officer Dr Oluwatosin Taiwo, who trained in Nigeria, failed to act 'promptly and efficiently' to give her a transfusion, according to a coroner. The medic knew Miss Green had suffered a ‘massive blood loss’ but instead of giving her the transfusion when blood became ready he called for more tests. In delivering her findings, assistant Sheffield coroner Siobhan Kelly said: ‘It was a gross failure of basic medical attention for the doctor not to ensure the blood transfusion took place as soon as possible after the blood was ready. Had he done so Andrea Green would have lived.’ In her verdict, Ms Kelly said neglect contributed to Miss Green’s death at Barnsley District Hospital on March 13 2010 in that the transfusion should have been given more quickly. The inquest heard Dr Taiwo had only been working at the hospital for a week-and-a-half and did not have full orthopaedic experience. He no longer works there. Although he became aware of the blood loss at 11.40pm he ‘did not appreciate the severity of the situation’ and gave no instructions for close observations on Miss Green. The coroner said after receiving a low haemoglobin reading he ‘should have been pushing every panic button available’. Blood was ready to collect at 11.55pm but was not picked up until 1.10am the next day and the transfusion only started at 1.25am. ‘Even then she was left by herself and without any care as she was found alone and fitting at 1.35am,’ said the coroner. Miss Green then went into cardiac arrest and it was too late to save her life. ‘Had a blood transfusion been started as soon as possible after the bloods were available Andrea Green would have lived,’ the coroner said. Administrator Miss Green, of Carlton, Barnsley, who had two degrees and was studying for a third in engineering, suffered back pain which often left her bedridden. She was told if she did not have an operation on a prolapsed disc the pain could return. She opted for surgery but Mr Ismaiel got the wrong disc, pierced it and ruptured an artery which went unnoticed and she began bleeding. Ms Kelly outlined a catalogue of errors which had been made during her treatment. She said it was ‘wholly unclear’ why Mr Ismaiel did not refer Miss Green for physiotherapy rather than have an operation as surgery was ‘not inevitable’ in her case. The surgeon did damage the artery during the operation with an instrument but it was not clear how it was caused. Locum senior house officer Dr Oluwatosin Taiwo, who trained in Nigeria, failed to act 'promptly and efficiently' to give her a transfusion, at Barnsley District Hospital . Although Miss Green’s blood pressure dropped twice during the operation and in recovery this information was not passed on to nursing staff. The nurses did not realise the significance of the haemoglobin reading and anaesthetist Dr David Kershaw failed to inform Mr Ishmaiel as he should have done. A trainee nurse inserted a wrong entry in an early warning chart which could have alerted doctors to the situation and observations were not carried out as confusion reigned over who was responsible. Handovers of staff were ‘wholly inadequate’, said the coroner, and nurses assumed Miss Green was a ‘routine’ patient. Dr Taiwo was unaware of the low haemoglobin reading until he got the results of an earlier blood test. Miss Green’s death came just weeks after consultants in the orthopaedic department warned management of the ‘grave risks’ to patient safety because of staffing levels. But the coroner ruled that the breakdown in relations had no effect on the care given to Miss Green. ‘The errors which led to Andrea Green’s death arose because of personal errors and not as a result of any systems failure,’ she said. Deficiencies in her care had been investigated by the hospital trust and ‘significant and effective’ changes had been put in place. Hany Ismaiel (pictured) cut an artery during the operation and subsequent internal bleeding was not picked up . The coroner said she could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any of the many errors identified contributed to the death. ‘I cannot find that the actions of any of the clinicians was so bad that it amounted to a criminal act or omission deserving of punishment,’ she said. Miss Green’s family have already settled out of court with the hospital’s trust for a six-figure sum for medical negligence. Afterwards, Andrew Harrison, head of medical negligence at Raleys Solicitors of Barnsley said: ‘We would expect the General Medical Council to look at this case further to ensure no one else has to go through an ordeal like this. ‘It was extremely difficult for the Green family to hear the number of failures which led to Andrea’s death but hopefully important lessons have been learned.’ A Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust spokesman apologised to the family for the ‘deficiencies in care’ which contributed to Miss Green’s death. ‘The trust has sought to learn appropriate lessons to ensure that such a tragic event never happens again,’ he said.","Andrea Green, 42, died 14 hours after routine surgery for back pain .

An ancient pocket of seawater has been discovered deep underground in Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, and provides hints at what the world's oceans were like during the time of the dinoaurs. The sample is thought to be 100 to 150 million years old and suggests that the Atlantic was once twice as salty as it is now. The water contains chloride and bromide . as well as other chemicals which helped the scientists age it to the . Early Cretaceous Period. The water is thought to date back 150 million years, when the Acrocanthosaurus roamed Early Cretaceous North America (CGI of dinosaur, pictured) The Cretaceous Period refers to the state of the Earth 142 million to 65 million years ago. It ended with the greatest mass extinction in history - the entire planet's dinosaurs died out. It is thought that a giant asteroid impact caused the mass extinction. Prior to this, the Earth was warm with no ice caps at the poles. Much of what we now know as dry land - . such as southern England and the midwest of the USA was underwater, . since sea levels reached their highest ever during this time. The . Atlantic Ocean grew much wider as North and South America drew apart . from Europe and Africa. The Indian Ocean was formed at this time, and . the island that was India began its journey north towards Asia. While older water has been discovered in Canada, the Chesapeake Bay water that sits more than half a mile underground is now thought to be the oldest large body of water known on the planet. 'Previous evidence for temperature and salinity levels of geologic-era oceans around the globe have been estimated indirectly from various types of evidence in deep sediment cores,' said Ward Sanford, a United States Geological Survey research hydrologist and lead author of the investigation. 'In contrast, our study identifies ancient seawater that remains in place in its geologic setting, enabling us to provide a direct estimate of its age and salinity.' Scientists have described the finding as 'like a fly trapped in amber', which was trapped by the aid of a massive comet or meteorite impact that struck the area about 35 million years ago, creating Chesapeake Bay. The largest crater discovered in the U.S., the Chesapeake Bay impact crater is one of only a few oceanic impact craters that have been documented worldwide. The largest crater discovered in the U.S., the Chesapeake Bay impact crater is one of only a few oceanic impact craters that have been documented worldwide. Scientists have described the finding as 'like a fly trapped in amber'. It is thought to have been trapped by the aid of impact of a massive meteorite (CGI pictured) About 35 million years ago a huge rock or chunk of ice traveling through space blasted a 56-mile-wide hole in the shallow ocean floor near what is now the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The force of the impact ejected enormous amounts of debris into the atmosphere and spawned a train of gigantic tsunamis that probably reached as far as the Blue Ridge Mountains, more than 110 miles away. The impact of the comet or meteorite would have deformed and broken up the existing arrangement of aquifers - water bearing rocks - and confining units - layers of rock that restrict the flow of groundwater. Virginia's 'inland saltwater wedge' is a well-known phenomenon that is thought to be related to the impact crater. The outer rim of the crater appears to coincide with the boundary separating salty and fresh groundwater. 'We knew from previous observations that there is deep groundwater in quite a few areas in the Atlantic Coastal Plain around the Chesapeake Bay that have salinities higher than seawater,' said Jerad Bales, acting USGS Associate Director for Water. 'Various theories related to the crater impact have been developed to explain the origin of this high salinity. But, up to this point, no one thought that this was North Atlantic Ocean water that had essentially been in place for about 100 million years.' 'This study gives us confidence that we are working directly with seawater that dates far back in Earth’s history,' Bales continued. 'The study also has heightened our understanding of the geologic context of the Chesapeake Bay region as it relates to improving our understanding of hydrology in the region.' Groundwater found bubbling up from nearly two miles beneath the surface of Canada may predate the emergence of multicellular life, but it certainly doesn't taste great, a leading scientist claimed earlier this year. A joint British and Canadian team discovered the ancient pockets of water, which they say are like 'trapped time capsules' cut off from the surface for as long as three billion years. Barbara Sherwood Lollar, an Earth sciences professor at the University of Toronto, who was studying the water, described it as tasting 'terrible' after feeling compelled to take a sip. The water, that is still being studied, could be some of the oldest on the planet and may even contain life as it contains an abundance of chemicals known to support organisms in the absence of sunlight. More exciting still, the similarity between the rocks that trapped it and those on Mars raises the hope that comparable life sustaining water could be locked deep beneath the surface of the Red Planet. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, she said that what jumps out at you first is the saltiness. She said: 'Because of the reactions between the water and the rock, it is extremely salty. 'It is more viscous than tap water. It has the consistency of a very light maple syrup. It doesn't have colour when it comes out, but as soon as it comes into contact with oxygen it turns an orangy colour because the minerals in it begin to form — especially the iron.' She added that 'you would definitely not want to drink this stuff'.","Water was discovered deep underground in Chesapeake Bay, in Virgina .

Staff at a bar where a woman announced her plans to divorce her cheating husband on a public sign are urging the man to come forward to tell his side of the story. Noah's Yard in Swansea, south Wales, were happy to oblige when a scorned woman asked them to name and shame her spouse who, she discovered, was having an affair with his yoga teacher. Now, nosy local residents are trying to entice the man into having his say, with a new sign reading: 'Coming soon: Paul's story'. Staff at Noah's Yard in Swansea are urging Paul to come forward with his side of the story after his wife publicly announced her plans to divorce him . Last week the bar put up a message from the man's heartbroken wife that read: 'Paul I am divorcing you.' A later one informed him: 'BTW I am keeping the dog.' The . woman, who wants to remain anonymous, was 'devastated' to learn . her husband was having an affair, and vengefully decided to publicly . humiliate him. Though a friend claims the man is 'furious' with his wife's actions, he is reluctant to come forward amid all the local gossip. But Noah's Yard staff are hoping to entice him out of the woodwork as 'everyone wants to know what he looks like.' 'It's his own fault, you could argue, he did apparently cheat on his wife,' said bar owner Noah Redfern. 'But we want him to come in, we're intrigued. 'Obviously this puts a bit of pressure on him,' he added. The man's wife has been left 'terribly upset' by the ordeal which has seen an end to their marriage. Shock: An angry wife persuaded staff at nightspot Noah's Yard in Swansea's Uplands district to put up the sign reading 'Paul... I am divorcing you' above the door . Anger: The sign expressing her wife for a divorce was followed up with a statement revealing she was keeping the couple's dog . 'I was angry and upset so wanted a sign to go up for everyone to see,' she told the  South Wales Evening Post. 'When I found out I went through a mixture of emotions but felt angry and wanted him to pay. 'I had a drink in the bar on Tuesday and decided to get my own back. 'We have been married for years and it is so sad it has come to this. 'I am absolutely devastated and going through a really tough time at the moment. 'A lot of my friends and family have seen it and have been supporting me. 'I did feel a bit better once the sign went up. I wanted to name and shame him.' Linda . Davies, who lives close to the bar, said: 'Good on her. If my husband . ever cheated on me then I would string him up by his privates. Kimmie Powell, 24, and Noah Redfern, 35, of Noah's Yard are urging Paul to come forward to tell his side of the story . 'Maybe he thought he could get away with sleeping around but I bet he is regretting it now.' Passerby Ron Williams said it would keep a lot of men in the area on their toes. He said: 'I would be mortified if that ever happened to me. 'This could give a lot of wives in the city an idea - I'm guessing there will be a few nervous husbands walking down the street today.' Noah’s Yard changes the words on its sign on a regular basis, often displaying statements such as 'Go Wales' for rugby matches. The bar once had a romantic proposal emblazoned above the entrance, coincidentally reading 'Marry Me Paul', though it is not thought the two men are the same.","Staff at Noah's Yard Jazz Bar are appealing to mysterious man .

It was a brazen daylight heist that saw a lone raider make off with jewels worth around £88million from the French RIviera's most glamorous hotel and which has left detectives clueless. And four months on, the first CCTV images of a daring heist at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes have emerged as police still hunt the culprit. Staff are pictured cowering in terror as the gunman, dressed in shorts and a dark baseball cap strolls into the hotel, threatens security guards and walks out with a haul of extraordinarily expensive Chopard jewellery. The robbery, one of the biggest jewel heists in history, is over in less than 30 seconds. Brazen: The thief, bottom right of the picture, threatens staff with a handgun as he makes off with £88million of jewels from the Carlton Hotel in Cannes . Caught on camera: The thief threatens one worker with a gun while a woman sobs into her hands in fear during the raid . Terror: The thief is seen strolling from the hotel with a bag and box of jewels with staff still cowering in fear behind him . The CCTV images were published by French newspaper Nice Matin after police finally agree to publish them in an effort to catch the thief. The jewels, which belonged to London-based Israeli billionaire Lev Leviev, had been due to go on display at the luxury hotel when the man walked in through open patio doors. The footage shows staff unpacking necklaces, rings and brooches as three security guards stand nearby, one of them pacing the room. One of the guards begins to move from his spot presumably having seen the thief enter through the doors but stops in his tracks and puts his hands up when the man points a handgun at him. Preparing for display: Staff are seen unloading some of the jewels from a bag into a display case as security guards look on . Powerless: A security guard puts his hands up when the thief calmly walks through the patio doors and threatens him with a gun . Get on the floor: The guard then cowers on the ground as the thief stands over him brandishing his weapon . Alert: Staff who are busy unpacking the jewels become aware that a raid is taking place as they watch the first guard cower on the ground when he is threatened with a gun . The guard cowers on the floor as the thief makes his way around display cabinets and threatens other security staff. He points his weapon at two workers unpacking the jewels before taking a bag and display tray full of jewels. The man then calmly walks back across the room and through the same set of patio doors with his haul. He made off on foot through the exclusive Promenade de la Croisette which stretches a mile and a half along the Cannes seafront. Daring: The thief threatens a second security guard and starts to make his way around the central display as staff begin to panic in the background . Terrifying: A member of staff is forced to the ground as the robber stands over him demanding the jewels . Loot: The man, still pointing his gun at a member of staff, reaches down and grabs a bag and display tray full of jewels . Police say that they were not aware that the jewels were due to go on display at the hotel and that exhibitors normally inform them of such a high value display. In a bitter irony, the Carlton is the setting for Alfred Hitchcock’s 1955 film To Catch A Thief, a romantic thriller starring Grace Kelly and Cary Grant about a jewel thief operating in the Riviera. At the time experts linked the raid to the infamous Pink Panther group after several members of the group escaped from jail in the period before it took place. According to Interpol, the Pink Panthers gained notoriety by targeting luxury watch and jewellery stores in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the United States, netting more than £380million. Escape: The man calmly walks out towards a packed promenade carrying the jewels. Police have still not found him . Raid: A police car is seen outside the Carlton hotel after thieves fled with £35million worth of jewellery . Organised gangs frequently target boutiques and hotels in and around Cannes. In May, jewellery worth £1million was stolen from a hotel safe during the annual Cannes Film Festival. An unnamed American woman working for Chopard, the Swiss jeweller and festival sponsor, was keeping the items in her second-floor room at the Cannes Novotel. Chopard had 40 staff at Cannes who tried to persuade stars to wear its products. Heist: The jewellery was at a temporary exhibition at the Carlton which was being organised by Leviev . French Rivera: The Carlton hotel which was targeted by raiders is on the seafront in Cannes . Julianne Moore, Cindy Crawford and Cara Delevingne were all seen wearing Chopard pieces this year. Celebrity wearers: Cara Delevingne is pictured wearing Chopard jewellery at the Cannes Film Festival in May . A few days later a necklace worth £1.6million vanished after a festival party in the neighbouring resort town of Cap d’Antibes. Just days after the audacious raid at the Carlton, robbers armed with guns and grenades carried out another raid on a luxury watch boutique yeards from the hotel. The following month watches worth thousands of pounds were taken when staff at the Hyatt Regency Palais de la Mediterranee hotel in Nice after a gang of armed men threatened staff. And in September, a raider was allegedly shot dead by the owner of an upmarket gold and watch store in Nice after armed men ordered him to open the safe. He gave chase as they made their getaway and reportedly shot one of the men dead in the street outside. The 343-room InterContinental Carlton is a favourite of the stars, and is considered the ‘celebrity HQ’ during the film festival. In August 1994, three men firing machine guns burst into the Carlton and robbed its jewellery store. Later, it was discovered the gang were firing blanks. There have been several high-profile jewellery thefts in Europe this year, including one at Brussels airport in February which saw £32million worth of diamonds taken. The biggest-ever diamond heist was at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam in 2005. Dressed in stolen uniforms belonging to the Dutch airline KLM and driving a stolen KLM van, thieves hijacked an armoured truck containing uncut diamonds worth an estimated £50million. They have never been recovered. Glittering: Penelope Cruz, left, and Dita Von Tease, right, have also been seen wearing Chopard pieces this year .","A thief pointed a handgun at staff at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes in July .

Outstanding debt: Diego Maradona has been hit with a staggering 39million euro (£33million) tax bill . Diego Maradona has been hit with a staggering £33million tax bill for alleged unpaid taxes during his successful career with Napoli in the late 1980s. The 'hand of God' footballer, who many consider one of the greatest players of all time, has been notified by Italy's tax collection agency that it will freeze his assets to pay off the outstanding debt. However, it is claimed the move is simply a formal procedure - with the papers only . having a 180-day validity and therefore having to be renewed whenever . Maradona is in Italy. 'This is not putting pressure,' said a source at the Equitalia tax recovery . agency. The 52-year-old star, who has been in Milan promoting a DVD series on his life and watching his Napoli play Roma, was handed the tax bill - amounting to 39million euros - in his hotel room. He is believed to have signed the notification, which legally enables authorities to seize the star's assets in Italy. Maradona's tax woes stem from his time playing for Napoli between 1984 and 1991, when he helped the club win its only two Serie A titles in 1987 and 1990. In 2005, the striker was ordered to pay 37.2million euros - 23.5million euros of which were interest on the debt. However, Italian prosecutors started the trial from scratch in 2011 in what was seen as a victory by Maradona's lawyer in Italy, Angelo Pisani. A final ruling on January 10 this year from a court in Naples has now made the sentence definitive. 'I am not a tax fraudster,' the star protested last year. 'I was playing football and someone else was signing for me.' Icon: The striker celebrates scoring a goal for Napoli during an Italian League match against Milan . During previous visits to Italy, tax agents have confiscated £3,700 diamond earrings and two Rolex watches worth £9,000 from Maradona. The footballing legend, who is the only player to have set world-record contract fees twice, scored 115 goals in 259 games with Napoli. He also helped Argentina win the World Cup in 1986. The former cocaine addict is now a sports ambassador for the United Arab Emirates following his departure from local club Al Wasl in 2012.","The 'hand of God' footballer hit with a staggering £33million tax bill .

The Health Secretary will warn a million elderly are left forgotten and isolated because friends and relatives fail to visit them. Citing the example of Asian nations, he will say families should take more responsibility for grandparents and not leave caring to the state. Mr Hunt, who has a Chinese wife, will say he is struck by the reverence and respect for the elderly in the Far East. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) will warn today that a million elderly are left forgotten and isolated because friends and relatives fail to visit them. (Woman, right, posed by model) ‘In those countries, when living alone is no longer possible, residential care is a last rather than a first option,’ he will say in a hard-hitting speech. ‘And the social contract is stronger because, as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old. ‘If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this. ‘It will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents. Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. A forgotten million who live among us – ignored to our national shame.’ Mr Hunt will make clear that some families have no option but to put older relatives in residential or nursing care and should not be ‘condemned for taking that difficult decision’. Mr Hunt will give his speech at the National Children and Adults Services conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, saying ‘entering old age should not involve waving goodbye to one’s dignity’. He will add: ‘According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely. Mr Hunt will make clear that some families have no option but to put older relatives in residential or nursing care and should not be 'condemned for taking that difficult decision'. Posed by models . ‘Some five million people say television is their main form of company – that’s 10 per cent of the population. ‘We know there is a broader problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society.’ The Health Secretary will also hit out at cases of abuse in care homes and pledge to beef up inspection of both public and private sector homes. ‘112,000 cases of alleged abuse were referred by English councils in 2012/13, the majority involving over-65s,’ he will say. ‘Something is badly wrong in a society where potentially one thousand such instances are happening every single week. ‘Which is why I am delighted that this year, for the first time, we have appointed a chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe. Like all our new chief inspectors, she will act as a champion of the people who use the services – the nation’s whistleblower-in-chief.’ At the same conference, health minister Norman Lamb yesterday announced plans for tougher inspection checks to clamp down on rushed 15-minute care visits, which risk stripping people of their dignity. He said that, from April, the Care Quality Commission watchdog is likely to be tasked with looking at whether home care visits are long enough to respond to people’s needs. And inspectors will also consider looking at how working conditions might be impacting on care. ‘The current approach to home care is not fair on those who need support, it’s not fair on care workers and it is stripping away the human element,’ he said. ‘Fifteen minutes is not enough time to help people who are older or who have a disability to do everyday things like wash, dress and get out of bed. Some do not even get the chance to have a conversation with their home care worker, who may be the only person they see that day. Andrea Sutcliffe, the new chief inspector of social care, will act as a champion of the people who use the service . ‘These tougher checks would ask specific questions about the amount of time allocated for visits and whether staff are suitably supported to do this. 'This is particularly important because these are services delivered in private, behind closed doors. I want to build a fairer society, and that means providing better care in care homes, and in people’s own homes.’ Last night, Caroline Abrahams, a director of the charity Age UK, called for a ‘seismic shift’ in attitudes toward older people and ageing. She added: ‘As we get older, we are more likely to suffer illness and disability which can prevent us from getting out and about, and people’s social networks often shrink due to life-changing events such as retirement and bereavement which can increase the risk of becoming lonely. 'At Age UK we are extremely concerned that cuts to local authority budgets are exacerbating the problem of loneliness because they are causing the closure of many support services for older people, like lunch clubs, which can be a lifeline for those on their own. ‘These cuts are also pushing to breaking point many families who are trying to care for their older relatives in the absence of adequate support. 'Caring is often a 24/7 role that can have a huge physical and emotional impact on the carer.’ Inspiration: Jeremy Hunt with his wife Lucia Guo . The wife who taught Jeremy Hunt China's way of caring for the old . Jeremy Hunt became interested in the Asian way of caring for the elderly after marrying a Chinese woman. The Health Secretary met Lucia Guo five years ago at a conference in London where she was working as a recruiter for Chinese students. Her parents often travel to Britain and he is learning their language, Mandarin. ‘It’s quite halting, but my parents-in-law don’t speak English and so I get a chance to practise with them,’ he said last summer. Three in ten Chinese families have grandparents living in the same household and Confucius, who taught about the importance of the family and the need to respect your elders, is still a big influence in the country. In traditional society, it is considered shameful for children to refuse to look after their parents. The vast majority of elderly people would live with one of their children, with very few living alone. Old people’s homes were once virtually unknown. Confucian beliefs encourage the younger generation to respect their elders for their wisdom, and most important decisions are traditionally made by consulting them. There is less of a culture of youth in China, with younger people expected to defer  to older people, let them speak first, sit down after them and not contradict them. However, in recent years, things have been changing in some of the growing cities – with fewer believing they have to look after their elders. As the middle class expands, many of them find they have little time to care for their parents. A poll has found that around a quarter of Chinese senior citizens now live alone – something that would once have been unforgivable. Mr Hunt, 46, who is the Charterhouse-educated son of an admiral, spent much of his twenties in Japan and may have learned about their reverence for the elderly during his time there. Described as ‘ferociously bright’, his wife comes from the city of Xi’an in north-east China, near the site of the famous Terracotta Army. The couple divide their time between London and his constituency of South West Surrey. They have two children: John, three, and Anna, one.","Jeremy Hunt will today warn a million .

Spanish women have the highest life expectancy in Europe - well ahead of their British counterparts, according to new research. They make it to 85 on average, managing 2.4 more years than women in the UK. Britain came equal 19th with Portugal in a survey of women’s life expectancies in the continent's 53 countries. Spanish women have the highest life expectancy in Europe - 85 years . French women, who also enjoy a healthy diet rich in fruit and vegetables, were only just behind the Spanish, clocking up an average 84.8 years. Meanwhile, British men would be better off moving to Israel, which tops the male life expectancy league - Israeli men make an average of 80.1 years, compared with Britain’s 78.4. This puts Britain at 11th on the list, just behind Spain where male life expectancy is 78.8 years. Men in the Russian Federation came bottom of the table with a life expectancy of just 62.8 years. Kyrgyzstan had the lowest life expectancy for women – just 73 years. The figures highlight the unequal improvements in health across Europe and will encourage calls for a ‘measurement of wellbeing’ as a marker of progress. The European Health Report 2012 says that although average life expectancy is rising across the region, increasing by five years since 1980 to reach 76 in 2010, major inequities are found between men and women and between countries. The leading health risk factors for Europeans today include tobacco and harmful alcohol use . Overall, life expectancy for women reached an average of 80 in 2010, while that for men was 72.5 years. Lifestyle and occupational differences largely explain this gap. Conditions such as heart disease, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease account for 80 per cent of deaths in Europe. And diseases of the circulatory system such as heart disease and stroke are the most important cause of premature death before the age of 65, accounting for nearly 50 per cent of the total. Cancer is the second leading cause, accounting for nearly 20 per cent, while injuries and poisoning are responsible for nine per cent. The leading health risk factors for Europeans today include tobacco and harmful alcohol use, with alcohol accounting for an estimated 6.5 per cent of all deaths. In 2010 adults in the UK drank an average 10.1 litres of alcohol, putting us equal 23rd with the Poles in consumption, and behind the average of 10.6. In 2009, just over one in five Britons smoked - behind 27 other countries - with the European average being 27 per cent. Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe, said: ‘The European Region is undergoing important changes that are shaping health priorities, and the needs for disease prevention and care in the future. ‘The trends identified in this report help us to anticipate some of the challenges that Europe is facing and will face in the future. ‘But there are persistent and widespread inequities in health across the Region, which in some cases are worsening. These are unnecessary and unjust and must be a priority for us to address collectively.’","Spanish women live the longest - an average of 85 years, compared to British women's 82.6 years .

William Hague said it would be harder now for a comprehensive pupil to become Foreign Secretary now . It is harder today for a state-educated teenager to reach the top than a generation ago, William Hague has admitted. The Foreign Secretary, who attended a Yorkshire comprehensive, warned there has been a ‘disturbing’ decline in social mobility over the past three decades. But as the row over the Cabinet being dominated by a privately-educated elite rumbles on, Mr Hague insisted he had ‘never felt socially inferior to anybody’. Mr Hague spoke out after former Prime Minister Sir John Major condemned the ‘shocking’ way the upper echelons of society were filled by the privately-educated and affluent individuals in powerful positions. Prime Minister David Cameron also suggested yesterday that social mobility is being held back because people from outside the white middle-class can lack the ‘aspiration’ to make it into top jobs. Mr Hague, who attended the state Wath-upon-Dearne School, put the blame on shortcomings in the education system, which he said were being tackled by Education Secretary Michael Gove. Mr Hague told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘I did go to a comprehensive school and I've become the Foreign Secretary so not everything goes to privately-educated people. ‘The disturbing thing, I would say, is that in the 30-odd years since I was at a comprehensive school, it probably in those intervening decades will have become a bit harder for somebody from a comprehensive school to become the Foreign Secretary, or whatever position they aspire to. ‘That reflects on a long period of this country falling too far behind in the world in state education, and thankfully we now have the best Education Secretary in living memory - or longer - who is trying to put that right.’ Mr Hague insisted he had never felt 'socially inferior' to Eton-educated Prime Minister David Cameron . Mr Hague played down the suggestion that his state-school background left him feeling ‘socially inferior’ to Eton-educated Mr Cameron. ‘I can tell you, having grown up in South Yorkshire, in Rotherham, and been to a comprehensive school, I've never felt socially inferior to anybody. And I have met most of the kings, presidents, queens and princes of the world,’ he said. Sir John Major said the dominance of the well-heeled was 'shocking' Ministers have been at pains to stress the work being done in education and welfare to raise achievements and aspirations of children from poorer backgrounds. It follows Sir John’s repeated interventions in which he has spoken out about the dangers of out-of-touch well-heeled politicians indifferent to the needs of the poor. His latest remarks were seen as a thinly-veiled reference to the wealthy backgrounds of Mr Cameron's government, in contrast to Sir John's own upbringing in a rented flat in Brixton, South London. During a speech to the South Norfolk Conservative Association on Friday evening, Sir John said: ‘In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class. ‘To me, from my background, I find that truly shocking.’ Downing Street rejected the criticism, insisting policies to help people get on were more important than the background of politicians. But Education Secretary Mr Gove, who was adopted at just four months, insisted Sir John was 'right'. He told BBC Radio 4: 'It’s an inescapable fact. And that’s one of the reasons why both I was speaking today about social work and the vital need to make sure that vulnerable children don’t suffer from neglect and don’t have their futures blighted.’","Foreign Secretary warns of 'disturbing' decline in social mobility .

Archaeologists discovered the 600-year-old casket yesterday morning beneath a second lead coffin, believed to hold medieval knight Sir William Moton. Site director Matthew Morris, who discovered the former king last August, said the latest development is rare and exciting. Mr Morris said: 'For me, this is more exciting than Richard III. The lead-lined coffin was discovered when the first excavation was carried out last year but it was left undisturbed while work concentrated on the king's burial spot . 'I think that's because there wasn't that expectation to find Richard - we never thought we would actually uncover him. 'Here, we have an element of mystery, we don't really know who's inside. 'I just haven't come across a stone tomb with an interior lead coffin before. 'You can tell it's a high-status grave because of the expense of the lead and the effort of making the stone tomb. 'We can't really be sure about what's happened to the grave over the past 600 years, but the lid of the coffin doesn't match the rest of it and there's some damage to the mortar so it looks like it might have been opened.' Richard III's remains were discovered underneath a car park in Leicester last year . Eight people were needed to lift the stone lid of the 14th century coffin, which will now go to the University of Leicester for analysis. The remains are encased in 5mm-thick lead. But the exposed feet, and some damage to the lead, suggest the corpse was dug up and reburied hundreds of years ago. A crucifix embellished on the lid suggests religious valuables may have been placed in the coffin but removed some time later, according to lead diggers. The team discovered the tomb containing the lead coffin last August but recovered it to concentrate on excavating Richard III. The casket is the first fully . intact stone coffin found in Leicester, and is likely to contain a . high-status burial – although experts do not know who is buried within. Grey Friars site director Mathew . Morris, of the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS), . said: 'Stone coffins are unusual in Leicester – and this is the first . time we have found a fully intact stone coffin during all our . excavations of medieval sites in the city.' Experts suspect the grave could belong to one of three prestigious figures known to buried at the friary. These include two leaders of the English . Grey Friars order - Peter Swynsfeld, who died in 1272, and William of . Nottingham, who died in 1330. Records also suggest the friary contains the grave of ‘a knight called Mutton, sometime mayor of Leicester’. This may be 14th century knight Sir William de Moton of Peckleton, who died between 1356 and 1362. The ULAS team also hope the dig will help to uncover more details . about Richard III’s burial and its place within the Grey Friars church, . as well as a much clearer picture of the church’s layout, dimensions and . architecture.

Experts are investigating the remains of a group of friars who were beheaded by Henry IV in the . early 15th century too. The story suggests they met their end . after they subscribed to the rumour that the deposed King Richard II was . still alive and were providing money for rebels who aimed to topple his . successor, Henry IV. Archaeologists have made a large trench measuring 25m by 17m around the area where Richard’s skeleton was found. They has uncovered the north-east end of the church, including the choir area and the walking . place around the main tower of the building. The trench runs between Leicester . City Council’s Grey Friars car park and the neighbouring car park of the . former Alderman Newton School. Richard III was discovered squashed into a very small and badly prepared 'lozenge'-shaped pit as gravediggers rushed to bury him . Richard III was identified by analysing his his curved spine - he was reputed to have a hunched back - and the injuries he was reported to have sustained. During the latest dig, archaeologists will make a large trench measuring 25m by 17m around the area where his skeleton was found . It was one woman's hunch led to the discovery of the skeleton which has now been proven to be that of Richard III.Screenwriter Philippa Langley said she felt a chill on a hot summer's day in 2009 as she walked through the area where it was thought he was buried. Miss Langley initially funded the excavation of what is now a Leicester City Council car park because she was '99 per cent certain' that the remains were those of Richard. The team have secured permission to remove part of the Victorian wall separating the two areas. The site of Richard III’s burial place has been temporarily secured to protect it from the digging work during the excavation. Richard Buckley, lead archaeologist, said: 'We hope this dig will expand the context of Richard III’s grave. We also want to preserve the grave’s relationship with the rest of the site. We want to leave some evidence of later activities on the site - including how close it was to the Victorian outhouse. 'What drives us with the project is learning more about medieval Leicester and one of its great religious houses. 'We hope this dig is going to give us a definitive plan of the dimensions and architecture of the church. 'We may be able to recover more fragments. We might learn more about the dissolution of the church, and we might learn more about what was there before the friary.'","Remains of Richard III were discovered under a car park among the ruins of a church in Leicester last September .

When Avery was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called spinal muscular atrophy, the couple decided to channel their anger and grief and make memories out of every moment of their daughter’s life.

One of goals on the list was a little more salacious: Get a tattoo. Bucket list: Little Avery Canahuati was diagnosed with Type 1 spinal . muscular atrophy and died aged 6 months . The cheery blog has struck a chord with parents across the world. Mrs Canahuati told Good Morning America that’s when the couple knew they had a powerful platform on which to speak. The mother said: ‘When we saw how many people it was reaching in a few days, that’s when we realised we could really get the word out on SMA and spread the word as much as we could.’ The disease is the number one killer of U.S. children under two, she said, though the disease is largely unknown.

An exclusive British Airways lounge reserved for the airline's first class passengers has been found to have questionable standards when it comes to food hygiene and safety. Despite the promise of the ‘Concorde Room and First Lounge‘ at London Heathrow Terminal 5 offering ‘an exclusive a la carte menu with an emphasis on the freshness and quality of ingredients', when it comes to cleanliness, passengers may have been better off eating from a burger van or kebab shop. In the latest food safety inspection, the lounge which is reserved for the airline's most valuable customers, received a score of 2 out of 5 being awarded, placing the venue in the bottom 10% of all food establishments in England. It looks nice: But would you want to eat here? The Food Standards Agency awarded the Concorde Room (pictured) at London Heathrow Terminal 5 a two out of five for food safety . Flying low: BA's exclusive Concorde Room scored a miserable 2 out of 5 when it came to food safety. It places the establishment in the bottom 10% of all food places in England with pubs and even greasy burger vans performing better . The findings were published online by the Food Standards Agency although there is now a Freedom of Information request to reveal the full details of the inspection. British Airways describes the lounges as providing an ‘exceptional experience’ and ‘outstanding food’. It advertises the Concorde Room as being the ‘epitome of elegance’, inspired by ‘the finest five-star boutique hotels’. A . British Airways spokeswoman told MailOnline ‘We work with BaxterStorey . to provide a high quality service to customers using our lounges, and . take all feedback seriously. ‘We continue to invest in our product and are currently renovating our kitchen facilities.’ However, . the airline was unable to provide any clear explanation for the poor . levels of hygiene revealed in its most recent food safety inspection . conducted less than two months ago, at the peak of the summer holidays. Not good enough: The findings by the Food Standard Agency on the British Airways Concorde & First Class Lounge are clear for all to see . BaxterStorey have released a statement concerning the poor results they received. 'We are very disappointed with the results of the audit by Hillingdon Council of the British Airways First Class and Concorde kitchen. We would like to acknowledge that a score of 2 is not acceptable to us and we apologise to our customers and British Airways for the management failures that contributed to this score. We had already taken immediate remedial action based on the points highlighted verbally during the inspection of July 29th. All specific management failings were rectified immediately and we continue to monitor our performance rigorously. BaxterStorey and British Airways have been working on a plan to renovate the lounge kitchens to ensure we can deliver a product to meet the high standards required by both companies and to cope with increasing demand.' The statement goes onto mention an extensive renovation of the First and Concorde lounge kitchens including upgraded storage facilities and new equipment is now underway and will be completed by the end of October. Staff are also being retrained in food hygiene skills. Unhappy fliers: There has been disquiet amongst loyal ranks of BA fliers since a new catering company, BaxterStorey, took over at the start of 2013 . Although there have been no reports of . any passengers becoming ill from the low levels of hygiene found in the . Executive Club lounges, the food safety ratings are designed to help the . public make an informed decision. The . food hygiene rating or inspection result given to a particular business . reflects the standards of food hygiene found on the date of inspection . with venues being graded on a six-point scale from zero to five. Crash landing: Gordon Ramsey's 'Plane Food' which also operates in Terminal 5 at Heathrow scored '2' as well in the most recent inspection . A poor performance can be as a . result of any number of factors including bad refrigeration, food cross . contamination, poor hand-washing, poor food rotation and poor . temperature control. Many school canteens and hospital kitchens receive a '5' grading, as do supermarket and office staff canteens. The lounges weren't the only venue scoring below par in the most recent Terminal 5 inspection. Gordon Ramsay's 'Plane Food' restaurant also scored a 2 during a survey earlier this year, along with a branch of Café Nero in the terminal. The . airline can take some comfort from the fact its other lounges at . Heathrow scored top marks with the British Airways' Terminal 3 . lounge receiving 5 out of 5 along with another Galleries lounge based in Terminal 5, albeit both were assessed prior to . BaxterStorey taking over the catering operation. Lounges . operated by Aer Lingus, Cathay Pacific, American Airlines, Virgin . Atlantic and many others also scored well during the latest round of . inspections. The firm which provides food for the . lounge, BaxterStorey, has been ordered to make improvements by the Food . Standards Agency. It was rated as ‘poor’ in the category of food hygiene . and safety. Poor is classed as ‘some major non-compliance with statutory obligations – more effort required to prevent fall in standards’. The . firm, co-founded and chaired by Scot Alastair Storey, won a five-year . contract to run catering the lounge, which includes the Concorde Room, . in January. Negative feedback: Comments posted in guest books in the airline lounges are clear that all is not well amongst the ranks of BA's highest-paying passengers and most loyal customers . In a separate issue, the latest . findings may come as no surprise to frequent BA travellers who claim . they have seen the quality of offerings provided by the exclusive lounge . decline dramatically in recent months an apparent bid to cut costs. A . number of blogs have even been created that chart the demise in the . quality of food being offered to the airlines’ most loyal members. Before and after photos on baloungefood.com show how once-appetising buffet food has been replaced by something more akin to school dinners. One . blogger compared how things had changed writing:  ‘It was a typical . buffet, not amazing quality food but was adequate when you just needed . something quick to eat. Now things are particularly poor. Just random . trays of things in liquids, often all the meat gets fished out and you . end up with trays full of sauce.’ Another . frequent flier told MailOnline, ‘Frankly, this is appalling. The . Concorde Lounge and First Galleries used to be something fliers aspired . to access - the crème de la crème of aviation lounges. Hearing about . such poor levels of hygiene makes me want to pack my own sandwich before . a flight. At least I know it will be clean!’ Gold standard? The lounge is reserved for those frequent fliers who have access and those traveling on the most expensive business and first class BA tickets . To fly, to serve: Loyal BA customers are left wondering whether they'd want the airline serving them any kind of food after the latest food safety inspection results . One passenger commented: ‘the items on offer were all sauce based dishes which resembled gloop.’ Even the airlines’ most dedicated frequent fliers were outraged in the decline in the quality of food being provided in what is considered to be the airlines’ flagship lounge. Many have left their thoughts known in the airline's lounge guest books, usually filled with praise and compliments. ‘Filthy! Not a decent place to sit, You should be ashamed!’ wrote one passenger. ‘I would have been better off waiting in the monkey enclosure at London Zoo’ agreed another. ‘Please change your catering company ASAP!’ Food for thought: On blogs, online forums and even guest books placed with the airline's own lounge, very few positive comments can be found .","Food Standards Agency gave flagship lounge a rating of 2 out of 5 for 'Food Safety'

You’ve settled into your fancy hotel room – pillows fluffed, complimentary chocolates eaten, room service on order. There’s just one problem. The room is absolutely freezing. You attempt to crank up the heat as far as the hotel will allow it to go- but it still isn’t warm enough. Scroll down for video... The trick allows you to get into the VIP mode on an INNCOM thermostat which overrides its temperature range and turns off the motion sensor . If you’re like most people, you’ll grab a jumper and a hot drink and make do. But one cunning traveller has found a way to get around the problem using a technique that overrides the hotel’s thermostat. The Points, Miles and Martinis blog describes a code that works for all INNCOM thermostats. INNCOM systems, created by heating controls group  Honeywell, are installed in more than 1,000,000 hotel rooms worldwide including Hilton hotels. To override the thermostat hold down the ‘display’ button and at the same time press the ‘off’ key. Release off while continuing to hold down display, and press the ‘up’ arrow button. Then release all the buttons. If the screen shows ‘VIP’ you have successfully overridden the thermostat. The VIP mode turns off the motion sensor and allows a lower and higher range of the thermostat. Now you can kick back, enjoy room service and be as toasty or as cool as you want.

A police officer who faces getting fired for failing to return to work after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School last year has revealed his battle with post traumatic stress disorder. Thomas Bean said he is unable to forget the horrifying scenes he witnessed as one of the first responding police officers on December 14, when a gunman shot dead 26, including 20 children. Speaking to the Today show, he revealed he had an urge to self harm after the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut and that he often cried in his sleep - or struggled to sleep at all. 'I can't describe the overwhelming . senses of emotions that I had,' he said. 'That night I drank a lot. The next day, I wanted to cut myself because I just felt so numb.' Scroll down for video . Struggle: Thomas Bean, who was one of the first cops to respond to Sandy Hook Elementary School following the shooting there last year, is fighting for long-term disability benefits as he now suffers from PTSD . As well as unexplained outbursts of anger, he also suffered flashbacks - sometimes seeing the scenes of horror out of the corner of his eye as he carried on a conversation. He spoke with a friend who was a PTSD specialist and sought treatment, and a doctor recommended that he should not return to work. Bean is the only officer not to return to the department following the massacre, although at least 14 others missed work because of PTSD associated with the killings. He said he is now hopeful that the town keeps its promise to protect its officers. 'They promised us – all of us, all the police officers – that if we do our job, and something happens, they’re going to take care of us,' he told the Today show. 'And they're not holding up their word and that's all we want them to do, for myself and for anybody else that this is going to happen to.' Grisly memories: Speaking to Savannah Guthrie next to a representative from his union, Mr Bean said he would cry in the night and had an urge to self harm after witnessing the horrific scenes . In August, Newtown Police Chief Michael Kehoe sent Bean a letter telling him that termination with the department was 'warranted and will be my recommendation to the Newtown Police Commission'. Kehoe asked Mr Bean to meet with him 'to discuss the issue of whether termination of your employment is necessary due to the medical disability and your options if that is true. 'They haven't given him many options. It's either quit and get nothing, retire and get nothing or we will fire you and you get nothing,' Newtown police union President Scott Ruszczyk told The Courant. Union officials said they expect Bean to be dismissed because the town does not want to pick up the cost of paying half of his salary until he is eligible to retire - which is mandated by the union. Bean has been receiving long-term disability benefits, but the town's insurance police will only cover two years of long-term disability. Terror: A police officer runs with teachers and a child during the terrifying incident in December 2012 . Site: The school is being demolished and the site should be entirely destroyed on the 1-year anniversary . 'The town tried to pinch some pennies by buying the wrong type of insurance policy, ' said Eric Brown, attorney for the Newtown Police Union, reported NBC. 'Tom acknowledges, based on his own reports, that he's probably not going to be able to come back to work. The question is what type of benefit is he entitled to?' Mr Brown said. Bean said he thinks other police . officers would like to file disability claims but have returned to work . because they fear the repercussions. 'I . believe some of them are afraid of what’s going on, so now they can’t . take care of themselves, because they’re too worried about the . financial, which is a huge burden,' he said. Last month the demolition of Sandy Hook Elementary School began under a cloak of secrecy and security to discourage ghoulish souvenir-hunters. Officials hope it will be completely dismantled by the one-year anniversary of the attack.","Thomas Bean was one of the first officers to respond to Sandy Hook Elementary School after 26 were shot - including 20 children - last year .

Built on the request of businessmen who often find themselves in dangerous situations - no, really - a bespoke tailoring house in Toronto today unveiled a hand-tailored three-piece 'bulletproof' suit. Garrison Bespoke invited members of the media to the Rod and Gun Club in Ontario to fire off a few rounds at a bust form dressed in the navy pinstripe vest, matching two-button jacket and trousers that they claim can stop a speeding bullet. The outfit has been made with several sheets of carbon nano-tubes - a state-of-the-art puncture-proof and bullet-resistant material sourced through a company that provides anti-ballistic gear for the U.S. Army Special Forces. The patented material is thinner, more flexible and 50 per cent stronger than Kevlar, the traditional material used for bulletproof gear. In an added bonus, the suit also protects against stabbing, with the carbon nano-tubes created to harden on impact, preventing a knife from penetrating through. Stealthy chic: A marksman opens fire at a bulletproof suit created by Canadian label Garrison Bespoke at a gun range in Ontario today. The suit, lined with ultra thin sheets of carbon nano-tube technology, starts at $20,000 . Inspection: Media at a demonstration of the suit's capabilities were invited to both shoot at the three-piece outfit and see whether the bullets penetrated . Proof: A slug is revealed from caught between the lining . Everyday wear: The suit was created to look exactly like any other well-tailored despite its special features . While Garrison Bespoke announced that all the suits in their new line, called Town & Country, can be made bulletproof by request, it doesn't come cheap. Prices start at $20,000. But what price would you put on your life and looking good? 'After receiving requests from high-profile clients who travel to dangerous places for work, we set out to develop a lightweight, fashion-forward bulletproof suit as a more discreet and stylish alternative to wearing a bulky vest underneath,' Michael Nguyen, co-owner and bespoke tailor of Garrison Bespoke told The Globe And Mail. Perhaps the bigger question is, though, how badly do you want to tell your friends that you own a bulletproof suit? Mr Ngyuen likened some of the clients who . have ordered a Garrison Bespoke in bulletproof to guys that buy sports cars . which never leave the garage. 'They may never wear the suit, but they still want to own one,' he said. Comparatively, a made-to-order suit from . designer labels like Gucci and Valentino cost about $3,500, while an . off-the-rack black suit from Dolce & Gabbana is about $2,200. Fire: A bulletproof suit made by Garrison Bespoke tailors is displayed at a gun range in Ajax, Ontorio, during a demonstration on Tuesday, November 5, 2013 . Slugs are revealed after being pulled out of the super-strong protective layer fitted into the suit . The nano-tube fibers - which were woven into the suits lining as sheets - were so strong they had to be cut with a band saw while making the suits. They are also said to cause less bruising than other available bulletproof gear. Carbon nano-tubes are 50 per cent lighter than Kevlar and 30 times stronger than steel, which is why they are increasingly being used to make more streamlined protective gear for military and security professionals, not to mention politicians. U.S. President Barack Obama was rumored to have worn an overcoat and suit incorporating carbon nano-tubes during his first inauguration. Mr Ngyuen said it was around that time one of Garrison's clients, a cosmetics-company executive, was assassinated in the Philippines. 'Many of our customers work in finance, mining and oil, and are often traveling to dangerous parts of certain countries,' Mr. Nguyen said. Michael Nguyen, co-owner of Garrison Bespoke tailors, points out bullet holes on a bulletproof suit made by the company after it was shot at from a handgun . 'They could dress in casual clothes to not stand out, but they wear suits to make a good impression and be taken seriously. 'It only makes sense that they should have access to one that will make them look professional, but also feel safe.' Maxwell Morgan, CEO of Aramor Payments, an electronic-payments provider serving e-commerce companies worldwide, was one person considering buying one of the new suits following the demonstration. 'I’m married with three children, so I’m always concerned about getting home [from work trips] safely,' he said. The nano-tube fibers used as the bulletproof technology were so strong during the making of the suit they had to be cut with a ban saw. Here a tailor shows how pieces were cut using fabric stencils so they could be easily slipped into the lining of a regular suit . Mr Morgan does not travel with security and will travel to Africa and Colombia on business in the coming months. 'I don’t like the idea of wearing a heavy bulletproof vest, but a jacket that fits like a glove and is made with military-grade material that’s stronger than Kevlar – why not?' he said. Miguel Caballero, a Colombian company which coined itself the 'Armani of bulletproof attire', have been developing similiar pieces since the 1990s.","Made-to-order bulletproof suits launched at a gun range today by Canadian tailor shop Garrison Bespoke, complete with open-ammo demonstration .

A 28-year-old television producer who died of cancer this week is posthumously suing a hospital after her diagnosis and treatment were delayed following an alleged error. Houda Rafle from Toronto, Canada, passed away on Wednesday - just as she had begun legal action against Trillium Health Partners after a radiologist failed to spot a tumor near her heart. The young television producer had originally gone to Toronto's Trillium Health Centre on March 5 complaining of shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting. Houda Rafle, 28, died of cancer on Wednesday morning in the intensive care unit of Toronto General Hospital. She had claimed in a lawsuit that a doctor failed to notice a tumour, delaying her diagnosis for five months . She underwent a CT scan which revealed a half-inch mass just above her heart, but radiologist Dr Ivo 'Ivan' Slezic did not notice it, her lawsuit claims. Five months later she returned to the hospital with a persistent cough and, following further CT scans, the tumor was finally spotted. By this time it had grown to nearly an inch in size and spread to her lungs, the Toronto Star reported. Doctors diagnosed stage IV angiosarcoma, which eventually spread to her brain. She subsequently learned that Dr Slezic's role had been restricted months earlier and an external review begun on 3,500 CT scans and mammograms he read between April 2012 and March this year. Miss Rafle's lawsuit claims that Trillium was negligent in not alerting her to the review, and that Dr Slezic should not have been working because 'his abilities were impaired by fatigue, medical conditions or other factors.' Her lawyer, Duncan Embury, told the Star: 'She lost her life a as result of failure of the medical system. It’s about accountability in our system. When it comes to disease processes like this, time matters.' Miss Rafle died in the intensive care unit of Toronto General Hospital in the early hours of Wednesday, her six brothers and sisters by her bedside. They believe should would still be alive today if her condition was diagnosed earlier. Her sister Deeqa, 23, told the Star: 'It’s absolutely unfair . . . misdiagnosis, 28, healthy before that, my role model, my best friend, my big sister. It’s a lot.'

"By . James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 11:59 EST, 29 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:20 EST, 30 November 2013 . An 999 call handler who was sending an ambulance to a nursery where a baby girl was choking ended the call by saying: 'Jeez, stop giving me information', an inquest heard. North West Ambulance Service emergency medical dispatcher Aaliyah Ormerod made the comment after she put down the phone, unaware she was still being recorded. The 999 call was played to a jury at the inquest into the death of nine-month-old Millie Thompson, who died at Ramillies Hall private nursery in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, in October last year. An emergency medical dispatcher has admitted she made two 'fundamental' errors while responding to a call as Millie Thompson was choking . A member of staff at the nursery called for an ambulance and told Ms Ormerod that Millie had begun choking and crying and had turned 'a bit purple' after she ate shepherd's pie for lunch. The call came to an end after Ms Ormerod took details of Millie's condition, gave the caller instructions and told her an ambulance was on its way. Ms Ormerod said as she ended the call: 'Bye bye... Jeez, stop giving me information.' An inquest at Oldham Magistrates’ Court was told nursery staff and paramedics were unable to save Millie, from Bramhall, Cheshire. Paramedic Paul Williams said: 'I don't think there was anything else I could have done.' In a statement read to the court, Ms Ormerod admitted she did not appreciate the seriousness of the situation and did not stay on the line to monitor Millie’s condition. She said she began to ask a series of scripted questions when she received the call. She was given the address of the scene and was then informed that a baby was choking, crying, still breathing but was going 'a bit purple'. Joanne and Dan Thompson with their daughter Millie, who died last year after choking at a nursery . Ms Ormerod continued to ask further scripted questions and learned the child was not breathing normally after she had choked. She . told a nursery assistant not to slap Millie on the back any longer . because that could cause a further lodging of any food stuck down the . throat. Then continuing to follow the prompted questions, she advised the youngster should not eat or drink anything. She should also be rested in the most comfortable position on her side in case she vomited. Ms Ormerod ended the call by asking the school to ring back immediately if anything changed. Following a review of the call, she admitted she had made the 'fundamental errors'. She stated: 'When told the patient was going purple, I did not click this indicated breathing problems.' Staff at Ramillies Hall private nursery in Cheadle Hulme, Manchester, rang for assistance after Millie got into breathing difficulties after she was fed shepherd's pie . This should have generated a more immediate response and not a continuation of the scripts she followed, she said. She went on: 'I should have stayed on the line to monitor the patient’s breathing and not exit the call.' Explaining that she had suffered a stillbirth herself, she said the thought that her actions could have contributed to a death 'has devastated me'. The inquest heard how the 999 call hander made mistakes in how she graded the call last October . She added she considered it an 'isolated error' and said she thought the automatic prompting system should be improved. Ms Ormerod, who was not present at the hearing, is still employed by the same ambulance service but now works in a different control room. Addressing the jury on the opening day of the inquest yesterday, Millie’s mother Joanne said all she wanted to know was how her 'perfectly healthy' daughter did not come home from the nursery. Millie started coughing and crying during her mashed feed in a high chair before her lips turned blue. Nursery staff performed first aid on the youngster as they waited for emergency assistance on October 23. An ambulance arrived 10 minutes later but Millie had gone into cardiac arrest and less than a hour later she was pronounced dead at Stepping Hill Hospital. A recording of the 999 phone call was played to the jury. At the end of the call, when the operator says goodbye, she is still being recorded as she says: 'Jeez, stop giving me information.' South Manchester coroner John Pollard said he expected her employers to take action over that comment. Earlier a nursery assistant told her: 'She’s crying, she’s breath..she’s crying and she seems to be breathing. But she seems to be choking a little bit. She’s still... she just crying at the minute and it seems to have been happening for three minutes now, she seems to be going a little bit discoloured, a little bit purply.' Angela Lee, section manager in the emergency control room, said the call operator should have graded a 'red response' of an immediate threat to life. The inquest heard how that requires a vehicle response within eight minutes. Millie, pictured with her father Dan, started coughing and crying during her mashed feed in a high chair before her lips turned blue . Asked why Ms Ormerod had not chosen that option, Ms Lee said: 'The call operator did not follow her training and did not identify Millie had ineffective breathing at the start of the call. 'The word ""purple"" or ""blue"" or ""gasping for breath"" acts as a trigger for an immediate red response before any more questions are asked.' She explained that made no practical difference in this case as to how quickly the ambulance arrived but a rapid response car might have got there one or two minutes sooner. Ms Lee said the operator did not have an explanation as to why she did not stay on the line but said she felt she had been 'bombarded with details'. Joanne and Dan Thompson were pictured outside Oldham Magistrates' Court yesterday at the inquest into their daughter's death . Mr Pollard said: 'What I cannot understand is there can only be in my mind no more important a call than a baby choking?' The witness said: 'I totally agree with you. She should have stayed on the line. It’s unacceptable.' The coroner suggested: 'This was a complete aberration.' Ms Lee replied: 'Yes.' Angela Lee, section manager in the emergency control room, said the call operator should have graded a 'red response' of an immediate threat to life . The inquest heard that so far no disciplinary proceedings have been taken against the call operator. All the service’s emergency medical despatchers - who are not medically trained - have since received retraining on calls regarding choking. Ms Ormerod returned to work about six months ago in the same role, although a doctor ruled her medically unfit to give evidence this week at the inquest or in the foreseeable future. Earlier, paramedic Paul Williams told the hearing he 'immediately knew' it was not a normal choking incident when he arrived at the nursery. 'It appeared more serious,' he said. He described Millie as looking 'floppy and pale' with 'quite blue-ish lips'. Her heart was not beating in the ambulance and he failed with various attempts to resuscitate her before a decision was made to rush her to hospital. Millie had no signs of life on arrival at Stepping Hill Hospital and was pronounced dead soon afterwards. Emergency medical technician Susan Richardson arrived at the nursery in a second, back-up ambulance. She recalled a conversation with a woman wearing a dark suit who was beside the vehicle as other medics battled to save Millie's life. 'I asked her what happened,' she said. 'She said that Millie had had a bit of a coughing do and had gone downhill.' Asked if that woman had been forthcoming with answers to her questions, the witness said: 'She was very non-committal. 'The police had arrived by this time. She seemed to be looking down the driveway to see what was going on. 'I asked the lady if she (Millie) had any medical history, any underlying problems. She said ""No, I don't know"". She was quite off.' The hearing continues next Tuesday.

The owner said the situation couldn't be a 'worse nightmare' and vowed to get to the bottom of the accusations and counter-accusations of harassment around his locker room. 'I think anybody would be appalled. When you first read that text that was reported, to me I didn't realize people would talk or text or speak that way to people,' he said at a joint press conference last night. Scroll down for video .

Missing the point: Fans brought homemade posters (some vulgar, as seen at left) to the Monday night game . His words of support for Martin appeared to be in stark contrast to the views of fans at Monday night's game. Many showed up . with handmade signs of support not for the alleged victim but his accused tormentor, Richie Incognito. Incognito . has been suspended indefinitely following accusations he verbally abused Martin on a . daily basis. Ross will meet with Martin on Wednesday at an undisclosed location.. 'I look forward to meeting with Jonathan Martin, discovering the facts,' Ross said. 'It couldn't have been a worse . nightmare,' he said flanked by team . president and chief executive officer Tom Garfinkel. He added he wanted to create a locker room culture that 'suits the 21st . century.' The real estate developer who first bought a majority stake in the Dolphins in 2008 said he also planned to meet with Incognito saying he also 'deserved to be heard'. The NFL is also investigating Martin's allegations against teammates, including Richie Incognito. Standing by him: Richie Incognito has been suspended indefinitely from the Miami Dolphins after he was accused of harassing a former teammate on a daily basis . More than frenemies: Richie Incognito (center left), seen on the bench with Jonathan Martin (center right) who claims he was the subject of daily harassment . Martin, . 24, is with his family in California and is due to undergo counseling for . emotional issues. The . 6-foot-4, 320-pound player left the team two weeks ago. His . attorney has alleged that Martin was harassed daily, and Incognito . acknowledged leaving a voicemail for Martin in April in which he used a . racist term, threatened to kill his teammate and threatened to slap . Martin's mother. Fan favorite: Some supporters at Monday night's game made signs to show Richie Incognito that they still have his back even after the allegations of how he abused a teammate . Incognito is white and Martin is biracial. Teammates both black and white have said Incognito is not a racist, and they've been more supportive of the veteran guard than they have of Martin. Incognito, 6-3, 319 pounds, has long . been labeled one of the NFL's dirtiest players with a reputation for . out-of-bounds behavior off the field. But . this season he was a member of the player leadership council, raising . questions about the role of coach Joe Philbin, his staff and Miami . management in the case. A special investigator for the league . will determine whether Incognito harassed Martin, and whether the . Dolphins mishandled the matter. Ross strongly endorsed Philbin, saying he had the 'utmost confidence' in the man he hired in 2012. 'Joe Philbin is probably one of the most organized people I've ever met,' Ross said. 'When . I interviewed him that stood out, but what also stood out was his . character. I don't think there is a better person, a more respected . person, a more caring person in the National Football League than Joe . Philbin.' While not holding Philbin responsible, Ross said changes need to be made in his organization. 'We need to look at ourselves. We have to examine everything internally,' Ross said. 'This . is so appalling to me. I know I'm capable of overreacting. I want to . get everybody's feedback because we all know the football locker room is . a different workplace than most of us are accustomed to. I don't want . to make any excuses.' Ross . said to he has formed a committee of advisers with five members who are . tasked with protecting ‘me and them and the players from my . overreacting, and having a code of conduct that suits the 21st century’. Road trip: Richie Incognito has long been labeled one of the NFL's dirtiest players with a reputation for out-of-bounds behavior off the field . ‘Change is needed. We're going to make sure we're the best organization in the National Football League,' he said. Also in question is the team's role in a May 2012 incident involving Incognito. A police report said a female . volunteer at a Dolphins charity golf tournament complained that . Incognito harassed her, but he wasn't charged, and news of the case . surfaced only last week. Incognito, 30, has declined to say whether coaches ordered him to toughen up Martin, a second-year pro from Stanford. Martin says he was harassed daily, and Incognito acknowledged leaving a voicemail for Martin in April in which he used a racist term, threatened to kill his teammate and threatened to slap Martin's mother . The scandal is the latest public-relations headache for Ross since he became majority owner of the Dolphins in 2009. They've endured four consecutive losing seasons, their longest such streak since the 1960s, and often play in a half-empty stadium, their local popularity eclipsed by the Miami Heat.

The son of notorious mob boss John Gotti walked into a Long Island hospital bleeding claiming that he had broken up a fight in a convenience store parking lot. John Gotti Jr., 49, took over the Gambino crime family but now says that he is no longer involved with organized crime, but he refused to tell police about the fight that he reportedly broke up on Sunday night that led to him being stabbed. The New York Post reports that he was calm and polite when he walked into Syosset Hospital asking for a doctor. Shady circumstances: John Gotti Jr (pictured here in 2011) was stabbed over the weekend and when he sought medical treatment, he said it was from trying to break up a fight . He initially said that he was injured while trying to stop a fight between two strangers in a CVS parking lot. 'He's being very uncooperative. He says these guys were fighting and he jumps in and is this big savior and he gets stabbed in the stomach,' and unidentified official told ABC News. No details have been released about his condition or the specific injuries he sustained, but the Daily News reports that they were serious enough for him to be transferred to North Shore University Hospital. He stopped revealing any details as soon as police arrived, putting an end to one information stream. 'He didn’t say anything to us so there was really no lead to track down at that point,' an unidentified police source told The Post. Out of the racket: Gotti Jr was the subject of four federal trials between 2005 and 2009 but all ended in mistrials and he said he now no longer participates in the Gambino crime family (pictured in 2006) Troubles: Gotti, seen here in an undated photo, claims he left the criminal world in 1999 . Gotti has not only clammed up when it comes to law enforcement, but also to his own lawyer as attorney Charles Carnesi told the paper that he had not heard from his infamous client about the incident. With the limited leads that they have to pursue, police are now left looking for surveillance footage and speaking to CVS employees to see if there will be any charges. Gotti has been tried four times since 2005 for racketeering. Each trial ended in a hung jury, leading many to say that he was following in his father's footsteps since John Gotti senior earned the nickname 'Teflon Don' after being acquitted in numerous trials. 'Junior' said he left organized crime in 1999. Dapper Don: John Gotti Sr was known for his penchant for designer clothes and his ability to get out of convictions which was later attributed to jury tampering (pictured in 1990) All in the family: John Jr and his sister Victoria turned to television after Victoria launched a reality show . Of all the Gotti children, John Jr. is the only one to follow his father into a life of crime. By 1982, John Jr. already had become a Gambino Family 'associate,' and by 1990 he had been named a 'capo' in the organization. In regards to her son's career with the mob, Victoria Gotti told the New York Daily News in 2006 that she felt 'betrayed' that her husband had dragged their son into a life of crime. 'I pretty much raised my children alone with Johnny being away for years at a time, so it broke my heart. I felt betrayed, the worst betrayal. I would rather have dealt with other women,' she told the paper. The Gottis' daughter Victoria starred in the A&E reality TV series Growing Up Gotti, which chronicled the lives of the former mafia don's grandchildren Carmine, John and Frank. The series was canceled in 2005 after 41 episodes.","John Gotti Jr walked into a Long Island hospital with a stab wound .

Looking unhappily dishevelled in the rain as he dutifully watched a border collie demonstrating its skill rounding up chickens, Prince Charles’s thoughts are bound to have strayed — if only for a moment — to the sanctuary of the white cottage where he and Camilla have been staying all this week on their annual summer trip to Wales. Imagine his pleasure as the royal rump sank thankfully that evening into the deep cushioning of the stripy sofas. Family ties: Annabel Elliot, left and sister Camilla are close confidants . From there he could admire the Welsh weavings on the walls while dinner was being set under the vaulted ceiling of the dining hall with its medieval-style wrought-iron chandeliers and stone fireplace that even features his own heraldic badge above it — the Prince of Wales’s feathers. The 100-year-old cottage is Charles’s royal bolt-hole nestling close to the Black Mountains in the Carmarthenshire village of Myddfai, and is called Llwynywermod House. One who knew the 192-acre estate with its three cottages before the Duchy of Cornwall bought it in 2006, remembers its ‘tasteless’ salmon pink walls and brown velour sofas. So different now, with its colour scheme of duck-egg blue — Camilla’s choice, it has been murmured. Well, not quite. Like the Duchy of Cornwall’s 21 holiday-let cottages in the Scilly Isles, Cornwall and Wales, this one (which cannot be rented, incidentally) is the work of the only interior designer on whom the Duchy ever calls, Camilla’s younger sister Annabel Elliot. Until the former Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles married the Prince of Wales at Windsor in 2005, the Duchy’s commissions to her little sister were... zero. Together at last: Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall finally married in 2005 . Soon after Camilla became HRH the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchy decided to go into the holiday cottage-letting business, the first commissions were on their way to Annabel. One long-time family friend spikily described the work put her way as ‘just a few crumbs from her big sister’s table’. But this week, amid renewed assorted cries of cronyism and nepotism, it emerged that the crumbs have grown into a loaf. Indeed, in the past eight years, Annabel Elliot has received almost £1.2 million from the 700-year-old Duchy for ‘interior design services’. In the past two years alone, ‘fees and commission’ have amounted to some £210,000 — not bad with the country going through lean times. Her earnings from this source remain a substantial part of the recent income of Annabel Elliot Ltd, which for some years has been run from a small industrial unit near Salisbury, Wiltshire, rented from the council for £350 a month. Discreet: Annabel Elliot allowed Charles and Camilla to have trysts at her Dorset home . Because it is classed as a small business it is not required to submit full profit-loss accounts. But publicly available figures show that, just before the Duchy work began, her company’s liabilities exceeded assets by £54,000. Figures for the last financial year show assets of £227,000. Let us be clear about one thing: Annabel Elliot is known to be good at her work. She says she always tries to mirror the taste of her clients. That duck-egg blue in Charles’s Welsh cottage is the basis of the theme because it happens to be Camilla’s favourite colour. But while Britain has many talented interior designers, Annabel is the only one mentioned in the accounts of the Duchy, which funds Charles’s multi-million pound lifestyle and last year paid him some £19 million. So why do no other interior designers get a look in? The Duchy’s answer comes directly from the Prince’s spokesperson at Clarence House, and is crystal clear: ‘The Prince is very happy with Mrs Elliot’s work — she’s very experienced and does a good job. And as we have said many times before, the Duchy does not have to put the work out to tender because it is a private estate.’ Which is the sound of a door slamming shut on the hopes of others. Could the reason be that he is indebted, in a way that he could never adequately repay, to his sister-in-law Annabel for her help during his most difficult years while he was still married to Diana. The two sisters have always been incredibly close, as was obvious as they sat together the other day in the royal box at Wimbledon. Theirs is the easy intimacy of sisters who know each other’s secrets. Certainly, there is practically nothing that Annabel — 18 months younger, and always seen as the prettier and brainier of the two — does not know about the tumultuous years of her sister’s infamous affair with Charles. She was hostess, chauffeur, confidante — ‘the third person in the romance,’ was the wry observation of a close family friend. Allies: Annabel and Camilla together at this year's Wimbledon . Among their wider circle, however, it is generally accepted that, more than anyone else, Annabel found herself ‘sucked into the drama of her sister’s affair’ and, in many ways, found herself sharing the burden with her. One family friend feels she ‘sometimes rather resented it as she had her own life to lead, but did it anyway as that’s what sisters are for’. Both sisters married within a year of each other — Annabel at 23 in 1972 to businessman Simon Elliot (her only ‘real’ boyfriend), son of an RAF Air Chief Marshal, Camilla at 25 (after a brief affair with Prince Charles) to dashing Guards officer Andrew Parker Bowles. In those later, endless years when Camilla and Charles were secret lovers, it was Annabel and Simon’s country home, where they still live, in the Dorset village of Stourpaine that became the Prince and Mrs Parker Bowles’s favourite meeting place for discreet weekends. Commissions: Annabel is the only interior designer that the Duchy of Cornwall uses and has been rewarded handsomely for her role . Thus Annabel was drawn into Camilla’s drama. She became the sister that Camilla simply couldn’t do without. It was at Annabel’s own 40th birthday party, held in the Ham Common home of her friend Lady Annabel Goldsmith, that Princess Diana angrily confronted Camilla about her relationship with Charles. Again, Annabel was at the wheel of the car in December 1992 that whisked Camilla away and out of public view as Prime Minister John Major was announcing in the House of Commons the separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Most significantly of all, Charles used the occasion of Annabel’s 50th birthday party at the Ritz Hotel in 1999 — just over a year after Diana’s death — to publicly formalise the relationship with Camilla that everyone knew about, by posing for pictures on the steps of the hotel. After this, Camilla’s enduring gratitude is only natural. ‘She will do anything she can for Annabel,’ says one of their circle. ‘And Charles will do anything to keep Camilla happy.’ One way of keeping her happy was to ask Annabel and Simon to join them on their honeymoon at Balmoral. On their wedding night the staff set the honeymoon table for four. In fact, the Prince’s gratitude to Annabel is as considerable as Camilla’s. For all his many self-regarding faults, he never forgets people who do him a good turn. Royal bolt-hole: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, hosting a tea party at in Llwynywermod House, with her favourite duck-egg blue colour in the background . For her part, Annabel, 64, while publicly discreet, can be rather grand in private. ‘She’s terribly prone to mention “my sister the Duchess” or “my royal sister”,’ reports one significant member of their circle. ‘It’s quite amusing.’ Not so amusing is the unease among royal courtiers. For the Duchy’s exclusive patronage of Camilla’s sister is yet another awkward and potential damaging issue on top of those already building up over Charles’s stewardship of the Duchy. He has approved feasibility studies to build large housing estates on some of the country’s most cherished pastures despite intoning on television his familiar mantra about protecting the countryside. And renewed efforts are being made by MPs to change the way he pays tax on his Duchy income.Ironically, all this has come about when the royals are going through their most popular and relaxed period for many years. ‘He could easily have ended the cronyism issue by asking other designers to submit ideas for the revamped cottages,’ says one close figure. ‘But he won’t. Yes, he’s grateful to Annabel, but he’s stubborn as well.’","Charles and Camilla had trysts at her sister Annabel's country home .

Former Labour Foreign Secretary David Owen (pictured) has demanded that Sir Jeremy Heywood by stripped of responsibility for deciding whether key documents can be published by the Iraq Inquiry . David Owen has demanded that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood be stripped of responsibility for deciding whether key documents can be published by the Iraq Inquiry. The inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot complained last week that his probe has stalled indefinitely because Sir Jeremy is blocking the release of correspondence between Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and US President George W. Bush. But Lord Owen, who was a Labour Foreign Secretary in the late 70s, said Sir Jeremy is not the right ‘arbiter’ of whether the papers are released since he also worked closely with Mr Blair in the run up to war. In a letter to David Cameron yesterday, Lord Owen wrote: ‘Sir Jeremy Heywood was Principal Private Secretary to Tony Blair in No 10 from 1999-2003, the very time when the decisions to go to war were being taken. ‘I cannot believe that now as Cabinet Secretary he can be the arbiter as to whether documents should be published between Sir John Chilcot and Tony Blair. ‘It is obvious that there are differences of opinion as Sir John writes in his letter to you that it is “regrettable that the Government and the Inquiry have not reached” an agreement.’ In a direct challenge to the Prime Minister, Lord Owen urged Mr Cameron to assert his authority and hand the responsibility to Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling, who already has responsibility for deciding which government papers can be released under the 30-year rule. ‘Who is the Government?’ he asks, ‘You as Prime Minister? The Cabinet? Surely not for the reasons I have given, the Cabinet Secretary? ‘I suggest you ask the Lord Chancellor to form a judgement on behalf of the Government as to what papers can be released.’ He added: ‘The Iraq Inquiry involves a decision to declare war and from the moment it was established it was clear it would involve examination of international discussions between British Prime Ministers and US Presidents. If there is a precedent it is the inquiry held during the First World War to examine the Dardanelles.’ In a letter to Mr Cameron last week, Sir John revealed that he has asked for ‘more than 130 records of conversations’ between Mr Brown, Tony Blair and Mr Bush to be declassified. The hold up has also involves whether to make public ‘25 Notes from Mr Blair to President Bush’ and ‘some 200 Cabinet-level discussions’. In his letter, Sir John said: ‘It is regrettable that the Government and the Inquiry have not reached a final position on the disclosure of these more difficult categories of document. Lord Owen pointed to the fact Sir Jeremy was Principal Private Secretary to Tony Blair between 1999-2003 . A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘The Inquiry and Government agreed in the Inquiry’s Documents Protocol that the Cabinet Secretary should be the final arbiter of declassification - that remains unchanged and has the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister’s full support. ‘At the outset the Government assured the Inquiry of its full cooperation and it continues to do so.’ Allies of Sir Jeremy pointed out that Mr Cameron has asked the Cabinet Secretary to take a lead on the declassification of the documents ‘and that remains his view’. The Prime Minister has repeatedly relied on Sir Jeremy - for instance on the No 10 probe of the plebgate allegations against former chief whip Andrew Mitchell - where MPs think he should have given to the responsibility to others.","Inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot said last week that his probe has stalled indefinitely because Sir Jeremy is blocking the release of correspondence .

Auction: The 1969 triptych, never before offered at auction, carried a pre-sale estimate of about $85 million . The art work along with one by Andy Warhol were expected to break records, boosting an already surging market for top-tier works. Christie's sale on Tuesday was led by Bacon' 1969 triptych. The jaw-dropping price easily broke the $86.3 million Bacon record set in 2008, months before financial markets crashed and sent the art market into a brief decline. Since then, new, deep-pocketed collectors from around the globe have driven prices to record levels. At a recent preview, Christie's head of postwar and contemporary art, Brett Gorvy, noted that collectors from Asia, Russia and the Mideast flush with cash were determined to assemble world-class collections featuring trophy works.

Famed artist: Bacon is one of America's most famed painters. Two of his other works of art are shown left and right . In May, Christie's achieved the highest total in the history of auctions when it sold $495 million worth of art at its postwar and contemporary sale. The auction house said Bacon's three-paneled work, which depicts the Dublin-born painter's friend and fellow artist Lucian Freud on a chair, with a view from each side and one face on, was 'a true masterpiece that marks Bacon and Freud's relationship' and their 'creative and emotional kinship.' 'The juxtaposition of radiant sunshine yellow contrasting with the brutal physicality and immediacy of the brushstrokes in this celebrated life-size triptych is what makes Bacon's art so remarkable,' said Francis Outred, the head of European postwar and contemporary art for Christie's. 'This suddenly becomes a very important conversation between two masters,' Outred said in an interview. He noted that 'Three Studies of Lucian Freud' is one of only two existing full-length triptychs of Freud, a grandson of the founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud, and that the three panels were separated for 15 years in the 1970s before being reunited. Christie's also offering a Warhol 'Coca-Cola,' which carries an estimate of $40 million to $60 million, and a sculpture by Jeff Koons, 'Balloon Dog (Orange)' expected to fetch $35 million to $55 million. On Wednesday, Sotheby's will try to break the $71.7 million record price for a Warhol when if offers the monumental 'Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster),' which has an estimated sale price of $60 million to $80 million.","Francis Bacon's three-paneled painting 'Three Studies of Lucian Freud' became the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction on Tuesday .

The 11th-century minaret of a famed mosque that towered over Aleppo's old quarter was destroyed yesterday as fighting raged in the ancient Syrian city. President Bashar Assad's government and the rebels trying to overthrow him accused each other of being to blame for the destruction to the Umayyad Mosque, a UNESCO world heritage site and centerpiece of Aleppo's walled Old City. 'This is like blowing up the Taj Mahal or destroying the Acropolis in Athens. This mosque is a living sanctuary,' said Helga Seeden, a professor of archaeology at the American University of Beirut. 'This is a disaster. In terms of heritage, this is the worst I've seen in Syria. I'm horrified.' Wrecked: The rubble-strewn remains of the 12th century Umayyad Mosque in Aleppo which has been devastated by heavy shelling . Jewel: The complex pictured in 2009 before Syria's cataclysmic war turned it into a denuded shell . Aleppo, Syria's largest city and a commercial hub, emerged as a key battleground in the nation's civil war after rebels launched an offensive there last summer. Since then, the fighting has carved the city into rebel- and regime-held zones, killed thousands of people, forced thousands more to flee their homes and laid waste to entire neighborhoods. The Umayyad Mosque complex, which dates mostly from the 12th century, suffered extensive damage in October as both sides fought to control the walled compound in the heart of the old city. The fighting left the mosque burned, scarred by bullets and trashed. Two weeks earlier, the nearby medieval covered market, or souk, was gutted by a fire sparked by fighting. With thousands of years of written history, Syria is home to archaeological treasures that date back to biblical times, including the desert oasis of Palmyra, a cultural center of the ancient world. The nation's capital, Damascus, is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world. At least five of Syria's six World Heritage sites have been damaged in the fighting, according to UNESCO, the U.N.'s cultural agency. Looters have broken into one of the . world's best-preserved Crusader castles, Crac des Chevaliers, and ruins . in the ancient city of Palmyra were damaged. Both . rebel and regime forces have set up bases in some of Syria's . significant historic sites, including citadels and Turkish bath houses, . while thieves have stolen artifacts from museums. The destruction of the minaret - which . dated to 1090 and was the oldest surviving part of the Umayyad Mosque - . brought outrage and grief. 'What . is happening is a big shame,' said Imad a-Khal, a 59-year-old Christian . businessman in Aleppo. 'Thousands of tourists used to visit this site. Every day is a black day for Syrians.' Both rebel and regime forces have set up bases in some of Syria's significant historic sites, including citadels and Turkish bath houses, while thieves have stolen artifacts from museums . After: Image taken from a video show how the precincts of the mosque have been subjected to a barrage of artillery. Though many of the original features remain, they have been badly damaged . Ruined: Syrian rebel fighters stand in a damaged section of the Umayyad Mosque complex . The main Western-backed opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, accused the government of intentionally committing 'a crime against civilisation and humanity' by destroying the minaret. 'The regime has done all it can to tear apart the Syrian social fabric,' the Coalition said in a statement. 'By its killings and destruction of heritage, it is planting bitterness in the hearts of the people that will be difficult to erase for a long time to come. There were conflicting accounts about what leveled the minaret, leaving the once-soaring stone tower a pile of rubble and twisted metal scattered in the mosque's tiled courtyard. Syria's state news agency said rebels from the al Qaida-linked Jabhat al-Nusra group blew it up, while Aleppo-based activist Mohammed al-Khatib said a Syrian army tank fired a shell that 'totally destroyed' the minaret. The mosque fell into rebel hands earlier this year after heavy fighting but the area around the compound remains contested, with Syrian troops just some 200 yards away. An amateur video posted online by the anti-government Aleppo Media Center showed the mosque's vaulted archways charred from earlier fighting and a pile of rubble where the minaret used to be. Standing inside the mosque courtyard, a man who appeared to be a rebel fighter, said regime forces recently fired seven shells at the minaret but failed to knock it down. On Wednesday, the tank rounds struck their target, he said. 'We were standing here today and suddenly shells started hitting the minaret,' the man said. The army 'then tried to storm the mosque but we pushed them back. The video appeared genuine and corresponded to other reporting. A picture from last week shows Syrian rebel fighters walking in the Umayyad Mosque complex . The destruction in Aleppo follows the collapse a week earlier of the minaret of the historic Omari Mosque in the southern city of Daraa. The Daraa mosque was built during the Islamic conquest of Syria in the days of Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab in the seventh century. In that instance as well, the opposition and regime blamed each other. The state news agency accused Jabhat al-Nusra of positioning cameras around the area to record the event. Whether the destruction is targeted or not, the damage highlights the difficulties of protecting a nation's cultural heritage in wartime. 'Culture can only really be protected in peace time. When you have open warfare, it is impossible,' said Seeden, the archaeology professor in Beirut. 'When buildings are under fire, you cannot protect the buildings. You can't protect what's in it, if they are mosaics, wall paintings, architectural details that are part of the building - there's no way you can protect them.' After the Umayyad Mosque was first damaged last year, Assad issued a presidential decree to form a committee to repair it by the end of 2013, although it's not clear what such a body could do amid a raging civil war. The mosque's last renovations began about 20 years ago and were completed in 2006. The damage in Aleppo is just part of the wider devastation caused by the country's conflict, which began more than two years ago with largely peaceful protests but morphed into a civil war as the opposition took up arms in the face of a withering government crackdown. The fighting has exacted a huge toll, killing more than 70,000 people, leaving cities, towns and villages in ruins and forcing more than a million people to flee their homes and seek refuge abroad. Also yesterday, Syrian church officials said the whereabouts of two bishops kidnapped in northern Syria remain unknown, a day after telling reporters the priests had been released. Gunmen pulled Bishop Boulos Yazigi of the Greek Orthodox Church and Bishop John Ibrahim of the Assyrian Orthodox Church from their car and killed their driver on Monday while they were traveling outside Aleppo. It was not clear who abducted the priests. But Bishop Tony Yazigi of the Damascus-based Greek Orthodox Church said the gunmen are believed to be Chechen fighters from Jabhat al-Nusra. Yazigi declined to say what made it appear that the Nusra Front was involved. That account corresponded with one provided by the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said foreign fighters had abducted the bishops near a checkpoint outside Aleppo. Director Rami Abdul-Rahman said activists in the area said the gunmen were foreign fighters from the Caucuses. However, the main opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, condemned the kidnapping and blamed Assad's regime. In Rome, Pope Francis called for the rapid release of the two bishops. In his appeal Tuesday, the pontiff called the abduction 'a dramatic confirmation of the tragic situation in which the Syrian population and its Christian community are living.' There has been a spike in kidnappings in northern Syria, much of which is controlled by the rebels, and around Damascus in recent months. Residents blame criminal groups that have ties to both the regime and the rebels for the abductions of wealthy residents traveling to Syria from neighboring Turkey and Lebanon.","It was minaret of famed mosque that towered over Aleppo's old quarter .

The 45-year-old is happy to get cosy in front of a film or while listening to music depending on what her customers want. Scroll down for video . The day job: Kitty Mansfield earns up to £360 a day cuddling up to men as the UK's first professional snuggler . They can even stay the weekend as part of her B&B weekend deal, and get into bed with two women for a 'stereo snuggle' with Kitty and her second snuggler, Natalya. 'It's a theraputic service for people who want to be snuggled,' Kitty said. 'People can just come and talk, or they can snuggle wherever they want for as long as they want. 'People want to feel a connection. It's something we have lost out on, touching has become a taboo.' So much love to give: Kitty Mansfield opens her arms to people who crave intimacy and want to cuddle up on the sofa, or even in her bed . Dressed in her pyjamas and slippers, Kitty charges £45 an hour for her 'Be Snuggled' business just by wrapping her arms around her clients at her seaside home. She even invites her clients to bring along their favourite pillow, blanket or teddy bear. Kitty said: 'From the moment we're born we want to be held, it's just natural. 'I think certain people are better at snuggling than others, but as I like to be close to people, I think I do have a skill.' Don't cross the line: Kitty draws a line at full intimacy and cuddlers have to wear underwear at all times . The service, which is the first of it's kind in the UK and just one of two in the world, is completely non-sexual. Kitty's rules clearly state that 'any innapropriate requests or behaviour will result in your immediate exit' and areas normally covered by underwear are off-limits. She insists that underwear must be worn at all times, and shorts and tank tops are prohibited - clients should wear pyjamas or a t-shirt and tracksuit bottoms. Kitty launched the business after working as a holistic therapist for ten years, using the power of touch to soothe and heal. Entrepreneur: Kitty launched her business, Be Snuggled, after 10 years working as a holistic therapist . But while her holistic massage has helped her clients deal with their aches and pains, she always felt that a part of the jigsaw was still missing. After heavily researching the benefits of 'snuggling', she opened Be Snuggled. She said: 'People love to be cuddled because it feels good and offers simple contact. 'However, not everyone has a suitable cuddling partner, somewhere out there someone is in serious need of human contact, yet he or she has no-one to turn to. 'At Be Snuggled, you will discover a safe, warm and non-judgemental oasis where you can step out of your everyday life, rediscover the pleasure of non-sexual snuggling and enjoy the many psychological and physiological benefits of cuddling.' Kitty has also written a 'Cuddle Sutra' for her clients, which is filled with detailed descriptions and illustrations, before deciding exactly how they'd like to be snuggled. Cuddle Sutra: Kitty even has a list of different types of cuddles that her clients can choose from. Here she poses with 'snugglee' Mike Parker . Kitty's research has taught her there is a lot more to being snuggled than merely getting close to someone. 'One proven health benefit of cuddling is the release of oxytocin,' she said. 'Known as the feel-good hormone, oxytocin creates a sense of well-being and happiness. 'In addition, physical contact with others can lower blood pressure and reduce stress.' But Kitty, who is separated, is aware that many will fail to understand the basics behind her Be Snuggled service. She said: 'People think it's weird for people to just want to be cuddled if it's not sexual. 'People have become so standoffish and political correctness has taken over. 'I think I will get some criticism because it's not a standard type of service I'm offering. 'But the way I see it, hostility is just a symptom of fear.'","Kitty Mansfield from Kent charges £45 an hour for a hug .

Lifelong battle: Jacqueline Kemp, 64, has suffered from anorexia for more than half a century . A woman has told of her pain of battling anorexia for more than half a century - and how it has robbed her of her health, happiness and chance of having a family. Jacqueline Kemp, 64, started losing weight in 1962 after feeling 'ugly' compared to her best friend at school. Within months, she was in the grip of the eating disorder - with her weight soon plummeting to a tiny five stone. However, with little help available for teenagers suffering from anorexia, Ms Kemp, from Dunfermline, Fife, never fully recovered. At 5ft 5in tall, she has never weighed more than seven stone. Now, more than 50 years after she first starved herself, Ms Kemp has spoken out about her lifetime of anorexia in a bid to help others. 'I have never been able to hold down a proper job as I was taking a cocktail of drugs to help with my anorexia and I spent most of my time as an out-patient at the hospital,' she said. 'I missed the chance to have my own family - I married anorexia and everything else came second. 'As much as I wanted to have children, I knew I couldn’t as the thought of putting on weight terrified me. I still haven’t overcome anorexia I have just learned to live with it.' With 'no real understanding' of the illness in the '60s, Ms Kemp said she was left to starve herself. 'I was never called pretty': Ms Kemp at the age of six, left, and as a teenager, right. She first started to starve herself after feeling 'ugly' compared to her best friend at school . 'My friend was always being called pretty - and I never was,' she said. 'As a young teenager, that made me feel worthless in comparison. 'I was so confused, there was no real treatment for anorexia back in the 1960s - I was just left to starve and deal with the illness myself. 'My teenage years were awful - I was desperately thin and only weighed around five stone. 'I can never remember exactly how much I weighed during this time as I was too ill to really function properly. 'I was just left to starve': Miss Kemp, pictured in her late teens, was soon in the grip of the eating disorder . Illness: Her weight plummeted to five stone - and, even now, she has never weighed more than seven stone . 'Anorexia has made me feel insecure and I have found it hard to make friends - as you can imagine a lot of socialising revolves around food - something I was never able to be part of. 'Even the thought of being given a biscuit with a cup of tea would of completely terrified me.' She added: 'I was too fixated by the way I looked and, more importantly, how much I weighed.' Ms Kemp's life has been a cycle of compulsive eating, laxatives and starvation - the consequences of which she is still living with. She has been left with poor digestion, as well as problems with her sinuses and teeth. Opening up: Ms Kemp, from Dunfermline, Fife, has spoken out about her lifetime of anorexia in a bid to help others. Above, she is pictured in her mid-20s . Dangerous: Her life has been a cycle of compulsive eating, laxatives and starvation. Here, Ms Kemp, second right, is pictured with her sister Sylvia and her parents . 'There are so many women and men dying from anorexia - it’s a growing problem especially now there’s pro-anorexia websites,' she said. 'They should all be shut down. I have no idea why and how people could try and influence others to lose weight when they are already so thin. 'But the support for anorexia nowadays is great - there are plenty of support groups and charities willing to help.' Despite admitting that she is probably still too thin, Ms Kemp feels her eating disorder is now manageable and she has learned to overcome her fears of eating. Consequences: Ms Kemp, pictured in her 50s, left, and late 30s, right, has been left with poor digestion, as well as problems with her sinuses and teeth . She also says she is determined to help other sufferers. 'I just want people to speak out if they’re struggling with an eating disorder - there is a lot of help out there now,' she said. 'There is no reason for anyone to allow an eating disorder to take over your life - I want my story to be a warning to anyone contemplating losing weight unnecessarily.' Leanne Thorndyke, a spokesman for Beat, an eating disorder charity, said: 'Eating disorders are treatable conditions and full recovery is possible. 'I want people to speak out': Ms Kemp wants her story as to act as a 'warning' to other anorexia sufferers . Still battling: The 64-year-old admits she is probably still too thin, but says her anorexia is now 'manageable' 'The sooner someone gets the treatment they need, the more likely they are to make a full recovery. 'Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses and more than 1.6 million men and women of all ages and backgrounds in the UK are affected. 'We challenge stereotypes and stigma, increase understanding and campaign for better services and access to treatment.' To illustrate her lifelong battle with anorexia, Ms Kemp has written a book called ‘Size Zero & Beyond’.","Jacqueline Kemp, 64, has battled anorexia for more than 50 years .

The document says none of the six individuals targeted by the NSA is accused of being involved in terror plots and all are believed to currently reside outside the U.S. Among . the vulnerabilities listed by the NSA that can be exploited . are 'viewing sexually explicit material online' and 'using sexually . explicit persuasive language when communicating with inexperienced young . girls'. The . NSA document, dated October 3, 2012, repeatedly refers to the power of . charges of hypocrisy to undermine such a messenger, the The Huffington Post reported.

Dorothy Lee Barnett disappeared with her 11-month-old baby from South Carolina in 1994, only to be located and arrested in Australia this month after almost 20 years on the run. As her extradition back to the U.S. to face kidnapping charges appears inevitable, information has emerged about the situation the troubled mother was in before she hatched a plan to flee the country. According to Benjamin Harris Todd - Barnett's ex-husband and the father of Savanna Harris Todd, who has been living in Queensland, Australia, under the name Samantha Geldenhuys - he took Barnett to court before the birth of their baby because of her worrying behavior. In a little-seen interview with Columbia Journalism School from 2009, Todd - a successful investment banker who lives in the exclusive ocean-side S.C. suburb of Isle of Palms - said he divorced Barnett citing 'physical cruelty'. He said there marriage was impromptu, with a planned vacation to the Bahamas quickly refashioned as a honeymoon, and that soon after his wife his wife turned violent. Todd alleged Barnett would attack him while driving in their car. He said she wouldn't sleep for 'seven or eight days at a stretch' and would 'beat her head against a wall for what seemed like hours. One night, he awoke to find her lying in a fetal position on the floor, staring at nothing, rocking back and forth. First time she has been seen in 20 years: Savanna Harris Todd (right) pictured for the first time since disappearing as a baby in 1994. Now living under the name Samantha Geldenhuys in Queensland, Australia, she is seen here in a Facebook photo . A long way from South Carolina: Savanna Harris Todd and her mother Dorothy Lee Burnett have been living on the Sunshine Coast, in the Australian state of Queensland, for at least the last four years under fake names. They had been officially listed as missing persons since 1994 until Barnett was arrest on November 4 . Then and now: Savanna Harris Todd has remained a missing person for 19 years after being kidnapped by her mother in April 1994. Pictures of her as a baby (left) were used to create impressions of what she might look like today (right). On November 4, Savanna was located in Queensland, Australia, living under the name Samantha with her mother, Dorothy Lee Barnett, who has been charged with three federal offenses . 'I've never hit a woman in my life,' Todd said. 'I can't explain why I let myself be hit.' In February 1993, after two years together, Todd left Barnett, who was pregnant with their daughter. He went into hiding and would sometimes sleep in his car. I was on the run from her, hiding out at friends' houses. She'd drive around all night, looking for me, and sometimes she'd find me. She'd stand outside the house and scream that she was going to kill herself."" He would later testify in court about her behavior: how she wouldn't sleep for seven or eight days at a stretch; how she would beat her head against a wall for what seemed like hours. Or while he was driving their car, she would turn to him during an argument and start pummeling the side of his head. ""I've never hit a woman in my life,"" Todd says. ""And I can't explain why I let myself be hit."" In February 1993, after two years together, they separated and Todd moved out. She claimed desertion; Todd, in filing for divorce the following month, claimed physical cruelty. By then, Barnett was pregnant with Savanna. He went into hiding, to escape what he called her endless tirades and threats. Sometimes, he slept in his car. 'I was on the run from her, hiding out at friends' houses. She'd drive around all night, looking for me, and sometimes she'd find me. She'd stand outside the house and scream that she was going to kill herself.' Barnett was diagnosed with manic . depression - now largely classified as bi-polar disorder - but refused . to get treatment, so Todd commenced custody proceedings, which carried . over after the birth of Savanna. Barnett's lawyer, Mendell Rivers, . said Barnett's 'tragic lack of self-control' in the court room lead the . judge to believe the accusations were true. In court she claimed Todd was evil and suspected he was homosexual. But the stress of the trial and the stress of being a mother was 'too much for her to handle', Rivers said. Todd was granted sole custody, with Barnett to have two supervised weekend visits a month. Dorothy Lee Barnett (pictured left in the early 1990s and right in an artists impression of her today) lost custody of her daughter Savanna to her ex-husband Benjamin Harris Todd because tests showed her to be bi-polar. Barnett and Savanna disappeared from South Carolina in 1994 but have now been found in Australia following almost 20 years on the run. Barnett has been charged and faces extradition to the U.S. It was during her fifth visitation, on April 22, 1994, that Barnett and Savanna dissappeared without a trace. It's . believed Barnett enlisted the help of Faye Yager, owner of an . organization called Children of the Underground, which helps women . escape abusive relationships. Yager uses her 'contacts' to . securely hide the women - getting friends to make small credit card . transactions all over the world, driving their car to somewhere random, . and leaving behind misleading 'clues'. Barnett had left behind a map of South America, however its believed she first fled to South Africa. When . approached on why she would help Barnett, considering there was no . evidence Todd had been abusive, Yeger said the case was 'exceptional'. Now, Barnett, 53, has been arrested . by Australian Federal Police on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland after . living under several aliases. Savanna, . now 20, who has been living under the name Samantha, was by her mothers . side during a court appearance on Wednesday, where Barnett was denied . bailed. According to The . Australian, Savanna - who has been studying nursing at a Queensland . university - held up a sign during the hearing saying 'We love you Mom'. Barnett, . who 'winked' back at her daughter, was supported by over two dozen . people, some of whom had sworn affidavits attesting to her good . character. Barnett's . barrister, Jeff Hunter QC, said his client was not a flight risk and had . a close and special relationship with the Sunshine Coast community. She has maintained a job while in Australia and managed to get a mortgage on her home. Barnett . was charged with international parental kidnapping and two counts of . false statement in a passport application after being captured on . November 4. Barnett will be extradited back to the United States to face her charges. According . to Queensland news reports, Barnett initially fled to South Africa, . where she married a man, Juan Geldenhuys, in 1995 and later gave birth . to a son, now 17, before moving to New Zealand and becoming a citizen. Five years ago she settled in Australia after splitting with Mr Geldenhuys, who recently died of bone cancer. During . her alleged time on the run, Barnett used aliases such as Alexandria . Maria Canton, federal authorities said, to evade detection. Once in March 2003 and again in March 2004, Barnett used her new name, Alexandria Maria Geldenhuys, to attempt to get a U.S. passport, according to the indictment against her. Court papers say Savanna's father was the one who lead authorities to find his ex-wife. An Australian friend of Mr Geldenhuys, Barnett's second husband, had grown suspicious of her. He heard Barnett call her daughter Savanna and she had previously spoken about escaping an abusive relationship. A simple internet search provided old photos of Barnett as wanted in relation to the disappearance of Savanna, and the Australian man was able to contact Benjamin Harris Todd. Outside court this week, Savanna- Samantha - would not comment when approached by reporters. But in an affidavit tendered to the court, Savanna described Barnett as 'an amazing woman, having raised both myself and my brother and always giving us the support we needed to become the people that we are'. Barnett, a flight attendant, and Todd got married in December 1991 in Beaufort. She filed for divorce in February 1993, alleging in court documents that Todd had left her because he was angry about her being pregnant, reports The Post and Courier. Todd countered, saying Barnett physically and emotionally abused him. That month, Todd was given temporary custody of his unborn daughter after psychiatric tests showed Barnett to be bi-polar. Savanna was born May 6, 1993. During a court-supervised visit in April 1994, the two left for a birthday party without an escort and never returned, the police reported at the time. Barnett’s disappearance prompted a probe by the FBI, which obtained a warrant for her arrest in April 1994. Artists created images depicting what Savanna and Barnett would look like as the years went on. If convicted of the charges she is facing, Barnett could spend three years in prison on the kidnapping charge and 10 years on each of the two passport counts. Barnett will next appear at an extradition hearing in Australia.","Savanna Harris Todd was allegedly kidnapped by her mom, Dorothy Lee Barnett, in 1994 when she was 11-months-old .

Arthritis sufferers have been given new hope following the success of a drug that appears to ease the crippling symptoms of the disease. Patients who took Sarilumab were more mobile and suffered less inflammation to their joints, a study found. The new treatment - involving an injection once a fortnight - also slowed progression of the incurable disease.

Scientists carried out a year-long study on 1,200 patients with active, moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have not benefited from or been . able to tolerate the side effects of current frontline treatment methotrexate. They found Sarilumba improved their condition by up to 20 per cent, according to the Daily Express. Developed by French drugmaker Sanofi and Regeneron, the new drug works by blocking an inflammation-causing protein called interleukin 6. Patients given a 200 mg dose . of Sarilumba every other week - on top of methotrexate - saw a 66 percent . improvement in the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis after six . months. Developers: The drug has been developed by French drugmaker Sanofi, above, in partnership with Regeneron . Meanwhile, those given a 150 mg dose saw . a 58 percent improvement. Reported . side effects included infections, as well as increases in 'bad' low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholestoral and transaminases. Last night, scientists, doctors and charities hailed the drug as a breakthrough in the fight against rheumetoid arthritis. A . spokesman for the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) said: . 'If this drug gives another option for those living with the disease to . lead a fuller and more productive life then this can only be a positive . development.' Meanwhile, a spokesman for . Arthritis Research UK said: 'The initial results from this trial look . quite promising in terms of reducing painful symptoms - although Sarilumab is still under development and results of this study have not . yet been published.' More than 700,000 people in the UK suffer the agonising effects of rheumatoid arthritis, in which the . body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing . inflammation and pain in the joints. Although there is currently no cure, numerous treatments are used to alleviate sufferers' pain. Common . treatments include anti-inflammatory painkillers and anti-rheumatic . drugs, such as methotrexate, which are used to slow joint damage . The success of Sarilumba pushes the new drug one step closer to the production line.

Upon closer inspection he realised what it was and saw that the shark was still alive, the moose sticking out of its mouth. ‘The moose had the fur and all the liner on it - it was about two feet long,‘ Mr Chaulk told CBS Canada. ‘He swallowed and got it halfway down and couldn't cough it back up and couldn't get it all down, and then I think the tide brought him in.’ Helping hand: Derrick Chaulk is pictured coming to the shark's aid and pushing it into deeper water . Gasping for air: The 8ft long shark was first thought to be a beached whale when it was found in the harbour . Mr Ball joined in and began pulling at the moose, which came out after a few tugs, and together they dragged the shark out into deeper water. After a few minutes, the shark started breathing and swum out into deeper water half-an-hour later to applause from the crowd that had gathered on the bank to follow its plight. ‘It was a good feeling to see that shark swim out, knowing that you saved his life,’ Mr Chaulk said. Big dinner: The shark had attempted to swallow a large chunk of moose which got stuck in its mouth . The Greenland shark is not commonly found close to shore, but swim close to the bottom in the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. It is one of the largest sharks in the world and can grow to up to 22ft. Its meat is poisonous and upon digestion it gives a similar effect as consuming large quantities of alcohol. it has been known to leave sled dogs unable to stand up.

While . they raced to the stroke victim, the warden arrived and put a parking ticket on the emergency vehicle - claiming it was causing a blockage to pedestrians. Moments later, a second ambulance pulled up in Christchurch High Street and took the elderly man to Royal Bournemouth Hospital. Richard . Day, 49, from Bransgore, was shopping with his wife and children when . he saw the parking fine on the first ambulance's windscreen. 'We were walking up the high street and saw the ambulance car parked in the lay-by,' said the father of four. 'There . were loads of cars there so the front two wheels were further than the . end of it and it was parked slightly on the pavement.

'Obviously . someone was in desperate need of emergency help so we were completely . shocked that a parking warden would issue a ticket. 'I found this absolutely incredible and my whole family were astounded.' He added: 'Plenty . of members of the public shared the same opinion and angrily shouted at . the traffic warden to have a heart and remove the ticket. But he just . walked away.' The parking ticket included a fine of between 25 and 35 pounds if paid within 14 days - increasing to between 50 and 70 pounds after that time frame. However, Dorset County Council has since revoked the ticket after liaising with South West Ambulance Service. Response: Shocked onlookers in Christchurch High Street, pictured, shouted and swore at the traffic warden . Hilary Cox, the council's . cabinet member for environment, said: 'The whole situation seems . completely ridiculous and I am gobsmacked.' But Simon . Gledhill, the council's parking services manager, claimed the ambulance had been 'obstructing the highway'. 'It was parked over the zig zags on the approach to a junction controlled by traffic lights,' he said. 'The traffic warden saw that the vehicle was causing a clear hazard to the travelling and pedestrian public. 'Emergency . vehicles are treated like any other vehicle that causes an obstruction . to the highway, unless their hazards lights are on. 'This indicates that they are on an emergency call and we will not give them a parking ticket. 'The vehicle was observed and there was nothing to indicate that this vehicle was on a call and was therefore ticketed.

A California man who was awaiting trial over the murder of six people, including four homeless men, died on Thursday after ingesting cleaning product in his jail cell. Itzcoatl Ocampo, 25, apparently accumulated the cleaning product during his time in custody, and is believed to have swallowed it on Wednesday, his attorney, Michael Molfetta, said. The death raises questions about how well Orange County jail deputies were supervising Ocampo, who had mental health issues, Mr Molfetta said. Dead: Itzcoatl Ocampo died in hospital after being found shaking and vomiting in his prison cell . The former Marine was taken to hospital on Wednesday after being found shaking and vomiting in his cell, Orange County sheriff's Lieutenant Jeff Hallock said. No cause of death was immediately given, and officials said a post-mortem examination will be performed in the coming days. Suspect: Former marine Ocampo was accused of murdering four homeless men . The Orange County district attorney's office will investigate the death, and post-mortem examination results by an independent pathologist are expected by the middle of next week, Lieutenant Hallock said. 'If you spend three minutes with Ocampo, you are acutely aware of the fact that he has some mental issues. They were severe and they were obvious and they definitely were not contrived,' Mr Molfetta said. 'With that being said, this was a guy who should have garnered the highest level of scrutiny ... and it wasn't done.' Lieutenant Hallock declined to comment on inmate supervision or the attorney's account, except to say jail deputies are required, in general, to walk by each inmate's cell a minimum of once an hour. 'We always want to prove the case in court and have justice for the victims' families,' Susan Kang Schroeder, the district attorney's chief of staff, said. Marie Middaugh, the mother of one of the victims, said in a phone interview on Friday that she was relieved to hear of Ocampo's death. 'A trial wouldn't have brought our loved ones back,' said Ms Middaugh, whose son Lloyd 'Jimmy' Middaugh, was murdered. 'I'm sorry things happened the way it did for his family because I know they're grieving, too, but I'm just glad that really it's all over.' Someone at a number listed for Ocampo's father hung up repeatedly when a reporter from AP called Friday. Prosecutors alleged that Ocampo, a native of Mexico, stabbed four homeless men in what they called a serial thrill-kill rampage in late 2011 and early 2012. Ocampo allegedly targeted his homeless victims because they were vulnerable and because he felt they were a blight on the community, authorities said. He was charged in January 2012 with four counts of murder, with special allegations of multiple murders, lying in wait and use of a deadly weapon. Victims: James McGillivray, left, and Lloyd 'Jimmy' Middaugh, right, were the first victims in the killing spree . Stabbed: Paulus 'Dutch' Smit, left, and John Berry, right, were among the homeless men murdered in LA . Three victims were stabbed more than 40 times each with a single-edged blade at least 7in long. In one instance, prosecutors, said, Ocampo selected as his next victim a homeless man who was featured in a Los Angeles Times story about the killings. Ocampo, who was discharged from the Marines in 2010, was also facing murder charges in the deaths of a school friend's mother and brother in October 2011. At the time, his family said Ocampo was a troubled man after he returned from Iraq in 2008 and he went to visit the grave of a friend who died in combat in Afghanistan twice a week. He also began drinking heavily and suffered from headaches and hand tremors, they said. His parents separated in 2010 and his father became homeless after losing his job. During the killing rampage, Ocampo visited his father on the streets and warned him about the dangers of being homeless, even showing him a picture of one of the dead men. In March 2012, Ocampo was placed temporarily on suicide watch after he began banging his head on a metal toilet in the jail. He told his attorney he was trying to stop voices as well as headaches and twitches that were bothering him, according to The Orange County Register.","Itzcoatl Ocampo was accused of stabbing four homeless men to death .

The centre, which will accommodate a range of leading services, is under construction at Guy’s Hospital in London and is due to open in 2016. Brothers Jonathan, left, and David, right, Dimbleby have donated £2million to an innovative cancer centre, to be built in honour of the distinguished broadcaster father Richard Dimbleby . The brothers donated the money through their charity, Dimbleby Cancer Care, which they have run for more than four decades.

Dimblebys were in their 20s when their father died aged 52 at St . Thomas’, which is now part of the same NHS Foundation Trust as Guy’s. They established the Richard Dimbleby Cancer Fund, which was relaunched as Dimbleby Cancer Care in 2008. Charity . staff work alongside medical professionals at the hospital to provide . support and information to anyone affected by cancer. They were one of the first charities to recognise that patients need pastoral care alongside their treatment for the disease. Mr Dimbleby added: ‘We’ve been working there for 40 years and we have always recognised ourselves as pioneering. ‘We were among the first to offer psychological support services.’ To . raise money to support the centre and fund cancer research, the . brothers are hosting a concert at St Bartholomew the Great in .

Montanans looking to save on their Thanksgiving meal this year need look no further than the side of the freeway. That's because the state passed a law on Tuesday making it legal for residents to eat roadkill. Predators, birds and sheep are the only animals not allowed to be salvaged, so turkey's not an option. But certainly you could make due with one of the 4,754 whitetail deer killed a year in the state? All you have to do is fill out a permit within 24 hours of salvaging the roadkill. What's for dinner? On Tuesday, it became legal in Montana to salvage and consume certain kinds of roadkill . Now OK to eat: . 4,754 Whitetail deer1,977 Mule deer220 Elk72 Antelope28 Moose . Still off-limits: . 39 Black bears5 Grizzly bears6 Mountain lions15 Bighorn sheep . 'Any peace officer in the state of Montana can issue a vehicle-killed wildlife salvaged permit. The Montana Highway Patrol is capable of actually printing the permits in their vehicles, we can issue the permits on the side of the road,' MHP Patrol Sergeant Jay Nelson told MTN News. If a police officer isn't present, Montanans can alternately fill out a form online. There are some rules that govern how the animals can be used, however. Road kill can only be used for one's own consumption and must not be donated, used as bait or pet food. You also must clear the road fully of all parts of the animal. Any animal still alive when found on the side of the road can only be killed if it's in season and the person has a valid hunting license. Anyone found taking roadkill without filling out the proper paperwork can be ticketed for illegal possession. Authorities warn citizens to be careful what they choose to eat off the side of the road. No turkey: Some kinds of roadkill are still illegal to eat including predators, birds of prey and sheep . 'We assume no liability whatsoever for the quality of the meat,' Mike Korn, assistant chief of law enforcement for the state Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, told WTKR. 'The conditions of the permit say you take full responsibility for the quality of the meat you salvage.' But many believe this new regulation will help feed many hungry Montanans. 'We have people that are hungry here in this country. This is a good way to supplement your food. Some of that meat's good. Yeah, some of it will be bad if it's been hit hard; but overall I think it's a wonderful program,' Jefferson City resident Don Balser said. Some 17 other states have codes regulating roadkill possession and consumption.","On Tuesday it became legal in Montana to salvage certain kinds of animals killed by vehicles .

Regarded the world over as the city of romance and the centre of bohemian culture, the French capital was unrecognisable in 1946, when American photographer Ed Clark travelled there to shoot a profile for LIFE magazine. Instead of winding passageways where art, music and food spilled out of every building, Clark was met with a city in recovery from the second global conflict in a decade. Bleak Beauty: Taken in February 1946, the images by Ed Clark show Paris as a city recovering from the ravages of the second world war, here people are pictured buying flowers from a stall near the banks of Pont Neuf .

People living on the East coast have been warned that a powerful weather system is rolling over the country from the West coast and will hit right in time for the Thanksgiving holidays. The same storm, dubbed Winter Storm Boreas, was the cause of four tragic deaths over the past few days when it swept the Western parts of the country. The system was expected to head east and reach the northern East coast area by the middle of next week, but not before hitting the Southwest again with rain, snow and wind, forecasters said. Forecast: An East Coast storm scheduled to arrive on Thanksgiving is threatening to create travel chaos for millions of Americans . Bearing the brunt: It appears as though the Eastcoast and Midwest are in for a shivery few days . They are expecting the weather to create . chaos and havoc on roads and other modes of transportation during the . busy Thanksgiving holiday season. Rain and a sudden drop in temperatures could lead to a . possible nor'easter for next week. Having already experienced . November temperatures colder than most for the last few years, brace . yourself - there are are several heavy doses ahead. Monday: A nor'easter is swirling together and it could hit the east coast just in time for Thanksgiving . Tuesday: The storm looks like it will stretch from New England down to the Carolinas, bringing snow, wind, cold, and rain along with it . Wednesday: It's a particularly dreary picture for Cape Cod. The area could receive hurricane-like gusts of wind . Thursday - Turkey Day: Given the storm's current trajectory, the nor'easter is expected to strike sometime between Tuesday evening and Thursday, during the busiest travel days of the year . Abnormally cold air will plunge into the Midwest and Northeast and there could well be a snowstorm on Turkey Day. The storm is expected to bring a lot of rain to the Northeastern United States. The first Arctic blast will arrive this weekend with another by turkey day. Chilly outlook: Arctic blasts and a developing storm are making for a frosty reception during Thanksgiving . The storm could bring strong . winds and heavy rain to much of region, with snow possible, especially . in higher-elevation areas in eastern Pennsylvania and northwest New . Jersey. Although . it will not be a crippling snowstorm for holiday travel, it has the . possibility of making air and road trips more difficult. The . storm will for the most part be gone come Thanksgiving Day in most . areas, but an impending cold front should still leave snow on the roads. Predictions: Forecasters are warning Thanksgiving travelers to beware, as a sweeping winter storm system could bring icy roads, flight delays and more headaches to the holiday next week . Disruption: The Northeast will likely see¿massive flight delays on Wednesday in all major airports, because of rain, snow and low-lying clouds that wreak havoc with flight plans . November 27 will be the 'busiest single day of travel' with 37 per cent of travelers expected to leave for the holiday.

The . potential for accumulating snow in parts of the Northeast is in play . beginning late Tuesday night, continuing through Wednesday, possibly . lingering into early Thanksgiving Day. Forecasters . say the immediate I-95 corridor from Boston to Washington, D.C. should . see mainly rain from this storm, however they are not ruling out some . light snow accumulations on the tail end of Boreas, particularly in the . western and northern suburbs. On its way: The system has already brought freezing rain, sleet and heavy snow in parts of the southern Plains and desert Southwest . Predictions: Although it's still six days away, forecasters are predicting there will be travel disruption thanks to a winter storm . Storm ahead: A NOAA satellite image taken Friday shows a storm system on the southern jet moving into the the desert southwest, producing heavy rains in Arizona and heavy mountain snow in New Mexico and Colorado . There will likely be significant delays at the major hubs of the Northeast on Wednesday, warn weather experts. The most likely swath of accumulating snow in the East from Boreas would be from the Appalachians, to much of Pennsylvania northwest of Philadelphia to New York state, western and northern New England. Early indications suggest snowfall totals would be modest, generally less than one foot in the extreme, but may be the season's first or heaviest snow of the season in many areas. Prepare: Caltrans set a up a chains required station just south of Mountain High Resort in Wrightwood, California, to warn drivers of the snow fall . But first, in the next coming days, the Winter Storm Boreas will hit the West again.

Dan Meers, of Missouri, who is married with three children, was injured due to apparent human error, his attorney said today. The 46-year-old, who has played the KC Wolf since the mascot's inception in 1989, was seriously injured Saturday while practicing for Sunday's game against the San Diego Chargers in Kansas City, Mo. Kansas City Chiefs mascot KC Wolf, aka Dan Meers, rides on a zip line before an NFL football game against the San Diego Chargers, in Kansas City, Missouri on September 13 . No description of Meers' specific injuries was available, but a longtime friend said Meers suffered a serious back injury. 'The injuries appear to be related to the manner in which a third-party company secured the riggings,' his attorney, Tim Dollar, said. 'However, an investigation is pending.' Kansas City Chiefs spokesman Ted Crews acknowledged Meers' injury on Monday but declined to give details about the accident or his condition. Dan Meers has played the KC Wolf since the mascot's inception in 1989 . While Meers doesn't perform the zip line routine every game, Dollar said, he was scheduled to do a slight variation of an entrance he'd done earlier this season. Being the mascot is a full-time job that involves making community appearances on a daily basis, Dollar said. Meers is part of a close-knit church community that's helping the family, Dollar said. 'They recognize the need to preserve evidence so that it can be investigated and prevent this thing from happening again,' Dollar said. 'Therefore it was necessary to hire counsel to take over that role while they attend to Dan.' Meers is listed as an executive committee member of the Newark, Del.-based Mascot Hall of Fame. According to its website, Meers previously performed as Fredbird, the St. Louis Cardinals' mascot, and the University of Missouri's mascot Truman the Tiger. 'Dan is one of the greatest guys on the Earth,' said Rod Handley, a Lee's Summit minister who has known Meers for 24 years. 'He has a beaming smile always on his face. He's one unbelievable guy.' Handley said Meers is a board member for Handley's ministry, Character That Counts. About 25 friends and church members were at the hospital Sunday when Meers had back surgery, Handley said. 'These are not minor injuries,' Handley said. 'This is very serious.' Kansas City Chiefs mascot KC Wolf hangs upside down from a cable over the field on September 15 .

France's Socialist government today threatened to stop private companies paying their executives too much. In a move which will be met with widespread anger in the corporate world, Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said 'we will have to legislate' if salaries and other benefits are too high. Mr Moscovici was reacting to a decision by PSA Peugeot Citroen CEO Philippe Varin to finally turn down a £17.5m pension pot. 'We will have to legislate': French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici (left) and the socialist government have threatened to stop private companies paying their executives too much after PSA Peugeot Citroen CEO Philippe Varin (right) finally decided to turn down a £17.5m pension pot . The loss-making car company wanted to reward Mr Varin with the vast sum, but changed its mind following an outcry from mainly left-wing critics. 'It was a wise decision,' said Mr Moscovici. 'I've always said, and this is the government's position, that we first of all have to make sure that self -regulation works. 'If it does not, then we will have to legislate. What happened yesterday does not change that.' Mr Moscovici is a key lieutenant of President Francois Hollande, who famously said 'I don't like the rich' during his election campaign last year. He has since attempted to introduce a top rate of income tax of 75 per cent, leading to a number of high-profile entrepreneurs and celebrities moving abroad. Cash-strapped company: Under Mr Varin's stewardship of Peugeot some 11,000 job losses were made and a pay freeze enforced sparking staff demonstrations outside the PSA Peugeot Citroen headquarters in Paris last year . Meanwhile, the French economy has gone into crisis, with unemployment and the cost of living spiralling. Opinion polls meanwhile indicate that Mr Hollande is by far the most unpopular president in the history of France and somebody very few people trust to run a major European country. Mr Hollande has backed the scuppering of the Peugeot boss's pension pot, saying it was 'a wise decision', adding: 'That is the least one can say.' He was backed by other senior politicians, including Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg who said companies should not over pay. Mr Montebourg said: 'There should be a bit more self-discipline among those awarding themselves obscene salaries and unacceptable perks. But all the evidence points to that not happening.' Mr Montebourg said the government had been able to put pressure on Peugeot over Mr Varin's package because it receives support from the state. Right idea: French president Francois Hollande (right) said it was a 'wise decision' and backed the scuppering of the Peugeot boss' pension pot, as has Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg (left) 'For private companies, if self-discipline does not work, the legislature is perfectly entitled to proceed to regulation,' said Montebourg. Mr Varin will retire as Peugeot chief next year, and has now completely waived his right to his proposed package, which would have provided an annual pension worth some 280,000 a year. Under his stewardship, Peugeot has announced some 11,000 job losses, and implemented a pay freeze.","French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said 'we will have to legislate'

A cousin of Samantha Cameron has arrived in court to sue his family for 25 years of income from their Hampshire estate. Old Etonion, John . Sheffield, 50, second cousin of the prime minister's wife, claims he . has not received any money from his late grandfather's 1,000-acre . property despite being granted a 25 per cent stake in 1983. Now, . five years after the death of his grandfather, son of the sixth baronet . of Normanby, the Old Etonion is suing his father Julian for a quarter . of a century's worth of rent, farm yields and shooting rights fees. Battle: John Sheffield, left, is suing has taken his father Julian, right, to court for 25 years' worth of income . Laverstoke House in Hampshire on 1,000-acre estate at the centre of the row between the aristocratic Sheffield family . Mr Sheffield, who like Samantha Cameron is a great-grandchild of the sixth baronet, is also suing the executors of his grandfather's estate and the trustees of the agreement made in 1968 when it was established. Eason Rajah QC, representing his father, Julian Sheffield, told the court that John has 'gradually cut himself off from his family' over the past 18 years, believing his parents were 'responsible for physical abuse he believes he suffered at the hands of one of his nannies'. The estate was established by John’s grandfather - John Vincent Sheffield - in 1968 'in the fervent wish' that Julian and his heirs 'would continue to own and look after the estate for future generations', the court heard. Mr Sheffield, who died aged 95 in 2008, . was the youngest son of the sixth baronet of Normanby, who 'rescued the . family fortunes' after the Sheffields were threatened by crippling death . duties following World War Two. Julian, now 74, followed his father into . bank notes manufacturing business, Portals, where he later became . chairman, and is now facing his own son across a tense courtroom. Family feud: Samantha Cameron's second cousin is suing his father in a feud over a Hampshire estate . During an enormously costly 10-day trial Mr Rajah insisted that Julian and his father had acted in good faith throughout and that John had always understood that his share in the family trust that holds the estate was given to him by his grandfather in 1983 'as part of succession and tax planning'. 'The (family) understood John and his grandfather had reached an understanding at the time of the gift that John would allow his grandfather to receive all the income from the estate while he was alive,' said the QC. 'They understood that his grandfather and his wife would continue to occupy their home at New Barn House, on the estate, and generally he would be treated during his lifetime as if he was still the owner'. 'John says nobody told him his rights,' said Mr Rajah, but the barrister argued that the astute economics graduate 'was party to the gift and knew and understood what he was signing'. There was, in any case, 'no dispute' that the estate’s trustees are 'bound to account' to John in respect of his 25 percent share from May 2008 - the date of his grandfather’s death, said Mr Rajah. Julian insisted in court that his son had been well aware of the true position, adding that he was in line to receive 'a huge benefit - because he would ultimately own 25 per cent of a valuable estate'. Father and son sat in court just yards apart - separated by a document-strewn desk. Two of John’s siblings - Simon Sheffield and Nicola Graham - also stepped into the witness box to back their father’s account. Mrs Graham, 40, recounted a conversation with her grandfather, when she was aged 16, in which he 'told me he was passing on his interest in the estate to John but that he was to keep all the income until he died'. 'I remember thinking how lovely it was that John - who at the time was a lovely person and full of life and a great older brother - that the estate would be passed onto the next generation through him,' she told the court. John Sheffield (1648-1721), the first Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, whose heirs include Samantha Cameron and John Sheffield, who is now suing his family in a claim that could run into millions . Mrs Graham, who described her grandfather as a 'wonderful man', said he had told her his plan because he 'wanted to share it with me'. John had for years accepted the status quo without demur, claimed Mr Rajah, and his father had described him as 'everything we could have wished for in an eldest son'. However, by the end of the 1990s, family relations were becomingly increasingly strained, the court heard, prompting group therapy sessions 'in an attempt to reconcile the family’ relationship with John'. The family had also made 'strenuous efforts' to mediate the dispute before reaching court, but without success, said Mr Rajah. The dispute has its origins in 2005 when John first challenged his father and grandfather about his entitlement to a quarter share of the estate’s income. John’s QC, Christopher Pymont, said it was never spelt out in 1983 that his grandfather was retaining his right to income from the estate. 'The point of the trust is to effect a gift. There was no word about reserving for John’s grandfather a life interest in the income of that trust,' he said. 'Although they knew that the gift was made and, indeed, intended the gift to be made, they didn’t follow it through and give effect to the rights that the gift gave to John.' The barrister said that, having gifted John his 25 percent share, but with his grandfather still needing income from the estate, the trustees were left having to 'square the circle'. He added: 'What they actually did was ignore John from thenceforth.' Judge Mark Pelling QC has now reserved his ruling on the case.

Parental leave rules are to be torn up to smash the ‘old-fashioned assumption’ that women rather than men should stay at home to look after young children. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will today unveil plans to allow new mothers and fathers to share leave – meaning men will be able to take almost a year off work. Mr Clegg, who took an extended period of paternity leave when his first son was born,  said the current system, which means a father can only take a fortnight off after the birth of a child, was ‘Edwardian’. His wife Miriam returned to work first, but admitted she relied on an army of helpers ‘making my life possible’. The proposals have been the subject of a fierce Coalition argument and have split the business community. The . Institute of Directors condemned them as a ‘nightmare for small . businesses’ but the Confederation of British Industry said it was . pleased the Government had listened to concerns about the system. Mr . Clegg’s plans will anger some Conservatives, who argue firms cannot be . expected to cope with more rights for employees as the economy comes out . of recession. From April . 2015, parents will be able to share 52 weeks of leave. New mothers will . have to use the first two weeks, deemed important for recovery and . bonding with their baby. But they will be able to transfer the rest of the time off to their partner – meaning he can tell his employer he wants as many as 50 weeks off. Alternatively, parents could each take 25 weeks concurrently – or opt for one to take a period of time off and then the other. But Tories have insisted that businesses have the right to make parents take leave in a continuous stretch if they deem coming and going over the year is too disruptive. The proposals have been the subject of a fierce Coalition argument and have split the business community . The right to shared leave will only apply to couples who both work. The first 39 weeks of shared leave will be paid at the statutory minimum, with the last 13 weeks unpaid. Fathers will be guaranteed the right to return to the same job after up to 26 weeks off, but could be offered a different, equivalent post if they are away for longer. An employee will be required to give their employer eight weeks’ notice of their intention to take leave. There will be a cap on requesting separate blocks of time off – at three per employee. Ministers say the measures will offer flexibility to modern families where women are as likely as men to be the main breadwinner. Mr Clegg argued that the new system will drive a ‘real cultural shift’, reducing the impact of pregnancy on women’s careers and helping working fathers play a greater role in childcare. When his eldest son Antonio, 11, was born in 2002, the Lib Dem leader took an extended period of paternity leave so wife Miriam could return to work first. He took two weeks’ paternity leave after the birth of son Miguel, in 2009 and also when Alberto, eight, was born. But his wife has previously revealed that she has an army of helpers to enable the family to juggle work and childcare. Mrs Clegg said she was able to rely on ‘a lot of shadows behind me making my life possible’, including a nanny ‘who is almost like my aunt and gives me orders’. The Deputy Prime Minister said:  ‘Women deserve the right to pursue their goals and not feel they have to choose between having a successful career or having a baby. 'They should be supported by their employers, rather than being made to feel less employable or under pressure to take unchallenging jobs.’ He added: ‘We need to challenge the old-fashioned assumption that women will always be the parent that stays at home – many fathers want that option too.’ Mr Clegg condemned existing ‘outdated Edwardian parental leave laws’, adding that ‘the whole economy is suffering because we’re not giving women more opportunities to combine family and work’. Alexander Ehmann, of the Institute of Directors, said the proposals heaped ‘yet more burdens on struggling employers at a time when government should be freeing them to create jobs and wealth’. ‘The proposed system is considerably more complex and unwieldy … and employers will, once again, have to absorb the cost of adapting and implementing this new system,’ he added. The TUC’s Frances O’Grady warned that unless leave is backed up with better pay ‘couples simply won’t be able to afford to take it’.

A woman has lost eight stone after photographs of herself at her son's graduation left her mortified. As a nurse, changing shift patterns, late nights and then a fight against cancer meant Julie Oliver, 48, had let her weight creep up to 18st and was wearing a size 22/24 dress at her largest. But, after seeing a photo of herself during her son Liam’s graduation and then another snap of herself on holiday in the Canary Islands just a few months later, Julie was shamed into losing the weight for good. Julie Oliver, 48, was shamed into losing 8 stone after seeing photos of herself at son's graduation - now she is a trim size 8 and weighs 10st . Now Julie, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, is the slimmest she has been since she was 12 years old and, after recently celebrating her 30th wedding anniversary, is the slimmest her husband Pat, 54, has ever known her. The mother-of-three began putting on weight after her sons Ryan, 27, Liam, 24, and Blaine, 21, were born. Speaking about her weight gain, Julie said: 'Having three young boys to look after meant I grabbed food whenever I had a free hand. It would either be a block of cheese, half a pack of biscuits, or crisps.' When Julie started working shifts as a nurse from the age of 28, it was detrimental to her health. 'The night shifts were the worst,' said Julie. Inspiration: After seeing this photo of herself during her son Liam's graduation, Julie was shamed into losing the weight for good . Shamed: Julie was also mortified when she saw photos of herself on holiday and decided it was time to join a slimming club . 'All the nurses would bring in biscuits and ready meals and I’d snack constantly through the night. I’d then have breakfast before going home, nibbling on cheese and biscuits. I was eating 24 hours a day.' By her early forties, Julie’s weight had shot up to 16st 5lb. She had high blood pressure and in 2000 was put on beta blockers. In 2008 Julie’s world fell apart when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Following surgery for a partial mastectomy and to have all of her lymph nodes removed, Julie underwent chemotherapy and was also put on steroids. 'I ate a lot of comfort food during this time. Because of the side effects of the chemotherapy I suffered a sore painful mouth, so I’d eat soft food such as mashed potato covered in butter and cheese. 'Friends were also keen to take me . out for lunch two or three times a week. We’d have a cup of tea and a . slice of cake or calorific cream tea. My weight was soon pushing 17st.' After . chemotherapy, Julie embarked on a course of radiotherapy and a course . of Tamoxifen, and was told that one of the side effects was weight gain. All the medication she was taking caused a lot of joint pain. 'Suddenly . basic activities like getting out of the chair and climbing the stairs . were very painful and added to my weight problems; I was so depressed,' added Julie. New lease: 'Since losing the weight I feel like I've now got my whole life ahead of me,' she said . Her biggest fan: She reached her goal weight in June 2012 and her husband loves her new look . So, when she found out that the cancer hadn’t spread and the gruelling treatment was over, whilst she was elated at the news, she no longer recognised herself in the mirror. At her son Liam’s graduation in October 2010, she felt horrendous. None of her clothes fitted and she opted for a black and yellow dress in a size 24 and a black cardigan to cover herself. But it was on holiday in Tenerife in March 2011 where Julie reached her lowest point. 'I had to buy a pair of size 24 shorts, which were the biggest pair I could find, and I felt miserable all holiday,' she said. 'The weather was rubbish, I was 18st and no longer felt like me. 'I was depressed and had a negative . view of my body. I couldn’t bear to look at myself in the mirror but I . vowed that having survived breast cancer, and having been through three . major operations in my quest to overcome it, I wasn’t going to let the . side effects of all the medication, surgery and treatment rob me of my . life.' Instead, on her . return from her holiday, Julie went along to the joined the Rosemary . Conley Diet & Fitness Clubs in Welwyn and St Albans, where she lost . just under a stone in the first month. Julie . started exercising and soon started attending five classes a week. By . January 2012, her blood pressure tablets were halved and by May 2012, . they were stopped altogether. Indulging: When she met with friends, they would have a cup of tea and a slice of cake or calorific cream tea. Her weight was soon pushing 17st . Who am I ? When she found out that the cancer hadn't spread and the gruelling treatment was over, whilst she was elated at the news, she no longer recognised herself in the mirror . She reached her goal weight in June 2012 and has since lost another half stone – taking her to 10st. 'It’s reassuring to know that I’m a much healthier person. I was at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which runs in my family, but I’ve dramatically reduced my risk, I’ve reduced the risk of cancer returning and now feel more like a 32 year old than someone soon to turn 50. 'The best compliment so far though has to be when I was out celebrating my anniversary with my husband. I went to the bar to buy some drinks and a man came up to me and said: ""Wow, you have the most amazing legs."" To which I replied: ""That’s what my husband says."" His face was a picture. 'Since losing the weight I feel like I’ve now got my whole life ahead of me. 'When I was overweight and diagnosed with cancer, I never thought I’d live to see any of this but now I’m so excited about what lies ahead of me and best of all, I have a new size 8 wardrobe to go with my new lifestyle.'","Julie Oliver, 48, was 18st and wore size 24 dress .

An overweight student was shamed into losing eight stone after getting wedged in a lecture seat on her first day of university. Megan Longdon, 20, from Bristol, weighed 17st 5lbs when she started law school at the University of the West of England after years of gorging on takeaways, chocolate and crisps. She was a dress size 24 and was mortified when she attended her first lecture last September and found herself wedged in her seat when it was time to leave. Slimmed down: Megan Longdon lost 8st in 11 months, left, after she once tipped the scales at 17st 5lbs . She was forced to wait while fellow students climbed over her to leave before she could wriggle herself free. She recalls: 'I was just stuck in the arm bits on my hip area, I had the table bit in front of me to lean on, there was not a huge gap. I was making excuses trying to pack my stuff away as slowly as possible so it didn't look like I was stuck. 'People . were a bit confused as to what I was doing and the fact I was telling . them to climb over me, I didn't know anyone so it was really . embarrassing. Wake-up call: The law student's diet used to consist mainly of chocolate and takeaways and she was mortified when she once got stuck in a chair . 'Luckily there wasn't another lecture coming in afterwards so I had enough time to prise myself out. 'I . stopped going to university for weeks after it happened I was so . embarrassed, I missed out on making all my friends and a lot of work, it . was awful.' The humiliation in September left the aspiring lawyer determined to slash her daily intake of calories and turn her life around. 'I . stopped going to university for weeks after it happened I was so . embarrassed, I missed out on making all my friends and a lot of work, it . was awful' She said of her weight: 'It stopped me making a lot of friends during my first year, I didn't socialise at all really. 'It . took a while but I finally decided I couldn't hide in my room and do . nothing, I needed to go back and do something about it.' She used to binge on chocolate, bagels, . crisps and croissants before school, followed by more chocolate and . sandwiches for lunch. After . school she would tuck into yet more crisps before going home for a . generous helping of a home-cooked dinner with yet more chocolate from a . stash in her room. To add to her woes, Megan would often eat takeaways and kebabs because her mother's former partner hated cooking. Diet overhaul: Megan swapped her calorific snacks for fruit and dropped from a dress size 24 to 8 . But since swapping calorie-crammed . snacks for salads, fruit and a healthy breakfast after joining Slimming World, Megan has trimmed inches . off her waist. She lost 12lbs in the first week of her diet which she said helped to motivate her to stick with it even though she admits 'it was a bit hard at first to get things in moderation.' But she stuck with it and continued to slim down losing eight stone in 11 months. She's now 9st 5lbs, a dress size 8, bringing her total weightloss to eight stone. She's now also started exercising to keep the weight off. Changed woman: Megan is now also exercising to keep the weight off and has never felt better . She said: 'I didn't exercise while I was losing weight but I now doing fitness training. I have a personal trainer twice a week and I go to the gym twice a week too.' The student said the weightloss has boosted her confidence and has also helped the rest of her family get in shape - her grandparents and mother have all lost weight as a result of her new healthy eating regime. Megan said: 'It's so good to finally get back to 'normal' again.

"By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 19:39 EST, 24 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:40 EST, 24 November 2013 . MPs have given themselves an extra week's holiday next year - because of the Scottish independence referendum. The House of Commons authorities announced that MPs would sit for just 145 days in 2014, although a few more Friday sittings will be added once decisions have been made. But the total will be a week less than this year, because they will give themselves time off around 18 September, when the referendum is held. The change has occurred because the Lib Dems, who would normally hold their party conference in the third week of September, had to move their gathering so as not to clash with the vote. Time off: The House of Commons authorities announced that MPs would sit for just 145 days in 2014 . Their conference will now be held in October next year, necessitating a week off at Westminster. But the week off which usually happens in September will not be scrapped. Taking into account bank holidays and annual leave, most people work around 224 days in a year - around 15 weeks more than MPs will be expected to at Westminster. The move to change the parliamentary timetable for the referendum has been blasted by critics. They point out it will affect the hundreds of English, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs who have no interest in the Scottish question. Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Cutting the number of days Parliament is sitting further undermines the ability of MPs to hold the Government and ministers to account.' The sitting dates for 2014 were . announced by Lib Dem Tom Brake. It's because his party has moved its . autumn conference to accommodate the independence vote that MPs look set . to spend even fewer days in Westminster next year. The . Lib Dems were due to have their Glasgow get-together before the . referendum but switched it to October to avoid a clash. But instead of . moving the customary 'conference recess' back a week, it's been . extended. Allowances: MPs will get additional time off around the Scottish independence referendum, the for vote led by Scottish National Party Leader Alex Salmond and Deputy Leader Nicola Sturgeon, pictured . Labour's Shadow leader of the House, Angela Eagle, said: 'I understand why the Scottish referendum has disrupted the usual arrangements but it seems a bit strange that we have had to make changes to accommodate the 2014 Liberal Democrats conference. 'At the rate they are losing members, next year they could hold it in a telephone box.' MPs spend four days a week in Westminster. There are a number of Friday sittings each year yet to be announced which will boost the 145 day total. However, it's likely MPs will also award themselves around a week off for prorogation - the lead up to the State Opening of Parliament by the Queen in May that is likely to coincide with campaigning for the European elections. The Conservative's slogan for their party conference this year was 'For Hardworking People'.","MPs to sit for fewer days in 2014, with more Fridays still due to be added .

Anger: Labour councillor Steven Bayes is said to be furious after being arrested for gross indecency . The deputy chairman of the Co-op group’s board of directors was once arrested in a Belfast hotel room with his then teenage boyfriend for  suspected gross indecency. Labour councillor Steven Bayes, who had been tipped to succeed Lord Prescott as a Hull MP before the incident, was detained because his partner was under the legal age of consent at the time. The disclosure came as Co-op members yesterday voiced their concerns about the company at a meeting in York following the scandal over Paul Flowers. But Co-op spokesmen said no criticisms of board members were discussed during the North Area Committee meeting, attended by about 70 delegates. Mr Bayes, a long-standing Hull city councillor, was held on suspicion of gross indecency and other offences when police raided the Holiday Inn hotel where he was staying in 2007. The former chairman of the Humberside Police Authority was in the city with his 17-year-old partner Dale Martin, whom he had met on the internet. At the time the age of consent for gay sex in the province was 18, though it has subsequently been reduced to 16 to fall in line with the rest of the UK. The Public Prosecution Service decided to take no action, saying it was not in the public interest. But Mr Bayes was suspended by the Labour Party in Hull for several months and withdrew from the process of selecting a successor to former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott, who stepped down as MP for Hull East in 2010. The openly gay councillor and Mr Martin, with whom he now lives, tried to take legal action against the police and prosecution authorities in Northern Ireland, saying their actions had been discriminatory and breached their rights to privacy. But their bid for a judicial review failed, largely because of delays in applying for it. Mr Bayes, 52, later criticised the police handling of the case, which had included searches of his home, the Guildhall in Hull and the House of Commons where he had worked as a researcher  for an MP. He was quoted as saying: ‘The police just came in with their big stomping feet all over everything and didn’t look at it, bearing in mind the law was changing.’ Mr Bayes, who was paid £34,000 last year for his work for the  Co-op, joined the board in 2009. Work: Mr Bayes, who joined the co-op board in 2009, earned £34,000 for his work last year (library image) Yesterday’s North Area Committee meeting in York reflected the growing unrest in the company over the revelations about Flowers, with an item headed the The Current Situation Facing The Co-operative Group. One delegate standing for election to the committee wrote in the agenda: ‘Recent activity has resulted in diminishing the Co-op brand and I believe our Boards now need new, proactive members.’ But a reporter from this newspaper was told he could not attend the event, despite the public interest. Regional secretary Ed Powell said: ‘We have nothing to hide but it is a private meeting.’ In response to questions about the content of the agenda, he said: ‘The situations facing the Co-op are well publicised in the media. ‘We are going to speak to our members about the various situations facing the Co-op including concerns of the members. ‘Otherwise it is a training and development meeting held twice a year, which is in the diary.’ He refused to comment on Mr Bayes. The programme included a warning to delegates from Mark Craig, the director of corporate relations, not to speak to the media, saying: ‘It is clearly essential that you adhere to the Group’s Code of Conduct at all times.’ He added: ‘We anticipate further media coverage. We are mindful of the need to communicate with elected members and plan to do so early next week.’ Co-op spokesman Russ Brady said: ‘It is a private meeting but the members will want to sit down and discuss among themselves their fears and feelings and talk about the allegations. One of the benefits of the Co-op as an organisation is that they will have the opportunity to do this.’ He said the revelations had been like ‘shock and awe’ and ‘the worst week of my career’ but added that ‘the Co-op does a great many things which are of benefit to the community’. Delegates leaving the meeting at the Novotel in York last night declined to comment in detail. One said: ‘We’ve had a very good day. Very positive.’ Another replied: ‘A good day – we’re getting it sorted out.’ The Co-op said: ‘There were no charges brought against Mr Bayes so there is no comment.’ Last night Mr Bayes could not be reached for comment.","Councillor Steven Bayes tipped to succeed Lord Prescott as a Hull MP .

More than just setting assorted gems, Rosenthal uses pavés as a method for creating multidimensional objects. Much like a painter, he uses various tones of colored stones to shade and highlight the figures he’s setting, which typically take the shape of flowers and butterflies. Rosenthal’s creative instincts began in needlepoint – another craft in which he is an expert. He is one of very few jewelers to set his pieces in dark alloy metals, which he says exemplify the hues and shine of his colored gems. The jeweler is famously reclusive and has only exhibited his work once before, in London. He produces somewhere between 100 and 120 one-of-a-kind pieces a year in the interest of artistry, rather than widespread commercial success. Incredible auction success: While Rosenthal does not advertise, his items are so coveted that they can fetch more than two times their original price at auction . After graduating from Harvard, . Rosenthal moved to Paris in 1966 and opened a needlepoint store in the . French capital with his romantic partner Pierre Jeannet. While . his handiwork was sought after by design houses including Hermès and . Valentino, it wasn’t long before Rosenthal’s interest in jewelry rose to . the forefront of his mind. After clients asked him to reset their finer pieces, Rosenthal decided to reinvest his focus in jewelry and moved back to New York in 1976 to work for Bulgari. He quickly returned to Paris and . opened JAR on the Place Vendôme in 1978 as an upstart venture, with just . three rings made from less costly materials like moonstone and coral. Less than ten years later, Rosenthal . moves his operations to a larger space in the famous French plaza where . he continues to operate today, on an appointment-only basis. Needlepoint start: The designer's formative experience with needlepoint inspires his work like a 1994 Butterfly Brooch (L) and a 2008 Tulip Brooch (R) Rosenthal has been called the ‘Fabergé . of our time,’ by designer Diane von Furstenberg and the ‘single . greatest jewelry of our time,’ by former loyal client Ellen Barkin, who . purchased more than a dozen of his pieces while married to billionaire . Ron Perelman. The creator: Joseph Rosenthal (above) is now 70 years old, but he says he has no intention of selling his company . Unlike other jewelry designs which . depreciate in value after their original purchase, Rosenthal’s creations . have been shown to typically double in value when auctioned. His investment-worthy proven objects have been favored by Gwyneth Paltrow and Elle MacPherson. Rosenthal is famously finicky about . who is allowed to buy his designs, and he is known to refuse purchase . when he thinks an item is not befitting of its buyer. The designer is so particular in fact, that for the only other retrospective of his . work to have ever been staged (at London’s Somerset House in 2002), he . required that the exhibition space  remain nearly pitch black and for the . museum to provide each visitor with a flashlight so they could discover . their own favorite focal points. He also required that the space be . scented with his signature JAR scents, which are only presently sold in . two locations – a small store in Paris and at Bergdorf Goodman in New . York for $472 per ounce. The MET exhibit will run until March 9, in the museum’s Helen and Milton A. Kimmelman Gallery.","The exhibit marks the MET's first retrospective of a living jewelry designer's work .

Jamie Oliver is pulling the plug on his signature range of artisan food amid multi-million pound  losses and bitter criticism from  his suppliers. Reputed to be the world’s richest chef with a personal fortune of £150 million, Mr Oliver launched his ‘Jme’ food range amid great fanfare two years ago. The collection of sauces, biscuits and jams were said to be a ground-breaking collaboration between the TV cook and a hand-picked group  of independent, small-scale food producers in Britain and Italy. But despite being stocked in over 150 retailers, poor sales have left Jme owing parent group Jamie Oliver Ltd £14 million – some £6 million of which is unlikely to be repaid. Jme made losses of £3.8 million in 2012, double its deficit of £1.9 million the year before. Mr Oliver is to discontinue the range by the end of the year. Suppliers and wholesalers confirmed they were sent an email informing them the line was ending, leading some producers to attack Jme’s ‘commercial ineptitude’ and ‘poor branding’. One producer claims he is still owed money by Jme and said his final dealings with the business had left a ‘sour taste’ in his mouth. ‘We had a lot of difficulties with them,’ said Gary Reid, of shortbread bakers Reids of Caithness. ‘I’m not going to be harsh on Jamie Oliver because the failure is down to his team. I’m still sitting on about £1,000 of packaging they wanted that I’ll never get reimbursed for.’ Mr Reid accused the chef’s business associates of being ‘unprofessional’ and described many of the decisions made by those in charge of the Jme brand as ‘commercial madness’. ‘To be honest, I’m not surprised the range has been cut,’ he added. ‘It turned out to be a really poor business. Many of their buyers ignored top-quality importers who wanted to take our products on abroad. ‘It’s such a shame because the brand had such potential. I’ve been so furious about it. ‘We made some money from it,  but . we’ve also lost money from it. It’s not good when high-profile brands . are doing that to small businesses.’ Another . supplier, who preferred to remain anonymous said: ‘I’m not surprised at . all the range did not do well. They had no idea about the commercial . world. It was ridiculous. By the end I was pulling my hair out.’ Discontinued: A range of products from JME Foods - which made significant losses and will be discontinued by the end of the year . The group is also to withdraw Jme homeware from stores, although the products will still be marketed through direct selling parties in individuals’ homes, and online. A spokesman for Mr Oliver last night confirmed that the foods range would  be discontinued from 2014, but added: ‘The food was always a very small part of what the Jme range offers. ‘It was decided the  focus should be on the bigger, more successful, homewares range sold through direct selling  and online. ‘We are not aware of owing any suppliers money but if they would like to approach us directly as opposed to through the media, the Jme team will investigate.’","£150m chef launched his 'Jme' food range two years ago .

Murderer: Peter Sutcliffe, pictured, is in prison having been convicted of 13 murders, but retired officer Chris Clark says he could have committed more . Notorious serial killer Peter Sutcliffe could be responsible for as many as 17 more murders, a retried detective has claimed. Chris Clark, formerly of Norfolk Police, has reviewed dozens of unsolved murders during the period Sutcliffe was at large, and claims to have found 'circumstantial evidence' linking him to the crimes. He said the 'frenzied nature' of the killings, whose victims include housewives, prostitutes, a teacher and two pregnant women, leads him to believe Sutcliffe - also known as the Yorkshire Ripper - could be behind them. Although the 13 murders Sutcliffe was convicted of all took place in Yorkshire and Greater Manchester, Mr Clark believes his work as a lorry driver could have given him the opportunity to kill all around the country. He told the Daily Star Sunday: 'I have been able to piece together strands of evidence and I can show that he knew, or had been to, the areas where attacks occurred. 'I intend to take my evidence to the Home Office and hope they will reopen the cases. 'It is inconceivable to believe he didn't attack elsewhere. He had the ability to drive around the UK at will and this gave him the perfect cover.' Mr Clark has compiled a dossier of evidence connected to the cases - which date from 1968 to 1980 - and intends to hand it over to the authorities for investigation. Extra victims? Alison Morris, right, was murdered in 1975. Chris Clark thinks Sutcliffe, pictured right driving in his lorry, could have been responsible . Serial killer: A police document from the Ripper investigations shows the 13 whose murders Peter Sutcliffe has been accused of . The murder victims - who are all female - . include Gloria Booth, a 29-year-old housewife found strangled in . north-west London in 1971, pregnant mother-of-two Lynda Farrow, who was . stabbed repeatedly in 1979, and teenager Patsy Morris. Miss Morris's . body was found discarded in the undergrowth in London grassland in June . 1980. Two of the victims under Mr Clark's consideration have never been identified - one of whom was found decapitated in Norfolk in August 1974. The other was found on the North Yorkshire Moors. The cases identified by Mr Clark have all baffled investigators. A soldier was found guilty of murdering 14-year-old Judith Roberts, but the conviction was later quashed by the court of appeal. Cold case: Former intelligence officer Chris Clark, above, believes Sutcliffe can be linked to Alison's case . A teenager was convicted of the murder of . Wendy Sewell, who was killed in Derby in 1973, and spent 27 years in . jail, but was eventually cleared of the charge. Detectives looking in to some of the murders specifically ruled out Sutcliffe as a suspect at the time. But Mr Clark believes the officers underestimated how far he could travel and how quickly he could kill, which could make him a feasible suspect in the murders. Sutcliffe, now 67, is a prisoner at Broadmoor Hospital after being given 20 life sentences.","Chris Clark, formerly of Norfolk Police, has compiled evidence .

Sexual escapades: Black Guerilla Family gang leader, Tavon White, allegedly had sex with four corrections officers inside the prison who helped him peddle drugs. He has pleaded guilty to the charges . Almost 30 Baltimore corrections officers have now been indicted on federal charges for working in cahoots with members of a notorious prison gang to peddle drugs, phones and sex inside the city’s jail. The new indictment this week adds 14 more officers to the group of 13 who were indicted in April, bringing the total to 27. The controversy reads like a script from the HBO crime drama, The Wire, but the US Attorney’s office for Maryland says it has gone too far for too long. ‘Correctional officers were in bed with BGF inmates,’ said U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein. One of the guards even had the name of the Black Guerilla Family gang leader, Tavon White, 36, tattooed on her wrist,. White had a sexual relationship with four female jail guards while he was incarcerated, according to an indictment. Another female officer reportedly had his name tattooed on the back of her neck. He allegedly fathered five children with the female guards, who were identified as Jennifer Owens, 31, Katera Stevenson, 24, Chania Brooks, 27, and Tiffany Linder, 27. Linde made her first appearance in April when she was eight-months pregnant with White's child and pleaded not guilty, according to WBALTV. Scroll down for video... Pregnant: Jail guard Tiffany Linde made her first appearance in April when she was eight-months pregnant with White's child and pleaded not guilty . He impregnated the three other women as well, all of whom helped him smuggle items into prison, according CNN. In January, White had been heard talking on a cell phone that had been smuggled in, saying, ‘This is my jail. You understand that? I'm dead serious. ... I make every final call in this jail ... and nothing go past me. ... Any of my brothers that deal with anybody, it's gonna come to me. Before (somebody) stab somebody, they gotta run it through me,’ White said, according to the indictment. White, who also goes by the name Bulldog, pleaded guilty to the federal racketeering conspiracy charges in August. The correctional officers were allegedly bribed to smuggle in drugs, cell phones and other prohibited objects, which they hid underneath their clothes, ‘inside body cavities’, such as their vaginas, and in sandwiches, the indictment said. The families of the inmates who weren't part of the gang had to pay protection money, authorities claim. 'My jail': White is heard saying on the phone that he runs Baltimore City's detention centre where he impregnated four correctional officers . TV material: The prison controversy is like a scene taken out of the police crime show The Wire, starring Dominic West, Larry Gilliard Jr., and Wendell Pierce . ‘Court documents allege the BGF members recruited correctional officers through personal and often sexual relationships, as well as bribes, and that some officers traded sex for money,’ the U.S. Attorney's Office said in its news release. Rosenstein's office said the criminal organization was enabling those involved to ‘make large amounts of money through drug trafficking, robbery, assault, extortion, bribery, witness retaliation, money laundering and obstruction of justice’. The investigation first came to light in April with the announcement of the first round of arrests. The Black Guerrilla Family (also known as the Black Family or the Black Vanguard) is a prison and street gang founded in 1966 by George Jackson and W.L. Nolen while they were incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison in Marin County, California, north of San Francisco. In all, 44 people have been indicted on federal charges.

Terry Atkinson from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, who had £150,000 paid into his bank account from Npower . With profits of half-a-million pounds a day thanks to record prices, it's perhaps no surprise that an energy giant would fail to notice a mere £150,000 going astray. But when the six-figure sum from Npower popped up unexpectedly in amateur actor Terry Atkinson's bank account, it was a moment of eye-rubbing disbelief - not least as he isn't even one of their customers. Despite living in a shared house and working in a call centre as he pursues his dream of a professional drama career, the 30-year-old resisted temptation and informed his bank there must have been a mistake. However, as of last night, the small fortune - just about enough to cover the chief executive's annual bonus - was last night still sitting in his account waiting to be recalled by the German-owned multinational. Yesterday Mr Atkinson said the astonishing oversight showed the Big Six energy giants were making so much money that the small matter of a missing £150,000 was barely worth chasing. 'They probably spend that sort of money on a corporate night out, yet it could heat thousands of pensioners' homes this winter,' he said. 'People are having to go hungry because their energy bills are so high, and yet Npower can transfer a vast sum of money by a casual mistake and not even notice. 'What's particularly scary is that I haven't been one of their customers for five years, so how have they even got my details?' Mr Atkinson checked his online NatWest account on Tuesday expecting it have less than £70 remaining. Instead, he was stunned to see his balance swollen by a payment of £151,786.69 from Npower. 'I couldn't believe my eyes,' said. 'At first I thought: ""Have I won the Lottery?"" 'I phoned my bank and they said: ""Don't spend it yet"". I told them not to worry, I had no intention of spending it. 'Npower make millions of pounds a day, they could quite easily afford to take me to court and accuse me of theft if they wanted to. The six-figure sum from Npower popped up unexpectedly in amateur actor Terry Atkinson's bank account - not least as he isn't even one of their customers . 'But I have to count every penny to pay my bills, so to have that sort of life-changing amount sitting taunting me in my account is pretty hard to deal with.' Mr Atkinson earns less than £20,000-a-year in a call centre and lives in a shared house in Abingdon, Oxfordshire with two friends, paying £525-a-month in rent. His passion is acting - he recently played Algernon in Abingdon Drama Club's production of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest - and it's money that could have helped him fulfil his dream.'I'd love to go to drama school, which these days would cost around £60,000,' he said. 'In a parallel universe where I do just go and spend the money, I could pay for that and get my own flat as well.' He hasn't been a customer with Npower since he was a student in 2008. His current home has a pre-pay meter which Mr Atkinson said was swallowing up more and more of the friends' income. 'We have to be careful to make sure we can pay the bills,' he said. His bank has told him that Npower will have to request the money transfer is rescinded before it can be taken out of his account. For now, he has transferred it into his savings account to avoid confusion - and he may be able to pocket any interest it earns. Npower last month put fuel prices up by 10.4 per cent, more than rivals British Gas and SSE, taking an average annual bill for gas and electricity to £1,459. It recently revealed profits so far this year of £116million, however that was down on last year and led to warnings of 2,000 job losses. But chief executive Paul Massara branded calls for him to give up his annual bonus of around £150,000 a 'gimmick', saying he would only receive it for meeting customer satisfaction targets. Anyone who receives a windfall which they suspect was deposited accidentally and fails to inform their bank is likely to be committing the offence of retaining wrongful credit under the 1968 Theft Act. In 2008 Amanda Moorcroft, of Blackburn, was jailed for ten months after spending £135,000 wrongly paid into her sister's Abbey National account on a holiday to Florida, luxury furniture and gifts to relations. An Npower spokesman said: 'We're currently investigating this internally as a matter of urgency.'","Money appeared in amateur actor Terry Atkinson's bank account .

Each closeup has a detail that in some way caught his eye, from scars and bandages to crooked teeth and bizarre haircuts. ‘I’m looking for the photos that move me for whatever reason’ he told the New York Daily News in 2012. ‘From things that are terribly funny to things that are terribly tragic.’ Last month the Swann Galleries in New York auctioned a massive collection of nearly 1500 mugshots belonging to Michaelson from over 100 years ago. The various vintage photographs showed American men and women whose crimes include larceny to homicide to ‘incendiary’ labor organizers. They also include 'running numbers', an illegal practice of the 1920s and 1930s in which a 'number runner' would ferry cash for organised gangs controlling a lottery-type betting game. They collected the bets from the gamblers and delivered the payoff when the gamblers won. Winning numbers were often determined by the last digits of the payoff results of horse races. Producer Dennis Mohr first got the idea for a film about mugshots when he saw a copy of The Slammer, a weekly Southern tabloid that publishes pages upon pages of mugshots, in a supermarket .

A Chicago-born man, who went missing three decades ago as a toddler after his father took him to Mexico, has been reunited with his U.S. mother in California after a harrowing trek back to the United States. David Amaya Barrick, now 37, was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents last month but freed after convincing authorities of his U.S. citizenship - only to vanish again for several days before turning up at a San Diego church. The mother and son finally met each other this weekend for the first time since the son went missing in 1979, to find they have the same eyes and nose, share the same laugh, and both love plaid shirts - even if they no longer have a language in common. Reunited: Kathy Amaya (left) was separated from her son David Amaya Barrick (right) when his father kidnapped him to Mexico when he was just a toddler. The two met for the first time in three decades today . 'We have some catching up to do,' Kathy Amaya, 60, told Reuters on Sunday through tears a day after the pair finally met face to face at the San Diego International Airport after she flew in from Wisconsin. 'We're going to do that.' The Border Patrol said Barrick was taken from Chicago by his father in 1979 and brought to Mexico, where he was left with his paternal grandparents, speaking only Spanish. He later trained as a percussionist and moved to Monterrey, where he built a career playing in Norteno bands. He married and had two children, but the marriage didn't work out. Earlier this month, he illegally crossed into California from Mexico with undocumented immigrants and was arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol about a mile east of the Pacific Ocean. At first, he said he was Mexican, then remembered that his grandparents told him he was born in a Chicago hospital. Thankful: Mother and son met for the first time at a church in San Diego today. They plan to spend Thanksgiving together with David's half-brothers and half-sisters in Wisconsin . Language barrier: After spending most of his life in Mexico, David only speaks Spanish and is unable to communicate fully with his English-speaking mom. Pictured above with Pastor Freddy Rivas (center) He also told the border agents he had been beaten and robbed of his money, cell phone and Mexican identification before entering the United States. The agents checked out his story and were able to locate his birth certificate and his mother - putting the two in touch over the phone in an emotional long-distance call. Because Barrick speaks only Spanish, agents acted as translators. 'It was very emotional,' supervisory agent Troy Matthews said. 'He told her he grew up being told she abandoned him and she started crying that she was afraid they told him that and how she never stopped wanting to find him.' Coming to America: David and his mother were finally put in contact with each other when he was caught illegally crossing into the country from Mexico. Pictured above with translator Behriz Castro . Citizenship: After locating David's birth certificate which confirmed he was born in Chicago, and therefore a U.S. citizen, border patrol helped him find his mom. Pictured above with translator Juan Soto (left) On Tuesday, Amaya will fly to Wisconsin with her firstborn son, where he'll meet her four other grown children, three brothers and a sister. 'We'll spend Thanksgiving with so much to give thanks for,' Amaya said. 'It's really overwhelming, sometimes it feels like my heart will burst.' Both mother and son acknowledge they have much to do to rebuild their relationship, starting with finding a common language. But Amaya pointed at Barrick's plaid shirt, and then her own, and they both laughed the same laugh. 'We are the same blood,' Amaya said. 'We can figure out the rest.' Father: David holds a child from the church's daycare. He has two children of his own in Mexico, but is no longer married to their mother .","David Amaya Barrick, now 37, was born in Chicago, but taken to Mexico as a toddler by his father .

Thorson, seen here in a March 2013 mugshot, was recently sent back to jail after an 'alleged probation violation and for failing to appear in court' Jilted lover Scott Thorson has revealed shocking details of his relationship with Liberace -- and is now back in jail 'for an alleged probation violation and failing to appear in court', TMZ reports. Prior to his arrest on Wednesday, Thorson described in an interview for 'Oprah: Where Are they Now?,'  the lavish lifestyle he enjoyed as Liberace's lover. 'Although we had our differences, we had more good times than bad times. Well, I mean it was a wonderful life. I was 16 years old, I was walking around with all these jewels -- you know, a million dollars worth of jewelry, 30 cars. I had more mink coats and diamonds than Elizabeth Taylor had,' he said. In the video, Thorson also described how he received plastic surgery to resemble a young Liberace at his lover's request. 'It was amazing, the resemblance afterwards -- the same chin, it was just amazing,' he said. Thorson also alleged in the interview that Liberace introduced him to using drugs. 'When it got out of control, he just decided that he was going to discard me like a piece of trash. Cut off my credit cards, cut off all the cash,' he told the special. Thorson later sued Liberace for palimony, the video adds, and is believed to have received $95,000 in a settlement. Thorson, left, seen here with former lover Liberace, right, in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1982, said 'I had more mink coats and diamonds than Elizabeth Taylor had' Thorson, seen here in this file photo with Liberace, underwent plastic surgery to look like a younger version of his lover . 'The reason why I sued Liberace was because he threw me on the streets and I had nothing. He called me a disgruntled employee. That I was a street hustler, that I was liar. That there was never a sexual relationship. That I was nothing but a gold digger. And I was just a young kid.' Thorson was booked on Wednesday, TMZ reports. He had been on probation for a burglary and ID conviction from earlier this year. He also faced a drug violation in September but received a rehab sentence, the website adds. Thorson, the Associated Press reports, was forced to reside in Washoe County as a result of a determination by probation officials. His lawyer, David Houston, told the Associated Press in September 'He was living in what I would refer to as a drug-infested area. If you put enough stress on an individual and make things seem helpless you do get a certain result - in this case a relapse.' Prior to his September arrest, Thorson had spent time at the famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch Brothel, under the supervision of owner Dennis Hof. 'Scott is the dysfunctional son that I never wanted but I am willing to still help him out. He has an addiction problem and needs constant supervision to beat his problem,' Hof told The National Enquirer. 'I partially blame the courts for his ongoing problem -- they refused to allow him to stay with me at the Bunny Ranch which is a clean, drug-free sober environment.' Hof also told The National Enquirer that 'as soon as they put him back out [in] Reno he was surrounded by temptations that will always get the best of him.'

Vincent Barrick saved friend Juan Argumedo, also six-years-old, from certain doom by grabbing on the collar of the vicious mutt until their screaming caused startled adults to run and help. The two boys came in contact with the dog while cutting through a neighbor’s yard as they had often done in the past, family members told KUTV. Innocent victim: Juan Argumedo was viciously attacked by the pit bull, but saved by friend Vincent Barrick . ‘We heard some screaming, blood-curdling screams,’ proud grandfather Kevin Barrick said. He ran through his St. George backyard towards the commotion and saw his tiny grandson pulling back the huge dog while another young boy was trapped underneath. ‘I could see Vincent standing there holding up on the dog's collar, pulling, almost standing on his tippy toes, pulling as hard as he could,’ said the family patriarch. Kevin Barrick did not realize the extent of the Mr Argumendo’s injuries until he too tried to pull the cruel canine off him young boy. He's a hero!: Mr Barrick pulled the malicious mongrel off his friend as best he could until adults arrived . Bad dog!: This is the pit bull that attacked an innocent young boy . ‘Juan was being pulled up with him,’ said the grandfather. ‘He still had a hold of Juan's face.’ Kevin Barrick punched the dog in the face, causing it to run away, but the real horror didn’t set in until paramedics arrived – the dog had torn the flesh off the innocent boy’s leg all the way to the bone. ‘When they cut his shorts off from him and revealed his leg his mom about passed out and the paramedics said 'oh, good Lord,’ Kevin Barrick told the station. The innocent child also suffered puncture wounds to his chest, face and head as well. The victim’s father is upset his son spent hours in surgery, and will require several more procedures, but is also grateful that young Vincent Barrick didn’t back down from the malicious mutt. Where it all went down: This is the backyard Vincent Barrick ran through to help his grandson pull the blood-thirsty bully off Mr Argumendo . ‘We got lucky that Vincent made that decision,’ the father told the station. The blood-thirsty pit bull is under a mandatory 10-day quarantine, KUTV reported. It is not clear what it’s ultimate fate will be. Both adults agree the attack could have been deadly had the brave young boy not acted. ‘My grandson said that the dog kept trying to drag Juan underneath the motor home,’ Kevin Barrick explained. ‘If he could have got Juan there he would have shook him back and forth like a rag doll and shredded him.’ Luckily for everyone, Vincent Barrick is a hero.","Vincent Barrick saved friend Juan Argumedo, also six-years-old, from a vicious pit bull attack .

"By . Lucy Crossley . PUBLISHED: . 10:50 EST, 25 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:03 EST, 25 November 2013 . A teenager who killed another pupil by repeatedly punching him in the head was secretly placed in a new school before he could be sentenced. The boy was just 14 when he killed 14-year-old classmate Euan Craig, after a row in their school gym. However, following the fatal attack the teenager was moved to a new school in Glasgow - where pupils and even most of his teachers were unaware he was due to be sentenced for culpable homicide. Victim: Euan Craig, 14, was repeatedly punched in the head in a row in his school gym. After the fatal attack the killer was secretly moved to a new school . He spent three weeks at the new secondary school after admitting the killing in May 2012. As a pupil at his previous school, in another area of the Scottish city, the killer had erupted into a rage when fellow pupil Euan . accidentally hit him with a sponge ball in the school gym. Euan, . who had been aiming at one of his friends as he waited for his teacher . to arrive only to catch the killer on the side of his face, immediately . apologised. However, the other boy walked up to him and hit him approximately five times on the side of . the head, as Euan tried to back away and shield himself from the blows. Throughout the attack Euan continued to say sorry for throwing the ball. Euan then went to sit on a bench with other pupils, but slumped from his seat suffering a seizure. A teacher rushed to help him, but he did not respond. Euan was taken to hospital, where doctors discovered massive bleeding in his . brain, and he died the following afternoon after suffering from the . freak head injury. A pathologist concluded that Euan’s fatal brain haemorrhage was caused by him being struck on the left side of his face. After . a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh, the killer was sent to a young . offenders institution by judge Lord Bracadale, who told the teen he had . no option but to impose a custodial sentence. He had told the teenager: 'I . have come to the view that the sustained nature of the assault, the . circumstances in which it was committed and the devastating consequences . which flowed from it combine to indicate that, despite you age, the . only appropriate disposal is a custodial one.' The court had been told that according to the boy's school report from his first school, he was a quiet boy whose behaviour was generally good. Glasgow City Council were obliged by law to continue providing him with education, even after he admitted to the killing. Rather than being tutored at home, the . schoolboy started at his new school in September last year, just months . after Euan's death. He admitted culpable homicide on October . 25 last year, but remained at the school, which has more than 1,000 pupils, . until November 16 - one week before he was sentenced three-and-a-half . years in detention. Only a few select staff members who had direct contact with the teenager were told of the boy's background. '(The teenager's) arrival at the school was conducted in complete secrecy,' a source close to the school told the Daily Record. Sentenced: At a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh Judge Lord Bracadale said he had no choice but to impose a custodial sentence . 'There . should never have been any question about schooling him at home but . instead, education officials put him back in the classroom.' The . source said that most parents were not informed of the boy's presence at . the school, although the chairman of the Parent Teacher Association was . told. His identity remains hidden because of his age when the crime was committed. Euan's parents, Richard and Ann, and legal experts have questioned whether it was appropriate to place him in a busy secondary school, instead of him having lessons at home. Mr Craig, 45, raised fears that a pupil at the new school may have recognised the boy and confronted him. His wife, 44, said the family still had unanswered questions relating to the attack, including why Euan's class had been left unsupervised. Scottish Shadow Justice Minister Graeme Pearson also said that given the nature of his crime, there should have been more consideration into whether the killer could have been home schooled. He said: 'We really need to challenge whether the right decision was taken to send [him] to another school after he pleaded guilty to such a terrible crime, particularly as other pupils and parents were oblivious to what dangers they might have faced.' A spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council said: 'A multi-agency full risk assessment was carried out prior to the move and the parent council fully involved in the decision. 'As a council we have a duty of care to educate every child.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Teenager repeatedly punched Euan Craig, 14, in the head .

"By . James Chapman and James Coney . PUBLISHED: . 03:51 EST, 25 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:15 EST, 25 November 2013 . George Osborne was accused of performing a hasty U-turn last night after agreeing to cap sky-high rates charged by Wonga and other payday lenders. The Chancellor rushed out plans for a ceiling on the cost of payday loans, which are expected to limit the maximum price of a loan to as little as 10 per cent of its value. But senior Liberal Democrats accused him of having resisted a tougher crackdown for months, and claimed he decided to act only after realising he faced a likely defeat on the issue in Parliament. Crackdown: Chancellor George Osborne said he wanted to end the 'legal extortion' of high interest rates imposed by payday lenders . Mr Osborne insisted there was growing . evidence in support of the move, including the positive effects of a cap . brought into force in Australia. ‘We’ve always believed in properly . regulated free markets where there is competition but consumers are . protected,’ he said. He . denied charges of a U-turn, pointing out that Labour had done . ‘absolutely nothing’ to tackle payday lenders during their 13 years in . office. Rising Labour star . Stella Creasy has led a long campaign for a legal limit on the amounts . charged by payday lenders, which critics say can ramp up to as high as . 5,853 per cent a year if supposedly short-term loans are allowed to roll . on. Pressure on the . Government to intervene grew earlier this year when the Archbishop of . Canterbury Justin Welby issued a fierce denunciation of the burgeoning . industry. Lib Dem leader . Nick Clegg, Business Secretary Vince Cable and consumer minister Jo . Swinson have been urging the Treasury to take a stronger stance ‘for . quite a long while’, according to a senior Lib Dem source. Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has led the successful campaign for a cap on sky-high charges by payday lenders, has carved out a higher profile for herself than most of the members of Ed Miliband’s shadow Cabinet. To the irritation of some of her longer-serving colleagues, the 36-year-old Walthamstow MP, who entered Parliament in 2010, is increasingly tipped as a potential future party leader. Some senior Labour MPs refer to her sarcastically as ‘Saint Stella’, while others in the shadow Cabinet mutter that she is not enough of a ‘team player’ ever to succeed as party leader. As well as confronting payday lenders with a relentless zeal, Miss Creasy, who has a PhD, has also campaigned on the issue of Twitter abuse directed at women – reporting ‘trolls’ to the police. One male Twitter user who called her a ‘dumb, blonde bitch’ received the response: ‘That’s dumb Dr blonde bitch to you, actually.’ Miss Creasy’s youthful appearance is once said to have prompted Tory minister Andrew Robathan to wonder what she was doing in a lift reserved for MPs, apparently because he assumed she was someone’s personal assistant. A keen indie music fan, Miss Creasy once told applicants for a job as her Parliamentary assistant that ‘knowledge of mid and late 90s indie music is beneficial’. ‘It . has previously been blocked by the Conservatives, specifically the . Treasury,’ the source said. ‘It has never been total opposition but . there has been a real reluctance to look at mandating a cap.’ But . Tory sources said claims of resistance from Mr Osborne were ‘totally . untrue’ and that Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith had been . making the ‘moral case’ for intervention for months. The . Lib Dem source claimed the Chancellor had caved in after being warned . that the Government risked defeat in a vote due to be called in the . Lords to amend the law to cap the cost of payday loans. Lib . Dem peer Lord Sharkey proposed a maximum loan of £300, a cap on charges . of a maximum of 10 per cent of the loan value and a bar on people from . having two or more loans at the same time. The . Government has already given the new Financial Conduct Authority the . power to cap fees and rates on payday loans, but the Treasury is now to . go further by placing an obligation on the regulator to use those . powers. Labour leader Ed Miliband used a speech earlier this month to accuse payday of targetting vulnerable people who are threatened and bullied when they get into financial trouble . The rules are to be included in the Banking Reform Bill, which is proceeding through Parliament. ‘The regulator will go away and decide what is the best form of cap,’ the Chancellor said. Lord . Sharkey said he was ‘delighted’ by the move. ‘For far too long . unscrupulous payday loan companies have been allowed to prey on some of . the most vulnerable people in our society with impunity,’ he added. ‘Far . from leading to a reduction in access to credit, as the payday lenders . are claiming this morning, evidence has shown that the volume of money . lent to people actually increased after a regulatory system was put in . place. ‘People need . protection from the worst excesses of the payday loan companies, and I . am glad that the Treasury has seen the light.’ by James Coney . WONGA . Typical APR 5853% . Signed a four-year deal to sponsor Newcastle United. This . month hired a Bafta-nominated director to produce a film on the . controversial company to counteract criticism about its huge profits and . sky-high interest rates. CASH LADY . Typical APR 2670% . Courted controversy when it hired ex-bankrupt reality star Kerry Katona to front ad campaign. But this summer the Atomic Kitten star declared herself bankrupt for the second time in five years due to unpaid debts. Her money troubles led to her being dropped as the face of Cash Lady. PAYDAY UK . Typical APR 2610% . Bought by US giant Dollar Financial in 2011 for a reported $195million. It is now part of the same firm which owns The Money Shop, which has 550 stores nationwide. QUICK QUID . Typical APR 1734% . Spent an estimated £3.2 million, advertising during programmes like Friends, Desperate Scousewives and Hollyoaks. In July it apologised after sending emails threatening to send in debt collectors to people who had not borrowed money. Allowing people to borrow a small amount of money for a short period of time is a legitimate and useful business. But those who turn to payday loan firms are sometimes desperate and often disadvantaged. What they need is protection. What they have is the Wild West, with companies behaving as they please and charging what they like. Charities are being swamped by calls from households who thought they would have to repay only a small amount after a few days, but have ended up with crippling debts. Now, the Government is planning to cap the cost of payday loans. Currently all companies that offer payday loans are supposed to state their annual percentage rate (APR). For example, Wonga’s APR is 5,835 per cent. This is for someone who borrowed £150 for 18 days. They’d repay a total of £183.49 including interest and charges. Details of the Government’s plan have not been revealed. Australia already has a cap. There the maximum a lender can charge is a set-up fee equivalent to 20 per cent of the loan, plus 4 per cent a month. This provides for maximum charges of $72 (£40) for a $300 (£170) borrowing over one month. But this is still an APR of 1,221 per cent. Though high, it’s far cheaper than most in the UK. A similar rule here will do little, however, to stop the perilous rolling over of debt and charges from one month to the next. And capping APRs for payday lenders will do nothing to curb the high cost of short-term borrowing from banks. An investigation by the Mail earlier this year found that the equivalent APR for an overdraft with some of Britain’s biggest banks was as high as 53million per cent when borrowing £200 for ten days. Yet, banks are not forced to use APR for the cost of an overdraft. One solution may be to scrap the APR altogether – it is a complicated calculation not widely understood. That would mean finding an alternative method of comparing total costs for loans taken over different lengths of time. An APR at least allows an indication of how expensive one type of loan is compared to another. Perhaps the best solution, and that championed by Lib Dem peer Lord Sharkey, would be to cap the total size of a payday loan at £300 and cap charges at 10 per cent of the amount borrowed. It’s a calculation that most borrowers could easily understand. Add in other charges and ban the fees on debts that are rolled over, and the total amount to repay would be £333. That’s three times cheaper than a similar loan at present in the UK. In Florida, an identical set of rules has been in place for more than a decade and payday firms there still make a very healthy profit indeed. Whatever the Government’s rules, the effect must be to slash the cost of short-term borrowing, because every penny that doesn’t make it into the pockets of payday lenders is cash that helps the desperate and indebted.","Cap will cover interest rates, fees, penalties and rollover charges .

A snake handling preacher has vowed to continue worshipping with deadly rattlesnakes despite the threat of jail - and being bitten four times. Andrew Hamblin, 22, is a pastor at the Tabernacle Church of God in the Appalachian mountains outside La Follette, Tennessee. The church is part of century-old Pentecostal tradition in the . region that takes literally an instruction in the Gospel of Mark that 'they shall take up serpents.' Risky business: Father-of-five Andre Hamblin has been badly bitten by snakes four times, one occasion has even left him permanently disfigured . Devoted: The defiant preacher faces up to a year in prison after being charged with illegally possessing 53 venomous snakes seized from his church by Tennessee wildlife agency officers earlier this month . But the defiant preacher faces up to a year in prison after being charged with illegally possessing 53 venomous . snakes seized from his church by Tennessee wildlife agency officers . earlier this month. Under the laws of the state anyone owning venomous snakes, even zoos and circuses, must apply for permits and comply with specific requirements to guarantee public safety. His devotion has left him crippled as he is unable to make a fist following a snakebite on the knuckle which almost killed him in 2010. 'I was at death's door,' he said. 'Me and death were just about ready to smoke a cigarette together.' He believes his recovery is a direct result of God's will and cites another serious bite - this time to the neck - sustained soon after as proof that he is protected from harm by his faith. The incident left his shirt soaked in . blood but he says he escaped serious injury adding: 'I never swelled, I never itched, I . never suffered nothing but bleeding.' Raucous: Congregation members speak in tongues, weep and bang tambourines in services which can last up to 5 hours . And despite the physical threat and appearing in court Mr Hamblin has continued worship with the huge rattlesnakes thrust above his head after his followers helped smuggle in new creatures after the previous batch were confiscated. They claim that they are victims of a state crackdown after another preach Jamie Coots had two copperheads confiscated after being stopped while driving home through Tennessee earlier this year. During the raucous services, worshippers dance, bang tambourines, speak in tongues and handle the 3ft long animals believing that they are protected from danger by God. Speaking to the Telegraph he . said: 'I'm willing to fight this, because here in the United States . we're supposed to be guaranteed our religious freedom under the first . amendment of the constitution. 'We're . Christians who believe in being saved by the blood of Jesus Christ just . like any other – it's not like we're part of some different religion. I . do feel it is an attack upon our religious freedom.' Mr . Hamblin said he was called on by God to handle the creatures, and that . their appearances were shows of divine power. He has also likened the . practice to 'Catholics using wine.' Prominent: Unlike many other snake-handling pastors who preach in homes and behind closed doors, Hamblin preaches at the Tabernacle Church of God in LaFollette, Tennessee, and is determined to bring his practices to the masses . However these claims have been . dismissed by authorities who maintain that the practices constiture a . serious 'public safety hazard.' Matthew . Cameron, a wildlife agency spokesman said: 'We treat him just as we . would anyone else found to be storing venomous snakes in their home. The presence of children at the services, including Mr Hamblin's own five, only adds to safety concerns but Mr Hamblin maintains that only over 18s ever handle the reptiles. He added: 'I can understand not wanting to endanger another's life. That's perfectly understandable. But in 100 years, there have been only 10 deaths in Tennessee from serpents.' Despite this a number of pastors in recent years have met their demise because of their unorthodox methods of worship. Mack Wolford of West Virginia, who led one of the best-attended snake-handling churches out of an estimated 125 in the region, was killed by a timber rattlesnake in May last year. His own father, also a snake-handling preacher also died from a rattlesnake bit in the 1980s. But while dozens of his fellow pastors hold their services in secret and close their doors to outsiders, Mr Hamblin is determined to bring his sect into the mainstream and hopes to found America's first snake-handling mega-church.

England cricketer Jonathan Trott has pulled out of the Ashes tour and flown home blaming a stress-related illness after his team's dramatic loss to the Australian hosts. The 32-year-old father of one will now take an indefinite break from the sport as he concentrates on recovering from the condition that his coach said he'd been battling 'for quite a while'. Trott's decision to leave the Ashes and fly home came shortly after Australian batsman David Warner told a press conference the Englishman's performance had been 'poor and weak'. The news of the England No. 3's decision to pull out came after England went down in flames in the first Test at the Gabba stadium in Brisbane. England cricketer Jonathan Trott, right, is flying home from the Ashes with a stress-related condition: England captain Alastair Cook, left, said Australian comments about Trott's 'poor and weak' performance were 'disrespectful' Trott said in a statement: ‘I don’t feel . that it is right that I’m playing knowing that I’m not 100 per cent and I . cannot currently operate at the level I have done in the past. ‘My priority now is to take a break . from cricket so that I can focus on my recovery. I want to wish my . team-mates all the very best for the remainder of the tour.’ As he flew home the English team's managing director Hugh Morris and head coach Andy Flower told the media Trott's decision to pull out was taken jointly with the team management. And they said no date had been set for Trott's return to international cricket. Morris . said: ‘Jonathan Trott is an incredibly talented cricketer who has . proven himself time and again for England. 'The cricket side of things is . unimportant now. All that matters is that Jonathan is given the time, . support and space he needs to recover. Rivals: Australia's David Warner shakes hands with Trott after the hosts won the first Test by a margin of 381 runs.

'We have systems in place and personnel in place to support our squad members that might have struggled in different areas and those systems and individuals have always dealt with these situations successfully. 'We had high hopes Trotty would have a great tour. It hasn't worked out that way. Hopefully he will come back stronger in the future.' Jonathan Trott was staying at the Sofitel hotel in Brisbane with his team-mates before he flew home . Trott looks dejected after being dismissed by Mitchell Johnson during England's first innings for just 10 . 'Brave man': Former England captain Freddie Flintoff tweeted his support for Jonathan Trott today . Trott's exit from Australia came 48 hours after he was criticised by Australian batsman David Warner. Speaking after a poor performance by . England on day three of the current series Warner, 27, said: 'England . are on the back foot - it does look like they've got scared eyes at the . moment. 'The way that Trotty got out today was pretty poor and weak' - Australian batsman David Warner . 'The way that Trotty got out today was pretty poor and weak.' He added: 'Obviously there's a weakness there and we're on top of it at the moment.' When asked if Warner's comments had had a direct influence on Trott's exit, Flower said: 'That would be inaccurate. 'As . I said earlier, Jonathan has been struggling with this condition for . quite a while and has managed it very successfully but we've been on . tour for about a month. 'He's had his ups and downs through that month and it is not directly related to that. 'I think players commenting about fellow professionals in the media is disrespectful' - England coach Andy Flower . 'I would also say that I think players commenting about fellow professionals in the media is disrespectful. 'I think on this occasion he has got that horribly wrong. 'I . think we set different standards to that and one of the reasons we . don't like commenting about opposition players is because we don't know . what is going on their dressing room, we don't know what is going on in . their private lives.' And England captain Alastair Cook said: 'I think the comment by David Warner was pretty disrespectful to any professional cricketer really.' Reaction: Former England international footballer Gary Neville wished Trott all the best on Twitter . Sympathy: Former England opener Marcus Trescothick was also quick to react . Get well soon: Trott's England teammate in the shorter forms of the game, Luke Wright, also took to the social networking site to pass on his best wishes . Good health: Former England player Paul Collingwood also joined the chorus of good luck messages . Trott’s . England team-mates were aware of his condition, which he has been . managing successfully for some time, but it is understood neither . Cricket Australia nor the Australian players knew. But while the England dressing-room viewed Warner’s comments as disrespectful, there was no suggestion at all that . Warner’s remarks contributed to his decision to leave the tour. Former England batsman Nasser Hussain, speaking on Sky Sports, said: 'You just don't know what is going on in someone's mind and its obviously a highly stressful situation and it just tipped him over the edge. 'He was the glue that held England's batting line together. 'This will come as a real shock to the team and everyone involved around the team. I think England were right to bring him - playing Test match cricket is tough, you have to give them the chance to play. Soak it up: Trott gestures to the crowd during the first day at the Gabba . Sports stars immediately took to Twitter to pass on their best wishes to Trott. The former England opener Marcus Trescothick, who abruptly returned home from a tour of India in 2006 and the 2006-2007 tour of Australia and later retired because of depression, wrote: 'Sad news, hope trotty is ok.' Luke Wright, an England teammate of Trott in the shorter forms of the game, said: 'Hope Trotty is ok. The Ashes are important but there are bigger things in life than just cricket. Hope he is back well soon.' Former England international footballer Gary Neville added: 'Hope Trott is OK and back soon. Test cricket is tough and we are going to see a major Ashes battle in the next few months.' Former England opener Marcus Trescothick, now 37, can sympathise with Jonathan Trott because he went through something similar seven years ago. His problems first surfaced in 2006 when he flew home from Baroda in India after breaking down in the dressing room. Later that year he was selected for the 2006-2007 Ashes tour but after two weeks in Australia he flew home in November 2006 citing 'a recurrence of a . stress-related illness'. Cricketers Marcus Trescothick, left, and Michael Yardy, right have both struggled with depression and anxiety . In 2008 Trescothick tried to travel with colleagues on a pre-season tour of Dubai but got only as far as Heathrow, where he was found sobbing in the Duty Free area. In September of that year the likeable cricketer published his autobiography, Coming Back To Me, in which he talked about his depression and revealed he'd suffered from panic attacks from the age of 10. He never played for England again, but instead concentrated on playing domestic cricket, which he said meant he was never more than three hours away from his family. Two years ago cricketer Michael Yardy flew home to his family from the 2011 Cricket World Cup suffering from depression. The then-30-year-old left his hotel in India where the players had been cooped up because of security fears to go back to his wife and two small children in England. The former Sussex captain said afterwards: 'It got to the stage where I couldn't cope any more.  I was out of my comfort zone. 'I wasn't getting out because security was so tight and I'd lie awake until 3am.'","The 32-year-old flew home from Australia where hosts defeated England .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 05:55 EST, 25 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:03 EST, 25 November 2013 . Seats should be ripped out on the most overcrowded train services to create cheaper ‘standing only’ carriages, ministers have been urged. The railways should follow the model of budget airlines like Ryanair and easyjet who offer cheap, no-frills travel in contrast to the high-end services run by the likes of British Airways or even private jets. Passengers in the new economy class carriages would pay up to 20 per cent less than those sitting in standard class, under plans drawn up by the Institute for Economic Affairs. Future: Boris Johnson stands on a London Overground train, which could be used as the model for seatless economy class services . It is claimed that a return to third-class travel for the first time since 1956 would be a cheaper way to ease crowding than spending billions on new lines and stations. Transport expert David Starkie, who wrote the report for the IEA, argues rail commuters should be given more choice about the quality of service and the price they pay. ‘An additional high-density “economy class” section could be introduced on commuter trains, access to which would be priced during the peak at a large discount to current fares. ‘From the resource cost point of view, there would be more passengers on a standard-length train without the recourse to high levels of taxpayer-funded investment in expensive new infrastructure.’ Third . class travel first became an option in 1838. Six years later an act of . parliament forced train companies to provide a roof in third class. The . 1844 Railway Act stipulated that all third-class passengers should be . carried in covered accommodation. Railway companies also began providing . lighting in third-class carriages. However, whereas there were several . oil lamps in the first class carriages, third-class carriages only had . one. In 1844 the railways introduced Parly & Gov class for government workers. The Pullman car, introduced in Britain in 1874, created a new level of comfort. Midland . Railway abolished second class travel in 1875, upgrading third class . passengers to second class standards. Other railways followed the . example. Second class disappeared from fare tables until . 1956, when third class was renamed second. British Rail later renamed . this standard class. Passengers already crowd at the front of trains arriving at the final destination, even if there are empty seats at the rear, because they want to beat the crush at ticket barriers. The report proposes introducing an ‘additional high-density section to commuter trains’ of three carriages which would be 20 per cent cheaper than the standard peak price. ‘A discount of this amount would place the price of “economy class” about mid-way between the standard class rail fare and the fare for commuter coaches,’ the report said. The discount could be less for shorter journeys and more for longer commutes. The carriages could be modelled on London Overground trains service, with flip-down seats running down the edge but with most room giving over to standing space. It would mean trains could carry more people without investing in additional rolling stock or lengthening platforms. It could even be cheaper to run the new trains. ‘Stripped of seat furniture train carriages would be lighter,’ the report said. It would also be ‘substantially’ quicker for passengers to board and get off the train, with the potential to improve service reliability. It is claimed all passengers would enjoy the benefits of the new third class service. Those choosing the economy class would save money, while those opting for a seat would ‘enjoy higher service quality not having to share their space with standing passengers’. It could mark the return of the drinks trolley to standard class carriages if overcrowding in the aisles was reduced. The report suggests the discounted ticket should not cost train companies money, because more passengers would be able to board each service. Crush: The Institute for Economic Affairs argues that too many people are already forced to stand in carriages where seats take up too much space . Last month the Department for Transport insisted it was not planning to reintroduce  third-class travel after leaked plans to re-privatise the East Coast main line from London to Aberdeen included proposals for three different classes of travel. Ministers have suggested it could be an additional class of travel between the existing first and standard classes – broadly equivalent to a 'premium economy' class on airlines. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin also proposed stripping out first class carriages from busy routes to make more room for standard ticket holders.","Trains could replicate Ryanair and easjet in offering no-frills travel .

Impatient customers lodged complaints against Mandy Gorey who closed the local branch of the post office for 48 hours after being held up at gun point . A village postmistress who closed the local post office for two days after being held up in an armed raid was investigated by bosses after customers complained they couldn't pick up parcels. Mandy Gorey, 49, had a gun pointed at her during the raid which took place in Greenfield in Oldham, Greater Manchester. The mother-of-two who has run the office for 13 years was left so traumatised by the incident she closed its doors for 48 hours. But impatient local customers lodged formal complaints with the Post Office because they weren't able to collect parcels during the two days. The claims were investigated but have since been dismissed. Mrs Gorey was shocked to discover villagers had reported the office's closure as most local residents  sent her flowers and messages of support following the incident November 5. After reopening, she placed a notice in the office's window which read: 'Thanks you to all friends and customers for your patience and kind wishes during our terrible ordeal. 'If the two people who made a complaint to customer services about not being able to collect their parcels whilst we were closed would like to make yourselves known we will explain the severity of the ordeal personally.' The 49-year-old claims the people who lodged complaints would have known why the branch was closed as in such a small village, 'everyone knows what has happened'. 'After the initial anger I just felt sorry for them because they obviously have nothing better to do. But there is no chance they will apologise now out of embarrassment,' she said. Robbers carrying an axe and a gun attempted to rob the Post Office earlier this month while Ms Gorey was working . 'If my customers find out who it is I’m sure they’ll let them know about it. 'If there were stocks in the village they would put them on that. 'But I think the people that have complained have probably suffered enough because everyone has been talking about it. It’s like Chinese whispers in a village like this.' Mrs Gorey had a gun pointed in her face when the robbers arrived at the post office by motorbike at around four o'clock. 'It was quiet in the office at the time, then two men barged through the door demanding cash.' 'One was holding a hand gun and one an axe. 'One held out the gun at my colleague and I. The other man, with the axe, was blocking the door to prevent entry. In effect we felt like hostages.' 'The ordeal was terrifying - it lasted about three minutes but, in truth, it it felt like ten minutes. It was if it was happening in slow motion.' A 'guardian angel' customer who tried to enter the branch at the time of the attempted robbery notified police who rushed to the scene in Greenfield, Oldham . Mrs Gorey recalls how the men fled when a customer realised what was happening and phoned police. The 'guardian angel' tried to enter the post office but was blocked entry. After spotting the motorbike, she looked through the window to see the men yielding an axe and phoned for help. Speaking of the two people who lodged complains, one local resident said: 'I think maybe they didn’t realise what had happened. 'If they did then it’s really sad. It’s an awful thing to do to Mandy because she’s brilliant. After learning that two customers lodged complaints against her for closing the branch, the postmistress invited them to get in touch . “She litterpicks around here and does lots for the community. She even paints phone boxes and that’s in her spare time because this post office is used constantly. 'These ridiculous complaints are all we need because after all that’s happened because the robbery was really worrying for the people who live around here.' Parish councillor Neil Allsopp said: 'The post office is the centre of the community and we are more interested in the real victims, Mandy and her team, not someone who has not been able to collect a parcel. 'Mandy is an integral part of the village and a marvellous asset. We are all pleased she is operating her business again, something for which we should be grateful. 'One of the finest traits of the Saddleworth people is the depth of their compassion and their selfless support for each other through difficult times. 'I know Mandy will have seen this herself over recent weeks. I want her to know and remember, the people of Greenfield support her 100 per cent.' A Post Office spokesman said: 'Any robbery is traumatic for victims and we will be supporting police in their efforts to apprehend those responsible. The Post Office would urge anyone with information to contact police.","Mandy Gorey was held up by robbers yielding an axe and a gun .

Black labrador Bob has been saved from bankruptcy after his trust fund was running low because he required medical treatment . A labrador left to a care home by his elderly owner has been saved from bankruptcy after £5,000 was raised to top up his trust fund. War veteran Harold Pursey left all of his remaining money to pay for his black labrador Bob's on-going care when he died of heart failure in 2010. His care home in Somerset agreed to adopt the dog when Mr Pursey died and the former butcher's £666 was put into the fund. But 13-year-old Bob has recently required medical treatment for his stiff joints and racked up big medical bills on acupuncture, hydrotherapy and canine massage. The funds were running low so staff at Burnham Lodge and nearby residents started to raise money with fundraising events. The latest event, a fishing competition, raised a staggering £2,000, bringing the total raised to £5,000 and ensuring Bob can continue to live in the lap of luxury. Judith Alder, who now looks after Bob at the home in Burnham-on-Sea, said: 'We are chuffed to bits, it was absolutely fantastic, we had no idea we would raise that much. 'There was such a huge response to Bob, everybody adores him, we are almost speechless at how much we managed to raise. 'Bob is so lovely and just did what he needed to do, he knew when to turn on the charm.' Mr Pursey, of Burnham-on-Sea, served with the 12th Lancers tank regiment in France, Belgium and Germany during World War Two. War veteran Harold Pursey left Bob £666 to pay for his on-going care when he died of heart failure in 2010 . The lifelong bachelor needed to go into residential care in June 2009 after his health deteriorated due to old age and Lymphedema in his legs. But he refused to go into a home without Bob, who had been his only companion since getting him as a puppy ten years earlier. Social worker Judith believed that separating him from the dog 'would have killed' him and set about finding a residential home that would take them both. Following a lengthy search, the pair settled into Burnham Lodge where Bob became an instant favourite with residents. He began doing the rounds with nurses as they handed out medication and visited patients. Staff agreed to sign a contract saying they would adopt Bob when Mr Pursey died in 2010 at the age of 94. Bob has recently required medical treatment for his stiff joints and racked up big medical bills on acupuncture, hydrotherapy and canine massage . The labrador was left £666 by his owner - who had no more money to his name - which went straight into a trust fund for his care. Ms Alder said: 'The thing is Bob is getting a bit old and he needs a lot of different things to help him. 'He gets hydrotherapy and acupuncture for his arthritis and he has just started canine massage. 'The poor lad has had his health issues, it is hard to say what we would usually spend on him because it really does vary.

"By . Matt Chorley and Rupert Steiner . PUBLISHED: . 07:45 EST, 25 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:39 EST, 25 November 2013 . Royal Bank of Scotland has called in lawyers to investigate claims it ruined successful small firms to maximise its own profits. The state-backed lender has hired legal firm Clifford Chance after a damning report said it acted like a ‘hit squad’ by deliberately causing healthy businesses to go bust. Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was 'appalled' by the claims which Chancellor George Osborne said were 'shocking'. It is understood the allegations focus on RBS' Global Restructuring Group (GRG) lending division, which handles loans classed as being risky . RBS and Lloyds faced claims they ‘harmed their customers through their decisions and caused their financial downfall’. In the worst cases, RBS withdrew lines of credit for previously solvent firms by charging eye-watering fees and charges so it could then seize their assets – typically property – at knockdown prices. Lloyds Banking Group is also singled out in the extraordinary allegations in an independent report commissioned by the Government. Entrepreneur Lawrence Tomlinson was asked by Mr Cable to look into small business lending. He accuses many of Britain’s banks of ‘heavy-handed profiteering and abhorrent behaviour’. Mr Cable has passed the report . to Sir Andrew Large - the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, . who has also published his full review into small business lending at . RBS today. Chancellor George Osborne (left) said the report was 'shocking' while Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was 'appalled' at the idea banks forced healthy business to go bust . A spokeswoman for RBS - 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer - confirmed that it had now hired law firm Clifford Chance to look into the claims. Ross McEwan, the banking group’s new chief executive, confirmed lawyers had been called in in a a letter to Sir Andrew. He did not make direct reference to the Tomlinson report, but wrote: 'To ensure our customers can have full confidence in our commitment to them, I have asked the law firm Clifford Chance to conduct an inquiry into this matter, reporting back to me in the new year.' Royal Bank of Scotland staff are turning away too many small business loans at an early stage partly because they face increasing sanctions for putting through applications that 'turn bad', a review has found. The report by former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Andrew Large found that up to 10 per cent of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) rejected at a pre-application stage may in fact be suitable for financing. It means that while state-backed RBS performs better than other lenders on dealing with SME loan applications, this is partly due to the fact that it screens out more potential borrowers before the application stage, Sir Andrew found. The report also made reference to accusations about the bank 'hastening the failure of businesses' in some cases that are also the subject of a report by Business Secretary Vince Cable's adviser Lawrence Tomlinson. SME financing is critical because it is seen as key to a sustainable economic recovery. But overall RBS, which is 80 per cent-owned by the taxpayer, converted one in four of all business approaches into lending, slightly lower than the market average. He admitted RBS 'over-corrected for the reckless lending practices that broke this bank five years ago'. 'We can never return to those days again and your report recognises the steps we have taken to re-balance and stabilise the bank. 'But in many cases the pendulum of risk aversion has swung too hard to one side. As you have identified, there are loans that we could, and should, be making, but are not.' Last night Mr Tomlinson said if it was proved there was ‘systematic and institutional fraud’ at the banks, ‘you should see people going to jail’. His . report reserved its most damning criticism for taxpayer-backed RBS and . Lloyds. He said: ‘It is undeniable that some of the banks, RBS and . Lloyds in particular, are harming their customers through their . decisions and causing their financial downfall.’ The . allegation will be a major embarrassment for both lenders and the . Government, which owns an 82 per cent stake in RBS and 43 per cent in . Lloyds. Mr . Tomlinson, the founding chairman of the LNT Group, which employs more . than 2,000 people, told Channel 4 News: ‘We’re really concerned that the . businesses aren’t really struggling and are pushed over the edge. And . then these extra fees tip them over administration, and then you’ve got . the loss of jobs but end up with RBS owning the property. ‘If it is proved that this is systemic . and institutional fraud, and there is quite a lot of evidence from . people within the bank that this is the case, then the relevant action . should be taken. If people have had their livelihoods stolen from them, . you should see people going to jail.’ The report claims to have uncovered . ‘very concerning patterns of behaviour leading to the destruction of . good and viable UK businesses’. It suggests RBS engineered businesses . to default on their loans to move them into a special division called . Global Restructuring Group (GRG). Once in GRG the firms were then hit . with exorbitant rates and fees, which in some cases caused them to . collapse, allowing RBS to buy their property and assets on the cheap, . the report claims. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds ¿harmed their customers through their decisions and caused their financial downfall¿, according to the bombshell report . Eddie Warren and his wife Cheryl lost more than £1million, their livelihood and their marriage after borrowing from RBS. The . couple bought the Bold Hotel in Southport in 2007 for £3.7 million, . using £1.2million of their own money and  taking out a loan from the . bank. A . condition of the loan was that they had to take out an interest rate . swap to protect them when base rates increased, but this led to them . paying high fixed interest on their loans and an additional £120,000 a . year in penalties as rates tumbled. After the hotel was placed in RBS’s . Global Restructuring Group it was valued at just £1.8 million. By the . autumn of 2011, the business was pushed into administration. RBS property company West Register bought the hotel for £1.4 million several months later. The . bank claims the business may only just break even when it is sold but . Mr Warren says it could soon be worth £4 million as the property market . recovers. He said: ‘They stole it. Even if the property market was depressed it would be worth £3 million.’ Mr Cable said he was 'appalled' by what Mr Tomlinson found. 'I was appalled by what he said... just to explain Lawrence Tomlinson is what we call an entrepreneur in residence. 'He’s . a Yorkshire businessperson who had himself had a lot of problems with . RBS but he compiled a dossier of cases which suggested that there was a . systematic pattern here going back to 2009 where good companies which . weren’t bringing enough fee income to the bank were being brought down . deliberately.' Mr Tomlinson said he was calling for ‘immediate action to stop this unscrupulous treatment of businesses’. The report recommends that RBS and . Lloyds be made significantly smaller, removing conflicts of interest . within the banks, and creating a number of smaller, purely retail . commercial banks. The Mail launched its Make the Banks .

South African police who gunned down 34 striking miners in the tragedy dubbed the Marikana Massacre had put in an advanced order for enough mortuary vans to carry 32 bodies, an inquiry heard. The revelation adds weight to suggestions that officers were preparing for the worst when they confronted up to 3,000 workers near the Marikana mine in August last year. The Marikana Commission of Inquiry, which was set up to investigate the tragedy, has heard how police had asked the health department for four mortuary vans, which were each able to carry eight bodies, to be sent to the site hours before the clashes.

A Colonel Classen, from the South African Police Service, allegedly said he was going to 'close down the miners' when he put in the order.

Since then there have been several fatal incidents . Under pressure: President Jacob Zuma . In the days after the killings, South African prosecutors then sparked . outrage when they charged 270 miners with . the murders of their striking colleagues at the Lonmin Platinum Mine near Rustenburg.

According to scientists, a pioneering way to remove unsightly chin fat has had promising results in early trials. Four injections of an agent known as ATX-101 into the chin led to the production of cells that ‘gobbled up’ spare fat which was reabsorbed into the body. A pioneering way to remove unsightly chin fat has had promising results in early trials. Four injections of an agent known as ATX-101 into the chin led to the production of cells that 'gobbled up' spare fat, which was reabsorbed into the body . The ‘happiness rating’ of patients with their new appearance doubled after treatment, compared with a ‘dummy’ agent. Matt Gass, of the British Association of Dermatologists, said: ‘This research is a very exciting step towards a safe and non-surgical solution to removing unwanted chin fat. ‘For people experiencing negative psychological effects of this unwanted fat on their appearance, this procedure, if approved, may open up the option of minimally invasive treatment with proven efficacy.’ At present, people who are unhappy with a double chin - or more - can turn to liposuction or have neck and face lifts to get rid of the excess. The 'happiness rating' of patients (not pictured) with their new appearance doubled after treatment, compared with a 'dummy' agent. But these treatments are not suitable for everyone, and the need for anaesthesia, an operating room and qualified staff substantially increases costs and risks. There are other non-surgical approaches available, including the non-invasive use of vacuum therapy to break up pockets of fat combined with Multiple Radio Frequency to encourage tightening afterwards. However, a limited number of clinical trials have been published showing the effectiveness of the various techniques. The new treatment targets unappealing fat deposits beneath the chin, otherwise known as submental fat, or more colloquially as a ‘double chin’. Dermatologists from the UK, France, Germany, Belgium and Spain investigated the effect of injections of ATX-101 - a synthetically derived form of the bile acid, deoxycholic acid - into the fat. ATX-101 reduces submental fat by irreversibly disrupting fat cell membranes and causing destruction of fat cells. The injections trigger an inflammatory response that promotes the arrival of highly specialised cells called macrophages into the chin fat. These ‘gobble up’ the debris resulting from destruction of the fat cells over time, with the unwanted fat being reabsorbed into the body. In the trial, 363 men and women aged 18 to 65 had four injections four weeks apart of the active agent or a dummy placebo, says a report published in the British Journal of Dermatology. Only those with moderate to severe submental fat who expressed dissatisfaction with the appearance of their face and chin were eligible to take part. The findings showed significantly more ATX-101 recipients had improvements in 5-point fat ratings scale by a doctor and by themselves on a 7-point satisfaction scale. The trial used two different dosages of ATX-101 as well as a placebo. At present, people who are unhappy with a double chin can turn to liposuction or have neck and face lifts to get rid of the excess (pictured). But these treatments are not suitable for everyone, and the need for anaesthesia, an operating room and qualified staff increases costs and risks . With the higher dosage of ATX-101, 65 per cent of patients had a reduction in submental fat of at least one point on the fat rating scale compared with 23 per cent with the placebo. Two thirds patients were happy with their face and chin appearance, versus 29 per cent for the placebo. In addition, measurements using a calliper showed a significant reduction in submental fat, with no apparent worsening of skin looseness. Following treatment, patients also reported a reduction in the psychological impact they felt due to the appearance of their face and chin. The treatment was found to invoke just a mild inflammatory response and the procedure was well tolerated by patients. Lead author Professor Berthold Rzany said ‘This study demonstrates that subcutaneous injections with ATX-101 yield a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in unwanted submental fat, decrease the psychological impact on patients, and are well tolerated. ‘This study and three additional phase III clinical trials of ATX-101 will provide the first true evidence base for non-surgical submental fat reduction.’","Dermatologists from the UK, France, .

NHS doctors are referring gay patients to psychologists to ‘cure’ them of their sexuality, ministers were warned today. MPs lined up to call for an end to the 'voodoo psychology' and bogus claims that people can be 'cured' of their sexuality. Health minister Norman Lamb said the practice was 'utterly abhorrent' and warned no GP funded by the NHS should be referring patients for treatment to change their sexuality but ruled out statutory regulation. Anger: Labour MP Sandra Osborne warned that conversion therapy poses a very real and present danger in Britain . A survey of 1,300 mental health . professionals in 2009 found that 300 admitted to having attempted to . change the sexuality of at least one patient. More . than a third said their patients had been referred to them by GPs and . 40 per cent were treated in an NHS practice, Mrs Osborne added. Labour MP Sharon Osborne said so-called conversion therapy poses a ‘very real and present danger in Britain’, as she demanded the government act to ban it. “Conversion” or “reparative” therapy is the attempt by individuals, often posing as professionals, to try and alter the sexuality of lesbian, gay or bisexual patients. Mrs Osborne told MPs: ‘Conversion therapy is a very real and present danger in Britain. ‘More than just a problem amongst religious fundamentalists, it’s an issue for the NHS and professional sector; and that this isn’t a simplistic debate about freedom to choose: if LGBT patients are coaxed into undertaking therapy by peer pressure or referred on to conversion therapists after approaching professionals, then this is hardly a “free choice” at all.’ Labour MP Sandra Osborne . Conversion therapy was a systemic problem in the 1950s and 1960s with teachers, NHS staff and the courts referring gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) to medical experts to try to ‘turn’ them straight. Mrs Osborne added: During this period, all branches of psychology – from the cognitive, to the behavioural and the psychodynamic – had their own cruel and unpalatable methods of dealing with same-sex attraction. ‘Conversion therapy persisted and psychotherapy remains an unregulated profession in Britain. ‘Anyone in the country can set themselves up as a psychotherapist without being part of a professional body.’ Offensive: This advert by Core Issues Trust was due to run on London buses for two weeks before it was pulled by Boris Johnson last year . Debate: MPs from all the main parties attended the debate in Westminster Hall to demand the government act . She warned that because many NHS staff received their training before homosexuality ceased to be classed as a mental illness. ‘Many professionals, quite simply, receive little training in what to do when a gay person approaches them expressing uneasiness about their sexuality. ‘There is a legitimate concern that some professionals in the NHS and elsewhere are referring LGBT patients on to conversion therapists.’ Voodoo: Lib Dem MP said conversion therapy had no place in 21st century Britain . She called for psychotherapy become a . protected profession in which nobody can legally call themselves a . ‘psychotherapist’ without being accredited to a professional body, like . the Health and Care Professions Council. ‘The government’s current plans for a voluntary register of psychotherapists just don’t cut it.’ Last . year Boris Johnson blocked Christian campaigners from using . advertisements on London buses to promote their message on . homosexuality. The London . Mayor personally vetoed the campaign, which was due to start next week, . because he said it suggested gay people can be cured. The posters were backed by two Christian groups, the Core Issues Trust and Anglican Mainstream. Post-gay and ex-gay are terms used to refer to homosexuals who have undergone spiritual or pastoral therapy and, according to Anglican Mainstream, have 'now left a homosexual lifestyle'. Mrs Osborne told a Westminster Hall debate there must also be a better complaints system so that LGBT patients can ‘achieve justice’ if they are forced to undergo conversion therapy. ‘The Government could opt to ban conversion therapy for all under 18s - or go further with an all out ban for all age groups. ‘But then would an all out ban address the much broader issue of inadequate training of professionals in how to provide LGBT friendly public service provision.’ In July a petition was presented to Parliament with 2,000 signatures which stated that ‘being lesbian, gay or bi-sexual is not a disease, disorder or illness and cannot therefore be “cured” or changed’. It warned ‘that “conversion” or “reparative” therapy does not work and can do serious harm to patients’. Health minister Norman Lamb said the practice was 'utterly abhorrent' but ruled out statutory regulation at this stage . Lib Dem MP Stephen Gilbert said: ''In the 21st century no lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender indivudal should be accessing this kind of voodoo psychology. 'Instead we should be providing services which help give them confidence and support them with their sexuaility.' Health minister Mr Lamb has faced calls to ban conversion therapy in the past, but has insisted it was up to local NHS bodies. Today he told MPs: 'I find this practice utterly abhorrent and has no place in a modern society. That’s my personal view.' He said many of the questions raised in the debate were questions he had asked of ministers. ‘Being lesbian, gay or bisexual is not an illness to be treated or cured. We are concerned about this issue of so-called gay-to-straight conversion therapy.’ He said the Department of Health was ‘not aware’ of NHS doctors commissioning conversion therapy. ‘It is completely inappropriate for any GP to be referring people for this type of therapy. It’s not something that public money should have anything to do with.’","MPs from all parties call on government to act to ban practice .

The twin grandchildren of entertainment tycoon Walt Disney have been locked in a battle royale over a $400 million fortune since 2009 and it will all come to a head December 5 when the two sides finally meet in a California court. Michelle Lund and her brother Brad Lund haven’t spoken in four years as they each try to wrest control of the massive trust fund left to them when their mother, Disney’s youngest daughter Sharon Disney Lund, died in 1993. On one side of the bitter family feud are Brad and the twins’ father Bill Lund. On the other are Michelle and the fund’s trustees, with both sides accusing the other of incompetence, wrongdoing, and flat-out greed. Disney v. Disney: The twin grandchildren of Walt Disney, Brad Lund (left) and Michelle Lund (right)  daughter are embroiled in a bitter, four-year-long family feud over their $400 million chunk of the entertainment empire left to them by their mother . Trust fund: They are the children of Walt's daughter Sharon, who stipulated in her will that Brad and Michelle should each receive lump sums of tens of millions every 5 years as well as more regular installments, to be doled out by a group of trustees . The saga began in 2009 after Michelle, who lives in Newport Beach, California, suddenly fell ill after a night out with friends. Before she even turned 40, she’d suffered a devastating aneurysm. Family members gathered around her, expecting the worst. Even as she lay in a hospital fighting for her life, Michelle’s family began to squabble. Bill Lund wanted to move his daughter to a Arizona, where he lives. According to NBC News, the estate’s trustees objected and filed suit against him. A family company: On their way to Europe on the Queen Elizabeth at right are Sharon Disney at 13, alongside her father Walt, mother Lillian (center) and sister Diane at 16 (left) Michelle made a miraculous recovery, but the wounds first opened before she’d even returned to her feet have been slower to heal. The twins haven’t spoken since 2009, when the trustees stopped paying out Brad’s payments from the estate. In a statement to NBC, the trustees write that under the terms set by his late mother they have, ‘full discretion to withhold distributions if (the beneficiary) doesn’t demonstrate the maturity and financial ability to manage the funds wisely.’ Michelle and the trustees say Brad suffers from a ‘chronic cognitive disability’ and have claimed he has Down’s Syndrome, a condition with which he’s never been diagnosed. Fit to be a millionaire? The debate centers around Brad Lund's (pictured) fitness to receive the millions. Michelle and the trustees say he's incompetent and have withheld his cash for years . Lines drawn: The twins' father Bill Lund, who once helped his father-in-law scout out the Florida land that would become Disney World, has taken Brad's side. His daughter Michelle says he's just after the money . They also maintain that Bill Lund—who is wealthy in his own right and was pivotal in helping his late father-in-law stake out the Orlando land that would one day become Disney World—has taken advantage of his son in order personally profit from the $1 million per year he’s due from the trust. The father and son deny wrongdoing and in their suit to take control of Brad’s money away from the trustees they allege that Michelle is the one who is incompetent because she suffered ‘permanent brain damage’ as a result of her aneurysm. Bill admits his son has ‘some learning issues’ but is adamant he’s able to manage his own money and should be allowed to do so. He says the trustees are the ones behaving unlawfully. ‘It’s their career,’ Bill told NBC. ‘This is tragic. If Walt were here he’d be appalled. He’d be absolutely appalled and so would Sharon at the way the trustees have acted.’ Brad Lund agreed. He believes the trustees are the ones steering the ship, not his sister. ‘She’s being controlled by someone who’s got the remote control,’ he said. ‘Like she’s a robot. We’ve been at this for four years.’ Back in 2010 as the fight was still only heating up, Michelle Lund told the Arizona Republic that she only wants what’s best for her brother. ‘I'm not doing this to hurt my father,’ she said. ‘I'm doing this because it is the right thing to do…I do think Brad needs protection.’ Once close siblings, Walt Disney's grandkids Michelle and Brad Lund are now embroiled in a battle over their $400 and haven't spoken in four years. On one side are Brad Lund and the twins' father Bill Lund. They say the trustees, who haven't paid Brad his multi-million installments in years, are controlling Michelle like a 'robot.' Late aunt: Diane Disney Miller, aunt to the twins and daughter to Walt, died just last Tuesday. She and two of the twins' half sisters petitioned in a Maricopa County, Arizona court to have a guardian appointed to her nephew Brad in the belief Bill was taking advantage of him . In the other corner are Michelle and the trustees. They say Brad is mentally incompetent and cannot handle the millions and go so far as to suggest he has Down's Syndrome, though he's never been diagnosed. THE FEUD BEGINS . The battle began Labor Day 2009 after Michelle had a near fatal aneurysm. As she fought for her life, her father tried to move her to Arizona, where he lives. The trustees then filed suit to stop him. When Michelle recovered, she joined them. Now Bill is fighting alongside Brad to wrest control of Brad's funds away from the trustees. They she suffered brain damage as a result of her aneurysm. WORRIES OVER COMPETENCE . After the suit over where Michelle should be treated came a suit over Brad's care. He had been living for years with Bill, a stepsister, and Bill's current wife Sherry. But . family including the twins' half sisters (Bill's daughter's from . another marriage) and the twins' aunt Diane Disney Miller (the older . sister of their mother Sharon) worried he was being used for his money. VIEW A FAMILY TREE OF THE FEUDING PARTIES . In a Maricopa County, Ariziona court filing, they called him 'a virtual captive' in the home, though brad has denied this. 'I . trusted him, I loved him, I admired him,' Michelle told The Arizona . Republic. 'Now, I love him, not the way I used to. He is not the man I . once knew.' Co-trustee L. Andrew Gifford concurred and placed the blame on Bill, who was once a part of the trust but claims to have stepped down for medical reasons. 'I have no desire to destroy the Lund family,' said Gifford. 'Bill was forced out of the trust by his own misconduct.' After four years of legal challenges and counter challenges, the two sides finally meet in court December 5. Troubled legacy: ¿This is tragic. If Walt were here he¿d be appalled. He¿d be absolutely appalled and so would Sharon at the way the trustees have acted,' said Bill Lund . Trust-worthy? Michelle Lund (left) along with the trustees like attorney L. Andrew Gifford, are themselves accused of misdoings in the lawsuit, which after four years finally sees a California court December 5.

The SFO’s inquiries are at an early stage and a full-scale formal investigation has not yet been launched. The Royal Bank of Scotland is facing a criminal investigation over accusations it deliberately killed off small businesses for its own gain . A spokesman for the SFO said: ‘We are aware of the issue and are monitoring developments.’ It is weighing up whether the bank was engaged in poor business practice that remained within the law, or whether it crossed the line into criminal behaviour. This week RBS was accused of engineering the destruction of ‘good and viable UK businesses’. The allegations were made in a damning report by Lawrence Tomlinson, the ‘entrepreneur in residence’ at the Department of Business. Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was ‘appalled’ by the study, while Chancellor George Osborne described the claims as ‘shocking’. The report suggested the lender manipulated customers into committing minor breaches of their loan terms in order to shunt them into a special division known as the Global Restructuring Group (GRG). Business Secretary Vince Cable (left) said he was ‘appalled’ by the study, while Chancellor George Osborne (right) described the claims as ‘shocking’ Once in the clutches of the GRG, the firms were hit with exorbitant interest rates and fees, causing some to collapse. That enabled RBS to strip their assets at rock-bottom prices, it was claimed. The SFO is examining some of the cases in the Tomlinson report. City watchdogs the Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority are also launching inquiries and RBS has started its own investigation led by top City lawyer Clifford Chance. It has also emerged that the bank’s lending to small businesses has collapsed by £17billion since it was rescued by the taxpayer in 2008. At its peak, RBS lent £55billion to small firms. Now, it is £38billion, according to a report by Sir Andrew Large, former Bank of England deputy governor.","Serious Fraud Office poised to probe bank’s treatment of customers .

Concerns: Michale Gove is having to delay his decision while lawyers check if the plans breach rules which ban new grammar schools . Plans for the most significant addition to the grammar school sector in 50 years are being stalled by Education Secretary Michael Gove because he is concerned they are illegal. Two grammar schools have submitted rival applications for an ‘annexe’ which could take up to 1,300 pupils. The vast site in Sevenoaks, Kent, will have its own staff, although it will share a headteacher, department heads and answer to the same governing body. Kent council approved the applications which were then sent to the Department for Education five months ago. But Mr Gove has not made a final decision because lawyers are checking whether they breach rules that allow existing grammar schools to expand, but ban new ones. If Mr Gove eventually approves the plans it is likely to open the floodgates for similar applications by other local authorities. He will also face accusations from Labour that he is expanding the selective system by the back door and condemning children who fail the 11-plus exam to a second-rate education. In a letter to Sevenoaks Tory MP Michael Fallon last month, Mr Gove wrote: ‘We must judge the proposals carefully to test whether they represent new schools or expansions.’ A Kent County Council spokesman said: ‘It’s a first which is why there has possibly been a delay. It’s like a completely new school.’ Dr Phil Limbert, chief executive of Valley Invicta Academies Trust, which is behind one of the bids which would expand Invicta Grammar in Maidstone, added: ‘It’s bound to be a politically difficult decision. It is the first significant move forward since the last new grammar school opened in the 1960s.’ Weald of Kent Grammar in Tonbridge is the other applicant. The details emerged after Sir John Major reignited the debate around social mobility this month. The former prime minister, who went to a grammar school, said it was ‘truly shocking’ that the privately educated dominate politics and influential professions. Supporters of selective state education say it is one of the most effective means of improving social mobility. Kent, which is fully selective county, meaning all children have the opportunity to take the 11-plus, has 101 secondary schools, including 32 grammars. A surge in births means it must find thousands of extra places over the next few years. The pressure is particularly acute in Sevenoaks where there are no grammars, meaning children have to travel more than 30 miles a day to get to the nearest selective school. It is hoped the new site would start taking pupils by September 2015. There would be around 180 places each year for 11 to 16-year-olds and a sixth form for another 300 to 400 pupils. In 1947 there were 1,207 state-funded grammars in England teaching 37.8 per cent of secondary school pupils. Choice: Kent is a fully selective county meaning all children have the opportunity to take the 11-plus and has 101 secondary schools, including 32 grammars . Labour introduced legislation abolishing grammar schools in the 1970s and by the middle of the decade there were just 675 catering for 12 per cent of children. A record low of 3 per cent was reached in 1986. Since then, the 164 remaining grammars in seven fully selective local authorities and 29 partially selective areas have managed to increase their share to 5 per cent through expansion. New admission rules introduced in 2011 stated councils could no longer block the expansion of existing schools – whether comprehensives or grammar. Sarah Shilling, of the Sevenoaks Grammar School Campaign, said: ‘When Michael Gove said well-performing selective grammar schools could expand in the same way as good non-selective schools, I don’t think he realised what he was saying.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We believe strongly that good schools – including grammars – should be able to expand. The law prohibits the establishment of a new selective school. ‘We are currently assessing proposals for a site in Sevenoaks. No decision has been made.’","Two grammar schools have submitted rival applications for an ‘annexe’ which could take up to 1,300 pupils .

Jen Palmer (pictured) and her husband John have threatened to a lawsuit against Kleargear.com after it fined them $3,500 for posting a negative review . A couple who were charged $3,500 for writing a bad review about an online shop have fought back and filed their own $75,000 lawsuit. Jen and John Palmer say their credit rating was damaged by the Kleargear.com fine and have appointed Public Citizen to represent them. Mr Palmer ordered a trinket from the company in 2008 but the order was cancelled when it was not delievered within 30 days. Mrs Palmer then wrote a negative review on Ripoffreport.com, slamming the retailer's 'incompetent customer service' and 'refusal to ship products to San Antonio, Texas'. However, Kleargear sent them a demand notice three years later to get the review removed and when that was not done fined them $3,500. The company claimed Mrs Parlmer had violated a 'non-disparagement clause' buried in the sale terms and conditions. The couple, who live in Layton, Utah, say Kleargear reported their 'debt' to credit agencies, and say they have since been rejected by numerous lenders. For the Palmers, it all started nearly five years ago when John decided to order his wife a desk ornament from the Texas-based Kleargear.com as a Christmas gift. The company was unable to deliver the trinket worth less than $20 within 30 days and ultimately cancelled the order altogether, leading Mrs Palmer to complain about 'horrible customer service practices' in her online review. 'Once we put the review up we pretty much forgot about it,' Jen Palmer, an executive assistant, told ABC News. 'It was no different than writing a review, good or bad, about any company.' But the long-forgotten written critique came to haunt the couple last summer when John Palmer, a network engineer, got an email from Kleargear demanding a $3,500 fee for disparaging the company in violation of its Terms of Use. 'We were blown away,' Mrs Palmer recalled their reaction to the demand. Nonprofit group Public Citizen have now sent a letter to Kleargear threatning to file a lawsuit unless the situation is remedied. They have given them until December 16 to rectify the situation with the credit reporting agencies and to compensate them $75,000. The letter to Kleargear states the damaged credit rating meant they were refused a $1,900 loan for a new furnace which left them and their 3-year-old son without heating for three weeks. A credit card and a car loan application were also rejected and they are struggling to sell their home and buy a new one, it said. When the family disputed the debt with credit reporting agencies, Kleargear demanded a $50 'dispute fee' on top of the $3,500. Mrs Palmer told ABC News they were 'floored' when they received the letter. She said: 'The threat of doing it was scary enough, but the extent to which they did it blew my mind.' She said she attempted to get the review removed from the website but when that failed refused to pay the fine. This is Jen Palmer's critical post on ripoffreport.com for which she was fined $3,500 . The Kleargear clause stated: 'In an effort to ensure fair and . honest public feedback, and to prevent the publishing of libelous . content in any form, your acceptance of this sales contract prohibits . you from taking any action that negatively impacts kleargear.com, its . reputation, products, services, management or employees.' Kleargear.com appears to have removed . the clause from its terms of sale within the last couple months. It . appeared on the website as recently as August 2013. The couple's attorney, Scott Michelman, told ABC: 'No one would have expected this . from doing perfectly normal, everyday and perfectly legal things.' 'I have the right to tell somebody else these guys ripped me off,' Palmer said. KUTV previously said the company defended its policy, saying the clause was a 'term of sale'. The company also said requiring Palmer to remove the . post or face a fine was a 'diligent effort to help them avoid [the fine]'. Mail Online has attempted to contact Kleargear for comment. Jen Palmer claims she and her husband have been rejected by several lenders because Kleangear.com reported her 'delinquency' to credit companies . Jen Palmer (pictured with son) said the family had applications for a credit card and a car loan rejected . Palmer is not the first person to complain about the retailer, with dozens of similar criticisms on Ripoffreport.com. Moreover, the Better Business Bureau slapped the company . with an 'F rating' in 2010 for 'not delivering products purchased . online in a timely manner'. Kleargear.com today has a 'B rating'. Salt Lake City First Amendment attorney, Jeff Hunt a judge would likely consider a non-disparagement clause unconstitutional. 'I . think this is outrageous that a company like this would force a . consumer to relinquish their first amendment rights to speak about their . product as a condition of sale,' Hunt told KUTV. 'I have a serious question about whether a court would enforce that kind of covenant because it's massively over broad and against public policy.'","Jen and John Palmer say credit rating damaged by Kleargear fee .

The final autopsy report for Chicago chef Charlie Trotter has been released, revealing that he died due to a stroke. The 54-year-old chef was found dead in his Chicago home by his young son earlier this month, and now the medical examiner's office has given more information about the chef's health problems. They concluded that he 'died of a cerebrovascular accident (a stroke) as a consequence of hypertensive arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease (high blood pressure).' Final appearance: Charlie Trotter spoke at a culinary conference and he flew to Wyoming to attend just three days before he was found dead . The Monday report made it clear that 'neither drugs nor alcohol contributed to his death', according to The Chicago Tribune. Another concern that came immediately after his November 5 death was that Trotter, who had closed his eponymous restaurant in 2012, would exacerbate his supposed brain aneurysm by traveling but the medical examiner has ruled that out. 'There is no scientific evidence to indicate that recent travel contributed to his death, though there was evidence of a prior stroke,' the report read. His wife Rochelle Trotter put out a statement in the days following his death, confirming that he had been cleared to fly and had permission from medical experts to attend a food conference in Wyoming just three days before he was found dead. She said that her husband learned of his brain aneurysm in January and had been taking the 'proper medication. Better days: Rochelle Trotter (left) said that her husband Charlie (right) learned about his brain aneurysm in January and had been treating it with the 'proper medication' at the time of his death . She denied the claims made in the . police report from the officers who responded to Trotter's death, saying . that they were wrong to say that he flew to Wyoming 'against medical . advice'. Mrs Trotter did not . specifically say which doctors cleared him, but did say that 'medical . experts' said it was fine for him to fly. 'The autopsy indicates the travel is not connected with his death,' she said, referring to the initial autopsy report. A sommelier who worked with Trotter and became a close friend over their years of working together said that doctors had told Trotter not to fly to avoid adding pressure to his brain. 'It was a time bomb, and he felt that he didn't have a lot of time left,' sommelier Larry Stone told The Chicago Tribune. The last picture? Trotter spoke at a culinary conference in Jackson Hole and one audience member noticed that his left hand- seen in his pocket while posing with attendee Megan Gallagher- was shaking . 'It was inoperable, and it was not something that could be repaired; it was deep inside the brain.' Mr Stone told the paper that his 54-year-old former boss had multiple seizures in the time leading up to his death. The first hints of trouble came last year when he closed his award-winning restaurant after 25 years, saying that he wanted to spend more time with his family and study philosophy. That didn't keep him from staying active, in spite of doctor's orders. Nothing . seemed particularly unusual about Trotter during the Jackson Hole conference, but . one audience member did notice that the chef's left hand was shaking . slightly as he held the microphone. Friends: Chef Anthony Bourdain (center left) and his wife Ottavia (right) hugs Trotter and his wife Rochelle Smith (center right) at a food event in Miami in February of last year . The chef's wife Rochelle was seen by neighbors screaming and crying hysterically as ambulances arrived at their home after Trotter's son Dylan found his father unconscious. 'He was much loved and words cannot describe how much he will be missed,' she said in a statement. 'His impact upon American cuisine and the culinary world at large will always be remembered.' Multi-course tasting menus that are now seen on many fine dining establishments were his handiwork, as he traded the 10-course menu at his flagship restaurant on a daily basis and boasted that frequent customers never had the same thing twice. He had a great influence on both the local and national food scene, one that many expect to be felt for years to come. Passed: Charlie Trotter's body, seen here in August 2012, was discovered by his son in their Chicago home . Wine was a passion for Trotter, and when asked at the event in Jackson Hole what he would like for his final meal, he said he wanted only the best: a bottle of 1900 Chateau Margaux, a wine that costs up to $16,000. During an interview when he decided to close his restaurant, he revealed his grand plans for what would happen to his restaurant's 26,000-strong wine cellar after it closed last year. 'I did a mathematical . calculation: If I live to the average life expectancy of the American . male — 78.9 — and I consume one bottle of wine every day, I should . consume the last bottle on my last day on this planet,' he said in an . interview with The New York Times.","Charlie Trotter, 54, was found dead in his Chicago home on November 5 .

Women have been paying the price of wearing high heels for years suffering from sore feet, aching legs and a bad back for a height and style boost. But now a brand say they can offer a three-and-a-half-inch shoe that is both comfortable and stylish. British brand Hotter have created the Boutique by Hotter collection which they describe as fashionable and elegant - but best of all comfy. Impressed: Podiatrist Emma Supple put different styles of Hotter's 'most comfortable shoes you'll ever wear' to the test . Founder of the Lancashire-based company, Stewart Houlgrave, said he's always strived to 'create and design shoes as comfortable as slippers'. Doing this when it comes to heels is no mean feat but they say they have achieved it thanks to using a stable block heel, flexible sole, soft leather linings and cushioning at ball and heel of the foot. But this is no ordinary cushioning - it's Egyptian-inspired cushioning made with a 'pyramid construction'. A spokesman for the brand explains: 'Pyramid technology puts science into comfort. Hidden deep inside the shoe sole is a pyramid-shaped foam pad which contracts and traps air as you walk, acting as a cushion to the balls of your feet where pressure can be constant. 'Placed directly above the flexi grooves of the shoes' sole, the special pads enhance flexibility and soften this part of the insole. 'In Boutique by Hotter, styles are enhanced with an added layer of foam at the heel to making them the most comfortable fashion styles you'll ever wear.' The claims will be welcome news to the thousands of women who suffer from foot, leg and back pain thanks to their love of high heels. Happy feet: Hotter's Boutique collection comes in styles for work and play and use pyramid cushioning for a comfortable fit. The buckle style called 'glamour', far left, is £95, while the red and silver glitter 'admire' shoes are £85 each . The dangers of high heels include compression of the spine, damage to the joints and developing bunions and blisters from the way the toes are pushed forward into the end of the shoe. But are Hotter's claims that they've designed comfortable heels too good to be true? Femail asked podiatrist Emma Supple to put them to the test. She said: When I wore them I immediately felt the . comfort of the cushioning. The stacked, blocked - yet elegant - heel was . noticeably effective. No rubbing, full cushioning and easy to walk on.' The foot expert said she was 'very impressed' with the fit and feel of the shoe - and was especially pleased they they are available in half sizes. Beauty is pain: Many women feel the pinch from wearing high heels, they can also cause damage to joints . She said: 'They fit really well with that all important half size. It will be a pleasure to add Hotter shoes to the list of where to get shoes that really fit to those of us with half sizes. M&S and some specialist areas seemed to be the last to maintain this British sizing.' Emma wore the shoes to a recent world conference in podiatry in Rome where she said had the opportunity to test the comfort of the shoes and see what her podiatrist peers thought of them. After putting them to the test, she concluded: 'This is a well made, accessible, flexible high heel shoe. 'The attention to detail in the placement of the heel, flexibility at the forefoot and additional forefoot padding make for a comfortable, elegant and wearable high heel shoe.' The Boutique collection is available at www.hotter.com, 50 Hotter stores nationwide or via their mail order catalogue.","British brand Hotter have created the Boutique range .

'Fighter': Nobby Stiles celebrates after the World Cup Final where England beat Germany 4-2 in 1966 having played in every game . Nobby Stiles, the ‘hard man’ of England’s 1966 World Cup-winning team, is battling prostate cancer, it was revealed yesterday. The 71-year-old former Manchester United star was diagnosed following a routine visit to his GP but doctors are hopeful he will make a full recovery. Stiles was with his family at home in Manchester yesterday and declined to comment. However, his son John, 49, confirmed the illness. ‘Thankfully it was diagnosed early and the outlook is extremely positive. We expect him to make a full recovery and are supporting him through it,’ he said. Despite his health problems, Stiles, a grandfather and father-of-three, has continued to travel the country with his son giving after-dinner speeches about his career. Stiles, who developed a fearsome reputation as a tough-tackling midfielder in his heyday, played every minute of the 1966 World Cup. He was famously photographed holding the trophy in one hand and his false teeth in the other during the post-match celebrations at Wembley. After retiring as a player he was manager of West Bromwich Albion and was the Manchester United youth team coach during the early 1990s. In 2000 he was made an MBE. News of Stiles’s illness led to a flood of ‘get well’ messages from fans and friends in the game. Former England and Manchester City star Mike Summerbee, who recently overcame prostate cancer, said: ‘Nobby was a brilliant footballer. He is a dear friend and a wonderful man. ‘I know from personal experience how you can come through this and I am sure Nobby will do the same. He is a larger than life character.’ Optimism: The former Manchester United player, pictured in 2000 receiving his OBE, has been told he can make a full recovery . John Hartson, a former Welsh . international, who survived testicular and brain cancer four years ago, . said: ‘I have no doubt Nobby Stiles can beat this. 'He was a fighter . during his playing days who would put the fear of God into opponents.’ News of his illness comes 20 years after 1966 captain Bobby Moore died from bowel cancer at the age of 51.

A Pennsylvania woman brought home more than she bargained for when a black widow spider hitched a ride in a bunch of grapes. Yvonne Whalen, of Monaghan, made the horrifying find this week while washing the fruit before eating it. The scary spider was one of two hiding in the bunch, the other died after spending a week in her refrigerator. The woman’s discovery is only the latest in a series of disturbing finds in fruit across multiple states. Deadly: Black widow spiders have enough venom to kill children and the elderly if bitten . ‘I saw the spider come up [over the grapes],’ she told ABC27. ‘I quickly dropped the colander and screamed.’ Ms Whalen explained her initial instinct was to flush it down the sink, but she instead she trapped it in a plastic container and looked for a similar spider online. It didn’t take long for her to discover she had a brush with a juvenile black widow spider. Horrified: Yvonne Whalen explains who the creepy crawler climbed out from the bunch of grapes as she washed them . Shocked: She dropped the colander and screamed, her suspicions were soon confirmed with an online search . ‘Had I known this could happen, I would have paid much more attention,’ she added. Ryan ‘The Bugman’ Bridge, a local insect expert, confirmed the woman’s suspicions to the station. ‘They are dangerous,’ he said, ‘they are venomous.’ Trapped: Ms Whalen fought her initial instinct to flush the spider down the drain, instead saving it to confirm it was a black widow . Local expert: Ryan ¿The Bugman¿ Bridge confirmed the spider was 'unmistakeably' a black widow . Ms Whalen notified Giant, the supermarket where she bought the grapes, and explained she only wanted to make sure this did not happen to anyone else. ‘I gave them a call to let them know that I found the spider, I wasn't expecting anything in return,’ she said. The chain sent her a gift card and pledged to be more diligent inspecting fruit, according to the station. Spiders have also been discovered in grapes in Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin, according to Food Safety News. It is not uncommon for the deadly creatures to be found in grapes, according to Fox News. Black widows are immediately noticeable because of the red mark on the back of their otherwise all-black bodies. They carry enough venom to cause problems for humans, and can even be fatal in some cases.","Black widow spiders have been found in bunches of grapes in four states .

Decision: David Cameron is deciding whether or not to defy Brussels to bring in harsher migrant rules . David Cameron is set to defy European rules by announcing a tough new set of obstacles for immigrants as Britain's Romanian and Bulgarian communities rapidly grow. People wishing to enter Britain will have to prove they have lived here for a year, up from three months, before they can receive benefits in one of the proposals expected to be unveiled. It is one of many goals the prime . minister will put to the EU in an attempt to negotiate a looser . relationship with Brussels ahead of a 2017 referendum. Another policy would remove child benefits from the dependent children of migrant workers, sources claim. The move is a dramatic step that goes against EU laws preventing member states from having one rule for their citizens requesting state hand-outs, and another for immigrants. If he goes ahead with the proposals, there is little Europe could do to stop him for years. The prime minister is today considering the move, which would spark yet another court battle with the European Commission over benefit restrictions and potentially tarnish the country's fragile relationship with the EU. Currently, Britain is in court with Brussels defending its right to subject migrants to 'additional tests' in order to merit state hand-outs. However, the prime minister is motivated by mounting pressure from his own voters to guarantee strict control over Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants from January 1, when they will be awarded the same freedom of movement as all EU citizens. A poll for the Mail identified deep public anxiety about the ending of transitionary immigration restrictions on new EU members Romania and Bulgaria in January. The poll found that 82 per cent did not want citizens of the two countries to gain free access to the UK, 85 per cent said they feared schools and hospitals could not cope and 76 per cent said young Britons could lose out on jobs. It also found more voters trust Labour on immigration (17 per cent) than the Tories (11 per cent). Some 44 per cent said they trusted no party. Sources claim he is encouraged by powerful nations such as Germany, Denmark and Spain also vocalising concerns over the influx of eastern European immigrants. As of next year, the people of Bulgaria and Romania . will be free to work and claim benefits in Britain. At home, pressure is mounting as at least 33 backbench Tory MPs have so far signed a petition to stop Bulgarian and Romanian immigration altogether by 2018. A cabinet minister told The Sunday Times: 'The writing is on the wall for the way the commission is behaving. Other countries have also had enough.' Tension: The prime minister is driven by mounting tension in cities like Sheffield (pictured) caused by Roma migrants . Next week, a group of Tories will unveil their own ideas on how Britain could renegotiate its relationship with Europe ahead of the election. Andrea Leadsom, Chris Heaton-Harris and Tim Loughton, from the Fresh Start Project, have identified at least five major changes to EU treaties they say should be at the heart of Britain’s renegotiation. They include reforms to protect our financial services industry and an end to limits on work hours. Tory Eurosceptics also want reforms to energy policy, the common agricultural policy, defence and immigration. Ministers are already furious that the European Commission has taken legal action to try to prevent welfare curbs on non-British EU citizens. Brussels claims making migrants show they are ‘habitual residents’ before they can claim child benefit, child tax credit, jobseeker’s allowance and state pension credit breaks the right to free movement. Migrants would have to be actively looking for work and have a realistic prospect of getting a job to claim unemployment benefits.","Prime Minister unveiling proposals to renegotiate relationship with Europe .

Detectives investigating the murder of a university graduate 17 years ago have arrested a man. Melanie Hall was 25 when she disappeared in 1996 following a reported row with her boyfriend. It was not until 2009 that her remains were found, in a bin-liner tied with blue rope at the side of a motorway. Victim: A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of Melanie Hall, pictured, who vanished in 1996. He was later released on police bail . The suspect is 44 and from Bath, where . Miss Hall was last seen alive. He was arrested at his home last Tuesday . on suspicion of murder, questioned for two days and released on police . bail. Detectives also searched a house believed to be a former home of the man in the Twerton area of Bath. The latest arrest is the fourth suspect to be questioned about Miss Hall’s murder since her remains were found. Her father Steve, who lives near Bradford-upon-Avon, Wiltshire, yesterday described the development as ‘progress’. He . said: ‘We are hopeful that progress is being made. It is a long and . painful process 17 years down the line. 'This would appear to be . connected to the appeal we made at the beginning of October, which is . great. We are keeping our minds open on these things. Appeal: Melanie's parents Steve and Pat Hall appear at a press conference in Bath four years ago after her remains were found by the M5 . ‘The . police are keeping us informed and we are hopeful. It is not the first . time someone has been arrested in connection with her death but we are . remaining positive.’ Miss . Hall, who worked in a hospital, was last seen in June 1996 after . apparently arguing with her doctor boyfriend in a nightclub. Despite a . huge police operation, no trace of her was found. In . 2009, a workman found parts of her skeleton hidden in plastic bags as . he cleared undergrowth just a few yards off the northbound slip road at . junction 14 of the M5 near Thornbury, Gloucestershire. It was nearly 30 miles from where the psychology graduate was last seen, sitting on a stool in a Cadillac’s nightclub. A . total of five bin-liners contained or covered her remains, including . arm and leg bones and her pelvis and skull. Other parts of her skeleton . were found partially buried nearby. Tragic: The remains of university graduate Miss Hall were discovered dumped alongside the M5 motorway near Bristol in 2009 . In . 2009, a man was arrested after confessing to her murder, but later . released following psychiatric tests. Two men aged 38 and 39 were . arrested on suspicion of her murder, but released in 2010. The . latest arrest follows a breakthrough last month  when a distinctive . white Volkswagen Golf GTi Cabriolet was recovered by police for forensic . tests. The white, A-registration, soft-topped vehicle is known to have . been driven in the Bath area in 1996 when Melanie was murdered. The . Golf, which is almost 30 years old, was tracked down in . Gloucestershire, although its current owner has no link to the . investigation. Officers made a second breakthrough relating to the origin of the blue rope used to bind Melanie’s body. Although mass-produced and commonly used, police confirm they have ‘a credible account’ of where it came from. Speaking . at the time, Detective Superintendent Mike Courtiour said: ‘This new . information encourages me that we may be very close to catching the . killer or killers of Melanie. ‘This has been a difficult case and it has never been closed.’ He . added: ‘Over the past four years we have received information, . intelligence and names that we have taken seriously, researched and . thoroughly investigated. ‘We have recently received information concerning the origin of the blue rope that was used to tie up Melanie’s body. ‘It is significant information and we are actively working on that line of inquiry. ‘We . are working with forensic scientists in relation to the rope and the . circumstances of where that particular length of rope came from. ‘Also, we have recently found and recovered a car that may be relevant to events in 1996 when Melanie disappeared. ‘This is currently being examined by forensic scientists.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","University graduate Melanie Hall vanished after leaving a nightclub in 1996 .

Two young members of a Boston gang have been convicted of murdering a 16-year-old boy in 2011, simply because his friend lived on a street they deemed enemy territory. Sheldon Mattis and Nyasani Watt, both 20, were found guilty of first-degree murder in Suffolk County on Friday. The verdict gave victim Jaivon Blake's mother Diane Simmons some closure after two years of torment. 'I can relax,' the mother said. 'I'm so happy, just really happy... I'm just glad that justice has been served and that my son and I can be at peace and rest.' Guilty: Sheldon Mattis, pictured left on November 12, was found guilty of murdering Jaivon Blake in 2011 . Blake, a middle school student at the Martin Luther King School in Dorchester, was an innocent casualty of a gang feud in the Bowdoin-Geneva neighborhood of Dorchester on September 25, 2011. Prosecutors said Mattis and Watt were part of a gang hell bent on killing rivals and a number of targets, including Blake and his 14-year-old friend, had been picked out based on geography to send a message. The pair selected the young boys after Blake's friend told Mattis he lived on Everton Street during a casual conversation outside a Walgreens pharmacy. Mattis patted Watt on the back as he rode off on his bike to find the boys, with his hidden .49-caliber pistol. Convicted: Nyasani Watt, pictured left on November 12, was also found guilty in the shooting death of Jaivon Blake, right . When he found them, Watt fired six rounds, striking the 14-year-old in the neck and shoulder and Blake in the spinal cord. The friend managed to run away but Blake dropped to the ground partially paralyzed and gasping for air. His brother rushed to the grisly scene and watched helplessly as paramedics tried to save the 16-year-old's life but failed. He died two hours later at Boston Medical Center. 'People of conscience should be angry about this case,' Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said following the verdict, the Boston Globe reported. 'They should be angry that two boys, just 14 and 16, would be gunned down on the streets of their own city without provocation. There's no gang or allegiance or code of conduct that can excuse this act or even make sense of it.' Relief: Blake's mother, Diane Simmons, pictured on November 12, said she left happy after Friday's conviction . As Simmons hugged her brother and friends following the guilty verdict, Mattis shook his head and mouthed 'I love you,' to his parents who sat in the courtroom. He was led away in handcuffs.# . Meanwhile, Watt's mother cried softly outside the courtroom. The pair are due to be sentenced on December 2. First-degree murder carried an automatic life sentence in Massachusetts, however Watt may get a separate sentencing hearing given he was 17 at the time of the shooting and such sentences are forbidden for juveniles after a Supreme Court decision last year. Mattis' friends and family insist he's innocent and that the case was riddled with inconsistencies. 'We're losing a son, too,' said Mattis's mother, Denise, 41, told the Boston Globe. His girlfriend, Ebony Williams, 19, ran out of the courtroom in tears after the guilty verdict. 'This makes no sense,' she later told the Globe.

The family of slain aspiring model and actress Juliana Redding maintains justice has not been served that once had prosecutors insinuating she was the victim of spurned love and a business deal gone sour. Dr. Munir Uwaygah, who has never been charged in her death, fled the United States two days after the woman accused . of brutally slaying 21-year-old aspiring model and actress Juliana . Redding for pay was arrested. Now . Redding’s family, including her father Greg Redding - who cancelled a . business deal with Uwaygah just five days before his daughter’s murder - must live with the agonizing knowledge that whoever is responsible for Juliana's death may never pay. Scroll down for video... Entangled: Dr. Munir Uwaydah (left) fled . the country two days after the woman once accused of brutally murdering Juliana Redding (right) was arrested and is now said to be living out his life in Beirut, Lebanon . Her . father, a pharmacist, had agreed to go into business with Dr Uwaydah, . managing a pharmacy and helping to develop products for a medical . manufacturing company the Lebanese American businessman had founded. This, . according to a 48 Hours investigation that portrays a sordid tale with . few winners other than, perhaps, the Lebanese-American surgeon. Kelly . Soo Park, 47, was acquitted in 2013 of charges she viciously attacked . Redding in her Santa Monica, California in 2008, bashing in her skull and strangling her so forcefully that a bone . was crushed behind her throat. Prosecutors at the time said alleged Park was carrying out orders from Uwaydah. Though . her DNA was found throughout the crime scene, prosecutors were unable to pin Park to the murder in the eyes of . the jury. Beauty: Juliana Redding was murdered in her Santa Monica apartment in 2008 and DNA from a woman who prosecutors then alleged worked for her ex-boyfriend Dr. Uwaydah was found all over her home and on her neck . While Park now . manages a Southern California restaurant, the man alleged in her trial to have . given her a six-figure payment to kill Redding remains uncharged. Friends and family members of the slain model erupted in tears and screams when the jury acquitted Park in June. Onlookers in the courtroom who knew Redding screamed obscenities and called Park a murderer. They appeared ready to pounce on Park and were held back by deputies as she turned and was led through a rear entrance. ‘Go to hell. Whore!’ was screamed by a woman in the court. ‘Somethings wrong here,’ said a female voice. ‘God bless us all.’ Jurors had been escorted out a back way before the outburst. Now . there is no one left to pay for Redding’s horrific murder and the man once named in connection to the killing is living thousands of miles and many countries away. In Park's trial, 'The prosecution's motive was that Dr Uwaydah was in business negotiations with Juliana Redding's father,' reporter Jack Leonard told 48 Hours. '…that motive involved Juliana's father breaking off business negotiation with him just days before Juliana's murder.' The reknowned surgeon was known to own property across the world including at least one Beverly Hills home and a horse farm. Prior . to the Maxim cover girl’s murder, Uwaydah attempted to go into business . with Miss Redding's father, Greg, an Arizona pharmacist. However, . Greg Redding began his own background check into the doctor and . discovered that Uwaydah was lying about his age, was married and had a . family. Acquitted: Kelly Soo Park had been accused on killing model Juliana Redding with her bare hands in March of 2008. The jury in her 2013 trial was unable to convict her . On learning of Uwaydah's history--and that he was and continues to be a married man--Juliana ended their affair and her father also stopped the business venture he planned with Uwaydah. Greg Redding sent Uwaydah a letter on March 10 ending their business relationship - five days before his daughter was killed. Prosecutors . said that Uwaydah made six-figure payments to Park and her family . before the killing and before Park's arrest. They said he had also . bragged that he had a 'female James Bond' ready to act. It . took two years to discover a suspect in the murder and investigators . linked Park through DNA evidence found on Redding's neck. Unproven: Prosecutors said Dr Munir . Uwaydah (left) had hired Kelly Soo Park (right) to kill Redding after a business deal with her father went sour. Now, Park works as a restaurant manager in Southern California and Uwaydah is living out his life in Beirut, Lebanon . It took seven days for the jury to come to their decision in Park’s case. It will take a lifetime for the Redding family and for Juliana’s friends to come to grips with the circumstances of her death. The family declined to comment much on the case to 48 Hours, and sent only a written statement in response to their interview requests: . ‘Our . family is deeply saddened and shocked…we believe the evidence against . the defendant is enormous and that justice has not been served.’","Juliana Redding, 21, was found brutally murdered in her Santa Monica home in 2008 .

Archaeologists trying to uncover the mystery of Stonehenge have been digging around the wrong hill for almost a century. Teams of archaeologists have spent the past 90 years scouring the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire to find the source of the prehistoric monument's iconic 'blue stones'. Scientists believed the 11 stones used to construct the ancient site came from a hill called Carn Menyn, but geologists have since discovered they actually came from another hill - just over a mile away - called Carn Goedog. Scientists believed the 11 'bluestones' used to build the outer ring of Stonehenge, pictured, came from Carn Menyn in the Presili Hills of Pembrokeshire, South Wales. However, new X-rays confirm they actually came from Carn Goedog, a hill situated just a mile away . A paper published by academic H.H Thomas in 1923 was the first to suggest the stones came from Pembrokeshire. The region of the Preseli Hills in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park is renowned for blue stones that resemble those used to build Stonehenge. Thomas claimed the particular dolerites that make up the ancient site came from a hill called Carn Menyn, and archaeologists have been digging on this location for the past 90 years in search of human activity. However, researchers from the National Museum of Wales, University College London and Aberyswyth University recently wanted to pinpoint the exact location. They X-rayed the 11 bluestones in Amesbury and discovered they more equally matched stones found on a hill called Carn Goedog - just a mile away from Carn Menyn. Now archaeologists plan to move to the new site. Now archaeologists . are planning to move to the new site. They . can then start trying to discover if prehistoric man cut the 11 stone monoliths . from the hill and transported them to the prehistoric site, or if they . were carried there by glaciers during the last Ice Age. Dr Richard Bevins from the National Museum of Wales is a leading . authority on volcanic rocks and has been studying the Preseli Hills since . he was a PhD student in the late 1970s. Working with Dr Rob Ixer of University . College London and Professor Nick Pearce of Aberystwyth University, Dr . Bevins used a paper published by academic H.H Thomas in 1923 as their . starting point. Thomas's paper was the first to put forward the theory that the blue stones of Stonehenge came from Pembrokeshire. In particular, it said they came from a Preseli Hill called Carn Menyn and ever since then archaeologists have assumed that to be the case. But Dr Bevins said: 'When Thomas was doing his research, it wasn't possible for him to be as precise as we can now. Dolerites found on the hill of Carn Goedog, pictured, match those used to build the ancient monument. However, it is still not known how the large stones travelled the 160 miles from South Wales to Amesbury, where Stonehenge was built .

It claimed the particular dolerites that make up the ancient site came from a hill called Carn Menyn, pictured, and archaeologists have been digging on this incorrect location for the past 90 years in search of human activity . 'By . X-raying dolerites from Stonehenge and comparing them with dolerites . from Carn Goedog, we know with some degree of certainty that is where . the blue stones originated. 'This is an incredibly exciting project and we got confirmation last week that our findings have been verified,' continued Dr Bevins. 'Getting such positive feedback was a great relief. 'After this, I don't expect to be . getting Christmas cards from the archaeologists who have been excavating . at the wrong place over all these years!' Stonehenge was built and altered over a period of about 1,000 years, starting around 2,600 BC.There are two types of stones at Stonehenge - the larger sarsens and the smaller outer rings of blue stones. Scientists initially thought the blue stones came from Carn Menyn in Pembrokeshire yet X-rays have revealed they came from Carn Goedog just a mile away.

The bluestones come from the Preseli Hills of Pembrokeshire but how the stones were transported over 160 miles to Stonehenge remains a mystery. Dr Bevins said there were competing theories but now archaeologists could finally solve the mystery now they've uncovered the stones' precise source. He said: 'Some have suggested they were transported by humans south to Milford Haven, put on boats and taken by sea to a point from which they were carried to Salisbury Plain.

Dr Richard Bevins from the National Museum of Wales is a leading authority on volcanic rocks and has been studying the Preseli Hills since he was a PhD student in the late 1970s . 'Others have suggested they may have been transported naturally by rock movements during the last Ice Age. It's not for me to say which of the theories is correct. 'If humans were involved in taking the stones, there should be some evidence of human activity at the site. But if they were transported during the last Ice Age, physical evidence should be present. 'We are publishing our findings and it will be for specialist archaeologists to use their expertise to excavate the site and see what physical evidence they can find.' Dr Bevins and the team of geologists will have their peer-reviewed paper published by the Journal of Archaological Science next year.","Stonehenge's outer ring is made up of 11 large dolerites called blue stones .

Back to school season is an expensive time for parents, with many paying up to £350 for their children’s uniform, according to new research. The study asked parents with two children about the cost of kitting out their kids for the new academic year. According to respondents, every year parents have to replace jumpers, polo shirts, trousers and school shoes, adding up to about £189 per child. So FEMAIL has put together a list of supermarkets - including Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's - in which you can kit the kids out to go back to school for almost half that: £98.49. Some parents invest in pricier items and spend up to £200 in the hope that they will last longer . The all-important winter coat was considered another pricey buy, often averaging at £30 for a decent high street purchase, with sports kits coming to a total of £20. Other items including pencil cases, stationery and school bags contributed to the cost averaging at a total of £25. For those parents with children at secondary school, extra costs came for blazers, ties and collared shirts. When asked about the general pricing of uniform, over half, 53 per cent of parents, said that it was expensive but something they had to buy. They also said they could budget for it as they knew that expense would be coming around every August and September. Parents say kids demand a new pencil case and stationery each year . One respondent said: 'I always know September is going to be an expensive month when my boys go back to school. 'The summer holidays is only six weeks long but they seem to grow so much in that time meaning everything needs to be replaced. 'On the uniform alone I usually end up spending about £200, I do tend to buy more expensive things with the hope that they’ll last longer.' Another woman involved in the study commented: 'Buying a school uniform is just one of those things you can’t avoid. 'The uniform isn’t so bad because kids do grow out of them, but I get frustrated when my children demand a new pencil case and stationery each year. I have no idea what happens to them.' A spokesperson for NetVoucherCodes.co.uk, who conducted the research, said: 'A lot of parents dread doing the uniform shop which is understandable because it is very expensive these days, but there are ways to keep the costs down.

Energy companies are making £53 profit from every customer on the back of spiralling prices and a long cold winter. Industry . regulator Ofgem said the amount has soared by an astonishing 76 per . cent in a year – from an average of £30 in 2011 to the £53 figure for . 2012. The details are . included in an  official study which also shows that profits from . supplying households are up five-fold since 2009 – rising from . £221million to £1.19billion. Gas and electricity bills for every home and business now make even more profit for energy firms . Profits on the average bill have risen from £8 in 2009 to £53 in 2012, fuelled by a bitterly cold winter . The . increase will infuriate  customers who are struggling to keep warm and . cover the cost of other essentials such as food and transport. Figures published today are expected to show that thousands of elderly died last winter from conditions exacerbated by the cold. At . the same time, the screw is being tightened further as the ‘big six’ energy firms are in the midst of a new round of price hikes. British . Gas, the biggest supplier, has just increased its tariffs by 10.4 per . cent for electricity and 8.4 per cent on gas – adding around £123 a year . to bills. Ofgem said the . company’s profit margin was some 6.6 per cent in 2012, which was the . highest of the big suppliers and ahead of the 5 per cent claimed by . executives.  Looking at the supply of gas to households alone, its . profit margin was 11.2 per cent, while the figure for its rival SSE was . higher still at 11.4 per cent. Audrey . Gallacher, director of energy pressure group Consumer Futures, said: . ‘The increase in supplier profits contrasts with declining . affordability. The sector is riding out tough economic times better than . its customers. ‘Energy . costs remain a concern for households, and are set to rise further with . the costs to make energy supply greener and more secure. Profits made from every domestic customer soared in just a year to £53, energy watchdog Ofgem said . ‘Fuel . poverty levels in the UK are extremely high. The Government’s Fuel . Poverty Advisory Group estimates there are now at least 6.5million . households affected. ‘More needs to be done to help consumers, ideally with a robust and well-targeted energy efficiency programme.’ The . Ofgem figures show that the average percentage profit margin per . household customer rose from 2.8 per cent in 2011 to 4.3 per cent in . 2012. The big energy . companies insist these figures are reasonable and relatively small when . set against the margins made by some other businesses, such as . supermarkets. Ofgem released this graph showing average profit margins from 2009 to 2012 for all parts of the supply businesses of the Big Six . However, . Ofgem revealed that the profit margins made by these same companies on . the electricity and gas they both generate and supply is a whopping 20 . per cent, which is high by most standards. Adding . the money made from generation to the total for selling power to the . public, total profits for the big six suppliers last year were . £3.7billion. The major . energy firms – British Gas, SSE, Npower, Eon, EDF and Scottish Power – . claim recent rises in bills are the result of an increase in wholesale . energy costs and the Government’s green taxes. Total profit margins varied markedly between the companies for supplying gas and electricity to homes and businesses in 2012 . However, . the Ofgem figures show that the increased profit margins has also hit . customers in the pocket during what is already a crippling cost of . living squeeze. An . independent study commissioned by Ofgem concludes that the wholesale . cost of energy did rise in 2012, while the firms also faced bigger bills . to access the national grid of pipes and cables. However, . it said: ‘The profit margin that suppliers on average earned from each . consumer also increased, from £30 in 2011 to £53 in 2012. There is some . evidence of rising profit margins. This rise has been due to a . combination of higher prices and volumes rather than lower costs.’ Campaigners are due to hold protests over rising bills at the offices of British Gas and Npower today. The biggest driver of increases in bills was rising wholesale costs, adding £75 to the average customer . James Grainger, of Fuel Poverty Action, said: ‘The big six are lying to us when they say the problem is “green taxes”. ‘The real problems are the big six’s profiteering and the rising cost of polluting energy like oil  and gas.’ Energy . UK, which speaks for suppliers, said the Ofgem figures were misleading . and failed to take account of the billions of pounds being spent on . developing new power stations and wind farms. It . said: ‘The main reasons customers have seen their household bills go up . is because the cost of gas and electricity have gone up as well as . other add-ons, such as the social and environmental policies, rising . fast.’ Rising costs: Households have seen their energy bills surge over the past decade . If you have never switched . suppliers, or haven't switched for an extended period of time, then now . is the time to do it. Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online . tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. But suppliers tend to charge . more for electricity to those customers who live in their 'home' region - . the areas where they enjoyed a monopoly before energy deregulation. So . switching away will almost always save you money. Prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for . you will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the . tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price. The . simplest and often best way to switch energy bills is to use an online . service, which can compare the tariffs on offer for you.

The extra from The Only Way is Essex spent weeks in hospital before flying back to the UK for reconstructive surgery. It is still unknown whether he slipped off the hotel balcony or was pushed. There are now calls for warnings to be put up at the airport for tourists arriving to be made aware of the high incidence of balcony falls. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Our message to everyone is to behave responsibly when they are staying somewhere that has a balcony. 'Most incidents involve young people between the ages of 18 and 35 and whilst not always the case, alcohol often plays a part.'

Local delicacy: Grasshoppers, which are already commonly eaten in Mexico, will provide the base for the first batches of Power Flour . Scientists have begun work to develop a protein rich flour, called Power Flour, which is made from insects and could feed millions in malnourished populations. Students from McGill University in Montreal were awarded the $1 million dollar Hult Prize to help with the production of the sustainable food staple which can produced and consumed in poor countries. Initially the team plan to recruit farmers to work on production in Mexico, where around 4 million people live in poverty and their is widespread malnutrition. The first batches of the flour will be made from grasshoppers, which are already common fare in the North American nation. Mohammed Ashour is the leader of the McGill team who pioneered what could be a revolutionary food stuff for the developing world. Speaking to ABC news, he said: 'It's a huge deal because we had a very ambitious but highly executable five-year plan in place. 'So winning this prize is a great step in that direction.' Ashour worked along with teammates Shobhita Soor, Jesse Pearlstein, Zev Thompson and Gabe Mott. They are now setting up an advisory board to oversee the first stages of Power Flour production. Speaking of their decision to begin with the humble grasshopper, Ashour explained the importance of using insects which are already familiar in the local diet. He said farmers have already expressed interest in raising grasshoppers on a mass level. The project is expected to be popular in areas of the world where insects are already a palatable food source. In many nations outside the western world they are already considered an important source of protein. And the type of insect used in each nation can vary depending on local eating habits. People of Ghana, for example, prefer palm weevils whereas in Botswana caterpillars are popular. The . committed scientists who developed the product  said they have consumed . kilos of the creepy crawlies as part of their research. Staple: The bugs will be used to produce a flour that is 'rich in protein' Foodstuff: Insects have already made their way into some western dishes, such as this Grasshopper plate from Wahaca, but scientists they can be used for good in poor malnourished populations . Ashour said: 'Shobhita was recently researching in Thailand and tried everything from worms to water beetles' Even Mott, who is a vegetarian member of the team, consumed his fair share of basil-flavored palm weevil. Ashour said: 'He's a vegetarian for ethical and ecological reasons, and when he looked at insects, for him it was really not an issue as far as being a source of protein that is ecologically balanced'","Scientists scoop prize for developing protein rich 'Power Flour'

A panel was shown pictures of celebrities like Paxman, Prince William, David Beckham Jude Law, George Clooney and Brad Pitt with and without a beard. On average, the panel said the stars looked five years older – and sometimes as much as eight years older - when they had a beard. The research also showed that the longer the beard, the more years it puts on a man. The only stars whose beards were said to have made them look younger were Hollywood actors Ben Affleck and Hugh Jackman. Prince William's real age is 31 - but when the panel was shown a picture of the royal with a beard, they believed he looked 36. David Beckham is 38 but he was aged at 34 by the panel when he was clean-shaven and 39 with a beard. The panel also said that Jude Law looked his real age - 40 - when clean shaven but three years old when he sported a beard. Baby face: Prince William's real age is 31 - but when the panel was shown a picture of the royal with a beard, they believed he looked 36 . Not so fresh faced: David Beckham, 38, was aged at 34 by the panel when he was clean-shaven and 39 with a beard . And as for George Clooney, he may be 52 but the panel said he looked his age with a beard yet 47 when shaved. Only Hugh Jackman and Ben Affleck . were said to look younger with beards - possibly because they almost . always wear their beards short or as heavy stubble, or because there is no grey in their beards.

John Daly has been sober since 2010, but that hasn't curtailed his exuberant sense of fun - as he proved on Sunday night when he teed-off a golf ball sitting on a tee placed in between a man’s teeth. Video posted online of the incredible feat of accuracy and skill shows the former wild-man of golf lining up the shot in the parking lot of Soulshine Pizza Factory in Nashville.

'I walked up and I thought some dude got knocked out because he was lying on the ground. We got a little closer and saw that he had a golf tee in his mouth,' Pearce Harrison, who shared video of the stunt on Instagram, told the New York Daily News. 'He was kind of fumbling around with it for a good three or four minutes, trying to decide if he wanted to do it or not.' Harrison said that he was visiting the Soulshine Pizza Factory when the crowd gathered round Daly caused him to check out what was going on.

"By . Alex Greig . PUBLISHED: . 09:15 EST, 22 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:02 EST, 22 November 2013 . A psychology professor has been taken into custody for the murder 18 years ago of her alleged rapist after rejecting a plea deal that would have handed her a three-year prison sentence. Norma Patricia Esparza, 39, is one of four suspects to face charges for the 1995 killing of Gonzalo Ramirez, 24, whose body was found hacked to death with a meat cleaver on the side of a road in Orange County. A fourth suspect died in July. Esparza, a professor at Webster University in Geneva, Switzerland, was arrested in the cold case murder late last year after re-entering the U.S. for an academic conference. Accused: Norma Patricia Esparza listens during a news conference in Santa Ana, California, on Wednesday . Esparza, a wife and the mother of a four-year-old daughter, said at a news conference Wednesday that she could not accept the plea deal, as it would be 'a lie.' 'The principle of what they're asking me is to plead guilty to something that they know I am not responsible for,' she said. She will now face trial for one felony count of special circumstance murder - a charge that can carry a life sentence without parole. Prosecutors are calling the murder of Gonzalo Ramirez a 'revenge killing.' They allege that on 15 April, 1995, a 20-year-old Esparza was at a bar with a gourp of friends, including former boyfriend Gianni Van, when she pointed out Ramirez, claiming he had raped her in her dorm room at Pomona College a few months earlier. According to the prosecution, Esparza, Van, Kody Tran, Diane Tran and Shannon Gries followed Ramirez when he left the bar in the early hours of the following morning. Accused: Ex-husband of Norma Patricia Esparza, Gianni Van (left), and Shannon Gries (right) Involved: Diane Tran (left) has plead not guilty in the crime, and Kody Tran (right) would have been charged had he not shot himself in a standoff with police last year . They intentionally rear-ended his vehicle, say prosecutors, forcing him to get out of the car to inspect the damage. He was then kidnapped. His body was found on the side of Sand Canyon Road in Santa Ana hours later. Esparza says she was forced by the aggressive Van to identify Ramirez and then coerced to keep the secret of his murder for almost two decades. Diane Tran, Shannon Gries and Gianni Van have also been charged. All have pleaded not guilty. Kody Tran died after shooting himself in a  standoff with police last year. According to the Los Angeles Times, Esparza says she met Ramirez in a Santa Ana nightclub. The next morning he asked her to breakfast and offered to drive her and some friends back to Pomona College. Wife and mother: Norma Patricia Esparza receives a hug from her four-year-old daughter, Arianna . Once in her dorm room, he raped Esparza, who went to a school nurse and was given the morning-after pill. She was too ashamed to report the rape to authorities and the nurse did not advise her to do so. 'I don't think I was thinking at that time,' she said. 'I felt ashamed. I felt guilty. I didn't want to come forward because I didn't want my family to know.' Julie Ann Rojas, who was Gries then-girlfriend, testified that she was with Van and Esparza the night Ramirez died. She said Van, Gries and Kody Tran attacked Ramirez while she and Esparza went to a bar. After about an hour Roja and Esparza went to the transmission shop owned by Kody Tran where Esparza said she saw Ramirez tied and hanging from the ceiling. Jailed: Norma Patricia Esparza, pictured with her husband, Jorge Mancillas, has been taken into custody . After Ramirez's death, Esparza began dating Van again and the two were married. Esparza's current husband Jorge R. Mancillas told reporters that Esparza was pressured into marrying Van so that she would not be bound to testify against him. Cold case: When investigators learned Esparza and Van were divorced, they re-opened the murder case of Gonzalo Ramirez . He said that his wife was told that Ramirez was 'roughed up' and was unaware of the murder until weeks later when she was questioned by police. Esparza, who says she suffered years of sexual abuse by her father as a child, said at a news conference Wednesday that she lived in fear of Van for years after the attack. 'All I knew is that I wanted to survive,' she said. 'All I knew was that these people were dangerous and I just needed to stay quiet and withdraw and come out of that night alive.' Senior deputy district attorney Scott Simmons said there is sufficient evidence 'to prove she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.' Mancillas and Esparza's four-year-old daughter Arianna were in the courtroom yesterday as she was handcuffed. The family lives in a small town in France on the Swiss border and Esparza is an assistant professor of psychology and counseling at Webster University. She will return to court on December 23.","Norma Patricia Esparza, 39, has been taken into custody for the murder of Gonzalo Ramirez in 1995 .
