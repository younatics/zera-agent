"You could be forgiven for thinking that celebrity chef Pete Evans would live in a sleek and modern luxury house, but the Paleo guru appears to have bought himself a sprawling rural property out in tiny town. Nestled in the heart of the Northern Rivers region of NSW, the homely 10-hectare property on Kanes Road, Round Mountain, was secretly snapped up by Evans in December. Property records indicate that the $1.2million sale went through on behalf of P.Evans Property Ltd, a company linked to Peter Daryl Evans. The 10-hectare property on Kanes Road, Round Mountain, was secretly snapped up by Evans in December . News Corp reported that the sale included three separate living areas- a three-bedroom residence, a converted barn with three bedrooms, and a converted shed with two bedrooms. The main residence also boasts two bedrooms and living rooms, as well as a timber kitchen with tiled floors, stained-glass cupboards and an island. The spacious living area opens to the backyard, and offers plenty of room for entertaining. The house also features a spacious outdoor entertaining area, leading down to three dams on the property. The American-style barn has been converted to three bedrooms, featuring a wide open space for chairs and tables, offering a spectacular panoramic view of the property. The barn has exposed beams in the ceiling, as well as a private, in-built bar. The converted shed now operates independently as a granny flat. Evans was encouraged to take on the Paleo lifestyle by his fiancee Nicola Robinson, a former glamour model . Property records indicate that the $1.2million sale went through on behalf of P.Evans Property Ltd . The main residence boasts  a timber kitchen with tiled floors, stained-glass cupboards and an island . A two-car open garage sits on the generously spaced property, surrounded by country pastures and other farms. In 2009, Evans was living in a property in Bondi Beach, which comprised two adjoining apartments, reported The Daily Telegraph. While his restaurants feature sleek interiors and minimalist presentation, this sprawling property is no-fuss or frills. The house appears to be in character for the outspoken media personality and My Kitchen Rules judge, who has commented in the past about his love of organic food, including 'activated' almonds. Evans, a proponent of the controversial Paleo Diet, may be looking to start his own hobby farm to grow his own organic produce. The property was advertised as 'usable acreage', and has the potential to support the kind of lifestyle Evans promotes through his books and education programs. Evans' book 'The Paleo Chef' was a hit within Australia, supporting the regime known as the Paleolithic Diet, the Caveman diet and the Stone Age Diet, which involves no processed foods, no sugar, no dairy, no grains, and no legumes. The spacious living area opens to the backyard, and offers plenty of room for entertaining . The American-style barn has been converted to three bedrooms, featuring a wide open space for entertaining . The house appears to be in character for the outspoken media personality and My Kitchen Rules judge . ‘It’s about sourcing the most natural, locally-sourced ingredients possible, combining moderate amounts of protein with good-quality,’ Evans told Daily Mail Australia in January. Evans was encouraged to take on the Paleo lifestyle by his fiancee Nicola Robinson, a former glamour model. 'I can remember Nic was sitting next to me reading [Primal Body, Primal Mind by Nora Gedgaudas] one night and I felt a sudden jab in my ribs,' he writes in his own book Going Paleo. 'She had this look in her eye and I knew she had stumbled onto something powerful.' Nicola, who he calls his 'wife' in his latest book, started dating the father-of-two shortly after he announced his split from his wife of 11 years Astrid Ellinger in 2011. The converted shed now operates independently as a granny flat . The main residence also boasts two bedrooms and living rooms . ‘I also like to add in a side of fermented veg with most meals that I eat as it’s full of healthy lactic acid so really helps to aid with both digestion and allowing the body to absorb the maximum amount of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fatty acids from each meal.’ Evans has just launched an Australian-first online 10-week The Paleo Way program in a bid to help all Australians who want to activate the Paleo lifestyle. As the property also comes with three dams, Evans would be in a prime position to drink flouride-free water. Evans has been slammed for his anti-fluoride campaign in Western Australia, enraging medical professionals who have described his standpoint as misinformed and a potentially dangerous lifestyle choice. Evans proudly adorned a 'Fluoride Free WA' t-shirt on Facebook to promote the Perth-based lobby group's cause.

"Hoards of eager crowds have gathered in Afghanistan's capital to watch competitors face off in the country's brutal and bizarre national sport that was previously banned under Taliban regime. The fierce competition involves mounted players who drag a disembowelled and decapitated goat and throw it into a scoring circle. Buzkashi translates into 'goat pulling' in English, but a calf is sometimes used too as the flesh is more likely to withhold the constant pulling and tugging by the athletes. Afghan horsemen compete during a game of buzkashi, the country's national sport, which was banned under the Taliban regime . Very little is known about buzkashi in the rest of the world, but it gained popularity when it was featured in the Rambo film franchise . The goat carcass, which can weigh up to 160 pounds, can be soaked in water prior to the event to toughen it . Although rules can vary, the matches usually see horsemen aim to fight off other players to transport the animal into a circle drawn onto the ground. In contests in Kabul, referees oversee the game proceedings, played on a square layout measuring 1,300ft on each side. The animal, which can weigh up to 160 pounds, can be soaked in water prior to the event to toughen it, and players are not permitted to attach it to their saddles.

"Phillip Lemonheigh turned his car into a fake ambulance by using a flashing blue light and 'emergency response' stickers . A driver who turned his car into a fake ambulance by using a flashing blue light and 'emergency response' stickers was caught after speeding through a red traffic light. Phillip Lemonheigh disguised his wife's Renault Laguna estate car as an ambulance for three months before he was eventually caught. Lemonheigh, 59, was seen travelling at 73mph in a 50mph zone in Llantrisant, near Cardiff, as he ran errands for his bed-bound wife Noreen. He was arrested after being recorded running the light in the 'ambulance' almost 24 seconds after it had turned red. Despite not having a driving licence, Lemonheigh got behind the blue Renault as he ran errands for his wife who suffers from a 'chronic medical condition'. A judge at Swansea Crown Court told Lemonheigh - who arrived at court in a wheelchair - that he had 'never come across something so bizarre' in his entire career. The 59-year-old disguised the blue Renault Laguna estate car as a first response-style ambulance and then spent three months speeding in it and running traffic signals, the court heard. But his deception came to an end when he was caught by a speed camera on the A4119. Lemonheigh, who admits dangerous driving, will be sentenced next month because he suffered a heart attack in the days leading up to the hearing. He also perverting the course of justice after claiming he was a 'volunteer ambulance driver' at the time of the offence. Judge Peter Heywood said: 'I don't think I have ever come across something so bizarre, these clearly are very unusual offences to which you have pleaded guilty. 'As you know the court will be minded to consider a prison sentence and I will be asking for medical and psychological reports to be made.' Lemonheigh was caught travelling at 73mph through the red light as he ran errands for his wife in the Renault Laguna, seen with a blue, flashing light on the roof . The driver was caught by this speed camera in Llantrisant, near Cardiff, as he ran errands for his wife in the fake ambulance . The judge also imposed an 'interim disqualification' to stop Lemonheigh from driving ahead of his sentencing on March 20. Speaking after the court hearing, a laughing Lemonheigh admitted that he had been driving the fake ambulance for three months before 'going a bit far'. He said: 'I had the words emergency response stuck on the side, I paid a printer £18 to have them put on, I had the car like that for three months. 'I just went a bit far and they caught me. I don't think I was doing anything wrong. But each to their own.' Teresa Healy, operations manager at GoSafe - who are responsible for speed cameras around Wales - said: 'This case should be a lesson to everyone who is considering lying to the police. 'It is disappointing to find that people are still going to great and calculated lengths to avoid prosecution.'","Phillip Lemonheigh turned his Renault estate car into a fake ambulance .

"An alleged thief nicknamed the 'Gumball Bandit' may have had his bubble burst for good. Police nabbed suspect Jason Bietch, 39, of Scarsdale, New York, on Thursday whom they believe is responsible for stealing over 100 gumball machines from various establishments in the Bronx so that he could re-sell them to fuel a drug habit. The New York Post reports that Bietch was suspected on February 5 when he was spotted allegedly stealing two 75-pound gumball machines worth $350 each from a Wash & Dry in the Parkchester by the store's disgruntled owner. Scroll down for video . Sticky fingers: Jason Bietch is accused of stealing over 100 gumball machines from establishments in the Bronx in order to resell them so he could buy drugs . Surveillance: Suspect Jason Bietch can be spotted allegedly stealing this Gumball machine from a pizza shop . 'All of a sudden he grabbed the machine and started running,' said manager Ramon Rivera, 46, who chased the suspect to the street told The New York Daily News. 'He slipped on the ice and so I had enough time to see his license plate,' he said. 'It was GUM and four other numbers. I couldn’t believe it. It’s crazy his license plate said GUM.' Bietch was able to leave the Laundromat with the gumball machine but the owner didn't believe his lie that he worked for Great American Vending who refills the machine every month so he reported the theft to police. Surveillance video at a check cashing shop and a pizza place shows the sticky fingered alleged thief in action. When police spoke with the company Great American Vending the company informed them that 100 of their gumball machines had been lifted from stores around the area. Spotted again: Bietch is also caught on surveillance footage allegedly stealing machines from this check cashing store in New York . Bietch was caught at a probation meeting on Thursday and now faces charges related to grand and petite larceny. He is also accused of stealing a $1,500 candy dispenser from another Laundromat on Bainbridge Avenue in The Bronx. Police said they're unsure as to how much the 100 machines were worth but they believe Bietch was re-selling them in order to fuel his drug habit. The New York Post reports that Bietch was arrested twice in 2014, once for aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle and another time for possession of heroin. 'He’s not the brightest guy,' said a police officer. 'He thought they would be easy scores, but he didn't count on the cameras.' 'They wear a uniform, act like they come from a company,' said store owner Louie Cordero to ABC. 'He's hit small mom and pop stores. We're upset, with that money we pay the gas, the light,' Cordero said. Baffled: Store owner Louie told reporters, 'he's hit small mom and pop stores.

"Steven Dunks, 45, was told he must serve a minimum of 19 years behind bars after being convicted of the murder of Lynn Howarth in Oldham, Greater Manchester . A spurned lover who battered his ex-girlfriend to death in a jealous rage and then used her phone to pretend she was still alive was jailed for life today. Steven Dunks was told he would serve a minimum of 19 years behind bars for the brutal murder of former partner Lynn Howarth, 43. The jealous 45-year-old flew into a drunken rage and beat Miss Howarth to death after she started seeing another man. Just days before the killing he had issued a chilling warning to his former partner, telling her he would 'rather see her dead before seeing her with someone else.' After the murder he stole Miss Howarth's mobile sim and bank cards in a bid to cover up his crime and trick her family into believing she was still alive. Her decomposed body was discovered a month after the brutal killing when neighbours alerted police of a strong smell coming from the property. Manchester Crown Court heard the couple had a volatile on-and-off relationship for around 18 months. Miss Howarth told friends that she had split up with Dunks after learning that he was seeing another woman behind her back. In July last year the agoraphobic met a new man online and he became a regular visitor to her flat. The jury heard that a drunken Dunks appeared at her flat on July 18, to confront his ex and her new partner, saying he would 'rather see her dead before seeing her with someone else.' Just nine days after the threat he returned to the property for a second time and launched the violent attack. Miss Howarth's injuries were so severe that her jaw bone had become detached from the rest of her skull. Dunks then stole her phone sim  and bank card and spent the next month speaking to Miss Howarth's new partner and mother via Facebook and text messages in a bid to cover his tracks. Her body was discovered on August 26 - along with a blood-stained glove that was covered in Dunks' DNA.He was arrested the following day. Dunks of Oldham, Greater Manchester, had denied murder but  a jury disbelieved his version of events and found him guilty. Speaking after the sentence Detective Chief Inspector Richard Eales of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Dunks was quite happy to string along two women at the same time. 'But the thought of her moving on with her life and finding a new partner sent him into a terrible rage. 'He ended her life in one of the most violent ways I have seen as a detective. He used enough force to cause catastrophic damage to her head and face. 'He then left her body to rot in the home they had shared, taking her sim card and cash cards with him so he could steal her money and trick her friends and family into thinking she was still alive. 'Lynn was limited by her anxiety and fear of open spaces, she did not travel far from her flat and her social life was led mainly online and through mobile phone. 'Dunks knew that and that is why he thought to try and cover his tracks by using her Facebook account and mobile phone to contact the people who were going to be most worried about her. Miss Howarth's body was found at the flat she once shared with Dunks in Heywood, Rochdale, a month after her brutal murder . 'Think of what that have must have been like for her mother, thinking that she was exchanging text messages with her daughter when in reality she was communicating with the man who had brutally murdered Lynn weeks earlier. 'I hope this sentence can go some way to comforting Lynn's family during this tremendously difficult time.' Rob Hall, Senior Crown Advocate for CPS North West, said: 'Today, Steven Dunks has been jailed for a minimum of 19 years for committing a brutal murder. 'Lynn Howarth had recently ended the relationship with him and was beginning to move on with her life. 'However Dunks became jealous and controlling, ultimately threatening that he would rather see her dead than see her with anyone else. 'He savagely beat her to death inside her own flat and then left her body in situ whilst he withdrew cash from her bank account and used her Blackberry mobile phone to look at pornographic websites. 'To maintain the impression that Lynn Howarth was still alive he pretended to be Lynn and engaged in an unpleasant text conversation on her Blackberry with her mother. 'Throughout the case Steven Dunks has denied he was responsible for the murder, but after the jury have carefully considered all the evidence, they have found him unanimously guilty of the murder. 'He must now face the consequences of his actions as he begins this prison sentence.'","Steven Dunks, 45, convicted of the murder of ex lover Lynn Howarth .

"Belgian doctor Wim Distelmans . A controversial doctor who practises euthanasia has sparked outrage by organising a tour to Auschwitz because he says the Nazi death camp is ‘inspiring’. Belgian doctor Wim Distelmans, who has been dubbed ‘Dr Death’ for administering lethal injections, claims the visit will ‘clarify confusion’ about dying as well as addressing the issue of euthanasia. But Jewish and anti-euthanasia campaigners have reacted with horror, saying the trip, billed as a study tour, is ‘offensive and shocking’. Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman said: ‘To make the notorious Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz the centre for a congenial study-trip is preposterous, if not obscene. ‘Whatever one’s views on euthanasia – and I am against – it is abominable to describe Auschwitz as an “inspiring venue”. What went on at Auschwitz and the other death-camps was mass murder of innocents – children, women and men.’ Dr Distelmans, who co-ordinates legalised killings from his Brussels clinic, has circulated a brochure advertising the three-day tour for a cost of £470, including visits to the Auschwitz gas chambers and a ‘seminar’ on issues including euthanasia, which is legal in Belgium. He said in the leaflet that Auschwitz, in Poland, where a million  people were put to death, was ‘the pre-eminent symbol of a degrading end of life’. He added: ‘This site is an inspiring venue for organising a seminar and reflecting on these issues so that we can consider and clarify confusions.’ The row coincides with controversy over attempts by the Labour peer and former Chancellor Lord Falconer to legalise assisted suicide in Britain, which critics say could prove a ‘slippery slope’ towards widespread killing of the sick. Under Lord Falconer’s Bill, which receives its second reading in the Lords on Friday, doctors would be able to prescribe terminally ill patients a lethal dose of drugs, but the patient would have to take the drugs themselves. Belgium has gone a step further by allowing doctors to legally administer a fatal dose. Dr Distelmans, 60, gained notoriety after he was shown on TV ending the life of Nathan  Verhelst, 44, a transsexual who asked to die after doctors botched his sex change surgery. Last year, he performed the world’s first double euthanasia for deaf twin brothers Marc and Eddy Verbessem, 45, after they learned that they were going blind. According to a leaflet advertising the tour, the visit to Auschwitz will take place on October 9, and will include a ‘scientific programme’, details of which are not yet finalised. It says they will be accompanied by documentary maker Lydia Chagoll, who was imprisoned in  a Japanese camp during the  Second World War, and participate in a ‘symposium’. However, a spokesman for Auschwitz said the group was only booked in for a routine tour led by official guides who will relate the history of the camp and show them the key areas including the gas chambers. Wim Distelmans, who has been dubbed 'Dr Death' for administering lethal injections, claims the visit to Auschwitz (above) will 'clarify confusion' about dying as well as addressing the issue of euthanasia . The group will also visit Birkenau to see where Jews were herded off the transportation trains and selected to go straight to the gas chamber or to become prisoners. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the son of Polish Jewish immigrants, said: ‘This is shocking. It will cause offence to a lot of people throughout Europe, whichever side of the argument they are on. I am all in favour of people going to Auschwitz to find out the oppression that happened there, but to describe it as an inspiring setting suggests he is either mad, stupid or incompetent.’ Anti-euthanasia campaigner Baroness Grey-Thompson, the British Paralympian, said: ‘To describe Auschwitz as “inspiring” is very upsetting and very disturbing. It  is appalling.’ Dr Distelmans was unavailable for comment yesterday, but he earlier told the Jewish Chronicle he had been shocked by criticisms. He was quoted as saying: ‘Firstly, this is not a symposium about euthanasia. It’s a study trip focusing on human rights, suffering and  palliative care. We will mention euthanasia, but that is not the main goal of the trip. ‘The participants are all professionals working in palliative care. They work every day with patients who suffer pain and death. ‘Our main goal is to visit the death camp where all these atrocities  took place. ‘Secondly, many of the participants were not in favour of a law on euthanasia, but changed their mind after the law came into action. ‘There is obviously no link between euthanasia in Belgium and what happened in Auschwitz. ‘The Nazis used the term “euthanasia” wrongly.’","Belgian doctor Wim Distelmans has organised a 'study tour' to Auschwitz .

"A killer superbug which claimed the lives of two patients in a Los Angeles hospital has been linked to a surgical tool used on more than 500,000 patients a year. At least seven people have contracted the antibiotic resistant bacteria while undergoing endoscopic procedures at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center between October and January. Medics fear that more than 170 patients may have been put at risk having been treated with the suspect piece of equipment. Scroll down for video . Dr Robert Cherry, pictured, confirmed that two endoscopes at the hospital had been infected with the bug . The infected patients were treated using a contaminated endoscope which transmitted the bacteria, file photo . Dr Robert Cherry, the hospital's chief medical quality officer, confirmed that two endoscopes that were used to diagnose and treat patients with pancreatic and bile-duct problems here contaminated with 'embedded' infections. Five other endoscopes were found to be clear. Worryingly, the two infected endoscopes had been cleaned according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dr Cherry said that a more stringent sterilisation technique had been introduced following the fatal outbreak. Dr Benjamin Schwartz, deputy director of acute communicable disease control and prevention for the LA County Department of Public Health said: 'This outbreak is not a threat to public health.' Scientists have confirmed the infection is a carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE. The bug was found on the endoscope which is inserted down a patient's throat to allow a doctor to examine internal organs without the need for major surgery. The infection has been linked back to a 'source case' patient responsible for the outbreak. Medics only discovered the problem in mid December after a patient, who had just undergone an endoscopic procedure developed an infection which could not be treated with antibiotics. Attorney Kevin Boyle said Thursday that one of his clients, an 18-year-old student, was among those infected after he entered the hospital for a procedure that involved using an endoscope to examine his pancreas. The patients were infected with the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae bacteria, artist's impression . One of those infected by the superbug is an 18-year-old student who has spent 83 days in hospital . Mr Boyle said: 'After he had the procedure he was released. Then he came down with his illness, and when they studied him and noticed he had the CRE bacteria in him they quickly put two and two together. Mr Boyle declined to release the teenager's name or say where he attends school but said he spent 83 days in the hospital at one point and was released but recently relapsed and is currently hospitalised. He said the family doesn't blame UCLA but is considering suing the endoscope's manufacturer. Dr Deverick Anderson, infectious-disease expert at Duke University said: 'You can very easily do everything right and still have some contamination . 'We're finding this is a problem, but it's probably one that we don't have a very good solution to right now.' The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday issued an advisory warning doctors that even when a manufacturer's cleaning instructions are followed, germs may linger. The device's complex design and tiny parts make complete disinfection extremely difficult, the advisory said. Between January 2013 and December 2014, the FDA received 75 reports involving 135 patients in the U.S. who may have been infected by tainted scopes. In a statement, the FDA said it is trying to determine what more can be done to reduce such infections. But it said that pulling the device from the market would deprive hundreds of thousands of patients of 'this beneficial and often life-saving procedure.' 'The FDA believes at this time that the continued availability of these devices is in the best interest of the public health,' the agency said. The bacteria can cause infections of the bladder or lungs, leading to coughing, fever or chills. CRE infections have been reported in every state except Idaho, Alaska and Maine, according to the CDC . Similar outbreaks of Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been reported around the nation. They are difficult to treat because some varieties are resistant to most known antibiotics .","Two patients have died after being infected with a superbug in LA .

"After a week of live episodes to celebrate the 30th anniversary of EastEnders, the 'Who Killed Lucy?' storyline came to an emotional end. Bobby Beale was revealed as the killer on Thursday night, though Jane tried to take the blame for her murder when finally confronted by Ian. But the tearful father realised his new wife was protecting his youngest son, and decided to protect their murderous secret anyway - as Bobby doesn't even realise he killed his sister. Tragic truth: Ian Beale discovers his son Bobby killed Lucy in the finale of the EastEnders live week . Show boss Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: 'He thinks she got up and walked out the door, and that is what Jane has said to him.' The producer said he initially had two other suspects in mind for the murder before deciding to put Bobby in the frame and added the idea had been partly inspired by the murder mystery novels of Agatha Christie. He said: 'Three of Agatha Christie's best ones - one of them the detective did it, one of them everyone did it and one of them the narrator of the story did it. We always wanted those big twists.' He said it was a conscious decision not to show the fight between the two characters to protect the young actor, Eliot Carrington, who plays Bobby. Treadwell-Collins said: 'The fact Bobby didn't deliberately do it and it was an accident is very, very important. I wouldn't lumber a child with that.' The episode opened with Jane (Laurie Brett) and Ian (Adam Woodyatt)  in the kitchen where he reveals how he knew Jane was hiding something. 'When you stayed calm after Peter wanted to confront Denise. Everyone else was panicking but you stayed calm,' Ian tells her when she asks how he knew something was amiss. 'My little girl out on the common was it you? Are you covering for someone?' 'It was just me, only me,' Jane says before Ian flies into a rage and kicks her out of the kitchen. Protection: Ian will not go to the police about his son and Jane's murderous secret . Peter (Ben Hardy) finds his dad in their trashed kitchen, and eventually a crying Ian tells him Jane's revelation. Jane then makes up a story of how she killed Lucy: 'It was a freak thing, the wrong angle, the wrong part of her head. I should have phoned the police. I didn't and I panicked.' But Ian isn't convinced when Jane says she confessed to Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton), who died from the injuries sustained after being hit by Roxie Mitchell's car. 'Why didn't Emma report it. She finally solves the case and does nothing to solve it,' Ian says. 'What aren't you telling me?' Final words: Ian kissed the last letter of love written by Lucy on the night she died . Then it dawns on him: 'He called his mum. He did something bad and he phoned you for help.' 'The door was open, she was lying there,' Jane cries, 'I thought it was joke. I checked her breathing, there was nothing. He said she started it, but he didn't seem to know she was dead. He hit her with a box.' 'The jewellery box, he gave that to Beth for Christmas,' Cindy Williams (Mimi Keene) says shocked. 'He's a 10-year old boy, why did he do such a thing,' Ian laments. Apology: Lucy's letter was away of saying sorry for the trouble she had caused her father . 'He said he heard the arguing that night, he couldn't sleep. He said she was writing something, he wanted her to stop causing trouble. He picked up the box, she fell, he couldn't wake her, he said he tried all on his own and that's when he called me,' Jane cries. Peter still didn't understand why Jane tried to cover it up and Jane continues to play the loving mother card to justify her actions to protect her son. Ian runs out the room to be sick when he hears that his wife put her into the boot of the car and carried her 'like a child' into the woods before laying her down and crying her sorrys to her dead step-daughter. Maternal instinct: Jane said she wanted to protect her son that's why she disposed of Lucy's body in Walford Common . She continues to try and justify Bobby's actions: 'He was frustrated, he just wanted to make things better.' Then Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) turns up to tell Ian about his mother Kathy (Gillian Taylforth) actually being alive but the distraught father frantically tells him to leave. 'Is everything alright?' Bobby says as he arrives home, unaware that he even killed Lucy with his actions. Can't believe it: Peter doesn't want to continue the lie after finding out the truth about his twin sister's death . 'If the truth comes out we're all going to get the blame,' Peter says. Jane and Cindy both say they should keep quiet, while Ian goes up to speak to his son. Beale than tells Peter that they must continue to cover up the murder. 'I won't be part of it,' Peter says. 'Nine hours she was laying there in the cold. The only people you care about is Jane and Bobby.' 'She treated her like a sack of rubbish,' Peter screams and tells Ian 'he'll never forgive him'. Angry: Peter gets aggressive with Jane as she tries to persuade the family to keep the secret . Peter runs out the house leaving Jane and Ian to reconcile over their decision to not got to the police with the truth. Bobby also hands Cindy the final note written by Lucy which Jane referred to in her confession. Too upset to read it, Cindy takes it upon herself to recite the final words. 'Dear Dad I'm sorry for what I said earlier. i didn't mean it, i'm a wreck but i'm going to change starting tonight,' she says. The omen: Ian speaks to Bobby, who doesn't actually know that he killed Lucy . 'Look at me home before midnight and the drugs are gone. When you get home look in on me I'll be sleeping. 'But wake me up I want to tell you how much you mean to me and how much I love you don't forget dad wake me up, Lucy Lou.' Ian breaks down in tears as he kissed the final words of his dead daughter. He then turns to Bobby, 'You didn't do anything wrong.' Meanwhile, rapist Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) appeared to be lying dead in the Queen Vic's beer room after landlord Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) attacked him, and his daughter Nancy (Maddy Hill) wants to go to the police. Sticking together: Jane and Ian put on a united front for the sake of their son . 'There's a body,' she tells the detective dealing with Nick Cotton's death. They think she's talking about the nasty villain not Dean and Mick quickly pulls her away. Inside the pub, Linda (Kellie Bright) asks him to marry her in front of everyone but he tells her 'not now' as Nancy drags him upstairs. 'What's a matter with me, course I'll marry ya,' he says turning back and snogging his partner. But as they return to the cellar, Dean's body is miraculously gone. Keep it quiet: Mick Carter gets his daughter Nancy to not go to the police about Dean Wick's lifeless body in the Queen Vic cellar . At the end of the episode, fireworks light up the Square to celebrate the Carters' engagement. 'You alright?' Mick asks Ian. 'We will be,' he replies, with Phil solemnly watching the pair before walking away himself. Since Lucy was found dead last April, the soap has seen alibis disproven, motives revealed, and suspects brought into the frame, including her father Ian. Gone: They discover his body has vanished from the cellar, with everyone else none the wiser to the incident . The mystery unravelled in this week's EastEnders Live Week, which saw more than one million extra viewers tune in. The 'Live Week' saw regular EastEnders' episodes, airing on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, interspersed with live scenes. Tonight's episode will be the only completely live episode of the week. More than 9.6million viewers - a two-year high for the BBC One soap - watched the show as it first went live on Tuesday. It means the episode attracted 1.5million more viewers than last Tuesday's episode. Tough night: Both Mick and Ian head out to the Square after a rather stressful evening . Viewing figures dipped for Wednesday's instalment but 8.9million people still tuned in. The high viewing figures will no doubt please the show's bosses, who chose to wait almost a year – until the soap's 30th anniversary – to bring the dramatic whodunnit to a close. An average of more than 10million people are thought to have tuned in last night to watch the conclusion to the long-standing storyline. Unaware: Phil Mitchell tried to tell Ian about his mum Kathy being alive but doesn't get a chance . And, as the killer was revealed to be schoolboy Bobby, fans were sent into a frenzy on Twitter with more 30,000 tweets alone sent in the single minute after the killer was revealed. Figures showed that more than one million tweets were sent in total during the two EastEnders' episodes which aired last night, making them the most tweeted-about episodes of a soap ever. The second episode eclipsed the 508,678 messages sent during the first special by more than 10,000, with 519,359 tweets posted as the killer came closer to being unmasked, data from social analytics firm Kantar Social TV UK showed.

"An alleged former-bikie boss arrested on charges of extortion, threatening violence and stalking has converted to Islam. A heavily-tattooed Brett Pechey, who goes by the name of Kaos, was arrested at Brisbane International Airport earlier this month after being forced to return to Australia due to a lack of funds after hiding in south east Asia since 2013. The 26-year-old, who is the alleged former-president of notorious West End Bandidos gang and who police are investigating possible links to Brothers 4 Life, is known by authorities to have embraced Islam, according to The Courier Mail. Scroll down for video . One of Queensland's most wanted bikies, Brett Pechey, 26, is understood to have converted to Islam . Mirways Sayed, the leader of Muslim organisation Ummah United which has been under scrutiny due to its alleged connections to bikie members and suicide bombers, voiced his support for Pechey following his arrest . His social media posts were accompanied by a picture of Pechey being arrested at Brisbane Airport . Mirways Sayed, the leader of Muslim organisation Ummah United which has been under scrutiny due to its alleged connections to bikie members and suicide bombers, voiced his support for Pechey following his arrest. Ummah United claims it does not support extremist views, but rather tries to help men keep away from jihad and crime . 'This is a true brother of mine. He loves peace loyalty respect honesty. Never hurt no [sic] body. May Allah help u brother we are here for u. Ummah united,' a post by Mr Sayed on social media read. An earlier post said: 'Brother pechey is back may allah make it eazy for him [sic]'. Ummah United claims it does not support extremist views, but rather tries to help men keep away from jihad and crime, according to the ABC. Pechey, who will remain in police custody until March 6, is facing charges of extortion, threatening violence, stalking, assault occasioning bodily harm in company, affray, breaking and entering while armed in company, rioting, breach of bail and a number of traffic offences, The Courier Mail reports. The alleged  former-president of notorious West End Bandidos gang was taken into custody after touching down at Brisbane International Airport earlier this month . Police are now investigating if the 26-year-old has possible links to notorious Brothers 4 Life gang . Video footage (pictured) showed Pechey to be one of the 'more significant players' in the Broadbeach incident in 2013, Det Insp Smith said . He spent more than a year living in Thailand - first Bangkok, then Phuket - after fleeing Australia following a violent bikie brawl at Broadbeach on the Gold Coast in Queensland in 2013. The alleged one-time bikie boss had been living off profits from a clothing business and funds channelled via friends and family in Australia. Pechey allegedly begged his grandmother for $25,000 when his funds ran out, but this was ignored on instruction from 'fed up' family members, forcing him to return to Australia, reported The Courier-Mail. Detective Inspector Brendan Smith said police had been pursuing extradition options when negotiations with Pechey led to him boarding a plane and handing himself in. While detectives are still investigating Pechey's links to Sydney's Brothers 4 Life gang, Det Insp Smith said he seemed chastened by his time on the run. 'He certainly hasn't got the bravado that they would normally have,' he said. 'He appears resigned to the fact things have changed.' He spent more than a year living in Thailand - first Bangkok, then Phuket - after fleeing Australia following a violent bikie brawl at Broadbeach in 2013 . Pechey is shown standing up to police during the 2013 Broadbeach brawl. He fled Australia soon after . Video footage showed Pechey to be one of the 'more significant players' in the Broadbeach incident, Det Insp Smith said. The other charges he's facing relate to a number of dawn raids conducted by police last March across Brisbane, Gold Coast and Logan. The raids netted nine patched Bandidos bikie gang members and led to members of the West End and Centro chapters being charged with extortion offences. Police claim they'd used standover tactics to intimidate victims, some cornered at gyms, into handing over money and property. One victim even required facial reconstruction surgery after suffering a broken nose, fractured eye socket and chipped teeth, while another was allegedly threatened with a hand gun and a baseball bat. Det Insp Smith said a number of criminal motorcycle gang members remain living overseas but are not currently wanted by police, saying: 'realistically, I hope they never come back'. Pechey allegedly begged his grandmother for $25,000 when his funds ran out, but this was ignored on instruction from 'fed up' family members, forcing him to return to Australia earlier this month .

"Philip Pickett has been jailed after luring pupils into sound-proof music rooms at Guildhall School of Music and Drama to sexually assault them . An eminent classical musician who taught at the Guildhall School of Music has been jailed for 11 years for sexually abusing pupils in soundproofed music rooms. Philip Pickett, one of Britain’s best recorder players and an internationally renowned expert on early music, used his fame to prey on two teenage schoolgirls and a 21-year-old woman whom he locked in practice rooms where no one could hear their screams. Police believe the 64-year-old may have attacked scores of women around the world as he toured with orchestras during a glittering career spanning four decades. It can be revealed that complaints were made about him to police in Milan in 1988, where he was accused of indecently assaulting a 26-year-old woman he performed with at a concert. Detectives believe there are other victims in other countries, who may have not have reported the assaults because of his influence at the world-leading conservatoire. The three-times married teacher was first reported to the principal of the school, where he taught music between 1972 and 1997, more than three decades ago. The mother of a 17-year-old wrote to the then head, John Hosier, in the 1980s saying her daughter had been molested in a locked windowless music room. But instead of Pickett being reported to police, the girl was told to find another school. Mr Hosier informed the mother that he had received no other complaints and took no further action, despite Pickett refusing to see his boss to discuss the allegations. The next year Guildhall awarded Pickett a fellowship, one of its highest honours, in recognition of his musical achievements. Pickett, described as a ‘social animal’, left the Guildhall in 1997 and went on to be artistic director of the Southbank Centre and director of early music at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre. The conductor was not reported to police until 2013, in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. He continued to deny the offences and demanded that his Old Bailey trial be delayed so he could continue to perform with folk musician Carlos Nunez and the New London Consort group which he founded. Martin Heslop, QC, defending, even tried to persuade the judge that his sentence should be delayed so he could attend music festivals in Bologna, Vienna and Manchester. But Judge Charles Wide refused and jailed him for 11 years after he was convicted of two rapes and two indecent assaults by a jury earlier this month. The case can now be reported after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to proceed with another trial relating to a girl who was allegedly sexually assaulted between the ages of 13 and 15 in the 1970s. The CPS also decided not to go ahead with an allegation of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on an ex-partner. All these remaining charges were left on file. Pickett was cleared of six other charges against four young women. The court heard how Pickett, 64, tried to delay sentencing after being convicted of sexual offences. The professional record player taught at Guildhall School of Music and Drama for 25 years . The teacher, who lives in a £500,000 cottage in Lyneham, near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, with his wife, a singer and harpsichord player, showed no remorse. At least one of his victims was so traumatised that she abandoned her dreams of a career in music. Sentencing him for the ‘terrible crimes’, Judge Wide said: ‘You were their teacher. To a degree, they were in awe of you, especially the schoolgirls. There is the location of the offences – in the practice rooms at the Guildhall School of Music. Soundproofed and dark – even if they had shouted they could not have been heard.’ One 16-year-old recorder player was assaulted on her first lesson after she won a place in the school’s sixth-form in 1978. Pickett told her she needed to work on her breathing and asked her to take her top off. He then told her to lie on the floor, turned out the lights and forced her to commit a sex act. During the second lesson Pickett raped her. She refused to go to any more lessons but did not tell her mother until ten years later. The court heard how Pickett would take vulnerable pupils into sound-proof rooms at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (above) to assault them . A 17-year-old recorder player was attacked during a lesson in the 1980s after Pickett told her he would show her how to breathe and turned off the lights. She told her mother, whose letter of complaint was rejected by the head. The third victim was a 21-year-old student. When she went to the Guildhall for private tuition he locked the door and raped her on the floor of a practice room. A police spokesman said: ‘Potentially there are significant amounts of victims out there. ‘I would urge these people to contact the City of London Police.’","Philip Pickett, 64, has been jailed over attacks between 1979 and 1983 .

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State today claimed responsibility for a series of suicide bombings that killed at least 45 people in a Libyan town under government control. The group said the attacks in Qubba were in retaliation for the killing of Muslims in the Islamic militant stronghold of Derna, around 20 miles away. Egyptian warplanes conducted multiple airstrikes in Derna after militants linked to the Islamic State group beheaded 21 Egyptian Christian hostages. The attack also targeted the forces of army General Khalifa Hifter, who has been leading an offensive against Islamic militias on behalf of the internationally recognised government. The group's statement said two of the 'Caliphate's knights' carried out suicide bombings targeting what they described as one of General Hifter's operations rooms. Scroll down for video . Three bombings (not pictured) struck a Libyan town near to the city of Darna (above), which is controlled by the Islamic State . According to Libyan army spokesman Mohammed Hegazi, a car bomb exploded next to a gas station in the town as motorists lined up to fill their tanks, killing at least 30. The explosion also wounded dozens of others. Hegazi added that the gas station was close to the town's security headquarters. A security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the gas station blast was only one in a string of attacks in Qubba on Friday. Procession: A fleet of cars parade freely through the Libyan city of Benghazi, showing the level of control they exercise in the country ruled almost entirely by rebel forces . Unrest: Libya has descended in to chaos in recent weeks as ISIS cements a foothold in the country . At least 10 people were killed when Islamic extremists targeted a hotel where Somali government officials were meeting. Mogadishu's deputy mayor and a legislator were said to be among those killed in the attack on the city's Central Hotel, which saw one extremist ram an explosives-laden vehicle into the hotel gate and another going inside and blowing himself up. The country's deputy prime minister was among the injured, a police official said. The attack is the latest blow to the Somali government's efforts to contain the deadly insurgency by the Al Qaeda-linked Al-Shabab group that, despite the loss of key strongholds in Somalia, continue to stage attacks in the capital and elsewhere. The Islamic insurgent group claimed responsibility for the twin suicide bombings, according to the group's radio station Andulus. He said one other attack targeted the home of Parliament Speaker Ageila Saleh, who represents the elected government, based in eastern Libya. A third attack targeted the security headquarters building itself, said the official, who also gave a different casualty figure, putting the total death toll at around 25. Such conflicting tolls are common in the aftermath of large attacks. Hospital officials and others in Qubba could not immediately be reached for comment. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which Hegazi said bore the hallmarks of Islamic militants who have battled the army for months in and around the eastern city of Benghazi. Libya has sunk into chaos, four years since longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi's ouster. The country is split between two rival parliaments and governments. One is based in the capital, Tripoli, and is backed by militias allied with Islamist factions. The other is the elected parliament, which has been forced to relocate and old sessions in the far eastern city of Tobruk, near the Egyptian border.","Three blasts rock town of Qubba close to the ISIS-controlled city of Derna .

"Laboour branded the Tories 'the political wing of the hedge fund industry' Labour branded the Tories ‘the political wing of the hedge fund industry’ as the latest figures underlined their dependence on donations from City figures. Almost £2 million of Tory donations in the last quarter of last year came from hedge fund donors – and three Tory donors were named last week as having previously held accounts at the Swiss branch of HSBC. Hedge funds have defended themselves against criticism from Ed Miliband, arguing that they contributed £4 billion in British taxes last year. But Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: ‘The Tories are now the political wing of the hedge fund industry. ‘The Tory election campaign is increasingly reliant on those who dine exclusively at the Prime Minister’s top table and a select few from the world of finance. The Tories’ plan is failing working families because their priority has been to help a few at the top.’ The biggest Conservative donors were Michael Gooley, founder of travel company Trailfinders, who gave £500,000; Lord Glendonbrook, the former owner of BMI (£334,000); and David Rowland, a property magnate (£322,000). The three donors named as having had accounts with the Swiss Branch of HSBC were Georg Von Opel, who gave £105,900; Edward Lee (£17,200) and Anwar Pervez (£8,000. Being a client of a Swiss bank is not against the law, and does not prove tax avoidance or evasion. There is no suggestion that any of the individual donors did anything unlawful. The Electoral Commission figures also reveal that former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has donated more than £500,000 to the three main political parties through one of his companies. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, pictured right, and Michael Gooley, founder of travel company Trailfinders, pictured left, are both donors . Bloomberg TradeBook, a British-registered financial markets broker, has given £240,000 to Labour, £210,000 to the Liberal Democrats and £100,000 to the Conservatives since January 2011. Including gifts in kind, the company has almost doubled its political donations in the past four years to £640,704, compared with £369,567 in the four years ahead of the 2010 election. Mr Bloomberg, whose ex-wife is from England, has called Britain his second home. Mr Bloomberg declined to comment last night.","Almost £2 million Tory donations came from hedge fund donors .

"This is the shocking moment a man mugged a 90-year-old pensioner for her handbag while high on a legal drug called 'Clockwork Orange'. CCTV footage showed Sheldon Woodford, 24, stalking pensioner Betty Aldworth moments before the cowardly attack in Boscombe, near Bournemouth, Dorset, which knocked her to the ground and left her with knee and shoulder injuries. Drug addict Woodford was later named to police by his ashamed mother after she recognised her son in a police appeal on Facebook. CCTV footage shows Sheldon Woodford stalking Betty Aldworth on Michelgrove Road, Bournemouth . Woodford then snatches her bag in the attack which left her collapsed on the pavement . He can then be seen attempting to make a getaway with her bag while she remains lying on the ground . He was yesterday jailed for four-and-a-half years at Bournemouth Crown Court after pleading guilty to robbery. The court heard that Woodford was addicted to cannabis-like legal high Clockwork Orange, and had nine previous convictions for 26 offences including five robberies. Police were called to Michelgrove Road on the morning of December 29 after passers-by saw the OAP lying on the pavement and Woodford running off with her handbag. Woodford was chased by witnesses down nearby roads before dropping the bag, which was returned to a shaken Mrs Aldworth. As police sought to identify the thief, the CCTV footage was circulated and Woodford's own mother shopped him to police. Detective Constable Leo Glendon, from Bournemouth CID, said Woodford's mother Sharon chose to hand him over to police for the sake of the community's safety. Pictured left is Woodford on Michelgrove Road immediately prior to the incident. Right, can be seen grinning in his police mugshot . DC Glendon said she saw the police photo of her son on Facebook and 'felt it right' to come forward. 'Woodford's mother saw the CCTV footage on her Facebook feed and instantly recognised the man in it as her son. 'She felt that any loyalty towards her son was superseded by the fact that he had picked on a vulnerable, elderly lady. 'She felt it was right to come forward and inform us due to the nature of the crime and the fact Woodford was targeting elderly people and could still be a danger to them. 'We received a call from Woodford's mother on January 2 during which she said ""That's my son"". 'She wanted him to be forced to get help and the only way that was going to be possible is if he was put behind bars. Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, told Bournemouth Crown Court how a passing van driver, Robert Edwards, had seen the attack and chased Woodford into the grounds of a nearby hotel. She said Mr Edwards saw the defendant drop the handbag so he went to check on Mrs Aldworth, leaving two other passersby to monitor Woodford. The attack occurred on Michelgrove Road, Bournemouth (pictured), while 90-year-old Mrs Aldworth was making her way home from the shops . Les Smith, mitigating, said Woodford had been high at the time of the incident and was ashamed of his actions. He said Woodford had moved back to Bournemouth from the home he shared with his partner and baby in Chippenham, Wiltshire, after becoming overwhelmed by his role as a father. He said: 'He was tearful at the incident, he was tearful at the police station, he was tearful to the probation officer and he was tearful in conference. 'In the words of his own mother, it all got too much for him. He came back to Bournemouth to live with a friend who had been released from prison and both descended into further drug misuse.' Judge Peter Johnson described Woodford's crime as 'a cowardly, despicable act'. He said: 'That injury is still causing her pain. The sentence of this court must be a severe one.'","CCTV footage showed Sheldon Woodford, 24, stalking OAP Betty Aldworth .

"Boris Johnson and Chancellor George Osborne have announced more 24-hour rail services in London in a £6.4 billion boost to the capital's economy. The pair donned hard hats and neon orange hi-vis jackets  to join the London Underground night shift team ahead of the announcement that night-time services will be expanded to include the London Overground and the Docklands Light Railway- creating half a million jobs. The Mayor of London and Mr Osborne shared a tea break with Tube workers and viewed overnight engineering works on the Victoria line before before going on to outline a six-point plan including 24-hour London Overground services in 2017 and all-night services on the Docklands Light Railway by 2021. Scroll down for video . The pair donned hard hats and hi-vis on a visit to see the overnight engineering works as part of the continuing programme to upgrade London's tube system . But shortly after their night-time stint, the politicians were back in hi-vis- this time in a fetching yellow- to demonstrate their plastering skills at a new London housing development. Both the Chancellor of the Exchequer Mr Osborne and Johnson attempted to help plaster at the Aura residential development which is under construction, in the Edgware district, before announcing plans to identify public sector sites in London for future housing developments. There they also announced the expansion of 24-hour rail services in London, as well as extended wi-fi on the Tube. However, rail unions described the announcement as a 'blatant pre-election stunt' and queried how the £6.4 billion had been worked out. Currently 24-hour services are due to begin on the Northern, Victoria, Piccadilly, Jubilee and Central lines from September 12. Both the Chancellor of the Exchequer Mr Osborne and Johnson attempted to help plaster at the Aura residential development which is under construction, in the Edgware district, before announcing plans to identify public sector sites in London for future housing developments . Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and Mayor of London Boris Johnson met with London Underground workers in one of the tunnels on the Victoria Line ahead of the announcement of more 24-hour rail services in London . Time for a break: George Osborne and Boris Johnson have a tea stop with some of the London Underground workers during their visit . Night-time Tube services will also be expanded to the Metropolitan, Circle, District, and Hammersmith and City lines once Transport for London's modernisation programmes are completed. The Government said it will provide £10 billion of funding for investment in new TfL infrastructure over the next parliament, including new Tube improvements, better roads, more buses and cycle lanes, amid predictions that London's population will top 10 million by the early 2030s. The Mayor of London also confirmed plans for 200 more Routemaster buses this year and committed to 800 new buses a year from 2016, securing jobs in Ballymena and Falkirk, where 90 per cent of TfL's buses are manufactured. Mr Osborne said: 'We are today committing to provide London with £10 billion for new transport improvements. 'We live in a 24-hour city, and the Mayor is going to set out how our plan will deliver a 24-hour Tube operation to support it. Getting their hands dirty: London's Mayor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer get stuck in to help with the late night engineering works . Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Chancellor George Osborne said that night-time services will be expanded to include the London Overground and the Docklands Light Railway- creating half a million jobs . 'I am also asking the Mayor to think big about the capital's long-term needs. 'I want these plans and others worked up, properly costed and prioritised so we can make a decision to go ahead in the Government's spending round this summer.' Mr Johnson said: 'As London's population continues to grow, it is investments in infrastructure such as this which will ensure that the capital remains competitive and the best big city to live in. 'Today we have committed to additional night Tube services, the first 24-hour London Overground and the purchase of hundreds of brand new buses. This, combined with the promise of future investment in projects such as Crossrail 2 and the Bakerloo Line extension, will ensure we keep the capital's economy moving well into the 21st century.' Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, said: 'This announcement has been dropped on London by the Mayor as a blatant pre-election stunt without a shred of consultation with the union. That is a ridiculous way to conduct important negotiations and to unveil major service developments. The pair, pictured enjoying a tea break, have outlined a six-point plan including 24-hour London Overground services in 2017 and all-night services on the Docklands Light Railway by 2021, an expansion of 24-hour Tube services, as well as extended wi-fi on the Tube . Mr Osborne, who had visited the tunnels of the Victoria line with Boris Johnson, said Londoners lived in a 24-hour city and needed a 24-hour Tube operation to support it . 'RMT is not opposed to extended running but there are massive issues on staffing, safety and maintenance which have not been addressed and which would need to be signed off by our reps. 'This announcement has been made against the backdrop of a near doubling in assaults on staff, cuts to over 1,000 jobs and the axing of guards on London Overground. 'Night running would mean increased drunkenness and risks to both passengers and staff alike and could only work with substantial increases in staffing right across the board, and that means an immediate reversal of the current cuts programme.' Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: 'Boris Johnson's publicity stunts are getting more and more desperate and deluded as he heads for the exit door at City Hall to become an MP on May 7 for Uxbridge. 'How he and George Osborne think they can dream up policies in Tory Central Office for the next Labour mayor to follow when he or she is elected next year is beyond me. 'His night Tube starting in September will lose millions and is not due to break even for another 18 years, and yet here he is, with another back-of-a-fag-packet publicity stunt.'

"This is the shocking moment a callous teenage carer was caught on camera stealing from a vulnerable pensioner's purse. Sheryvone Brooks was filmed reaching into a kitchen drawer at 85-year-old Evelyn Nicholson's house in Stourbridge, Dudley. The 19-year-old's actions were caught on a camera installed by Mrs Nicholson's family who had noticed money going missing from the elderly woman's home. Sheryvone Brooks was filmed taking £30 out of Mrs Nicholson's purse after the elderly woman's family installed a camera when they noticed money going missing from her home . Mrs Nicholson was said to be 'devastated' by the theft and would have given the teenager money if she had asked her for it, her son said . Brooks, who worked for Gateway Health and Social Care Dudley, was found guilty of theft at Wolverhampton Crown Court. In the video, the teenager is seen sitting in a chair in Mrs Nicholson's kitchen talking to another carer. She is filmed opening the drawer then looking around the room to see if anyone is watching her. The teenager then stood up, covering the brown leather purse with her body while she took out £30. The teenager then stuffed the money into the pocket of her hooded sweatshirt before returning the purse to the drawer . She stuffed the cash in her pocket before returning the purse to the drawer. Mrs Nicholson's family said she had been left 'devastated' by the theft, and that she would have given money to the teenager had she asked for it. The teenager (seen leaving court) was fired from her job . Speaking after the case, the 85-year-old's son, Robert Smith told the Express and Star: 'She was devastated and it has affected her health. 'It's absolutely disgusting. It had happened a couple of times before at the end of last year, so I set up the camera on New Year's Day,' said Robert Smith, Mrs Nicholson's son. 'I knew that we would catch the person but the video is still shocking. 'You are supposed to put your trust in carers but then one does something like this, and it destroys that trust. 'I hope she gets a severe sentence for what she has done. In total I think she took something close to £200 over three occasions. 'The video was taken first thing in the morning while the other carer was getting my mum out of bed.' The court heard how Brooks said she needed the money to pay for Christmas presents when she committed the theft on January 6. She has since repaid the money, describing the incident as 'stupid and opportunistic'. Timothy Talbot-Webb, defending, said: 'She knew it was wrong.' While the sum of money stolen was 'minor', magistrates referred the case to crown court because of the breach of trust involved. Brooks, who has been fired from Gateway Heath and Social Care, will be sentenced next month.","Sheryvone Brooks was filmed stealing from Evelyn Nicholson's home .

'Initial indications are a silver car was driving down the road when a one-year-old child, chasing another child on a bike, has run out in front of the car and been struck by it,' he said. Police were called to the scene at Spenser Rd in Enderley, Hamilton, New Zealand at about 9:10pm last night.The man, who was in a silver car was driving down the road when a one-year-old child ran out in front of him. After stopping to ascertain any injuries, angry bystanders aggressively assaulted the man . 'The driver has stopped at the scene but was dragged from his vehicle by a number of people and seriously assaulted. He has then fled to a nearby address.' The Inspector said the man, who had done the right thing by stopping to assess the situation, suffered a painful assault at the hands of the locals and said their actions will not be tolerated. 'Such behaviour cannot and will not be tolerated. In such situations a driver is obliged to stop and ascertain any injuries. 'It is the police's role to investigate and hold people to account, not emotional bystanders,' Mr Nicholls said.

"A Californian congressman has announced that he is a 'proud grandpa' to a transgender grandchild. Eight-term San Jose Democrat Mike Honda, 73, made the announcement via a tweet on Wednesday, along with a photo of himself with his arm around eight-year-old Malisa. 'As the proud grandpa of a transgender grandchild, I hope she can feel safe at school without fear of being bullied,' he tweeted. Pride: Mike Honda has announced that he has nothing but admiration for his granddaughter and hopes she and others like her can be free of the fear of being bullied . Malisa is the middle of three children born to Honda's daughter Michelle who is a public health educator in San Jose. Honda has decided to speak publicly about his family after Malisa told her grandfather that she would like to be a role model for others in her position and gave her permission for him to go public with her story. Mom Michelle Honda-Phillips told San Jose Mercury News that her child – initially called Brody – had wanted to be referred to as a girl since she had learned to speak. 'She has never hidden who she was,' said Honda-Phillips, 39, on Thursday. 'The only thing that's changed is her pronoun and her name. She's been exactly the same.' The family has revealed that Malisa made her transition last July, when she adopted her new name and started to wear girls clothes in public. In the fall she was enrolled by her parents at a new school  and - with the support of administrators - she was registered as a girl. Honda's daughter Michelle has revealed that Malisa had wanted to be referred to as girl since she was old enough to speak . 'She's very proud of being transgender. She's embraced the fact she's transgender and she's different and everyone should be comfortable in their skin,' said Honda-Phillips. The family say they expect people to voice criticism and concern over allowing someone so young to determine such a big change. People will say 'it's just a phase or they'll grow out of it,' said Honda. 'But we have to be a little bit more in tune with what youngsters are telling us. From there we can develop better solutions, be more thoughtful.' Michelle said they had waited until they were confident that Malisa was 'insistent, persistent and consistent' about her gender - three thresholds recommended by the transgender community. The family is currently looking into hormone therapies that would delay Malisa's puberty. Honda, the House Democratic Senior Whip and a longtime supporter of the LGBT community, co-founded the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus . Honda also mentioned his transgender grandchild in a video played at a conference for school superintendents in Southern California also Wednesday. 'We need to ensure that our LGBTQ youth are never bullied because of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. These children need our protection and our love,' he posted on Facebook. Honda, the House Democratic Senior Whip and a longtime supporter of the LGBT community, co-founded the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus with openly gay lawmakers Sen. Tammy Baldwin and former Rep. Barney Frank. He also founded and heads the Congressional Anti-Bullying Caucus, which launched in 2012. 'I came to Congress to fight for the civil and human rights of Americans of all sexual orientations, genders and ethnic backgrounds. All Americans deserve the right to work, live, and love in peace and free from intimidation and prejudice,' he said at the time.","Eight-term San Jose Democrat Mike Honda made the announcement via a tweet on Wednesday .

"Many people turn their phone off overnight or when charging, but a new malware could be taking advantage of this power-saving technique. Security researchers have spotted a virus that kicks in when the power button on Android phones and tablets is pressed. It makes the phone appear to be switched off but instead the malware is running in the background making calls, sending messages and accessing other files and apps. The malware is installed when the user downloads infected apps. When the power button is pressed, the malware shows a fake dialogue pop-up designed to look like the Android Power off menu (pictured). The phone then appears to shut down and the malware can make calls, send messages and access other files . In theory, once installed and enabled, the app has control of the phone and can perform any task the hacker wants it to. A blog post from the Amsterdam-based antivirus firm explained that the malware is installed when the user downloads an infected app from an app store. AVG hasn’t revealed which apps are carrying the malware and MailOnline has contacted the firm for more information. It’s likely the apps are installed from third-party app stores rather than Google Play, due to Google’s strict policy on malware. The malware is installed when the user downloads infected apps. When the power button is pressed, the malware makes the phone appear to shut down. The malware can then make calls, send messages and access other files and apps. Experts said the the only way to know a phone is actually turned off is to remove the battery. The app runs in the background, so isn’t immediately noticeable and won’t appear as a rogue app or icon on the homescreen. But, running a scan using an antivirus app will detect and remove the files. However, the Play Store has featured infected apps in the past, so users are advised to download all apps with caution, and to check reviews and developer details if they are unsure. ‘This malware hijacks the shutting down process of your mobile, so when the user turns the power off button to shut down their mobile, it doesn’t really shut down,’ said the researchers. ‘After pressing the power button, you will see the real shutdown animation, and the phone appears off. Although the screen is black, it is still on. ‘While the phone is in this state, the malware can make outgoing calls, take pictures and perform many other tasks without notifying the user.’ The malware does this by hijacking a line of code in the shutting down process and asking for root permission. This gives the hacker permission to access and modify any files, apps and software on the device.

Lenovo has come under fire for selling laptops that come pre-installed with a 'horrifically dangerous' software named Superfish. The Chinese computer manufacturer says Superfish helps users find products online by analysing images and presenting similar, cheaper products. But security analysts claim that what Superfish actually does is serve intrusive ads, as well as compromise private information such as bank details and passwords. The Superfish software appears to affect Internet Explorer and Google Chrome on the Lenovo laptops sold between September 2014 and January 2015. Users can find out if they are affected by looking at Windows' list of trusted certificates by opening up the Control Panel and searching for 'certificates'. If Superfish Inc is one of them, the computer may be vulnerable to attack. Rather than simply uninstalling the programme, users are advised to back everything up on their systems and install a new operating system.","The malware is installed when the user downloads infected Android apps .

"A 31-year-old man has been killed by an upper-cut from Batman - according to his family's obituary printed in their local newspaper. Stephen Merrill 'found humor in just about everything' before his unexpected death last Monday, relatives in Winter Haven, Florida, said. So as they sat down to write his obituary, still waiting for a post mortem to determine the cause of death, they decided to have some fun. Despite speculation that his cancer may have returned, after receiving the all-clear in 2013, they decided comic-book-lover Merrill would want a more exciting send-off. Superhero fight: Stephen Merrill, 31, was recovering from cancer but his death was unexpected. His family decided he would have wanted a playful obituary so wrote that he had been killed by Batman . The Ledger's editors initially refused to publish the piece, but after a meeting the family convinced them it was the perfect tribute to Merrill, a father-of-one. 'He would have been honored to have died by an uppercut from Batman,' his fiancée, Stephanie Vella, told ABC. 'It’s so great that they honored his family’s wishes. He wouldn’t have wanted you to come across his obit and be sad. He would have wanted you to come across the obit and laugh and have your spirits lifted.' Merrill, who worked at Legoland, had surgery in Thanksgiving after tests suggested his cancer had returned. Relatives felt he seemed healthy up until his death. He had many of Captain America's qualities, Vella said, as he was considerate, helpful, and left an impression on people. It's official: The newspaper initially refused to print the spoof obituary before the family implored them to . At his funeral, family members wore superhero t-shirts, and the program featured a quote from The Avengers. The obituary read: 'Stephen Merrill, 31, passes away February 12, 2015, due to a uppercut from Batman. 'He was born January 28, 1984, the son of Larry Ronald Merrill and Bridgett I. Dotson Merrill. He was in retail sales at The Big Shop in Legoland, Florida. 'In addition to his parents, Stephen is survived by his fiancée, Stephanie Vella; son, Noah; and sister, Kimberly. 'Visitation is Tuesday, February 17, 2015, from 12-1PM with a celebration of life at 1PM, both at Ott-Laughlin Funeral Home, Winter Haven.'","Stephen Merrill died unexpectedly last week, cancer may have come back .

"Whether it's opening emergency exits on a plane or throwing hot noodles on a flight attendant, Chinese tourists seem to have a penchant for making headline news. And now a helpful guide has been published with a list of do's and don'ts to help them along their way, and keep them out of trouble, when on their travels. Chinese media agency Xinhua has put together a list of tips for travellers, which includes details about specific laws and customs in countries around the world. China's state-led media agency Xinhua has devised a helpful guide for tourists travelling abroad . Tourists are advised not to talk about pigs or wear clothing with images of pigs when travelling to Dubai, while those trekking in Fiji are told to steer clear of pilfering coral as a memento. And no matter where in the world you are dining, you shouldn't snap your fingers at a waiter - that kind of behaviour is for dogs, according to the guide. Xinhua is also telling Chinese holidaymakers to resist the temptation to pose and 'say cheese' when standing next to a Masai warrior in Kenya, and smoking should not be done unless they can 'see the sky.' The last few months have seen a string of embarrassing and high-profile incidents of bad behaviour by Chinese tourists, denting their reputation worldwide. Two passengers aboard a flight in China were jailed in January after opening the plane’s emergency exit . During a flight from Bangkok to Nanjing last month a couple scalded a Thai stewardess with hot water and noodles and threatened to blow up the plane after a heated exchange. At the time state media branded the passengers 'barbarians' and four of the tourists have since been blacklisted by the provincial tourist board. Just days later a plane was nearly forced to return after a brawl broke out between four women on a flight from mainland China to Hong Kong over a noisy baby. A passenger on a China Eastern flight opened an emergency slide because he wanted to get off the plane . Also in December, a Chinese passenger on board an internal Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu sparked a safety scare by yanking open an emergency exit just before a plane was due to take off to 'get some fresh air', Southern Metropolis Daily reported. And now authorities in China have said they will monitor and rank incidents of misbehaviour by their  tourists abroad. The reports will be  passed on to tour operators and travel agents for them to decide whether to do business with the tourists again. The program, put forward by China's National Tourism Administration (NTA), is designed to  curb incidents of violent or disruptive behaviour by mainland tourists while travelling. A flight attendant covers her face after a passenger splashed her with a cup of hot water and noodles . NTA chairman Li Jinzao said that the information would be given to travel companies to allow them to decide 'whether to sell the person that ticket, or whether to let them take my flight,' according to South China Morning Post. The new classification system will be launched in the second quarter and will also include information on the number of complaints received by attractions and hotels, how many had been dealt with and – of those that had been handled – how many customers had been satisfied with the outcome. Authorities in China are now monitoring the behaviour of its people when travelling abroad . This isn't the first time that Chinese authorities have spoken out on the issue. Wang Yang, one of China's four vice premiers, gave a disparaging view of Chinese tourists in 2013. He was quoted by the Guardian as saying: 'They speak loudly in public, carve characters on tourist attractions, cross the road when the traffic lights are still red, spit anywhere and [carry out] some other uncivilized behaviour. It damages the image of the Chinese people and has a very bad impact.' In 2013, the government introduced a new set of laws, primarily to regulate tour operators, including a clause advising Chinese tourists to behave well wherever they went in the world.","Alarming rise in number of negative incidents involving Chinese tourists .

Jennifer is a finalist for the Miss Wales competition and hopes to win the title next month . Merle, who is pictured wearing a chic black swimming costume, was once crowned Miss Cardiff . Merle wore her Miss Cardiff sash whilst larking about for a photoshoot . Jen said: 'Mum was always so modest about her many successes as a beauty queen but I was fascinated and used to ask to see her old photos often. 'Her smile would just shine out of the pictures and she always looked so glamorous. She kept her trophies in the attic but I liked digging them out to play with. 'I was utterly heartbroken when mum died. It was hard for a very long time to keep it together day to day. 'I was even envious of friends when they moaned about their mums. I'd have given anything for a teenage row with mine.' Jen hopes to keep her mum's memory alive by winning the Miss Wales final in Swansea, South Wales, next month.

"A massive operation to retake Iraq's second-largest city from the Islamic State using up to 25,000 Iraqi troops will likely begin in April or May, a senior U.S. military official said today. The official from U.S. Central Command said the operation would involve 12 Iraqi brigades, five of which would be trained for the mission by the coalition in the coming weeks. Those five would make up the core fighting force that would launch the attack. But they would be supplemented by three smaller brigades serving as reserve forces, along with three Peshmerga brigades who would contain the Islamic State fighters from the north and west. News of the offensive comes amid reports the terror group is facing a growing number of defections and cases of corruption in its ranks in two of its major strongholds, Mosul and Raqqa. Scroll down for video . Islamic State fighters parade in a commandeered Iraqi security forces armoured vehicle through the Iraqi city of Mosul in June last year. The U.S. is planning a massive operation to retake the city in April or May . The operation to retake Mosul should begin in April or May utilising 12 Iraqi brigades made up of between 20,000 and 25,000 troops . Sprawling terror: News of the offensive comes amid reports ISIS is facing a growing number of defections and cases of corruption in its ranks in two of its major strongholds, Mosul and Raqqa . Sources say morale has plummeted in recent weeks following the loss of the Syrian city of Kobane and disgust over the horrific murder of the Jordanian pilot who was burned to death. In its de facto capital of Raqqa, activists say disillusioned jihadi militants are trying to steal identity papers from locals in a bid to flee to Turkey or areas controlled by the Nusra Front, an Al Qaeda affiliate fighting ISIS in Syria. The group, Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, says ISIS is becoming increasingly concerned about the problem and is making announcements in mosques re-iterating that its fighters are banned from such thefts. Meanwhile, one activist in Mosul said residents were desperately finding ways to circumvent a written guarantee imposed by ISIS that allows the jihadists to take property from people who flee the city. Some were being helped by corrupt ISIS officials who are agreeing to turn a blind eye for a $500 bribe, it was reported by The Times. Giving further details of the planned assault on Mosul, the U.S. official said there also would also be a fighting force, largely made up of former Mosul police and tribal forces, who would have to be ready to go back into the city once the army units clear out the Islamic State fighters. Clean-up teams continue the arduous task of removing rubble and dead bodies from Kobane's streets after it was recaptured from ISIS during months of bloody fighting and U.S.led air strikes . Many of the streets inside the ancient city of Kobane are now little more than rubble-strewn ruins . The terror group has faced a growing backlash over the brutal death of Jordanian pilot  Lt Moaz al-Kasasbeh (above) who was burned to death in an ISIS video released earlier this month . Included in the force would be a brigade of Iraqi counterterrorism forces who have been trained by U.S. special operations forces. The brigades include roughly 2,000 troops each. The official was not authorized to discuss the operation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Military leaders don't often disclose as many details of an operation before it takes place, but in some cases it can have an impact on the enemy, trigger a reaction or even prompt some militants to flee before the assault begins. The operation itself comes as no surprise to the Islamic State group. Iraqi leaders have for months made it publicly clear that they were planning an operation to retake Mosul and that they were eager to get started. In addition, U.S. officials had already acknowledged that they were beginning preparations for the Mosul mission, including using airstrikes to shut down supply lines that the insurgents were using to get equipment or people in and out of the city. Asked why U.S. Central Command was telegraphing the timeframe and details of the operation to the enemy, the official said it was important to highlight the effort the Iraqi security forces are putting into the mission and how committed they are to it. The official said the U.S. will provide military support for the operation, including training, air support, intelligence and surveillance. Mosul dam (above) fell to Islamic State militants in June while marching over a large part of the country . The official said there has been no decision made yet on whether to send in some U.S. ground troops to help call in airstrikes. That decision would be made by senior defense and military leaders and President Barack Obama. Islamic State militants overtook Mosul last June, as the group marched across large sections of Iraq and Syria, sending Iraqi forces fleeing. At this point, officials estimate there are between 1,000 to 2,000 Islamic State insurgents in the city of Mosul. Military leaders have been talking about retaking the city for some time, but they have said they won't launch the operation until the Iraqi troops are ready. The official said they wanted to retake Mosul in the spring, before the summer heat and the holiday month of Ramadan kick in. ""But by the same token, if they're not ready, if the conditions are not set, if all the equipment they need is not physically there and they (aren't) trained to a degree in which they will be successful, we have not closed the door on continuing to slide that to the right,"" he said. Under the plan, the approximately 3,200 Iraqi forces that have completed the training already or are going through it now would replace the five main brigades wherever thay are now, and those five units would then go through several weeks of final training before the Mosul operation begins. The official also revealed for the first time that Qatar has agreed to host a training site for coalition forces to train moderate Syrian rebels who would return to Syria to fight the Islamic State forces there. Other sites are in Turkey, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The training facility in Jordan is ready to go. The technical agreement on the Turkey training site was signed Thursday, and it is nearly ready. The facility in Saudi Arabia will be ready to open in one to three months, and the site in Qatar will be finished in six to nine months, the official said. The U.S. and other coalition nations will train the Syrian fighters so they can return to their own country and battle the Islamic State group.","Official from U.S. Central Command says mission begin in April or May .

"Agatha Christie's inspiration and a favourite hideaway on the coast of Devon, Burgh Island Hotel, will after all be fitted with 200 controversial solar panels following dramatic objections from locals. The proposed set of eco-panels have been described by a former owner as 'horrific' and a neighbour as 'a monstrous carbuncle on an old friend' during the development application process. But it has finally concluded with Bigbury-On-Sea parish council being over-ruled by its 'big brother' South Hams District Council, who have approved the addition. The historic Burgh Island Hotel will have 200 controversial solar panels fitted after council gave approval . Fierce opposition by a former owner and local parish council was over-ruled by South Hams District officers . One person in opposition to the  changes claimed the 'Miss Marple' and 'Murder on the Orient Express' author would 'turn in her grave' at the thought of the 1930s Art Deco hotel near Sidmouth being 'scarred' by the 21st century solar panels. But planners thought otherwise and have granted permission to current owners Tony Orchard and Deborah Clark to go ahead with the £50,000 project after they submitted revised plans. They say the panels would enable the hotel to produce 10 per cent of its heating and lighting bill from renewable energy - sustainable for the environment and their business. Mrs Clark said: 'The parish council of Bigbury has always been very hostile to anything we've proposed for Burgh Island. I think their opposition to this plan was borne out of malice. 'We're really pleased that common sense has prevailed. This is not a solar farm to sell energy to the grid, this is a small array to make our business more resilient to energy market fluctuations. It will help cut our energy bills by 10 per cent.' Mrs Clark said she had considered a wind turbine for the island but instead went with a plan to use state-of-the-art solar panels from Exeter-based company SunGiftEnergy. The beautiful island served as inspiration for the novels by legendary crime author Agatha Christie . The plans for the 200 solar panels, which were on display on the South Hams District Council website . The hotel was frequently visited by Christie, who used the setting as inspiration for a number of her novels including 'And Then There Were None' and 'Evil Under The Sun', a Hercules Poirot mystery. Several local residents said the panels, which will be fitted on disused tennis courts, would spoil the beauty of the hotel. South Hams planning officers' report said: 'The sensitivity of Burgh Island is fully acknowledged. 'The proposed solar array would actually represent a very minor change to it. Any harm caused by the proposed development to the character of Burgh Island and its famous listed hotel is considered to be very slight.' Deborah Clark, pictured with co-owner Tony Orchard, is 'really pleased that common sense has prevailed' Agatha Christie used the setting as inspiration for a number of her novels including 'Evil Under The Sun' Mrs Clark said the panels should be in place by April once the finances for the scheme have been secured: 'This is a rational decision which we always thought would be made, correctly, on the grounds of public policy, political guidance, best practice and - most importantly - the desirability of sustainable energy for our country. Guests can walk to the island at low tide or catch this sea tractor across to the hotel . 'Devon, and the West Country, are at the forefront of the sustainable energy drive and will be its standard bearer into the next decade. 'There are more homes and businesses using solar energy in the South West than in London.' The project had received support from the National Trust and English Heritage, she said. 'We feel strongly that sustainable energy is best practice where ever it can be employed, even in the context of listed buildings. 'In this, we are following a modern and progressive path that would have been recognised by the original pioneers of Burgh Island in the 1920s and '30s. 'Burgh Island was one of the founder members of The Green Tourism Business Scheme, taking a Bronze award at its inception in 2003 and holding Gold since 2010.' Parish councillor Rose Owen said while she agreed with the 'need for sustainability and finding alternative methods of producing power' the area is one of 'outstanding natural beauty.' 'It's a historic island so it is totally inappropriate and out of place,' she said. Former owner Tony Porter, who sold the island in 2001, previously stated he was 'horrified' by the proposal and said the panels would have appalled Agatha Christie. 'We spent 16 years doing everything we could to restore it to its former beauty,' he said. 'Now this green island sleeping in the sun is going to be scarred by this horrible shiny thing. It will be visible from miles away. It is going to glint in the sun and spoil the whole thing.' Mrs Clark says the council's decision was 'rational' after the Bigbury parish's hostile opposition to plans . The solar panels will be fitted on a disused tennis court and be obscured by hedges, says Mrs Clark . Mrs Clark says the panels will be non-reflective and be obscured by hedges. Hubert Ashton, whose home overlooks the island said: 'This would be a monstrous carbuncle on an old friend. It would be ruinous for the beauty of the island.' Stuart Watts, of Bigbury Parish Council, said: 'As a feature the island is known around the world so this is bound to prove controversial and stir up a huge amount of interest.' A spokesman for South Hams Council said: 'I don't think this type of planning application has been put forward for the island before, but every application is looked at individually on its merits.' Burgh Island is about 820ft from Bigbury-on-Sea, and accessible by foot at low tide or by a sea tractor.","200 solar panels approved to be fitted at Burgh Island Hotel in Devon .

"The spies will wear disguises while giving evidence at the trial of Abid Naseer, who is accused of being behind a failed plot to bomb two Manchester shopping centres . A British spy has given evidence to a New York court wearing a long wig, a fake goatee and glasses as the case against a British man accused of being part of an international terror network. The MI5 officer was the first of six to testify at the US trial of Abid Naseer, who is accused of being involved in an international conspiracy, targeting Manchester and New York. All have been given permission to don disguises - including wigs and 'light make up' -  after prosecutors  convinced the judge that revealing their identities would 'pose a significant risk to their safety'. The agents testimonies are a key part of the prosecution case, as they were part of an undercover team which conducted surveillance on Naseer, 28, while investigating a failed plot to bomb Manchester's Arndale shopping centre in 2009. The Telegraph reports the agent - identified only as by his serial number 1603 - had donned a fake goatee beard, spectacles and a long, black wig for his appearance in the pre-recorded video. He told the court the team had trailed Naseer for five weeks, and he had watched him buy hair dye and followed him to Liverpool on once occasion. 'I observed him looking at a video on his phone too. It had the Twin Towers and on that video an aircraft went into the second tower,' the spy told the court. Disguised: The British spy, who tailed Naseer, gave evidence by video at his trial - which earlier heard from Najibullah Zazi, who has admitted his part in the international plot (pictured, with Naseer in the front) Prosecutors have alleged Naseer, 28, led the Manchester cell of a three-pronged Al Qaeda plot in 2009 to ‘repeat the devastation of 9/11’. As well as blowing up the Arndale Centre, the terror group planned to set off bombs in the New York subway and at the offices of a Copenhagen newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, the court heard earlier. The trial was told Naseer, who was extradited to the US two years ago, was sent to the UK from Pakistan in 2008 with co-conspirators to ‘become westerners’, manufacture explosives and plant them at a target that would ‘bomb hundreds of innocent people and cause millions of dollars of damage’. The court heard Naseer followed the terror training he received in Pakistan, communicating with his Al Qaeda handler by using the email names of women. He also used code, using women’s names for the types of explosive he was considering and referring to the actual bomb attack as a ‘marriage’ or ‘wedding’, said prosecutors. Not guilty: Naseer has repeatedly protested his innocence, claiming he was just searching for a wife . But Naseer - a Pakistani national who came to the UK on a student visa - denies he was part of the alleged conspiracy. He said that the time he spent on the Internet on sites like Qiran.com was part of his quest to find a woman to marry. He claims he only wrote about women because he was pursuing a bride and was planning an actual wedding. 'The evidence at trial will not show the defendant is an Al Qaeda member. ... He has no extremist or jihadist views,' Naseer said, referring to himself in the third person. The trial continues.

"The BBC has been criticised for stereotyping by using a kebab to explain Greece's potential exit from the eurozone. The news report explores how Greece might leave the EU - the so-called 'Grexit' - by comparing Greece to a kebab. It comes as eurozone finance ministers are gathering in Brussels for make-or-break talks that could see Greece break away from the EU. Scroll down for video . The news report about Greece's potential exit from the EU compared Greece to a kebab, using images from a British takeaway (pictured) Viewers took to Twitter to criticise the BBC for its 'lazy stereotyping' with the kebab to describe Greece . The report went on to liken the rice inside the kebab as Europe to explain what might happen if Greece quit the EU . In the report by BBC journalist Dougal Shaw, he says: 'To understand this let's think of a more familiar kind of Greek exit. Let's do it with one of the Mediterranean's finest exports, the kebab. 'Imagine it's the Greek economy. It sustains people by providing essentials such as wages and mortgages. It must never stop turning or it will be spoiled.' The report goes on to describe the rice inside the kebab as Europe. He says: 'Imagine the rice inside the kebab is the EU. I need to swap it for this other rice, the Drachma. It's a delicate operation so I'm going to deploy these dolmades. 'They represent capital controls which ban people from moving their money. The dolmades wrap up the rice so no one can take it out the country while I am switching currency. 'The rice is swapped and placed back inside the pitta bread covering ready for consumption to resume. 'The dolmades can now be safely removed.' BBC journalist Dougal Shaw likened Europe to 'rice' and Greece to a 'kebab' in a news report . Viewers took to Twitter to criticise the BBC saying it was stereotyping by using the analogy of the kebab. Steve Giddens, a journalist, said: 'Grexit explained with a kebab - nice to see the BBC are not succumbing to racial stereotyping.' University professor and author Stephen Westland wrote on: 'Greek euro exit explained - with kebab. Quite a pathetic analogy. You can do better BBC!' In 2012, Jeremy Paxman was criticised for comparing Greece's potential EU exit to that of a 'bad kebab' being 'vomited out'. The former Newsnight presenter was describing Greece's political and financial problems when he used the 'bad kebab' analogy to explain what the rest of the Eurozone may want to do with them. A BBC spokesman said tonight: “This is just one of many ways BBC News has covered the Greece debt crisis across television, online and radio. We often use graphics or videos to help break down difficult stories and get key points across.' Viewers took to Twitter to criticise the news report they described as being 'stereotyping dross' University lecturer David Roden said the report explaining Greece and the UK was 'lazy trash' It comes as ministers of the 19-member currency union will meet for the third time in 10 days to try and come up with a solution to keep Greece within the EU. On Monday night, Greece rejected a plan to extend its €240bn (£178bn) bailout, describing it as 'absurd'. Greece is likely to run out of money if a deal is not reached before the end of February. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has dropped key demands made by his Syriza party in its successful election campaign, agreeing to honour debt obligations and accept continued supervision from bailout lenders and the European Central Bank. No country has ever left the EU before and so there is no formal exit process. Chancellor George Osborne with Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis - he said a 'common solution' must be found to prevent a full-blown crisis . Chancellor George Osborne warned today the ongoing stand-off in the eurozone over Greece's debts poses a risk to Britain's economic stability. Mr Osborne said that the eurozone countries must find 'a common solution' to ward off a full-blown crisis. The Chancellor told Sky News: 'What you see now in this stand-off between the eurozone and Greece is the risk of a full-blown crisis which would do real damage to the European economy and is a risk to Britain. 'We need the eurozone to find a common solution and here at home we need to go on working through our economic plan, which has kept us safe.' Former chancellor Lord Lamont said the austerity measures forced on Greece had been 'completely counter-productive' and a compromise needed to be found. He said: 'This is a very serious situation, not just for the eurozone but for Britain too. There needs to be a compromise and more give from Germany. 'The original Greek austerity measures have been completely counter-productive and unsuccessful and need to be completely renegotiated.'","News report compares Greece to a kebab and Europe to rice in the kebab .

"It may be an unsightly 1960s concrete building derided by critics as 'monstrous' and 'inhuman'. But this Brutalist home in central London has gone on the market for a staggering £8.5million. The three-bedroom property in Hornton Street, Kensington, is commanding such a whopping fee as it includes two parking spaces, as well as a swimming pool and sauna. Scroll down for video . This 1960s concrete house in Kensington has gone on the market for the staggering sum of £8million - the average UK salary is £26,500 . Brutalist buildings have been described as 'inhuman' and 'hideous' and do not age gracefully, but this house is in a prime location . A lift services each floor of the three-bedroom house in Hornton Street, Kensington, there is a swimming pool and spa on the ground floor . Built in 1969 by the practice of Gollins Melvin Ward, for one of the partners, the house was given an interior make-over by architects Sauerbruch Hutton when acquired for the current owners. There is a swimming pool and spa on the ground floor, with windows folding away to connect the pool to the terrace and garden. A lift services each floor and the master bedroom suite occupies the majority of the second floor. But the real draw is the two parking spaces, a rare perk in the affluent borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Alan Russell, of estate agents Russell Simpson, said: 'Residents' parking permits are like gold dust in Kensington and Chelsea. 'They play an enormous part in the decision-making process of the majority of buyers, so to have two parking spaces Kensington and Chelsea is unusual and can make the house even more desirable. 'Located in ultra-prime Kensington, between two parks and with elevated, leafy views, this sunny, elegant, detached house is both practical and sensual, a real masterpiece of 20th century design.' But the 1960s designs have attracted vocal critics, including Prince Charles who likened them to 'piles of concrete'. Author Theodore Dalrymple has also described them as 'cold-hearted', 'inhuman', 'hideous', and 'monstrous'. There is a swimming pool and spa on the ground floor of the £8.5million property situated in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea . The multi-million pound property is finished with solid oak floors, Lincoln limestone, stainless steel and polished plaster . The property features a grand entrance hall on the ground floor, with a large reception room and study on the first floor . The three-bedroom property in Kensington is expected to fetch £8.5million and includes a sauna and swimming pool . Across London as a whole, the average home is now worth more than half a million pounds, according to the latest Land Registry figures. The average price in Greater London is currently £523,953. This is compared to the average house price in of £177,766 in the rest of the country. The most expensive road in the capital, Kensington Palace Gardens, has an average house price of £42.7million. London has more homes over the £1million mark than the rest of the UK combined. In Kensington and Chelsea, the typical property price tag is currently £1.28million. It is not only flats that are up for grabs. In July last year, a row of three 1950s garages near Wandsworth Common sold for £500,000 - four times the guide price - after an auction bidding frenzy. In May, six garages in affluent Parsons Green sold for £700,000. And in April, a run-down garage next to south London industrial estate, Vanguard Court, off Peckham Road, went for £550,000 after a bidding war. The brick-built former coach house was used for years to park the Mayor of Southwark's car. Parking spaces have also boomed in price, with a single space offered in a car park under the Royal Albert Hall in Kensington, west London, for £400,000.","Three-bedroom 1960s concrete property in Hornton Street, Kensington, has gone on the market for £8.5million .

"Kim Jong-un has appeared in public sporting a retro haircut that appears to have been inspired by Will Smith's character in 90s American TV show The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. The modish monocrat debuted his 'high and tight' crop during a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in North Korean capital Pyonyang yesterday. Although he went for his  signature severe shaved sides, Kim also appeared to have spent a long time crafting and blow-drying the top of his hair into a distinctive wedge that left the trendsetting tyrant looking somewhere between the Fresh Prince and early 90s heart-throb Jason Priestly. The hairstyle wasn't the only update to the North Korean leader's distinctive look, however. He also sported much smaller eyebrows than usual - suggesting he'd spent a considerable amount of time plucking excess hair from his forehead before meeting with party officials. Grand design: Kim Jong-un debuted his 'high and tight' crop during a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in North Korean capital Pyonyang yesterday . Lookalike: Kim appears to have spent a long time crafting and blow drying the top of his hair into a distinctive wedge to resemble Will Smith's character in 90s American TV show The Fresh Prince of Bel Air . SquarePants: Kim Jong-un's new haircut has inevitably inspired a number of memes on social media . Tough guy: Kim's elaborately blow-dried hair has drawn comparisons with Guile in video game Street Fighter . During appearances in 2014, Kim's hair was tightly cropped at the sides and left longer on top. He would then use hair gel to create a curtain-style centre-parting in order to look more like his grandfather - the revered Kim Il-sung who, despite dying in 1994, still holds the title of Eternal President of the Republic of North Korea. But during yesterday's meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, the debonair despot sported a well-crafted pompadour, with his thick black hair swept backwards with the help of a hairdryer, and pushed out at the sides to create a wedge effect. While his new hairstyle led to comparisons with early 90s actors and pop stars, the alterations he made to his eyebrows received less positive reviews - with Twitter users branding the new look 'odd' and 'strange'. Kim's creation: The new look prompted social media users to compare it with his 2014 signature style (left) Trim: Kim's hair wasn't the only update to his distinctive look. He also sported much smaller eyebrows than usual suggesting he'd spent  time plucking for his forehead before meeting party officials .

Some have compared Kim Jong-Un's new haircut and spectacles look to Dave the Minion in Despicable Me . Uncanny: Kim Jong-un's new look appears to have been inspired by early 90s heart-throb Jason Priestly . As many as 100,000 desperately poor North Koreans have been senT to work overseas as 'state-sponsored slaves', human rights activists have claimed. The practice has been used since the 1980s - but has reportedly accelerated under Kim Jong-un, who seized control of the country following the death of his father in 2011. Until 2012 there were thought to be up to 65,000 North Korean workers around the globe, often living and working in horrific conditions. That number has since risen to around 100,000, activists told The New York Times. Ahn Myeong-chul, head of the Seoul-based NK Watch human rights group, said North Korea is 'exploiting their labour and salaries to fatten the private coffers of Kim Jong-un.' Kim's changing appearance came as the U.S. National Security Agency identified North Korea as the source of the recent cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment after analyzing the software used in the intrusion, NSA Director Admiral Michael Rogers. Speaking to a Canadian security conference, Rogers explained that the discovery was part of the agency's efforts to develop software to counter cyberattacks. 'We ultimately ended up generating the signatures to recognize the activity ... used against Sony,' Rogers said. 'From the time the malware left North Korea to the time it got to Sony's headquarters in California, it crossed four different commanders' lines or areas in the U.S. construct.' Sony's network was attacked by hackers in November as the company prepared to release 'The Interview,' a comedy about a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The attack was followed by online leaks of unreleased movies and emails that caused embarrassment to executives and Hollywood personalities. North Korea has described the accusation as 'groundless slander.'","North Korean leader sported new hairstyle at political meeting yesterday .

"The last meal of a new species of marine reptile that lived in the seas during the time of the dinosaurs has been found preserved in a forgotten fossil stored at a museum. A palaeontologist discovered the 189-million-year-old ichthyosaur while looking through the collections at Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery. The five foot (1.5 metres) long fossil, which was thought to be a plaster copy, had been kept in storage for nearly 30 years and had been largely overlooked. The fossilised, which has been named Ichthyosaurus anningae, had lain forgotten about in Doncaster Museum for nearly 30 years. The dark mass between the ribs are the remains of the animals last meal . However, Dean Lomax, a visting scientist at the University of Manchester, noticed some unusual structures in the bone structure while browsing the museum's collection. Skin pigments preserved in fossils - including an extinct creature that swam the oceans almost 200 million years ago - have been revealed using X-rays. Scans of the beautifully-preserved marine organisms help paint a picture of the appearance of animals that died out millions of years ago. Dark traces on fossilised skin from three reptiles - a 55 million-year-old leatherback turtle, an 86-million-year-old mosasaur and a 190 to 196-million-year-old ichthyosaur dating back up to 196 million years - were found to contain melanin. This pigment is found in many animals and serves various roles, from camouflage to regulation of body temperature. It suggests the ichthyosaurs had dark skins much like some species of modern dolphin. Dr Johan Lindgren and colleagues at Lund University, in Sweden, who conducted the study said evidence of it in these creatures reflects the important evolutionary role melanin played. They said the pigment was crucial in determining whether such animals were able to live in the colder parts of the world. Trapped within the fossilised bones of the ancient reptile, which had a similar shape to modern day dolphins, were also the remains of its last meal - squid. The finding has shed new light on the diets that these ocean dwelling reptiles lived on and gives new insight into their behaviour. Squid spend most of their time in the cold, dark depths of the ocean and most modern species that feed on them tend to dive down hundreds of metres to reach them. According to scientists this suggests that ichthyosaurs may have also been capable of withstanding high pressure and cold temperatures to reach their food. Working with palaeontologists at the State University of New York, Mr Lomax has now identified the fossil as a new species that was previously unknown to science. It has been named Ichthyosaurus anningae in honor of the British fossil collector Mary Anning, who first collected ichtyosaurs in the early 1800s. Mr Lomax said: 'It has taken us seven years of comparing this fossil with other ichthyosaur specimens from around the world to establish that it is a new species. 'Finding the contents of the stomach inside were an added bonus. Most fossils of ichthyosaurs have had their gut contents removed, if there were there, when they were excavated in the early 1800s to make them more aesthetically pleasing. 'In this fossil, however, there is a mass of thousands of tiny hooks - the ends of squid tentacles. We also found a fish scale close to the gut mass too, which could also have been the remains of a meal, although it may have just ended up inside the fossil by accident.' The artists impression above shows how Ichtyosaurus anningae may have looked 189 million years ago . The fossil was found between Black Ven, near Lyme Regis, and Sea Town on the Dorset Coast in the 1980s . The sharp teeth of Ichthyosaurus anningae shown above would have allowed it to snatch squid as it swam . The fossil is the first new species of ichthyosaur to be discovered in around 130 years and is one of the most complete specimens of its age. It was originally found among the rocks somewhere between Black Ven, near Lyme Regis, and Seatown on the Jurassic Coast of Dorset during the 1980s and bought by Doncaster Museum in 1983. However, after some staff changes at the museum it was later mistakenly labelled as a plaster cast copy and left to languish in the museums collections. However, in 2008 Mr Lomax noticed that some of the fin bones appeared to be different from other species of ichthyosaurs he had seen. Working with Professor Judy Massare from the State University of New York, they compared the fossilised bones with around 1,000 other ichthyosaur remains. Their findings are published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. In their paper they describe the fossil as a new species and say it  lived in the oceans between 189 and 182 million years ago during the early Jurassic period. Dean Lomax, pictured above, discovered the new species while browsing the collection at Doncaster Museum . The scientists discovered tiny hooks from the end of squid tenticles fossilised in the remains of the reptile . During their search they discovered three other specimens in museums elsewhere in the world that they believe are also of the same species as the fossil in Doncaster. They were also able to determine that the fossil in Doncaster, which is almost complete apart from the end of its tail, belonged to an adult male. The other specimens are thought to be a subadult and two juveniles. Mr Lomax said he thought it was the first time it had been possible to determine the sex of fossilised ichthyosaurs. Dean Lomax and fellow palaeontologist Nigel Larkin examine the new species of ichthyosaur above . Ichthyosaurs are an ancient species of marine reptile that are distantly related to turtles as shown above . He said: 'There appears to have been some sexual dimorphism as the humerus bones appear to be different. We examined dimorphism in other reptiles and found this often differs significantly. 'We were able to say the fossil in Doncaster is probably a male adult.' Ichthyosaurs were once common in the world's oceans and had sharped teeth with which they are thought to have used to snatch fish as they hunted. Some fossils have been found with the remains of fish preserved inside them. It is hoped the discovery will encourage other museums to look back through their collections as there could be other new species hidden there. Dr Silvia Danise from Plymouth University told the BBC: 'Collections are treasures that show their value each time we're able to look at them with a different perspective, and by asking new scientific questions.' Palaeontologist Nigel Larkin (above) helped prepare the fossil so its features could be examined more clearly .","Palaeontologist Dean Lomax found fossil in storage at Doncaster Museum .

"The husband of a New Jersey State Assemblywoman tried to get a charitable organization that helps low-income homeowners to build them a luxury home on the Jersey Shore. Richard Stender, the husband of Assemblywoman Linda Stender, got Coastal Habitat for Humanity to assist him with demolishing their $465,000 home in Manasquan after it was damaged during Hurricane Sandy. After getting the non-profit to assist with the demolition of the single-story home, Mr Stender tried to get it replaced with a two-story house that would have been almost three times as large. Scroll down for video . The husband of New Jersey State Assemblywoman Linda Stender (pictured) has landed her in hot water . This was what the Stender's home in Manasquan looked like before it was damaged during Hurricane Sandy . Mr Stender filed zoning plans for the new 2,000-square foot house with Manasquan's construction office, NJ.com reported. The demolished home was only 700 square feet. The plans for the 'Stender residence' show four bedrooms, three-and-a-half bathrooms, an eat-in kitchen, a two-car garage and a wood-burning fireplace. Mr Stender also wanted Habitat for Humanity to put a screened porch on each floor and build an outdoor shower with a 'louvered ceiling.' Mr Stender (right) filed zoning plans for the new house with Manasquan's construction office. His wife (left), has yet to comment about the issue . Coastal Habitat for Humanity executive director Maureen Mulligan noticed the excessive plans. She said: 'When the plans were presented to Coastal Habitat and I saw them, I immediately said ""No."" 'This was not the type of house that Habitat builds, which is a three-bedroom one-and-a-half bath, 1,200-square-foot house.' NJ.com reports that Stender may not even live at the beach house. When she registered to run for reelection in 2013, she used an address in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. At the time, Assemblywoman Stender told a friend she lives with her mother and her husband lives in Manasquan. She has not commented about the plans her husband submitted, but she did confirm that her family asked for Habitat for Humanity's help. Assemblywoman Stender said: 'Like many others, our family suffered significant losses as a result of Hurricane Sandy. 'An application was made to Coastal Habitat for Humanity to assist in rebuilding. 'There are outstanding issues which are the subject of continued efforts to resolve.' No home has been built on the now-vacant site. 'The first several hundred years of settlers in Manasquan were devoted mostly to agriculture and fishing for their main economic base,' according to a New Jersey Shore website. 'In the 1800’s, investors saw the opportunity to market Manasquan as a resort town for people eager to get out of New York and Philadelphia on hot summer days. 'Today Manasquan remains one of the top New Jersey Shore getaways. Thousands flock to the beach each summer by day – and many more come to Manasquan in the evening to enjoy the fine restaurants and nightlife.'","Democratic state Assemblywoman Linda Stender's home in Manasquan was damaged by Sandy .

"A two-year-old twin girl has been crushed to death by a door as her family moved into their new home, police have said. Iva Potter's family had taken a door leading from the garage into the laundry room off its hinges so they could easily move items into the house in Lewisville, Texas on Thursday afternoon. The heavy door was leaning against a wall but somehow crushed Iva and she was found face-down on the ground, Lewisville Captain Dan Rochelle told NBCDFW. Police said they are not sure if the door fell as the little girl pulled on it or if it was blown down by a gust of wind. Tragic: Iva Potter, pictured, was crushed to death by a door that had been taken off its hinges as her family moved into a new home on Thursday. It is not clear if she pulled the door or if it was blown over . Loss: Iva, who had a twin sister, was just weeks away from her third birthday when she was killed . 'Honestly, I don't think we'll ever know the answer to that,' he said. 'There are some different theories that she may have pulled the door on her. 'There is also a wind-tunnel effect from the garage going into the house, and maybe that wind caught the door and knocked it over on her.' The girl's family called 911 and police were first to arrive on the scene. A responding officer performed CPR until paramedics arrived and she was rushed to hospital. But little Iva, who had a twin sister and was just weeks from her third birthday, was pronounced dead just before 2pm. Lewisville police are continuing to investigate but say they believe it was a tragic accident and there is no indication of foul play. Scene: Her family had been moving into this Lewisville, Texas home when the tragedy unfolded on Thursday .

"Human evolution was driven by short, rapid waves of climate change. This is according to researchers studying cone-shaped deposits of sediment in southeast Arabia that provide a 160,000 year record of the area's climate. The deposits reveal that our early human ancestors left Africa on a journey to southern Asia around 75,000 to 130,000 years ago, during multiple phases. Human evolution may have been driven by short, rapid waves of climate change.This is according to researchers studying cone-shaped deposits of sediment from southeast Arabia that provide a 160,000 year record of the area's climate. Inset is photo ofthe exposed quarry site. A person circled for scale . The find contradicts another theory that claims human populations expanded rapidly from Africa to southern Asia via the coastlines of Arabia around 50,000 to 60,000 years ago. The sediments reveal a period of increased rainfall, which scientists at Oxford University argue would have provided sufficient freshwater to support expanding populations. 'The dispersal of early human populations out of Africa is dynamically linked with the changing climate and environmental conditions of Arabia,' said Professor Ash Parton at Oxford University. 'Although now arid, at times the vast Arabian deserts were transformed into landscapes littered with freshwater lakes and active river systems. The sediments – also known as alluvial fans - were found along the Western Haja in Al Sibetah, Oman. Pictured is a stock image of alluvial fan deposits . 'Such episodes of dramatically increased rainfall were the result of the intensification and northward displacement of the Indian Ocean Monsoon, which caused rainfall to reach across much of the Arabian Peninsula.' The sediments – also known as alluvial fans - were found along the Western Haja in Al Sibetah, Oman. A previous study by University College London argued that the waxing and waning of huge lakes in the East African Rift valley was linked to the brain expansion of early human species. Professor Mark Maslin, co-author of the study, said at the time: 'It seems modern humans were born from climate change. 'They had to deal with rapid switching from famine to feast - and back again - which drove the appearance of new species with bigger brains and also pushed them out of East Africa into Eurasia and South Africa.' Pictured is a partial human skull excavated from a cave in Israel's western Galilee region. It has been described as the first fossil remains that appear to document our ancestor's journey out of Africa . Long ago, humans left their evolutionary cradle in Africa and passed through the Middle East on their way to Europe. And in January, scientists found the first fossil remains that appear to document that journey, a partial skull from an Israeli cave. The skull dates from around 55,000 years ago, fitting into the period when scientists had thought the migrants inhabited the area. And details of its anatomy resemble ancient skulls from Europe, Israel Hershkovitz of Tel Aviv University in Israel wrote in an email. The skull, which lacks facial features and its base, was found in Manot Cave in the Galilee region of northern Israel. The migrants are called modern humans because of their anatomy. The earliest remains of modern humans in Europe date to about 45,000 years ago.","Researchers made discovery after analysing sediment from Oman .

"The now-dead subject of an Oscar-nominated film is causing an argument  - and it is not about whether the documentary about her will win. A messy legal fight over who owns the rights to photos shot by Chicago nanny Vivian Maier is raging and the copyright battle threatens to slow, or even stop, new releases of her once-unknown work. Maier, whose life is chronicled in Oscar nominee 'Finding Vivian Maier,' died penniless five years ago. Scroll down for video . Prints of photos taken by nanny Vivian Maier (above) began selling for thousands of dollars after her death . Maier's work became so popular that a documentary about her, Finding Vivian Maier (pictured), was made . John Maloof bought a storage box at auction stuffed full of Maier's photo negatives for $400 in 2007 . She died with no will, no obvious heirs and no inkling that the more than 150,000 photographs she snapped in her spare time in Chicago and New York from the 1950s onward would become so prized. Maier's intimate and often-gritty photography, which she made no attempt to sell commercially in her lifetime, focused on everyday people. Since interest in her work exploded, prints of her photographs have sold for thousands of dollars. Now, two men Maier never knew are tussling over who holds the rights to print, sell and display the images she created. Center stage in the dispute is John Maloof, a 33-year-old former Chicago real estate agent who features in and co-directs the documentary. He bought a box full of Maier's negatives at auction for $400 from a repossessed storage locker in 2007. Maloof now owns the vast majority of her work, more than 100,000 images, that are mostly in negatives or undeveloped film. He traced Maier's whereabouts in the Chicago area in 2009, just days after she died at age 83. Maloof defends his project — now his full-time job — of managing his Maier collection. Years going through negatives, and paying for professional restorers and printers has cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars. Until recently, he either lost money or just broke even. He said: 'My life is 100 percent on this project. 'It is a blessing and a curse.' Maloof looks at Maier's negatives on a light table at his home in Chicago. The documentary about Maier is up for an Academy Award on Sunday . Maloof (center) said the photos are 'a blessing and a curse' and his life is '100 per cent on this project' It was Virginia-based David Deal, a longtime commercial photographer who read about Maier as he completed a law degree, who sparked the legal fight by filing a notice in a Chicago probate court last summer. Deal's filing identifies a relative of Maier's in France, retired bureaucrat Francis Baille, as Maier's closest relative — a first cousin once removed. Deal claims that makes him Maier's rightful heir. Maloof believes he has copyrights because a different Frenchman he contends is Maier's closest relative, Sylvain Jaussaud, signed over the rights to him. Deal argues that Maloof should have launched probate proceedings himself years earlier to establish who Maier's heirs were. He says it is Maloof's own fault Maier's growing ranks of fans could be deprived of much of her work. Deal said: 'We wouldn't be in this position today if he'd not cut legal corners.' Maloof calls that accusation 'garbage'. He claims a probate proceedings filing wasn't required. But once Deal took that step, it set off a drawn-out legal process. To avoid the legal headaches, an owner of a far smaller collection of Maier's photography sold it all to a Canadian gallery. Maloof has no intention of doing that. He said: 'They don't want to shut us down. I am confident something can be worked out.'","Nanny Vivian Maier began taking photos in Chicago and New York in 1950s .

"Supporters of the Islamic State have taken to Twitter to mock claims the terrorist organisation is luring women into its fold using kittens and Nutella. The original claim was made by CNN's Newsroom anchor Carol Costello on Wednesday during a piece on how ISIS twists and manipulates its image to present living in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq currently under the group's control as being a pleasant experience. The accusation was that women are falling for ISIS' use of images and videos of cute cats to make the Sunni extremists appear less intimidating, and have been duped into thinking life under the terror is similar to the West thanks to references to eating Nutella in emoji-strewn Twitter posts. The suggestion that women are being lured by the technique has been widely ridiculed - not just in the Western media, but now also by the supporters of the jihadis themselves, who have taken to posing with kittens and posting jokes about the power of the chocolate and hazelnut spread.

Suggestion: The original claim was made by CNN's Newsroom anchor Carol Costello on Wednesday. The accusation that women are falling for ISIS' use of images of cute cats and chocolate spread to make the Sunni extremists appear less intimidating has been widely ridiculed by social media users . One social media user calling themselves Abu Abdulla Amriki, who claims to be an ISIS fighter in Syria, posted a joke message about struggling to find a wife despite possessing kittens and Nutella. 'Yeh...so this is how I heard we get married...lol Why am I still single?[sic],' he posted alongside a black and white photograph of a kitten playing with a jar of chocolate and hazelnut spread. The post prompted other militants and their supporters to similar messages. One, posted by apparently British militant named Abu Hurirah al-Britani, showed a bearded fighter grinning as he holds a jar of Nutella in a photograph understood to have been taken in Syria. It was captioned with the words 'Wish I had a cat! :-(' The joke quickly spread outside the online jihadi community and soon regular Twitter users started posting memes about widely ridiculed report.

This message was posted was an account regularly suspended for uploading pro-Islamic State propaganda . Last summer ISIS militants fighting in Iraq and Syria revealed a bizarre soft spot for Nutella. Members of the jihadist group posed for photographs holding jars of the Italian sweet treat while standing in supermarkets inside the Islamic State - the group's self-declared caliphate. The images were subsequently uploaded to Twitter - sparking an intense debate among the fighters and their supporters over the virtues of Nutella. After the images of the Nutella-loving jihadists emerged on Twitter, a number of users joked that the spread could be the best way to put a halt to the group's expansion in the Middle East. One Twitter user going by the handle @FatCated asked: 'Could an embargo on Nutella or Chupa Chups (a type of lollypop) destroy the morale of #IS mercenaries? #ISIS' Another calling herself Ariane al-Britania joked: 'It is very possible that Nutella is responsible 4 the radicalization of Muslims in the West lol.'

The conversation quickly turned to Hollywood films in general, with one 19-year-old ISIS supporter - who calls himself 'Abdullah' and uses the Twiiter handle @Mujahid4life - declaring his love for all 'Disney Renaissance' films and revealing himself to be a fan of Star Wars. 'Abdullah' also said he had stopped watching hit HBO television Game of Thrones after two episodes because it contained too much nudity.

"It's got three bedrooms and a new modern design along with a generously sized outdoor space. But it's the real estate agent's six-pack that's likely to catch the attention of house-hunters looking at a Riverside property in Barwon Heads, south west of Melbourne. Levi Turner, of Bellarine Property, excited future home-owners after he ditched the suit, donned a pair of board shorts and whipped his shirt off for a video advertising a Challis Lane property. Scroll down for video . Forget the three bedrooms, it's estate agent Lev Turner's six-pack that house-hunters are focused on in this property add . Starting with an aerial shot of Mr Turner as he walks up from the shore and grabs his towel off the sand, a drone follows him as he sprints up the beach and along a road leading to the house. 'The Barwon River: what an amazing place to enjoy…imagine if this was on your doorstep only 100m away from your home,' Mr Turner is heard saying. But forget the home's interior, the rest of the video shows a close-up of a shirtless Mr Turner with a towel thrown over his shoulder, telling viewers about the home's location. The agency's managing director, Christian Bartley, told Daily Mail Australia that the video has proved a great success. 'There have been lot of jokes circulating about how many girls will be calling us about inspecting the property,' Mr Bartley jested. 'We've got 11 people that have shown interest in the property that want contracts and we've only been on the market for 14 days. Normally you'd have maybe zero to one contracts after only two weeks.' A drone filmed the Bellarine Property agent running up the sand towards the property in an effort to show its proximity to the Barwon River in Victoria . Sprinting up the road,  it's not the first time an agent from the group has chosen to strip-off his clothes in an attempt to sell the house . He also revealed that he'd gone to the extreme of stripping off some clothes to sell the same house himself. 'I sold this current property to the current owners in 2006 and when I did that, I auctioned it off and I took my pants off,' Mr Bartley said. 'That was for the purpose of demonstrating how close it was to the river: I mimicked that I was going to run to the river afterwards as a joke to the buyers.' He sold the property while wearing just a pair of board shorts and the same buyers, who are selling the home nine years later, requested that he flash some skin for the sake of a sale a second time. Still running: Mr Turner's figure can be seen at the very bottom centre of the picture as he nears the house . Forget the home's interior, the rest of the video shows a close-up of a shirtless Mr Turner with a towel thrown over his shoulder, telling viewers about the home's location . 'When I got appointed to the sale of this house again, from the owners who bought it from me last time, they requested that I auction it and asked if I would get my pants off again,' Mr Bartley said. 'I need to do something innovative and different - that's why they've appointed me to represent them, they want me grab the attention of the market.' 'Because it's so close - literally 60 seconds form the river - I wanted to showcase that through a video and I wanted it all filmed within a minute. 'The proximity of the river to the house - to showcase that through photos , it just can't be done like that, even aerial images.'

"The widow of Chris Kyle's sniper colleague has hit out at the Oscar-nominated film 'American Sniper', claiming it portrays her late husband as a coward who 'questioned America's mission in Iraq'. Marc Lee, whose shooting death in the then-battle-torn city of Ramadi is graphically depicted in the $264million box-office sensation, was deployed abroad with the Navy SEALS  in April 2006. Over the next four months, he served alongside his Charlie Platoon 'brothers', including Kyle, who is played by Bradley Cooper and whose death aged 38 at a US rifle range is not featured in the movie. However, on August 2, 2006, Lee was shot dead in a gunfight after stepping into the line of fire to protect his teammates  - an action that saw him posthumously awarded two separate honors. Now, his widow, Maya Elbaum has criticized 'American Sniper's' portrayal of her husband's service in Iraq, saying it 'deeply sacrificed' his 'truths and beliefs', as well as his selfless, but 'strong' character. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Maya Elbaum, the widow of Chris Kyle's sniper colleague, Marc Lee (pictured with Miss Elbaum), has hit out at the Oscar-nominated film 'American Sniper', claiming it portrays her late husband as a coward . Killed in war: Lee (left), whose shooting death in the then-battle-torn Iraqi city of Ramadi is graphically depicted in the $264million box-office sensation, was deployed abroad with the Navy SEALS in April 2006. Right, his widow, Miss Elbaum , said 'American Sniper' 'deeply sacrificed' her husband's 'truths and beliefs' 'SEAL brothers': During his time in Iraq before his death in August 2006, Lee (played by Lee Grimes, right, in the film) served alongside his Charlie Platoon 'brothers', including Kyle, portrayed by Bradley Cooper (left) In an article for Fox News, Ms Elbaum, who met Lee in Coronado, California in 2001, and married him in 2002, wrote: 'The character of Marc Lee falls short on everything that the real Marc Lee stood for and what Chris Kyle expresses about his brother and teammate in his book, which inspired the film.' She continued: 'The movie portrays Marc as a reluctant warrior - one who seems casual in combat - who questions America's mission in Iraq. Nothing could be further from the truth. In contrast to the movie, Marc was a fierce fighter who believed he was making a difference in Iraq.' Ms Elbaum, whose final memories of Lee are of him boarding the US Air Force's C17 aircraft with Charlie Platoon in 2006, said her husband truly 'believed in the war with his whole heart'. This belief stemmed not only from Lee's desire to serve for his beloved country, America, but also to 'protect innocent Iraqis who lived in constant fear of terrorists', she wrote in the article. As a 'Team Guy', Lee would do anything for his 'SEAL brothers', she said. These included Kyle, whose autobiography inspired the blockbuster hit, which was has been nominated for six Oscars. In action: In an article for Fox News , Ms Elbaum, who met Lee (pictured, front, in action with the EALS) in Coronado, California in 2001, and married him in 2002, wrote: 'The character of Marc Lee falls short on everything that the real Marc Lee stood for and what Chris Kyle expresses about his brother and teammate' Teammates: Lee (pictured, left, in his Army attire) worked alongside Kyle (right) in Iraq in 2006. The latter was shot dead at the age of 38 by former Marine Eddie Ray Routh at a rifle range in Stephenville, Texas, in 2013 . Happier times: Lee embraces  Miss Elbaum on their wedding day in 2002 - four years before his deployment . Indeed, the sniper's willingness to make 'the ultimate sacrifice for his country' saw him receive the Silver Star and the Purple Heart posthumously. He was also granted the Bronze Star for his service. While Ms Elbaum said Lee's initial desire to become a pastor before joining the SEALS was depicted accurately in the film, she wrote his reason for choosing the latter career was wrongly portrayed. She described the remarks by actor Lee Grimes (who plays Lee in the film) that he decided to join the SEALS because he was a 'gambling man' as 'bizarre' and not reflective of her husband's drive. She also revealed that the final letter Lee wrote before he shot dead was 'severely edited' by film executives, giving it a different, 'false' meaning that implied he died after giving up on his mission. 'Chris Kyle's character says: ""The war didn't kill Marc, his letter did"" - a confusing reference to those who knew Marc because it seems to suggest Marc gave up on the mission, and that led to his death,' she said, adding that her husband remained a devout Christian until he died, while she is Jewish. A 'strong soldier': Lee's (pictured) willingness to make 'the ultimate sacrifice for his country' saw him receive the Silver Star, the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star posthumously, Miss Elbaum wrote in the article . Revelations: Miss Elbaum (pictured during her recent interview) also revealed that the final letter Lee wrote before he shot dead was 'severely edited' by film executives, giving it a different, 'absolutely false' meaning . Portrayal: Lee is pictured in an old Facebook photo (left). He is portrayed by Lee Grimes in the film (right) However, she emphasized that she is 'truly happy' for 'American Sniper's' success - and does not want her comments about her husband's film portrayal to deter from the story of Kyle's achievements. Ms Elbaum has now released the final letter that her husband wrote two weeks before his death in a bid to portray his true character. His words were later included in pamphlets at his funeral service. In his final letter before his death, Marc Lee, the first Navy SEAL to die in the Iraq War, wrote:'I have seen war. I have seen death, the sorrow that encompasses your entire being as a man breathes his last I can only pray and hope that none of you will ever have to experience some of these things I have seen and felt here.' He finished: 'To all my family and friends, do me a favor and pass on the kindness, the love, the precious gift of human life to each other... Love Ya, Marc Lee.' Source: Fox News . In the  letter, Lee,  the first Navy SEAL to die in the Iraq War, wrote: 'I have seen war. I have seen death, the sorrow that encompasses your entire being as a man breathes his last. 'I can only pray and hope that none of you will ever have to experience some of these things I have seen and felt here.' He signed off the document: 'To all my family and friends, do me a favor and pass on the kindness, the love, the precious gift of human life to each other... Love Ya, Marc Lee.' Lee's death came seven years before Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, were shot dead at a rifle range in Stephenville, Texas, alongside by former Marine Eddie Ray Routh, 27, in 2013. Earlier this month, it was revealed that a final scene of 'American Sniper' showing Kyle's gory death at the range was cut after his wife urged screenwriters to leave it out for the sake of their young children. The late father-of-two's widow, Taya, pleaded with director Clint Eastwood and other execs not to include the horrific moment in the film, so it was omitted, screenwriter Jason Hall revealed. 'We talked about doing it but... five days after Chris was murdered, [Mrs Kyle] called and said, ""This is going to be how my children remember their father, so I want you to get right"",' Mr Hall said. Latest development: It comes as a psychologist has reportedly testified in court that Eddie Ray Routh (pictured in court on Friday) has been faking schizophrenia and knew his actions at the range were wrong . Killed: 'American Sniper', which has become a blockbuster hit, is based on Kyle's (pictured) autobiography . He added that Mrs Kyle's request had especially affected him as a father. 'I didn't want this movie hanging over [the kids'] heads for the rest of their lives as the film that showed their father getting shot,' the screenwriter told the New York Daily News. Routh is currently on trial for shooting dead Kyle and Littlefield at the rifle range. There is no doubt that he was responsible for shooting the sniper, who has the most kills to his name in U.S. histor . The former soldier has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. At the end of the trial, jurors must decide whether or not he intentionally committed the murders and knew his actions were wrong. It comes as a psychologist has reportedly testified in court that Routh, who claims he had PTSD at the time of the killings, has been faking schizophrenia and knew that his actions were wrong. Another grief-stricken widow: Taya Kyle, Kyle's widow, wipes her eyes as she testifies during Routh's trial . On Friday, psychologist Randall Price testified for the prosecution, a day after a forensic psychiatrist for the defense told the jury that he found Routh had paranoid schizophrenia and showed signs of psychosis that could not be faked. According to The Dallas Morning News, Price contested: '[Routh] did know what he was doing was wrong, and he did it anyway.' Price testified Routh does not meet the state's legal definition of insanity but has a paranoid personality disorder made worse by his heavy drug use, the reports said. Closing arguments in the case are expected as early as Monday. Prosecutors are seeking a life sentence without the possibility of parole.","Sniper Marc Lee was deployed to Iraq with the Navy SEALS in April 2006 .

FEMAIL went backstage ahead of the show to meet the team in charge of giving the stars - including Katie - a high fashion makeover. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, the 36-year-old said of her androgynous look: 'I was totally up for the team giving me a new different look for the catwalk.' Luckily for Katie, hair stylist Matt Roskell, from Francesco Group Weeping Cross, was keen to do just that. 'I have always thought Katie Price was incredibly beautiful but I always thought the tan, hair extensions, fake eyelashes detracted from rather than enhanced her beauty,' he said. 'I was really excited, if a bit nervous, about being assigned to Katie but felt this was an amazing opportunity to show her and the fash pack how fierce she can actually look.' The 36-year-old joined fellow celebrities to walk in supermodel Naomi Campbell's show, which raised money for the fight against Ebola and rocked the runway in an androgynous tuxedo . Matt, who worked alongside the Wella Professionals team, had a blast backstage with Katie - and found her a dream to work with. 'She was super lovely and although it took a little bit of reassurance, once she was on-board with my vision and agreed to it, she walked the catwalk with a confidence I haven't seen in her in a long time.' The inspiration for the look was the work of artist Patrick Nagel, who did the cover of the Duran Duran Rio album cover and inspired the Robert Palmer Addicted To Love video models. As lead hair stylist Johnnie Sapong explained, Naomi and the team wanted to create a 'structured glamour' and 'refined elegance' to complement the lavish designs on the catwalk. 'It's all about effortless glamour,' said Johnnie. 'We are creating structured ponytails with a high shine finish'. Matt said he's always thought Katie Price was incredibly beautiful but  thought the tan, hair extensions and fake eyelashes detracted from rather than enhanced her beauty . Matt added: 'It is such a strong aesthetic and Katie has such a great strong face she totally rocked it.' Katie was joined by The Duchess of York, Jourdan Dunn, Pixie Lott, and a string of other celebrities at the fundraiser in London's Somerset House. Some of the world's best known fashion houses, including Dolce & Gabbana, Stella McCartney, and Vivienne Westwood, donated items for the show. Brit Award nominee Ella Eyre performed her single 'Gravity' to a packed crowd, who also took part in an auction of luxury goods. Katie was joined by The Duchess of York, Jourdan Dunn, Pixie Lott, and a string of other celebrities at the fundraiser in London's Somerset House . Lots included an exclusive holiday to the Maldives, A Bvlgari Watch and an Alexander McQueen dress. All funds raised on the night will go to raise vital funds and awareness towards the fight against Ebola. Industry stalwart Naomi said: 'Tonight has been incredible and I am so thankful to everyone who has been involved to make the show such a brilliant success. 'The fight to raise awareness and bring aid to those affected by Ebola is a cause that I am so passionate about. 'I sincerely hope the funds raised from tonight's show will hopefully make a difference to those affected by this terrible disease.'

"She was made redundant from the Nine Network in December due to cost-cutting measures. And now Emma Freedman, 25, has opened up about how the heartbreaking ordeal left her in a flood of tears and bed-ridden for a few days afterwards. Speaking in an interview with News.com.au, she explained: 'I just cried all day. I didn’t get out of bed for a few days. It’s pretty gut wrenching … I put a lot of myself into that job and maybe that’s a lesson learned to not be so personally invested in something.' Scroll down for video . Emotional time: Emma Freedman has admitted in a recent interview she was reduced to tears and couldn't get out of bed for a few days after she was made redundant by Nine Network last December . On the job: Emma Freedman became known for her adventures working as a weather presenter . However, it wasn't just Emma who had been left angry following the axe as her famous father, horse-racing champ Lee Freedman, took to his Twitter account at the time to vent his frustration over his daughter's sudden boot from the small screen. The blonde beauty wasn't aware her dad had made such a public outburst until afterwards. But she believes he did it because he was disgusted with the way she'd been treated by the firm, despite her many years of commitment to the network. She explained: 'He’s proud of what I’ve achieved … and was upset that someone who’s given so much and has been such a loyal company person could have that happen to them for a reason that couldn’t really be defined.'

Taking to the social networking site at the time, Lee, 58, let his protective instincts as a father shine through, as he tweeted to his followers: 'Congratulations to CH 9 for firing Emma Freedman in a cost cutting measure. Wonder what they’ll do to the ones with no talent? #shot (sic).' Emma joined the Nine Network many years ago as a contributor to provide the coverage of the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival due to her family history in the horse racing industry. In 2010, she became a weather girl for Weekend Today and proved she could endure the unpredictable climatic conditions as she did live crosses  in the snow, scorching temperatures and torrential downpour.

"A Maryland teenager who became paralyzed almost three years ago used a walker to make her mark on the runway during New York Fashion Week. Megan Silcott's life drastically changed in August 2012 when she woke up paralyzed. She told GMA 'When I was 16 years old, one night I was out with my friends and I had to come home, I didn't feel that great. 'I went to bed and I woke up in the morning and I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't walk.' Silcott had hoped to become a model, according to the news program. Model: Megan Silcott became paralyzed in 2012 but has recovered to the point she can now use a walker . Big debut: Silcott used a walker in the opening and a wheelchair with designer Nina Perdomo behind her at the grand finale . A GoFundMe page for Silcott said the life-altering incident took place on August 16th, 2012. 'She was rushed to the hospital as she soon came to the realization that she was paralyzed,' it said. The teenager was suffering from Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), it emerged. Silcott's GoFundMe page described it as 'an incredibly rare neurological disorder typically brought on from a viral or bacterial infection. She was unknowingly experiencing silent mono; the type of mono one does not know that they have.' It continued 'ADEM involves an intense attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, ultimately damaging the myelin sheath. In the case of ADEM, the immune response is also responsible for demyelination, a process in which the myelin that covers many nerve fibers is stripped off.' As part of her treatment, Silcott spent six days in a coma. 'In [an] attempt to decrease the amount of spinal cord and brain swelling to prevent permanent brain damage, there was no other option,' her GoFundMe page said. Silcott received treatment from Baltimore's Kennedy Krieger Institute and continues to do so, GMA reported. 'I told myself I was going to heal from this and I was going to be able to pursue everything I wanted to pursue before,' she told the morning news program. Illness: Silcott became paralyzed after suffering from Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis . Standing tall: Silcott's physical therapist said she began in a power chair but can now use a walker . Memories: Silcott poked fun at her New York Fashion Week catwalk debut . Physical therapist Lizzie Neighbors told GMA 'She started out kind of in the power chair, with not a ton of function in her arms or legs, and she’s progressed to walking with the walker.' Designer Nina Perdomo revealed the reason she invited Megan to be one of the models, telling GMA 'I design for a woman that is strong and knows what she wants from life. And I feel like Megan is the perfect example of that.' The New York Daily News reported that Silcott was the first one down the runway on Monday for the Arts Institutes show. According to the newspaper, the crowd stood up to cheer for Silcott after she was done - and during the finale, Perdomo herself pushed Silcott down the catwalk in a wheelchair. Silcott's GoFundMe page is seeking $15,000 for 'an FES RT 300 rehabilitation therapy system bike.' Over $12,800 has already been raised. Silcott herself tweeted Thursday 'Hahaah I looked like an alien on the run way.'","Megan Silcott's life changed in August 2012 when she woke up paralyzed .

"Leon Kent, who led a group of American soldiers that knocked out five German tanks and held up the enemy advance during the Battle of the Bulge, has died. He was 99. His family tells the Los Angeles Times that Kent had pneumonia and died on Feb. 12 in Beverly Hills. Kent was an Army lieutenant in December 1944 when he was ordered to stop the advancing tanks in Belgium. Leon Kent, who was a hero at the Battle of the Bulge leading a group of men who would stop five German tanks, has died at the age of 99 . The Times reports that his battery wasn't trained in anti-tank warfare and had only an anti-aircraft gun. Nevertheless, Kent and his three soldiers destroyed five tanks in two hours and were credited with helping prevent a major German breakthrough in Belgium, allowing retreating Allied troops to regroup. At the time, a battlefield dispatch from the AP described the scene: . 'Anti-aircraft gunners, who stayed behind when the infantry withdrew, played a vital role in preventing a major German breakthrough in Belgium. … One battery, commanded by Lt. Leon Kent of Los Angeles, knocked out five tanks, including one King Tiger tank, in two hours.' The four soldiers received Silver Stars, although Kent's wasn't delivered until 1998 because of lost paperwork. While not one to boast, Kent would tell reporters he understood the danger he was in. 'If they got one shot at us, we were dead,' he said in a 2011 interview with The Times. 'I remember thinking: Do the shells go through you or do you go up in pieces?' Kent was awarded a Silver Star for his bravery on the battlefield . He also met Simone, the woman who would become his wife, while overseas in Paris where he married her in 1945. After the war ended, Kent carved out a life as a lawyer and bowling alley owner. Kent's client list working in entertainment and copyright law was an all-star roster with actors like Clayton Moore, who played the Lone Ranger, and Lou Costello of the Abbott and Costello comedy team as well as John Wayne's wife, Pilar Wayne. He also represented screenwriter and playwright Emmet Lavery in a copyright case. He also worked with the dean of the UCLA law school to help admit minority students. He is survived by his wife and daughter, Lynette Kent, as well as a son, Paul Richard Kent, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.","Passed away of pneumonia in Beverly Hills .

"The NYPD has replaced a deputy commissioner who proposed that his officers should be supplied with breath mints to prevent them from swearing and that protesters should be sprayed with baby oil so they could easier to remove. Michael Julian was appointed to the post by police chief Bill Bratton to reform the department following the controversial chokehold death of Staten Island man Eric Garner. He lasted just two months in the post before the decision was made to transfer him to a less controversial position. MIchael Julian, pictured, tried to introduce a number of controversial new training methods within the NYPD following the July 2014 death of Staten Island man Eric Garner who died as he was being arrested . Eric Garner, right, died after he was restrained in a chokehold on Staten Island in July 2014 . Julian was appointed to the NYPD by Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, pictured, after the Garner death . A source told the New York Post: 'He would come up with these wacky ideas. We would roll our eyes and move on.' Julian ordered 10,000 individually wrapped breath mints which were delivered to the NYPD headquarters building. The mints were due to be deployed to individual officers, who would then be instructed to unpeel the wrapper if they felt the urge to swear. Julian believed that by the time the officer had unwrapped the mint and placed it into his mouth, he would no longer want to curse. Earlier he had suggested that police should deploy baby oil in situations when protesters link arms and sit down. He claimed that the baby oil would prevent the protesters from hanging onto each other and officers with rubber gloves could remove them easily. It is understood that Julian was removed from his position as deputy commissioner for training following the gaffes and transferred to the personnel department. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered a review into training within the New York Police Department following the death of father-of-six Eric Garner. Mr Garner died after an NYPD officer placed him in a chokehold during an attempted arrest on Staten Island on July 17, 2014. Officers arrested Mr Garner, who they suspected of selling untaxed cigarettes illegally.","Michael Julian was tasked with improving training within the NYPD .

"A council has been criticised for launching a 'bizarre' appeal for the return of a Nazi flag that went missing from one of its offices. The flag was given to Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after it was taken from an Italian warship sunk by the town's adopted warship HMS Tumult in 1943. It was stored in the town hall until two years ago, when it was moved to nearby Oldbury. But yesterday it emerged the flag has gone missing. Councillors asked the public to help find it so they can put it on display. Labour councillor Ann Shackleton said it was 'a symbol of local people's pride in their community'. A council has been criticised for launching a 'bizarre' appeal for the return of a Nazi flag (not pictured) 'I'm very keen for this historic memorabilia to return to Cradley Heath because it belongs to the people of Rowley Regis,' she said. 'It was largely paid for by public subscription and remains a symbol of local people's pride in their community and their civic identity. 'The flag was just a keepsake do with history and we think it's the sort of thing that gives a clear message when children are learning about the war. 'It's just added interest if we could have displayed it.' Labour councillor John Tipper said he feared the war memorabilia had been lost or stolen. The flag was given to Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after it was taken from an Italian warship sunk by the town's adopted warship HMS Tumult (pictured) in 1943 . He added: 'This Nazi flag is an important part of our history because it was captured from an Italian warship in World War II by sailors from Rowley Regis' adopted warship. 'We want what is left of our hoard back from Oldbury Council House. 'I never thought I'd ever have to say this but to whoever has our Nazi flag can we please can we have it back.' But residents have criticised their appeal saying it is a 'disgrace' and 'a bizarre use of their time'. Bob Gibbins, 44, a local butcher, said: 'Have they not nothing better to do than launch an appeal to find a piece of Nazi memorabilia. 'They are hardly going to run it up the town hall flag pole when they get it back are they, considering what it represents. It was stored in the town hall until two years ago, when it was moved to nearby Oldbury, pictured is the Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council's municipal offices . 'It's just a bit of a bizarre use of their time really.' Mum-of-three Valerie Loxley, 57, added: 'I understand its part of our history but I can't see it being that important to the people of Rowley Regis. 'If I made an appeal to my neighbours for the return of my Adolf Hitler related items I would probably be chased out of the town.' Paul Walker, 34, added: 'There's a war memorial which has gone missing from my kids school but you don't see them appealing to find that. 'Instead they are focusing on the safe return of an item which represents the most evil political party in world history that exterminated six million jews. Its a disgrace really.' Sandwell Council leader Darren Cooper overruled his colleagues and said the flag would never be put on display if it is found because of what it stands for.","Council has appealed for return of Nazi flag that went missing from office .

"Former CIA director James Woolsey said Thursday that President Obama 'looks scared' to called members of Middle Eastern terrorist groups 'Islamic,' just hours after the conclusion of a White House 'Countering VIolent Extremism' summit that studiously avoided pinning terrorism on Islamists. Sitting FBI director James Comey was not invited to the event, but his counterpart from Russia – Aleksandr Bortnikov, the director of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) – attended. The FSB is the post-Soviet successor to the infamous KGB. Woolsey told a CNN audience that Obama 'looks scared. He looks as if he's afraid of using the adjective ""Islamic"" to describe the terrorists' from ISIS, al-Qaeda and other international terror groups bent on mass-murder and global destruction. Scroll down for video . Former CIA director James Woolsey told CNN that President Obama 'looks scared' to describe terrorists as 'Islamic' The White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism at the State Department was a three-day event that put diplomats in the same room as 'community organizers' but never denounced ISIS as an Islamic group . WELCOME COMRADE: Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) director Alexander Bortnikov (right)was welcomes at the State Department despite the White House's stated opposition to incursions into the Ukraine by president Vladimir Putin (center) The president, he said, is the 'world champion of political correctness, and I think that he's let it really run too far here.' The White House pushed back on Friday. Press secretary Josh Earnest said: 'I don't think that the countless terrorists that have been wiped off the battlefield as a result of military action that this president has ordered feel that the president is particularly fearful.' Obama said Thursday during the conference that ISIS and other terror groups 'are desperate for legitimacy, and all of us have a responsibility to refute the notion that (they) somehow represent Islam.' 'That is a falsehood that embraces the terrorist narrative,' the president insisted, saying later that 'the notion that the West is at war with Islam is an ugly lie.' But hours later Woolsey alleged that Obama is not 'taking a stern position in the Middle East and elsewhere, that are causing huge problems.' 'You have to fight effectively – and he's not doing that,' he claimed. And meanwhile, 'ISIS is doing what it is doing, murdering people, burning them alive and trying to expand into a caliphate that covers – has a state – covering the Middle Wast and beyond, in the way it happened in Muhammad's time.' The White House pushed back Thursday against the idea that FBI Director Comey should have been present for the conference's discussions. 'While the FBI works tirelessly to keep the country safe, this conference was not centered on federal law enforcement.,' an Obama administration official told The New York Times. NO ROOM AT FOGGY BOTTOM: FBI Director James Comey was not welcome at the White House conference, but Attorney General Eric Holder did attend . 'The notion that the West is at war with Islam is an ugly lie,' Obama insisted . Woolsey said Obama is the 'world champion of political correctness' and seems 'afraid' to engage ISIS in terms of Islam . The conference, the official said, was premised on the idea that 'community leaders, local law enforcement, private sector innovators, and others' could embrace a 'bottom-up approach' at countering terrorism in American communities. Comey's boss, Attorney General Eric Holder, was present during portions of the event. Officials told the Times that Bortnikov, the Russian spymaster, was sent by the Vladimir Putin regime after the State Department extended an invitation for Russia to send an emissary of its own choosing. 'Bortnikov will inform the participants of the forum about the national system to counter extremism that is functioning in the Russian Federation, stressing the importance of the role of the state in countering the ideology of terrorism,' the FSB said in a statemet earlier in the week.","James Woolsey told a CNN audience that President Obama is the 'world champion of political correctness' and looks 'frightened'

"Disgraced news anchor Brian Williams has resigned from the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation’s board of directors after he was caught lying about his war reporting experiences. Ron Rand, the head of the foundation, put out a very brief statement yesterday saying Williams had resigned, adding that he had been in the position since 2006. The news comes after Williams was banned by NBC from making public appearances while serving a six-month unpaid suspension from the network for false reporting. Williams' name has been trashed in recent weeks after it emerged he lied about being in a helicopter that came under fire while reporting on the Iraq War in 2003. Bob Wright, a personal friend of Williams and the former chairman and CEO of NBC, said the decision was difficult, but NBC believes it was necessary in order to 'get past' the scandal that has besieged Williams. Banned: NBC have told news anchor Brian Williams not to be make any formal public appearances - such as events and speeches - as he sees out a six month suspension over claims of false reporting. Williams is seen here at the LA premiere of the film Neighbors in April 2014 . Tough decision: Bob Wright, NBC's former chairman and CEO, confirmed Williams is not allowed to attend scheduled appearances while he is suspect. The long-time friends are seen here together in 1996 . The decision has lead to a series of cancellations of events that Williams was scheduled to appear, including Palm Beach Civic Association's annual awards luncheon on February, where he was to give the keynote address. 'I feel terrible about it,' Wright told Palm Beach Daily News. 'But life goes on. We'll get past it.' Wright also told the newspaper that Williams is 'considerably restrained' as he deals with the suspension. 'He is just struggling,' Wright said. 'It’s very tough. He is a very people-oriented person. He’d certainly like to get on and explain what he has done and apologize. It’s going to take time.' Williams could lose his job if bosses decide he has brought himself into disrepute after it emerged he falsely claimed he was in a helicopter that came under fire while in Iraq. The foundation is a non-profit organisation which works to promote the Medal of Honor and support projects which encourage the values it represents. Chief among them is integrity. The foundation's website says: 'We believe that the mark of a true hero is to have the moral courage to do what needs to be done because it is the right thing to do.' The other values  are courage, sacrifice, patriotism, citizenship and commitment. A statement on the foundation's website from co-chairmen Jack Jacobs, president Bruce Whitman and CEO Ron Rand simply said: 'Brian Williams has resigned from the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation Board of Directors. 'He had served in that position since September 2006.' An investigation has been launched into his reporting, especially the Iraq incident, which he said happened while covering the war in 2003. The probe is also looking into his reports about seeing a body floating by during Hurricane Katrina and his presence at the fall of the Berlin wall. The 55-year-old faces the possibility of being fired because of a 'morality clause' in his contract that says his role can be terminated if he brings himself into disrepute. Williams, who has been the nightly news anchor for 10 years, had recently signed a $10 million, five-year pact, Page Six reported. The defining clause in his contract said: 'If artist commits any act or becomes involved in any situation, or occurrence, which brings artist into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which justifiably shocks, insults or offends a significant portion of the community, or if publicity is given to any such conduct . . . company shall have the right to terminate.' Weekend anchor Lester Holt has temporarily taken Williams' place. The show has seen a significant drop in viewers since Williams was taken off air. In a statement, NBC chief executive Stephen Burke wrote: 'By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate. His claims came to light after a show was broadcast, featuring Williams describing how in 2003 he had survived his helicopter being shot down by a rocket propelled grenade. His account was challenged by people who were in the actual craft that was hit and it emerged the NBC anchor was in fact in another helicopter entirely, around an hour behind the targeted helicopter. NBC Nightly News Anchor Brian Williams revealed he incorrectly assumed a helicopter he was travelling in had been shot down after it was part of a convoy that made an unscheduled landing in Iraq in 2003 . After the inaccuracies emerged Williams said he made a mistake about being in a Chinook helicopter that was shot down in 2003 because he was scared and in a warzone for the first time. NBC has launched an official probe into Williams, led by Richard Esposito, its top investigative journalist. Williams, who is Managing Editor of the United States' most watched network news program, has remained quiet since the allegations came to light and took himself off the air before he was temporarily suspended. But his silence has not stopped him becoming a figure of ridicule. In an awkward red carpet interview for the 40th anniversary of Saturday Night Live, comedian Jim Carrey asked Today newscaster Matt Lauer  'Where are you hiding Brian Williams?' Jerry Seinfeld also made jokes about the newscaster during the show. Williams (pictured arriving for Letterman's show in 2013) is being investigated by NBC News . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Berlin Wall, 1989 . Tom Brokaw was historically the only American anchor present at the fall of the Berlin Wall. But during a 2008 forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Williams claimed he was at the Brandenburg gate 'the night the wall came down.' And although in a 2004 interview Williams said he arrived at the wall 'a day after -- more like 12 hours after -- Tom Brokaw did,' at a gala in 2014 he stated: '25 years ago tonight Tom Brokaw and I were at the Berlin Wall'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","NBC news anchor Brian Williams has been suspended for six months .

"It is a unique view of the Las Vegas strip - and one that resembles the hit move The Matrix rather than the Hangover, usually associated with the strip. Air force pilots from the US, UK and Australia descended on Las Vegas this week for a military exercise that has run since 1975 to test  tactics, planes and pilots. Called red flag,  this year it included aircraft and personnel from 21 different U.S. military squadrons, as well as the Royal Australian Air Force and the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force. The view from a Royal Australian air force C-130J Super Hercules, assigned to 37 Squadron, Richmond, Australia, lands after a training mission during Red Flag 15-1 at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada on February 9th 2015. Since its establishment in 1975, Red Flag has played host to military units from more than 30 countries. Red Flag is the Air Force's premier air-to-air combat training exercise, and was first run in 1975. Participants often include both US and allied nations' combat air forces. The exercise gives pilots the experience of mulitple, intensive air combat sorties in the safety of a training environment. 'Red Flag still accomplishes the original objective it set out to in 1975,' said Lt. Col. John Stratton, 493rd Fighter Squadron commander. 'It provides realistic training to make our force more survivable in combat.' What makes Red Flag so relevant and important, he said, is that it has evolved commensurate with real world operations and threats. 'Red Flag deliberately incorporates lessons learned from real world operations, past Red Flags, weapons school training, and changes to meet the needs of the combat air forces and the war fighters,' he said. 'They've developed a variety of extremely difficult scenarios that build on each other from day to day so we aren't going out to execute the same mission over and over again.' Those scenarios aren't simply challenges for fighter pilots. Cyber and space operators have been included in the Red Flag exercises for nearly a decade, and Air Force Space Command elements were fully integrated in 2011 at the tactical level, from planning through execution and debrief, according to a 24th Air Force Public Affairs release. Col Brian Dudas, Red Flag 15-1 Air Expeditionary Wing Commander and 48th Fighter Wing Vice Commander, said deployment and defense of assets across each element -- air, space and cyberspace -- is critical to the modern warfighter. 'In the 1970's, when Red Flag began, much of the technology we rely on today was still developing, and wasn't yet part of day-to-day employment,' he said. 'Today, everything overlaps across the domains, and they continue to evolve. Cyber warfare absolutely affects our capabilities, and defense of space in the future will be very important.' Red Flag, Dudas said, is the pinnacle of training environments. Called red flag, this year it included aircraft and personnel from 21 different U.S. military squadrons, including the An F-15 Eagle seen here, as well as the Royal Australian Air Force and the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force. 'When our crews, maintainers, cyber operators, and air operations center and support personnel leave this exercise, they will all have been pushed to their own limits. They will understand just how crucial their own performance and success is to the success of the entire mission,' he said. 'Nowhere else will you find such a coordinated environment to test every aspect of our warfighting capabilities. Nowhere else will you find such a well-trained team dedicated purely to replicating the best of the threats, challenges and issues we may face in combat operations,' he said. Dudas, who has attended nine Red Flags in 20 years, said the ultimate reason we train and operate with our allies at complex flag exercises is to improve our performance and prepare for those real-world operations. 'In today's world, the likelihood of going to combat without our sister services, allies, and partners is almost nil,' he said. 'Therefore, we want to maximize our opportunities to push our own limits alongside those warriors with whom we will fight when called upon.' Dudas said he's seen the level of international integration improve dramatically since his first Red Flag experience as a B-1B co-pilot in 1995. 'We used to spend the entire time trying to figure out how each other spoke, in different terminologies. It took time to learn how to best communicate and interact,' he said. Now we walk in on the same page, ready to fight. We already speak a common tactical language.' The relationships built and strengthened here will pay huge dividends in future combat operations, Dudas said. 'It's that much less time we'll need to spend getting familiar with how we operate separately, he said, 'since we've already done this tough exercise as one cohesive warfighting team.'","Picture taken as part of huge military training exercise in Las Vegas known as Red Flag .

"Britain's biggest power boss claims households will not see a ‘meaningful’ drop in energy bills until next year. Iain Conn, the new chief executive of British Gas’s parent company Centrica, said the group would not pass on the falling cost of energy to customers until 2016. The price of oil has more than halved since last summer, while gas – the main source of electricity in Britain – has dropped by 29 per cent. But power firms have reduced their prices only modestly. Britain's largest power boss claims households will not see a ‘meaningful’ drop in energy bills until next year . British Gas will cut its prices by 5 per cent at the end of this month. EDF has trimmed rates by just 1.3 per cent, while SSE has been ridiculed for refusing to introduce its 4.1 per cent cut until the end of April. Mr Conn, who is on a £3.7 million pay deal at Centrica, said the power giant would not lower prices again because it had bought all of its current energy in advance almost two years ago when prices were much higher. He said that bills ‘will not come down unless energy prices continue to stay down’. It means that power tariffs in 2016 ‘will be much more meaningfully impacted’ by the current fall in prices, he added. This is what critics feared when Ed Miliband pledged to freeze prices for two years if Labour wins power at the election in May. The policy has been widely criticised, and experts say many energy companies would have cut their tariffs sooner if the threat was not in place. Critics have also warned that the move would sap investment from Britain. Yesterday the Centrica group reported a 35 per cent fall in its profits – but still made £1.75 billion last year. British Gas’s profits from supplying households with power fell 23 per cent to £463 million, largely because of warm weather last year and customers switching to smaller suppliers. Almost 400,000 abandoned British Gas during the year. Iain Conn, the new chief executive of British Gas’s parent company Centrica, said the group would not pass on the falling cost of energy to customers until 2016 . Mr Conn said British Gas made an average of £42 profit per customer. The energy regulator Ofgem has previously said the true figure for large energy providers was £114. The Centrica group blamed the falling price of oil and the warm weather for its drop in profits. It took the controversial decision to cut its dividend to shareholders by 30 per cent. This particularly hit its 650,000 small shareholders, many of whom have owned shares since the company was privatised by Margaret Thatcher in 1986. Centrica also said it would cut spending on oil projects in the North Sea by up to 40 per cent. Ann Robinson, consumer policy director at the price comparison website uSwitch dismissed Mr Conn’s defence of his tariffs. She said: ‘If that’s how Centrica are buying and trading their energy then they are quite frankly inefficient.’ Richard Lloyd, executive director at the consumer group Which? said: ‘The modest price cuts have done little to convince consumers that they’ve had the full benefit of a significant shift in wholesale costs.’ Mr Conn’s remarks come only a day after the competition watchdog warned that loyal energy customers were paying too much. The Competition and Markets Authority said that families who stayed on default tariffs paid £234 a year more than those who switch to cheaper rates.","Households will not see a ‘meaningful’ drop in energy bills until next year .

"This is the moment a terrified woman desperately fought for her life as her crazed husband held a knife against her throat. Neighbours watched in horror as drunk Glenn Mills grabbed his wife Susan around the neck and threatened to kill her, a court heard. The terrified mother feared she was going to die at the hands of her jealous husband as he pointed the large kitchen towards her throat and told her: 'If I'm going down I'm going down for something worthwhile.' This was the moment terrified mother Susan Mills was seen on camera fighting for her life as her drunken husband wielded a knife in their back garden . 'Bullying'  Mills had already beaten his wife a month earlier and been banned from their flat in Margate, Kent. But the 48 year old alcoholic returned in July after drinking and Susan complained, telling him: 'Glenn you can't treat me like this.' Mills told her 'Call the police!' and she ran into their garden and shouted to a neighbour to make the 999 call. Prosecutor Dominic Connolly said she then saw Mills emerge carrying a large kitchen knife. Neighbours watched in horror as the knife was pointed towards her throat as she feared she was going to be stabbed to death . He grabbed her around the neck and shouted: 'If I am going down then I am going down for something worthwhile!' Mr. Connolly said: 'He then put the knife to her throat and then her stomach as she pleaded: 'Please don't kill...please someone help!' Glenn Mills grabbed his wife Susan around the neck and threatened to kill her, a court heard . 'She said that she thought she was going to die but managed to get the knife off him and threw it over a fence. 'She then ran into her daughter's bedroom and carried her to a neighbour's house and called the police.' Mr Connolly said the attack was seen by a neighbour who saw Susan being held in a headlock and her husband making stabbing movements towards her face and neck. They said Susan 'looked absolutely terrified' and took the photos on their mobile phone before calling for help. Susan escaped to the neighbour's flat for safety but Mills followed her begging his wife not to press charges. Police arrived within minutes and found Mills sitting on the toilet and 'extremely drunk'. The court heard how Mills had a previous conviction in October 2012 for battery on his wife when he fractured her fingers, telling her later: 'I wish that I had killed you.' Canterbury Crown Court heard that the couple had argued over the parentage of their child. He was originally charged with attempted murder but on the day of his trial pleaded guilty to assault by beating, affray and making threats to kill. Mrs Mills pleaded for her life and shouted to her neighbours for help as Mills put the large kitchen knife to her throat and then her stomach . Drunken bully Glenn Mills grabbed his wife Susan around the neck and told her 'If I'm going down I'm going down for something worthwhile' He was jailed for three years and eight months and the attempted murder charge was left on the file. Oliver Saxby, QC, defending, said: 'The backdrop of these offences is no doubt a tendency to drink too much alcohol and an inability to cope with that a propensity towards nasty and violent behaviour.' He said that since being remanded in prison Mills has taken steps to tackle his alcohol addiction and had started anger management courses. Judge Adele Williams told him: 'These were most unpleasant instances of domestic violence. 'In June last year, while in drink, you punched your wife repeatedly causing a lump to her head and made threats to her. 'You were told not to return to the flat but you did and consumed considerable quantities of alcohol. 'You became violent after arming yourself and attacked your wife leaving her terrified.'","Susan Mills had desperately fought for her life against her husband Glenn .

"A mother-of-two has been shot dead by the police officer she called to help her rid her North Carolina home of unwanted guests. Betty Sexton had called 911, asking officers to come to the home she shared with her boyfriend in Gastonia just before midday on Tuesday. She had hoped the officer, named by authorities as LaDoniqua Neely, would help her make the unwanted guests leave. Shot dead: Betty Sexton (left) had called officers to her home in Gastonia, Carolina, to get help removing unwanted guests. But officer LaDoniqua Neely (right) ended up shooting her dead . Armed: It has emerged Ms Sexton was holding a musket at the time she was shot . But the call-out ended in tragedy, with Ms Sexton being shot in the chest, allegedly by Neely. The 43-year-old later died in hospital. However, it has since emerged Ms Sexton was holding an old musket during the confrontation with police. Her sister Debra Kennedy told WCCB Charlotte she had grabbed it from the closet - although exactly why remains unclear, but it is Ms Sexton believed it was not loaded. The family claim she was in the process of putting the gun down when the officer fired. 'That officer still shot my sister dead in the chest,'  Kennedy told WCCB. Neely, who joined the force in 2012, has been put on administrative while an investigation is carried out. Distraught: Sister Debra Kennedy, seen here talking to local news channel WCCB, said she was putting it down when the fatal bullet was shot by the police officer . This is the second time in two weeks Gastonia's police force has shot someone dead when responding to domestic call outs. On Saturday, February 7, James Howard Allen was killed after refusing to drop the gun he was holding. Firefighters had broken into the 74-year-old's home, concerned he may have been involved in some sort of medical emergency, the Gaston Gazette reported. The police officer in that case was also put on administrative leave - the standard protocol after a firing a fatal shot. Investigation: Officers spent at least six hours going over the scene after Tuesday's shooting . Meanwhile, friends and relatives of Ms Sexton, who has one teenager and a grown-up child, have been paying tribute on social network Facebook. Niece Samantha Kennedy wrote: 'It's not fair. I miss you so much. I dont know how im going to go on without you. I cant let go! 'Please come back.' Bob Kotula, who posted a picture of Ms Sexton, added: 'Betty was a good friend and helper. She will be missed by many.' But others are angry at the police for her death. Louise Harless Kedziora wrote: 'This was so uncalled for. The police officer should have better judgement.'","Betty Sexton was shot in the chest on Tuesday in Gastonia, North Carolina .

"A 73-year-old pensioner has been forced to live in a horse float with no bathroom or kitchen after 13 years of arguing with her local council over plans for her dream retirement home. NSW woman Wendy Bishop, along with her husband, bought a block of land for $30,000 in Cessnock in 2001, after the council put 40 lots up for sale. They hoped to build their perfect home. However, things took an unexpected turn when they found out that the 'For Sale' peg was on the wrong piece of land and they had actually bought a different plot in an unappealing location. Wendy now faces the prospect of spending the rest of her life living in a horse float after the local council made her plans completely unrealistic, imposing harsh restrictions and penalties and leaving her $50,000 in debt. Scroll down for video . 73-year-old Wendy Bishop has been forced to lived in a horse float after an argument with the council over her plot of land . ‘We were sitting here having a cup of tea and he asked us (her neighbour) what we were doing and I said ""we’re clearing our block"" and he said ""I'm sorry this is not your block this is our block"",' Wendy told A Current Affair. The new block of land was at the top of a winding road and had a drainage system running through it, which caused Wendy and her husband a lifetime of heartache. However it was deemed to be a residential piece of land so Wendy and her husband carried on with their plans of building their perfect home. The council didn't make it easy for the elderly couple and five years into their dispute and countless knock backs of their plans, Wendy's beloved husband passed away. ‘They found so many constraints on the land that we were unaware of’, she said. Cessnock council said the roads were too dangerous, the septic tank was not up to scratch and they did not want any vehicles passing over the drainage system. Wendy Bishop, along with her husband, bought a block of land for $30,000 in Cessnock in 2001, after the council put 40 lots up for sale. They hoped to build their perfect home . For Wendy, there is only one solution and that is to live on her land in a horse float, hoping to shame the council into buying the land from her or changing their stringent conditions . There is not kitchen or bathroom in the float, which is smaller than a prison cell . ‘We did everything we could to try and appease them. It took them five years to give me building approval and in that five years they put me through hell', Wendy said. ‘I feel that I’ve tried every avenue over the past 13 years and this is my last resort,' the pensioner said, speaking about her horse float, which is currently parked up outside her rented home. Wendy is not $50,000 in debt and has sold her wedding ring and her beloved pet horse to pay for her expenses. ‘It’s ruined me, it’s definitely ruined me,' she said. ‘I owe the bank I owe everyone I've just tried to keep my head above water.' Now facing an uncertain future, Wendy is furious that the land was ever put on the market and believes it should never have had a dwelling entitlement title because the coucil's conditions could never be satisfied. Interestingly, the council was also bidding for the plot of land at the 2001 auction, hoping to secure the land to make way for road widening. However, Wendy outbid the council and won the land. Speaking to A Current Affair, Cessnock council says it has closed Wendy's file and won’t be reopening it. For Wendy, there is only one solution and that is to live on her land in a horse float, hoping to shame the council into buying the land from her or changing their stringent conditions. There is not kitchen or bathroom in the float, which is smaller than a prison cell. ‘It’s still my land and I’ll live on the bloody thing if I have to,' she said. Things took an unexpected turn when they found out that the 'For Sale' peg was on the wrong piece of land and they had actually bought a different plot in an unappealing location . Wendy is not $50,000 in debt and has sold her wedding ring and her beloved pet horse to pay for her expenses due to her disagreements with Cessnock council (pictured)","A woman has been forced to consider living in a horse float .

"Investigators asked the public Thursday to provide more social media images and eyewitness accounts of a fatal police shooting that has sparked a series of protests in an agricultural community in Washington state. They also asked for patience as they seek more information about the victim, Antonio Zambrano-Montes, an unarmed Mexican man who ran from officers after reportedly throwing rocks at them. Sgt. Ken Lattin of the nearby Kennewick Police Department said videos continue to arrive, and he asked for more contributions from people who saw the February 10 shooting at a busy Pasco intersection. 'The more information we have, the better,' said Lattin, spokesman for the special unit investigating the shooting. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Grief-stricken: Erika Zambrano holds a photo of her father, Antonio Zambrano-Montes, outside the city hall building in Pasco, Washington. His death has sparked major protests and sparked a police investigation . Authorities also are seeking more people who saw Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, in the weeks before the shooting, so they can learn more about his frame of mind, Lattin said at a news conference. Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest against the police. Residents marched and staged 'die-ins' throughout Pasco. The 35-year-old's death was caught on a witness's cellphone being gunned down by officers at a busy intersection, sparking outrage across  the United States and Mexico. It is the fourth fatal shooting by police in the city in the last six months and has caused heightened tensions within the community. Zambrano-Montes recently spent some time in a homeless shelter, authorities said Thursday. But investigators have been unable to interview anyone who saw him in the two weeks leading up to his death, Lattin said. In addition, officers are seeking to learn if Zambrano-Montes had mental problems, Lattin said. 'His actions were not normal,' Lattin said. 'It was not reasonable behavior. We want to know why.' In response to questions about whether the special investigative team could be objective in evaluating Pasco officers' conduct, Lattin was emphatic: 'We are going to produce an impartial report. No investigators would put their careers in jeopardy for someone else.' Reaction: Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Pasco, Washington, to protest the death of Antonio Zambrano-Montes. He was shot and killed by police after allegedly throwing stones at them . Necessary: Family members and supporters have questioned why the 35-year-old wasn't shot in the legs and was instead dealt a fatal blow . Running away? Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, is captured on witness Dario Infante's cellphone just seconds before he is shot dead by police. He appears to be running away from officers in the Washington city of Pasco . Shooting: The orchard worker, who was born in Mexico, had allegedly been throwing rocks at police. He is pictured turning to face three armed officers as one holds up a flashlight and two others draw their guns . That wasn't good enough for Felix Vargas, a Pasco business leader who has asked the federal government to conduct its own probe of the shooting. 'We want a separate set of investigatory eyes to come to Pasco,' Vargas said. He said it's inappropriate for authorities from such a close jurisdiction to be investigating a case that has drawn nationwide attention. Pasco police say Zambrano-Montes hit two officers with rocks and refused to put down other stones. In a cellphone video from a witness, several 'pops' are audible just before Zambrano-Montes is seen running across a street, pursued by three officers. As he stops and turns around, gunshots ring out, and he falls dead. Lattin said investigators have determined all three officers involved discharged their weapons. But he couldn't say how many bullets were fired. He added it was unclear from the video if Zambrano-Montes had anything in his hand when he was shot. The three officers are on paid administrative leave. None of them was wearing a body camera, Lattin said. But authorities are looking at dash cam video from patrol cars. Investigators have interviewed about 40 people, but only a few actually saw the shooting. Killed: Zambrano-Montes is seen lying on the ground after he was shot by police on February 10 . Protesting: Protesters gather at the corner where the shooting of Zambrano-Montes took place . Lattin also said it was not yet clear if Zambrano-Montes was in the country legally, but that it didn't matter as far as investigators were concerned. 'We treat all individuals the same regardless of any legal status that they may have had,' investigators said in a release. The special investigations unit does not include officers from Pasco, a southeast Washington town of about 70,000. More than half of Pasco's population is Hispanic. The killing was the fourth by Pasco police in less than a year and has led to protests. Officers were exonerated after similar investigations in the first three cases. Critics in the latest case say the officers should have used less than lethal force to subdue Zambrano-Montes. Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant, who ultimately will decide if charges are brought against the officers, said the victim's family has requested a private autopsy. He also said witnesses who might be in the country illegally can speak with investigators without fear of being deported. The investigation is likely to take months, and Lattin urged calm. 'We appreciate the patience of the public,' he said. Memorial: Pasco residents, pictured from left,  Angel Morgan, five, and his brother Jose Morgan, six, and Alex Gonzalez, four, and his brother Angel Gonzalez, eight, gather around a candlelit vigil on February 11 . Scene: Police investigate the scene of the shooting at the intersection of 10th Avenue and Lewis Street . The death of Zambrano-Montes is the fourth fatal police shooting since last summer in Pasco. It has sparked protests after witnesses said he was running away when he was shot in a busy intersection. Witness Ben Patrick told the Tri-City Herald that police fired at the man as his back was turned. 'I really thought they were just going walk up and tackle or Taser him,' he said. 'But they opened fire. His back was turned.' Patrick's wife, Shannon, also said the man was running away. The shooting happened in front of her young children. 'He turned around to take off running and the cops just shot him,' she said. Other witnesses heard officers give Zambrano-Montes orders to stop and drop the rock. They said the man refused to listen. Zambrano-Montes, who was raised in Michoacan, Mexico, has lived for about a decade in Pasco, where more than half of the residents are Hispanic. He died of gunshot wounds to the torso. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday reiterated his country's 'condemnation of the disproportionate use of lethal force' by members of the Pasco police against a Mexican citizen. 'I have directed the secretary of foreign relations to support his family so they feel the backing and support of the government of Mexico, so they don't feel alone and so there is a close monitoring of the investigation into this regrettable and outrageous occurrence,' he said at a gathering of members of the foreign diplomatic corps in Mexico City. Zambrano-Montes was not armed with either a gun or a knife, Lattin confirmed at the news conference, but whether he had a rock in his hand when he was shot is still under investigation. Paying tribute: Laura Alvarado, who says she knew Zambrano-Montes, lights a candle next to Vinny's Bakery . Zambrano-Montes had a run-in with Pasco police early last year, having been arrested for assault after throwing objects at officers and trying to grab an officer's pistol, court records show. Lattin cautioned the public that the inquiry will take at least weeks and that any decision on whether to bring charges against the three officers involved will be made by the Franklin County prosecutor. The officers are on paid administrative leave. 'Those three officers are going to have to live by their decisions,' Lattin said. 'Was it right? That will come out later on.' Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant said it was too early to speculate about what charges potentially could be brought against the officers. 'Rest in peace': Melted candle wax, a rock and roses are part of an impromptu memorial for  Zambrano-Montes on the sidewalk in Pasco, Washington . The Pasco police department also is conducting an administrative investigation of the shooting and could punish the officers if they find they disobeyed department procedures of policies. Local officials have been in contact with state and federal officials, who are observing the local criminal investigation and decide later whether any further action needs to be taken, Lattin said. Zambrano-Montes' family's $2 million damages claim was filed by his widow and two daughters. It is a precursor to a lawsuit. The city has 60 days to respond. The group conducting the criminal investigation was formed in 2010 to look at any officer-involved criminal cases. This is the eleventh investigation they have conducted since then, Lattin said. In three previous fatal police shootings in Pasco, prosecutors cleared officers with the Pasco Police Department and a sheriff's deputy who was working on a regional SWAT team. One of the three officers involved in Tuesday's shooting was a defendant in a federal civil-rights lawsuit the city settled in 2013 for $100,000, according to court records. The lawsuit claimed Pasco officers were inadequately trained in the use of force and how to respond to street confrontations. Earlier this week, the ACLU of Washington also issued a statement, calling the incident 'very disturbing.' The group's executive director, Kathleen Taylor said: 'Fleeing from police and not following an officer's command should not be sufficient for a person to get shot,' She added deadly force should be used only as a last resort.","Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, shot dead by police on February 10 .

"Angry at her Nascar rival for apparently spinning her off the track for a second time in two days, Danica Patrick certainly let Denny Hamlin know about it when she confronted him after a qualifying race. The pair were involved in a heated argument in which she accused the Joe Gibbs Racing driver of spinning her off the track during the 150 mile race before Sunday's Daytona 500. Patrick needed to finish 15th or better to guarantee a spot  and managed to come in 10th despite the setback. A furious Danica Patrick (right) calls out Denny Hamlin after the pair had a coming together during the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Budweiser Duel 2 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida . Patrick, in car 10, span off track after being sent sideways by the incident with Hamlin seconds before . She was not happy with her fellow driver, telling him straight 'you got on my left rear and spun me out' Hamlin eventually clasped his head in his hands as Patrick refused to accept his explanation for the spin . But she wasn't about to let Hamlin of the hook as, with cameras rolling, she marches over to Hamlin, grasps him by his race suit and makes her feelings clear in front of dozens of closely packed onlookers post race on Thursday. The two had already been involved in an incident in practice the day before where Patrick accused Hamlin of the very same thing. In yesterday's confrontation over the dangerous high speed smash, she berated him furiously, saying: 'What are you doing, seriously? You did the same thing in practice. 'You get on my left rear and it spins me out. 'Don't be up my a** on my left corner again.' Hamlin replied: 'Nobody has your back like I do but I can't give you an extra two feet because it's you.' The heated argument continued, with Hamlin try to calm Patrick, who stares him out intensely while he makes his case. He holds out his hands in a conciliatory gesture and grasps Patrick round the shoulders at times, but there is no placating her and Hamlin finally seems exasperated and covers his face with his hands. Hamlin tried to tell Patrick the problem was with her car's aerodynamics but sh was having none of it . The spin left Patrick fighting to finish high enough to qualify for the 500, but she still managed to do so . Patrick told Hamlin: 'You did the same thing, nobody else left me with a problem out there' 'He cut across my rear bumper and pulls the back end around,' Patrick said. 'I don't want to have these issues, but if we're going to have these issues then we're going to have to deal with them. 'We can't be putting ourselves out of our race at someone else's expense and nothing's happened to him.' Tony Stewart, her team co-owner, entered the fray and instructed Hamlin to watch the video. 'What do you want me to do Tony, not race close?' replied Hamlin, adamant that Patrick's car was too loose and he didn't make contact. He maintained the spin was caused by aerodynamics, not contact. 'I try to treat everyone as equal,' Hamlin said. 'If you're in this Cup series, you deserved your way here and you can handle a lot of situations. 'I just got close to her and her car got loose again. I just tried to explain that, ""Danica, oh, it's you, I've got to stay away two feet because your car is loose?"" 'I guess I just have to give more room because once I get close enough to her, her car just gets out of control.' After the crash Patrick's Stewart-Haas Racing team worked frantically on rapid repairs and she restarted 18th with two laps to go. She was pushed all the way around Daytona International Speedway by teammate Kurt Busch to finish high enough to make the main event on Sunday.","Danica Patrick involved in a heated argument with Joe Gibbs Racing driver .

"An attention hungry raven is on the loose and flew right in front of a camera filming the home of the San Francisco 49ers, Levi's Stadium. The NFL stadium in Santa Clara, California is being turned into an outdoor hockey rink for an NHL game on Saturday between the San Jose Sharks and the Los Angeles Kings and is undergoing a serious makeover. The stadium staff hoped to film the transformation by 200 workers over the past few days and was visited by one very menacing raven in the process. Who you lookin' at?: This raven photobombed a camera filming the transformation of Levi's Stadium into an ice rink for a game between the San Jose Sharks and the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday . Open wide: The raven opens its beak to perhaps express its enthusiasm about the upcoming NHL game in and NFL stadium home to the San Francisco 49ers . That's no ice rink! Levi's Stadium in Santa, Clara California home to the San Francisco 49ers, pictured as a football stadium, will be an NHL ice rink on Saturday night . After noticing the plucky bird on film, those responsible for filming the stadium preparation took the footage of the bird and added some ominous music in the background which made for a humorous video posted to YouTube that already has over 500,000 views. In the chirpy film, the raven ruffles his feathers a few times and lets out a few strong, 'cacaws!' before flying away into the infinite sky perhaps only to return when thousands of fans fill the seats. Raven or no raven, the game between the Sharks and the Kings will occur at 7 p.m. on Saturday night as part of the 2015 Coors Light NHL Stadium Series. Since some 70,000 spectators along with one bird are expected at the game, extra seating has been added to the already magnanimous stadium. The L.A. Times reports that this is the second outdoor games for the Kings. The team lost 3-0 to the Anaheim Ducks in January of last year. Fly by appearance: The raven flies off into the infinite sky to allow the camera to finish filming video of the stadium as it prepares for Saturday's game . Even more fans: The often busy stadium is expecting 70,000 fans on Saturday night so extra seating has been added to make room for spectators and avian guests .","An attention hungry raven is on the loose and flew right in front of a camera filming Levi football Stadium home to the San Francisco 49ers .

"DAVID Cameron was under further pressure last night to tackle the scandal of Shaker Aamer’s incarceration after a fellow Guantanamo inmate had his terror conviction quashed by a US court. Supporters of 48-year-old Mr Aamer, who has been held in the camp for 13 years without charge or trial, said action was imperative after David Hicks – nicknamed the ‘Aussie Taliban’ – had his guilty plea overturned. Hicks, who was the first of just six prisoners convicted of offences at the base in Cuba, admitted in 2007 to providing material support to terrorism – a deal which allowed him to return home to Australia. Prisoner: Guantanamo Bay detainee Shaker Aamer, pictured with his son Michael (right) and daughter Johninh, has been held without trial in Guantanamo Bay for the past 13 years . The 39-year-old has since insisted he only pleaded guilty after being subjected to stress positions, sensory deprivation and music played extremely loud. The US Court of Military Commission Review struck out the conviction on Wednesday, saying the charge had not become a crime until years after he was captured. Last night campaigners said the Hicks case highlighted the plight endured by Mr Aamer who has twice been cleared for release – first by the Bush administration in 2007 and again by Barack Obama in 2009. They urged Downing Street to renew pressure on the White House to keep the promise to free the father-of-four, who lived in South London with his wife and children. Cori Crider of legal charity Reprieve and Mr Aamer’s lawyer, said: ‘It is increasingly hard to understand why the affront to justice that is Guantanamo Bay remains open. Tortured but released:  David Hicks was captured in 2001 and pleaded guilty to terror crimes in 2007 in order to be able to return to Australia . Aamer's family is urging Cameron to pressure the White House to keep the promise to free him . ‘The overwhelming majority of people held there have never even been given a trial. Among them is Shaker, who has never been charged and continues to be held despite having been cleared for release by the US government. ‘David Cameron’s requests for Shaker to be released back home to the UK so far seem to have fallen on deaf ears – he must now redouble his efforts.’ Hicks travelled to Afghanistan in 1999, where he attended al-Qaeda training camps and met Osama Bin Laden. In late 2001, he was captured and handed to the US. Pleading guilty allowed him to return home to Australia where he served only nine months of a seven-year sentence. John Howard, Australia’s prime minister while Mr Hicks was in Guantanamo Bay, described the US decision on his verdict as a technicality, adding: ‘Nothing alters the fact that by his own admission, Hicks trained with al-Qaeda [and] met Osama Bin Laden.’ Saudi-born Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and married, securing leave to remain in Britain. In 2001, he was detained in Kabul while carrying out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity, his representatives claim.","Shaker Aamer has been twice cleared for release by US authorities .

"A restaurant owner has been left stumped after his local council threatened to fine him for not holding an advertising permit, despite the local authority failing to issue them or direct him to somewhere that does. Bill Cobb, who owns Billy's On The Bay in Margate, 26km north of Brisbane, told Daily Mail Australia that he had been attaching a sign to the tow bar of his car for the last seven and a half years. 'The sign slides into my tow bar, only when I'm at work, and has an arrow pointing to the restaurant,' Bill Cobb was advised by his local council to remove the pictured sign or risk receiving a fine due to not holding a permit. However the council said they did not issue permits or direct him to somewhere that did . 'I'm under a motel so you could drive right past without even noticing me.' Despite the fact that Mr Cobb has been displaying the sign since June 10 in 2008, he said he was approached by a ranger from the Moreton Bay Regional Council who told him he had to take it down. 'We're at a dead end,'a confused Mr Cobb, who had been displaying the sign since June 10 in 2008, said . 'She said: ""If you don't take it off I'm going to have to give you a warning and you'll get a fine"",' Mr Cobb said. 'She said it's against the law and I need a permit for the sign, but they don't issue permits.' Mr Cobb then contacted the Main Roads Department and the local police about where he could obtain a permit for the ad, both of which referred him back to his local council. 'They said it's up to council because it's their local area, but they won't issue a permit. So, we're at a dead end,' he said. The business owner has since been forced to remove the sign permanently as the fines range between $227 and $2260. A Moreton Bay Regional Council spokesman told Daily Mail Australia the signage did not comply with council’s local laws for advertising signage or the Queensland Government’s Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act. 'The Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act states road corridors cannot be used for the purposes of advertising without a permit’ the spokesperson said quoting a legislation which added: ‘unless the person is the holder of a permit issued by the chief executive or commissioner authorising the person so to do'. When asked by Daily Mail Australia whom the chief executive or commissioner issuing permits was or where a resident could find them to apply for a permit, the spokesperson was unable to give a response. He repeated that the sign did not comply with council laws and that a permit would not be issued. A Moreton Bay Regional Council spokesperson, which looks after the area of Margate where Mr Cobb's restaurant is based, said the sign would not be given a permit because it doesn't comply with council laws .","Bill Cobb has been displaying a sign directing people to his restaurant for the last seven and a half years .

"Teenager Lucie Low is doubled over in agonising pain every day after being diagnosed with a rare digestive disorder . Doubled over in pain, teenager Lucie Low suffers pain so agonising it feels as though she is in labour. But the 13-year-old is not expecting a baby. When she first went to see doctors, they put her pain down to constipation. But Lucie is not constipated. After enduring months of agony, Lucie was admitted to hospital last month. There doctors discovered she was suffering from a rare digestive disorder. The condition, superior mesenteric arterial syndrome, is caused when the duodenum - part of the small intestine - is compressed between two arteries, which can cause it to become blocked. Such is the rarity of the illness, that Lucie's local NHS hospital are struggling to find a specialist to treat the teenager. After six weeks of watching her daughter battle the pain, Lucie's mother Zoe is today trying to raise enough money to pay for a private specialist. The 36-year-old, said: 'Lucie is in pain 24/7. She is so distressed. She is crying and screaming out my name. 'The only way to describe it is like she is in labour, she is doubled over. 'I have had to see my beautiful 13-year-old daughter go from being a normal teenage girl to not being able to get out of bed. 'She usually loves school and she really misses her friends. She is a real bookworm but she isn't even able to read because she is in so much pain.' In a video uploaded to a fundraising page, Lucie whimpers in pain and says 'I can't take it no more' and later 'I can't take it mummy'. The mother-of-two, added: 'I feel helpless, I'm desperate for her to get the help she needs. I set up a page on Facebook as a last resort, just to see if I could get any help. 'I have spoken to so many consultants and been to the patient advice and liaison service and the nurses are doing everything they can but it is not getting us anywhere.' Lucie, from Rainham, Kent, began suffering stomach problems last August when she started getting pain every time she ate. The pain got worse from October and she lost more than two stone in weight. Doctors initially diagnosed constipation and sent her home before she was eventually admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital for tests. Lucie went there for an exploratory procedure and was told she would be there for two days, but she ended up 'doubled over in pain' and stayed for 10 days. Lucie, pictured with her mother Zoe and brother Tom, has been in and out of hospital since last month as doctors try to find the best form of treatment for her . Her mother Zoe, has started to raise money, in the hope of being able to pay for Lucie, pictured left before going into hospital, and right in hospital, to see a private specialist . She was then transferred to Medway Maritime Hospital and has been on the children's ward since - apart from a couple of days earlier this month when she was well enough to go home. Zoe says Lucie is only being given pain relief and the hospital do not have the specialists needed to treat her. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a rare condition. It occurs when the duodenum - part of the small intestine - is compressed between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. The compression causes the duodenum to become blocked, which causes acute pain. It is known to be a complication of scoliosis surgery, anorexia, and trauma. Doctors have contacted a number of other hospitals but so far not found Lucie the help she needs. Ms Low said doctors at GOSH are waiting for the results of some more tests, adding she is 'frustrated' by the delay. She added: 'She has been in this level of pain for about 18 days now and it is constant, 24 hours a day. 'I originally set up the Facebook page to find help. It wasn't about money, I just got desperate and wanted somebody to help treat her.' A Medway Maritime Hospital spokesman said they are doing all they can for the family. He said: 'The paediatric team at Medway Maritime Hospital are doing everything possible to care for Lucie and to support her family. 'Unfortunately, we are unable to discuss individual patient cases, so cannot provide any further comment at this stage.' In just 24 hours Lucie's family and friends have raised more than £2,000.","Lucie Low, 13, has been diagnosed with a rare digestive disorder .

"A life-sized cocaine-snorting Oscar statue was displayed on Hollywood Boulevard just days before the street will be filled with glamorous stars for the Academy Awards. Los Angeles-based artist who calls himself Plastic Jesus placed his public art at the end of Hollywood Boulevard on Thursday, right where the street is expected to close for Sunday's awards ceremony. His statue was removed as official Academy Award statues were being put up in almost the same location. The fiberglass statue - on its hands and knees holding a rolled $100 bill and facing two lines of what looks like cocaine - rests atop a platform that has its own red carpet and a plaque that reads, 'Hollywood's Best Party'. Los Angeles-based artist Plastic Jesus placed his life-sized cocaine-snorting Oscar statue at the end of Hollywood Boulevard on Thursday, right where the street is expected to close for Sunday's awards ceremony . The fiberglass statue - on its hands and knees holding a rolled $100 bill and facing two lines of what looks like cocaine - rests atop a platform that has its own red carpet and a plaque that reads, 'Hollywood's Best Party' A statement accompanied the public art and was written by photographer Nick Stern, who works with Plastic Jesus, according to Flavor Wire. Stern said the piece comment's on 'Hollywood's hidden problem of drug addiction that effects hundreds of people in the showbiz industry and is largely ignored until a death of a high-profile A-list celebrity'. Hours after the statue was displayed on Thursday, Harris Wittels, the co-executive producer of NBC's Parks and Recreation, was found dead from apparent drug overdose just after saying he was clean. Cocaine is as big of an issue in the world, Plastic Jesus told New York Daily News. 'The piece is really just to show how much a part of everyday life for people cocaine is,' Plastic Jesus said. 'In the current war on drugs, this isn't working. The term controlled substance is an absolutely joke' 'We're deluded if we're saying that cocaine isn't a major part of Hollywood and almost every other city in the world,' he said. 'A lot of people will sit down and watch the Oscar show this Sunday and then go and indulge in cocaine.' The artist said he wanted to 'create controversy' about the issue and plans to place the statue on Melrose Avenue the day of the Academy awards. 'The piece is really just to show how much a part of everyday life for people cocaine is,' he told New York Daily News. 'In the current war on drugs, this isn't working. The term controlled substance is an absolutely joke. There is absolutely no control.' This isn't the artist's first Oscar stunt. Last year he created a Oscar Statue injecting heroin, with a plaque reading 'Hollywood's Best Kept Secret' After the statue was taken down on Thursday afternoon, crew members for the Academy Awards swarmed the area to set up for the big night .

"Indonesia's Attorney-General has said the Bali Nine pair's execution should take place 'the sooner the better'- as the country's president put the delay down to a 'technical issues'. Despite the delay, which saw Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's slated move to Nusakambangan Island on Tuesday halted, President Joko Widodo has insisted that that their killings will go ahead as planned. President Widodo told Indonesian media on Friday afternoon that it was the nation's 'legal sovereignty,' and that the postponement was 'only about technical matters'. Scroll down for video . Indonesian President Joko Widodo has claimed that 'technical issues' were to blame for the postponement . Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo corroborated the claims, explaining that isolation rooms and executions fields on the island were not ready for the pair, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. 'We actually think the sooner the better,' Mr Prasetyo said. The reason was later disputed by officials on Nusakambangan island, following claims that the families of Chan and Sukumaran were entitled to more time with the pair. On Thursday, Husain Abdullah, the spokesman for Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, said the execution of the drug smugglers 'will be delayed for between three weeks to a month from now due to technical reasons.' Jusuf Kalla took a phone call on Thursday afternoon from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who reportedly thanked his government for delaying the men's transfer to the execution site on Kambangan island. The news comes after senior government figures expressed concerns Mr Abbott had derailed efforts to save the Bali Nine duo from execution by making comments taken as a 'threat' by Indonesia. The Indonesian President reportedly didn't know about the rehabilitation of Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) The executions of Andrew Chan (L) and Myuran Sukumaran who are on death row in Indonesia for drug smuggling have been delayed . Ms Bishop has been leading a carefully crafted campaign to spare the lives of Australians Sukumaran and Chan, exercising caution in pointing out problems with Indonesia's legal system while remaining respectful, Fairfax reported. But on Wednesday, Mr Abbott linked the men's fate to Australia's donation of $1 billion in aid following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami that killed more than 200,000 in Indonesia, and suggested the Asian country should 'reciprocate in this way at this time'. President Widodo told local media that Ms Bishop had clarified the remarks, speaking directly with Vice-President Jusuf Kalla. She has explained that it wasn't the intention. Actually we wanted to say something but since it has been explained, we cancelled it,' said Widodo. Ms Bishop told The Sydney Morning Herald that she had informed Mr Kalla that the comments were not intended as a threat, and were instead an indication of the long friendship between Australia and Indonesia. 'I said I regretted if this comment was seen as anything other than that,' she said. Indonesia's pledge to proceed with the execution of the Australians -- just two of seven foreigners on death row whose appeals for presidential clemency have been rejected -- has strained ties between Jakarta and Canberra, a relationship only just recovering from a damaging rift in 2014 over spying revelations and people-smuggling. Senior government figures were concerned Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) had derailed efforts to save the Bali Nine duo, after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's (right) carefully crafted campaign to spare their lives . President of Indonesia Joko Widodo and Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott. The news comes after senior Cabinet members expressed their concern at Mr Abbott's recent comments about the men's executions . The comments had previously sparked a sharp rebuke from the Indonesian government, with the country's foreign affairs ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, hitting back by saying 'no one responds well to threats'. Senior members of the Abbott government slammed the prime minister's comments as 'awful'. 'It undid a lot of the good work,' a source told Fairfax . Ahmad Yuspahruddin, chief of the Indonesian Justice Ministry's Central Java penitentiary division which governs the prisons on Kambangan island told Daily Mail Australia today that preparations were in place to put the two Australians to death by firing squad. 'Nothing problem, everything is okay here,' Mr Yuspahruddin said, 'Whenever the Bali nine duo will be coming we have prepared it for some days ago. We are waiting for them.' Chan and Sukumaran are enjoying a few days' reprieve from the firing squad after Indonesia was caught unprepared for the executions and delayed moving them from their Bali jail cells . Tony Spontana, a spokesman for the attorney-general's office which oversees the executions, neither confirmed nor denied the statement from the vice president's office but insisted the prisoners would eventually face the firing squad. 'What needs to be underscored is the execution will still be conducted,' Spontana told AFP. Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo said a date for the transfer had not been set because more co-ordination was needed and he didn't think Mr Kalla would have given a timeframe. 'I've never said that and I don't think the vice president would have said that,' Mr Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta. 'He only leaves it all to us because when a sentence already has final, legally binding status and all legal (appeal) aspects have been fulfilled, the execution is the prosecutor's obligation and responsibility.' At Kerobokan jail on Friday, meetings to plan the transfer to Nusa Kambangan jail continued, but no date was set. 'As soon as Nusa Kambangan is ready, we'll send them immediately,' Bali chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso told reporters. 'Everything is ready for execution - we are waiting for them': The 'death island' prisons boss Ahmad Yuspahruddin (pictured), chief of the Central Java penitentiary division which governs Nusakambangan Island is prepared to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Condemned men: Myuran Sukumaran (pictured in a Bali holding cell) Mr O'Connell says it's a strong case, but lawyers will first have to clear jurisdictional hurdles - whether Mr Joko's decree can be characterised under administrative law or is simply a decision that's a matter for the president. At the same time, the lawyers' complaints against the original six judges in the Bali Nine pair's trial are being examined. Indonesia's judicial commission has contacted the lawyers for more information about their concerns, which came after the original lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran alleged 'interference' that saw the Australians sentenced to death instead of life for the 2005 drug-smuggling bid. Mr O'Connell said the Sydney men were coping extremely well. 'They're humbled really by the depth of support that has been coming from Australia and to some extent in Indonesia as well,' he said on Thursday. 'They are very grateful for it and they simple wait and hope.","Chan and Sukumaran were slated for transfer to death island on Tuesday .

"Call to action: The Prime Minister said today that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon had made it clear she was 'up for a coalition' with the Labour party . David Cameron warned Scots that a vote for any party other than the Conservatives would let Ed Miliband into Downing Street - and allow Alex Salmond back into a position of power. The Prime Minister said today that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon had made it clear she was 'up for a coalition' with the Labour party  in the event of a hung parliament. He added this would lead to the 'very real prospect' of Alex Salmond, who is standing for election as an MP for the Scottish nationalists this May, having the 'decisive say' in the running of the country. Mr Cameron told the Scottish Conservative conference: 'If you vote for anyone else apart from the Conservatives you are voting for this outcome: Labour in government. Ed Miliband in Downing Street ... and the very real prospect of Alex Salmond coming in through the back door.' On the return of Mr Salmond, who is standing for election in Gordon, Mr Cameron said that 'like a horror movie, he's back'. The Prime Minister added: 'Only this time he's not running Scotland. He would have the decisive say in running a country he wants to see abolished, our United Kingdom.' He said it was 'appalling' that Labour and Mr Miliband had failed to rule out doing a deal with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament, branding them 'spineless, weak, unprincipled, short-termist'. He told the conference: 'That is all anyone needs to know about today's Labour Party.' He added the Conservatives were the 'bedrock' of the pro-UK campaign in the run-up to last September's Scottish independence referendum. But after 'battling' to keep the United Kingdom together, he warned that there was still a threat to Scotland's future from the prospect of a Labour government. He told the conference 'a major risk to Scotland's future remains' from the economic policies of Labour if Ed Balls succeed in becoming the chancellor after the election. He said: 'We fought to stop the risk of break-up. Now we have to fight to stave off the risk of bankruptcy.' He hit out at the economic policies of Labour and the SNP, telling the conference: 'Our opponents bleat on about ""austerity"" but I tell you - if we don't grip these debts, they will grip us. 'And there will be less and less money for our schools, hospitals, communities, pensions - for everything that makes life worthwhile.' After Ms Sturgeon made a speech in London where she blasted Conservative spending cuts as 'morally unjustifiable', Mr Cameron hit back at the SNP leader. Decisive say: Cameron said if Labour was to come into power it would lead to the 'very real prospect' of Alex Salmond, right, having the 'decisive say' in the running of the country. Left, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon . 'I'll tell you what is ""morally unjustifiable"", First Minister. And that is racking up more debt than our children and grandchildren could ever hope to re-pay. 'Passing the buck like every other hopeless left-wing administration in history. 'And that's why it will be us - the Conservative Party - who will do the right thing, clear up this mess - and leave Scotland standing taller.' The economic policies his party has pursued means 'we'll be able to look our children and grandchildren in the eye and know we did the right thing'. In his speech today, Mr Cameron also defended the introduction of the benefits reforms introduced by the Government, saying: 'We came in with a mission to restore the right values. 'No more something for nothing. No more taking without contributing. Above all - work must always pay. That's what the benefit cap is about. That's what Universal Credit is about. And it's working.' In a rallying cry Mr Cameron spoke about the country's spirit which 'really makes Britain special'. He also praised aid workers such as Pauline Cafferkey, who contracted Ebola while volunteering in Africa, speaking about their 'spirit of compassion'. The Prime Minister told the conference: 'That is Britain. No other country on earth has this combination of guts and grit, heart and brains. 'And no other country on earth is such a powerful example of how people of all different faiths and beliefs and nationalities can live together. 'None of us are just English, or Scottish, or Welsh. Or a Londoner or a Glaswegian, or West Indian or Asian. We're all British too. 'That's what we are - all of us, whatever our background, wherever we're from. We're all British. Warning: Mr Cameron, pictured today, said the Tories had 'battled' to keep the United Kingdom together, but warned that there was still a threat to Scotland's future from the prospect of a Labour government . 'And our goal in this party is to show people, over the coming weeks and months and years - how we take these ingredients and make our country an even better place to live.' But SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie said: 'The Tories have been rejected in election after election in Scotland, and only a strong team of SNP MPs will be able to exert power at Westminster on behalf of the people of Scotland - standing up for Scottish interests, and opposing the Tory obsession with austerity. 'The Tories are right to be concerned that a strong SNP vote will stand in the way of their damaging agenda - a poll earlier this month showed that people in Scotland are backing the SNP to keep the Tories out of office.' Mr Cameron was also in Scotland to announce the backing of Scottish shipbuilding with an £859million investment in the next generation of Royal Navy frigates to be built on the River Clyde.

"The body of an elderly woman who was mysteriously murdered along with her husband last year was weighed down with cement blocks before it was thrown into a Georgia lake, it has emerged. Shirley and Russell Dermond, who had been married 62 years, were both killed at their Lake Oconee home the weekend of May 2, 2014 - but police still do not know who was responsible. Neighbors, concerned they had not seen the couple, went to their home on May 6 and found Mr Dermond's decapitated body in their garage. His wife was nowhere to be seen. Her body was eventually found on May 16 by fishermen at a lake, about five miles away by water from their waterfront home. Killed: Shirley and Russell Dermond were killed at their Lake Oconee, Georgia home last May and their killer has still not been found. Mr Dermond was decapitated while Mrs Dermond's body was dumped in a lake . Police have long said they do not believe the killer or killers wanted Mrs Dermond's body to be found and, speaking to WSB-TV, they said it is because her body had been weighed down by the blocks. She had two four-inch cap blocks on her body, but the killers must not have anticipated the effect of decomposing gases beneath the skin, which make a body more buoyant. Police have tried to find where the blocks were bought but unfortunately they're 'as common as ketchup,' Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills told WSB-TV. Still, the body has given them potentially significant evidence that can be checked against a suspect when one is found. Heartbreaking: The body of Mrs Dermond was weighed down with cement blocks before it was dumped . '(There's) a lot more to work with when you have the body,' said FBI Special Agent Steve Emmett. 'Whatever Putnam feels that they need from the FBI, we will be there for them.' The case has baffled police, relatives and members of the quiet community. Autopsies showed that the couple died of head wounds, but it is not known how they were attacked, by whom or why. Mr Putnam's head remains missing. No one reported hearing any commotion over the weekend they are believed to have died. Nothing was taken from their $1 million home and their car keys and cellphones were left behind. Video cameras at the guard house at the entrance to the subdivision weren't working, and it is possible the killer came by boat. The 19,000-acre lake offered countless entry and escape routes. Bizarre: Nothing had been stolen from the couple's $1 million waterfront home and no commotion was heard . Escape route: The killer or killers likely escaped on the water after the May 2014 attack . While investigators scoured the Dermond house and areas around it for evidence in the days after the grisly discovery, whatever they collected has yet to render a clue. Russell Dermond, 88, had retired from corporate life - much of it with clockmaking companies - in the late 1980s to run a chain of Atlanta-area Hardee's restaurants. About 15 years ago, he and his wife, Shirley, 87, moved to Lake Oconee to live out their years in the golf-course community in a waterfront home. The 3,200-square-foot, $1 million home sits in a tree-shrouded cul-de-sac in the Great Waters subdivision, a dozen or so miles northeast of Eatonton. See below for video .","Russell and Shirley Dermond, who had been married 62 years, were savagely murdered at their Georgia lakefront home last May .

"Donald Trump has withdrawn a lawsuit he just filed against city officials in a Miami suburb over noise-ordinance violations against his resort, which hosted the Miss Universe pageant last month. Trump spokesman Ed Russo was quoted by the Miami Herald on Thursday as saying that the lawsuit was being dropped in favor of negotiations with the city of Doral. 'In good faith, we have decided to voluntarily withdraw our lawsuit against the city, and we look forward to productive discourse regarding this matter,' Russo said. Records show that since August, the city's code-compliance department has issued more than 100 violations to Trump's resort, Trump National Doral. Most violations are for the resort's lawn maintenance crews making 'unreasonably loud noise.' Trump has withdrawn a lawsuit he just filed against city officials in Doral over noise-ordinance violations against his resort. He is seen with Miss Universe 2015 Paulina Vega at the resort last month . In the lawsuit filed Feb. 12, Trump said the ordinance 'is vague and ambiguous in its definition of prohibited activity, and provides the city's Code Enforcement Department with unfettered discretion for determining whether a violation exists.' Trump rejects the noise-violation accusations against his resort. 'This is the finest resort in the world and you have to cut the grass,' Trump said. 'Why is it that we have brand new equipment and get fined, when the people who had the property before me didn't get any citations?' he said. 'Maybe it's because I have money.' Pageant: Donald is seen with the Miss Universe 2015 contestants in this January 9, 2015 file photo . Trump's lawyers say each violation carries a $1,500 fine and he's already spent $50,000 in legal fees to fight the citations. They say since buying the property out of bankruptcy in 2012, Trump has pushed the city to amend the noise ordinance . Trump's lawyers say each violation carries a $1,500 fine and he's already spent $50,000 in legal fees to fight the citations. They say since buying the property out of bankruptcy in 2012, Trump has pushed the city to amend the noise ordinance. The resort recently hosted the Miss Universe pageant. Trump says he's not sure whether the dispute will interfere with the recently announced plan to award him a key to Doral. 'If it does, this is much more important,' he said. 'They may be giving me the key to the city, but I have not been treated right.' Donald Trump, no stranger to noisy publicity, is complaining again about the roar of jets in a $100 million lawsuit over air traffic he says is purposely being directed to fly over his ritzy Palm Beach club. Trump filed the suit against Palm Beach County last month, claiming his history of conflict with Palm Beach International Airport has led officials to spitefully redirect air traffic over his historic Mar-a-Lago estate in south Florida. 'I am saving one of the great houses of this country and one of its greatest landmarks,' he said in an interview, 'and it's being badly damaged by the airplanes.' Rather than fanning air traffic in multiple directions, Trump says the county's airports director -- who has been named in prior litigation filed by the real estate mogul -- has successfully pressured the Federal Aviation Administration to have controllers direct almost all flights due east, directly above Mar-a-Lago, the lawsuit claims. It calls the actions 'deliberate and malicious.' Noise, vibrations and emissions from the planes are causing cracks and other damage to porous stone construction, antique Spanish tiles, roofing, floors and columns, not to mention disrupting 'the once serene and tranquil ambience,' the lawsuit says.","Donald Trump has withdrawn a lawsuit he just filed against city officials in a Miami suburb over noise-ordinance violations against his resort .

"A damning official report claims dishonesty within the U.S. military is so endemic that everyone assumes they are being lied to at all times. The shock report calls on officials to 'urgently confront the corrupting influence of dishonesty' within the army, warning officers have become 'ethically numb'. The situation has become so bad, the executive summary concludes it has 'allowed leaders to espouse lofty professional values while slogging through the mire of dishonesty and deceit'.

Report authors Leonard Wong and Stephen J. Gerras say it is often justified one of three ways: 'mission accomplishment', 'supporting the troops' or that the task or reporting requirement is unreasonable or 'dumb'. They go onto note lying and 'adjusting the truth' is so common, military personnel who order a report do not trust its content. The report authors, who interviewed staff at all levels in the army in order to compile the 53-page document, state: 'It appears that a peculiar situation where those requesting the information, and those supplying it know that the information is questionable.'

According to CNN, Hagel wrote: 'The vast majority of our senior leaders are men and women who have earned the special trust and confidence afforded them by the American people.

"When you're small in stature, life can sometimes go over your head. This was certainly the case for Pedro the Shetland pony, who at just 43in was unable to see over his stable door. But luckily for him, a group of local schoolchildren came to the rescue – by designing a special equine periscope. Scroll down for video . Pedro the Shetland pony uses his 'Pedroscope' designed by schoolchildren to see over his stable gate . The cardboard contraption – nicknamed the Pedroscope – is fixed to the 60in gate and uses carefully placed mirrors to give 14-year-old Pedro a view of his yard. It was built by printing firm Print & Cut, which heard about the idea through a volunteer. Pint-sized Pedro was kindly given a home at Ebony Horse Club, in Brixton, London, last year as his height makes him perfect for small or disabled children to pet. Builders estimated it would cost thousands of pounds for a bespoke, miniature pad for Pedro - money the struggling charity do not have. So instead local school children thought up a special cardboard periscope dubbed the 'Pedroscope' he can peek through – and enjoy watching his trotting stable-mates. 'The Pedroscope' helps pint-sized Pedro see the outside world as he too small for his current stable door . Petite Pedro (pictured) is just 43in tall and is unable to see over his stable door properly . Letty Porter from the charity, which gives disadvantaged children the chance to engage with horses, said: 'We'd love to buy him a new miniature stable with a lower door. But this is a fun interim solution.' Yesterday a delighted Pedro used his 'Pedroscope' to view his friends and staff are now geeing themselves for the mammoth task of fundraising to build him a more size-appropriate home. Funding manager Ms Porter said: 'Pedro spends lots of his time out in the paddock playing, so he has a wonderful life. 'But we'd love to buy him a new miniature stable with a lower door so he can look out and see what's going on when relaxing in his stable. 'While we raise the funds, we thought we'd ask local schoolchildren to make it their project to invent a fun interim solution. Local schoolchildren thought the idea up - Pedro can now enjoy watching his stable-mates trot in the yard . 'We were blown away by their ideas. Little did we know one conversation with a volunteer would lead to a company agreeing to build a full-size working 'Pedroscope'. We're so thankful to them.' Other ideas the children came up with included 'suspend him from a giant helium balloon', 'build a set of steps for his stable', 'cut a spy hatch into his door', and 'build him a very high straw bed.' Helper Grace Mpungi, 11, said: 'Pedro is so cute and our other horses love him. I'd never seen a horse in real life 'til I came to Ebony, never mind one as small as Pedro.' Schoolboy Cameron Chapman, 15, who coined the name 'Pedroscope' added: 'We've been looking it up online and reckon it's the world's first pony periscope!' Pedro eagerly attempts to get his bowl of feed being offered to him over his stable door by a helpful assistant . Ebony Horse Club worker Tanya White, 25, said: 'For kids who have never seen a horse, they can be scary at first so Pedro's perfect for gaining their confidence. 'Last week he visited a school we work with where a number of students are wheelchair users. They loved him as he was so good with them. 'The children come to us through referrals from schools, police and social workers. Horse-riding gives them both an outlet and a direction in life.' Alternative ideas thought up by schoolchildren  included 'suspend him from a giant helium balloon', 'build a set of steps for his stable', 'cut a spy hatch into his door', and 'build him a very high straw bed' Riding instructor Sorrel Docherty, 24, said: 'The children have been really imaginative in coming up with ideas for Pedro's problem. 'I love the 'Pedroscope' and Pedro's just getting the hang of it. But really he would love a mini stable of his own.' Martina Burrell, 37, mother of one of Pedro's young autistic carers Shay, said: 'I've grown up round Brixton and I can't believe we've got this community riding centre right on our doorstep. 'It's changed my son's life. He was recently diagnosed with Autism, never did any sport and finds it hard to make friends at school. 'But here, he's like a different child. I'm so grateful to Ebony.'

"Domenico Rancadore, leaving court today, has been ordered to return to Italy after losing his battle against extradition . A Sicilian Mafia boss caught in London's suburbia after two decades on the run has been ordered to return to Italy after losing his battle against extradition. Domenico Rancadore, also known as The Professor in mafia circles, fled to Britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in Italy for his role as a 'man of honour', taking bribes from builders in Palermo. But after spending 20 years holed up in Uxbridge, west London, the 65-year-old has been told he must return to his native country to serve a seven-year sentence for association with the organised crime syndicate. It comes after protracted extradition proceedings which saw a judge reverse his initial decision over concerns that Italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition. Rancadore had spent a year and a half fighting extradition before Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle told the pensioner he had to leave the country. He has seven days within which to lodge an appeal against the decision, after which he will be removed from the country within 10 days, an official at Wesminster Magistrates' Court said. The mobster, who has been released on conditional bail, was first arrested on a European Arrest Warrant at his semi-detached home in August 2013. Although never convicted of murder, the Italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country, after he fled in 1995. He was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his 'Mafia association'. The ruling came after protracted extradition proceedings which saw Judge Riddle reverse his initial decision over concerns that Italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition. But Rancadore was rearrested a month later and his wife Anne Skinner, known to the court as Mrs Rancadore, told the court of his deteriorating health and how he suffered from claustrophobia. Domenico Rancadore, (right and left outside court today with wife Anne Skinner), fled to Britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in Italy for his role as a 'man of honour' The mafia boss lived a double life in Uxbridge under the name Marc Skinner after arriving in Britain in the 1990s . Before his arrest in 2013, the Mafia don spent two decades living under the name of Marc Skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge, obscured from view. He claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father, Giuseppe. Rancadore's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 Mafiosi indicted. In April Alun Jones QC, defending, made an abuse of process application, arguing that a case could not be brought against a defendant more than once. But a new arrest had been issued, with the Italian authorities admitting the CPS had made a 'comical series of blunders' in relation to Rancadore's extradition. Rancadore has seven days within which to lodge an appeal against the decision, after which he will be removed from the country within 10 days, an official at Wesminster Magistrates' Court said . The issues related to the late service of papers and the failure to inform Rancadore's counsel that assurances had been given by the Italian authorities regarding the prison he would be sent to. In his judgment Judge Riddle said: 'It is sometimes said that extradition proceedings are criminal proceedings. In some ways they are, but in other ways they are not. An extradition court is not concerned with determining innocence or guilt.' He concluded: 'I am satisfied that, even without the assurance, there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to Italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment. 'Whether the assurance of 14th March is in his interests, and whether he wishes to take advantage of it, are not matters for this court to consider.' 'I must order the extradition of Domenico Rancadore to Italy. He has seven days to appeal this decision.' Also known as Cosa Nostra, which translates as 'Our Thing', the Mafia emerged in Sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct. Groups, often known as families or clans, will claim leadership of an area, usually a town or village, and operate rackets within it, using violence to punish those causing problems to their 'clients' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection. Most of the clans are led by a 'boss' (capofamiglia or rappresentante), who is aided by an underboss (capo bastone or sotto capo) and supervised by one or more advisers (consigliere). Only men are allowed to join the clans, and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges. It has been estimated that the Sicilian Mafia costs the region's economy more than €10 billion a year, and that roughly 70 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money. Politicians have also been accused of using the Mafia to buy votes during elections. The American Mafia arose from offshoots of the Cosa Nostra that emerged in the United States during the late nineteenth century, following waves of emigration from Italy.","Domenico Rancadore has been holed up in Uxbridge, London for 20 years .

"A German historical society is set to publish an annotated edition of Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf after its copyright runs out later this year. The Munich Institute for Contemporary History (IfZ) will publish a two-volume edition of the book in which the Nazi leader outlines his anti-Semitic beliefs and plans for world domination. The new  volume will consist of 2,000 pages however just 780 of these will contain Hitler's original text while the rest will be filled by comments from researchers as well as an introduction and index. A German historical society is to publish an annotated edition of Hitler's autobiography Mien Kampf after the copyright runs out later this year .

Under German law copyright expires 70 years after the author's death. Bavarian authorities have previously insisted that it would be illegal for anyone to publish the book under German law banning the spreading of Nazi ideology. Dieter Graumann, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said last year that he was strongly opposed to the book going on sale. Bavarian authorities have previously insisted that it would be illegal for anyone to publish the book under German law banning the spreading of Nazi ideology . He told a news website: 'The very thought of a new publication of Hitler’s ‘Mein Kampf’ is more than disgusting and goes against all my beliefs to fight neo-fascism and right-wing extremism. 'This book was and will remain a pure anti-Semitic work of irrational hatred that should be forbidden for evermore. 'It is an abhorrent pamphlet full of incitement of the Jewish people and it brutally hurts the feelings of the Shoa-survivors.' Justice ministers representing all  German states have previously ruled that anyone publishing non-annotated copies of Mien Kampf would face a prosecution for incitement to hatred, they said. Although no statement was given on legality of annotated copies a spokeswoman for the Bavarian justice ministry said such a work should be legal under certain conditions.

Footage shows Brady Becker, 17, being punched repeatedly in the face by plain clothed detective Nicholas Breaux in the incident which occurred on Friday night at Lakeside Shopping Center in Metairie.

Brady Becker, 17, was left badly beaten after an altercation with plain clothed Louisiana detective Nicholas Breaux at a Mardi Gras parade in Metairie on Friday . According to the  arrest report Becker is alleged to have shouted 'f*** the cops' multiple times at the detectives, but friends of the boy who were present deny that and say the attack was unprovoked. Becker's friend, Jacob Jenson, 16, said the incident started when one of the detectives walked up and told him, 'If I punch you in your face, would I still be a f****** cop?' Jensen said neither he nor anyone else in his group had yelled at the men, who they were aware were police, reports NOLA.com. He said he told the detective he wanted no trouble, but then the man asked him again in an even more aggressive fashion. At this point Becker decided to defend his friend. 'I said, 'What the F is going on,' trying to find out why he's getting in his face. That's when he starts beating me up,' Becker said. Becker suffered a cut to his left eyebrow, a fractured right cheek and jaw and black eyes. He was detained overnight and his vision still remains blurry . The detective then tackled Becker to the ground and beat him quite severely. Becker suffered a cut to his left eyebrow, a fractured right cheek and jaw and black eyes.

"You're listening to a playlist on 'shuffle' when you notice three Katy Perry songs have played back to back - what are the chances? While some dismiss this as a coincidence, others claim that so-called 'random' playlists aren't random at all. Instead, they say, music services are conspiring against listeners to promote tracks. It's a criticism that Spotify has faced, and as a result the music service has had to change its algorithms to fit the human brain's warped idea of 'random'. New York-based Spotify admits it had to change its playlist algorithm to be less random in order to trick its users into hearing what the believed to be random songs. The graphic shows different genre songs (labelled in various colours) spread out evenly to fit the human expectation for 'random' in Spotify's new algorithm . 'On my 442 song playlist, the same 30 or 35 tracks play over and over again and the other 400 songs I have barely heard once,' one user wrote on a Spotify forum. 'It's almost unbelievable to me that such a simple process is broken,' another user wrote. 'The only remaining explanation I can give is that Spotify deliberately chooses the songs that are cheaper for Spotify to pay royalties.' But Spotify has denied these allegations. Instead, it says, it's all in our heads. 'Our brain is an excellent pattern-matching device,' said Babar Zafar, a lead developer at Spotify, in an interview for Tech Tent on the BBC World Service. 'It will find patterns where there aren't any.' Spotify realised that our brains actually want to see what we consider 'random' – or different genres of music spread evenly over a playlist. Spotify's algorithm – which is anything but random – uses the length of a playlist and records how many of each type of song it contains . The human brain is designed to notice coincidences. It is also programmed to expect something to happen if it hasn't occurred in a while. For instance, people often think that if they haven't won anything in a scratch card lottery a couple of times in a row, they should have bigger chance of winning the next time. This phenomenon is called Gambler's fallacy and it's the same fallacy that lead to the mistake about playlists not being random. 'If you just heard a song from a particular artist, that doesn't mean that the next song will be more likely from a different artist in a perfectly random order,' says Spotify on its blog. 'The problem is that, to humans, truly random does not feel random,' said Mattias Johansson, a Spotify software engineer, in a response on the question-and-answer site Quora. Get two friends. Ask one to flip a coin 30 times and write down the sequence of heads and tails. The other will imagine flipping a coin 30 times and also write the sequence of results. They do this in secret, so you don't know who has flipped the real coin and who has flipped the imaginary one. The 'wow' moment comes when you're presented with the two lists of heads and tails and it's usually instantly obvious which is which. The first list is properly random. The second is a human attempting to be random. You can tell the difference because humans are very, very bad at faking randomness. We just can't do it. There are different ways to tell the fake and real randomness apart, but the most obvious is to look for runs of straight heads, or straight tails. If one of the lists has a run of five heads or tails in a row, you can be pretty sure that's the real coin. In a list of 30 coin flips you're reasonably likely to get a run of five. When someone is imagining coin flips, however, they almost never imagine a run of five straight heads or tails. This is because after two or three heads our brains tend to think, 'OK, time for a tails now.' Our brains are implementing an order, a 'coin memory', whereas in fact true randomness has no memory of what came before. Randomness creates counter-intuitively large clusters, such as a run of five heads in 30 flips of a coin, which leads to unexpected results. 'So we got tons of complaints from users about it not being random. 'Last year, we updated it with a new algorithm that is intended to feel more random to a human.' Spotify realised that our brains actually want to see what we consider 'random' – or different genres of music spread evenly over a playlist. Spotify's algorithm – which is anything but random – uses the length of a playlist and records how many of each type of song it contains. If there are five Pulp songs in the playlist, they will appear at 20 per cent intervals. Perfectly random means that the following two orders are equally likely to occur (different colours represent different artists). However, to the human brain the bottom row does not appear random . For artist's that only have one song in the playlist, the algorithm makes sure they appear at random intervals, rather than all at the start. The algorithm also shuffles songs by the same artist among each other to prevent songs from the same album playing too close together. Spotify isn't the only one who has had to make its playlists less random in order to appear more random. In response to complaints from users, Apple chief executive Steve Jobs changed the programming behind its 'shuffle' feature to make sure each song was significantly different from the last. But despite this, some people still see patterns in their playlists. 'Working at Spotify has taught me a few things, one of them being is that it's really, really, really hard to build something that a human will genuinely feel is shuffled.' Said Mr Johansson. 'People still constantly come up to me at parties and tell me that the shuffle functionality is not random.'","Spotify was accused of making deal with labels to promote songs .

"It might not sound like the best way to digest your food, but this is the restaurant to visit if you want your food delivered by rollercoaster. Diners tucking into dinner at Rogo's in Yas Island, Abu Dhabi, will have their orders served not by waiters, but via 30 tracks running throughout its dining room, with a 12-metre, tornado-shaped gigantic spiral that gets narrower from top to bottom. Each table in the restaurant has its own individually designed rollercoaster track and a unique silent delivery system that sees food make a gravity-defying 360-degree journey to tables. Dining with a twist: Diners wait for their meal which will race down on of the 30 tracks . Customers are shown to their table before they order their meal on a tablet. The order then slides to the kitchen via a mini transport conveyor before arriving at a bank of chefs. Food is then cooked before being placed in a pod – which is where the fun starts. An elevator carefully lifts the food pod to the start of the track before the gently releasing it on to a coaster track. The coasters have several loops, some which run parallel and other which run in opposite directions. Each place setting is outfitted with a tablet which customers can use to order their meal .

"A Scottish castle, said to be haunted by the ghost of a murdered cardinal, is now on the market - for a cool £1.65million. The stunning Ethie Castle, near Arbroath, Angus, was once home to Cardinal David Beaton. Beaton had a reputation for savage persecution of Protestants in the 16th Century and got his comeuppance when he was killed by Protestant nobles, who hung his body out of a window. Ethie Castle, in Scotland, is said to be haunted by the ghost of murdered Cardinal David Beaton . According to legend, the ghost of the cardinal can still be heard at night as he parades around Ethie, hindered by his gouty leg, which makes a thumping sound as he drags it behind him. There are other spooky elements to the majestic castle, including a secret staircase to the chapel, ornate public rooms, and a walled garden. Other amenities include tennis courts and an outdoor swimming pool. The expansive property, near Arbroath, Angus, is now on the market for a cool £1.65 million . Beaton, who had a reputation for poor treatment of Protestants, was brutally murdered in 1546 . Ethie was built in the 14th Century by the Abbot and monks of Arbroath Abbey. The small chapel, as well as the Cardinal's Sitting Room, complete with a secret staircase to the Great Hall above, still remains. Beaton, who became the cardinal and Chancellor of Scotland, was a powerful figure in the Catholic Church. In 1545, he arranged for the arrest, trial and execution by burning of Protestant preacher George Wishart. This cruel act ultimately was what lead to Beaton's demise, and just one year later Protestant nobles sought revenge. According to legend, the ghost of the cardinal can still be heard at night as he walks around Ethie . Due to a gouty leg, the cardinal used to make a great deal of noise while walking, which guests claim to hear . Sightings of the cardinal have primary occurred on the narrow staircase near his old bedroom . In 1546, a group, which included Fife laird John Leslie of Parkhill, managed to get to Beaton after killing his porter. The cardinal was murdered by the angry men and his corpse mutilated and hung out of a window for all to see. Shortly thereafter, Beaton's ghost was rumoured to be seen wandering around Ethie, complete with the dragging noise. Sightings have primarily occurred on the narrow staircase that leads to a secret doorway in his old bedroom. But the cardinal is not the only ghost believed to haunt the castle. Guests at Ethie have also reported hearing cries of a child at night, followed by the sound of a wheeled toy being pulled across the floor. Following his death, the cardinal's mutilated corpse was said to be hung out of a window for all to see . Guests at Ethie also report hearing the cries of another ghost - a small child - and the sound of a wheeled toy . Legend has it that a secret room was discovered by a new governess of the castle after being kept awake by the sounds of a boy crying. After breaking into the walled room, the governess discovered a skeleton of a child lying on the floor next to the remains of a wooden cart. Though known primarily for its supernatural activity, Ethie has also played host to many notable people over the years. In 1665, it was bought by the Earls of Northesk and is said to be the inspiration behind the fictional Castle of Knockwhinnock in Sir Walter Scott's novel, The Antiquary. It was later restored by Alistair Forsyth. Currently, the property is being advertised for purchase with no mention of its ghostly happenings . The house is described as a 'residence of great character' complete with 'many fine features' Currently, Ethie Castle is being advertised by a Savills estate agent, who describes it as a 'most imposing and historic castle,' though makes no mention of the ghostly goings on. As the brochure outlines: 'In recent years, the castle has been carefully restored. It has evolved over the centuries from its ancient beginnings and, with its wings and towers, forms a magnificent residence of great character. 'Architecturally, the castle contains many fine features including four turnpike staircases, a balustraded tower, turrets and crow stepped gables. 'The barrel vaulted rooms, together with panelled rooms, decorative plaster work, fireplaces and window shutters all provide an insight into the history associated with the castle.'","Ethie Castle, near Arbroath, Angus, was home to Cardinal David Beaton .

"Chocolate has traditionally been a bit naughty... but nice. Now, however, it could have another benefit after scientists claim to have created the first ‘beauty chocolate’. The sweet treat will apparently smooth wrinkles, increase blood flow and help skin look radiant. New product: Its creators claim eating one 7.5g bar a day will have visible effects within just three weeks . Its creators claim eating one 7.5g bar a day of Esthechoc will have visible effects within just three weeks. The beauty claims come from its high levels of two antioxidants. Esthechoc is also only 38 calories per bar with a cocoa content of 72 per cent. However, it may fail to satisfy chocoholics as a bar is equivalent to just one square from a 45g bar of Cadbury’s Dairy Milk, which weighs in at 240 calories. Esthechoc was developed from research originating at Cambridge University and will be unveiled at next month’s Global Food Innovation Summit in London. 'Esthechoc': The sweet treat will apparently smooth wrinkles, increase blood flow and help skin look radiant . The makers, Cambridge-based Lycotec, claim one 7.5g bar contains as much anti-inflammatory astaxanthin as a 300g serving of salmon. It also has as much flavanol, an antioxidant linked to cutting bad cholesterol, as 100g of dark chocolate. A 7.5g chunk of dark chocolate would have only a 13th of Esthechoc’s volume of flavonoids. Cambridge Chocolate Technologies, a spin-off firm which will market the chocolate, claims that volunteers in their 50s and 60s showed signs of health improvement in clinical trials. After three weeks, they had improved blood supply to the skin and subcutaneous fat. This boosted oxygen to the skin and improved respiration. Not quite the same: Esthechoc may fail to satisfy chocoholics as a bar is equivalent to just one square from a 45g bar of Cadbury’s Dairy Milk (above), which weighs in at 240 calories . The chocolate is due to be stocked in Britain by a ‘prestigious’ but unnamed retailer, the firm said. The price has yet to be revealed. A spokesman said it was the outcome of a decade of research and trials involving more than 3,000 volunteers. He described it as an ‘exquisite functional dark chocolate enriched with powerful plant extracts’. But Professor Naveed Sattar, of Glasgow University, said more robust trials were needed to validate the ‘ridiculously strong’ claims. He added: ‘Eating too much chocolate means more calories, which means obesity.’ Esthechoc will be sold in boxes of 21 bars to be eaten as a daily ‘dose’ for three weeks.","'Visible effects in three weeks' from eating one bar a day of Esthechoc .

"It doesn't come grander or more romantic than sleeping in a centuries-old castle. And as anticipation for a live remake of Walt Disney's Cinderella hots up, you'd be forgiven for dreaming of romantic medieval haunts, four-poster beds and huge log fires. One place where those dreams can come true is Bovey Castle, in Dartmoor National Park, which was built in 1906 for Viscount Hambledon, son of the business tycoon WH Smith.

"A jealous husband who tried to strangle his nurse wife to death in front of patients in the intensive care unit where she worked has been jailed for 15 years. Royston Jones, 39, attempted to murder Claire Jones at Nevill Hall hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales, after becoming convinced she was having an affair. Her colleagues bravely managed to stop the attack by pulling bare-chested Jones off his victim, ignoring his untrue claim that he was armed with a hand grenade. Caught on camera: This was the moment bare-chested Royston Jones walked through Nevill Hall hospital in Abergavenny before attempting to strangle his wife to death . Royston Jones, right on the day of the attack, tried to murder Claire Jones, left,  after becoming convinced she was having an affair . Father-of-three Jones, of  Blaenau Gwent, left Mrs Jones, 35, his wife of 14 years, unconscious after the attack on September 5 last year. She was taken to the A&E unit at the hospital, where she was treated for a swollen neck and throat, elbow and back injuries. Jones, who threatened to kill his wife after she moved out of the marital home in early 2014, was convicted of attempted murder by a jury at Newport Crown Court. Sentencing Jones at Cardiff Crown Court, Judge Eleri Rees, the Recorder of Cardiff, said Jones drove to the hospital after taking mephedrone. 'You headed straight for her, saying ""you have done it now"",' the judge said. 'Consultant Edward Curtis saw you outside the locked door of the unit. 'You barged your way through the doors after a nurse who had just entered. Dr Curtis instructed staff to call police and followed you. 'He saw you on top of Claire strangling her. Her face was changing colour and you were saying the words ""kill"" or ""die"". Jones (picturerd) was convicted of attempted murder by a jury at Newport Crown Court . 'Dr Curtis bravely engaged in a monumental struggle with you. You kneed Dr Curtis with considerable force.' Nurses were able to drag Mrs Jones away to a side room as 15 stone Jones grappled with Dr Curtis on the floor, the judge said. But Jones leapt to his feet, forced his way into the room and renewed his attack. Dr Curtis managed to loosen one of Jones' arms so his victim could slip to the floor, where she was dragged away again by colleagues. They took her to a side room and barricaded themselves in as Dr Curtis continued to restrain Jones, assisted by hospital porters. 'It took five men to control your movements,' the judge said. 'You threatened to bite them saying you had hepatitis and said you had a hand grenade. 'This was a high dependency unit with six very ill patients being cared for. They were exposed to the most frightening and shocking scene.' Jones was 'jealous, possessive and aggressive' and convinced his estranged wife was in another relationship, Michael Jones, prosecuting, previously said. 'He had his hands around her throat and there's no doubt he was trying to kill her by strangling her,' the prosecutor said. 'Other members of staff tried to pull him away. He was too strong, however, and continued to try to kill her.' Representing Jones, Hilary Roberts said the attack was due to his client's use of mephedrone and said he had no memory of the attack. 'He behaved under the influence of drugs,' Mr Roberts said. 'He is as horrified as everybody else at the story that unfolded through the trial and was graphically told by witnesses. 'The defendant fully and truly apologises for everybody for his behaviour. He is mortified at what he has done. 'He has no memory of these events and he cannot conceive himself forming an intention to harm her, let alone to kill her.' Father-of-three Jones, pictured on the day of the attack, left Mrs Jones, 35, his wife of 14 years, unconscious after the attack on September 5 last year . Mrs was taken to the A&E unit at the hospital, pictured, where she was treated for a swollen neck and throat, elbow and back injuries . The court heard Jones appeared before magistrates in August last year and was sentenced to a community order and supervision for battery on Mrs Jones. After being arrested for attempting to murder his wife, Jones told officers 'when I get out I will finish it properly'. The judge imposed a restraining order banning Jones from contacting his wife, including electronically. Speaking after Jones' conviction, Detective Inspector Leigh Mears, of Gwent Police, said: 'This was both a very frightening and disturbing incident in a place that is supposed to be a place of safety - a hospital. 'We must acknowledge the bravery of staff at Nevill Hall hospital - colleagues of the victim - for stepping in as they did, which undoubtedly prevented further serious harm to the victim. 'We would like to reassure anyone who is experiencing any form of domestic abuse that they are not on their own and there is help and support there for you. There is no justifiable excuse for committing domestic abuse.'","Royston Jones was convinced that wife Claire Jones was having an affair .

"A Melbourne ice dealer tortured then suffocated another drug user because he thought he had dobbed him in to police, a Melbourne court has heard. Prosecutor Mark Rochford says Harvey Spence, 30, told a friend he was involved in a disappearance, that he dismembered and burnt the body, and would never get over the smell. The crown alleges he told a friend: 'Did I torture him? Yes I did. Did he cop it bad? Yes he did. Did I really want to do it? No. Did I get off on it? Yes.' A Melbourne ice dealer tortured then suffocated another drug user because he thought he had dobbed him in to police, a Melbourne court has heard.

Harvey Spence, 30, has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Nhan Ngoc Doan, also known as Kevin Doan, who has not been seen since January 6, 2013 . Spence, of Footscray, has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Nhan Ngoc Doan, also known as Kevin Doan, who has not been seen since January 6, 2013. Mr Rochford told the Victorian Supreme Court on Friday that Spence had become paranoid after being arrested for drug possession and blamed two people for tipping off police. Mr Rochford said Spence and two associates drove Mr Doan to a property in East Gippsland where he was killed. The crown says Spence dragged Mr Doan to a shed, put an elbow on his head and said: 'Why haven't you been to jail? All your friends are in jail. You've given them up', before forcing an associate to suffocate him at gunpoint. Mr Rochford said one of the other men said: 'What if it was the other one man? You can't f****** do that to him.' Spence allegedly replied, 'No f*** the dog. He goes.' Defence barrister John Desmond told the jury the crown case relied on the evidence of two people who were inherently unreliable. 'These two men are both liars and cheats,' Mr Desmond said. One of them lied for six hours of his interview with police, the other tried to cut a deal, saying, 'I've got my a*** in the sling here.' 'You wouldn't hang a dog on what either or both of these men have to say,' Mr Desmond said. The trial continues before Justice Michael Croucher.","A Melbourne ice dealer allegedly killed another drug user as he thought he had dobbed him into police .

"Nathan Heath, 20, was caught shortly after burgling a house when his victim followed footprints he left in the snow . A serial burglar was caught after posting pictures of his haul on Facebook and by leaving a trail of footprints in snow - leading to where he was hiding. Nathan Heath, 20, broke into a house in Hull, West Yorkshire, as the homeowner slept before fleeing with the stolen items to a friends house almost a mile away. When the victim woke up and found his front door ajar he followed the footprints all the way to the house and called police - who found Heath and the stolen goods inside. A manhunt was launched after Heath failed to appear at Hull Magistrates' Court on January 2, but rather than answer the charges that day, he was instead burgling another house. He took a Ford Fiesta, two laptops, a television, a games console, a wallet, a purse, jewellery, fishing equipment, a quad bike and cash from the house. While on the run, he used his social media accounts to boast about his crimes and claimed he would never be caught. One account in the name of Nathan Heath Ov NHE (North Hull Estate - a gang) shows him posing with fanned out bank notes and the caption: 'I ripped him off'. Heath was jailed for three years at Hull Crown Court yesterday, where he admitted to 50 previously unsolved crimes, and stole items worth more than £26,000. PC Andy White from Humberside Police, said: 'Nathan Heath is a one-man crime wave. We believe he has been prolific for a very long time. 'Not only was he committing crimes, mainly burglaries, in Hull, but in parts of the East Riding, too.' Sergeant Richard West, of the Northern neighbourhood policing team at Humberside Police, said: 'Nathan Heath was prolific in committing crimes across the city. This map shows the route Nathan Heath walked in the snow, leaving his footprints behind for the victim to follow from his house on Golf Links Road all the way to his friend's house on 32nd Avenue in Hull . Heath was followed to his friends house by his victim, who called police and found him inside with the stolen goods. He used social media to boast about his crimes, including pictures of himself with cash (right) The serial burglar admitted to police that he committed 35 separate burglaries in four months, totalling more than £26,000 worth of goods . 'He was on the run for a month but we knew we would get him and bring him to justice. 'He has been removed from the streets and we hope this makes the city a safer place for residents.' Hull Crown Court heard how Heath had told officers he committed 35 separate burglaries between September 1, last year, and January 26, this year. Many of them were committed while homeowners slept in their beds and none of which have been recovered. One incident during the early hours of November 17 saw Heath target a family home after an argument the previous day. A man told Heath to stop urinating against a public wall. The following night, on the same day he was due in court, he snatched house keys through a cat flap, and stole items worth £21,000 - including a Vauxhall Astra, a Volkswagen work van, a mobile phone, a laptop, power tools, a wallet, a purse and cash. On leaving the property, Heath painted an offensive word across the home's windows. After the burglary on January 2, the victim took to Facebook to appeal for information about his stolen Ford Fiesta. Heath used his Facebook page to 'boast' about the items he stole, including dozens of bikes (pictured) He also posted pictures showing wads of cash (above) on Facebook, writing: 'Pleny more were this came from [sic]' In doing so, he came across the Facebook page Nathan Heath ov NHE. The cover photograph had been changed to a picture of Heath posing in the victim's stolen car. Heath's final burglary happened on Tuesday, February 3. Detective Constable Lee Sims, of the priority crime team in Hull, said: 'Nathan Heath has admitted being responsible for 56 offences. They were taken into account as part of his sentencing. 'By admitting all these offences and the harm he has caused, it is hoped Heath will break his cycle of offending when he leaves prison. 'At the same time, his many victims know he has been brought to justice. With Heath, we used Operation Cleanslate. 'This gives offenders an opportunity to admit offences, many of which the police may be unaware of their involvement in.'","Nathan Heath, 20, broke into house as homeowner slept and fled with items .

"Parents are outraged that a registered sex offender was allowed to play at a school concert. Melissa Salsbury, who also models as Mia Rose, performed during assembly at Kiona-Benton City High School in Benton City, Washington on Tuesday. She was part of group, A.N.E./Money over Misery, which aims to share positive messages about bullying, peer pressure and self-worth. Salsbury, however, was convicted in 2011 and imprisoned for almost a year for forcing underage girls into prostitution. She was placed on the sex offenders' register. Scroll down for video . Melissa Salsbury, who also goes by the modelling name Mia Rose, turned herself into police after performing at a high school with her band despite being on the sex offenders' registry . Police heard on Tuesday that Salsbury had been at the school. Benton County Sheriff’s Detective Mike Wilson told Tri-City Herald that Salsbury turned herself into police on Wednesday. The school district apologized to angry parents and students for the situation, adding that Salsbury had not been cleared to perform there. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment on Friday from A.N.E., but it appeared that her fellow band members were unaware Salsbury was a convicted sex offender. In a YouTube message on Thursday, the group said: 'Yes it was a negative incident that took place a couple of years ago and that is still held over that individual's head but we are here to spread a positive message. We are here to spread positive hip-hop.' They added: 'We don't condone the incidents that took place a few years ago and we want everyone to know we didn't have any knowledge of that.' In 2011, Salsbury was jailed for 300 days for forcing underage girls to have sex with men, the Tri-City Herald reported. Model Mia Rose (left and right) spent almost a year in prison in 2011 after she forced girls who thought they were going to do exotic dancing into having sex with men who answered personal ads . A registered sex offender was among the performers at a motivational assembly Tuesday at Kiona-Benton City High School in Washington. The school district apologized to outraged parents for not completing a background check . Salsbury, then 20 and having just given birth to her son, pleaded guilty to a felony of promoting commercial sexual abuse of a minor. She was given a reduced sentence due to her full cooperation with police which led to the convictions of five others, including her husband. It was also noted that Salsbury had been forced into stripping and prostitution when she was a minor and was reportedly told she would be traded into the sex slave industry if she didn't cooperate. According to the local news outlet, Salsbury recruited 17 and 18-year-old high school girls in 2010 telling them they would be paid to dance. Salsbury put ads on a classifieds website and then when contacted by johns would rent rooms at a Kennewick hotel and force girls into sex with the men. She threatened the girls by telling them she would tell their parents or boyfriends, and that they would be traded into sex slavery. She kept profits from the prostitution, according to reports from the time. She was caught and the prostitution ring discovered when one emotionally distressed girl broke down to a school teacher.","Melissa Salsbury, who also goes by Mia Rose, performed during assembly at Kiona-Benton City High School in Washington on Tuesday .

"Aileen Robertson, pictured with now seven-month-old Isaac, who claims she was told breastfeeding was not a reason for her to avoid jury duty . A mother who asked to be excused from jury duty because she is breastfeeding claims she has had her application declined because she can still 'use a bottle'. The comment, said to have been made by an official at Dunfermline Sheriff Court, Fife, has been condemned by breastfeeding campaigners as 'appalling'. Aileen Robertson, 39, was cited for jury service when her first-born, Isaac, was only a few weeks old. She claims she filled in a form asking for an exemption, but received a letter to say she was still to attend court on March 16. The Fife resident then rang to explain that she was still breastfeeding her seven-month-old, but was told that was not a reason to miss jury duty because she could 'use a bottle'. That would mean leaving Isaac, her first child, at home and either feeding him with enough expressed milk to last at least a week or switching to formula. However, a Scottish Court Service spokesperson claimed no formal application had been received, and to state it was denied on the grounds of breastfeeding was 'incorrect'. The situation leaves Mrs Robertson in limbo after she claims court staff on the phone told her to send away a medical certificate by her doctor. Despite doing this, she said she has yet to receive a response and  is expected to attend the court hearing. She said: 'I was surprised when they told me that I had to provide a doctor's note. 'Breastfeeding is not an illness or a medical condition, so why use up precious surgery time getting GPs to write up notes in such circumstances? 'Health services are doing everything they can to promote breastfeeding, so it does not make sense for the court service to make things more difficult. 'There doesn't seem to be any consistency. I have friends who have called up to say they were breastfeeding and were excused, whereas others have had the same issues as me.' She added: 'In my case, I do not have the option of expressing and giving him milk in a bottle because he simply won't take it. I don't even have a breast pump. 'There would be the issue of childcare as well. I'm currently on maternity leave so somebody would have to look after him. He is fed about five times a day so even if he took milk from a bottle it would be almost impossible for me to express that amount if I was on jury duty.' She said there needed to be 'clearer guidelines' set in place to prevent this from reoccurring. She said: 'I understand there is a need to encourage citizens to help the legal process but this should not be at the expense of what is an important public health issue.

Surely they should just look at a baby's date of birth and realise that they will be too young to leave. 'I think mothers with children under the age of one should be exempt from the service.' The news was universally condemned by those who support breastfeeding mothers. Anna Burbidge of the international charitable breastfeeding support organisation La Leche League GB, said the situation was appalling and being told to give a bottle showed a complete lack of understanding. She said: 'For one thing the mother's health would be put at risk because of the danger of mastitis from not feeding and her milk supply would be disrupted. 'Many breastfed babies will not take a bottle and in addition, will be very distressed in being away from their mothers. Aileen Robertson said there needed to be clearer guidelines on new mothers' responsibilities on juries . 'We would agree that the needs of a baby to be breastfed should always be paramount and that this need to be made clear. 'Mothers are, in effect, being told they must withhold their babies' food from them - and this would be considered completely unacceptable in any other circumstances.' Rosemary Dodds, senior policy advisor with the National Childbirth Trust, added: 'If a mother decides to breastfeed her baby, the judicial system needs to respect her choice. 'Society needs to do much more to support women in their feeding decisions.' A Scottish Court Service spokesman said: 'No formal application has yet been received. It is completely incorrect to say that the application has been declined on the grounds of breastfeeding. 'Dunfermline Sheriff Court was contacted by a potential juror advising that she was breastfeeding and unable to do jury service. 'She was advised about jurors being excused for medical grounds who take preference and to contact her surgery and obtain something in writing. 'The right for automatic excusal from jury service is listed in statute. Anyone else wishing to be excused is normally asked to submit their reasons to the court for consideration and to include any relevant supporting documentation for consideration. 'The Sheriff Clerk will then consider those applications sympathetically but in some circumstances the court may not be able to excuse individuals where to do so would prejudice the conduct of court business. 'It is not our policy to request a medical certificate to support a request for excusal on the grounds of breastfeeding.' The spokesman said the court had an appropriate room available for those who required privacy in order to breastfeed. According to the Equality Act of 2010, it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. However, the incident comes after mother Lou Burns, 35, was asked to cover herself as she breastfed her baby in Claridge’s hotel in December last year. The mother of three was left humiliated after staff at the five-star Mayfair hotel gave her a giant napkin to cover up as she fed her 12-week-old daughter Isadora during afternoon tea in December last year. Lou Burns, 35, was breastfeeding her 12-week-old baby (left) at the luxury Claridge's hotel in Mayfair in December last year, when waiters asked her to cover up with a large napkin (right) to avoid 'causing offence' to fellow guests . Mrs Burns, who is married to comedy actor Nick Burns, was reportedly told by staff to use the napkin to avoid 'causing offence', but said she was left humiliated and burst into tears afterwards. At the time, she said: ‘I was really shocked as I had never experienced this before. Through my tears I tried to explain that I was really quite cross.' She criticised the hotel’s ‘Victorian’ policy and the incident led to a mass breastfeeding protest outside the five-star Mayfair hotel. The demonstration, organised by Free to Feed - which campaigns for the 'normalising' of public breastfeeding - saw dozens of mothers brave freezing conditions to sit outside the hotel's grand front doors and feed their infants. Protest: A group of about 40 mothers took part in a demonstration outside the five star Mayfair hotel following the incident . Classical musician Kathrine Jenkinson was banned from taking her 11 month old baby into the exclusive Oriental Club in central London, because no under 12s were allowed in. She had hoped a babysitter could look after the child in her dressing room while she played Haydn’s Piano Trio in G major at the exclusive Club. Instead, the babysitter had to wait outside the venue in December last year, with Olivia Grace and Miss Jenkinson, 34,  had to leave the building during the interval to feed her baby. Classical musician Kathrine Jenkinson was banned from taking her 11 month old baby into an exclusive London hotel . Meanwhile in August Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told by a lifeguard at Middleton Pool that she could not breastfeed her five-month-old daughter Olive because it was 'classed as eating and drinking'. In June 2014, a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant. Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan. Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there. Around 70 women descended on Sports Direct in Nottingham city centre in April last year to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son. She claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'. The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room.

"A species of mosquito capable of transmitting a deadly disease have been found thriving on marshes in the Thames Estuary. Colonies of culex modestus, which can spread the West Nile virus in one bite, have been discovered by scientists at sites across North Kent. The virus, which killed 286 people in America in 2012, can cause flu-like symptoms that last several days, and in serious cases can cause swelling of the brain and spinal cord. Scroll down for video . Experts from Public Health England have collected samples of the species at wetland sites across north Kent - including two on the Isle of Sheppey (pictured) There is currently no vaccine against the infection, which can also lead to a fatal form of Meningitis. Experts from Public Health England have collected samples of the species at wetland sites across north Kent - including two on the Isle of Sheppey. A call for risk assessments to be updated has since been sparked after the killer insect was found thriving on the island, which is largely marshland on the Thames estuary. According to an article published in the Parasites and Vectors journal, an average of 27.97 adult mosquitoes were caught each night at a barn and a field in Elmley and an average of 26.17 of them – nearly 94 per cent – were culex modestus. Dr Jolyon Medlock, from Public Health England, said: ‘Culex modestus seems to exploit the ditches in the north Kent marshes, and owing to the large number of wild birds and farm animals, there is sufficient blood source to sustain populations.’ But the West Nile virus disease, and the similar Usutu virus, were not detected in any samples taken in the study. However, the scientists behind the study have warned the abundance of the insets highlights the need to look again at it potentially reaching the UK . There have only been four cases confirmed in the UK since 2002 - three in people returning from North America and one in a person returning from the Middle East - and no one has ever contracted the disease in the UK. The mosquito can be found in many parts of the world including China, Russia, Spain and Poland, and unlike other species, it is not tropical. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds and can then spread the virus to humans and other animals they bite. The virus cannot be spread from close person-to-person contact - for example, by kissing someone who is infected. Although migratory birds, which are also monitored, are known to land on Sheppey after returning from warmer countries, so far none has been known to carry West Nile virus here. It is not certain how culex modestus reached the area, and previous surveys between 2001 and 2003 found no reported evidence of it being here. Its population in the region appears to be increasing as a previous study from 2010 reported 75 per cent of adult mosquitoes were culex modestus. The West Nile virus, pictured, which killed 286 people in America in 2012, can cause flu-like symptoms that last several days, and in serious cases can cause swelling of the brain and spinal cord . The latest survey, carried out during the peak months of July to September in 2013, showed the species accounting for 90 per cent of all samples collected on the marshes. But this could be down to numbers varying from year to year depending on the weather. Dr Medlock added: ‘This species is recognised as a potential vector of West Nile virus, and that is why increased survey effort has targeted the region.' Last year, public health experts ramped-up efforts to detect mosquitoes capable of carrying potentially lethal diseases by building detection stations at ferry ports in Southern England. Experts fear the culex modestus and Asian tiger mosquito, which can spread dengue fever, may enter the country due to the increasingly mild conditions.","Culex modestus have been discovered by scientists 50 miles from London .

"Milena Gagic was killed after she ventured onto a railway line and was struck by a train at 55mph . A 16-year-old schoolgirl was accidentally killed by a train after she sat down between a set of railway tracks to talk to her best friend. Milena Gagic happily ventured onto the line just after midnight with friend Amelia Hustwick when she was hit by the last Manchester Victoria to Leeds Northern Rail at around 55mph. The straight A student, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, who was tipped for a place at Oxford or Cambridge, suffered fatal injuries in the impact and died at the scene on December 13. An inquest heard the pair had ventured onto a public crossing near Hipperholme tunnel after a night with friends and decided to sit down for a chat as they believed the last train had already passed. The girls, who had been friends since they were babies, had visited a Costcutter store that Friday evening to buy ingredients for baking before spending time at the home of Amelia's brother. They left at 10.30pm to go back to Milena's house to get some food before meeting some more friends at a nearby park. In a statement Amelia, also 16, said: 'We had arranged to meet two friends. However they went home and Milena and I went over to the park on our own. 'We then decided to walk along the main road to the train tracks because it is quiet. We have been there on three occasions in the past. It was quite late so we didn't think trains would be running. 'We sat between the tracks on the crossing. We sat there laughing and giggling. We were sat facing each other in between the tracks.' But shortly after a train came hurtling down the tracks and only Amelia was able to jump out of its path. She added: 'It was going fast but I am not sure how fast. I didn't hear a train horn. I assumed Milena had jumped out of the way because I couldn't see her anywhere. Milena and her best friend Amelia Hustwick had been enjoying a night with friends when they decided to sit between the track (pictured) for a chat, thinking that the last train would have already passed . 'I looked to my right and could see her 10 metres away in track where the train had passed through.' Amelia tried to revive her best friend whilst waiting for emergency services to arrive on the scene. She said: 'I have known her my whole life and consider her to be my best friend. We are both the same age, 16, and I would describe us as two peas in a pod. 'I cannot recall my first encounter with her but mum and dad say I have known her since birth. 'We spent all our time together and I would describe her as my favourite person in the whole world. She was a lovely person and her family became a family to me. 'Milena and I went to the level crossing because we find it a nice place to hang out. I believe it was an accident. Neither of us had consumed any alcohol.' A post-mortem report confirmed Milena died from massive head injuries and that a toxicology report showed no traces of alcohol and drug misuse. Her mother Leanne a director for Leeds City Council told the Halifax inquest: 'On Friday 12th December Milena was at home with me and her dad at 18.10pm. 'We were sat around the table eating a meal and Milena left the house to meet her friend Amelia. 'Milena returned home at 23.20pm. I was up stairs asleep in bed and woken by her. I could smell perfume and smoke on her clothes. Milena was a straight A student had been studying A Levels when she died on December 13. She was tipped for a place at Oxford or Cambridge University after being chosen for a scheme . 'I asked her to put her clothes in the wash because I could smell smoke. I do not recall her responding and I fell back asleep. She added: 'I would like it noted that she was a straight A student. She had achieved fantastic grades in school and had been chosen to go on a scheme for Oxford and Cambridge. 'She was a very sensible, diligent caring individual who would never with any intent put herself at risk. She was not under the influence of anything at the time of her death.' Northern Rail train driver Martin Jones, told the inquest that he had 'felt a small bump' as he passed the crossing but had not initially suspected he had hit anyone. He said: 'I was on full power and the train was nearing 55mph. I didn't sound the horn because there is a time requirement and you can only do so between 7am and 11pm. I felt a small bump.' The inquest heard that Milena was a sixth form student studying A Levels at Crossley Heath School in Halifax. An inquest heard that Amelia was able to jump out the way of the oncoming train but Milena (pictured) didn't and suffered fatal injuries in the impact . She had confided to Amelia that she had been teased by bullies at her previous school but was happy at Crossley Heath. In a statement Wendy Moffat, headmistress at Crossley Heath, said: 'Milena was a wonderful, bright, talented girl who had a great future ahead of her. 'She was so excited to be studying for A-levels at Crossley Heath and she made a really positive impression upon everyone who taught her. 'We're devastated and she will be missed so much by her friends and the whole school community. 'Our thoughts, best wishes and sympathy are with Milena's family right now.. We are so desperately sorry for their loss and will do everything we can to support them through this.' West Yorkshire Coroner Oliver Longstaff issued a warning about the dangers of loitering on railway lines as he recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: 'There is no indication that this should be anything other than a tragic end to a happy evening. 'I am satisfied that Milena and Amelia went onto the tracks without thought of doing themselves harm. 'They had had an evening with friends and they were doing something they had done many times before. It was possibly not a very wise thing to do but nobody is on trial here. 'The warnings on the crossing are there to be seen - ""stop, look, listen"" and they did not have to sit between the tracks, it is a remarkable thing to have done but the completely unexpected occurred in tragic consequences. 'Milena would have had absolutely no idea what happened to her.' He added: 'I have considered whether to make a report to see if anything could be done to prevent future deaths because of pedestrian crossings on railway tracks. West Yorkshire Coroner Oliver Longstaff issued a warning about the dangers of loitering on railway lines as he recorded a verdict of accidental death . 'My view is that if there is a public road or way over a rail way track then that railway authority are very limited as to what they can do to prevent access and as a matter of law they cannot prevent access. 'There are warnings to stop, look and listen on either side. It is clear that the girls thought the last train had gone. 'Whatever steps that might be taken cannot legislate that someone would choose to sit between the tracks.'","Milena Gagic ventured onto line after midnight with friend Amelia Hustwick .

A schoolboy who fell into a freezing river while playing with his younger brother was yesterday feared to have drowned. Cameron Comey, 11, has not been seen for more than two days after falling off the bank of the River Towy where he had been playing on Tuesday close to home with nine-year-old Anthony. The younger boy rushed home to their mother, Amanda, 39, in Carmarthen, West Wales, to raise the alarm after watching as his brother was swept into the water. A massive man hunt involving helicopters, the RNLI and the coastguard was continuing, but rescuers had still not found him last night.

"A serial shoplifter who was compared to Little Britain's Andy after she leapt out of a wheelchair to steal food has been jailed. In scenes reminiscent of the BBC comedy show Leoni Clare was captured on camera being pushed around a service station by her very own Lou on the A45 near Coventry, West Midlands. When other shoppers backs were turned, the 28-year-old jumped out of the seat and started stuffing £60 of meat into her rucksack. The unemployed 28-year-old admitted three counts of theft when she appeared before magistrates without the assistance of her wheelchair. Scroll down for video . I want that one: Clare was caught on CCTV being pushed into the service station in a wheelchair only to get up when other shoppers backs were turned . The 28-year-old then jumped out of the seat and started stuffing £60 worth of meat into her coat and rucksack . Andy and Lou became popular after Little Britain was first screened in 2003. Matt Lucas played Andy, who feigned disability and let his hapless carer, Lou, played by David Walliams, run around after him. The sketches were made famous by Andy's catchphrases; 'yeah, I know', 'I want that one' and 'don't like it'. Ninda Gill, prosecuting, told Coventry Magistrates Court that Clare had been referred to as the 'Little Britain thief' following the crime on January 11. 'The defendant, who was in a wheelchair and being pushed by a man, entered the BP garage,' she said. 'The defendant stood up from her wheelchair and picked up a selection of cold meats. 'She left the store without paying. 'The incident was captured on CCTV and has since been used by police in their appeals. 'The media have described it as 'Little Britain thief' so it has got a lot of attention. Clare, who has a string of previous convictions, also stole perfume worth £28 for a chemist and a further £25 worth of meat from Marks and Spencer on separate occasions. Stefan Hunka, defending, said that Clare has to 'learn to stand on her own to feet.' 'She is a single lady, residing with her mother who is also not in the best of health,' said Ms Hunka. 'Her grandmother is extremely poorly Running alongside that, she is not working. Her antics led to her being dubbed the Little Britain thief and compared to the characters Lou and Andy. She was jailed for 14 weeks by magistrates . 'She was in hospital for six weeks in relation to a blood clot in her leg and was discharged earlier in January. 'She committed the third offence whilst on bail, which is why she is in custody today. 'She has to learn to stand on her own two feet and realise that there are many people outside this room who have the same problems but do not commit crime.'# . Sentencing, chairman of the bench Graham Holloway said: 'We have listened carefully to what our prosecution and your solicitor have had to say. 'However the bench feels we have been backed into a corner and we have no option to activate the previous suspended sentence imposed some time ago.' Clare, who was wearing a grey hooded jumper, sobbed as she was jailed for 14 weeks. As she was led away a member of the public hurled abuse at the bench of two men and one woman. Clare, from Coventry, was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £20.

"Bamboozled: Californian Bobbie Beale was left scratching her head after she started being abused online by EastEnders fans . A Californian teenager called Bobbie Beale who had never heard of EastEnders was swamped with abuse on Twitter last night from people demanding to know if she was a killer. More than a million tweets were sent during the BBC soap's live episodes, which revealed that 11-year-old Bobby Beale killed sister Lucy by hitting her over the head with a jewellery box. But some of the messages were aimed at the American Bobbie, who thought she was being accused of murdering her dog Lucy. For some time she was left bewildered after receiving a number of accusing messages from fans of the soap. She wrote at first: 'Why are 3 people from Scotland that I don't know, tweeting me about killing someone named Lucy?' The messages from the UK continued with a mystified Miss Beale asking: 'Who are you?' and explaining she was a not a boy. She then posted a selfie alongside the hashtag #IdidntKillLucy. She said: 'I starting getting tweets in the afternoon. It was pretty confusing because I thought they were talking about by dog Lucy. 'I looked up the show and I thought, Oh, this makes sense now, but at first I was really confused because I thought it was a real-life thing and I thought Bobby Beale killed someone and I was like, ""It's not me"".' 'I got 1,500 new followers and 15,000 retweets. I was in class and my phone died because of all the notifications. 'I have definitely not killed my sister and definitely not killed my dog'. The nation, gripped by the mystery of Lucy Beale's murder, shared its thoughts on the twists and turns of the two episodes, climaxing in more than 30,000 tweets in the single minute after Bobby was revealed to be the killer. Mistaken identity: Bobbie Beale is an American student and Bobby Beale is a fictional character revealed as the killer of his sister last night . First tweet: Bobbie Beale first asked her followers why people in Scotland said she was a killer . Response: In the face of hundreds of tweets Miss Beale began trying to inform followers of the mistake . Fears: Initially she thought trolls from Britain were for some reason accusing her of killing her pet dog Lucy . Last month American Twitter users ITV political editor Tom Bradby by people who'd confused him with NFL star Tom Brady . Thousands abused him over 'deflategate' - a row over ball pressure in a key NFL match. EastEnders tweets climaxed during the second episode with 519,359 tweets posted as the killer came closer to being unmasked, data from social analytics firm Kantar Social TV UK showed. National Grid also reported a spike in activity during the broadcast: 'National Grid control saw a 500MW pickup in elec demand for £EELive part 1 & 300MW for part 2.

Maggie Simpson did it. £EELive' The hot topic quickly became the top tending item on Twitter, with fans all over the country using #KillerReactions to respond to the BBC One soap's shocking plot twist. One fan tweeted: 'Every person in the country with a younger brother is sleeping with one eye open tonight.' Another tweet that quickly went viral was a picture of Bobby wearing a cap with the caption 'I'm real Bobby Shmurda. Straight savage from Walford,' playing on the name of American rapper Bobby Shmurda. Exchanges: The tweets began arriving at around 9.30pm uk time when it emerged that Bobby was the killer . Confused: But Miss Beale was still struggling to comprehend why people were so interested in her account . Another quick-off-the-mark fan even set up a 'Bobby Beale' parody account immediately after the revelation. The account tweeted: 'I remember the day well... Was high off some orange juice. That blonde cow doing my nut in... It was time for her to go.' Another tweet read: 'Yeah, I'm white, ten and a cold hearted murderer. Lucy Beale? Nah man, never heard of her.' 'Looking for a lawyer who specialises in Murder. If you have any information, call my old man. Money ain't a factor.'

"Well past its prime the dilapidated Grade II listed Victorian landmark at 95 Piccadilly in London is set for a rebirth as a four-bedroom residence that will boast a price tag of £70million. The exclusive location overlooking Green Park, and the fact Buckingham Palace is a close neighbour, are among the reasons that justify such an eye-watering sum for the building that was most recently the members-only American Club. But in its heyday, the building was among the most impressive homes in London and part of the same Piccadilly Estate that was home to the Duke of Cambridge between 1829 and 1850 and Lord Palmerston during his term as Prime Minister. Grade II-listed Victorian landmark, 95 Piccadilly, is set for a rebirth as a four-bedroom home worth £70million . The exclusive residence overlooks Green Park and is on the other side of the park to Buckingham Palace . It became The American Club soon after the group's first meeting in 1918 and the men's only clique for US expats remained tenants until the 1980s, when a long-running fixed rental lease expired. Despite being a grand icon of Victorian architecture, the former home built in the early 1800s has been empty for almost 30 years and in recent times has looked worse for wear. Water ingress, dry rot and vermin infestation have left the Mayfair mansion in 'poor condition' and with 'extensive damage', hardly befitting the grand company it keeps. But along with the neighbouring In and Out Club, the main part of the Piccadilly Estate at No 94, No 95 was bought by the billionaire Reuben brothers as part of a £130million deal in 2011 and they now have approval for significant works to be carried out. Paul Davis and Partners have been commissioned to redevelop 95 Piccadilly and return it to its original purpose as a single family home with four bedrooms. Planning permission has been granted by Westminster Council to completely refurbish the home, change the layout and create a new basement level which will feature a swimming pool and spa. While in bad condition, the historic fabric and plan form of the principal rooms remain largely intact, many of which have grand features including impressive fireplaces, high ceilings and a stunning central staircase. Along with the neighbouring In and Out Club, the main part of the Piccadilly Estate at No 94, No 95 was bought by the billionaire Reuben brothers as part of a £130million deal in 2011 . A beautiful central staircase remains in impeccable condition but the place over all is significantly rundown . When completed, 95 Piccadilly will have a passenger lift, while an additional staircase will be built to access the new basement, which will include a swimming pool, lounge, gym and spa. The basement will feature a large kitchen and dining room, wine cellars and staff accommodation. The ground floor has the grand entrance lobby, and reception room along with the sitting/media room. All these rooms are dominated by huge pillars and high ceilings. When completed, 95 Piccadilly will have a lift, and an additional staircase will be built to access the basement . The American Club, a men's only club for US expats, occupied by the building from 1918 to the 1980s . On the first floor, there is a principal front room, rear dining room, a pantry and study while the second floor will be one giant suite and boast a huge master bedroom, which has its own private living room, a walk-in wardrobe, two bathrooms and a master study. There are three further super-sized bedrooms - all of which will have large en-suite bathrooms and dressing rooms - on the third floor, while the top floor will have a family room and outdoor terrace. This image of the study shows the extensive water damage and dry rot in the house . The result will be a four-bedroom home worth around £70million, making it 400 times more expensive than a typical house in England and Wales, with stamp duty expected to be in excess of £8.3million. Becky Fatemi, managing director of Rokstone estate agency, is certain the property will be stunning when ready. She said: 'I think we're talking about it being a £70million home and that's being conservative. The refurbishment will be to a very high standard and you're overlooking the park. This is what people are looking for. 'To refurbish a place like this, you'll be looking at spending between £800 and £1,000 per square foot and this includes furniture. 'It is likely whoever wants to buy will want to be able to move straight away. They want an ease of life. ""Turnkey"" properties allow this.' David and Simon Reuben, who are worth around £9bn, have made a fortune in the property market. When complete, that property which has also been known as Egremont House, Cholmondeley House and The Naval and Military Club, is expected to be able to fetch more than £200million and take the crown as London's most expensive home. Before World War II, the road was known for its private homes. Number 145, which was destroyed during the war, was a 25-bedroom mansion which was the childhood home between 1927 and 1937 of HM Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret. After World War II, due to the lack of offices in the City of London, Piccadilly became a commercial road lined with hotels, the Japanese Embassy, offices and plush clubs. Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Mayfair estate agency Wetherell, believes the area is being transformed back into a prime residential area. A sketch dated 1885 of the first floor dining room at 95 Piccadilly, once one of London's grandest homes .

He said: 'Booming residential values are driving the transformation of the thoroughfare back into a super-prime residential address with a series of trophy properties, super-luxury apartments and penthouses in the pipeline. 'These mansions also provide great economic benefits through refurbishment and architectural restoration, the trickle-down effect of wealth does work in property restoration.' Fatemi added it would be difficult to say who exactly will be looking to buy a home like 95 Piccadilly with the mansion likely to have a broad appeal to the wealthiest home buyers. 'Mayfair isn't typical of most prime areas of London,' she said. 'I don't think you can categorise exactly who might buy it. You don't just get super-rich Middle-Eastern and Russian buyers. 'There are also a lot of UK and American buyers who will be interested in a home like this. 'What is interesting about properties like this one is that they were originally very grand residences and they are being returned to their original purpose. 'Mayfair, in particular, is going back to what it was like in the 1800s. 'At the moment I have three to four people looking for £50 million-plus homes but there is a shortage of choice. I think when this will be completed, it will be stunning. An uber home.'","95 Piccadilly will become a four-bedroom home worth £70million .

"Former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell had tears in her eyes as she was sentenced Friday to a year and a day in federal prison after what the judge referred to as a 'tragic, sad and puzzling' case. This after McDonnell supporters testified she is a thoughtful woman devoted to her family, but who was overwhelmed by her political role, prior to her sentencing in a public corruption case that destroyed her husband's career. McDonnell may now become the first modern-day governor's spouse sent to prison for felonies she was convicted of committing while she held the mostly ceremonial position. She will however remain free on bond while her appeal is pending, much like her husband, who was previously sentenced to two years in prison for his role in their actions. Scroll down for video .

She added; 'I started a chain of events that brought embarrassment on us all.' US Attorney Jessica Aber also spoke before the sentencing, saying; 'Corruption in government is not normal.' She then added; 'Harsh penalties must be imposed on public officials who accept bribes and on those who assist them in accepting bribes,' before referring to McDonnell's actions as 'opportunistic greed.'

'It doesn't matter who you are, it effects everybody,' Anne Carey said about the Ebola virus which has claimed almost 10,000 lives across parts of west Africa . The 'violent and deadly virus', which has threatened the population of West Africa, has seen already more than 23,000 people infected, with at least 10,000 known to have died from the causes of Ebola. As a volunteer for the Red Cross, Anne is currently on her third trip to the high-risk region, and describes the deadly Ebola crisis as 'an unfair bully'. ‘Sometimes you have to take the bullies on, and win,' she told reporter Michael Usher. Anne recalled the first patient she ever saw just as she had stepped inside a treatment centre, set up especially to treat Ebola patients. 'I got dressed up in the protective suit and there was a mother with her four-week-old child, and that child as soon as I came into the centre it convulsed, so it fitted, and it proceeded to bleed from everywhere and it just bled to death,' the nurse recalled.

"A cyclist killed in a collision with a tipper lorry in central London was a French-born mother-of-two. Claire Hitier-Abadie, 36, died in an accident with a lorry at a busy junction in Victoria during yesterday morning's rush-hour. It was the fourth cyclist death in London so far this year, with lorries being involved in all of the incidents. Claire Hitier-Abadie, 36, pictured, died after her bicycle collided with a tipper lorry in Central London . Witnesses said that the lorry, pictured, began to move around the corner when it struck Mrs Hitier-Abadie . Mrs Hitier-Abadie worked in Grimsby for six years before returning to Paris in 2008. She moved from Paris to London last year with her husband Pierre, who works for Total Gas and Power at Canary Wharf in London's Docklands. A colleague of Mr Abadie wrote on Twitter last night: 'Absolutely devastated. My colleague's wife was killed while cycle commuting this morning, crushed by a lorry. 'The boss came over to tell us as we all work on an open floor. It's awful at work. Who does her husband hug and cry with?' The lorry had been driving along a one-way street close to Victoria tube station in south west London at 8am yesterday morning when it struck the woman on the inside lane at a set of traffic lights. Mrs Hitier-Abadie was found unresponsive at the scene on Victoria Street, which has been covered by a makeshift tent by officers, and she was pronounced dead on arrival. Witnesses described seeing the bicycle being crushed under the second set of wheels of the Gordon Plant Hire truck as it attempted to turn left at the junction. Another cyclist is said to have jumped in front of the lorry to stop it moving further, but Mrs Hitier-Abadie had already suffered fatal injuries. Carnel Jarca, a 42-year-old Big Issue seller, was stood opposite the crash when it happened. Mrs Hitier-Abadie was declared dead at the scene of the crash outside Victoria Station in London . Witnesses said the lorry's driver, who is in his 50s, looked 'devastated' following yesterday's incident . He said he saw the driver - a man he believes to be in his fifties - get out the truck wearing a hi vis jacket and looking 'devastated'. He said: 'I heard this horrible metal on metal sound and then I saw this other cyclist come in front of the lorry and wave at the driver. 'He had already stopped, but he stopped it moving any more. He had been sat at the red light and he had only just moved off. The corner is just too tight for a bike and a lorry together. 'The driver came out of the lorry and asked the cyclist what had happened. He looked under the lorry and just put his head in his hands. 'He looked totally devastated and astonished. He was in complete shock, I think he was horrified. 'He just went and sat at the side of the road with his head in his hands. There was nothing anyone could do. 'The other cyclist went to help as well but it was too late, she was under the wheels I think. The police, ambulance and fire brigade all turned up very quickly and started shutting off the road.' Des Dacosta, a maintenance engineer who approached the junction shortly after the accident, said: 'I could see the bike all mangled under the wheels. 'I didn't want to look at the cyclist because I could tell it was a really serious accident. 'I work around here a lot and it's a very busy junction, all day and all night, it is relentless. It's just tragic, another cyclist killed in London.' The incident happened at 8am yesterday as the lorry and Mrs Hitier-Abadie travelled down Bressenden Place (arrow shows direction of travel) but collided as they turned a corner onto Victoria Street (shown on map) Police confirmed that nobody has been arrested in connection with yesterday's tragedy . Metropolitan Police said the driver was stopped at the scene but no arrests have been made. The incident is being investigated by the Serious Collision Investigation Unit and officers are now appealing for witnesses. Roadworks at the site have been in place since May 2011 as Victoria station undergoes extensive improvement works, with the project due for completion in 2018. The crash is the fourth fatal incident to involve a cyclist in London so far this year and highlights the danger for those hoping to get around the capital on a bike. On January 20, 29-year-old Stephanie Turner, a physiotherapist, was killed in an accident with a lorry in Stamford Hill in north London. Then on February 2, music producer and sound engineer Akis Kollaros, 34, died after a collision with a lorry in Homerton in east London. This morning's fatal accident on Victoria Street is the fourth involving a cyclist in 2015. Stephanie Turner, 29, was killed in an accident with a lorry in Stamford Hill, north London on January 20. Almost a fortnight later, on February 2, music producer and sound engineer Akis Kollaros, 34, died in a collision with a lorry in Homerton, east London. Four days after his death, 26-year-old fashion designer Federica Baldassa was killed in London's Bloomsbury square following an accident with a lorry. The spate of deaths so far this year is already above the average number nationally - a normal January would see 9.8 cyclist deaths across the country. Nationwide there was 13 deaths in the first two weeks of 2015. The total London cyclist death figure for 2013 was 14. Four days later, 26-year-old fashion designer Federica Baldassa was killed after an accident with a lorry in London's Bloomsbury Square. AA president Edmund King said: 'Sadly, this tragic death bears all the hallmarks of the ""typical"" London cycle death - a female cyclist killed by a tipper truck turning left. 'These cases continue despite the AA's Think Bikes Campaign, the Metropolitan Police ""changing places"" initiative and other Transport for London and Department for London campaigns. 'We have distributed more than six million Think Bikes stickers to drivers to put on their side mirrors to remind them to think bikes but obviously much more needs to be done to stop this carnage.' The spate of deaths is already above the national average - a normal January would see an average of 9.8 cyclist deaths nationally. Cycle safety in London came to the fore in the autumn of 2013 when there were six cyclist deaths in the capital in just two weeks. But the total London cyclist death figure for 2013 was 14. Carnel Jarca, a Big Issue seller, who was stood opposite the crash when it happened, said: 'I just heard this big sound, a crash, the sound of crushed metal' Overall in 2013 nationally, there were 109 cyclist deaths, including six children, 3,143 serious injuries to cyclists and 16,186 slight injuries, making a total of 19,438 casualties, including 1,958 children. Figures from Transport for London last month showed that cycling in the capital is now at record levels, having grown by 10 per cent in the last year. Bicycles now make up 16 per cent of traffic in central London and 25 per cent at peak times on key routes. Police said the driver was stopped at the scene but no arrests have been made in relation to the incident.","Claire Hitier-Abadie, 36, died instantly following yesterday's tragic crash .

"The  gunman who killed two people in Copenhagen was today buried in a Muslim cemetery in the city, despite objections from the Islamic group that owns it. Omar El-Hussein, 22, murdered two people last weekend following a bloody rampage through the Danish capital that ended when he was killed in a shootout with police. The ceremony at the Islamic Society of Denmark was attended by approximately 500 mourners and sympathisers, before he was buried in a Muslim cemetery on the outskirts of the city. Mourners: Stewards surround the hearse carrying the body of Omar El-Hussein, who murdered two people last weekend following a bloody rampage in Copenhagen . Coffin: The car was escorted from the Islamic Society's building in Copenhagen to a Muslim burial ground in the suburb of Brondby . Final journey: Ahmet Deniz, head of the Islamic Burial Fund's support group  said he had concerns before the ceremony about the burial . But Ahmet Deniz, head of the Islamic Burial Fund's support group told newspaper Jyllands-Posten, that he had concerns before the ceremony about the burial. He said that the group said it had considered denying a request by El-Hussein's parents to have him buried in their cemetery, but that its rules did not allow for it. He added: 'My concern is over extremist attitudes and actions on both sides. Both from his friends and from young Danish people who perhaps could also riot later.' The funeral was open to the public, but reports from the scene said it was mostly attended by young men, who were described as 'wearing large black coats with many of them having covered their faces'. Before the ceremony, Copenhagen Police urging anyone attending to 'show appropriate respect' while Kasem Said Ahmad, who conducted the burial ceremony, said that he would require everyone to 'remain silent'. Ahmad rejected  suggestions that a large turnout at the funeral would be a sign of support for the alleged killer. He said: 'It is support for the family, not for him. I do not think that anyone is coming to pay homage to him.' After the burial, controversial Salafist Adnan Avdic - who had previously called El-posed for pictures at the the plot. Two people - a documentary maker and a volunteer security guard at Copenhagen's main synagogue - died in two separate shootings last Saturday and Sunday. Coffin: Mourners carried El-Hussein's white coffin on their shoulders to the grave . Pose: Outspoken Salafist Adnan Avdic (R), who arrived with his own photographer, poses next to El-Hussein's grave . Plot: Controversial Avdic had previously called El-Hussein a 'hero' following the terror attack . Prayer: The funeral prayer was so well attended that many people had to stay outside the building . Soon afterwards, El-Hussein was then killed in a firefight with police which concluded a shooting spree that authorities say may have been inspired by the terror attacks in Paris last month. El-Hussein first gunned down film director Finn Nørgaard at a free speech debate in the city, but it is believed his target was Lars Vilks, a Swedish artist who has received numerous death threats for caricaturing the Prophet Muhammad. After fleeing the scene, El-Hussein then appeared nine hours later outside a synagogue in Copenhagen where he fired nine rounds with two hand guns, killing Jewish security guard Dan Uzan and wounding two police officers. Killer: El-Hussein, who was well known to police for violence and weapons violations, was killed in a shootout with police in his neighborhood of Norrebro, Copenhagen, following the attacks . Cemetery: The funeral was open to the public, but reports from the scene said it was mostly attended by young men, who were described as 'wearing large black coats with many of them having covered their faces' Burial: Kasem Said Ahmad, who conducted the burial ceremony, said everyone would be required to 'remain silent' amidst fears of protests . El-Hussein was carrying two handguns when he was shot by a SWAT team early Sunday. A Denmark native with Palestinian parents, El-Hussein had been in and out of prison for violence and weapons offenses and had recently served time for a stabbing on a commuter train, court documents revealed. Video emerged last week of El-Hussein competing in a Thai kick-boxing bout two years ago, looking toned and athletic. Highly-skilled, he was known as ‘The Captain’ and hoped to turn professional. Instead, he started smoking marijuana heavily and became involved in tit-for-tat battles with rival gangs in the poor areas of Copenhagen. Murdered: Finn Norgaard, 55, (left) was killed at a free speech debate in a cafe hours before 37-year-old Dan Uzan (right), a basketball player, was shot in the head as he guarded the door of a Bar Mitzvah . Fighter: Copenhagen terrorist Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein (left) competes in a kick-boxing match in February 2013 . In November 2013 he stabbed a man of 19 in the thigh and buttock on a train in an unprovoked attack. He was sentenced to two years in prison for grievous bodily harm – where he became radicalised. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service, known by its Danish acronym PET, acknowledged this week that El-Hussein was flagged in September under a program meant to alert PET to 'inmates who are at risk of radicalization.' What prompted prison authorities to sound the alarm is unclear, but PET said that the information gave the agency 'no reason to believe' that he was plotting attacks. Earlier this week, Denmark's Prime Minister joined mourners at the funeral of Mr Uzan as hundreds gathered to pay their respects to the slain security guard.","Omar El-Hussein, 22, murdered two people last weekend in Danish capital .

"Wooden boats loaded with tourists cause a massive traffic jam at Thailand's famous Damnoen Saduak Floating Market, a historic collection of vendors that has become completely over-run by tourists.

Located about 60 miles west of Bangkok, this traditional floating market is a place where tourists can buy locally grown fruits and vegetables . Vendors paddle along the congested canals selling their produce, such as bananas, papayas, corn, cabbage and onions . Originally, the canal was dredged to connect the Taachin River and the Maklong River, during a time when transportation was almost motionless. Today, many people live along both sides of the canal - the majority of whom are farmers who grow oranges, grapes, papayas, cabbages and onions. There are countless  floating markets throughout the country, though this one is particularly noteworthy for its colourfully-clad merchants and congested canals. Bargaining is common practice as individuals selling souvenirs and food paddle along the water in sturdy canoes, but prices are often only negotiable by a few baht. Steeped in history, these floating markets were traditionally the only way that vendors could transport their goods from city to city . It's common practice to bargain prices down, though most are not negotiable by more than a few baht .

"In an incident guaranteed to make every man cringe, an Oklahoma resident woke up early Thursday to discover his girlfriend trying to bite off his penis after a lovers' quarrel. The victim’s girlfriend, Amber Ellis, 31, of Tulsa, was arrested on charges of maiming and assault with a dangerous weapon in connection to the near-dismemberment. Her unfortunate boyfriend, who has not been named, was rushed to a hospital were doctors were able to stitch up his mauled genitals. Woman scorned: Amber Ellis, 31, did not take it well when her boyfriend told her she had become needy, so she reportedly responded by attempting to bite off his manhood as he slept . According to a police report cited by the local station KJRH, the man said he and Ms Ellis were out drinking Wednesday night, and on the way home they got into an argument 'about how needy she had become.' The couple continued trading verbal jabs upon returning to their apartment in the 7600 block of East 49th Street in Tulsa, until finally the 31-year-old woman stormed off to the bedroom and shut the door behind her. Her boyfriend, who was described in the report as an amputee, according to Tulsa World, dozed off on the couch in the living room. In the early hours of Thursday morning, the man was awakened by the sensation of teeth chomping on his privates. The man was able to fight Ellis off, but the scorned girlfriend, who stands at 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 120lbs, allegedly slammed him in the head with a laptop computer. The injured boyfriend was taken to St John's Medical Center, where he received four or five stitches to the base of his manhood. The near-dismemberment took place at the couple's home in the 7600 block of East 49th Street in Tulsa Oklahoma, early Thursday morning after the duo returned from a night out drinking . He was also treated for bruises to his head, face, neck, fingers and knee. At around 2.30pm, Amber Ellis was arrested and booked into the Tulsa County Jail on $25,000 surety bond. This was not Ms Elllis' first run-in with the law: she landed in jail in late August on a domestic abuse charge.","Amber Ellis, 31, of Tulsa, Oklahoma, charged of maiming and assault with a dangerous weapon .

"A blind man finally caught a glimpse of the loving wife who acted as his guide for over a decade after being fitted a bionic eye. Allen Zderad screamed with happiness when Carmen came into focus, before embracing his wife and erupting into tears of joy. The man from Forest Lake, Minnesota suffered from a genetic disease called retinitis pigmentosa which stole his eyesight over the course of his life according to Kare. Now thanks to a pair of electronic glasses which send signals to the electrodes planted in his damaged retina's, the 68-year-old has finally been able to see his wife and ten grandchildren again. Regarding the device which took over £200million and decades to develop, he said: 'It's crude but significant, it works.' Scroll down for video . Elation: Allen Zderad (left) screamed with joy the moment he saw his wife Carmen (right) for the first time in over a decade, thanks to bionic glasses which cost over £200million to develop . Loving partner: Carmen (left) cared for her husband Allen (right), who lost his sight to a genetic eye disease known as retinis pigmentosa which gradually wore away his retina . The glasses have not perfected Allen's vision, but they do allow him to perceive shapes and light. Mr Zderad, whose genetic disorder progressively wore away his retina, became the first Minnesotan and 15th person in the country to receive the technology. He remembers the faces of his older grandchildren, but has never seen most of them. Before the device was switched on, he said: 'I have a lot of fun with my grandkids and family. 'I think it would be good to recognize when they come in the room, and observe their growing and things like that. 'My grandkids in Oregon love playing hide and seek. They don't have to hide anywhere except for a corner of a room,' Zderad joked. The bionic eye, known as the 'Second Sight Argus II' acts as a retinal prosthesis and was finally approved for use by the Food and Drugs Administration in January 2014 - after decades or research. Retinal surgeon Dr Raymond Iezzi who selected Mr Zderad to receive the bionic eye said: 'It's a bionic eye, in every sense of the word. It's not a replacement for the eyeball, but it works with interacting with the eye.' He equipped his patient with a pair of dark-tinted sunglasses with a camera on the bridge and a fitted computer which sends information to the electrodes implanted in Zderad's retina - which replace the damaged cells. Breakthrough: The glasses worn by Allen took decades to develop and send electrical impulses to electrodes fitted to his damaged retinas . Step by step: The glasses do not perfect Allen's vision, but they allow him to perceive shapes and light . On the mend: Before receiving the treatment, Allen joked: 'My grandkids in Oregon love playing hide and seek. They don't have to hide anywhere except for a corner of a room' Once the glasses were turned on, Zderad exclaimed: 'It's the flash and I've got to be able to interpret the changes in that shape.' Dr Iezzi added: 'Mankind has been seeking to cure blindness for 2,000 years or more, but only in the past quarter of a century have we had the electronics and the packaging and all the other things come together to build a retinal prosthesis that could restore sight to the blind.' Two weeks after these pre-operative tests, Zderad was surrounded by his loving family in the Mayo Clinic when the glasses were turned on again. 'His whole life we have heard ""nothing can be done, nothing can be done"" - it's all we've heard, until now,' said Carmen Zderad. Dr Iezzi is already planning on implanting the device in a second patient, while researching future uses for patients who have other eye conditions besides retinitis pigmentosa, like patients with glaucoma, or soldiers who may have lost their eyes in combat. In a healthy eye, the rods and cones convert light into tiny electrochemical impulses that are sent through the optic nerve and into the brain, where they are decoded into images. If the photoreceptors no longer function correctly the first step in this process is disrupted, and the visual system cannot transform light into images. The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System (""Argus II"") bypasses the damaged photoreceptors altogether. A miniature video camera housed in the patient’s glasses captures a scene. The video is sent to a small patient-worn computer (i.e., the video processing unit – VPU) where it is processed and transformed into instructions that are sent back to the glasses via a cable. These instructions are transmitted wirelessly to an antenna in the implant. The signals are then sent to the electrode array, which emits small pulses of electricity. These pulses bypass the damaged photoreceptors and stimulate the retina’s remaining cells, which transmit the visual information along the optic nerve to the brain, creating the perception of patterns of light. Patients learn to interpret these visual patterns.","Allen Zderad suffered from genetic eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa .

"A breakdown mechanic fixed a 50-year-old Land Rover with a potato. AA patrolman Mario Papademetriou made the ingenious repair after being called out to a farm in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire. Initially, he tried to fix the broken condenser on the 1960s vintage Land Rover using tin foil and silicone repair tape, but this failed. Mr Papademetriou, 59, from Chingford, Essex, said: 'As the vehicle was on a farm, there were a lot of vegetables around, so I thought I'd try wiring up a potato with a couple of screws to act as a condenser. AA patrolman Mario Papademetriou wired up a potato with a couple of screws to act as a condenser . 'Amazingly, it started instantly, so I followed the owner to the garage and he said the vehicle had never driven so well!' The owner made the 12-mile journey to the garage where the ignition system was properly repaired. Mr Papademetriou's ingenuity saw him win the AA's annual competition for most innovative roadside repair. AA technical director, Donald MacSporran, said: 'AA patrols work on pretty much any vehicle on the road and pride themselves on their ability to fix them. 'While they regularly go the extra mile with some very inventive repairs, we continue to invest in their training and equipment to maintain our leading fix rate. 'Although vegetables are best left on the dinner plate, Mario's use of a potato was definitely a chip above the others - an excellent example of thinking outside the box.'

"Have you noticed Rachel and Ross sounding slightly high-pitched in reruns of Friends episodes? If so, it could be because your TV network is speeding up these classic shows to squeeze in a few more seconds of advertising time. The sneaky tactic has been highlighted in a YouTube clip which shows the speed difference between an original copy of a Seinfeld episode and a recent TBS rerun. Scroll down for video . The sneaky tactic has been highlighted in a YouTube clip which shows the speed difference between an original copy of a Seinfeld episode and a recent TBS rerun . Pennsylvania-based company Prime Image uses a tool known as Time Tailor. The technology analyses both the video and audio programs and drops segments of video and audio which contain identical or 'like' information to that of the neighboring segment. A five per cent time reduction means that a 15 second commercial can be inserted into a five minute program . In the YouTube video, the increase in playback speed in the footage would allow for two additional minutes of commercials in a single half-hour episode. Other methods of time reduction work by playing a pre-recorded program from a tape machine faster than normal speed. These methods have the adverse effect of altering the audio's pitch and requires pitch-correction technology to prevent people from sounding like chipmunks. The increase in playback speed in the footage would allow for two additional minutes of commercials in a single half-hour episode. Viewers have also noticed the change, with many reporting that their much-loved characters sound subtly different. TBS is believed to have sped up sitcom reruns of 'Seinfeld', and Viacom Inc's TV Land used the same tactic with 'Friends' reruns, according to a report by Joe Flint at the Wall Street journal. And it isn't the first time TV networks have tried to shorten reruns. Similar techniques include cutting the opening sequence, speeding up the closing sequence and overlapping the next show. For instance, reruns of 'Law & Order' on TNT have a 24-second opening, compared to the original 1 minute, 45-second opening when it aired on NBC. Pennsylvania-based company Prime Image uses a tool known as Time Tailor to shorten sitcoms. The technology analyses both the video and audio programs and drops segments of video and audio which contain identical or 'like' information to that of the neighboring segment. 'This method is unlike anything available in the market today, the company claims. 'By design, this process does not affect the pitch of the audio. Other methods of time reduction work by playing a pre-recorded program from a tape machine faster than normal speed. 'That method has the adverse effect of altering the audio's pitch and requires pitch-correction technology to prevent people from sounding like chipmunks.' it said. But the trick could ultimately back fire, experts claim. 'It is important for us to consider the effect this is having on the viewer experience,' Jackie Kulesza, executive vice president and director of video at Starcom USA told Wall Street Journal . A&E Network averaged 18 minutes and 39 seconds of commercial time per-hour in prime time, which is up three minutes from December 2013, according to an analysis by Nielson.

For years, there have been rumours of Apple launching a TV - with Steve Jobs even famously telling his biographer the firm had 'cracked' the problem. However, now it appears the firm's plans may finally begin to be seen outside the company's super secret Cupertino labs. It is believed to be talking to TV programmers about a streaming service that could rival Netflix. It say the service would put together bundles of programming, rather than entire TV lineups. Instead, it could offer its own system, possibly with new ways to interact, with its own interface and user experience. Apple has shown programmers demos of the proposed service, sources told re/code. 'But talks seem to be in the early stages, which means terms like pricing and timing aren't close to being ironed out.' The History Channel, meanwhile, had 18 minutes and 42 seconds of ad time, up two minutes from the previous year. Other networks accused of speeding up reruns include, TBS the Discovery Channel and TLC. According to the Wall Street Journal a senior executive at one major cable programmer said the speeding up of shows, which is done by removing repetitive video frames, is a last resort. However, the source said the practice, which has gone on for decades, seems to have become more prevalent in the past few years. Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman is believed to have described the practice as 'wrong', claiming that her work has been manipulated to appear in a way that she had not intended. The change comes at a time when advertisers are cutting their spending on able networks by an estimated four per cent, as they move their money to web-based sources. Last year, it was revealed that Procter & Gamble, the largest U.S. ad-buyer, and General Motors among the companies scaling back their television advertising. While cable networks had been strong in overall television ad business, those owned by media companies such as Time Warner , Walt Disney Co, 21st Century Fox and Viacom Inc have suffered sagging ratings lately. 'Digital has finally begun to take a bite out of national TV budgets,' said one media buyer.

'I’m kind of sad, and it’s really great to be here tonight and listen to all of you, and listen to the great work that you do and be reminded why we live in this bizarre planet called ""Hollywood.""' The death is being investigated as a possible drug overdose, and the Los Angeles County coroner's office will determine the exact cause. In the past the comic writer has spoken of his battle with addiction and has checked himself into rehab twice. The night before he was found dead, Wittels performed a stand-up set at The Meltdown comedy theater in Los Angeles. On stage, Wittels joked about being clean and sober and said that at this point in his life he was in a good place. Billy Eichner, who plays highly-strung character Craig Middlebrooks on the show, said: 'Don't know what to say. Harris Wittels was a fantastic writer I had the pleasure to work with at Parks and Rec. So so sad. RIP Harris.' In an outpouring of emotion, comedian Sarah Silverman praised and chastised Wittels, calling him 'brilliant beyond compare', but adding that she was 'so mad at you Harris.'

That his imagination was without limit. That he loved comedy more than anything. 'That his heart was big and he FELT hard. That he was someone who would reach out and tell you he was thinking of you for no particular reason. 'That he was honest if it was going to piss you off or make him look s*****. He told the truth. Even when it was ugly. Even when he lied.' Wittels had worked closely with Miss Silverman on her own self-titled show, which ran from 2007 to 2010, as a writer. Parks and Recreation, which won a Golden Globe for Miss Poehler and was nominated for a host of other accolades, is wrapping up its six-year run next Tuesday. In the tradition of great movie directors such as Alfred Hitchcock and Quentin Tarantino, Wittles also made eight appearances in his show as a dim-witted pest controller. He initially started as co-producer on the NBC show, before rising to co-executive producer. The talented comic was spotted by Sarah Silverman who saw him perform stand-up in 2006 and gave him a writing job on her Comedy Central series. He is also credited as the man behind the term 'humblebrag,' and even published a book called 'Humblebrag: The Art of False Modesty,' in 2012. 'It was bragging, but it wasn't just bragging,' he wrote. 'It was a type of bragging that included some amount of fake modesty, which somehow made it acceptable to do.' Wittels had been in rehab twice and had opened up about his struggle with addiction on the podcast WTF with Marc Maron . Wittels, pictured here with actor Paul Reiser, had worked on several comedy shows and was also credited as the inventor of the term 'humblebrag' The book was partially based on his social media presence, as he ran a massively popular Twitter account with more than 85,000 followers. He was also a regular guest on the podcast Comedy Bang Bang where hosted a segment called Harris' Phone Corner and read jokes he'd texted himself. 'Just call half-and-half' one,' The Verge recalled one of the 'mostly terrible' gags. Variety notes that Wittels had openly discussed his past struggles with narcotics, notably on the Marc Maron podcast WTF. Wittels was also set to perform with a musical trio called Don't Stop or We'll Die on February 28 at the UCB Theater. Wittels played drums in the band alongside fellow comics Michael Cassady and Paul Rust. Originally from Houston, Texas, Wittels started doing stand-up in junior high, moving to Los Angeles immediately after graduating from Emerson College in 2006 to start his comedy career. After sending a video of himself performing to the Upright Citizens Brigade, he earned a place on its most popular show, 'Comedy Death-Ray.' He was also a fixture at the popular comedy club Largo.

"Nathan Harrison, aged four (pictured) died after accidentally starting a fire with a utility lighter he mistook for a toy while hiding under a bed . A four-year-old boy died after accidentally setting fire to his makeshift den during a game of hide and seek with his brother, an inquest has heard. Nathan Harrison, from Keighley in West Yorkshire, died after he found the lighter which he 'mistook for a toy'  and accidentally started the fire. The incident took place on August 11 last year while he was hiding under the bed. The polyester duvet quickly caught fire and filled the room with toxic black smoke. His horrified mother Jodie Collins, who had been using an exercise machine in the garage while her sons played, discovered the fire and pulled the little boy out of the bedroom. A heartbreaking statement read to Bradford Coroner's Court heard how she wrapped Nathan up in a towel as she carried him out of the house. The statement said: 'I sat on the driveway cuddling him in my arms. It was at this point I believed he had died.' Nathan was rushed to nearby Airedale Hospital, but despite the best efforts of medics he died from the effects of inhalation. The court heard his brother Matthew, aged 10, had taken the utility lighter from the top shelf of the pantry at the family's home and placed it under his bed to look at later because he thought it 'looked like a gun' and he 'wanted to shoot it out of the window'. After finishing her exercise Ms Collins had gone upstairs to shower when she noticed Matthew's bedroom door had blackened around the top. Believing her sons to be playing outside and not having her mobile phone on her, she ran out of the house to raise the alarm with her next door neighbour. She returned to the house to find the boys, but her shouts couldn't be heard over the sound of the smoke alarm. The house where the blaze took place in Keighley, West Yorkshire (pictured). Nathan accidentally started the fire in his big brother's bedroom during a game of hide and seek while he was hiding under the bed . After disabling the alarm she saw Matthew at the bottom of the stairs and asked him where Nathan was, and Matthew replied he had gone to the toilet. After finding the bathroom empty Ms Collins went into Matthew's room to find it engulfed in smoke. She twice tried to enter the room but was unable to breathe properly due to the toxic fumes. She then grabbed a towel to cover her mouth and ran into the room, where she found Nathan collapsed at the foot of the bed. In a statement read out to the court, Ms Collins said: 'I grabbed one of Nathan's limbs and dragged him out of the room, banging his body on the floor. 'I was too dizzy from all the smoke to carry him. After I got him out I wrapped him in a towel and carried him outside. 'I sat on the driveway cuddling him in my arms. It was at this point I believed he had died.' When investigators examined the lighter used by Nathan they found that the safety 'off' position that prevents it igniting had been switched to the 'on' position. Ms Collins' statement described the strong bond between Matthew and Nathan. 'Matthew adored Nathan. In fact he mothered him and we often had to set boundaries to curb this mothering,' her statement said. The fire spread to bedding which turned into toxic smoke and prevented Nathan from getting out of the room . Recording a narrative verdict about the incident, senior coroner for West Yorkshire Martin Fleming said: 'Nathan was a very much loved son, grandson and brother. 'Tragically Nathan came into contact with the lighter and plainly the four-year-old mistook that for a toy. 'The naked flame spread to the bedding which turned into toxic smoke and prevented the little boy from getting out of the room.' Mr Fleming added he would look into making recommendations aimed at making utility lighters harder to use for young children.","Nathan Harrison, aged four, died after accidentally setting fire to his den .

"More than $150,000 has been raised for the funeral of a toddler who died after wandering away from his grandmother's Toronto apartment in the bitter cold. Elijah Marsh was found in a nearby backyard on Thursday morning - six hours after leaving the building wearing just a T-shirt and diaper as temperatures plunged to -4F (-20 C). The little boy was rushed to hospital and police announced his death several hours later.

'I was constantly saying, “You are eating, aren’t you Lily? Let’s get Lily some soup please!” These gowns were beautifully crafted and they produced shapes that were very extreme.’ Miss James, best known for her role as Lady Rose MacClare in Downton Abbey, said she did have to ‘squeeze to within an inch of my life’ to get into the corset. However, fans watching the movie’s trailer online were less convinced. American actress Sarah Ann Masse said: ‘This isn’t a normal human-sized waist, right?’ Another blogger wrote: ‘She has apparently undergone rib removal surgery along with losing the majority of her internal organs from aggressive corsetry or Photoshop. I’m not sure which.’ After the latest trailer for the live-action feature was released last month, many people took to Twitter with comments about the tiny waist. Backlash: People took to the internet to debate whether the look was down to a corset, or photoshop magic . 'I have a problem with the fact that Cinderella is photoshopped to have the tiniest waist I've ever seen,' tweeted @vixennicks. 'Cinderella and her digitally remastered teenie tiny waist is the reason for my confidence issues.' A representative for Miss James told Buzzfeed this week that the look was achieved by a corset. Lily attended the world premiere of Cinderella last Friday night, at the Berlin Film Festival, and looked more proportionate in real life than as the Disney Princess.

"A Manchester high school has been ridiculed for erecting a sign boasting of its students' achievements in English only for the poster itself to contain a glaring spelling error. Chorlton High School placed the huge sign at the front of the school to celebrate its students' 2014 GCSE success rates in English and Mathematics. But what staff didn't realise was that the sign claimed 67 percent of students had 'ganied' good GCSEs in the two subjects. Pictured are the signs celebrating the students' GCSE results, with the offending error visible top left . Chorlton High School admitted there had been a 'slip up' with the spelling and said it was being corrected . Next to the embarrassing banner were other posters - all spelt perfectly - which described the school as 'a centre of excellence for the arts' and boasted of its position within the top 100 schools for the greatest 'sustained improvement in GCSE results'. One bemused onlooker, who did not wish to be named, described it as 'unbelievable'. He said: 'It must have been pretty recent because there were workmen looking at it trying to take it down. 'They're bragging about their success in English and Maths but there's a spelling mistake. It's unbelievable. 'I was shocked. Going back to your school days you are told ""check, double check"" and in the days of computer spell checking - it's amazing. 'The fact that the sign is obviously bragging about their success in English, it's ironic that they've put a spelling mistake there. 'I'm sure the school is going to blame the printers and the printers are going to blame the school.' The irony of the spelling error was not lost on Twitter users who were quick to share photos of the sign . This Twitter user was left speechless after seeing a photo of the poster online . It wasn't long before other eagle-eyed locals spotted the error and quickly shared it on social media. James Swift tweeted: Chorlton High School excelling at spelling as well as exam results. Some proof reading gone amiss here.' Matt Burney responded: 'Wow... not really much to be said there!' After being approached by MailOnline, a spokesman for the school admitted there had been a 'slip-up'. He said: 'This was obviously a slip-up, which we are correcting, but it shouldn't detract from our students' achievements.'","Chorlton High School erected sign boasting of its students' GCSE success .

Scroll down for video . Millionaire comedian-turned-anarchist Russell Brand has been shortlisted for the World Thinkers 2015 award . Prospect magazine's managing editor Jonathan Derbyshire oversaw the team putting together the list. Speaking to the London Evening Standard, he said: 'His [Brand's] nomination was the cause of one of the more lengthy and intense discussions.' The magazine's description of Brand calls him 'the spiritual leader of Britain’s disaffected anti-capitalist youth'. It adds: 'In October he published Revolution, a manifesto for the radical redistribution of wealth and power. Dismissed by his opponents as a clownish opportunist and even a hypocrite due to his own wealth, he is nevertheless the most charismatic figure on Britain’s populist left.' The magazine was quickly criticised for shortlisting Brand. Writer David Oldroyd-Bolt tweeted: 'It's utterly perverse. Russell Brand? Nothing more than a Dickensian demagogue.' Brand joined the likes of Hilary Mantel and Henry Kissinger on the 50-strong list of great minds . Mike Durham added: 'Prospect Magazine rates Russell Brand as one of the world's top thinkers. I assume this is a joke.' Student Henri Rapson tweeted: 'The fact that Russell Brand is even an option here discredits it from the beginning.' Prospect's poll caused controversy in 2013 when Richard Dawkins took the crown, only to be ignored by the magazine the next year. While Brand might be considered an outsider to win, he has more than nine million Twitter followers who could all cast a vote.","Russell Brand has been shortlisted for the World Thinkers 2015 award .

The eye-watering spending splurge amounts to nearly £31,450 a day or 236,675 licence fees. The Corporation ran up a taxi bill of £10.7million in 2011-12, £11.8million in 2012-13 and £11.9million in 2013-14. It includes more than £200,000 to pay for cabs ordered, only to be cancelled on arrival and additional fees charged by drivers left waiting outside.

The figures, released following a Freedom of Information request, are taken from the Corporation's central booking system. But staff can also book taxis themselves and claim the money back on expenses, meaning the BBC's full taxi is spend will be even higher. A BBC spokesperson said: 'More than a third of taxis are to get guests to and from shows and many journalists and columnists are happy to use them when they appear on our programmes. We also make sure staff get home safe when they finish working in the middle of the night.' The BBC has broken down around 16% of the £34.4million by department, but refused to do so for the remaining 84%, which includes radio, TV and news. Of the £5.4million it was willing to detail, nearly £63,000 was spent on taxis cancelled on arrival, which accounted for 1.5% of bookings. Additional charges for waiting were added to 11% of bookings at a cost of £171,000. The departments covered in the breakdown are BBC Monitoring, Finance and Operations, BBC Trust, Strategy and Digital and BBC Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. They racked up a combined 252,746 journeys at an average cost of £21.40 each.","The spending amounts to nearly £31,450 a day or 236,675 licence fees .

"Two tourists were arrested at an airport in Thailand as they tried to smuggle an incredible 144 exotic animals out of the country. Customs officers were stunned when they opened the suitcases of Naoki Hiraguchi and Toshikazu Kawai, both 39, and discovered the haul of rare wildlife. The pair were trying to smuggle 110 pig-nosed turtles, four woodchuck, 21 snakes and nine geckos from Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok to Nagoya in Japan. Shock: Thai customs officials were shocked when they realised the two men had 144 animals squeezed into their suitcases . Caged: This woodchuck was one of four that Toshikazu Kawai and Naoki Hiraguchi, both 39, were trying to smuggle from Thailand to Japan . Wildlife: The two men had a total of nine geckos in their luggage when they were stopped at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok . Turtle: One of the 110 turtles the men were caught with. They claimed they wanted to raise exotic animals at home and also give some to their friends as souvenirs of their trip . Khanit Isadul, a senior customs official who led the search, said the two Japanese men confessed that they had bought the animals at Chatuchak weekend market for about £10,000. They  claimed they wanted to raise exotic animals at home and also give some to their friends as souvenirs of their trip. The smuggled wildlife were listed as endangered species in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. The seized animals would be handed to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation and other relevant agencies, said Mr Khanit. Confiscated: Thai customs official displays a confiscated pignose turtle and a gecko caged inside a plastic bottle during a press conference at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok . Rare: The rare pig-nosed turtle is under threat, as demand for the reptile is in high demand from pet traders . Demand: Thailand is one of the world's biggest hubs for wildlife trafficking and illegal trade of animals in the country is rife . Thailand is one of the world's biggest hubs for wildlife trafficking, but in recent years, the country has tried to shed its reputation as a source and destination for exotic meat and rare pets. But demand from China, including for tiger parts and ivory tusks, has fuelled a thriving trade in illicit wildlife. Animal rights activists have also expressed concerns about the welfare of animals at tourist attractions across Thailand, which has popular elephant camps, monkey shows and tiger farms. Illegal trade of animals in the country is rife, as wildlife parts are often used for traditional east Asian medicines. Also today, the World Animal Protection also revealed that 150 pangolins were saved from a cruel fate as they were being smuggled to China via Thailand. They were seized by the Thai Army. The trade in pangolins is conducted primarily to satisfy demand for their scales, which are believed to have strong medical benefits in traditional Chinese medicine.

"With a protruding chest bone and super skinny arms, this is the incredibly slim mannequin being used by high street store Whistles. The shocking picture was taken by a passer-by of a window display of the brand's Angel store in London. It shows the thin-looking mannequin wearing a floaty white top. In response to this photograph, which was taken this week, eating disorder charities have called for shops to take more responsibility for setting standards. The Duchess of Cambridge is a fan of Whistles and was pictured wearing one of the brand's burgundy dresses. Snapped: This is the shocking photo of a mannequin that was spotted in the Whistles store in Angel, London . The Duchess of Cambridge is a fan of Whistles and was pictured wearing one of the brand's burgundy dresses in London in 2013 . Mary George from Beat, the UK's leading charity supporting those with eating disorders, said: 'It is disappointing to see such an obviously underweight mannequin in the high street. 'This stereotype can be extremely harmful to some and while the fashion industry doesn't directly cause eating disorders- it has a powerful influence that is highly toxic to some vulnerable young people. 'We call on retailers to recognise the responsibility they have to use this influence in positive, life enhancing ways. Fashion can be fantastic- creative, aspirational and fun. 'What we need is a mixture of different heights and widths of mannequins in our shops to reflect the reality of people's different shapes and sizes, heights, widths and build.' Amina Hays, who took the photograph of the mannequin after spotting it in Upper Street brand of Whistles, said she found it 'revolting'. The 32-year-old said: 'There has been so much uproar with the fashion industry not representing 'real' women I thought idiocies like this had been abolished. 'I'm a size eight and this made me feel fat which is just not acceptable.' Marg Oaten MBE, the secretary and co-founder of SEED Eating Disorder Support Services, told FEMAIL: 'Without doubt the mannequin is not a realistic reflection of a body size and shape. 'It is outrageous to portray this as acceptable – people may aspire to this body shape whilst people with an eating disorder, may in fact consider themselves not thin enough. Controversy: Whistles has come under fire from eating disorder charities for using super slim mannequins . 'I really do think the retailers have a duty of care to its shoppers to be more realistic in the size of the model or mannequins that they use to showcase their goods.' Marg went on to say: 'Often people who are low in self-esteem have a false belief that by managing body weight and shape they will be happier, in truth they may plummet to dangerously low levels in weight that may cause them to be medically at risk. 'People need to be comfortable in the skin they are in – and celebrate the difference in body weight and shape. She added: 'Promoting clothing in this way can be highly dangerous to potential sufferers of anorexia nervosa. 'An eating disorder has the highest mortality rate of any other mental health illness with a staggering 20 per cent of people dying each year from their illness or through suicide. 'Manufacturers and retailers need to take more responsibility for their actions and consider the consequences of how this may impact on people suffering from an eating disorders.' Gina Hutchings, a part time plus model said: 'I do not think the fuller figure has made its way to high fashion yet which is sad as fuller figured women can be just as stylish as slimmer women. 'The high street usually means clothes everyone can wear so it’s disappointing to see this mannequin used by Whistles. 'Skinny shaming is now as bad as fat shaming and as talked about but Whistles are failing to show a healthy figure.' In October student Becky Hopper posted this image of her friend standing next to a Topshop mannequin with stick thin legs . More women with normal sized legs posed next to the Topshop mannequin. The store said it was not meant to represent a real woman . MailOnline has contacted Whistles for comment. This is not the first time a high street store has come under fire for using a mannequin that is considered too thin. In October, Topshop was slammed for using using mannequins with stick thin legs with student Becky Hopper sharing a picture of her friend posing comparing her legs to those on the model. The image was shared more than 7,000 times .A Topshop spokesman said the mannequin was ‘based’ on a size 10. ‘The form is a stylised one to have more impact in store and create a visual focus,’ said the spokesman. ‘Mannequins are made from fibreglass, so [they] need to be of certain dimensions to allow clothing to be put on and removed. This is therefore not meant to be a representation of the average female body.’ Over the last decade, campaigners have been fighting back against a series of fashion and online trends they say encourage eating disorders. A row over so-called 'size zero' models was sparked in 2000 when the British Medical Association linked an obsession with 'abnormally thin' models on TV and in magazines with the rise in conditions such as anorexia and bulimia. Madrid Fashion Week banned models with a body mass index below 18.5 from its catwalks in 2006 in what was seen as a victory for campaigners against size zero. But later that year, Paraguayan model Luisel Ramos was found dead from a heart attack linked to malnutrition and six months later her sister, model Eliana Ramos, 18, died in similar circumstances. Their deaths were used to highlight the pressure on models to meet a demand for unnaturally thin young women. Campaigners have hit out over the use of 'size zero' models on catwalks and have linked the desire among women to emulate the so-called 'thigh gaps' of models like Cara Delevingne (right) to eating disorders . Last year, internet craze 'thinspiration' - where people post photographs of their emaciated bodies on social media to 'inspire' weight loss - was also blamed for encouraging eating disorders. Susan Ringwood, from charity Beat, said: 'Those pictures are very unlikely to be real. 'They are digitally manipulated to make the bodies shown appear extremely emaciated. Altered pictures of famous people are often included too.' A further craze by girls to emulate model's 'thigh gaps' erupted earlier this year when experts warned it was further fuelling the issue. Nancy Albus, head of a facility which deals with sufferers in St. Louis, USA said: 'The intrusion and presence of social media in our lives really does make it very difficult. 'The important distinction about thigh gap is it gives you an actual visual to achieve, this visual comparison of how your body does or doesn't stack up.'","An incredibly thin mannequin was spotted by a passerby in London .

"A young gym enthusiast collapsed and died after eating a cereal bar after a workout – because exercise brought on a severe allergic reaction to nuts. Maisie Durant is believed to have suffered from a rare condition known as exercise-induced anaphylaxis, where physical exercise sparks a severe and potentially fatal allergic reaction. The 21-year-old had always had a nut allergy, but controlled her mild symptoms with over the counter medicine. After going to the gym she picked up a cereal bar to take home to eat, without realising it contained nuts - to which she was allergic. Scroll down for video . Maisie Durant, 21, collapsed and died after eating a cereal bar she didn't realise contained nuts - to which she was allergic. It is believed she suffered from a rare condition known as exercise-induced anaphylaxis, where physical activity sparks a fatal allergic reaction . Miss Durant had been diagnosed with a nut allergy and asthma as a child, but had controlled the allergy using over the counter medicine Piriton. Before her death, she had never had a severe allergic reaction before. She is pictured, left and right, before she died . Miss Durant, a Royal Holloway University graduate, did not know exercise can worsen nut allergies because it causes the blood to pump faster around the body. She is pictured, left and right, during her university years . When Miss Durant got home she collapsed, was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, but died in front of her devastated father hours later. Experts say exercising can worsen the symptoms of nut allergies because it causes the gut to become 'leaky'. This allows the allergens to be passed into the blood faster, and blood to be pumped around the body more quickly. Now her father, Jonathan, 58, has spoken about his daughter's death. 'Maisie's normal nut allergy control just didn't work because she'd been exercising,' said Mr Durant, who lives in Chiswick, West London. 'Fitness was something she'd taken up more recently. 'Maisie had always taken tablets for allergies, whereas in reality, she should have had an EpiPen and been educated on the risks of exercise. 'What I'd like to see is everybody with allergies be fully equipped and fully educated.' Mr Durant, who lived with his daughter in Chiswick, West London, said he will never be able to forget watching her collapse and die. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis is where physical exercise sparks a severe and potentially fatal allergic reaction. It can also worsen  the symptoms of allergies. During anaphylaxis,   the body’s immune system over-reacts to an allergen, triggering the release of the chemical histamine, which can affect the airways and mucous membranes (lips and eyes) and cardiovascular system. Dr Stephen Till, a consultant in adult allergy at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust in London said this allergic shock can be made worse by exercise. He said: ‘The exercise involved can be moderate - one patient suffered anaphylaxis when pushing her baby’s pram up a hill - and in many different forms, from labouring on a building site or dancing in a nightclub to taking a walk or going for a run.' But it’s thought that the more the person exerts themselves, the stronger the reaction. Dr Till added: ‘One patient, a triathlete, reacted to something she had eaten the night before a race.’ Why exercise should spark anaphylaxis is unknown, but there are theories that it increases the permeability of the gut, changes the way the blood vessels react to allergens or has an effect on the body’s neuroendocrine cells (specialised nerve cells that produce hormones such as adrenaline). Heat, alcohol, anxiety and mental stress are also thought to exacerbate the problem. He said: 'She was grabbing for her pills for the nut reaction and then it became clear it was a shed load more serious,' he said. 'I'm not sure anyone can possibly understand what it's like to watch that take place.' He called 999 and paramedics arrived but she died in hospital hours later. 'It was horrible,' he said. 'The health service did a great job but it was all too late. 'Now I want to warn people about exercise and allergies.' He said Miss Durant had suffered from a nut allergy since she was a young girl, although no one realised the severity of it. She took over-the-counter Piriton tablets to control it, but was not prescribed an EpiPen as she had no history of severe allergic reactions. Mr Durant said his daughter was a bright, fun and generous girl. He said: 'She was fun-loving and the centre of party attention, but also blossoming out for her own career. 'If she walked into a room full of strangers, she could handle that. 'She was also very bright. She liked having fun but there was also a serious, generous side to her. 'If she wanted something, she worked for it.' Her family have set up a JustGiving page, and since Miss Durant's death, donations have flooded in. So far more than £45,000 has been pledged to The Anaphylaxis Campaign, from both those who knew and loved Miss Durant, and strangers who have been touched by her story. Her father said: 'Some people who we don't know have been immensely generous , just because they've got a son or daughter who has come close to the same fate as Maisie. 'We want to help protect other people from this.' Her funeral took place on February 4 in Chiswick, and colleagues from her job at recruitment company Reed organised a minute's applause in tribute to her. When she was 16, Miss Durant became an organ donor, so after her death she went on to save the lives of three others – including two kidney failure patients who've been on dialysis for five years. While her family have not been told the names of the people who have received her organs, they have been informed that all three are currently in good health. 'That gives you a great indication of what Maisie was like,' Mr Durant said. Mr Durant said his daughter was bright, generous and confident. He said: 'She was fun-loving and the centre of party attention, but also blossoming out for her own career. She is pictured (left), with her friend Lillie (right), before her death . Miss Durant's  colleagues from her job at recruitment company Reed organised a minute's applause in tribute to her (pictured) 'There was a fun side to her but there was also a serious and generous side to her. 'She had a boyfriend, Chesney, and they were planning to go to Berlin together. 'Life was turning into quite an exciting place for her. She had a magnificent mix of focus, fun and heart.' A spokesperson for the Anaphylaxis Campaign said: 'When someone goes into anaphylactic shock, we recommend they lay down, put their feet up, and don't walk around or do any type of movement, because this pumps the blood around the body, so Maisie exercising could've played a part.' An inquest is set to take place in due course. To donate, visit Miss Durant's Just Giving page.","Maisie Durant, 21, had controlled her nut allergy with over-the-counter pills .

"While cinema-goers  flock in their droves to see Fifty Shades Of Grey, a gaggle of women have taken a different approach to mark the release. Thousands have been harassing a man they believe to be the real-life Christian Grey. And he has no qualms about the comparison. 'I started getting messages from people I didn't know,' said Brayden Olson who, like Grey, is 27 and single. The real life Christian Grey? Brayden Olson (left) has received thousands of messages from women who believe he is the real-life version of the Fifty Shades Of Grey character played by Jamie Dornan (right) Award-winning entrepreneur: Olson's holding company for real estate, Wilhelm Enterprises, is titled after his middle name - much like Grey's self-titled firm Grey Enterprises in EL James's hit novel series . Leading figure: Like Olson, Grey is highly influential as one of Seattle's leading business figures . Women, he told Business Insider, have flown in from around the world. 'I knew the movie would bring more attention, but I continue to be really surprised by the whole matter.' He too is an award-winning entrepreneur based in Seattle, who is very rarely seen out of a suit. Like Olson, who is director of Washington Security Exchange, Grey is highly influential as one of Seattle's leading business figures . While Grey was named Seattle's most eligible bachelor, Olson has been named Seattle's 'best man'. His holding company for real estate, Wilhelm Enterprises, is titled after his middle name - much like Grey's self-titled firm Grey Enterprises. And though Olson doesn't have a Charlie Tango helicopter, he says he drives a BMW i8, which is a match for his fictional doppelganger's Audi R8. To the doubtless disappointment of many, he sidestepped comparisons with Grey's sexual antics. However, he told Business Insider, a girl he once dated told him he reminded her of Christian Grey. While Grey was named Seattle's most eligible bachelor, Olson has been named Seattle's 'best man' Though Olson doesn't have a Charlie Tango helicopter, his BMW i8 dwarfs his fictional doppelganger's Audi R8 . Numerous similarities include the fact he refers to most people as 'Miss' or 'Mr' - an eerie echo of the way Christian Grey says 'Miss Steele'. Olson has not met EL James, the British mother who wrote the book using Twilight fan fiction she posted in forums online, but he has now read all three and concedes the parallels are 'pretty mind-numbing'. But there are a few discrepancies - primarily that the fictional character is a billionaire who is at leisure to spend plenty of time outside the office. 'Christian Grey has got me beat,' Olson told Business Insider. 'He is a character from a book. I don't think a real person can compete. I claim to be the real Brayden Olson. 'I'm sure you can relate to how strange it would be to have a fictional character made up and so many things true about you in your real life.' 'Pretty mind-numbing': Olson admitted he was shocked by the sheer scale of similarities he shares with Grey . To the doubtless disappointment of many, Olson sidestepped comparisons with Grey's sexual antics . Olson claims he has not entertained the stream of  letters from women around the world that detail fantasies akin to the scenes in EL James' hit novel. But with the release of Sam Taylor-Johnson's movie adaptation, he is using the publicity to promote the domestic violence charities he works with. He tells Business Insider: 'It exists in every community and affects a significant portion of our society. 'I donate to my local domestic violence program called LifeWire, and I encourage others to become active in the conversation however they can. 'The line between choosing to show affection more non-traditionally as seen in Fifty Shades of Grey and moving into the category of domestic violence is consent and desire. 'Remember, Ana and Christian negotiated their contract in the boardroom!' Pictures of Brayden Olson provided by Kruse Photography.","Brayden Olson, 27, receives daily stream of messages from 'fans'

"These quirky wooden cottages allow you to up sticks and move at a moment's notice - as they are set on four wheels. The hand-crafted mobile homes are far more inviting than your bog-standard caravan and are incredibly eco-friendly. But motorists are unlikely to end up stuck behind one of the 22ft by 8ft homes on a west country-bound motorway as they are remaining at a farm where they provide holiday accommodation. The Meadow Keeper's cottage: Guests have likened this to a fairytale home because it has the appearance of a gingerbread house . The 22ft by 8ft cottage is made of about a dozen different types of wood - some from the farm and some that was reclaimed . Owners Sarah and Christopher Broadbent decided to make the two cottages movable structures to make it easier to get planning permission for them as they looked to diversify their farm business. Guests have likened them to fairytale homes, with Meadow Keeper's Cottage looking like a gingerbread house and Woodcutter's Cottage like something straight out of Little Red Riding Hood. The holiday homes are completely off the grid, with no electricity or running water inside. Each has a composting toilet nearby and a wood-fired shower just outside. But the cosy cottages are comfortably kitted out with a double bed, two singles that can also be used as benches, a log burner and a gas ring for cooking. The Broadbents, who own Swallowtail Hill Farm in East Sussex, decided to build the cottages and run glamping breaks to help cover the costs of running their conservation farm. After coming up with an idea of what they wanted, they recruited local carpenters, woodsmen and other artisans to help them create Meadow Keeper's Cottage. The project took about six months to build and sits between two wildflower meadows and next to a pond . The  cottage is made from about a dozen different types of wood - some from the Broadbents' farm and reclaimed wood such as hop poles that are used to grow hops on farms. It sits between two wildflower meadows and next to a pond. The project took about six months to build and was so successful that a year later they decided to build Woodcutter's Cottage, which took another six months. With similar proportions, it sits in its own secluded dell by a chestnut and oak coppiced woodland. The Woodcutter's Cottage is on wheels and is far more inviting than your standard caravan, eco-friendly and skilfully made . Taking six months to erect, Woodcutter's Cottage has been described as something straight out of Little Red Riding Hood . Sarah, 42, said: 'We wanted something unique to us. There are lots of places with shepherd huts, yurts and tents, so we wanted something different. 'My husband Christopher sketched some ideas and then we worked with some local craftsmen to create what we wanted. 'When we got planning consent it was easier to have them as movable structures. 'As the farm is run for conservation, it means technically if we wanted to clear everything away tomorrow we could and leave little footprint, but we plan on keeping them where they are. 'We're quite unusual in that we are a working farm run purely for conservation, but conservation doesn't earn a living so we had to come up with something that would cover our costs. Woodcutter's Cottage sits in its own secluded dell by a chestnut and oak coppiced woodland . Meadow Keeper's cottage  is based at a farm in East Sussex, providing holiday accommodation for those looking to get back to nature . 'It had to be something that fitted in with what we are all about, shared what we do with the public and worked in our surroundings. 'We came up with the idea for accommodation and we've been going as a glamping operation for five years now. 'People love the cottages and our repeat business is growing. The cottages are entirely off the grid, which is in keeping with our eco credentials. 'They have a little two-ring gas hob, their own firepits outside, composting loos and outdoor wood-fired showers. 'It's all part of the experience and we increasingly have families that want the chance to spend some quality time together and get the kids off the games consoles and mobile phones.' Prices vary depending on the season but start from £100 a night. Swallowtail Hill Farm also has two stationary wooden cabins. play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video .","Sarah and Christopher Broadbent decided on unique twist to the traditional glamping experience .

"Prince William felt he was being 'used' to further his father's interests and portray Charles in a positive light  after Princess Diana's death, an explosive BBC documentary has revealed. Sandy Henney, a former press aide to Prince Charles, described how his image was in tatters when she took up her post in 1993 as he was viewed as a 'bad father' and 'unloving husband'. In her first broadcast interview she described how Prince William was 'angry' about leaked details from his first meeting with Camilla Parker-Bowles and said it was a 'defining moment' for him. 'He (William) was understandably really upset because it was private. And apart from being angry and upset that this had got out, he wanted to know how it had happened,' she told Reinventing the Royals last night. Scroll down for video . Prince William (left) felt he was being 'used' to further his father's interests and portray Charles (right) in a positive light after Princess Diana's death, an explosive BBC documentary has revealed . 'It was a defining moment as he had recently lost his mother and he knew the role of the media in her life.' The Sun's former royal correspondent Charles Rae told the documentary that details of the meeting at St James's Palace in 1998 had been revealed by Prince Charles' former PR man Mark Bolland. 'We got all the details, her [Camilla] drinking the gin and tonic, her having a sneaky fag  beforehand because she was nervous and everything else. 'So all the detail came to us and was, if you like, absolutely kosher. Apart from Camilla and William telling us, you couldn't have got it from a better source… It was Mark Bolland.' Mr Bolland has denied he was behind the leak, branding the claims 'rubbish'. It was also claimed that a 17-year-old Prince Harry was left angry when another story about him having smoked cannabis appeared in the press. Sandy Henney, a former press aide to Prince Charles, described how his image was in tatters when she took up her post in 1993 . Royal biographer Penny Junor claims the story was 'not strictly true' and was spun into positive PR for Charles who sent the young royal to visit a drugs rehabilitation centre. 'A deal was struck, the order of events were reversed. It was spun it into a good story about Charles recognising his son had gone off the rails and doing something about it,' said Ms Junor. In the documentary Ms Henney, who worked for Charles from 1993 to 2000, also spoke of how she feared for the future of the monarchy in the face of public anger after the death of Princess Diana. 'I remember briefing one of our private secretaries on the phone and saying, 'I know you're seeing it on television but you really have to be here in London to feel the atmosphere. People here are really antimonarchy',' she said. 'I have to say, yeah, I was worried in terms of where was this going to go?' The programme also investigated the strategy for Camilla Parker Bowles to be accepted as a 'non-negotiable' part of Prince Charles' life - dubbed 'Operation Mrs PB' Tony Blair's spin doctor Alastair Campbell told the programme how he and the then prime minister helped the Queen and senior courtiers map out a strategy to soothe public rage. He said: 'The Lord Chamberlain said to Tony Blair: 'Were going to need some help on this.' I can remember saying it's very very important that she's there speaking not just as the Queen but as a grandmother.' The programme also investigated the strategy for Ms Parker Bowles to be accepted by the public as a 'non-negotiable' part of Prince Charles' life - dubbed 'Operation Mrs PB'. This strategy was masterminded by 'spin doctor' Mr Bolland who was private secretary to the Prince of Wales from 1996 until 2002. 'Spin doctor' Mark Bolland was private secretary to the Prince of Wales from 1996 until 2002 . He was also said to have helped with a book that claimed Princess Diana had the first affair and threatened to have Camilla killed, the author revealed as part of the documentary. Penny Junor, who was accused of smearing Princess Diana with her 1998 book Charles: Victim or Villain, told the show that Mr Bolland was a crucial source. The explosive book prompted public outrage when it was released because it questioned Diana's sanity and suggested she was the first to be unfaithful with a string of lovers, including a policeman. When asked how close she came to the royal family, she told the programme: 'I got very close. Bolland helped me with a lot of the book. 'I'm not saying he was the only source, he certainly wasn't the source for everything. He was the source for some things. It would have been a wholly dishonest book if he had been the only source. 'He was a genius he was very good at what he did. He loved pulling strings and playing with the press. The princes called him Blackadder.' The author, who has described herself as 'the most hated woman in Britain', defended her reasons for publishing the book which attacked Diana. 'The enduring memory that everyone had of Diana was the Panorama interview when she sat looking very forlorn and talked about the three of them in the marriage,' she told the programme. 'I thought he's never going to defend himself. Was he actually a villain who destroyed this beautiful young girl or was he a victim of a failed marriage of a mismatch. I wanted to know what the actual truth was.' After the book was published to coincide with Charles' 50th birthday, the Prince of Wales sought to distance himself and Camilla from the claims. Royal biographer Penny Junor, who has described herself as 'the most hated woman in Britain', defended her reasons for publishing the book which attacked Diana . The author said the enduring memory that everyone had of Diana was the infamous 1995 Panorama interview (pictured) A statement was released which said the book was not authorised, solicited or approved. 'That says what is wasn't, not what it was. I went to them and I said I want to write this book and I got help,' said Ms Junor. The BBC documentary became the subject of a row after it was claimed the Palace was delaying its broadcast by refusing to release archive footage. Clarence House has denied it was to blame for the programme being put back two months beyond its original scheduled time of December last year . Interviewees in the documentary, which was produced by Christopher Walker, said they believed Charles was unaware of some of his team's dealings with the media. Mr Bolland was not available for a comment when contacted. Clarence House declined to comment on the content of the documentary. The second part of Reinventing the Royals will be screened on Thursday, February 27 at 9pm. The explosive book prompted public outrage when it was released because it questioned Diana's sanity and suggested she was the first to be unfaithful, pictured the royal couple in  South Korea in  1992 . The documentary claimed William (pictured with his brother in 2008) was upset about a story about his first meeting with Camilla, now Duchess of Cornwall .","Prince William was 'upset' about leaked details from meeting with Camilla .

"Last October's explosion of Orbital ATK Inc's Antares rocket may have been triggered when debris inadvertently left in a fuel tank traveled into the booster's main engine, two people familiar with investigations into the accident told Reuters. The sources said the preliminary findings suggest that a simple assembly mistake by Orbital ATK could have caused the explosion, which destroyed a cargo ship bound for the International Space Station. Orbital initially linked the explosion to a problem with the turbo pump in one of the two Soviet-era NK-33 engines that power the rocket. GenCorp Inc's Aerojet Rocketdyne unit refurbishes the old motors and resells them as AJ-26 motors. Cameras recovered from the launch pad in Virginia shed new light on disaster (still image shown).The remotely operated cameras captured the explosion up-close in incredible detail. The Antares rocket was due to launch an unmanned Orbital-3 Cygnus spacecraft to deliver more than 5,000lbs of supplies to the International Space Station on 28 October. This included science experiments, experiment hardware, spare parts, and crew provisions - as part of a £1.2 billion ($1.9billion) deal with Nasa. Outfitted with a new, more powerful upper-stage engine, the Antares rocket was packed with 5,055 pounds (2,293 kg) of supplies, science experiments and equipment, a 15 percent increase over previous missions. But just seconds into the launch a turbopump in one of the engines failed, leading the rocket to experience the catastrophic failure. Orbital ATK on Friday acknowledged that so-called 'foreign object debris' was one of more than a half dozen credible causes of the explosion, but said it was not 'a leading candidate as the most probable cause of the failure.' Orbital spokesman Barry Beneski said the company-led 'accident investigation board,' which includes officials from NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration, had not identified any evidence of mishandling of the flight hardware by Orbital. He said Orbital continued to compare data from the October explosion with a May 2014 test stand failure of a different AJ-26 engine, and prior failures involving AJ-26 ground tests in 2009, 2011 and 2012. No details have been released on the May 2014 test stand incident, but sources familiar with the earlier investigation said it was likely linked to faulty 'workmanship' on the original motor, and additional inspections had been mandated to prevent mishaps with other engines. Orbital also successfully launched one Antares rocket in July 2014, after the May incident. NASA spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz said NASA was conducting its own internal 'lessons learned' review of the accident, but declined to give any details about individual aspects of the investigation. She agreed with Orbital that foreign object debris was always considered as a possible cause in aerospace accidents. If the investigations confirm that debris from the fuel tanks caused the Antares explosion, that could have significant financial and legal effects for Orbital ATK, which was formed by the merger of Orbital Sciences Corp and Alliant Techsystems. The new findings could also open the door for a legal claim against Orbital by GenCorp, which took a $17.5 million loss in October, after Orbital said the accident had prompted it to accelerate plans to switch to a different engine. One source said the Orbital investigation could end without declaring a single 'root cause' for the explosion. Probes of past accidents have had similar results. Officials have confirmed the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport launchpad in Virginia (shown after the explosion) could be repaired as soon as 2015. The Antares rocket exploded seconds after lift-off on 28 October, but in a statement it was revealed the pad escaped severe damage . Several sources said it may be difficult to determine conclusively whether the debris entered the engine before the explosion, or as a result of it. Glenn Mahone, spokesman for Aerojet Rocketdyne, declined to comment on the investigations, noting that they were still underway. He also declined to comment on the cause of the May test stand failure, which is part of the investigation. One of the sources familiar with the probe said investigators found particles of a crystallized desiccant, or drying agent, in the turbo pump and other parts of the AJ-26 engine. The crystals could have caused sparks and triggered a fire when they hit the turbo pump in the oxygen-rich environment, the source said. Desiccants are often used to control moisture in fuel tanks but need to be removed before takeoff, the sources said. Orbital Sciences have said a new version of Antares could launch as soon as 2016. This will be using new engines, which will be tested in a 'hot fire' next year. Just seconds into the launch a turbopump in one of the engines failed, leading the rocket to experience the catastrophic failure (shown) The explosion partially contaminated the region around the launchpad. But last week the Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority revealed it would take just a year to repair the damage. Repairs to the launch pad and its facilities are expected to cost between £8.3 million and £12.8 million ($13 million and $20 million) While the NASA investigation had not finalized the root cause of the accident, there were multiple signs that suggested some 'foreign object debris' had been ingested into the engine from the fuel tanks, one source said. Antares had four previous successful flights. The Oct. 28 explosion was the first accident since NASA began using commercial providers to fly cargo to the space station. Orbital already faces steep bills for damage to the launch site, and the need to buy a different rocket to launch its next cargo ship to the space station. In December, the company said it would buy a booster from United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, to meet its obligations under a $1.9 billion cargo supply contract with NASA. Orbital is one of two companies NASA hired to fly 40,000 pounds of cargo each to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011. Privately held Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, has the other contract, valued at $1.6 billion. Repairs to the launch pad and its facilities are expected to cost between £8.3 million and £12.8 million ($13 million and $20 million). And in a separate release, Orbital confirmed they would launch a new Antares rocket by the end of 2016. 'Under the new approach and in line with Orbital's existing CRS contract, all remaining cargo will be delivered to the International Space Station (ISS) by the end of 2016,' said the company. 'There will be no cost increase to Nasa and only minor adjustments will be needed to the cargo manifest in the near term.' Orbital also confirmed they will seek a new propulsion system upgrade for Antares, as it was believed the Russian engines used on the October launch were the reason for the failure. The company will perform a 'hot fire' test of the new engines next year to ensure they work as planned. The Nasa-funded rocket exploded on its way to the ISS (shown) just six seconds after lift-off from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island in Virginia .The rocket exploded at 6:22pm EDT on 28 October, and was carrying equipment that would have helped hunt for asteroids to mine . Organisations said more than £125 million ($200 million) worth of equipment was destroyed in the huge explosion (previous image shown). Orbital Sciences said it would stop using the type of Russian engines that were employed when its unmanned Antares commercial supply rocket exploded . They explained how in the first aerial surveys of the launch pad they could see their cameras, but they had to wait several weeks to get everything back from the Accident Investigation Board. One of the cameras was even located very close to the middle of the pad and right in the middle of the explosion. As dust and debris flies around, the camera somehow manages to survive. The rocket was carrying equipment that would have helped hunt for asteroids to mine and also a number of Earth-observation satellites. Organisations said more than £125 million ($200 million) worth of equipment was destroyed in the huge explosion.","The Antares rocket exploded seconds after lift-off on 28 October .

"Ask any pet owner and they will tell you that their furry, scaly or feathery friends make their lives better in many ways.  Now two animal lovers are sharing the love. Julie Edwards is a remedial therapist and yoga teacher in Perth who runs special 4 Paws Yoga classes for pets and their owners. 'I began treating dogs in 2008 and I’m qualified as a therapist for small animals,' Julie told Daily Mail Australia. Yoga instructor Julie Edwards runs yoga classes for dogs and their owners in Perth . Classes involve stretching, using equipment and lots of social time for the dogs . What started as teaching yoga to companion dogs quickly turned into something more, and now Julie runs bigger classes to help dogs bond with their owners and other dogs. 'The classes are run in backyards and people team up and they have doggy friends come over,' Julie said. 'All of the dogs work off lead and use equipment,' she added. With the aid of pool noodles to help the dogs stretch and other objects the classes run for about an hour, but admittedly include a lot of social time. 'We do a bit of a warm up with the dogs ... (and) the dogs work together as a group but also individually. Benefits include rehabilitation from injuries, helping the canines develop body awareness and prevent them from injuring themselves. 'Bonding and having fun – that is the key element, bonding,' Julie revealed. Julie has two dogs of her own - Rosie and Snoopy who are both beagles and said they love a bit of stretching and posing. Her cat however isn't as keen on the idea. 4 Paws Yoga classes not only help dogs bond with their owners but also with other canines . Pets can also indulge in a type of massage therapy, which can help animals with injuries, but also give them a chance to relax. Emma Kidd, also from Perth runs Bowen therapy for dogs, after discovering the technique when she injured herself a few years back. 'I was a vet nurse for many years; I've worked in the industry or about 10 years,' Emma told Daily Mail Australia. 'I injured myself and to seek alternative solutions for my shoulder injury and I discovered Bowen which was really beneficial. 'It’s not like (traditional) massage, it’s a soft tissue therapy, it helps with common muscular and skeletal problems.' Emma has treated all sorts of animals from companion pets and show dogs, to dressage and racing horses - and even camels. Emma Kidd said the strangest animal she's ever done Bowen therapy on was this camel . She does a lot of work with retired competition animals but also looks after smaller pets . She said the benefits include recovery, helping animals into retirement if they were competitive, or just as a relaxation technique. 'It's about well-being for the animals the same as we treat ourselves and get a massage,' Emma said. The Perth woman said she uses the techniques on her own pets, a horse called William, her two retired greyhounds Max and Roxy and her borzoi (a Russian wolf hound) Merlin. Emma Kidd who runs a clinic specialising in Bowen therapy for dogs is pictured here with her pets . New research shows pet owners are more likely to live happier and healthier lives alongside their furry friends . Now new research backs up their feelings, revealing that having a pet may have many benefits for their owner from helping them recover from a heart attack or reduce stress to getting them out and exercising. Those who spend time with their animal companions are likely to be repaid with a happier, healthier and longer life, and there is psychological evidence to confirm this released just in time for Love Your Pet Day on Friday. Australian universities, in partnership with the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition and Mars Petcare, have for decades conducted globally recognised research into the positive benefits of pet ownership. 'Pet owners often mention the care and affection they give their pets and the sense of wellbeing they receive from having pets in their lives, Dr Kersti Seksel, veterinary specialist at the Sydney Animal Behaviour Service said. 'It’s a mutually beneficial relationship that can help humans stay physically and emotionally healthy from childhood well into old age.'

"A 29-year-old man who allegedly walked into an Oregon elementary school and tried to kidnap a nine-year-old boy was stopped when the child's teachers realized what was going on and gave chase. Joshua Brown walked through the the front doors of Joseph Gale Elementary School in Forest Grove on Thursday afternoon as hundreds of children were filing out for the day, police said. He then reportedly strode into a classroom and picked up a third-grade boy, before attempting to walk out with him. However, two teachers, Sienna Garrett and Staci Heath, were in the room at the time. Ms Heath, who was the first one to spot Brown, immediately demanded that he put the boy down while the child exclaimed loudly that he did not know the man who was holding him, school officials said. Scroll down for video . Mug shot: Joshua Brown (pictured) allegedly walked into an Oregon elementary school and tried to kidnap a nine-year-old boy - but was stopped when the child's teachers noticed what was going on and gave chase . Praised: Teachers Staci Heath and Sienna Garrett (right) reportedly saw Brown pick up the young boy in their classroom and told him to put him down. Principal Gretchen Schlag (left) then chased Brown onto the streets . Brown then allegedly panicked and dropped the boy  on the ground, before fleeing from the school. But within seconds,  the school's principal, Gretchen Schlag, and other staff members had given chase. While Ms Heath and Ms Garrett apparently remained inside the school to ensure the nine-year-old boy and other students were safe, Ms Schlag and her colleagues followed Brown out of the gates. They reportedly called 911 as they pursed Brown into the surrounding neighborhood. Minutes later, the suspect was arrested by police - although Ms Schlag said the chase 'felt like it lasted forever.' Now, Brown is facing on multiple charges, including kidnapping and burglary, for his alleged actions at the school at 3130 18th Ave. He was already wanted on a felony warrant, OregonLive.com reported. During the incident, Brown is believed to have been able to enter the school's one unlocked exterior door while around 350 students and dozens of staff members were departing after the final bell. Although the young boy he picked up was naturally 'shy', he was 'very vocal' in alerting Ms Heath and Ms Garrett to the fact that he did not know the man who was holding him, Ms Schlag said. Scene: Brown, 29, walked through the the front doors of Joseph Gale Elementary School  in Forest Grove on Thursday as hundreds of children were filing out for the day, police said.

Principal: Although the  boy Brown allegedly picked up was naturally 'shy', he was 'very vocal' in alerting Ms Heath and Ms Garrett to the fact that he did not know the man who was holding him, Ms Schlag (above) said . 'He did a very nice job of saying ""I don't know this person. This is a stranger. I don't know who you are"",' she told Fox 12, adding that Brown was only in the school for around one minute in total. After Ms Heath ordered Brown to put the boy down, the suspect apparently told her the principal had asked him to evacuate the school. Ms Heath later told police Brown appeared high or drunk. On Friday, parents were praising Ms Schalg, Ms Heath and Ms Garrett, as well as the other staff members involved in tracking down Brown, for their efforts in ensuring the boy's welfare. 'I'm just glad they caught him. It definitely could have been a whole lot worse,' said one, John Verand.

Police have not yet established a motive, nor a connection between Brown and Joseph Gale, KPTV reported. There is not thought to be a connection between the suspect and the unidentified child. Ms Schlag said she will now be placing additional staff members near the school's main entrance in a bid to enhance students' safety. Staff patrolling the area will be given walkie-talkies, she said. It is the first time the school has experienced an incident of this kind, Ms Schlag added.","Joshua Brown walked into Joseph Gale Elementary School, it is claimed .

"City dwellers have noticed emboldened foxes for years. But now a new study claims that humans and the urban environments that they have created have affected the evolution of a whole host of species - triggering the growth of enormous spiders, the shrinking of fish  and the emergence of birds with no fear of man. And the changes are happening faster than previously thought which ‘may have significant implications for ecological and human well-being,’ according to one expert. A new study claims that animals living in cities have evolved rapidly because of human influence. For example, Pacific salmon (b) have become smaller, blackbirds (d) have changed their migratory behaviour, Crespis sancta (e) disperses less seeds in built-up areas, earthworms (f) have become tolerant to metal, while white-footed mice in New York are carrying more ticks, leading to increased cases of Lyme Disease in humans . Maria Alberti, of the University of Washington College of Built Environments, said that until recently, it was assumed that evolutionary change would take too long to affect ecological processes immediately. ‘We now have evidence that there is rapid evolution. These changes may affect the state of the environment now. This is what's called eco-evolutionary feedback,’ she said. Professor Alberti explained that the number and variety of animals living in cities has not simply decreased, but humans are causing them to evolve rapidly. She has reviewed evidence of ‘human signatures’ - or examples of changes in fish, birds, mammals and plants - caused by man in her study, which is published in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution. Professor Alberti explained that the number and variety of animals living in cities such as New York (stock picture) have not simply decreased, but humans are causing them to evolve rapidly . Experts from the University of Sydney, Australia discovered that golden orb weaver spiders (stock image is shown) living in urban areas of Sydney were larger and had more babies than their rural relatives, and that an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame . ‘Many species of mammals, birds, fishes, and insects have learned novel behaviours, such as diet, foraging skills, and anti-predator behaviour,’ the study says. For example, it cites research that found the bodies of fish changed in response to the construction of dams and that Pacific salmon have become smaller in urban areas. In contrast, a study published in August last year found that spiders are growing larger in cities than in rural environments. Experts from the University of Sydney, Australia discovered that golden orb weaver spiders living in urban areas of Sydney were larger and had more babies than their rural relatives, and that an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame. Professor Alberti said that changes in animals have an effect on ‘ecosystem functions such as biodiversity, nutrient cycling, seed dispersal, detoxification, food production and ultimately on human health and well-being.’ In addition to the growing spiders and shrinking salmon, she cited earthworms with increased tolerance to metals and seeds of some plants dispersing less effectively. This diagram shows how changing urban environments influence eco-evolutionary dynamics. Changes in animals happens through a series of subtle mechanisms including changes in habitat, biotic interactions,  disturbance and social dynamics . Some whitefooted mice in the New York were found to be a ‘critical host’ for black-legged ticks (pictured left) that carry the bacterium (shown right) that causes Lyme disease . A study published in August last year found that spiders are growing larger in cities than in rural environments. Experts from the University of Sydney, Australia, discovered that golden orb weaver spiders living in urban areas of Sydney were larger and had more babies than their rural relatives, and that an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame. 'Our findings show the impact urbanisation can have on local wildlife,' said said Elizabeth Lowe of the University of Sydney. 'While many species do not survive encroaching urbanisation and the consequent loss of native habitat, others have a more complex relationship with man-made changes to the landscape.' The researchers collected golden orb-weaving spiders (Nephila plumipes) from across the Sydney city region. 'We quantified the degree of urbanisation of 20 sites then looked at changes in the spiders' body size, fat reserves and ovary weight,' Ms Lowe said. The results show spiders in areas with more vegetation cover had smaller bodies and larger bodies when located in urbanised areas. The authors also found that the spiders' reproductive ability, measured by increased ovary weight, appeared to increase in urban areas. Earthworms have adapted genetically to a series of soil contaminates, including arsenic, and certain plants also have also developed an increased tolerance for heavy metals in brownfield sites in cities. The study mentions research that found the weed Crepis sancta disperses a significantly lower proportion of its seeds in urban patches than in undisturbed surroundings and that the seeds of Mycelis muralis are less able to disperse by wind in cities. Worryingly, the study also points to evidence of changes in a type of urban mouse, that may have health consequences for humans. Some white-footed mice in New York were found to be a ‘critical host’ for black-legged ticks that carry the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The 2013 study by researchers from the Universities of New York, Fordham and Connecticut Storrs, was the first to report changes to genes as the result of humans and urbanisation. Professor Alberti’s study says that thriving mouse populations allow more ticks to survive and lead to predictable spikes in human exposure to the illness. It also discusses how songbirds are becoming tamer and bolder, as well as changing their tunes to ensure their acoustic signals are not lost in the noisy urban background. For example, Great tits are among bird species that have changed the frequency of their notes to adapt to the noise present in urban environments. The shapes of songbirds’ wings has even evolved in response to forest fragmentation in North America, according to research by Laval University, Quebec and Cornell University in New York. Great tits are among bird species that have changed the frequency of their notes to adapt to the noise present in urban environments, while European blackbirds have become more sedentary . European blackbirds have been found to be becoming sedentary and have changed their migratory behaviour in response to urbanisation. Professor Alberti said that humans in cities cause the changes in a number of ways. For example, cities disrupt vegetation patterns, create toxic pollutants and increase the temperature, meaning that animals have to adapt rapidly to survive. Noise and light pollution can also drive change in animal behaviour, while the presence of humans changes the availability of resources such as food and water, altering the life cycle of many species. The study says: ‘Humans are major selective agents with potential for unprecedented evolutionary consequences for Earth’s ecosystems, especially as cities expand rapidly.’ While the research may seem bleak, Professor Alberti does not have a ‘catastrophic’ perspective but says her work highlights that humans have a unique opportunity to shape the evolution of the Earth. ‘We can drive urbanising ecosystems to collapse or we can consciously steer them toward a resilient and sustainable future,’ she said.","Professor at the University of Washington College of Built Environments analysed previous animal research focused on urban environments .
Cited shrinking salmon, changes in birds' songs and migratory habits, and worms' tolerance to metals, for example, as evolution driven by humans .

"A man has been arrested for his wife's murder nearly four decades after she was last seen. Marvin Gail Owens, now 62, is accused of killing his wife, 23-year-old Deborah Diane Owens, in Oroville, California in 1978 and then disposing of her body. Her remains have never been found. Police say Owens had long been suspected in the disappearance but authorities only recently managed to gather enough evidence to secure an arrest warrant. He was arrested in Nebraska on Wednesday and is awaiting extradition back to Butte County. Investigators are also looking at whether Owens was involved in the disappearance of another woman just nine months before his wife vanished. Arrested: Marvin Gail Owens, pictured left in his mugshot, is accused of killing his wife, 23-year-old Deborah Diane Owens, pictured right, in 1978 and then disposing of her body. He was arrested on Wednesday . His wife Deborah, a working mother-of-two, was last seen on November 19, 1978, at the family's home in Oroville and her husband reported her missing two days later. At the time, family members and friends dismissed suggestions she would get up and leave her children, while others said there had been problems in the marriage, the Chico Enterprise-Record reported. There were reportedly signs that a crime had taken place in the home but police were unable to gather enough evidence to charge anyone. Still, investigators pushed on. Butte County Sheriff Perry Reniff, who joined the case a year after the disappearance, continued working on it even after he retired and continues to lead the investigation. Last seen: Deborah was last seen at this home in Oroville, California where she lived with her husband and their two young daughters. Friends and family said she would never have left her children . Butte County sheriff's Sergeant Jason Hail told the Enterprise-Record that investigators had long suspected Owens was responsible for his wife's disappearance. 'Early on, [he] became the primary guy,' Hail said. 'Nothing else over the years has come up that would suggest anyone else was involved.' Connected? Essie Margarette Hiett vanished the same year and had mutual friends with the Owens . He would not specify exactly what led to the arrest this week, but said detectives discovered important evidence from the house, and had gathered new witness statements, including from the couple's now-adult daughters. 'This case has been building,' Hail said. 'Finally, there's enough evidence for the district attorney to feel comfortable filing the arrest warrant, though we haven't found her remains.' Police also told Action News Now that statements by Owens himself had also contributed to his arrest, but no further details were given. After her disappearance, Owens moved out of the county and eventually the state, and has been living in Ogallala, Nebraska. On Wednesday afternoon, Owens was arrested by Keith County sheriff's deputies in Ogallala, and he is now awaiting extradition back to Butte County. Investigators are also looking into any links with the February 1978 disappearance of Essie Margarette Hiett. Police would not say why they believe the cases could be connected but told Action News Now that the Owens and Hiett knew some of the same people. Hiett, then 48, left her job at a bar in the early hours of February 13, 1978, and headed home in her car, but the vehicle was found wrecked in a ditch with no one inside. She was not heard from again and her body has never been found.","Marvin Gail Owens was arrested in rural Nebraska on Wednesday, nearly four decades after his wife Deborah was last seen at their California home .

"It’s a decision that every seasoned traveller has wrestled with when a hotel doorman calls a taxi or a guide wraps up a tour – who should you tip during your travels and how generous should you be? While tipping is customary in most Western nations, many tourists are making big mistakes when it’s time to show their appreciation for good or exceptional service, largely because they don’t know how much to give and they are unaware of local customs. It can lead to awkward or uncomfortable situations, especially when the amount doesn’t reflect the quality of the service provided or no tip is given at all to someone who is expecting one or may be relying on gratuity to pay their bills. Tipping is not expected in China, but it has been catching on at businesses frequented by Western tourists . In a small number of countries, holidaymakers must tread carefully to avoid offending employees in the service industry. In Japan, for example, tipping is considered an insult. As for how much, it depends on the type of service provided, quality and geographic location as the rules vary by country. If the service is extremely poor, it’s OK to leave nothing at all. Etiquette expert William Hanson, author of The Bluffer’s Guide to Etiquette, said: ‘If the service or standards are sloppy then do not tip as the staff will only think that they are being rewarded and will get complacent and standards will not improve.’ Paul Fidgeon, associate professor of tourism at the University of West London’s School of Hospitality and Tourism, said tipping can be an ethical minefield, but the 10 per cent rule is a good one to follow. He said: ‘There are clearly issues here around who should you tip, how much should you tip, and should you tip at all, and there are big differences between countries and cultures. The standard tip for hotel bell staff is £1 to £5 per bag (or $1 to $5) when it is delivered to the room . ‘My advice here would be, in order to prevent problems, is do your research before you travel and try and find out about tipping culture and customs in that country prior to leaving home. ‘If in doubt, a small gratuity is taken a sign of appreciation.’ Oonagh Shiel, travel expert at Cheapflights.co.uk, added: ‘For those who are prepared to put a dent in their travel spend to cough up the cash needed for service charges, the rules surrounding tipping around the world are far from finite. ‘Whether you’re paying in euros, Indian rupees or US dollars the tipping system can come with a myriad of country-specific guidelines, leaving many tourists suitably perplexed.’ Despite the naysayers, it can lead to better service. Mr Hanson said he once over-tipped by about 100 per cent following an evening drink in the bar at a Washington, DC, hotel. He added: ‘Needless to say at breakfast the next day and for every breakfast there after I got incredible service and staff were falling over themselves to accommodate my every need. ‘I had fresh pastries “on the house” brought over, even though I didn’t want them, and everyone seemed to know my name suddenly.’ MailOnline Travel spoke to travel insiders to learn more about who should receive a tip – and how much – in countries where it is accepted. If a service charge isn't included, the standard tip at a restaurant is 10 to 15 per cent . Restaurant wait staff . These days, restaurants tend to include a service charge on the bill, and it is usually noted near the bottom. In the UK, the standard service charge is 12.5 per cent of the bill. If a service charge isn't included, the standard tip ranges from 10 to 15 per cent worldwide or up to 20 per cent for exceptional service in countries where it is common. Mr Hanson said: ‘The standard used to be 10 per cent - a nice easy percentage for people to work out but in the last ten years restaurants have sneakily pushed this up to 12.5 per cent, which is a pain for everyone concerned, but 10 per cent is still a good guide.’ The same rule of thumb typically applies for room service or a bartender. Marriott places envelopes in guest rooms at 1,000 of its hotels to encourage tipping for housekeeping staff . The American Hotel & Lodging Association published a gratuity guide which offers the following advice for guests: . Housekeeping staff: Leave a tip of $1 to $5 in a marked envelope or with a note. Concierge: Tip $5 to $10 depending on the service provided. Hotel shuttle driver: Give $1 to $2 or $4 to $5 per party. Valet/parking attendant: Hand over a tip of $1 to $5 when the car is delivered. Bell staff/porters: $1-$5 per bag, especially if the luggage is heavy or the staff member explains the room and its features. Door staff: Tip $1-$2 if they hail a cab. Delivery of special items (an extra blanket, for example): $2 for one item, $1 for more . Room service: If there is no service charge, tip 15 to 20 per cent. Restaurant: Leave a tip amounting to 15 per cent of the total bill or 20 per cent for exceptional service. Bartender: 15 to 20 per cent of the tab. Housekeeping staff . These hotel employees tend to be the forgotten ones because they tend to do their work when guests are not around. But some hotels are starting to remind their customers of the work that they do. Marriott places envelopes in guest rooms at nearly 1,000 of its hotels to encourage tipping for its cleaners. The American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) published a gratuity guide, which said guests should leave a tip of $1 to $5 in a marked envelope or with a note. Housekeeping staff in better hotels should expect £5 to £10 at the end of a week’s stay, said Mr Hanson. Concierge . Tips for concierges depend on the nature of the service provided. Did they book a table at a trendy restaurant? A few pounds or dollars should do. If they managed to score hard-to-get tickets to a concert or sporting event, a tip of at least $10 (approximately $6.50) is warranted, the AHLA said. Another option is leaving a lump sum upon departure. It is not uncommon to tip hotel door staff £1 to £2 for hailing a cab, and £1 to £5 per bag for bell staff . Porters and door staff . The standard tip for hotel bell staff is £1 to £5 per bag ($1 to $5 or the equivalent in local currency) when it is delivered to the room. It should be on the higher end of the scale if the bags are heavy or if the employee takes time to show you how to operate the TV or explain the room’s features. Guests who request bell service when they check out should provide another tip. It is not uncommon to tip door staff £1 to £2 for hailing a cab. Taxi drivers are usually tipped 10 per cent of the fare, although in some countries it is common to round up . Transportation . For valet service, tip £1 to £5 (or $1 to $5) to the employee when the car is delivered. Those who are driven to and from their hotel by shuttle should give £1 to £2 or £4 to £5 per party. Taxi drivers are usually tipped 10 per cent of the fare, although in some countries it is common to simply round up to the nearest whole number. In Africa, holidaymakers should budget a tip of at least $10 per day (in a shared vehicle) for game rangers . Tour guides . This is another situation where the 10 per cent rule tends to apply. Experts said the standard tip for a tour guide is 10 to 20 per cent for a job well done on a day tour. For multi-day group tours, about £5 a day in local currency should be enough. Before travelling abroad holidaymakers should take some time to research local tipping customs to avoid an embarrassing situation. Saskia Welman of Holidaylettings.co.uk said: ‘If you haven’t managed to research acceptable tipping advice for your destination, keep an eye out on what other tourists around you are tipping. ‘Never ask whether you should tip someone or not as this can be embarrassing for the service person or you could end up being ripped off.’ Here are a few customs to take note of: . Tipping is considered an insult in Japan . Africa: Ten to 15 per cent is the norm at restaurants, but the bill may include a service charge. For game rangers, holidaymakers should budget a tip of $10 per day (approximately £6.50) in a shared vehicle, or at least double that amount if they are travelling in a private vehicle, said Oonagh Shiel, travel expert at Cheapflights.co.uk. Australia: There is no tipping culture in Australia or New Zealand, so it is not a requirement. For those who receive exemplary service, a small tip is a good way to show appreciation, said Ms Shiel. Caribbean: Many all-inclusive resorts discourage tipping as it is typically included in the cost of the room. Guests who are unsure should check with the concierge to find out if tips are permitted. China: Tipping is not required or expected, but it is common at hotels and restaurants frequented by Western tourists. High-end hotels or restaurants may add a service charge to the bill. Tipping is very common in Hong Kong and Macau. Egypt: Expect to pay a further five to ten per cent on top of the five to ten per cent service charge. France: ‘Service compris’ means that a service charge is included on the bill, but customers can leave extra if they were satisfied with the service. Germany: Don't leave a tip on the table at a restaurant. Hand it to the waiter or waitress. Japan: Tipping is considered an insult in Japan, so don’t bother offering a little extra to your cab driver or waiter. Spain: A tip of between seven and 13 per cent is commonplace in restaurants, according to the level of service received, though travellers are unlikely to get a rap on the wrist if no tip is given, said Ms Shiel. Thailand: Tipping is not a requirement, but 20 baht is acceptable in many situations.","Many tourists don't know how much to tip or are unaware of local customs .

"TV presenter Dan Snow has lost a battle to tear down an orangery in the grounds of his £7million country mansion and build an office in its place . As an award-winning TV historian, Dan Snow has championed Britain’s rich architectural heritage. But when it came to a building project of his own, officials found very little at all to admire. TV presenter Dan Snow has lost a battle to tear down an orangery in the grounds of his £7million country mansion and build a two-storey office in its place. The Battlefield Britain presenter and his heiress wife Lady Edwina Grosvenor submitted plans  so they could work from their 18th century home  in the New Forest. Snow, 36, and Lady Edwina, 33 – who as daughter of Britain’s richest landowner, the Duke of Westminster, stands to inherit some of his £8.5billion fortune – wanted a detached office so they could keep work and family life with their two young children separate. But members of the New Forest National Park Authority rejected the application after complaining about the size and saying it looked like something 'you would find on an industrial estate'. The couple bought the four-bedroom house in Exbury, Hampshire, from convicted mercenary  Simon Mann for a reported  £10million in 2009. Father-of-two Mr Snow wanted to demolish a 1970s-built neoclassical-style orangery in the garden and replace it with an ultra-modern eco-friendly building. Clad in timber and corrugated metal to give it an ‘agricultural feel’, the 3,000sq ft building would have enough space to store boats and room for the pair to hold meetings with the charities they support. The TV presenter would also have hosted tutorials for university students as well as allowing the local community to use it occasionally. He told the NPA's planning and development control committee it would replace an 'appalling building that is effectively derelict'. 'It would not be seen from the road and would only be seen in snatches from the river,' he said. A report that formed part of the couple's planning application said: 'Both have high-profile jobs and are in public and media demand. No go: Mr Snow wanted to demolish a 1970s-built neoclassical-style orangery in the garden and replace it with an ultra-modern eco-friendly building . Too big: The New Forest National Park Authority rejected the application after complaining about the size and saying it looked like something 'you would find on an industrial estate' 'This necessitates a great deal of travelling and with two very young children they would like to be able to work from home as much as possible but enjoy a degree of separation from the main house in order to enjoy a better worklife balance. 'Dan also works with university students and would like to be able to utilise the facility from time to time for tutorials and training. 'Both Dan and Edwina are patrons of many charities and have periodic meetings which they would like to be able to hold at their home as opposed to travelling to London.' But NPA members criticised the scale and design of the proposed development. The couple bought the four-bedroom house in Exbury, Hampshire, from convicted mercenary Simon Mann for a reported £10million in 2009 . Members of the New Forest National Park Authority rejected the application after complaining about the size of the proposed building and saying it looked like something 'you would find on an industrial estate' Cllr David Harrison said: 'I completely understand why the applicants have put forward this proposal but it looks like something you would find on an industrial estate. 'We have a duty to approve schemes that enhance rather than detract - and I'm of the view that this detracts.' The committee's reasons for refusal were: 'The proposed home office/studio, by virtue of its scale, size, form, appearance and intended use, could not be considered incidental or appropriate to the main and secondary dwellings at the site or the curtilage. 'It would also facilitate the creation of a separate dwelling for which only a minimal amount of internal alteration would subsequently be required. 'As such it would be contrary to the requirements the New Forest National Park Core Strategy and Development.' The couple now have the option to appeal the decision. The application was supported by the chairman of Exbury and Lepe Parish Council, Peter Hayward-Broomfield. He said: 'The applicants are busy people with diverse careers. They need a suitable working environment that's separate from home and domestic distractions. 'It will have little visual impact or any other impact on the local community.' Mr Snow and his wife Lady Edwina Grosvenor, daughter of the Duke of Westminster, were hoping to use the office space so they could work from home . An aerial view of the 18th century home in the New Forest which is thought to be worth around £7million . Wendy Perring, from design firm Pad Studio, said the New Forest National Park Authority was mainly concerned about the office being used for residential purposes. Mr Snow, whose father's cousin is Channel 4 News present Jon Snow, 67, graduated with first class honours in Modern History from the University of Oxford before beginning his presenting career. He has presented many history programmes for the BBC and other broadcasters and has a regular history slot on The One Show. Battlefield Britain, which aired in 2004, won a BAFTA Craft Award for special effects. The same year Snow won a Sony award as one of the presenters on the LBC Boat Race . Lady Edwina's father is Britain's richest landowner, Gerald Grosvenor, 63, and she is set to inherit a slice of his £8.5billion fortune. The spectacular property was formally owned by mercenary and former British Army officer Simon Mann, 62. Mann was jailed for 34 years in Equatorial Guinea for his role in a failed Government coup in 2004. He received a presidential pardon on humanitarian grounds on 2 November 2009. Mr Snow was not available for a comment when contacted.

"EastEnders viewers frustrated with last night's dramatic twist have complained to Ofcom, claiming the mystery of Lucy Beale's death was too difficult to solve themselves. Ofcom received five complaints in total, with four people bemoaning being given 'false information' which 'misled'  them when trying to work out who killed the character last year. More than 11 million people tuned in to see Bobby Beale, the character's 11-year-old half-brother, unmasked as her murderer in a highly publicised live-episode. Scroll down for video . EastEnders viewers complained that 11-year-old Bobby Beale (played by Elliot Carrington, above) had been identified as the killer, claiming they could not have predicted the outcome themselves . But audience members complained the development was too out of the blue, claiming the BBC provided viewers with false information about the killer's identity. Another viewer said the soap should have included a helpline after making references to murder and drugs throughout the much anticipated semi-live episode. 'Ofcom has received five complaints about last night’s episode of EastEnders, on BBC 1. 'We will assess these complaints before deciding whether to investigate or not,' a spokesman said. Almost 12million people tuned in to BBC last night to learn who had killed tragic Lucy Beale on Good Friday last year. When Bobby was revealed to be her killer in a shock twist, more than one million tweets were posted about the show. Millions are expected to watch tonight's episode in which details of how the murder was covered up for so long are explored. Viewers also complained that no helpline was advertised at the end of the show to help those affected by drug abuse or violence. Lucy Beale (played by Hettie Bywater, above), had a drug problem . In 1997, 22 million viewers watched Bianca Jackson and Ricky Butcher (played by Patsy Palmer and Sid Owen) get married in a special episode of the show . While  last night's ratings were three times the number of an ordinary mid-week episode they pale into comparison with others in the show's 30 year history. In 1997, 22 million people tuned in to watch the wedding of Bianca Jackson and Ricky Butcher, while 30 million saw 'Dirty' Den Watts hand a divorce letter on Christmas day in 1986. When Phil Mitchell's shooter was revealed in 2001, 19million people watched the show. The drop in ratings is a result of an increase in the number of television channels available today, experts said. 'No other medium is as popular as TV, has the power to attract millions of people together at the same time and makes such an impact on our culture,' said Lindsey Clay, chief executive of Thinkbox, the marketing body for commercial TV in the UK. 'TV has always done this, but 30 years ago people could only choose from a handful of channels; now they have hundreds - and the flexibility to watch whenever and wherever they like. 'This huge choice has meant that the TV audience is more spread out than it used to be because people can seek out shows they are specifically interested in - foodies have food channels, sports fans have sports channels, arts fans have arts channels and so on.

"A speeding driver who crashed into a hired car taking expectant parents to a New York City hospital has been convicted in the deaths of the couple and their baby, who was delivered alive after the wreck but didn't survive. Julio Acevedo was found guilty Thursday of two counts of second-degree manslaughter and one count of criminally negligent homicide. The latter charge was related to the baby's death. Acevedo could face up to life in prison when he is sentenced on March 18. Scroll down for video . Julio Acevedo (left) 46, faces life in prison after being convicted in the deaths of 21-year-olds Nachman and Raizel Glauber (right) Nachman and Raizel Glaubers, who were 7 months pregnant at the time of the crash, were heading to the hospital in this Toyota Camry cab when they were killed . Prosecutors estimated Acevedo was going 70 mph — more than twice the legal speed limit — when he smashed into a livery car in March 2013. Nachman and Raizy Glauber, both 21, died that day. Their son, Tanchem, delivered by cesarean section, died a day later. The deaths left the couple's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn grief-stricken and touched off an intense manhunt for the 44-year-old suspect, who served time in the 1990s for a shooting conviction. Good Samaritans who stopped to help the victims told investigators that Acevedo assured them he wasn't hurt; prosecutors said he slipped away on foot, fully aware of the carnage. He surrendered in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, after five days on the run. Acevedo's family described him as a dedicated family man who quit his job to become a stay-at-home father. 'A beautiful innocent family lost their lives because Julio Acevedo chose to drive in a reckless manner,' District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said in a statement. 'Almost two years later we were able to get justice,' said Thompson, who went to the courtroom to hear the verdict.

"A new once-daily hormone treatment has boosted the sex lives of older women. Using VagiCap increased by a third the number of women getting sexual satisfaction, say findings from a trial. The treatment, which is not yet available, is aimed at women who experience pain during sex and other symptoms caused by the menopause. More than half of post-menopausal women suffer vaginal dryness that can make sex uncomfortable because of a lack of the hormone oestrogen. A new gel claims to be able to boost a woman's sex life after the menopause - by relieving the pain and discomfort associated with a  lack of oestrogen . The new treatment is a tear-shaped softgel capsule designed for easy insertion once a day, alleviating local symptoms. However, the oestrogen has less effect throughout the body than hormone replacement therapy (HRT) which should lessen any side effects. Dr Sheryl Kingsberg, chief of the Division of Behavioral Medicine Department at UH Case Medical Center in Cleveland, presented the trial at the International Society of Women's Sexual Health Annual Meeting, in Austin, Texas. Dr Kingsberg said: ‘Menopause is typically associated with hot flashes (flushes), but there are other common and distressing symptoms such as pain and discomfort during sex due to lack of oestrogen. ‘Approximately 30 million women in the United States experience this condition, which can really impact their quality of life.’ She said the VagiCap, if approved by regulatory authorities, could be a treatment that women ‘may find to be convenient and easy to use’. At least half of menopausal women experience uncomfortable, often distressing symptoms such as dryness -making sex painful . In the UK, the average age of the menopause is 51 years, when periods stop and oestrogen hormone levels decline. Research earlier this week found at least half of menopausal women experienced uncomfortable, often distressing symptoms for more than seven years on average and often much longer. The latest study involved women between the ages of 40-75 who were assigned to use the VagiCap once daily – usually at the same time in the morning – or a placebo (dummy) treatment. A qualitative survey by the researchers found that 63 per cent of women on the VagiCap reported an improvement in quality of life after only two weeks of therapy treatment, compared to 48 per cent on the placebo. Dr Kingsberg said: ‘For many women, symptoms such as these have a major impact on frequency and spontaneity of their sexual activity. ‘It is essential that health care attendants routinely engage in open and sensitive discussions with postmenopausal women to ensure that symptomatic atrophy is detected early and appropriately managed.’ New treatment options have the potential to improve satisfaction for these women, she said. ‘There is medical consensus that oestrogen administered locally is the preferred mode of treatment for both symptom reduction and restoring and maintaining healthy vaginal tissue and sexual function’ she added. TherapeuticsM, manufacturers of the VagiCap, began a phase three trial in September 2014 which is investigating 4 mcg, 10 mcg and 25 mcg doses of oestrogen as different options to meet women's treatment needs.","VagiCap is a tear-shaped capsule designed to be inserted into the vagina .

"Shamed HSBC bosses are under pressure to hand back their multi-million pound payouts as Britain’s high street banks prepare to award bonuses worth a total of more than £5bn. Stuart Gulliver, the HSBC chief executive, is in line for pay and perks of £7.4m, including a bonus of £1.3m. The disgraced bank, which has been under fire for a string of scandals including tax avoidance at its Swiss private banking arm, is preparing to reward its top staff with a total bonus pool of £2.2bn. Documents alleged that the Swiss arm helped wealthy clients to cheat the taxman by hiding their assets. Stuart Gulliver (pictured), the HSBC chief executive, is in line for pay and perks of £7.4m, including a bonus of £1.3m . The payout to Mr Gulliver is below last year’s £8m but will spark outrage coming in the wake of the Swiss tax scandal. Dame Colette Bowe, chairman of the Banking Standards Review Council which has been set up to improve the behaviour of leading lenders, said: ‘Those leading our banking businesses need to think very carefully about the patterns of behaviours they are seeking to reward.’ The revelations come as the banking giant will next week report profits of nearly £15bn – or a staggering £40m a day. Mr Gulliver has worked at HSBC since 1980, working his way up the ranks. He has sat on the HSBC group management board since 2004, including the period when the Swiss private banking scandal was at its peak, between 2005-2007, and became chief executive in 2011. He will be questioned by Parliament's Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday along with chairman Douglas Flint, who is paid around £2.4m a year. Mr Flint will be quizzed over his role as finance director at the time when the bank was found to be helping customers avoid taxes through its Swiss unit. HSBC, which has been under fire for a string of scandals including tax avoidance at its Swiss private banking arm, is preparing to reward its top staff with a total bonus pool of £2.2bn . Levels of excess at the UK’s scandal ridden lenders has reached such a pitch that even bosses organisation the Institute of Directors, which represents executives at companies across Britain, is urging banks to show ‘restraint as we approach the general election and with so much anti-business mood music in the country at the moment’. Simon Walker, director general of the IoD, said: ‘As the banks announce pay and bonus deals for 2014, I would urge them to show restraint. Now is the time to restore the link between long-term performance and financial reward for senior bankers. This has been broken for a number of years, but never has the political imperative of doing something about it been greater.’ The lavish payouts at HSBC, which owns the former Midland bank in the UK, are expected to be announced alongside the bank’s annual results on Monday. Rival high street lenders will reveal their profit figures in the following days. Taxpayer-owned Royal Bank of Scotland is preparing a bonus pot of around £500m while Lloyds Banking Group will announce total payouts of around £375m. RBS’s chief executive Ross McEwan (pictured) will receive £1m salary and a £1m allowance but does not receive a bonus from the tax-payer controlled bank . Its chief executive Antonio Horta Osorio is in line for a package of £7m, including the release of long-term share incentives from 2012 that come to fruit this year. Barclays will unveil its results the following week and is lining up bonuses of just under £2bn for its bankers, only slightly below the £2.4bn it paid last year. Liberal Democrat MP John Thurso, who sits on the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and will be questioning HSBC’s chiefs, said: ‘I don’t think chief executives should be paid a bonus at all. The bonus system is fundamentally flawed and must be re-thought. ‘Why do people deserve this much money when brain surgeons and army chiefs earn less and do far more?’ Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury Select Committee, added: ‘Chief executives should give up their bonuses. 'There is no other industry that has so much ongoing criminality as bankers, from Libor and forex to the Swiss tax scandal. The idea that there should be any bonuses paid is extraordinary.’ In order to receive his performance-linked bonuses, Mr Gulliver has to meet standards of ethical behaviour set by the pay committee. He received an annual incentive last year of £1.83m after the committee ruled he had shown ‘leadership in promoting HSBC Values,’ including acting with ‘courageous integrity.’ The bank says on its website: ‘At HSBC we put great emphasis on our values. We want to ensure that our employees feel empowered to do the right thing and to act with courageous integrity. By doing so we will meet the expectations of society, customers, regulators and investors.’ The comments are at odds with the revelations emerging about its behaviour at its Swiss arm and with previous scandals including a £1.2bn fine for money laundering in Mexico and sanctions-busting in the Middle East. American lawmakers have warned that HSBC is in danger of further sanctions that could include losing its banking licence in the US over the Swiss allegations. Across Britain’s other major banks, Barclays chief executive Anthony Jenkins could be in line for £1m bonus for 2014 while tax-payer backed Lloyds is expected to release long-term share awards that will total £7m. RBS’s chief executive Ross McEwan will receive £1m salary and a £1m allowance but does not receive a bonus from the tax-payer controlled bank. Taxpayer-owned Royal Bank of Scotland is preparing a bonus pot of around £500m . News of the size of the bonuses come at a particularly sensitive time ahead of polling day in May and follows another year of scandal for the banking industry which has been embroiled in a series of embarrassments from the mis-selling of payment protection insurance to the rigging of foreign exchange markets. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘While the real value of wages has fallen every year since the crash, top bankers continue to rake it in. It is one rule for those at the top, and another for everyone else. ‘And when HSBC has come under such widespread criticism for its role in tax evasion and avoidance, bank customers will not understand huge bonuses especially when branches are being closed.’ David Hillman, Robin Hood Tax Campaign spokesman, said: ‘It's shocking that the chief executives of HSBC, Barclays and Lloyds are taking home more than a million pounds each in bonuses while their industry remains mired in scandal. ‘You might have thought the recent revelations of misdemeanours would prompt restraint, but the opposite is true - total remuneration packages for the three of them look set to exceed a staggering £5 million each. ‘It's high time the Government ensured banks contribute to society instead of lining their own pockets.’ Deborah Hargreaves, founding director of think tank High Pay Centre, said: ‘It is insensitive to be paying out such huge bonuses when we read about endless scandal when people are not enjoying pay rises themselves. There is a general feeling that banks haven’t been putting their houses in order.’","HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver is in line for pay and perks of £7.4m .

"The family of a two-year-old diagnosed with a rare brain tumour say they have been forced to beg for their daughter's life – after she was refused NHS funding for treatment. John Paul Bevan and his wife Katherine say the Welsh NHS is denying their daughter a 'chance at life' by refusing to fund proton beam therapy. The desperate couple say the pioneering treatment is the best chance that their daughter Freya has at beating her rare but deadly, primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET). They now need to raise £250,000 to fund the treatment – which is only available abroad - as they believe it is less invasive than radiotherapy, which can have devastating side effects. The family of two-year-old Freya Bevan, who has been diagnosed with a rare brain tumour, say they have lost their dignity in begging for their daughter's life . Mr and Mrs Bevan want to take Freya to the U.S. for proton beam therapy, but have been turned down for funding from the Welsh NHS. Mrs Bevan said: 'The Welsh NHS haven't given her a chance of life. It's absolutely disgusting' Proton beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision. It is not available in the UK, but the NHS sometimes offers funding for some patients to go abroad if their care team thinks they are ideally suited to receive proton beam therapy. Mr and Mrs Bevan - who have both work for the NHS - fear they may have to follow in the footsteps of the parents of Ashya King who rejected NHS advice and took their own children abroad for the treatment when the NHS refused to fund it. Mrs Bevan said: 'The Welsh NHS haven't given her a chance of life. 'It's absolutely disgusting. We've both worked for the NHS for a long time, but now we want something back, but they can't help us. 'They have made us lose our dignity and beg for our daughter's life.' Freya was diagnosed with the tumour in May last year and has since fought through numerous operations and sessions of chemotherapy - coming back from death more than once. Mr and Mrs Bevan, who live in Neath, South Wales, want to take her for specialist proton beam therapy in America to save her life. The family has already raised £80,000 to pay for accommodation across the pond, after receiving support from the Welsh rugby team and ex-Arsenal star and cancer survivor John Harston. They applied to the Welsh Health Specialist Services Committee but were turned down. Now they need to raise a further £170,000 to cover the cost of the treatment - and they face a race against time as the tumour could grow at any moment. Freya was diagnosed with the tumour in May last year and has since fought through numerous operations and sessions of chemotherapy. The family need to raise £250,000 for the proton beam therapy treatment, and have so far raised £80,000 . If they can't raise enough money for treatment, Freya will have to have radiotherapy — which has a high chance of leaving her unable to live an independent life. Mr Bevan highlighted the case of Ashya King's family, and said: 'Ninety per cent of me wishes we had done what they did.' Ashya's family removed him from Southampton Hospital, taking him to Europe last year, for the pioneering treatment, which was later paid for by the NHS. The family had raised similar concerns about radiotherapy. A Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee spokeswoman said proton beam therapy is only commissioned on a very limited basis, and clinical guidelines define which cancers the therapy is an effective treatment for. Swansea City are set to wear special wristbands to raise awareness of Freya's plight when they take on Manchester United tomorrow. To help raise funds for Freya, visit her Go Fund Me page. Proton beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision. The radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy X-rays, used in conventional radiotherapy. Unlike an X-ray, the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body. It enables therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely. Proton beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision. It is not available on the NHS, but sometimes the health service funds patients going abroad for the treatment . The beam can be more finely controlled, in both its width and its depth, so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours, with less risk to healthy tissues. The therapy is not available in the UK, though the NHS will fund sending patients abroad if their care team thinks they are ideally suited to receive proton beam therapy. Around 400 patients – mostly children – have been abroad since 2008. The NHS choices website says: ‘Some overseas clinics providing proton beam therapy heavily market their services to parents who are understandably desperate to get treatment for their children. ‘Proton beam therapy can be very costly and it is not clear whether all children treated privately abroad are treated appropriately. ‘It is important not to lose sight of the fact that conventional radiotherapy is, in most cases, both safe and effective with a low risk of complications.’ Source: Mayo Clinic and NHS Choices .","Freya Bevan, two, was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour in May 2014 .

"The undertaker who handles the bodies of the executed on Indonesia's 'Death Island' has shared what the final moments are like for families before their loved ones are shot and shed light on what Myuran Sukuraman and Andrew Chan could be eating as their last meal. Suhendro Putro, 62, has been a funeral director since 1992 and cleaned the bodies of the last group of convicted drug smugglers who were put to death in January. He told Daily Mail Australia families and undertakers were placed together in an open area, which was paved with bitumen about 1km away from where the prisoners were executed. Suhendro Putro, the undertaker prepares the coffins for the bodies of the executed on Indonesia's 'Death Island' Putro said the families are close enough to hear the screams of the executed . Mr Putro said five officers on the execution squad shot at the same time as they killed each inmate. 'Five people shot at the same time so the sound was so loud. There was just one bang and one of them had a real bullet,' he said. 'The family started crying and screaming when this happened. It was just a shock to me.' It is unclear whether or not the families of Myuran Sukuraman and Andrew Chan would be on Nusakambangan - in Central Java in Indonesia - when the Bali Nine duo meet their fate. Australian Michael Chan (L), the brother of death-row prisoner Andrew Chan, arrives with family members at Kerobokan Prison. It in unclear if they will be present for the execution . Raji Sukumaran and Brintha Sukumaran, the mother and sister of Myuran Sukumaran, leave the Denpasar Penitentiary . Indonesian Authorities have announced the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran has been delayed by up to one month . Mr Putro said fellow inmates would cook the final meals of those on death row. He said the last time he was on the island for January's round of executions he, his team and officers on duty were fed Nasi Padang - a rice dish native to West Sumatra in Indonesia. Meanwhile, family members gathered at the jail ate KFC for dinner before the executions took place just after midnight on January 18. Then Mr Putro would wait a hour and a half to two hours for the medical examiner to remove the bullets before cleaning the bodies. He then dressed the Christian men in white formal suits with gloves, the Muslim men in traditional funeral dress or whatever the family had requested of him.

"A New York couple have been evicted from their rent-stabilized Manhattan penthouse after they advertised it on Airbnb for triple their $6,670-a-month rent. Henry Ikezi, 35, his wife and child must move out of their two-bedroom apartment by February 28, or they will be forced out by a city marshal. The decision comes under a Manhattan Housing Court judge's ruling earlier this week - the first to evict a tenant under the city's rent control code. The court case is likely to send shivers through tens of thousands of New Yorkers who make extra cash by listing their rent-stabilized apartments on Airbnb and similar housing share sites. Henry Ikezi (above), 35, had listed his discounted $6,670 a month Hell's Kitchen penthouse on Airbnb for $649 a night. A Manhattan Housing Court judge ruled that tenants who live in rent-stabilized apartments cannot get a financial break, and then pocket money from tourists after listing their apartments online . Ikezi, his wife and child are expected to move out of their two-bedroom penthouse (above) located in the 450 W. 42nd Street apartments by February 28, or they will be forced out by a city marshal . The penthouse was rent stabilized, so Ikezi was paying two-thirds of the $9,000-plus market price . By law, a guest can stay temporarily as long as the permanent resident is living there for the duration of the stay. Ikezi said this was the case for him and his family while tourists shared the space with them . Ikezi's Hell's Kitchen penthouse located at 450 W 42nd Street is rent stabilized, so Ikezi was paying two-thirds of the $9,000-plus market price, according to the New York Post. On Airbnb, Ikezi listed the corner unit for $649 a night, equaling $18,172 a month - nearly triple what he pays in rent, according to court documents. The two-bedroom and two-bathroom penthouse offered guests access to the building's amenities such as: a private fitness club by Equinox, a heated indoor lap pool, full-size indoor basketball and volleyball courts, terraces, outdoor and indoor screening rooms, an internet cafe and a Dog City pet spa. The presiding judge, Justice Jack Stoller, claimed that Ikezi was benefiting from marked-down rent because the building's developers had taken a tax exemption to offer some apartments at rent-stabilized prices. Rent-stabilized apartments can only increase in price year-to-year by a small amount, which is set by the city. Stoller ruled that as a result, Ikezi cannot sublet the penthouse triple the price of what he pays in rent to his landlord. By law, a guest can stay temporarily as long as the permanent resident is living there for the duration of the stay. Ikezi, who flips homes for a living according to the ruling, said this was the case for him and his family while tourists shared the space with them. On the ad's listing, he wrote: 'I maintain an area in the unit at all times in accordance with state and city laws'. However his landlord, Related companies, dismissed the claim as sources have said that Ikezi uses the penthouse as a way to pocket extra cash while he resides in a million-plus dollar home in Jamaica, Queens. Ikezi told the presiding judge, Justice Stoller, that he could not remember whether he had  ever charged guests to stay in the apartment. Sources have said that Ikezi uses the penthouse as a way to pocket extra cash while he resides in a million-plus dollar home in Jamaica, Queens . When confronted about his Airbnb listing that said the apartment featured 'skyline views', Ikezi said it could be a neighbor's listing with similar decor . Justice Stoller claimed that Ikezi was benefiting from marked-down rent and cannot sublet the penthouse for triple of what he pays in rent to the landlord . Todd Nahins, the landlord's lawyer, said his client is cracking down and will not tolerate tenants using their apartments as hotels . And when he was questioned about his Airbnb ad that said the penthouse featured 'skyline views' and was located in the  'most happening neighborhood in Manhattan' - he shrugged off the claim, suggesting it could be a neighbor's listing with similar decor. But Related's lawyer, Todd Nahins, said neighbors complained about strangers who were coming in and out of the apartment. He also said his client is cracking down and will not tolerate tenants using their apartments as hotels. In Stoller's 12-page ruling, he said: 'Using a residential apartment as a hotel room and profiteering off of it is ground for eviction...as it undermines a purpose of the Rent Stabilization Code.' The judge's verdict exhibits that nearly all New York city residents are putting themselves at risk of eviction when they list their homes on home rental sites because they are violating the terms of their leases, according to New York state Senator Liz Krueger. Airbnb, which makes a reported $40million from New York listings, is the real culprit she added, because it is not doing enough to set limits. 'We advise all hosts to review their local rules before they share their space, and we believe we need smart limits on home sharing in rent-regulated apartments,' said Airbnb spokesman Nick Papas.

"A father who had a tumour  weighing almost a stone on his face is having the last of the growth removed - ten years after it started growing. Stefan Zoleik,  from Martin, Slovakia, became a social recluse as the fatty lump grew from ear to ear. Doctors were unable to operate because of health complications. But in June last year the 47-year-old underwent a five-hour removal procedure. Scroll down for video . Stefan Zoleik, 47, is having corrective surgery in Martin, Slovakia, after a 13lb tumour grew on his neck. He is pictured last year . Medics are now hoping additional surgery will get rid of all the affected cells. The former plumber suffers from a rare condition called Madelung disease, which causes tumours to grow. The problems started in his early 20s when he noticed he was developing a large jaw. He said: 'Since the surgery last year my life has changed incredibly. I don't know why it wasn't possible for it to be done earlier but I'm just grateful that it has been done now.' Mr Zoleik pictured shortly after a successful operation that removed the massive tumor from his neck . The father-of-two had an initial operation in June last year. He is pictured from his hospital bed after the surgery . Madelung disease is a rare condition that causes tumours to grow around the neck, shoulders and upper arms. It usually affects men between the ages of 30 and 70. It can lead to a loss of neck mobility and pain. The growths can also become cancerous in rare circumstances. Their exact cause is unknown. One benefit of the operation is that it stopped people staring at him in the street. Mr Zoleik, a husband and father-of-two, said: 'I'll finally be able to go for a beer with friends without people turning their heads and pointing at me. 'My family were really surprised how well I looked when they came to visit me in the hospital after the operation. 'Over everything else it was my family who helped me the most. They supported me both before and after the surgery, and are my rock that also gave me the strength to recover.' The retired plumber said: 'I'll finally be able to go for a beer with friends without people turning their heads and pointing at me'. Pictured as a young man before the condition took hold . Mr Zoleik's family said although they were used to his appearance, they were happy he had managed to gain a face that he wanted to show the public. Igor Homola, a plastic surgeon from the Martin University Hospital, said that despite the initial operation changing Mr Zoleik's life they still have to do the corrective surgery. He said: 'Even after surgery there will be cells that have kept on growing and we now need to operate to remove those  to fix it.'","Stefan Zoleik suffers from Madelung disease, which causes fatty lumps .

"You like wearable technologies, and you like bananas, but which is better? Now, you don’t have to choose, as a company has found a way to combine the two. Dubbed ‘the world’s first edible wearable’, Dole Japan has unveiled their rather odd smart banana with built-in LEDs and sensors. Designed for marathon runners, the device can apparently track your running time and even advises you when to eat the fruit. Scroll down for video . Dole Japan has revealed their bizarre Wearable Banana (shown). The tech-laden fruit has an LED screen on its peel. This can tell you your heart rate, race time and display messages. It can then be strapped to your body - like other wearable technologies. And the banana can also be eaten after you finish the race . The device appears to be a bone fide product, and not a hoax - two runners among 30,000 will are set to ‘wear’ the banana at the Tokyo Marathon on 22 February. Dole has sponsored the race since 2008, handing out bananas to runners as they make their way around, but now plans to bring their sponsorship into the 21st century. ‘The power source is a small battery connected to the wearable banana,’ said Dole Japan spokesperson Hiromi Otaki, according toCnet. It’s a common problem: You sit down for dinner and your jeans fit perfectly, but the more you eat the tighter they get. At the moment you have to manually undo the zip to feel comfortable, but in the future your zip may be able to adjust automatically. A researcher from MIT has created the Zipperbot that uses sensors to open and close the teeth in response to movement - such as an expanding waistline. ‘Inside the battery there are ultracompact LEDs and other electronic components. ‘These are the only details about the specs that we can tell you at the moment.’ The banana displays information on its peel using the LEDs, including your heart rate, race time and a message saying ‘eat me’ when it’s time to eat. It can then be strapped to your body and used during a race. It’s not clear if the technology alters the taste of the banana, or what you are supposed to do with the peel after you finish eating. ‘After you cross the finish line, of course, you can eat it too,’ a narrator says in a video for Dole revealing the wearable banana. ‘The world’s first edible wearable debuts at Tokyo Marathon 2015,’ the video concludes. ‘The power source is a small battery connected to the wearable banana,’ said Dole Japan spokesperson Itaru Kunieda, according to Cnet. ‘Inside the battery there are ultracompact LEDs and other electronic components.

"Soldier Robert Spence will face trial accused of racism after taking part in Trooping the Colour . A serving soldier who denies calling a black man 'monkey boy' at a Chelsea match will stand trial accused of racism after taking part in Trooping the Colour. Robert Spence, 31, is alleged to have directed the insult towards a man at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea's 2-0 pre-season win against Spanish side Real Sociedad last August. Spence, who is based at Wellington Barracks in London, denied one count of racially-aggravated threatening, abusive words or behaviour at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court today. The barracks is 300 yards from the palace and is home to the Foot Guards Battalions - the regular infantry regiments of the Household Division. Spence was allegedly identified as participating in chanting, telling the victim to look up the song on YouTube and asking him if he was from Africa. The soldier, who has served overseas, attended the match with his girlfriend, a Colombian fine art student, who will give evidence in his defence at his trial. The initial trial date of June 2 had to be scrapped because Spence will be preparing for Trooping the Colour. The annual military event takes place on June 13 and marks the Queen's official birthday. Spence was bailed unconditionally to return for trial on June 30. Spence, who has served overseas, is based at Wellington Barracks near Buckingham Palace .

"From Balenciaga to Chanel, Kim Kardashian has a wardrobe to boot, with designers bending over backwards to dress the star in their creations. While she has the most esteemed designers on speed dial and finally won plaudits in the fashion world - even landing a Vogue cover - one of fashion's most famous faces has revealed that wasn't always the case. Esteemed Givenchy designer, Riccardo Tisci, has revealed that he got 'killed' for dressing Kim before the style tide started to turn. Scroll down for video . Givenchy's Riccardo Tisci, who is now a close friend of Kim Kardashian's, has revealed what it was like styling her when no one else would . Riccardo, who has long been a good friend of Kanye, told Details that while Kim is a 'sweet girl', she was accepted by 'nobody' in the fickle fashion industry. He explains that he worked with Kim as a favour to his good friend Kanye - and helped reinvent her. 'Kanye and me, we did it together,' he said. 'Every designer is dying to dress her now. I didn't care what people thought about Kim. 'In the beginning, I met her because of my respect for Kanye, and then I liked her a lot and we became friends. I got killed because of this. But I didn't care.' Riccardo said that while Kim is a 'sweet girl', she was accepted by 'nobody' in the fashion industry at first . Givenchy pleated plunging black gown . Shop the designer at Barney's... Visit site . She recently took the plunge and chopped off her trademark flowing raven locks, and it appears as though Kim Kardashian adopted the same notion for this sartorial offering whilst out in NYC. Putting her voluptuous curves on display in a pleated black Givenchy gown with a neckline that left very little to the imagination, Kim managed to keep her class intact with the inclusion of a chic silk black blazer completing the all-black ensemble. Proving she needs no help in regards to her pert chest area, Kim embodied the ‘if you’ve got it, flaunt it’ mantra in the floor-grazing chiffon creation, and despite not being as confident as the reality star, we wouldn’t mind a slice of her style. There's nothing wrong with keeping a classic black gown in the wardrobe as a safe bet!

Riccardo went on to dress Kim and Kanye for their wedding and has decked her out in his garments plenty of times ever since. Riccardo is right; Kim's metamorphosis has been no mean feat, for while she might now be a firm  favourite with designers, her initial foray into the fashion world was much more humble - as a stylist for  Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan. In fact, pre-fame, Kim also worked as a personal shopper and she would regularly be dispatched to pick out new outfits for the the heiress and film star. Despite her skills as a stylist, her own style left much to be desired. From bright gold dresses to garish satin, she rarely made a 'best-dressed' list in the early part of her career. Even as she started to make a name for herself, for a long time, Kim was shunned by the designers who now adore her. 'Kanye and me, we did it together,' he said of Kim's reinvention. 'Every designer is dying to dress her now. I didn't care what people thought about Kim' Riccardo dressed a pregnant Kim for the Costume Institute Gala in May 2013 . Just over two years ago, during a photoshoot for ELLE magazine at the end of 2012, many designers refused to lend their clothes to the reality star. Nicola Formichetti, artistic director at Diesel, styled the shoot and revealed at the time that calling in high-end samples was a 'challenge.' He said: 'People wouldn’t lend me the clothes. But that’s fashion snobbery.' Nicola, who is now good friends with Kim, revealed that the top designers didn't want their designs featured on a woman who had, 'less-than-model-like-proportions'' However, he rightfully predicted at the time, 'She's not the It Girl yet, but she will be.' It truly seems Formichetti's prediction has come true... Kim has become the ultimate fashion IT girl. So close has the designer become to the global stars, that he designed the couple's wedding outfits . The 34-year-old made sure to credit her favourite outfit - and designer - of the year recently by posting a snap on Twitter with the caption: 'This Givenchy look could possibly be my favorite look of 2014' Kim has spoken on many an occasion about the rapper and designer's influence over her wardrobe choices. Left, pictured at the GQ Men Of The Year awards in a daring custom-designed haute couture gunmetal skirt by Ralph & Russo, with an Atsuko Kudo latex bodysuit with Tom Ford heels, and, right, at Paris Fashion Week in Balmain, both in September . Her fashion highlights to date include being asked by Carine Roitfeld, the former editor of French Vogue, to cover her CR Fashion book. Kim was photographed for the cover picture by Chanel's Karl Lagerfeld and the shoot was art directed by Ricardo Tisci. It was a controversial choice at the time, but that worked in Kim's favour, as Carine later explained to Time Out. She said: 'She’s controversial, but so was Marilyn Monroe and I always like controversial people.' She went on to praise the reality star, saying: 'She was brave...with Karl Lagerfeld shooting. 'She had one guy for hair, one guy for make-up – no extensions or lashes – and for her it must have been like being naked, and she accepted everything. 'I don’t think normally she would wear those sort of clothes – I’ve never seen her in a Comme des Garcons jumpsuit or a basketball jacket, but she said yes to everything. 'She was the easiest model we’ve had. And when we put a mask on her face, she didn’t say anything.' Kim Kardashian, wearing a Lanvin blazer, and rapper Kanye West attend the Lanvin show as part of the Paris Fashion Week - one of many of the shows at which the power couple sat in the front row . Before she found global fame, Kim worked as Paris Hilton's stylist and personal shopper . It was following North's birth in 2013 that it became clear just how popular Kim was becoming with the world's biggest fashion houses though, from the flood of designers that sent clothes for her new arrival, all duly documented on Kim's Instagram page. From Givenchy to Celine and Maison Martin Margiela to Alexander Wang, Kim shared photographs of North's adorable new wardrobe, signaling to the world that the fashion supremos were finally beginning to accept her. The biggest coup came in April 2014 though, when she and Kanye landed a joint Vogue cover ahead of their May wedding. The news caused outrage among some of the magazine's subscribers, but the edition went on to be one of the biggest sellers of the year. That magazine sold 500,000 copies, beating both Beyonce and Michelle Obama's Vogue covers. Not her best: Kim was never known for her fashion choices and her previous wardrobe contained a number of garish outfits like the gold cocktail dress she wore at the Spike TV awards in 2008, left, and, right, in 2010 at the Lorraine Schwartz jewellery launch .","Riccardo Tisci says he was 'killed' for dressing Kim but he 'didn't care'

"A homeless man who spent five hours dangling upside down after getting stuck in a window has been cleared of burglary after a court heard he had 'just been trying to find somewhere to sleep.' Carl Attar scaled two fences and shimmied up a drainpipe to reach the window 10ft above the ground of a university building. But the 27-year-old homeless man got his legs caught and he was left suspended upside down by his ankles in freezing conditions. Scroll down for video . Carl Attar, left, was found not guilty of burglary at Nottingham Magistrates' Court after he claimed he got stuck in a window at Nottingham Trent University, right, because he was looking for somewhere to sleep . Two passing students rang the Fire Brigade to rescue Mr Attar after they heard his panicked screams . He was found by two students who initially thought he was playing a prank, but dialled 999 when they realised he was stuck. Mr Attar was arrested and charged with attempting to break into the Nottingham Trent University building on January 22. He was found not guilty of burglary after Nottingham Magistrates' Court heard he was simply trying to find shelter warm for the night. Chair of the bench, Keith Taylor, said: 'We are not satisfied that you entered the building with intent to steal.' The court heard Daniel Dei Niet and fellow student Tom Burdett were passing the university's Arkwright building at 3am when they heard Mr Attar's cries. They took photos of the man and made a video before realising the seriousness of the issue and deciding to phone emergency services. A fireman eased Mr Attar through the window after his five hour ordeal at Nottingham Trent University . In a 34-second video, which has since received more than 70,000 views on the internet, the students can be heard asking Mr Attar if there was any way they could help. He was freed by firefighters and spent two days at Queen's Medical Centre before being charged with burglary with intent to steal. Magistrates heard Mr Attar had nowhere to stay on the night and after taking amphetamines, found himself in Nottingham city centre. Doctors told Mr Attar that they would have needed to amputate his leg if he spent a further 30 minutes suspended upside down from the window . Mr Attar said he saw the open sash window and decided to climb inside to find somewhere to sleep, but his plan went wrong when he became wedged. Now the drug addict has vowed to 'change his ways' after medics told him he could have lost his legs if he had been suspended any longer. Mr Attar, of no fixed address, said: 'Something trapped me in there. 'I don't know what it was. My legs just got caught and after a while I lost the circulation in my legs. I thought I was going to die. 'I had been there so long, my legs had pins and needles and my shins felt like they had been cut badly. 'Then I saw this guy and he asked me what I was doing up there. I said 'It doesn't matter what I'm doing, please help me'. 'I wasn't bothered about the students laughing, I just wanted to get down. Doctors told me another half an hour and I would have to have my legs amputated. 'I'm not a burglar. I was just trapped. It's like a lesson being taught. I'm changing my ways.' The court heard Mr Attar had 40 convictions for 69 previous offences, mainly shop thefts, and that he had been served with an anti-social behaviour notice, having previously been found on University of Nottingham premises. Ian Carter, defending, said: 'He was a homeless drug addict loner who had nowhere else to go. The question is, did he intend to steal? 'No. What he intended to do was find somewhere warm to go to sleep. He had no gloves and no means of carrying any items.' During the trial, Mr Attar said he had not bothered looking for a hostel because he was not registered. But a spokesman for homelessness charity Framework said: 'Help is available for people who find themselves in this situation. Tom Burdett, left, who is studying History, said he initially thought Mr Attar, top right, was a drunk student . 'We will make every effort to find them accommodation in such cold weather. 'For this reason we would urge anyone who is about to sleep rough to contact our street outreach team by calling our rough sleepers' hotline on 0800 066 5356.' Tom Burdett, 19, who is a first year student studying History, said: 'We initially thought it was a drunk student, because we've got friends who would probably end up doing something like that. 'But when we heard he was 27 I thought it might be a bit more sinister and he must have been trying to burgle the place. 'But I didn't know he was homeless, so I guess that makes a lot of sense. 'If you were in that situation you would just be desperate to find somewhere warm to sleep - it just went spectacularly badly for this bloke..' Daniel Dei Niet, 20, a Property investment and Finance student, added: We had been walking home from a night out when we literally stumbled across the guy. 'All I could see was the lower half of the person's legs poking out through the open part. 'I called out 'are you OK?' The man's voice was crying: 'I've been here five hours, help!' ' 'He was crying out shouting 'Let me go' and I dialled 999 and told the operator what had happened. 'Two fire engines and three police cars arrived and they had to cut the guy out of the window. 'The police took him away in handcuffs and we carried on home.'","Carl Attar was stuck hanging upside down from a window for five hours .

"Time Warner Cable has become synonymous with less-than-stellar customer service - and changing a subscriber’s name to a sexist slur is not likely to improve the company’s public image. Esperanza Martinez, from Orange County, California, was surprised to receive a note from the cable provider Monday trying to convince her not to cancel her service - a request she did not make in the first place. But she was even more surprised to discover that the missive pleading with her to stay with Time Warner was addressed to 'C*** Martinez.' Scroll down for video . Not playing nice: Esperanza Martinez, of California, has received a letter from Time Warner Cable addressed to 'C*** Martinez' asking her not to cancel her service . The offensive sexual profanity was also included in the introduction, 'Dear C*** Martinez.' Without a hint of irony, the note then went on to say that Time Warner 'has been working on improvements to deliver better experience every day.' Ms Martinez told the technology blog Ars Technica that she never asked to disconnect her service and was not sure why the letter was sent to her house. When she finally got on the phone with Time Warner, she learned that the name change was made on February 12 - the same day she had a live chat with a customer service representative about a problem with her cable box. But Ms Martinez insisted that she was no rude during the online conversation with the Time Warner staffer. ‘I was not upset even when they could not resolve my issue and had to send a technician out,’ she told the blog. ‘I have no idea why a TWC employee would do this and risk losing their job.' Time Warner has admitted to the mishap, claiming that an employee at a third-party vendor has replaced Ms Martinez's first name with the profanity in the cable provider’s computer system. Officials at TWC stated that the company has since severed ties with the vendor in question, and they are now reviewing their procedures to make sure this does not happen again. Comcast, Time Warner's future owner, sent Mary Baeur a bill earlier this month addressed to 'Super B---- Bauer' after she fought with the cable company to get the Hallmark Channel back in her package . Lisa and Ricardo Brown were shocked to receive this bill addressed to 'A**hole Brown' after they tried to cancel their cable from Comcast . Ms Martinez on Thursday received an apology from Time Warner, along with a free year of Internet and cable service. The embarrassing incident comes at a particularly inopportune time for Time Warner, which is currently in the process of merging with Comcast - the same cable company that made headlines over the past two months for lashing out at their customers. Less than two week ago, a Comcast subscriber in Illinois got a letter from the cable provider, in which her name was changed from ‘Mary’ to 'Super B**** Bauer' after the woman fought to have the Hallmark Channel added back to her package. In late January, Lisa and Ricardo Brown received a bill from the cable giant that was addressed to 'A**hole Brown' after they had an unpleasant exchange with a customer service representative and decided to cancel their service. Bed reputation: A survery found last year that Time Warner and Comcast, which are in the process of merging, are the two most hated companies in the US . In 2005, one woman had a similar experience when a Comcast invoice addressed her as a 'b**** dog'. Other customers, who sent their relabeled bills to customer advocacy writer Christopher Elliot, said their names had been changed to 'dummy' and another to 'whore Julia'. Comcast announced in February 2014 that it will acquire Time Warner Cable for $45billion, raising serious concerns among government regulators and industry experts about the impact the merger might have on the companies' subscribers. The American Customer Satisfaction Index last year found that Time Warner and Comcast were the two most hated companies in the nation.","Esperanza Martinez, of California, got a letter from TWC addressed to 'C*** Martinez' asking her not to cancel her service .

"A small family business standing in the way of Tottenham Hotspur's £400million stadium redevelopment has lost its David versus Goliath court battle against the club. Archway Sheet Metal Works asked a judge to quash Communities Secretary Eric Pickles' decision to confirm a compulsory purchase order (CPO) on the grounds that it was 'unlawful and invalid'. But a judge ruled there was 'no legal flaw' in the decision-making process, meaning the football club can secure the last patch of land needed to start work on its new 56,000-seater stadium. A small family business standing in the way of Tottenham Hotspur's £400million stadium redevelopment has lost its David versus Goliath court battle . Archway Sheet Metal Works asked a judge to quash a ruling that they must sell up so Tottenham can build their new 56,000-plus seater stadium . Archway, which is owned by Tottenham fan Josif Josif, 46, was gutted by fire in a suspected arson attack, and Mr Josif says his firm has been subjected to bomb threats. The London Borough of Haringey made the compulsory purchase order in March 2012 and it was confirmed by the Communities Secretary in July 2014 following a public inquiry. The company argued that the CPO was invalid, but Mr Justice Dove, an Aston Villa fan, ruled there was 'no legal flaw' in the decision-making process, paving the way for building work on the 'world class' venue to go ahead. As well as challenging the legality of the CPO itself, Archway argued that proposed new changes to Tottenham project  are so substantial that they 'alter the viability case made at the inquiry' and further undermine the order. Christopher Lockhart-Mummery QC, for Archway, said in written submissions that the Premier League Club dismissed these as matters of 'minutiae' within 'a sea of detail' which was 'irrelevant'. However, the Tottenham documents did reveal discussions had taken place involving an updated design of Tottenham's stadium and increasing its capacity by 5,000. Archway, which is alongside White Hart Lane's North Stand, was served the compulsory purchase order in 2012 and it was confirmed in last year . Arson: Last November, a mystery fire gutted the Archway premises, which are owned by Tottenham fan Josif Josif . The firm describes itself as a 'wonderfully old-fashioned family business' producing metal items for the catering and hospitality industry . Other potential improvements included an increase in residential development, incorporating 900 units in five blocks, plus 60,000 square feet of commercial development space and a medical centre and a 30,000 square feet gym and fitness centre. But the judge rejected the argument and all other grounds of challenge involving complex planning law. The judge refused Archway permission to appeal but the firm can still ask Court of Appeal judges directly to consider their case. Last November, a mystery fire gutted the Archway premises, which is alongside White Hart Lane's North Stand. Mr Josif who runs the family business, said at the time of the fire: 'People were calling us and threatening us and we were receiving bomb threats and that started a few months ago, but we don't know if that's got anything to do with it.' The small family business also received bomb threats after their objection to Tottenham's new stadium . The firm describes itself as a 'wonderfully old-fashioned family business' producing metal items for the catering and hospitality industry. The owners have been in a dispute with Tottenham for the last decade over its redevelopment plans. Tottenham plan to build the new capacity stadium next to the existing White Hart Lane ground, where they have played since 1899, which holds just over 36,000. The club hopes that moving to a larger, state-of-the-art stadium with an increased capacity will help bring in more revenue, making it easier to compete with top European clubs. North London rivals Arsenal moved into their 60,272-capacity Emirates Stadium in 2006. Tottenham already has planning permission for the new stadium it hopes to open for the 2018/19 season, after Archway's move to challenge the decision in the High Court resulted in a revised construction programme. The club was said to be considering moving to a temporary home for a season during the construction period. Options mooted included Wembley and the Olympic Stadium, while reports of a move to stadium:mk in Milton Keynes were met unfavourably by many fans. A spokesman for Tottenham Hotspur said: 'While there is still therefore a possibility of a further appeal, the hope must be that this High Court decision will now allow us to progress what is widely recognised as the flagship development in the regeneration of Tottenham.'","Archway Sheet Metal Works loses court battle against Tottenham stadium .

"With a trusting gaze, silky ears and the fluffiest of coats, this little pup would melt the hardest of hearts. His owner, however, must have had no heart at all. She abandoned him, frightened and bewildered, in the ladies’ toilets at a motorway service station. Staff found him hours later cowering at the back of a cubicle, curled up in a ball and whimpering in fear. Cute: The miniature Shetland sheepdog was discovered in the ladies toilets at a service station in Sandbach, Cheshire. Vets will carry out tests to see if his sight can be restored . They soon realised the pup, thought to be a miniature Shetland sheepdog and about eight weeks old, was blind. And they believe his owner, hoping to cash in on the trend for tiny ‘designer’ dogs, realised this made him worthless and abandoned him. His cries had alerted a customer, who told staff that there was a strange noise in the toilets. ‘He had been left in a cubicle behind the bin,’ said Sue Evans, director of the Roadchef services at Sandbach in Cheshire.‘He was curled up and looked frightened.’ She said colleague Angela Lonsdale, who works in the WH Smith at the site, had found the pup. ‘She managed to coax him out and we cleaned him up and wrapped him in one of the dog blankets we have on sale. Abandoned: The dog, nicknamed Louie by customers, was found in the toilets at a service station in Sandbach, Cheshire . ‘He had these piercing blue eyes, but he wasn’t making direct eye contact, which was when we realised he was blind.’ The sad start in life for this puppy illustrates the lottery of buying a so-called designer dog. While his history may never be known, he is thought to be a miniature Shetland sheepdog – which not a recognised breed in this country and is seen as part of the celebrity-driven fashion for tiny ‘handbag’ dogs. These pets are often associated with health problems as they are frequently the product of unscrupulous backstreet ‘puppy farmers’. They can also be imported from abroad, and are sold online for £500 or more. According to the Kennel Club, one in five puppies bought through websites or social media die within six months. In the US, breeders have raised fears that puppies sold as miniature Shetland sheepdogs are prone to weak bones, water on the brain and blood sugar disorders. Sadly some will be abandoned by disappointed buyers. Standard Shetland sheepdogs are normally around 14in tall, though can be anywhere from 13in to 16in. Staff have examined CCTV footage of the entrance to the services but believe the woman who abandoned the puppy hid him from sight as she went to the toilets. There are no other clues to her identity. ‘All we can think is that she found out he was blind and decided to dump him,’ Mrs Evans said. ‘It was an awful thing to do.’ But despite his difficult start in life, the puppy has at least found a happy ending. After being rescued three weeks ago, he was adopted by the services’ maintenance manager Ian Schofield, who already has a terrier named Belle and couldn’t resist the pup. ‘Belle has been like a mother to him,’ Mrs Evans added. ‘She acts as his eyes and barks out instructions to him.’ And now staff have set up an online appeal to raise money to cover the pup’s veterinary bills – which include a consultation with a specialist to see whether his sight can be restored. Last night it had raised £540. Workers and customers have also been paying £1 each to vote for the puppy’s new name, with the total – currently around £120 – going towards cancer charities. The leading choice so far is Louie, after the loo where he was discovered. ‘The saving grace is that he was left where people would find him,’ Mrs Evans said.","Whimpers heard by a customer who alerted staff .

"Animal welfare staff are desperately trying to re-home 25 black cats found crammed into a pensioner's one-room flat. They were stunned to find the cats, which were all given names starting with the letter H, after being called to the property by the elderly man's relative after he had to move homes due to ill health. But despite knowing they were going to be collecting a few animals, the Cats Protection staff had no idea just how many jet black cats they would be collecting from the small, one-room flat in Haywards Heath, West Sussex. A group of the black cats look up at the camera after being found crammed inside a closet next to a hoover . Heidi (pictured) was one of the 25 black cats found, all of which were given names starting with the letter H . Aside from those too young to go to a new home, most of the black cats are now up for adoption. Pictured is Hedwig . The cats, thought to be aged from four weeks to six years old, were all unneutered and had been breeding uncontrollably. Staff at Cats Protection's National Cat Adoption Centre, in Haywards Heath, are now hoping to find homes for all the black cats. Centre manager Danielle Draper said that although all were in good health, many were very nervous of people. She said: 'Finding homes for all these cats is going to be a huge challenge and we desperately need to hear from people who may be able to offer one a home. 'None of the cats had been neutered and so, in just a few years, the number of cats in the home had grown enormously. 'Cats are prolific breeders and this case shows how easy it is for things to get out of hand.' One unneutered female can give birth to around 18 kittens every year and be responsible for up to 20,000 descendants within five years, as kittens can breed when they are four months old.

Despite the cramped conditions, the cats were all healthy and well-fed. Pictured is one of the cats, named Hula . Despite the cramped conditions, they are healthy cats, well-fed, with glossy coats and no signs of illness. She added: 'But with so many cats it seems that they were not properly socialised so they are very nervous of people. 'We're doing a lot of work with them to help bring them out of their shells and we're hoping that, in time, they will settle in well into new homes. 'We are bracing ourselves for a challenge - black cats are hard to find homes for anyway, as people often prefer different colours. 'And a nervous black cat is an even harder prospect to find a new home for. 'I really hope we can find some owners who can see past the nerves and spot the potential for these lovely cats to become family pets. 'They deserve to be in a nice new home so we're hoping they won't have to spend too long with us at the centre.' Black cats are seen as good luck charms in most of the world, including Scotland and Ireland, but in England they are seen as bad omens.

"David Cameron has backed Scottish shipbuilding with an £859million investment in the next generation of Royal Navy frigates to be built on the River Clyde. The Prime Minister said the money will be spent on developing the Type 26 warship and sustain 1,700 jobs across the country. The ship will replace Type 23s, with around 13 expected to be built by BAE Systems for service in the early 2020s. Prime Minister backed an £859million investment for Royal Navy frigates to be built on the Clyde in Scotland . The money will be spent on developing the Type 26 warship and sustain 1,700 jobs across the country. Pictured, an illustration of an exterior shot of the latest design for the Type 26 Global Combat Ship . Around 600 jobs will be safeguarded in Scotland, with other BAE Systems sites and supply chain firms also benefiting in areas including Derbyshire, West Yorkshire, Manchester, Cheshire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire and Hampshire. During a visit to the Govan shipyard in Glasgow, Mr Cameron said: 'This is a substantial investment in our shipbuilding industry, safeguarding the jobs of 600 workers in Scotland and many more across the UK. 'Investing in these warships will ensure we continue to keep our country safe, at home and abroad. 'As part of our long-term economic plan, we're not just building the most advanced modern warships in the world - we are building the careers of many young people with apprenticeships that will set them up for life.' Defence Secretary Michael Fallon added the announcement is a 'clear vote of confidence in British industry'. He added it forms part of the government's commitment to invest more than £160billion in equipment and equipment support over the next decade. He said: 'As a result, our military will have some of the most impressive and technologically-advanced capabilities in the world, from the aircraft carriers and the F-35 Lightning II fighter jets to the Type 45 destroyers, Scout armoured vehicles, the A400M and the Astute Class submarines.' Mr Cameron, pictured at the BAE Systems Govan shipyard in Glasgow today, said: 'Investing in these warships will ensure we continue to keep our country safe, at home and abroad' BAE Systems chief executive Ian King said: 'We have a long and proud heritage of delivering complex warships in the UK and today's announcement is a significant endorsement of the Government's commitment to sustain this important national capability. 'We are committed to working with the Government, the Ministry of Defence and our partners in the maritime supply chain to ensure the Royal Navy has the capability it needs to protect national interests, while ensuring the best value for money for UK taxpayers. 'Through the Type 26 programme, we are transforming the way we design and manufacture naval ships with innovative new technologies, leading-edge processes and modern infrastructure. 'New ways of working ensure we can continue to deliver the highest quality equipment at the lowest possible cost and compete effectively for future UK and international orders.' The first Type 26 is due to enter service as soon as possible after 2020 and will remain in service until 2060. The development contract is expected to support around 30 companies in the supply chain. Around 13 Type 26 warships are expected to be built by BAE Systems for service in the early 2020s . The deal will sustain 1,700 jobs across the country, including safeguarding the jobs of 600 Scottish workers . David Hulse, national officer of the GMB union, welcomed the 'very good news' as it secures the future of shipyards along the River Clyde. He said: 'This announcement is very good news in that it secures the future of the Clydeside shipyards and the skilled workforce and will enable the company to provide a substantial number of much-needed apprenticeships. 'The uncertain international climate calls into question the Tory plans for further cuts in defence spending in the next parliament. 'These will impact on the capacity of the Army, the Navy and the RAF at a time when the UK needs to be able to deal with all threats to national security. The skilled shipyard and defence workforce are as much on the front line as the forces in uniform. 'During the election campaign the electorate need to question Tory spending plans where the combined annual budget of non-protected departments would have to come down by a third in real terms. 'A cut of one third in defence spending is simply not on and these plans must be changed.' Prime Minister David Cameron (centre) during a visit to BAE Systems Govan shipyard in Glasgow, Scotland . Today's announcement marked the culmination of an argument that raged during the independence referendum over the future of shipbuilding in Scotland. The Clyde shipyards had been earmarked for the lucrative contract to build Type 26 frigates, but the decision would be confirmed after the vote in September. Former First Minister Alex Salmond reassured Yes voters that shipbuilding would continue on the Clyde if Scotland became independent. But the No campaign - supported by the UK government, Ministry of Defence, Royal Navy and BAE (who all said that it would not and could not) - argued the contract would be lost if Scotland left the UK. Asked to guarantee the long-term future of shipbuilding, Mr Salmond told the Scottish Trades Union Congress: 'The Royal Navy will continue to order ships from Scottish yards, based on that these are the best places to produce these vessels.' But his remarks in April last year coincided with a speech by then UK Defence Secretary Philip Hammond in Glasgow - who warned that thousands of jobs would be at risk if Scotland became independent. Ian King, chief executive of BAE, also indicated, in a letter submitted to the chairman of the Scottish Affairs Committee Ian Davidson, that shipyards on the Clyde would likely have to close if Scotland voted for independence. Mr Davidson agreed, along with the shipbuilding industry and the MoD, that 'the only guarantee for the future of shipbuilding on the Clyde is for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom.' This is because companies based in an independent Scottish state would no longer be eligible for contracts that the UK chose to place or compete domestically for national security reasons due to Article 346 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union. The UK has not had a complex warship built outside of the country since the Second World War. But Mr Salmond and then Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon drew criticism from the industry and trade unions for continuing to suggest Britain's new warships would be built in Scotland if the nationalist campaign was successful as Ministry of Defence sources insisted it would not happen. The No campaign argued the lucrative shipbuilding contract would be lost if Scotland left the UK, but former First Minister Alex Salmond (right) reassured Yes voters that shipbuilding would continue on the Clyde . Henry Wilson, Unite staff convener at BAE Systems, said unions knew that UK defence contracts would not be awarded to a foreign country. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also argued Scotland would find it 'difficult' to win UK government shipbuilding contracts if the country votes for independence. The SNP accused him of trying to blackmail Scots into voting No. Nationalists claimed the Clyde was the only place left to build warships following BAE's decision to end shipbuilding in Portsmouth. Nicola Sturgeon dismissed suggestions that a Yes vote would put future warship orders in doubt, claiming that the Clyde would be the 'best and only place' to build the ships. In November 2013, she said: 'The current UK government has just agreed with BAE Systems that Portsmouth will cease building ships in 2014, and that Glasgow is 'the most effective location for the manufacture of the future Type 26 ships'. That will remain true, whether there is a 'Yes' next year or not.'","Prime Minister said money will be spent on developing the Type 26 warship .

"Greek Deputy Prime Minister Giannis Dragassakis . Greece could run out of money by the end of the month after Germany rejected a ‘Trojan horse’ bid for breathing space on its massive debts. Berlin threw out a proposal from the new far-Left government in Athens for a six-month extension on its eurozone loan agreement. Greece’s Deputy Prime Minister Giannis Dragassakis said: ‘It appears that there are powers that would like Greece on its knees, exactly so they can impose their will.’ Last night there were growing signs of an unprecedented split between Brussels and Berlin over the crisis triggered by the victory of the anti-austerity party Syriza in Greece’s general election. Minutes before it was torpedoed by Berlin, the European Commission had called the Greek request ‘positive’. Athens finally requested a six-month extension to its eurozone loan agreement, offering major concessions as it was confronted with the prospect of bankruptcy. But a document setting out Germany’s position, seen by the Reuters news agency, said the Greek proposal was ‘totally unclear how the Greek government wants to pay its bills over the coming weeks with the current shortfall in tax receipts’. Greece’s request ‘rather represents a Trojan horse, intending to get bridge financing and in substance putting an end to the current programme’. Athens requested a six-month extension to its eurozone loan agreement, offering major concessions as it was confronted with the prospect of bankruptcy.

Darwin's suburbs in the aftermath of Cyclone Tracy, Australia's most infamous storm, in late December 1974 . A police officer guarding against looters in the aftermath of Cyclone Tracy . Tropical cyclones are categorised from one to five based on the wind speed, with category five winds surpassing 280km/h. Category five storms – such as Cyclone Marcia – are classed as extremely dangerous and cause widespread destruction. Cyclones produce gale-force winds, torrential rain and storm surges that can cause extensive damage and lead to flooding, landslides and dangerous sea conditions. Geoscience expert Jonathan Nott said Cyclone Marcia was more intense than Cyclone Lam, which hit the Northern Territory overnight. The \damaged offices of Darwin's newspaper. Cyclone Tracy devastated the city on Christmas morning 1974 . Aircraft boarding steps lie in ruins on the tarmac at Darwin airport in the aftermath of Cyclone Tracy . 'It has basically stronger winds and as a consequence of that will be generating stronger onshore winds onto the coast, which means it will generate a bigger storm surge,' said Prof Nott, from James Cook University. How cyclones are named varies among meteorological organisations and countries. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology created a list with 104 names before the 2008-09 cyclone season. There were three lists before then. In the 19th century an Australian forecaster, Clement Wragge, used the names of South Sea Island girls, and then later used the names of the wives of politicians he disliked. When an especially destructive cyclone affects Australia, its name is retired. 'This one's also going towards major urban centres and the onshore winds and the storm surge could start impacting on Yeppoon where there are lots of beachfront properties. 'We are approaching a very high tide in the next hour or two, and the peak for the very high tide will coincide with very strong onshore winds at Yeppoon.' Prof Nott said he Premier Palaszczuk was 'absolutely right' to say the storms will be 'terrifying'. 'The wind is extremely strong, enough to knock trees out of the ground and break tree branches off,' he said. 'Then they because missiles, their impact on dwellings can punch holes in walls and start to cause structural breakdown of house. That's going to be the problem.' Damaged boats are stacked at Port Hinchinbrook, North Queensland in 2011, as a result of Cyclone Yasi . A street in Cardwell after it was hit by Tropical Cyclone Yasi - a category five storm - in January 2011 . Tropical cyclones are intense low-pressure systems that form when the sea-surface temperature is above 26.5C, drawing their energy from warm tropical waters. They can last for days but usually dissipate when they move over land or cooler water. Severe tropical cyclone Tracy is probably the most infamous of Australia's cyclones. At least 66 people died when Tracy, a category four storm, struck Darwin early on Christmas Day, 1974, virtually flattening the city with winds near the eye estimated at 260km/h. Workers from the Queensland Government's QBuild clear up debris at a home in Tully Heads in 2011 . Despite its intensity and incredible destructive power, Tracy was tiny. The World Meteorological Organization recognises Tracy as the world's smallest tropical cyclone, with gale force winds extending only 50km/h from its eye. Cyclone Yasi, which struck the far north Queensland coast in February 2011, is one of the largest cyclones to hit Australia in recent years. It was a category five storm, the most intense on the Australian cyclone scale, with a peak wind gust of 285km/h.

Prof Nott said Marcia had the same intensity as Cyclone Yasi, which devastated Queensland in 2011, but it was smaller in diameter. 'It won't impact along as great a length of coast,' he said. Cyclone Larry landed the tropical north Queensland coast near Innisfail as a category four storm in March 2006. The cyclone causes severe damage worth more than $500 million to infrastructure and crops, and damaged 10,000 homes. No lives were lost and no serious injuries were reported.

"The Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers are threatening to leave their hometowns and share stadium outside Los Angeles  if both teams fail to get new stadium deals. The division rivals announced their $1.7billion plan in a joint statement Thursday night, adding another layer of complexity to a possible NFL return to the region. The plan creates the odd prospect of the teams suddenly sharing a home field, and of Los Angeles having two NFL teams after going two decades with none. The Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Raiders both played their last games in the city in 1994 - then moved to St. Louis and Oakland, respectively. The Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers are planning a $1.7billion shared stadium in the Los Angeles area if both fail to get new stadium deals in their current hometowns, teams said in a statement. (file photo) And it takes the muddled issue of the NFL's return to Southern California and makes it downright messy, with at least three viable stadium plans in the works. St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke is part of a joint venture to build an 80,000-seat stadium at the site of the former Hollywood Park horse track just 10 miles from Carson in Inglewood. And a plan remains alive for an NFL facility in downtown Los Angeles. That stadium known as Farmers Field, until recently the leading candidate for the NFL's return to the area, now becomes a long shot with multiple competitors and no clear team attached. The proposed shared stadium for the Chargers and Raiders would be in Carson, 15 miles south of downtown LA and home to the Los Angeles Galaxy soccer team. The site of the proposed stadium - Carson Marketplace - is part of an old municipal landfill that the NFL has looked into buying at least three times, according to LA Times. The teams' statement says both have tried and failed for years to find stadium solutions in Oakland and San Diego, and without new agreements in those cities their hands will be forced. An artist's depiction provided by MANICA Architecture, is shown of the proposed football stadium on property in Carson, California, 15 miles south of downtown Los Angeles . The site of the proposed stadium - Carson Marketplace - is part of an old municipal landfill that the NFL has looked into buying at least three times . 'We are pursuing this stadium option in Carson for one straightforward reason,' the statement says. 'If we cannot find a permanent solution in our home markets, we have no alternative but to preserve other options to guarantee the future economic viability of our franchises.' Earlier this month, the NFL sent a memo warning teams that the league itself will be behind any decision to move to Southern California, and established a committee of owners to review the options. The Chargers and Raiders statement says they will respect and adhere to the guidelines the league laid out. Both teams said they plan to work in good faith through 2015 to find new agreements to stay in their current homes. The Chargers' talks with San Diego City Hall to replace the nearly 50-year-old Qualcomm Stadium have grown increasingly contentious. Earlier this month, the NFL sent a memo warning teams that the league itself will be behind any decision to move to Southern California, and established a committee of owners to review the options . If plans to move continue, all NFL teams looking into stadiums in Los Angeles are targeting 2016 for relocation. The only two NFL teams to share a stadium currently are the Jets and the Giants, who play in East Rutherford, New Jersey . Mayor Kevin Faulconer appointed an advisory group earlier this month to recommend a site and financing plan for a new stadium that can go on the November 2016 ballot. But Chargers' attorney Mark Fabiani told the group that there may not be a publicly acceptable solution to the problem and warned them against using the team for political advantage. The Raiders are in the final year of their lease at the even older Oakland Coliseum. The rundown stadium had sewage and electrical problems in the past year and is now the only stadium in the United States used as the home for both an NFL and Major League Baseball team, the Oakland Athletics. The team wants to build a new stadium at the site but talks with the city have shown little progress. Though Los Angeles does not have a team now, it has been home to the Chargers, Raiders and Rams in the last 60 years.

Oakland's rundown stadium had sewage and electrical problems in the past year and is now the only stadium in the United States used as the home for both an NFL and Major League Baseball team, the Oakland Athletics . The Chargers played their inaugural first season in Los Angeles before moving to San Diego in 1961. The Rams moved from Southern California to St. Louis after the 1994 season. After that same season, the Raiders returned to Oakland, where they had played from 1960, their first year a team, to 1981. The Rams's stadium struggle in St. Louis has made progress with a burgeoning plan for a 64,000-seat stadium there on the city's north riverfront. 'Our focus is 100 percent committed to keeping the Rams here in their home of St. Louis and ensuring that we remain an NFL city for generations to come,' said former Anheuser-Busch president Dave Peacock, who is heading effort to keep the Rams in St. Louis. 'We are very encouraged and thrilled with the progress we've made.' If plans to move continue, all NFL teams looking into stadiums in Los Angeles are targeting 2016 for relocation.

"President Obama was today accused of 'stonewalling' after the White House refused to disclose who attended a controversial conference on 'violent extremism'. The three-day summit has already been the focus of criticism after a repeated refusal by the president to call ISIS 'Islamic' during a speech and other remarks. Today the row deepened as a government watchdog said the White House had a duty to disclose exactly who it had invited to the talks. The president and federal officials this week welcomed representatives from more than 60 countries to Washington to discuss global efforts to wipe off the map extremist threats, namely ISIS and al Qaeda. Boasting today that attendees came from every continent, speak different languages, were born of different races and ethnic groups, and belong to different religions, Obama said they were at the three-day White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism because they 'are united against the scourge of violent extremism and terrorism.' President Barack Obama speaks at the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism at the State Department on Friday. In his speech Obama called on 'countries that are emerging and developing to create structures of governance and transparency' - even as his own administration was refusing to say who participated in the confab . Guests of the summit are pictured here at the U.S. Department of State at on Thursday. Just before close of business that day the White House gave out the names of the heads of delegation to the confab. Among the attendees were Russian Federal Security Service Director Alexander Bortnikov, who announced Wednesday that he would participate . Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, is pictured here with head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) Alexander Bortnikov, right, during a visit to Crimea in May of 2014. 'If Russian FSB Director Bortnikov can attend the summit and know who is there, then the American people certainly deserve to know,' a government watchdog agency said Thursday . It released on Wednesday some names, but the National Security Council refused on Thursday to give Daily Mail Online a detailed list. The State Department also sent out a list on Thursday afternoon but it didn't necessarily contain the names of all foreign officials who participated in that day's events. A statement provided on Wednesday to reporters who cover the White House contained the names of 32 people expected to attend that day's activities - not the full audience. It explicitly said that participants 'include' - making clear that it was a merely a partial list and not everyone it knew would attend. Among them were Lisa Monaco, assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, Hans Bont, the mayor of Vilvoorde, in Belgium, and Robert Trestan of the Anti-Defamation League. Daily Mail Online requested a complete record of attendees Thursday from the National Security Council. In an email exchange, a spokesperson for NSC suggested that the entire list had in fact been distributed to reporters and would not offer Daily Mail Online an additional copy. The spokesperson also claimed that the State Department had released a list of its own on Thursday, but the Daily Mail found no evidence of that.

'The American people are owed a complete list of all persons attending the CVE summit. Anything less is an insulting stonewalling and a continuation of the Obama administration's hypocritical ""transparency"" policy,' Chris Farrell, director of investigations for Judicial Watch, told Daily Mail Online Thursday afternoon.

"Selfie super-fan Kim Kardashian well and truly put contouring - a laborious method of applying make-up to enhance features - on the map in 2014. So popular did the technique become that hairdresser Charles Worthington introduced hair contouring in his salon and Marks & Spencer are getting set to unveil contouring tights in store next month. And now, Playtex has jumped on the bandwagon by unveiling the first top cup contouring bra, which, they say, is a 'major innovation' for women wanting to rediscover their full breast potential. Scroll down for video . Playtex has unveiled a new contouring bra, which promises to boost your assets, after discovering women want to emulate Holly Willoughby's . Makers of the £32 Contour Perfection bra say it's different - and innovative - because it features top cup padding. The bra comes with thin foam cups, which promise to restore fullness in the upper cup of the breast by moulding to them. This claims to help restore volume and shape to an area not usually considered in the padding of a bra. This extra padding, which is dubbed a morphologic system, moulds to the breast to help create a fuller, rounder shape. Makers of the £32 Contour Perfection bra say it's different - and innovative - because it features top cup padding, which claims to restore fullness in the breast . This extra padding, which is dubbed a morphologic system, moulds to the breast to help create a fuller, rounder shape . The new bra, which is available in sizes 32-42 B-E and 32-40 F, was launched on the back of research carried out by the brand, which revealed that half of women are unhappy with their assets. A thin foam cup has been inserted into the top of the bra to restore fullness in the upper cup . The study found a third of unsatisfied women have a cup size C-D, despite two thirds believing this is the ‘ideal’ cup size. The study suggests that changes to the breasts with age may be at the root of women’s discontent as  over half (58 per cent) said they’ve noticed significant changes to the shape of their breasts since turning 35. Changes concern more than six out of 10 women, with a staggering 88 per cent citing loss of fullness or increased sagginess as their main complaints. And when asked which celebrity’s assets they most admire for their fullness and rounded shape, nearly half of the women said Holly Willoughby, while only 2 per cent are in awe of Katie Price’s. Nigella Lawson also featured highly on the list of breasts most admired for their fullness and rounded shape, as did Kelly Brook and Katy Perry. A spokesperson for the brand said: 'The research findings prove there’s a real need amongst women for a bra that helps inject fullness back into their breasts, so we’re delighted to finally unveil Contour Perfection - a comfortable, stylish and truly transformative shape-perfecting bra that helps women restore natural fullness and a beautifully youthful shape.'

"Urbanised areas are more likely to be hit by frequent thunderstorms than rural areas of the same size, according to a new study. Researchers studied the 'births' of thunderstorms - known as storm initiations - between 1997 and 2013 and found a significant increase in densely populated areas such as Atlanta. And this has been tied to the increased pollution levels and rising temperature in these regions compared to rural areas in the same geographical location. By studying the 'births' of thunderstorms (stock image) - officially known as storm initiations - experts have found they occur more frequently in urbanised areas. This is tied to  increased pollution levels and rising temperature in these regions compared to rural areas of the same size in the same goegraphical location . Researchers from Northern Illinois University studied radar data to pinpoint where thunderstorm initiations occurred across the southeast US between 1997 and 2013. They found that urbanised areas such as Atlanta are 5 per cent more likely to be hit by thunderstorms, on a given day, than rural areas of the same size. 'Per year, that amounts to two or three more thunderstorms of the pop-up variety,' explained lead researcher Alex Haberlie. 'These originate over the city or downwind and are separate from large and more easily predicted weather events.' Storms were more likely to hit these urbanised areas during warmer months, in July and August, in the late afternoon and early evening. And the study found more 'births' occurred during the week than at weekends. These findings add further weight to the fact rising temperatures increase the frequency of storms, but also that increased pollution levels in urban areas play a major role.

They found that urbanised areas such as Atlanta are 5 per cent more likely to be hit by thunderstorms, on a given day, than rural areas of the same size . During the week, more businesses and factories produce emissions than at weekends, for example. Rural areas showed no significant differences between weekdays and weekends.

These findings add further weight to the fact rising temperatures increase the frequency of storms, but also that increased pollution levels in urban areas  play a major role. In addition to pollution, the study said urbanised areas cause more storms because they create 'urban heat-islands'. Concentrations of buildings can increase temperatures causing low pressures to form above cities, compared to high pressures in rural areas. This causes a so-called 'low-level atmospheric convergence', which forces air up into thunderstorms. Buildings may also change the flow and direction of winds, which in turn changes pressure levels and affects the upward movement of air.

This causes a so-called 'low-level atmospheric convergence', which forces air up into thunderstorms. Buildings may also change the flow and direction of winds, which in turn changes pressure levels and affects the upward movement of air. 'City planners, meteorologists and citizens who live in or near large urban areas should be aware of the increased risk,' Mr Haberlie continued. 'These storms can produce dangerous weather hazards, including lightning, hail, strong winds and flash floods, often with little or no warning.' As air is warmed by the sun and moves closer to the Equator, the air mass near the surface 'absorbs' water through evaporation. The warmer the air mass, the more water it takes up, and as it reaches the Equator, it begins to rise through the atmosphere, eventually cooling as it radiates heat out into space. Cool air typically holds less moisture than warm air, so as the air cools, condensation occurs, and heat is released. When enough heat is released, air begins to rise even further, pulling more air behind it, which ultimately causes a thunderstorm. As a result, many experts predict that global warming will cause the number of thunderstorms to increase and they are often used as indicators of rising temperatures and climate change. Thunderstorms get  energy from the heat released by the condensation of water vapour (illustrated). Using climate records, and simulations up to 2098, experts recently said warming will create more precipitation and less circulation. The number of storms will stay the same, but they will become more intense . However, earlier this month a separate study found that instead of increasing in number, storms will increase in intensity as the globe gets warmer - meaning the same number of storms will occur, but they'll be stronger. Researchers from the University of Toronto explained that the Earth's atmosphere needs fuel to work, which in this instance is energy from the sun. As air is warmed by the sun and moves closer to the Equator, the air mass near the surface 'absorbs' water through evaporation. The warmer the air mass, the more water it takes up, and as it reaches the Equator, it begins to rise through the atmosphere, eventually cooling as it radiates heat out into space. Cool air typically holds less moisture than warm air, so as the air cools, condensation occurs, and heat is released. When enough heat is released, air begins to rise even further, pulling more air behind it, which ultimately causes a thunderstorm. The 'output' of this atmospheric engine, and storms, is the amount of heat and moisture that is redistributed between the Equator and the North and South Poles. The  physicists said that this is because global warming will directly affect how the atmosphere circulates air mass, heat and water using what's been dubbed 'Earth's heat engine.' Frederic Laliberté and his colleagues from the University of Toronto compared climate records from 1981 to 2012 with climate simulations. This comparison revealed that a third of the atmospheric energy is typically involved with the movement of water through the cycle. But, as a result of climate change, the atmosphere is expected to use more energy during this part of the cycle. This is because the air will be warmer, so will take up more water, which will create more evaporation and precipitation. By using more energy to move the water, less energy is used to circulate the air mass, and an increase in water vapour, put simply, will make the process less efficient. The atmosphere still needs to get rid of the precipitation it collects, but because circulation is affected, it has to do this in fewer, more intense storms. Air masses that are able to reach the top of the atmosphere are strengthened, while those that can't, are weakened.","Researchers studied radar data in the southeast US from 1997 to 2013 .

"As President Barack Obama hit out at Republicans who have criticized his economic policies, he singled out Republican Senator Rand Paul - who previously said income inequality has worsened under Obama's administration. During the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting today, Obama remarked on Paul's 2013 comment that the Republican party needs to show up on the South Side of Chicago and shout: 'We are the party of jobs and opportunity'. The president said, while smiling, it is 'encouraging' that the 2016 presidential hopeful wants to go to his hometown and that Paul would be welcomed there, adding 'we are a friendly bunch'. Scroll down for video . As President Barack Obama (above during the Democratic National Committee winter meeting) hit out at Republicans who have criticized his economic policies, he singled out Senator Rand Paul - who previously said income inequality has worsened under Obama's administration . During the Democratic National Committee's winter meeting, Obama remarked on the Kentucky senator's (Rand Paul, right) comment that the Republican party needs to go to the South Side of Chicago, and shout: 'We are the party of jobs and opportunity' While giving his speech, Obama said it is 'not an accident' that the economy is improving under his watch, and chided Republican party critics for predictions that haven not come true, according to CNN. He said: 'Now that their grand predictions of doom and gloom and death panels and Armageddon haven't come true. The sky hasn't fallen, chicken little is quiet. 'The new plan is to re-brand themselves as the party of the middle class. I am not making this up.' The president also seemed to reference a comment made earlier this week by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who does not think Obama 'loves America'. In his speech, he said this is not an ideological battle or about putting notches on a belt, but that it is about 'making this nation we love more perfect'. Obama also said he welcomed the attention Republicans have been giving the middle class, 'but so far at least the rhetoric has not matched the reality.' He gave a rousing defense of his economic policies and promoted his agenda as the right policy and political prescriptions for Democrats heading into the 2016 elections. While Obama said he was willing to hear Republican ideas for helping the middle class, he also argued that the best way for Republicans to prove their commitment was by supporting his call for a higher minimum wage . He said the party's belief in 'middle class economics' has spurred economic growth and job creation. 'I just want everybody to remember that at every step as we made these policies, made this progress, we were told by our good friends the Republicans that our actions would crush jobs, explode deficits and destroy the country,' he said. 'If we were actually to look at the evidence, it's pretty clear who's theory of how to grow the economy and make sure American people are prospering, which theory works. We know their ideas don't work.' With the economic recovery showing signs of taking hold, Democrats and Republicans have turned their attention to improving wages for working class Americans. Obama also seemed to reference a comment made earlier this week by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani (above), who doubted Obama's love of the country. The president said this is not an ideological battle or about putting notches on a belt, but that it is about 'making this nation we love more perfect' While incomes have increased modestly recently, they hardly make up for decades of paycheck stagnation. Both sides, however, have distinctly different views of how to boost wages. Democrats want increases in the minimum wage, while Republicans call for fewer regulations and taxes on business to free more capital that could be used for wage growth. 'If you are serious, if you are really troubled with income inequality,' Obama said, 'then you can't put forward proposals that give more tax breaks to folks who are doing the best.' While Obama said he was willing to hear Republican ideas for helping the middle class, he also argued that the best way for Republicans to prove their commitment was by supporting his call for a higher minimum wage. 'The shift in rhetoric that they're engaging in is good if it actually leads them to take different actions,' he said.","During Democratic National Committee's winter meeting, president targeted Republicans who are 're-branding themselves as party of middle class'

"They say every picture tells a story and that's certainly true of a new time-lapse video that reveals 100 years of Iran's history with the help of a beautiful model. The '100 Years of Beauty' clip shows Iranian-American model Sabrina Sarajy being given a number of make-overs and then posing with a look that sums up the style of each decade. The pictures show how fashion and beauty trends have changed over the years with iconic hair styles such as the finger waves of the Twenties and beehive of the Sixties. Scroll down for video . The first look in the 100 Years Of Beauty video shows model Iranian-American model Sabrina wearing a white hijab with a monobrow and no make-up. Iranian women at this time had few rights . By the Twenties, women are gaining greater freedom, the hijab is a vibrant purple shade and exposes more of the hair which is styled in finger waves fashionable around the globe at the time . But beneath the hair and make-up is a serious reflection on how the turbulent politics in Iran have influenced the appearance and role of women in society. The video begins with Sabrina make-up free with her long, frizzy hair lose around her shoulders. She is then given a 1910 makeover which means wearing a white hijab. She does not have any make-up on to reflect the fact it was not worn by Iranian women at this time but her eyebrows are penciled in to create a monobrow, which many women had at the time as plucking, threading or waxing their eyebrows was not an option. Women at this time had few rights and were excepted to be subservient to men - as reflected in Sabrina's sombre expression. In the Thirties, the hijab was banned shown by Sabrina ditching hers for a hat . The Iranian look of the Forties was one also popular in Britain and America - wavy hair and red lips . After 1910, the Iranian women's movement was established and the first Women Journal was published by women as they began to campaign for more rights and freedom. This hopeful uprising is reflected in the fashion at the time. By the Twenties, women are still wearing a hijab but now it's a vibrant purple shade and exposes more of the hair. Sabrina's look reflects the global trend at the time for finger waves in the hair while her eyebrows have now also now been styled. In the 1930s, the female movement really took off as Reza Shah Pahlavi came into power and banned the hijab. He believed that the headscarf was suppressing women. The ban is shown in Sabrina's Thirties pose as she ditches her veil for a jaunty hat - fashionable at the time - over a curled hairstyle also in style across the world in the Thirties. Her red lipstick - another Thirties global trend - shows how make-up is starting to be embraced by more women. For the Forties look, Sabrina again shows how Iranian women at the time where influenced by style in the west. Her loose, curly hair and vibrant red lips would were replicated at the time by women in Britain and America. The model's broad smile as she poses shows how women at this time felt free, happy and hopeful. The bold lipstick remains in the Fifties but the hair is more prim in the post Word War Two years . The iconic beehive was embraced by Iranian woman in the Sixties as well as feline flick eyeliner . In the post World War Two years in the Fifties, Sabrina's style is more subdued than in the Forties, the make-up remains but the lips as toned down to pink and the hair is curled but pinned back to look more prim and demure. The Sixties look is another iconic style that would have been seen in capital cities in Europe and America as well as in Iran. This was the decade of the beehive and Sabrina's hair is piled up to create the look. Meanwhile her heavy make-up also reflects the trend for a feline flick of eyeliner to make the eyes appear bigger. Women at this time in Iran were being given greater freedom, respect and power. They were beginning to establish careers with Farrokhroo Parsa becoming the first woman to hold a cabinet position as Minister of Education in 1969. In the Seventies, the heavy make-up remains with smokey eyes while the hair is Charlie's Angels inspired with long, loose waves. Sabrina again looks happy and flirtatious as she flicks her hair over her shoulder. During the Seventies, Iranian women were granted equal rights in marriage and divorce and it appeared their oppression was coming to an end. But this all changed in the Eighties, as reflected in Sabrina's look which is more reminiscent of the 1910 pose. A Charlie's Angels inspired look in the Seventies with loose wavy hair and smokey eye make-up reflecting how Iranian women had more freedom at this time - but it was all about to change . After the 1979 Iranian Revolution the hijab was enforced again and women were stripped of many rights . In 1979, the Iranian Revolution took place and the status of women regressed. Wearing the hijab was enforced, many of the rights they had been granted were withdrawn and Parsa was executed. Sabrina's look reflects the repression of the time as she wears a black headscarf that completely covers her head and neck - save for one strand of loose hair which she obediently tucks out of sight. She's stripped of make-up and her face is downcast and unhappy. By the Nineties, she's smiling again. The hijab remains but now it's a vibrant blue shade with spots and it doesn't cover her forehead as much so her parted hair can be seen. She clasps her hands as if praying for a better future. Sabrina clasps her hands as if praying in the Nineties as her look remain plain and downcast but her hijab is a brighter shade reflecting some hope for the future . The Green Revolution is shown in the 2000s look with Sabrina wearing a green hijab and war paint . Sabrina's next look reflects the Green Revolution in Iran and their ongoing struggle to attain human and civil rights. The model dons a green hijab with the front strands of her hair loose around her face and she applies green war paint across her cheeks. She rises her hand - also covered in green paint - in a V sign and her eye make-up is muted shades of green as she stares defiantly into the camera. For the final look , Sabrina's hair is long and loose around her shoulders and then loosely covered with a bright red hijab which she later pulls down so it rests on her shoulders. Her make-up is pretty but subtle and she confidently smiles at the camera before walking off screen. The clip is the fourth in The Cut's series of time lapse beauty videos. In previous videos, they have shown how women's style and fashion in American has changed over the past 100 years. The final most up-to-date look shows Sabrina in a red hijab with her hair long and loose round her shoulders .","'100 Years of Beauty' clip features Iranian-American model Sabrina Sarajy .

"She might be just one year old but Sweden's Princess Leonore, who celebrates her first birthday today, is well on her way to emulating her mother's stellar sense of style. New photos of the toddler, which were released to mark her big day, show her perched in a gilt-edged arm chair and wearing a delicate rose-pink dress. Her besotted mother, 32-year-old Princess Madeleine, captioned the pictures: 'Leonore, our little sunshine turns 1 year old today!' Scroll down for video . Celebrating: Little Princess Leonore of Sweden celebrates her first birthday today . Leonore's birthday comes at the start of a busy year for the Swedish royals, with 2015 set to include a royal wedding and the arrival of a little brother or sister for the one-year-old. In December, Madeleine, who is fourth-in-line to the Swedish throne, announced she was expecting a second child with her husband, British businessman Christopher O'Neill. Speaking in a statement released by the Sveriges Kungahus, or Swedish Royal Court, the parents-to-be said they were 'very happy' and looking forward to the birth. Unlike Princess Leonore, who was born in New York's Weill Cornell Medical Center, the new baby will be born in Stockholm following her parents' move to the city last summer. The birth is likely to coincide with another big royal event, the wedding of Madeleine's older brother, Prince Carl Philip, 35, on the 13th June. Big day: New official photos of the one-year-old were released by the Sveriges Kungahus to mark the event . Glamorous: Leonore's mother Madeleine, pictured at the Nobel ceremony in December, is expecting . His bride-to-be, 30-year-old Sofia Hellqvist, is a former glamour model - a career that was the source of controversy when the couple's relationship was made public in January 2010. Ms Hellqvist is expected to become Princess Sofia of Sweden following the wedding, although her title will not be officially decided until the ceremony. Having posed topless in Swedish men's magazines, Ms Hellqvist hit tabloid headlines in 2005 after reaching the final of the scandalous sex and alcohol-fuelled TV show Paradise Hotel. The shows sees five men and five women stay in a hotel together and included a scene in which Sofia was shown kissing pornstar Jenna Jameson. However, in 2009, after she met Carl Philip, who is third in line to the throne, in a club, she has softened her image. Romantic: Princess Madeleine, pictured at her 2013 wedding, is married to Briton Christopher O'Neill, 40 . Next in line: Prince Carl Philip will marry fiancee Sofia Hellqvist in Stockholm on the 13th June . The relationship was controversial for a time, as Queen Silvia apparently did not entirely approve of the match. But it is the prince himself who has the most colourful past, with his 'Wild Summer' of 2012 still referenced by Sweden's tabloid press which delightedly documented his antics. As well as going on a drunken rampage in central Stockholm while wearing an alien mask, the summer also saw him become the victim of a happy slapping incident during a holiday to Cannes. He also, following a wild night out, managed to lose his wallet and was forced to hitch-hike to the motor race he was due to compete in, before spectacularly crashing his car on the first lap. As the only son of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, the prince was the heir to the throne for a seven months after he was born in May 1979. But in January 1980 the rules were changed and the principle of primogeniture was introduced, meaning the throne will be inherited by the monarch's eldest child, Crown Princess Victoria. She will be succeeded by her daughter Estelle, who was born in February 2012.

"A Texas teacher will be giving one of her students something far more valuable than any grade could ever be - a new kidney. First grade student Matthew Parker, 6, will be receiving a new kidney from Lindsey Painter, his teacher at Hoffmann Lane Elementary School in New Braunfels. Parker first received a kidney transplant from a deceased donor when he was two, but needs a new one because his body is rejecting the organ. Scroll down for video . Matthew Parker, 6, (pictured) will be receiving a new kidney from his first grade teacher Lindsey Painter . Painter (left) teaches Parker (right) at Hoffmann Lane Elementary School in New Braunfels, Texas . Parker's mother Lisa (right) said Painter it 'still feels like a dream' that Painter was a match for her son . Parker, one of three triplets who are all taught by Painter, and his family made a public plea for a donor in December and people from all over the United States tried to help. It wasn't easy to find a donor for Parker because of his prior transplant and doctors put the odds of finding an exact match at about one per cent, according to KXAN. After sorting through more than 80 applications, doctors finally found a perfect match - Painter. She said: 'It's hard not to feel like this is the way things were meant to be. 'Everything has fallen into place and it's happened that way for a reason.' Painter worked as a teacher in the Comal Independent School District for 13 years before coming to Hoffman . Parker and his two brothers are all students in Painter's first grade class at Hoffman Lane Elementary . Painter began working at Hoffman Lane last summer, My Fox Austin reported. She has worked as a teacher in the Comal Independent School District for 13 years but decided to transferred to Hoffmann Lane to be closer to her family. The surgery is going to happen next month and Parker and Painter will each miss about six weeks of school. Donors must be between the ages of 21 and 60, and in excellent health. Donors must understand risks and complications, and must be in a stable life situation with family or social support to help during recovery time. Donors can be family members or relatives, friends, etc. You do not have to be a blood relative of the recipient. Source: University Transplant Center . To make things even easier on Painter, the school is going to make up for her lost wages. She said: 'Matthew's insurance will cover my portion of the surgery and my amazing campus has stepped up to cover the income that I'll lose while I'm out of work.' The average donor kidney lasts about ten to 12 years. Matthew's mother, Lisa Parker, said: ''It still feels like a dream. 'For it to be an exact match too, it was a miracle. 'There's no words that can say anything because it's more than thank you, it's deeper.' Doctors performed 16,896 kidney transplants in 2013, but only 5,733 of those came from living donors, according to the National Kidney Foundation. Only 639 of those donations came from people who were not related to the person who needed the kidney.","Matthew Parker of New Braunfels, Texas, will be the kidney recipient .

"Professor Stephen Hawking believes the future of the human race depends on our abilities to explore space. During a tour of London's Science Museum, the 73-year-old said that landing on the moon gave us new perspectives of life on Earth, and this outlook must develop if we are to survive. He also said aggression should be weeded out of the human race and replaced by empathy to avoid a major nuclear war ending civilisation as we know it. Professor Hawking (file photo shown) was speaking at London's Science Museum. He said space travel is vital to the future of the human race. And he also said aggression should be replaced by empathy. 'A major nuclear war would be the end of civilisation, and maybe the end of the human race,' he said . Professor Hawking made the comments while escorting an American visitor around the museum as part of a 'Guest of Honour' prize. Adaeze Uyanwah, 24, from Palmdale, California, won the tour after producing a blog and video describing a 'perfect day' in the UK capital. She asked Professor Hawking what human shortcomings he would alter, and which virtues he would enhance if this was possible. He replied: 'The human failing I would most like to correct is aggression. It may have had survival advantage in caveman days, to get more food, territory or partner with whom to reproduce, but now it threatens to destroy us all. In November, Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind Space-X and Tesla, warned that the risk of 'something seriously dangerous happening' as a result of machines with artificial intelligence, could be in as few as five years. He has previously linked the development of autonomous, thinking machines, to 'summoning the demon'. Speaking at MIT's AeroAstro Centennial Symposium in October, Musk described artificial intelligence as our 'biggest existential threat'. He said: 'I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence. 'I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish. 'With artificial intelligence we're summoning the demon. You know those stories where there's the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he's sure he can control the demon? Doesn't work out.' 'A major nuclear war would be the end of civilisation, and maybe the end of the human race. 'The quality I would most like to magnify is empathy. It brings us together in a peaceful, loving state.' The professor added that human space exploration was 'life insurance' for the human race and must continue. 'Sending humans to the moon changed the future of the human race in ways that we don't yet understand,' he said. 'It hasn't solved any of our immediate problems on planet Earth, but it has given us new perspectives on them and caused us to look both outward and inward. 'I believe that the long term future of the human race must be space and that it represents an important life insurance for our future survival, as it could prevent the disappearance of humanity by colonising other planets.' Ms Uyanwah, a teacher and creative writer, who beat more than 10,000 international contestants to win the prize, said: 'It's incredible to think that decades from now, when my grandchildren are learning Stephen Hawking's theories in science class, I'll be able to tell them I had a personal meeting with him and heard his views first hand. It's something I'll never forget.' The Guest of Honour competition was organised by VisitLondon.com. In December 2014, Professor Hawking issued another warning - that artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Speaking at event in London, the physicist told the BBC that: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' The professor added that human space exploration was 'life insurance' for the human race and must continue. 'Sending humans to the moon changed the future of the human race in ways that we don't yet understand,' he said. Shown is an illustration of Nasa's Orion spacecraft . And in January, a group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Professor Hawking, signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity. The letter warned that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. And the authors said there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society.","Professor Stephen Hawking was speaking at London's Science Museum .

"Pictures have emerged of the 22-month-old boy who died after being left in a hot car outside a day care centre on Thursday. Noah Krespanis was found in a car parked outside a home on Acacia Drive in Kyneton, north-west of Melbourne in 31 degree heat. The car window was smashed in order to rescue Noah but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. Pictures have emerged of 22-month-old Noah, who died after being left in a hot car outside a day care centre on Thursday . The toddler was found unconscious by a family member while strapped in a car seat in the Toyota Hilux parked outside the home about 3pm on Thursday. It has been reported that temperatures would have reached up to 60 degrees inside the car on the hot Summer day. Noah's distraught father posted an emotional social media message on Thursday, urging parents to 'cherish every day' they get to spend with their children. Taking to his Twitter page, a devastated Mr Krespanis paid tribute to his son making a heartfelt plea to parents urging them to hug their children and 'never let them go'. 'We lost our beautiful son today,' he wrote on the social media account on Thursday. 'Hug your children. Hug them and never let them go.' 'I love him more every day. Forever.' he said, referring to his baby boy. 'I'll always know I cherished every day. Every laugh, every adventure, every cuddle. Miss you noey X.' The toddler was found unconscious by a family member while strapped in a car seat in the Toyota Hilux parked outside the home about 3pm on Thursday . The body of an infant boy was found in a vehicle on Acacia Drive in Kyneton (pictured) on Thursday . Mr Krespanis' post comes just hours after it was revealed that Noah's mother is too distraught to speak to police. Homicide squad Detective Senior Sergeant Shane O'Connell said the mother was present when he was found in the car, but said police investigating the incident would not speak to her for days, the Herald Sun reported. 'As you can imagine the family of this young boy are devastated by what has occurred so it's been difficult for us to try and piece together exactly what has occurred but that's something that will be the focus of our major ongoing investigation,' Det Sen Sgt O'Connell said. 'She's absolutely devastated by what has occurred. It's a very tragic set of circumstances.' The owner of a separate local childcare centre said they were heartbroken over the tragedy . The childcare centre where a 22-month-old boy was found dead in a hot car parked outside was privately-run and operated out of a family home . The woman who operates the family day care is part of a well-known local family and runs the business from her house, The Age reported. The family day care's father said his daughter was 'distraught', but said the family would not be speaking publicly until police had finished their investigation. There is no suggestion the childcare centre owner was involved in Noah's death. Police are investigating whether a female relative of the 22-month-old had forgotten the child was in the vehicle. The 22-month-old boy was apparently found by a family member . Victorian homicide detectives are trying to establish whether the woman mistakenly thought she had dropped the toddler at a childcare centre in the morning before continuing with her regular routine, the Herald Sun reported. Temperatures in Kyneton reached 31 degrees at the time of the tragedy. The woman ran a regulated family day care service through Bambini Child Care Services, a company that trains educators to take care of children from their home. A spokeswoman for Family Day Care Australia, of which Bambini is a member, said: 'Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family and all those affected by this tragedy.' They refused to comment on any other details while police were conducting inquiries. The owner of a separate local business - Kyneton Family Day Care - posted on her Facebook page: 'The only information I can give regarding the accident in Kyneton this afternoon is that I am absolutely heartbroken for the family and my friend.' Inspector Ryan Irwin said at the scene: 'I understand the boy has been found by a family member and paramedics were called and obviously there were attempts made to try and revive the child.' Insp Irwin said homicide squad detectives would oversee the investigation, and called the incident an 'absolute tragedy'. 'We're devastated,' Inspector Irwin said, according to the Herald Sun. '[The family are] devastated, absolutely devastated and we're still trying to track some family members down to actually notify them.' Officers were still at the scene on Acacia Drive in Kyneton, 100km north-west of Melbourne hours after the awful discovery. Neighbours of the house the baby boy was found outside said the residency doubled as a childcare centre, the ABC reported. Neighbours of the house the baby boy was found outside said the residency doubled as a childcare centre . The suburb, which is about 100km north-west of Melbourne, recorded temperatures of 31 degrees . Homicide detectives have been called into the investigation but this is 'common procedure' according to police. Ambulance Victoria would not comment on the latest case, but has issued repeated warnings against leaving children in cars. In the first five weeks of the year, paramedics were called to 200 cases. Most recently, a young girl had to be rushed to the Royal Children's Hospital after being locked in a hot vehicle at Maribyrnong, 4km west of Melbourne, for just half an hour after her mother couldn't open the doors. 'The girl was sweating profusely and her clothes were drenched, so there was certainly potential for it to quickly become life threatening,' advanced life support paramedic Ben Dalton said. 'The MFB smashed a window to get the girl out of the car.' It comes after Ambulance Victoria were called in to help at least six young children locked in hot cars in separate incidents last week, and a total of 200 children in the first five weeks of 2015 . Mr Dalton said two children have died in the last few years after being left in hot cars in Victoria, and it's frustrating the message is not getting through. 'Children can't regulate their body temperature like adults can, which puts them at significant risk,' he said. 'It's never okay to leave a child locked in a car, even for a minute or two.' The state government said it will increase penalties for leaving children in hot cars, with fines up to $3700 and jail time increased from three months to six months.","Pictures have emerged of Noah Krespanis who died when left in a hot car .

"In the wake of the Baby Gammy scandal and a string of similar cases, the Thai government has passed a law criminalising surrogacy and prohibiting foreigners from seeking surrogacy services. The law, which prohibits the act of hiring women commercially to carry foetuses to term, aims to stop Thailand from being a surrogacy hub for foreign couples. It comes after a several scandals involving Australian citizens this year, including the infamous Baby Gammy saga and the tandem threat it sparked for a Victorian couple, who almost lost triplet girls they arranged through a surrogate. Scroll down for video . The world watched on in horror as baby Gammy was left abandoned by his Australian parents . It was reported that Wendy (left) and David (right) Farnell returned to Australia from Thailand with his healthy twin sister Pipah (centre) but left Gammy behind . Thai surrogate Pattaramon Chanbua, who alleged the Farnell couple from West Australia abandoned Gammy when they found out he had Down syndrome . National Legislative Assembly member Wanlop Tangkananurak said the new laws are intended to evade such recent incidents. 'Surrogacy business leaves too much long-term trouble for Thailand, so we are banning foreign couples from seeking surrogacy in our country to avoid being a hub and to prevent what we saw last year,' Wanlop said. The parliament voted 160 to 2 to pass the law Thursday night. Under the new law, a Thai couple is allowed to seek a surrogate to carry the fetus only if they are able to prove that they and their relatives are infertile. It also says that anyone involved in commercial surrogacy will face a maximum jail term of 10 years and a maximum fine of 200,000 baht ($6,100). Shannon Sanderson, 38, and Peter Trigg, 44, nearly lost the beautiful triplet girls they arranged through aThai surrogate mother, when a Perth couple abandoned their disabled son Gammy in Thailand . The Thai Government has criminalising surrogacy in a bid to evade any further surrogacy scandals . Thailand was one of the few countries in Asia where commercial surrogacy was not specifically banned by law. There was however a regulation stating that doctors risk losing their license if they perform surrogacy for pay. Thailand became a go-to destination for couples from Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan and a low-cost alternative to the United States. National Assembly of Thailand, where the parliament voted 160 to 2 to pass the surrogacy law on Thursday night . Thailand was one of the few countries in Asia where commercial surrogacy was not specifically banned by law . But this led to a string of scandals. In July 2014, a West Australian couple were accused abandoning an infant known as Baby Gammy, leaving him with with his surrogate mother learning he had Down Syndrome. Thai surrogate Pattaramon Chanbua alleged Wendy and David Farnell-the latter being a convicted child sex offender-left Gammy and returned to Western Australia with his healthy twin sister, Pipah. Two Victorian men, Shannon Sanderson, 38, and Peter Trigg, 44, were terrified the scandal would mean they may never get to see the faces of their unborn triplets. As the news broke around the world, Thai surrogate agencies went into lockdown, disconnecting their phones and shutting off email connections. The Gammy saga cast a controversial light on the largely unregulated business of commercial surrogacy . But Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop stepped in, negotiating with the Thai military to allow the couple caeess to the country and their children. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs estimated that 50 Thai surrogate mothers are expected to carry babies for Australian couples by the end of 2015. There is currently a changeover period being debated to enable the children and their Australian parents to depart Thailand.","The law prohibited foreigners from seeking surrogacy services .

"More than half of all dog owners would be sadder if their pet died than if an uncle, aunt or grandparent passed away. Nearly nine in ten consider their dog a ‘fully-fledged’ member of the family.

Nearly nine in ten consider their dog a ‘fully-fledged’ member of the family, a survey has revealed . The survey of 1,500 dog owners was carried out by Crufts sponsor Samsung. It discovered 56 per cent of those polled would mourn the death of their dog more than that of an extended family member. Half admitted their dog’s needs had influenced a major life decision such as where they lived or what job they had. When it comes to dogs’ names, many people are being influenced by TV shows or films. The most popular is Dexter, with Sherlock, Mr Darcy and Yoda also in the top ten. Rex and Rover are nowhere to be seen. One in four dog owners have also given their pet its own social-media profile. Andy Griffiths, head of Samsung Electronics UK and Ireland, said: ‘It is fascinating to see how the lifestyles of our pets are evolving in tandem with ours. ‘It’s particularly interesting to see how we are sharing technology and involving our pets in this element of modern life.’ The survey also discovered that the average dog owner splashes out £1,011.72 a year on their pet. The average amount of time spent with a pooch is 13 hours a week. And one in two dog owners believes their pet knows what they are thinking or what mood they are in.

"Patients should be able to top-up their NHS treatment with an extr payment in return for an ‘enhanced’ service, a report suggests. Stock photo . Patients should have the option to top-up their NHS treatment with small monthly payment in return for an ‘enhanced’ service, a report suggests. Allowing people who can afford it to invest extra money would raise billions of pounds and give all patients a better healthcare experience, the authors say. Those who choose to pay - a sum starting from £100 per year for someone on a wage of £20,000 - would still receive the standard service in NHS hospitals and clinics. But by voluntarily paying extra they could avoid long waiting times for procedures and seek treatment in any centre in the country if they are subject to a postcode lottery where they live, according to the report by the think tank Civitas. It recommends that better-off patients be able to buy extra treatment, which is not currently available, from NHS trusts as well as private providers. The authors, NHS consultant Dr Christoph Lees and researcher Edmund Stubbs argue that this ‘contribution scheme’ would alleviate the current stress on the health service and offset the need for higher taxes across the board, while also staying true to the principle of free healthcare at the point of use. They say polls show there is a ‘public appetite’ for increased contributions to the health service, with one survey suggesting 60pc of the public would be willing to pay increased income tax if it went towards healthcare. ‘The proposed NHS contribution scheme would help safe-guard the NHS's core commitment to meeting the needs of everyone’, they say. ‘Where NHS services are known to be poor, the alternative of seeking treatment elsewhere will be available to patients. This is one means of challenging the existing 'postcode lottery' where patients have widely differing quality of NHS treatment in different areas of the country. ‘Money raised from the contribution fee could then be invested in these weak or inefficient aspects of NHS service, improving the level of care for those who use them, even where they are non-contributors to the scheme.’ Allowing patients to top up what is known as their ‘personal budget’ set by the NHS, would save money and avert the need for any further reorganisations of the health service, they say. ‘It would simply act as an add-on; allowing individual patients who chose to contribute, an increased personal choice of provider instead of having to use those providers made available by the present block tendering out of services by commissioners.’ They propose a contribution of 0.5pc of income deducted each month from their payroll like income tax. They believe the scheme could raise £3.5 billion a year depending on how many people sign up. The authors, NHS consultant Dr Christoph Lees and researcher Edmund Stubbs, argue that this ‘contribution scheme’ would alleviate the current stress on the health service . After four consecutive monthly payments - to avoid individuals contributing only when anticipating illness - those who take part would be entitled to access their personal treatment budget. ‘The additional income could encourage investment in separate facilities for elective procedures that are often cancelled at short notice when there is pressure on A&E departments’. Contributors could also benefit from extras aimed at encouraging people to take more responsibility for their own health, such as annual ‘health MOTs’ for a lower price than with private providers. The health service is projected to face a £30billion funding hap by the year 2020. Both the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have promised billions more for the NHS over the next five years but will still fall short of the funding needed. The Civitas proposal would create a two-tier system, as the authors acknowledge, but they say this has already been created by the advent of private healthcare. But critics suggest that if the middle classes take on fees and receive better treatment, they may be less likely to stand up and flight for better services for all. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ‘The NHS will remain free at the point of use and patients can already choose where they have NHS treatment.’","Allowing those who can afford it to invest extra would raise billions and give all patients a better healthcare experience, report says .

"Malaria that is completely resistant to drug treatment could soon spread into India putting millions of lives at risk, scientists have warned. Experts have discovered a strain of the parasite in Burma that is totally resistant to the antimalarial drug artemisinin, which they have described as an 'enormous threat'. Worryingly, the resistant parasites have been found just 15 miles from the country's border with India in an 'alarming development'. Danger: Malaria is spread by mosquitoes and scientists say the resistant parasites found in the Saigang region of Burma, just 15 miles from India, in an 'alarming development' If the spread of artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites were to reach into India, that would pose a serious threat to the chances of global control of the killer disease. Philippe Guerin, director of the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network, said: 'The pace at which artemisinin resistance is spreading or emerging is alarming.' 'We need a more vigorous international effort to address this issue in border regions.' In a study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases . journal, experts collected 940 parasite samples at 55 . malaria treatment centres across Burma - also known as Myanmar - and its border regions. Similar strains have also been detected in Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. They found that almost 40 percent of the samples had mutations . in their so-called kelch gene, K13 -- a known genetic signal of . artemisinin drug resistance. Charles Woodrow of the Mahidol-Oxford tropical medicine research unit led the study at Oxford University, said: 'Myanmar is considered the front line in the battle against artemisinin resistance as it forms a gateway for resistance to spread to the rest of the world.' If resistance spreads from Asia to Africa, or emerges in . Africa independently, 'millions of lives . will be at risk', the report said. Deaths from malaria have nearly halved since 2000, and the infection now kills an estimated 600,000 people each year - most of them children in the poorest parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Fatal: Malaria kills an estimated 600,000 people each year - most of them children in the poorest parts of sub-Saharan Africa . Woodrow noted that thanks to advances in the science of . genetic analysis, researchers tracking artemisinin antimalarials . are in 'the unusual position of having molecular markers for . resistance before resistance has spread globally'. He added: 'The more we understand about the current situation...the . better prepared we are to adapt and implement strategies to . overcome the spread of further drug resistance.' From the late 1950s to the 1970s, chloroquine-resistant malaria spread across Asia to Africa, leading to a resurgence of cases and millions of deaths. Chloroquine was replaced by sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), but resistance to SP subsequently emerged in western Cambodia and again spread to Africa. SP was replaced by artemisinin combination treatment, or ACT, and experts now worry that history may repeat itself yet again.","Scientists discover strain of parasite that is totally resistant to treatment .

"When a Virginia teenager asked his mom to stop the car so he could get out in the cold and help an elderly man shovel snow, he was just doing it out of the kindness of his heart. But when his mom posted a picture of the selfless good deed on Facebook, Tommy Adams' good deed won praise across the US. The 18-year-old, who spends snow days clearing snow and ice from neighborhood driveways and sidewalks in rural Nottoway County, took pity on Clarence Coleman, aged 76. Scroll down for video . Tommy Adams did not think twice about asking his mum Teresa to stop the car so he could get out and help Clarence Coleman, pictured in the background with his walker, clear a mountain of snow from his driveway. This picture went viral when Ms Adams posted it on Facebook . Mr Coleman praised his young helper, saying 'the good lord could bless' the kindhearted high school senior . The old man had a walker with him as he strugged to clear a mountain of snow from his driveway when Tommy and his mum Teresa drove past on their way home from the DMV. 'Tommy said ""Mamma stop the car,''' Teresa Adams recalled. 'I got scared and asked ""what's wrong?'' 'He said, ""there's an older man with a walker shoveling snow — I'll help him out,""' she added. Tommy approached the man and asked him for the snow shovel. 'He looked surprised,' Teresa said. 'I was so proud, I started to cry.' Teresa snapped a photo of her son's good deed, which was later shared on the WTVR CBS 6 News Facebook page. 'He was relieved; he looked tired,' Tommy said. 'I told him to get back into his car because it was cold. Other people who saw him in the snow should have had the decency to stop.' Eighteen-year-old Tommy often spends snow days clearing snow and ice from neighborhood driveways . His mum Teresa Adams said 'I was so proud, I started to cry', at her son's selfless good deed . Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe was one of many to praise Tommy Adams' actions on social media . Tommy said it appeared a plow had driven by and built up the snow on the man's driveway along Old Nottoway Road. He said the snow was deep and it took him more than 15 minutes to clear the driveway for the man. 'He said ""God bless you, the world needs more people like you""', Tommy recalled. Tommy said he did not catch the man's name at the time, but he was glad he was there to help. 'I try to do good for the elderly because one day I may need help too,' Tommy said. Mr Coleman praised his young helper, saying of Tommy and his mum: 'They are good people. 'The good lord can bless them and they will have good luck as long as they live.' People took to Twitter to praise the teenager for his good deed. One said: 'Kudos to this teen. Goodness and decency has no color or age limit.' Another added: 'We always hear about the bad, but not enough about the good. WTG Tommy Adams!'

"As menus go, it sounds more like a gruesome task from I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! than something you would choose to eat. But bugs of all types including grasshoppers and worms will be served at Britain's first insect restaurant when it opens this summer. Grub Kitchen in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, South Wales, will be the UK's first to focus entirely on insect produce, according to trade magazine The Caterer yesterday. Head chef Andrew Holcroft told The Caterer: 'We want to pioneer the movement to normalise the eating of bugs on a day-to-day basis.' Bugs of all types including grasshoppers and worms will be served at Britain's first insect restaurant - Grub Kitchen . 'We are treating them as a normal food item, incorporating insect protein as an ingredient but using normal flavours we are familiar with and everyday food items we recognise. 'I am a firm believer that people are not going to stop eating meat -- that goes against biology -- so bugs are also going to sit next to normal dishes on the menu. 'For example, we are serving both bug burgers and lamb kebabs. It will be part of Dr Benyon's Bug Farm, where Mr Holcroft's partner Dr Sarah Kenyon will run insect workshops.

Along with cooking demonstrations and interactive tasting events at Grub Kitchen, the pair hope to raise awareness of the environmental and health benefits surrounding entomophagy. Mexican food chain Wahaca sold 1,500 plates a week of its fried-cricket special during a month-long trial throughout January. Marketing manager Oli Ingham said: ' The experiment has been a great step in the right direction and hopefully one that will change our food map for ever. We hope we have inspired other restaurants to do the same thing. ' Entomophagy – the human consumption of insects – seems to be getting more popular. Mexican chain Wahaca is selling a dish with crickets at its Covent Garden branch this month and next.","Grub Kitchen will be Britain's first insect restaurant when it opens this year .

"This is the dramatic moment a self-styled 'paedophile hunter' snared a pervert in an internet sting by posing as a 13-year-old girl. Disgraced former solicitor Martin Currier, 51, was arrested after attempting to meet up with the youngster he sexually groomed online. A court heard Currier drove 54 miles to see who he thought was a teenager called 'Jodie' after striking up a relationship over social media. Scroll down for video . Martin Currier, pictured, was arrested after he arranged to meet a 13-year-old girl in person over the internet . Currier, 51, groomed what he thought was a 13-year-old girl before travelling to meet her in person . However, Currier had been snared by paedophile catcher Stinson Hunter, pictured, who alerted police . But the scene was actually a set up and engineered by notorious paedophile catcher - Stinson Hunter - who created the fake alias to snare the culprit. When Currier arrived at the house in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, the paedophile did not find the girl but was instead greeted by Mr Hunter and his recording crew. They filmed the moment Currier arrived at the house expecting to meet the 13-year-old, before being confronted by Mr Hunter. In a three minute 34 second video of the encounter, Currier can be seen confirming he messaged the girl but claiming he was trying to help her. Mr Hunter reads out messages the paedophile had sent including one that said: 'If we had a cuddle and you aroused me that could cause a bit of a problem.' Currier also wrote to what he thought was the teenage girl: 'You might get a bit aroused yourself and I'm not very good with temptation.' In front of the cameras, Currier accepted he had been 'inappropriate' but claimed he was just being 'cheeky with her'. In the video, Currier, who now works as a bookmaker, is then told that the police had been informed, and he is seen getting into his car and driving away. Shrewsbury Crown Court heard that Currier was struck off as a solicitor after he forged a client's will . Currier, from Wellington, Shropshire, denied a charge of attempting to meet a child after sexual grooming and claimed he was trapped into going to Nuneaton. During the trial he had claimed he only went to visit the girl to 'boost her confidence'. But a jury took just one hour of deliberating to find Currier guilty at Shrewsbury Crown Court. Recorder Martin Butterworth adjourned sentence for reports until March 26, and warned Currier that he could face a prison term. Following the verdict the jury heard that Currier had previously worked as a solicitor but was struck off in 2002 after he was jailed for fraud having obtained almost £50,000 by forging a client's will. In court, the bookmaker said he had agreed to the girl's request and had planned to tell her he couldn't spare any more of his time. Currier will be sentenced at Shrewsbury Crown Court, pictured on March 26 by Recorder Martin Butterworth . Earlier, Sergeant David Wynn Jones told the court: 'When we arrived at a betting shop in Telford in which he worked, Mr Currier said to me 'I know why you are here, is this about me going to Nuneaton?' 'I then arrested him and he clarified ""Is this about the ill-advised trip to Nuneaton?""' One of Mr Hunter's team, who posed on the internet as 'Jodie', had used a photo of a 21-year-old woman for the teenager's picture on the Badoo dating and friendship social network site. Currier also used the site, and in his first message to 'Jodie' he said that she was a 'very pretty girl' and asked if she had time for older guys. He also wrote: 'Ever fancy some older c***?' The reply included the mention that 'Jodie' was only 13, but the internet messages and text messages continued. Mr Hunter featured in the one-hour Channel 4 documentary The Paedophile Hunter last year . It is not the first time Stinson Hunter, a self-styled ‘paedophile hunter’, has hit the headlines. The vigilante, based in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, works with his team to entrap internet perverts – which have included soldiers, teachers and solicitors – by posing as underage boys and girls. Mr Hunter, who is in his 30s, featured in the one-hour Channel 4 documentary, The Paedophile Hunter, last year. In it he explained how his team usually pose as boys or girls in their early teens. Once they are sent explicit messages and videos by the men, the team lure them to a house to meet up. There, they are filmed with handheld cameras and mobile phones and told to explain themselves. The messages and footage are then handed to police. The vigilantes usually pose as boys or girls in their early teens. Once they are sent explicit messages and videos by the men, the team lure them to a house to meet up. There, they are filmed with handheld cameras and mobile phones and told to explain themselves. The messages and footage are handed to police. So far, Hunter has filmed confrontations with dozens of men including soldiers, teachers and solicitors and, at the time of the documentary, had seen his evidence help in 10 convictions. Mr Hunter's methods have been both praised and criticised. Stinson's methods came under fire in 2013 after one man who he confronted, 45-year-old Michael Parkes, took his own life. The 45-year-old hanged himself last year after being questioned by police after he was confronted by Stinson Hunter, and footage of the encounter was uploaded to the internet. Northamptonshire Police later said they would have sought to charge Mr Parkes in connection with the incident, in which he arranged to meet someone he thought was a 12-year-old girl. Mr Hunter told the film's Bafta-winning director Dan Reed: 'We set the profile. It’s like a rope and if they choose to put the rope around their neck and hang themselves that’s their choice. 'We’ve not pushed them.' Mr Phillip Beardwell, prosecuting, read out a police interview with Currier. In the interview, Currier said: 'I felt Jodie was a fragile young girl. I did not want to go visit her as I thought it was wholly inappropriate. 'However, the texts were getting more frequent and getting a bit much. 'As she was fragile I did not want to bluntly stop it. She kept going on at me and the texts were coming every seven minutes to see if I had decided. 'I decided I might go over that evening and explain face-to-face I couldn't give her any more of my time. 'I did ask her if she had any sexual experience to find out what I would find. I made it clear I would not be doing anything.'","Martin Currier tried to groom online what he thought was a 13-year-old girl .

"Bankers are set to be awarded £5billion in bonuses, including £2.2billion for staff at scandal-hit HSBC. The vast sum is expected to be paid out to bankers at HSBC despite it being embroiled in a tax dodging row. And Royal Bank of Scotland, bailed out by the taxpayer after the financial crash, is likely to hand its staff £500million in bonuses. Scroll down for video . Bankers are set to be awarded £5billion in bonuses, including nearly £900million for staff at bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds . Lloyds, which was also bailed out by the Government to the tune of nearly £20billion, is expected to pay its bankers £375million in bonuses, the Mirror reported. Meanwhile Barclays is expected to pay its staff around £2billion, taking the estimated total in bonuses at the Big Four banks to almost £5billion, despite the banking industry being mired in scandal. It is claimed that HSBC's Swiss arm helped wealthy customers evade tax, while its Geneva offices were raided earlier this week as part of an 'aggravated money laundering' investigation. John O'Connell, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The cost of the bank bailouts is still hitting the country's finances hard and huge bonuses will just rub salt in the wound. 'The government has got to get the cost of funding these banks off the backs of taxpayers and into the private sector where they belong.' RBS was saved from collapse by taxpayers after a £45billion bail-out kept them afloat in 2008. The Government still owns the majority - 79 per cent - of the bank. HSBC is expected to pay out £2.2billion in bonuses to its staff despite claims the bank helped wealthy customers dodge tax . The vast bonuses, set to be less than the £576million paid out in 2013, could be announced next week when the bank reveals its annual results. Meanwhile Lloyds' bonuses are also expected to be down from last year, falling from £395million. The claims that HSBC's Swiss arm helped thousands of customers dodge tax comes seven years after its former IT worker Herve Falciani fled Geneva with details of thousands of clients suspected of avoiding tax in their home countries, including 6,000 Britons. Files including the names of 30,000 account holders including celebrities, were leaked. They claimed huge sums were channelled through HSBC as customers dodged taxes or laundered proceeds of crime. Last week, a leaked memo revealed that HSBC was willing to help a ‘blood diamond’ trader even though he was being investigated for tax evasion. The term refers to uncut gems smuggled out of Africa and sold to fund brutal civil wars. HSBC said its private banking operation has been overhauled and accounts of suspect clients closed. A spokesman said: ‘We have co-operated continuously with the Swiss authorities since first becoming aware of the data theft in 2008.’ HSBC were willing to help a 'blood diamond' smuggler even though they knew that he was being investigated over tax evasion, according to a leaked memo. The bank aided Emmanuel Shallop before he was convicted for his part in an illegal trade that fuelled war in Africa. According to one memo seen by the Guardian, one banker said: 'The client is currently being very careful because he is under pressure from the Belgian tax authorities who are investigating his activities in the field of diamond tax evasion.' HSBC bankers also helped him open a bank account in Dubai. Blood diamonds were rough, uncut gemstones, smuggled out of Africa and sold to fund civil wars. The main countries involved were Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone, The Democratic Republic of Congo and the Ivory Coast. Emmanuel Shallop used his company Shallop Diamonds to trade conflict diamonds for Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leaders in Sierra Leone.","HSBC bankers to be awarded £2.2bn in bonuses despite tax controversy .

"A new brutally-honest style series set to premiere on TLC this evening will see a group of fashion-challenged individuals being critiqued by a jury of strangers, before being given a much-needed makeover by two style experts. In tonight's debut episode of Style By Jury, which is presented by British fashion expert Louise Roe and American Eagle's Style Director Preston Konrad, a 44-year-old mother-of-one receives a damning appraisal from the show's panel of critics, who are hidden behind a two-way mirror, with one comparing her look to that of a 'homeless person', while another questions whether she has 'stolen her husband's old clothes'. 'I like to be comfortable, I like to be casual,' the show's first 'fashion offender', Sloane, who was nominated to appear on the show by her cousin, tells Louise. 'My size dictates what I wear.' Scroll down for video . Fashion victim: Sloane, 44, is the first person to be critiqued by a brutally-honest hidden style jury . 'I got lazy': The mother-of-one confesses to host Louise Roe that she gave up caring about what she looked like and how she dressed . Dressed in a baggy, oversized orange T-shirt and a pair of distressed, worn jeans, which are riddled with holes, Sloane's less-than-stylish appearance prompts a series of shocked responses from the jury, who are remain hidden - and unheard - behind a concealed mirror. 'She looks dumpy,' one juror says, while another adds: 'She looks like she's getting ready to do some hard labor.' One particularly brutal juror goes as far as to say that Sloane's baggy clothing makes her look as though stolen 'the old stuff that her husband was donating to Goodwill', prompting her colleague to state: 'She looks homeless, that's what I want to say.' Sloane confesses that she has lost any and all motivation to make an effort when it comes to her appearance. 'I don't wear lipstick at all,' she admits. 'I might wear Chapstick, but that's it. 'My holey jeans are my favorite jeans. I can wear those for about everything. Those are my casual jeans, those are my dress-up jeans. I just maybe might try and put a nicer T-shirt on that might be a little bit more fancy.' 'She's ready for hard labor!' A hidden panel of critics assesses Sloane's look and delivered a series of damning verdicts about her appearance . Behind-the-scenes: The jury is hidden behind a two-way mirror, allowing them to make their observations in private, before they are revealed to Sloane . A hole load of problems: Sloane wears this pair of ripped jeans - her favorite pair - for any and all occasions, be they smart or casual . But while Sloane doesn't take much interest in anything to do with fashion or beauty, she confesses that her husband, whom she has been married to for 11 years, and their 11-year-old daughter, have both grown frustrated with her overly laid-back appearance. '[My daughter] is a little embarrassed about [how I dress],' she says, before adding: '[My husband] thinks I'm frumpy. He loves me but... 'I don't go anywhere. I work, I'm a mom. I do stop myself from going out to dinner with my husband, I'll make up excuses not to go out with my girlfriends. 'It might be a lot of times that I'm lazy... I don't find it important, the way I look.' But Louise, 33, is unimpressed with Sloane's excuses. 'You basically implied that you don't need to, and you shouldn't have to, make the effort because you work and you're a mom,' she says. 'So, you must be the only person in the world who works and is also a mom, right?' Family ties: The fashion victim admits that her husband and their 11-year-old daughter (pictured) find her laid-back appearance quite embarassing . Giving evidence: Sloane's cousin Sierra steps forward as a witness and tells Louise exactly why she feels her cousin is in need of a makeover . Then and now: Sierra explains that Sloane was 'absolutely beautiful' as a twenty-something, but that she let herself go following the death of her mother . After delivering her own damning appraisal of Sloane's sense of style, Louise calls her cousin and close friend Sierra to the Style By Jury witness stand in order to present her evidence for why Sloane is so desperately in need of a makeover. 'She is just so beautiful and it just doesn't present itself on the outside,' she explains. 'I know it, I know what's there, but on the outside you would never see it.' Sierra goes on to describe the series of tragic events in Sloane's life which she believes have lead to her becoming so disinterested in her outward appearance - adding that, during her early 20s, Sloane was 'amazing beautiful on the outside'. 'I think that a lot of stuff has happened in her life, one being her mother passing away,' Sierra tells Louise. 'And I think, hoenstly, from that moment on, she hasn't been the same. 'It has shown in the way she dresses, in her appearance.' Showing Louise an image of a glamorous-looking Sloane at age 20, Sierra adds: 'She was amazingly beautiful on the outside [when we were younger]. Everywhere we went, guys were after her.' On the stand: Sierra explains to Louise that she wants her cousin to look as beautiful on the outside as she is on the inside . Surprise! Sloane is shocked to discover that a hidden panel has been assessing her appearance . Baby steps: The first part of her makeover sees Sloane forced to try on a skin-tight body suit so that she can 'learn where her waistline truly is' The black and white image, which shows Sloane posing seductively, while wearing a flattering low-cut top, prompts gasps of shock from the jury - and from Louise, who then reveals to Sloane that a hidden jury has been appraising her look since she walked into the room. She reveals to Sloane exactly what harsh criticism the jurors voiced about her appearance when she first walked into the room, leaving the mother-of-one in tears. 'I'm not too shocked by a lot of what they said,' she tells Louise. 'I want my daughter to be proud of me. I want her to see mommy happy, and like herself and think that she's beautiful.' Sloane is then taken off to begin her makeover process - which starts with Louise and Preston forcing her into a skin-tight body suit, so that she can 'learn where her waistline truly is' and discover which parts of her body she can accentuate with the help of some new clothing. 'This is my kick in the butt,' Sloane tells the camera. 'This is what I need.' After undergoing a series of rigorous style lessons, Sloane, and her brand new look, will then be presented to a new jury, who will give their own verdict on her revitalized appearance.

"Sam Strange, 23, raped a four-year-old boy on Christmas Eve and has been jailed for nine years . A 23-year-old man who raped a four-year-old boy on Christmas Eve when he was drunk has been jailed for nine years after his victim gave evidence holding his teddy bear. Sam Strange, from Folkestone in Kent, had denied three sexual offences but a jury took four hours and 21 minutes to convict him. Sentencing, Judge Heather Norton told him: 'This was an extremely serious offence perpetrated on a vulnerable and defenceless young child.' Strange was also placed on the Sex Offender's Register and made subject to a Sex Offences Prevention Order for life. Canterbury Crown Court heard how Strange had visited the boy's mother on Christmas Eve. Two weeks later, when questioned by his mother, the boy told what Strange had done to him. The 23-year-old was arrested on January 27 and later charged. The boy, who is now five, gave evidence at the case while clutching his teddy bear becoming one of the youngest to give evidence at a crown court. Wearing a blue hoodie, he sat in a special room next to an intermediary – a language specialist – and a member of the witness support team. Judge Heather Norton and two barristers went to meet the child just minutes before he gave his evidence via a special CCTV link to the courtroom. Judge Heather Norton and counsel removed their wigs while the boy gave evidence, because he had a 'particular hatred of wigs', the judge said. In an earlier video made by police and shown to the court, the child said he had been sexually assaulted by Strange. Prosecutor Eloise Marshall said the attacks were revealed when the child pointed to a doll to show where he had been assaulted by Strange. After the video with the allegations was played to the jury, the child was asked questions by the barrister representing Strange, Stephen Earnshaw. Sam Strange, from Folkestone in Kent, had denied three sexual offences but a jury took four hours and 21 minutes to convict him by a majority of 10:2 at Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) The judge told the jury: 'Mr Earnshaw won't be asking many questions and among the things he won't be asking is putting to the child that he is lying or anything like that which he might ask an adult witness.' He then answered questions from Mr Earnshaw who asked him five things and received mainly one word answers. Once he had finished the boy was thanked by the judge and told he could go home. Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Matthew Jones said: 'This was a very serious offence on a vulnerable young person. 'Strange refused to admit what he had done, which meant putting the boy through the ordeal of giving evidence in court, which I commend him for. 'I hope now, he can put this behind him and continue to live a life like any other child would.'","Sam Strange, 23, from Folkestone, raped four-year-old on Christmas Eve .

"Colorado already is being sued by two neighboring states for legalizing marijuana. Now, the state faces groundbreaking lawsuits from its own residents, who are asking a federal judge to order the new recreational industry to close. The owners of a mountain hotel and a southern Colorado horse farm argue in a pair of lawsuits filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Denver that the 2012 marijuana-legalization measure has hurt their property and that the marijuana industry is stinky and attracts unsavory visitors. The lawsuits are the first in a state that has legalized recreational or medical marijuana in which its own residents are appealing to the federal government to block pot laws. Mason Tvert, spokesperson for the Council on Responsible Cannabis Regulation, announces that a federal lawsuit is being filed on behalf of two Colorado citizens by a D.C.-based group to shut down the state's $800-million-a-year marijuana industry . What are they on? The lawsuits are the first in any state that has legalized recreational or medical marijuana in which its own residents are appealing to the federal government to block pot laws . 'It is a bedrock principle of the United States Constitution that federal law is the supreme law of the land,' said David Thompson, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs. The lawsuits are also the first to claim that federal racketeering laws allow them to win damages from pot businesses that flout federal law. The plaintiffs have not specified amounts they would seek. Experts say the racketeering approach is a new one. 'If these lawsuits are successful, it could be devastating for the industry,' said Sam Kamin, a University of Denver law professor who helped craft Colorado's pot regulations. 'But it will be very difficult for the plaintiffs to prove damages directly attributable to the marijuana industry.' Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman released a statement saying she would 'defend the state's marijuana laws and our clients' if the lawsuits go to trial. Marijuana legalization supporters say that states are free to stop enforcing certain drug laws, as long as they don't try to overrule the federal Controlled Substances Act. Smoked out: The lawsuit is being sponsored by a group called the Safe Streets Alliance, which is based in the nation's capital and opposes marijuana legalization . 'Colorado has every right to stop punishing adults for using marijuana,' said Mason Tvert, who ran Colorado's legalization campaign and joined about a dozen other legalization supporters who marched to the state Capitol on Thursday. They carried signs saying, 'Regulation Works!' One legalization backer, Democratic state Rep. Jonathan Singer, said the pot industry has boosted tax coffers and hurt the black market. 'The sky hasn't fallen. We're doing the right thing,' Singer said. Technically, federal law making pot illegal for any purpose remains in effect in the 23 states that have authorized its use for people with certain medical conditions. However, it's not clear how far the federal government can go to compel states to enforce drug laws. For nearly 20 years, the U.S. Department of Justice has said that marijuana is illegal and that the federal government can enforce even small-possession crimes. However, U.S. authorities have left most enforcement to the states, saying they focus on larger drug crimes. One of the lawsuits came from the owner of a Pueblo County horse farm, Hope Reilly, who said Thursday that she's 'been horrified' to see a marijuana cultivation facility go up next door. 'This land means a great deal to me,' said Reilly, who says the pot facility mars 'spectacular views' of the Rocky Mountains. Unhappy: In December, Colorado's marijuana laws were challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court by the neighboring states of Nebraska and Oklahoma, which say marijuana sold in Colorado has been smuggled across state lines . Also suing is the owner of a Holiday Inn, who argues that a pot shop opening nearby is keeping away families. 'Marijuana businesses make bad neighbors,' the lawsuit says. 'They drive away legitimate businesses' customers, emit pungent, foul odors, attract undesirable visitors, increase criminal activity, increase traffic, and reduce property values.' The owner of the pot shop being sued by the hotel said Thursday he had no idea his neighbor even opposed his license. He said the hotel owner did not appear at public zoning hearings. 'It's kind of silly,' said Jerry Olson, owner of Summit Marijuana, which hasn't yet opened. Nebraska and Oklahoma also are suing Colorado for legalizing marijuana in 2012. Nine former heads of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration filed a brief Thursday with the U.S. Supreme Court supporting the two states. Colorado's pot law 'impinges on the interests of all citizens and the United States in a uniform and coherent national drug policy,' the brief says.","State residents who say legalized pot violates federal racketeering laws, hurts business and diminishes property values .

Manic: Once back down the hill, they were met with a wildlife officer and AMT who quickly transported Kemp to an open field to be flown to OU Medical. His leg was later amputated . No laughing matter: After being bitten Kemp said he became nauseated, his leg swelled and his heart began to pound. He thought he might not survive . The three men had just completed a tough week of testing and wanted to get out and enjoy the terrain in the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge, a 59,000-acre expanse adjacent to Fort Sill and maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Kemp, who was training to be an artillery officer heard a noise in the brush, and then within an instant, searing pain as the snake pushed its fangs into his leg. His fellow Marines rushed to his aid, one helping him to stand while the other dialed 911. Their only way out was on foot, walking across the top of a nearby dam to avoid another descent into the steep valley. Kemp credits his two friends, also second lieutenants, for saving his life as they helped get him to a hospital. 'One of the last things I remember is as soon as the sheriff laid me down, I looked at my buddy and told him to text my mom and tell her I love her,' Kemp said to NewsOk. 'My friends were very comforting the entire time,' Kemp said. 'If it wasn't for them, I definitely would have been dead.' 'I'm good. A little lighter, but I'm good,' he said in a phonecall to NBC News from OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City. 'I'm trying my best to stay positive about the entire thing.' The snake bike went deep beneath skin filling Kemp's lower leg with venom. 2nd Lt. Taylor Quackenbush and 2nd Lt. Matthew Holliday helped on the day of the accident and have continued to visit him during his recovery. Training day: The day started out as a day of celebration for Kemp and his buddies, Matthew Holliday and Taylor Quackenbush, part of a small class of Marines training at Fort Sill to become artillery officers . The rescuers: 2nd Lieutenant Taylor Quackenbush (right) and 2nd Lieutenant Matthew Holliday (left) said they were just hiking up a hill at the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge when their friend was bitten . Attacker: They estimated the snake to be between six and eight feet long. 2nd Lieutenant Quackenbush called 911 while 2nd Lieutenant Holliday tried to help Kemp walk nearly 25 minutes back down the hill . Looking out: His buddies have visited him since the incident and in between his surgeries. They say his is still his normal self . Close call: Venomous snakebites are deadly because the poison eats up blood platelets; clots will not form. A snakebite victim risks internal bleeding that can lead to death . The poison damaged the flesh so much that doctors had to amputate his leg above the knee. He also received 32 doses of antivenin, an antidote to the snake venom. Venomous snakebites are deadly because the poison eats up blood platelets; clots will not form. A snakebite victim risks internal bleeding that can lead to death. Swelling also can interfere with blood supply to a limb, sometimes necessitating amputations, Schaeffer said. Several weeks on from the traumatic incident, Kemp, who is from Glen Cove on Long Island, is now in stable condition and only recently emerged from a days-long haze. It's a long road to recovery however. After leaving hospital he will begin rehabilitation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He is hoping that the loss of his leg does not mean the loss of his career. 'I'm not getting out just yet,' Kemp said. 'We'll see about career options and stuff. I'll take it one day at a time.' 'I was, again, very fortunate my friends were there and were able to not only keep me moving, kind of keep my head in the game,' Kemp said. 'They very much saved my life.' Friends turned heroes: Marine Anthony Kemp is shown during his tour of dut (left). He credits his two Marine buddies with saving his life . Well liked: Kemp is still due for a few more surgeries. One of the Facebook pages 'Cards for Kemp' is asking people to send cards to him as he goes through this journey . Saved: The Marines say their training of thinking fast and staying calm kicked in .","Second Lt.

"More than a dozen diners enjoying a late breakfast at the trendy Balthazar Cafe in Soho were struck by a giant 10-foot mirror that fell off a wall. One person, later identified as former French Minister Arnaud Montebourg, was taken to Bellevue Hospital suffering from minor injuries. The socialist politician, who left his post last year, was in the US on an anti-austerity speaking tour when he was injured. The incident took place just after 10am at restaurateur Keith McNally’s popular French brasserie, which for years has been drawing a steady stream of celebrity patrons, including David and Victoria Beckham, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, Jimmy Fallon and many others. Scroll down for video . Mirror, mirror off the wall: A giant decorative mirror fell off a wall at Balthazar Cafe in SoHo, striking a group of diners having late breakfast .

It is possible to make out in the back an empty space on the wall where the hulking mirror had hung . A photo taken by diner Liz Eswein showed a wall-sized, 10-by-15 foot mirror laying across several tables in the middle of the dining room. In a tweet sent after the incident, Eswein praised the FDNY for arriving to the scene within moments. The eyewitness said the injured patron looked like a tourist. According to FDNY, he sustained non-life-threatening injuries. French press has identified the victim as 52-year-old Arnaud Montebourg, a Sorbonne-educated left-wing French politician who served for two years as Minister of Industrial Renewal. Montebourg, a father of two, was spotted holding a napkin to a bleeding head wound, DNAInfo reported. Despite his injury, the liberal French politician lended a helping hand to his fellow diners, lifting the hulking mirror like 'superman,' as some witnesses have put it to the New York Post. The paper quoted Balthazar patrons as saying that the 52-year-old foreign national unleashed a torrent of swear words, but otherwise seemed nonplussed. The French publication Paris Match reported that Montebourg was having breakfast with his girlfriend, French Minister of Culture and Communication Aurelie Filippetti, when the accident occurred.

The caption read that the 52-year-old anti-austerity crusader was 'okay' after being discharged. Montebourg was in town after traveling to Princeton University the day before to meet up with Nobel laureate and New York Times opinion columnist Paul Krugman. He posted a photo on his Twitter page Thursday showing the two men shaking hands. The image was accompanied by a caption in French, which in translation read: 'At Princeton, have thanked the Nobel Paul Krugman for his fight against suicidal austerity led by the gvt of EU.' Montebourg was scheduled to give a talk at Princeton Monday evening. The French-language edition of The Huffington Post reported that the lecture will go on as planned. Balthazar patron William Chervit told Gothamist that when he saw the enormous mirror crash onto diners at an adjacent table, he was certain that somebody was dead. About 15 people rushed over to the stricken table and attempted to lift the behemoth mirror, but it proved too heavy at first. Since opening its doors in 1997, Balthazar has become a popular dining spot for celebrities and visiting dignitaries of every stripe, including Sofia Lauren, Jimmy Fallon, Katie Holmes and Julienne Moore, to name just a few. David and Victoria Beckham are frequent guests at the eatery.

"An artist has been banned by Facebook from posting images of her scientific-based work  as they were deemed 'overly sexual'. Rebecca Harris had created a hand-stitched piece of art depicting the human body with its microbes for an exhibition titled Invisible You: The Human Microbiome for the Eden Project. But she was stunned to be told she could not show pictures of her work on her Facebook page as the social network did not allow 'overly sexual images' that 'suggest nudity' and 'show a lot of skin or cleavage.' Professional artist Rebecca Harris was shocked after she tried to post images of her artwork on Facebook, only to be told they breached the social network's guidelines for being 'overly sexual' Rebecca, 37, from Launceston, Cornwall had been commissioned for the project in August last year and started work a month later. The mother-of-three attempted to set up an advert on Facebook to promote her work but this was rejected for breaching its guidelines. A message from 'Jane' of the Facebook ads team read: 'Your ad was rejected because the image doesn't follow our ad guidelines. Ads may not use overly sexual images, suggest nudity, show a lot of skin or cleavage, or focus unnecessarily on specific body parts. This is also applicable to the images present on your pages. 'Please make the necessary edits and recreate your posts. If it's an ad created from the create flow, you can edit it in your ads manager.' Rebecca, who is a professional artist and has three children Nicole, 17, Zoe, 15, and Brae, 6, said she was staggered by the response. She said: 'Needless to say I was shocked by Facebook's comments and sat looking confused at the screen for some time. 'Then I decided I must make this public, so I shared the offending image via Twitter and it soon got many, many re-tweets as others obviously agreed at how absurd this was. Rebecca had created the hand-stitched piece of art depicting the human body with its microbes for an exhibition titled Invisible You: The Human Microbiome for the Eden Project . 'So what started as a day where Facebook would not give me any exposure to up my 'likes' to a round figure of 500 turned out to be the best exposure the work has received so far and I haven't given them a penny. 'It was merely meant to be a post to promote the page in general. I initially got a generic computer response describing it as a sexual, which I thought was quite funny at first. It was so ridiculous so I appealed and thought as soon as a human being saw the advert they would allow it go ahead. 'That was when I got the e-mail from Jane from Facebook ads, who described it as overly sexual. 'I just find the whole thing bizarre that you see some horrific things on facebook yet something like this can be censored. 'We have had the last laugh though and my work has now got more publicity than I could ever have imagined.' The artwork 'stitching science' will play a major part in the Invisible You: The Human Microbiome exhibition at The Eden Project in May. A spokesman for the project said: 'Invisible You: The Human Microbiome... showcases the fascinating world of the beneficial microbes that live in and on our bodies. The work is an embroidered textile hanging that represents the microbial communities of the skin and illustrates that the womb does not contain a microbial community. 'We are pleased that Rebecca's striking, thought-provoking work is due to be part of Invisible You exhibition and we're glad that it is sparking debate already.'

"A Michigan man diagnosed with stage four liver cancer has been granted a dying wish to marry his fiancee, after doctors said it was unlikely he would survive the next week. Daniel Robertson, 63, of Port Huron, only discovered he had cancer in early January, when doctors told him he had between three and six months to live. He and his fiancee, Leeanna, 46, who he met online in 2009, quickly started planning a wedding - setting a date for February 27. But as Robertson's health took a sharp decline, making him reliant on a wheelchair, doctors said it was unlikely he would make it to next Friday. Dying wish: Doctors say Daniel Robertson, who is battling liver cancer, now has only days to live. On Wednesday he married his fiancee Leeanna in the Marysville hospice that is caring for him . Overjoyed: For Leeanna Robertson, the occasion was bittersweet, knowing she will soon have to say goodbye to her husband . Big day: Nurses at Blue Water Hospice Home managed to pull the wedding together in 24 hours . Celebration: Staff managed to get the cake, flowers and a hair stylist donated by local businesses . Staff at Blue Water Hospice Home in Marysville quickly stepped in, and were able to bring the nuptials forward in just 24 hours. 'We take care of the whole patient here,' Robertson's nurse, Jean Flint, told The Detroit Free Press. 'One of his goals in life was to get married, so we wanted to make that happen.' Luckily, Leeanna already had the wedding dress, so the nurses organized for a cake and flowers to be donated, and brought in a hair stylist from a local salon. The St. Clair County clerk also waived the three-day waiting period required when applying for a marriage license. The couple were married on Wednesday. 'While I was excited to finally be marrying him, I was heartbroken,' the bride told The Detroit Free Press. Bridesmaid: The bride is seen here with her 26-year-old daughter, Angel Maushund . Congratulations: The couple said their dream was to marry each other - and on Wednesday they finally did . 'As I walked down the aisle I just thought he still looked so good and I was so happy to see him standing.' While Robertson has lost alot of his strength and is having trouble breathing, he was in great spirits for the big day. 'I'm feeling fantastic today,' he said. 'As she walked down the aisle I was thinking, ''What took her so darn long to get ready?'' 'She had me waiting at the altar for her.' For his now-wife, it was bittersweet - finally getting married, but knowing she is about to lose her husband just as quickly. 'I have finally married my true love and my soul mate,' Leeanna said. 'We wanted to do nothing else but get married.'","Daniel Robertson, 63, of Port Huron, Michigan, diagnosed in January .

"Whether it's a cheeky monkey or a winking smiley, emojis have become a universal language to express how we're feeling. But one designer claims that these characters fail to convey the emotions felt by introverts, such as the need to sneak off from a party, or to spend time reading. Now, California-based artist Rebecca Evie Lynch has changed this by creating more than 30 'introjis' that include activities typically associated with time spent alone. The 'Introjis', created by California-based artist Rebecca Evie Lynch, are designed to help introverts let loved ones know that they need their own space without providing a reason or excuse. Activities shown here include leaving a party without telling anyone, listening to music, reading and recharging . 'My boyfriend of three years broke up with me, citing the need for more time alone,' she told Fastcocreate.com. 'I was surprised, as I've always considered myself an introvert, too, but I realised that my enthusiasm about being in a relationship sometimes overshadows my ability to read others' signals.' Determined to create a better communication system for introverts, Ms Lynch came up with the concept of 'Introji'. She says this visual language helps let loved ones know 'that you need more time and space' without having to provide a reason. The series of introjis also have characters that represent distress calls, in order for introverts to express when they are depressed or need company. The left image shows someone drowing. In the centre is a introji to show someone is recharging while the right image depicts 'giving you space' The left image shows a hangover, the centre image depicts spending time together relaxing, while the right image shows anxiety . Here characters convey activities such as reading, gaming, leaving stressful social situations and sneaking off from a party. 'Introverts tend to find the company of others draining,' explains Ms Lynch. 'But communication isn't a one-way street. In the series, Ms Lynch designed certain icons with red backgrounds to indicate that the user doesn't want company at the moment. Meanwhile, images with blue and green backgrounds express that company is welcome. The series of introjis also have characters that represent distress calls, in order for introverts to express when they are depressed or need company. Ms Lynch is now hoping to transform her concept designs into a free app. She has created a Facebook page to get suggestions from introverts on new designs. People who use emojis in text messages have more sex than those who don't, according to Match.com's annual dating survey. The Singles in America study polled more than 5,600 single people of all ages, ethnicities, incomes and walks of life; and found that emoji users were more likely to report having sex at least monthly than non-emoji users. The 'wink' is the most widely used emoji overall, but when you separate men and women, men are more likely to pepper their texts with 'kiss' and 'heart eyes' emojis, while women prefer 'smileys'. According to biological anthropologist Dr Helen Fisher, who helped lead the study, emojis are popular simply because they help us communicate more effectively in a medium in which sentiments can otherwise fall flat. 'Technology is dramatically changing how we court, but it can’t change the brain systems for romance', she writes for Match.com. Around 50 per cent of men and women agree that emojis 'show personality' and around 35 per cent of both sexes say they make 'expressing feelings' easier. Just don't spell your feelings wrong. The study also found that 54 per cent of single women and 36 per cent of men find misspellings and incorrect grammar to be the biggest text message turn-offs. The eyes have it: The 'wink' is the most widely used emoji overall, but when you separate men and women, men are more likely to pepper their texts with 'kiss' and 'heart eyes' emojis, while women prefer 'smileys'","'Introjis' were created by designer Rebecca Evie Lynch after a break up .

"Two convicted murderers serving life sentences are to tie the knot in Britain’s first gay wedding in prison, it has emerged. Mikhail Ivan Gallatinov, 40, who was jailed in 1997 for what a judge labelled a ‘callous, chilling killing’, is to marry fellow prisoner Marc Goodwin. Goodwin, 31, was the leader of a gang that roamed the streets of Blackpool looking for homosexuals to attack. Mikhail Ivan Gallatinov, 40 (right), who was jailed in 1997 for strangling a 28-year-old gay man, is set to marry Marc Goodwin, 31, (left) who was jailed for life in 2007 after being found guilty of murdering a 57-year-old man . He was jailed for life with a minimum of 18 years in 2007 after being found guilty of murdering Malcolm Benfold, 57, who was beaten to death. His trial heard that he and two friends had agreed to go ‘gay bashing’. Goodwin and Gallatinov – who strangled 28-year-old gay man Adrian Kaminsky – met while behind bars, according to the Daily Mirror. They have been given official permission for the ceremony at HMP Full Sutton, Yorkshire. No details of the wedding have been revealed, although a notice of the marriage has reportedly been posted at the register office in the nearest town, Beverley. On the notice, both men give their occupation as bar staff. A Ministry of Justice spokesman commented: ‘Prisoners are entitled to apply to be married in prison under the Marriages Act 1983. 'This would take place at no cost to the taxpayer and there is no possibility that they would share a cell.’ It is believed that the couple had considered a civil partnership until a change in the law in March last year made homosexual marriage legal in Britain. A string of notorious inmates have tied the knot behind bars, including the East End gangster Reggie Kray who married Roberta Jones, then 38, at Maidstone Prison in Kent in 1997. At the time, Kray was serving a life sentence for the murder of another gangland figure, Jack ‘The Hat’ McVitie. The pair have been given official permission to marry in a ceremony at HMP Full Sutton, Yorkshire (pictured) The convicted murderers will wed at HMP Full Sutton, Yorkshire (pictured) and it will be the first gay wedding in a British prison. The Ministry of Justice said the pair would not be able to share a cell after the ceremony . And Mickey McAvoy, who was sentenced to 25 years for his part in the 1983 Brink’s-Mat gold bullion robbery, married his second wife Kathy in the gym of HMP Leicester three years after his crime. Gallatinov, of Manchester, who previously served a prison sentence for sexually abusing children, was jailed for a minimum of 20 years for the murder of Mr Kaminsky – meaning he could be eligible for parole in two years. He spoke to his victim on a gay chat line before luring him to his home. At the time of his sentencing, Judge Rhys Davies QC said the murder was ‘a cold-blooded, well planned, callous, chilling and apparently motiveless killing’. He added: ‘You are a dangerous young man and you present a considerable risk to the public. The defendant acted without pity, concern or remorse. ‘He was described by one of the psychiatrists as a dangerous man. He does not suffer from mental illness but is wholly devoid of moral judgment,’ he added. East End gangster Reggie Kray (left) married Roberta Jones, then 38 (right), at Maidstone Prison in 1997 . The case was particularly shocking because Gallatinov was under police surveillance at the time and had actually told an undercover detective that he intended to commit murder. Officers were positioned outside his house at the time of the killing and he photographed his victim with a camera that he had been lent by detectives. Mr Kaminsky’s body was later found nearly naked in the boot of Gallatinov’s car after he was stopped on a motorway. Goodwin, originally of Airdrie, near Glasgow, is expected to serve at least another ten years behind bars. He has been visited by his victim’s sister, Wendy Bridge, to whom he expressed remorse. She recalled: ‘He said he was really sorry and wished there was still the death penalty as he would be dead too.’","Mikhail Ivan Gallatinov, 40, set to marry fellow prisoner Marc Goodwin, 31 .

Third time: March's four-day trip is the third time that the royal pair will have visited as a couple . First trip: Their first overseas trip following their 2005 wedding was to the United States . Meeting: This trip will see Charles and Camilla meet President Obama in the Oval Office . Along with meeting President Obama and marking US anniversaries, Charles will celebrate a very British one during a trip to the National Archives in the American capital. While visiting Washington D.C, he will be shown a rare 1297 copy of the Magna Carta, made 82 years after the original was signed by King John at Runnymede. The first Magna Carta, which celebrates its 800th birthday this year, is considered the foundation of British democracy and represents the first time any monarch had limitations placed on their powers. Under its terms, the monarch was bound to protect the rights of the church and the barons, deliver swift justice and limit the amount he or she could demand in taxes. Rewritten and reissued a further three times, the 1297 version was proclaimed by Edward I, the famous Hammer of the Scots, who did so in exchange for extra tax-raising powers. The declaration, made to provide funds for Edward's conquest of Scotland and Wales, remains part of British law today, with the 1297 charter still on the statute books. Meeting: During their 2005 trip, the couple met then President George W. Bush and his wife Laura . Whirlwind: That trip also included a visit to San Francisco where Charles met the California Highway Patrol . Back to Britain: The tour was considered a success, with US Press describing them as being 'down-to-earth' But the four-day visit isn't entirely about historical anniversaries, with Clarence House saying in a statement that the focus will also be on 'sustainability and climate change, creating youth opportunities, encouraging corporate social responsibility and promoting cultural links'. The trip will begin in Louisville, the birthplace of boxer Muhammad Ali, where the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will meet local people and visit a series of community projects. Next on the itinerary is Washington D.C, where the royal couple will visit the Armed Forces Retirement Home, which occupies same grounds as the Lincoln Cottage. President Lincoln is believed to have written the final draft of the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, which universally freed all American slaves, while living there. The Retirement Home, the US equivalent of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, is the oldest home for veterans in the US and has occupied the site since 1851. During their tour, the royal couple, both of whom hold honorary military titles, will meet veterans from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coastguard. Last trip: The most recent royal visitors to the US are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Controversial: Their visit included the moment when basketball player LeBron James hugged the Duchess . Glamorous: The visit included a trip to the Northside Center (left) and a lavish gala dinner (right) Another historical stop on the tour is at Mount Vernon, which was the home of George Washington, who presided over the convention that drafted the US Constitution. The timber-framed house, in Fairfax County, Virginia, is perched on the Potomac River and has been in the Washington family since 1674. Contemporary issues will also get an airing, not least when Charles makes an appearance at the International Conservation Caucus Foundation, during which he is to be honoured with an award. While Charles gets to grips with one of his favourite causes at the ICCF, the Duchess of Cornwall will be meeting rape and sexual assault victims in Washington. The Duchess, who is passionate about improving the lot of sexual abuse survivors, will join an meeting of the District of Columbia’s Sexual Assault Response Team. On their final day, the couple will return to Louisville, where Prince Charles will make the keynote address at a symposium on health. Return trip: A year after his infamous visit to Las Vegas, Prince Harry was back in the US and in Colorado . Inspiration: During the visit, he attended the Warrior Games which inspired the Invictus Games a year later . Getting involved: True to form,  Harry also took part in a human pyramid with UK and US military officials . Meanwhile, Camilla will visit a food literacy project for young people at a local farm, which aims to give youngsters the chance to experience farm life and better understand the connection between food and farming. The US has a long history of receiving royal visitors, beginning in 1939 when George VI and the Queen Mother met President Franklin Roosevelt at the White House. Next to visit was the Queen, who made her first trip in 1957 and used it to visit Washington and New York, with a brief stop to take in an American football game between Maryland and North Carolina. Charles made his first official visit in 1985 when, with then-wife Princess Diana, he joined President Ronald Regan and a cast of A-listers for a gala dinner at the White House. More recent visits include the Cambridge's trip to New York last month and to LA in July 2011, as well as Prince Harry's infamous trip to Las Vegas in August 2012. Harry returned to the US the following year, this time for an incident-free trip marked by his attendance at the Warrior Games.","The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are to visit the US .

"Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has hit back at accusations of racism after he said the president doesn't love America by claiming that he was talking about Obama's upbringing by his white mother. Speaking at a New York fund-raising event on Wednesday night, Giuliani has caused uproar among Democrats after criticizing the way the president speaks about his country. 'I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America,' Giuliani said at the event. Scroll down for more . Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani  caused uproar among Democrats after he said on Wednesday night that the president doesn't love his country. 'He was brought up the way you were brought up,' he said . 'He doesn't love you. And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up, through love of this country.' Democrats on Thursday urged the potential field of Republican presidential candidates to rebuke Giuliani's comments. Deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said it was ‘a horrible thing to say’, while Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said it was the time for Republican leaders to 'stop this nonsense.' But speaking to the New York Times, Giuliani stood by his remarks and claimed he was attacking the president's socialist principals. 'Some people thought it was racist -- I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother, a white grandfather, went to white schools, and most of this he learned from white people,' Giuliani said. 'This isn’t racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism.' Speaking to the New York Times, Giuliani said his remarks weren't racist because the president had been raised by his white mother, pictured above . The questioning of Obama's patriotism brought to mind a familiar conservative criticism during his 2008 and 2012 campaigns that he hasn't been proud enough of the United States. During his presidency, a smaller segment falsely claimed that Obama was not born in the United States but rather in his father's native Kenya. Wednesday night's private dinner was attended by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is considering a 2016 campaign. Giuliani said that 'with all our flaws we're the most exceptional country in the world. I'm looking for a presidential candidate who can express that, do that and carry it out.' 'And if it's you Scott, I'll endorse you,' Giuliani said, addressing Walker. 'And if it's somebody else, I'll support somebody else.' Walker, asked about the comments in an interview with CNBC, did not directly address whether he agreed with the former mayor. Wednesday night's private dinner was a fundraiser for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker who refused to condemn Giuliani . 'The mayor can speak for himself. I'm not going to comment on whether — what the president thinks or not. He can speak for himself as well,' Walker said. 'I'll tell you, I love America, and I think there are plenty of people, Democrat, Republican, independent, everywhere in between, who love this country.' Asked about Obama in an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Giuliani said he wasn't 'questioning his patriotism. He's a patriot, I'm sure. 'What I'm saying is, in his rhetoric, I very rarely hear him say the things that I used to hear Ronald Reagan say, the things that I used to hear Bill Clinton say, about how much he loves America.' A spokesman for Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul declined comment and a spokeswoman for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush had no immediate response. Both are potential Republican presidential candidates. Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman, said she often disagreed with former President George W. Bush and Republicans in Congress but never questioned their patriotism. She noted that Arizona Sen. John McCain, during his 2008 presidential campaign, urged fellow Republicans not to question Obama's love of country. 'I would challenge my Republican colleagues and anyone in the Republican party to say, 'Enough.' They need to start leading,' Wasserman Schultz said.","Giuliani caused uproar among Democrats after criticizing the way the president speaks about his country.

"The mother of a Texas middle school student wants an apology after an administrator colored on her son's head with a dark marker because they claim he had a 'gang-related' haircut. Monica Esquivel's son Kobi was attending Coronado Middle School in Plainview with a haircut featuring a line shaved on the side of his head for the last five months. An assistant principal told Kobi his hair was a 'distraction' and colored in the line with a marker earlier this week. Scroll down for video . Kobi shows where an assistant principal at Coronado Middle School in Plainview, Texas, colored on his head . The line that was shaved in Kobi's dark hair (above) was supposed to look like it was a part . Monica Esquivel wants the Plainview Indepedent School District to apologize for what happened with Kobi . Officials from the Plainview Independent School District failed to notify Esquivel about what had happened with her son, KCBD reported. When she did speak to them, school administrators informed her Kobi's haircut could be considered gang related. She said: 'My son is not in a gang, he's not trying to be in a gang. He dresses in khakis, a shirt, not in loose pants or anything, just real nice and casual. 'He isn't representing a gang or anything.' The school district's dress code policy 'prohibits designs shaved into the scalp and this includes lines' The school district's executive director for administrative services, Greg Brown, said any concerns regarding the assistant principal's behavior will be addressed confidentially, according to the Plainview Daily Herald. Brown said district policy 'prohibits designs shaved into the scalp and this includes lines'. He added: 'The dress code is a part of the parent/student handbook that is made available to all students online and in paper form. 'The dress code is specifically looked at by the administration who makes any changes that need to be made.' Final approval about the handbook is usually issued in July. Esquivel wants the Plainview Indepedent School District to apologize to her son and also update its dress code policy. Kobi will be allowed to grow his hair out to cover the shaved line. This situation is similar to one that happened about a year ago in Florida. Last January, a school counselor at Harns Marsh Middle School in Lehigh Acres shaved a student's head because he felt the 11-year-old's hair was a distraction and could be gang related, NBC 2 reported.","Monica Esquivel claims her son Kobi had the same haircut for five months .

"She may once have dreamed of San Pedro, but nowadays Madonna's heart is set on the vibrant city of Tel Aviv - as, it seems, is Natalie Portman's. The stars have been wowed by a new uber-modern development, Meier-on-Rothschild Tower, in Israel, which features glass walls and panoramic sea views.

As a follower of Kabbalah,  Madonna (also known as Esther) has a spiritual link to Israel, so it's no surprise she's looking for a holiday home on its sandy shores. Back in 2012 she chose Tel Aviv to kick off her world tour and has repeatedly declared in concert that she's 'in love with Israel'. She's even hobnobbed with the Israeli politicians and reportedly impressed international statesman Shimon Peres when she started speaking to him in Hebrew. According to a source close to the project,  Israeli-born Natalie Portman has registered her interest too. Oscar-winning Portman moved to America from Israel at the age of three, but two decades later after graduating from Harvard, she returned to her country of birth for a stint at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.

"An Ohio schoolgirl was ordered to cover up her arms at a Valentine's Day dance - because teachers deemed them to be 'sexual objects'. Seventh grader Ari Waters had picked out a pretty yellow  dress for a Valentine's Day dance at Mt. Orab Middle School, believing it to be elegant. But she was left mortified when a male teacher approached her at the dance to ask her to cover up her arms. When her horrified mother Gina demanded to know why exactly her young daughter had been asked to put a coat on, she was told by the vice principal it was because her arms were 'sexual objects'. Anger: Ari Waters was told to cover up after arriving at a dance in this dress - because it showed her arms . Shock: Ari's mother Gina was horrified to discover her daughter had been asked to cover up because her arms were considered to be 'sexual objects' - although the school denies this was ever said . Not alone: Three to six other children were asked to cover up by teachers from the middle school, pictured . Ms Waters has since spoken out against the school - deeming teachers' behaviour towards her young daughter entirely inappropriate. 'These middle schoolers are 10 years of age up to 13,' she told Local12. 'They're kids. They're not sexual beings. That word should never have been used and it should never have been associated with an arm, with a limb.' It was later revealed Ari was one of three to six students at the school asked to cover their 'sleeveless attire'. The youngster witnessed at least one other girl being asked to cover up her arms because she was in a spaghetti-strap dress. Ari, meanwhile, has said she has been left feeling 'dirty' - and was so embarrassed on the night she called her mother to pick her up. Upset: Ms Waters was so cross about the incident, she has spoken out publicly on her daughter's behalf . Embarrassed: Ari says she was left feeling 'dirty' - and asked her mother to pick her up early . Dress code: A statement from the school also said the dress code (pictured) was made clear before the dance . But Mt. Orab Middle School has stood by its decision, saying in a statement it has a dress code which students have to abide by at school functions. Headteacher Sabrina Armstrong said the students had been 'explicitly told' they were expected to dress a certain way several weeks before the dance. However, she denies the vice principal called Ari's arms sexual objects. 'The district has looked into the situation and deemed them to be unfounded,' Ms Armstrong said in a statement.","Ari Waters ordered to cover up by male teacher at Mt. Orab Middle School .

"Indonesian authorities have announced that the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran   has been delayed by up to one month. Husain Abdullah, the spokesman for Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, said the execution of the drug smugglers  'will be delayed for between three weeks to a month from now due to technical reasons,' without elaborating further. Jusuf Kalla took a phone call on Thursday afternoon from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who reportedly thanked his government for delaying the men's transfer to the execution site on Kambangan island. Scroll down for video . The executions of Andrew Chan (L) and Myuran Sukumaran who are on death row in Indonesia for drug smuggling have been delayed . Indonesian authorities had already confirmed that Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, would be among the next group of death row prisoners to be executed, despite repeated appeals from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott for their lives to be spared. The two Australians were convicted of smuggling heroin, a crime that carries the death penalty in Indonesia. The news comes after senior government figures expressed concerns Mr Abbott had derailed efforts to save the Bali Nine duo from execution by making comments taken as a 'threat' by Indonesia. Ms Bishop has been leading a carefully crafted campaign to spare the lives of Australians  Sukumaran and Chan, exercising caution in pointing out problems with Indonesia's legal system while remaining respectful, Fairfax reported. But on Wednesday, Mr Abbott linked the men's fate to Australia's donation of $1 billion in aid following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami that killed more than 200,000 in Indonesia, and suggested the Asian country should 'reciprocate in this way at this time'. President of Indonesia Joko Widodo and Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott. The news comes after senior Cabinet members expressed their concern at Mr Abbott's recent comments about the men's executions . The comments sparked a sharp rebuke from the Indonesian government, with the country's foreign affairs ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, hitting back by saying 'no one responds well to threats'. Senior members of the Abbott government slammed the prime minister's comments as 'awful'. 'It undid a lot of the good work,' a source told Fairfax . Sukumaran and Chan were due to be transferred this week from Bali to a high-security prison on Kambangan island ahead of execution, but that was delayed after appeals from Canberra that the men be granted more time with their families. Ahmad Yuspahruddin, chief of the Indonesian Justice Ministry's Central Java penitentiary division which governs the prisons on Kambangan island told Daily Mail Australia today that preparations were in place to put the two Australians to death by firing squad. 'Nothing problem, everything is okay here,' Mr Yuspahruddin said, 'Whenever the Bali nine duo will be coming we have prepared it for some days ago. We are waiting for them.' Indonesian authorities also cited logistical difficulties involving capacity at Nusa Kambangan -- the notorious island prison where five inmates were executed last month -- as a reason for the delay. Chan and Sukumaran are enjoying a few days' reprieve from the firing squad after Indonesia was caught unprepared for the executions and delayed moving them from their Bali jail cells . Senior government figures were concerned Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) had derailed efforts to save the Bali Nine duo, after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's (right) carefully crafted campaign to spare their lives . Tony Spontana, a spokesman for the attorney-general's office which oversees the executions, neither confirmed nor denied the statement from the vice president's office but insisted the prisoners would eventually face the firing squad. 'What needs to be underscored is the execution will still be conducted,' Spontana told AFP. Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo said a date for the transfer had not been set because more co-ordination was needed and he didn't think Mr Kalla would have given a timeframe. 'I've never said that and I don't think the vice president would have said that,' Mr Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta. 'He only leaves it all to us because when a sentence already has final, legally binding status and all legal (appeal) aspects have been fulfilled, the execution is the prosecutor's obligation and responsibility.' At Kerobokan jail on Friday, meetings to plan the transfer to Nusa Kambangan jail continued, but no date was set. 'As soon as Nusa Kambangan is ready, we'll send them immediately,' Bali chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso told reporters. The delay gives Chan and Sukumaran precious days with their families, and precious time for their lawyers to ready their final legal manoeuvres . Gusto Kompiang Adnyana, head of Bali's Law and Human Rights Office, said: 'There's no time for the transfer yet. We haven't co-ordinated with Nusa Kambangan either.' The delay gives Chan and Sukumaran precious days with their families, and precious time for their lawyers to ready their final legal manoeuvres. Indonesia's pledge to proceed with the execution of the Australians -- just two of seven foreigners on death row whose appeals for presidential clemency have been rejected -- has strained ties between Jakarta and Canberra, a relationship only just recovering from a damaging rift in 2014 over spying revelations and people-smuggling. Melbourne barrister Michael O'Connell SC visited the death row Australians in Kerobokan jail on Thursday to go over arrangements for next week's administrative court challenge. They will argue President Joko Widodo did not properly examine their requests for clemency before rejecting them. 'Everything is ready for execution - we are waiting for them': The 'death island' prisons boss Ahmad Yuspahruddin (pictured), chief of the Central Java penitentiary division which governs Nusakambangan Island is prepared to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Mr O'Connell says it's a strong case, but lawyers will first have to clear jurisdictional hurdles - whether Mr Joko's decree can be characterised under administrative law or is simply a decision that's a matter for the president. At the same time, the lawyers' complaints against the original six judges in the Bali Nine pair's trial are being examined. Indonesia's judicial commission has contacted the lawyers for more information about their concerns, which came after the original lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran alleged 'interference' that saw the Australians sentenced to death instead of life for the 2005 drug-smuggling bid. It has been a roller-coaster week for the men, their families and friends at Kerobokan jail. Condemned men: Myuran Sukumaran (pictured in a Bali holding cell) At the start of the week, there were expectations the pair would be moved within days and Sukumaran's family began clearing his art studio of books. Then on Tuesday, it was announced the transfer would not take place this week because isolation cells and the execution site itself were not ready to cater to so many prisoners at once. Mr O'Connell said the Sydney men were coping extremely well. 'They're humbled really by the depth of support that has been coming from Australia and to some extent in Indonesia as well,' he said on Thursday. 'They are very grateful for it and they simple wait and hope.'","Indonesian authorities have delayed the execution of the 'Bali Two'

Rodger used two long fixed-blade knives, including a nearly 9-inch boar hunting knife, to kill roommates James Hong and Weihan 'David' Wang, both 20, and a visiting friend, George Chen, 19. Chen was stabbed 94 times, according to the report. Rodger had been randomly assigned to share the Isla Vista apartment with Hong and Wang. From left, close friends George Chen, David Wang and James Hong were killed by Elliot Rodgers on May 23 in Isla Vista, California . From left, Christopher Martinez, Katherine Cooper and Veronika Weiss were randomly shot dead by Rodger when he went on a killing spree in the summer of 2014 . The families of Hong, Wang and Chen have criticized the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office for not telling them how they believe the killings were carried out, and said they are angered by public health and legal systems that they said value the rights of the mentally ill, including Rodger, over those who may become their victims. 'It's Chinese New Year today and that is the most important day in the Chinese calendar,' said attorney Todd Becker. 'All of our clients are of Chinese descent and it's really an inappropriate day for this information to be released by the Sheriff's Department.' Becker said the families, upon learning of the impending release, had asked sheriff's officials to delay for the holiday. Rodger raced through Isla Vista in his black BMW, engaging deputies in two separate shootouts and leaving a trail of bloodshed that ended with him shooting himself in the head before crashing into a parked car. Inside the car deputies found three semi-automatic handguns with 400 unspent rounds. All were purchased legally. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office released the 64-page report Thursday summarizing the results of their investigation into the May 23 rampage. It reveals he searched online to find ways he could 'silently kill' The rampage happened hours after he looked into a video camera and warned in a disturbing Internet video that he would slaughter those with a good life — especially women who shunned him, leaving him a 22-year-old virgin, authorities said. He also left a 137-page manifesto in which he detailed his life and his disappointments with his family and women. A representative for Rodger's family did not immediately comment on the report's release. Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office deputies were criticized for not searching Elliot Rodger's apartment for weapons during a welfare check weeks prior to the rampage when his parents became concerned about his postings on YouTube. The incident spurred state lawmakers to enact the nation's first law that allows family members to ask a judge to remove firearms from a relative who appears to pose a threat. And lawmakers also bolstered firearm safety and added rules for ammunition sales. The new laws include required law enforcement agencies to develop policies that encourage officers to search the state's database of gun purchases when checking on whether someone may be a danger to themselves or others. Sheriff Bill Brown said in a write-up prefacing the report that the case was very unusual because of the detailed written and video-taped records that indicated he 'clearly suffered from significant mental illness that ultimately resulted in homicidal and suicidal rage.' Brown said he hoped a review of the findings by mental health professionals and the FBI's Behavior Research and Instruction Unit will help develop better practices to ID, intervene and treat such issues.","Elliot Rodger, 22, went on a killing spree in Isla Vista on May 23 .

"Teenagers are usually renowned for spending their parents' money but one 13-year-old from Perth, Scotland, is on a penny-pinching mission to save her family cash. C'Jai Hamilton, 13, describes herself as an 'extreme couponer' as she loves nothing better than bargain hunting to save her friends and family money. The schoolgirl spends two hours a day on her endeavours, trawling websites for the best deals and checking every page of magazines and newspapers for discount coupons. Scroll for video . C'Jai Hamilton, 13, pictured on today's This Morning, describes herself as an 'extreme couponer' The teenager, pictured on the ITV show with her mother, Gail, has saved her parents £1,000 so far . Explaining how money-saving became a hobby, C'Jai said on today's This Morning: 'I kept seeing offers online and I kept looking into it and found it really interested me. I was able to get extra things for me and others which gave me a buzz and I liked helping people.' Thanks to her efforts, C'Jai has saved her parents £1,000 so far as their weekly shopping bills have fallen by a quarter. C'Jai's father suffers from severe arthritis and her mother, Gail, 37, is his full-time carer so the teenager wanted to do something to help them as money was tight. Appearing on the ITV show with her daughter, Gail said: 'Some months we live from week to week. If we can get a bit extra by saving money on the shopping then we can have a treat or a day trip. 'Every week C'Jai isn't just getting coupons for food products but cosmetics and pet products.' C'Jai told Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that bargain hunting is time consuming but worth it . C'Jai, who gives most of the products she gets at a discount to family and friends, said the trick to saving money is all in the research and avoiding impulse buying. She said: 'You have to go on internet, that's big part of it, do online research. Make sure before you buy, it's for you - don't go for an offer if you don't need it as then you could save 20p for something else.' She added: 'Look through every page of a magazine or a newspaper for coupons - don't buy a magazine if it doesn't have any coupons.' The teenager trawls through magazines and websites every day to find money-saving offers . The schoolgirl said the only downside of her bargain hunting is she gets a lot of spam after signing up for discount deals with websites - so she has created an separate email address to the one she uses for social purposes. C'Jai said her hobby - always done after her homework - is time consuming but is is worth it for the rewards. Speaking about her love of couponing on her blog, C'Jai writes: 'If you're American you might think ""this isn't much of a big thing because we do it all the time here"", whereas in the UK it's really not, it's sadly not popular and we don't really get coupons a lot here in magazines or newspapers. 'If you're confused, it's also known as vouchers or money off, I really enjoy doing it and saving my family money, it helps money stretch a wee bit further and sometimes gets you that extra wee treat! 'It's well worth it, it's sometimes easy and hard, I wouldn't say it's a run in the park though... but it's something I really enjoy!' Her mother compared her coupon hunting to a part-time job but said she's happy to encourage it because 'she's gaining skills that she can take into a job in the future.' She added that her daughter is an asset when they go supermarket shopping as she's always looking for the best deals. Gail said: 'Before I buy something she always makes me check if there's a better deal first and always questions if we need it. She says if we don't then it's not worth spending money on it.' To be a savvy shopper, C'Jai recommends looking for the best deals in supermarkets and avoid impulse buys .","C'Jai Hamilton, 13, from Perth, describes herself as an 'extreme couponer'

"Axed: Ronan Farrow's daily news show has been pulled by MSNBC after less than a year . MSNBC have cancelled Ronan Farrow Daily after the show's flailing ratings hit a record-low of just 11,000 viewers earlier this month. However anchor Ronan Farrow is being kept on at the network, and will move into roles during prime-time specials, and work as a correspondent. The 27-year-old journalist - the son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen - sent out an optimistic Tweet about his future at MSNBC on Wednesday, before news broke Thursday that his show had been axed. 'Excited about new role - more to come,' he posted. The network also canceled Joy Reid‘s daytime show The Reid Report, according to Mediaite. Both programs will be replaced by a new two-hour show anchored by Thomas Roberts. The show will run from 1-3pm daily to fill the gap. Politico are reporting that MSNBC hope for their daytime programming to be exclusively 'news-focused'. The schedule also features The Daily Rundown and Andrea Mitchell Reports. Ronan Farrow Daily launched on February 24, 2014, meaning it didn't last a full year on-air. Positive outlook: Farrow Tweeted this sign of optimism on Wednesday night . Incoming and outgoing: MSNBC host Thomas Roberts (left) will brought in to replace Farrow and Joy Reid (right), whose daily show was also canned . Just three days after its launch, Farrow controversially won The Cronkite Award for Excellence in Exploration and Journalism. Many remarked the prestigious award amounted to three hours of airtime. However the Cronkite Foundation said it was based on his work since 2001, including being a UNICEF Spokesperson for Youth. The awards night coincided with further drama, after Woody Allen suggested he wasn't Ronan's biological father and that Frank Sinatra actually was. Things looked more positive in February for Farrow when he won a coveted journalism award . Despite little prior experience, MSNBC had high hopes that Farrow will help them attract millennial viewers, something which hasn't happened so far . Allen wrote that Ronan could have been fathered by Sinatra and claimed that mother Mia Farrow may have been lying about it for decades. The Annie Hall director said Ronan, his only biological child with Farrow, ‘looks a lot like Frank’ thanks to his blue eyes and similar facial features. Allen said that if it were true then Farrow would have kept a dark secret during their bitter custody battle 21 years ago to make him pay child support. Allen’s claims were in response to an article in Vanity Fair magazine in which Farrow said that Sinatra was ‘possibly’ Ronan’s father. Writing in the New York Times, he also for the first time publicly addressed allegations he abused his adopted daughter Dylan and called them ‘ludicrous’. Woody Allen questioned whether Ronan Farrow was his biological son. There is speculation that Frank Sinatra is his real father .","MSNBC have pulled Ronan Farrow Dail days before its one year on-air .

"Nearly 5,000 years after it was created by a Chinese Emperor, tea remains one of the world’s most popular beverages in the US, with tens of thousands of gallons of different iced varieties being consumed every year. But beyond the preferred flavors and serving methods enjoyed in the US, there are huge varieties of other tea-based traditions, flavors and styles being served in different cultures around the world which are far more interesting than what you will find at your local Starbucks. From British tea time to Tibetan Yak Butter Tea, Pulptastic compiled a visual list of teas being served in their native countries. Unique flavor: Moroccan mint tea (pictured) is a variation of green tea made with spearmint leaves and sugar . Super creamy: Hong Kong milk tea (pictured) is black tea that is made with evaporated milk or sweetened condensed milk . According to the Tea Association of the USA, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world next to water. While Americans can choose from varieties of teas, including black, green and white, a majority of the country prefers to drink it chilled. Considering the popularity of sweet tea, particularly below the Mason-Dixon line, it is not at all shocking that the Tea Association also reported that 85per cent of the tea consumed in the US is iced. In Steel Magnolia's, Dolly Parton's character Truvy called sweet tea the 'house wine of the South' because of its abundant consumption. Across the pond, the British drink their tea with milk, but it is also common to have it served black, with lemon or sugar. The creation of the traditional afternoon tea in the United Kingdom is credited to Anna Marie Russell, Duchess of Bedford, who in 1840 began having tea with a small snack around 4pm to fight off that 'sinking feeling'. Caloric beverage: A Buddhist nun is pictured drinking Tibetan yak butter tea, which is made from tea leaves, yak butter, water and salt . Liquid dinner: Mongolian tea or suutei tsai (pictured) is known for its distinct salty flavor. It is typically made with water, milk, black or green tea and salt . Cool cups: In South America, mate tea (pictured) is made by filling a hollow gourd with dried yerba mate leaves and hot water. It is served with a filtered straw that is usually made out of silver . But there would be no such thing as tea time, if it wasn't for the discovery of tea leaves in China. According to legend, Chinese Emperor Shen-Nung came across the beverage in 2737 BC after some tea leaves accidentally blew into his pot of boiling water. Tea originated in China as a medicinal drink and is still widely consumed for its health benefits. The Alishan tea district in Chiayi County, Taiwan is famous for its production and consumption of oolong tea, a partially-oxidized tea made from leaves that are withered in direct sunlight. Tea is also an important part of Russian culture. While the warming beverage used to be served in the afternoon, Russians now consume it throughout the day - very possibly to stave off the cold. In Russia, tea is a two-step brewing process. A large quantity of tea concentrate is first brewed in a teapot to serve several people. For their individual glasses, each person mixes a portion of the concentrate with hot water according to taste, making it stronger or weaker depending on their personal preference. Sweet drink: Thai tea, known as 'cha-yen' is made with brewed Ceylon tea that is mixed with condensed milk and sugar before being served over ice and topped with evaporated milk . Floral arrangement: Tea originated in China as a medicinal drink and is still widely consumed for its health benefits. This picture shows a tea pot filled with a Chinese herbal flower tea . Traditional Kuwaiti tea (pictured) is a variation of brewed tea leaves that are served hot with the addition of saffron and cardamom pods to enhance the flavor . In Morocco, tea is a sign of hospitality and is often served to guests. Offering tea as a means of welcoming visitors to your home was once somewhat of a ceremonial process because hosts used to elaborately prepare it in front of their guests. While tea is now commonly made in the kitchen, the traditional ceremony is still observed for more formal occasions. Moroccan mint tea, which is a variation of green tea made with spearmint leaves and sugar, is served throughout the country. For those who prefer their tea to have a creamier texture, milk teas are popular in Thailand and Hong Kong. Thai tea, known as 'cha-yen' is made with brewed Ceylon tea that is mixed with condensed milk and sugar before being served over ice and topped with evaporated milk. Meanwhile, Hong Kong milk tea is black tea that is made with evaporated milk or sweetened condensed milk. It is nicknamed 'pantyhose' or 'silk stocking' tea because it is brewed in a sackcloth bag used to filter the leaves. It is also used as a base for 'Yuanyang' or 'Yingyong', which is a beloved drink in Hong Kong that combines the creamy tea with coffee for an added treat. Pretty plates: Turkish tea (pictured) is a black tea that is served without milk. Tea is an important part of Turkey's culture and is readily available throughout the country . National product: Alishan tea district in Chiayi County, Taiwan is famous for its production and consumption of oolong tea (pictured), a partially-oxidized tea made from leaves that are withered in direct sunlight . Texas longhorns: According to the Tea Association of the USA, 85per cent of the tea consumed in the US is iced . There are also teas that are flavored with salt and even butter. Tibetan butter tea is made from tea leaves, yak butter, water and salt. The filling, calorie-rich beverage is customarily consumed throughout the day. While it may seem strange to put such a fattening substance into your tea, butter coffee is gaining popularity in the US because of claims that it energizes and burns fat in the body all day long. Mongolian tea or suutei tsai is known for its distinct salty flavor. It is typically made with water, milk, black or green tea and salt. But instead of steeping fine tea leaves, suutei tsai is made with the coarse part of the plant. Butter, rice and noodles are also commonly added when making the unique tea. And in South America, drinking mate tea is somewhat of a bonding experience. A container, usually a hollow gourd, is filled with dried yerba mate leaves and hot water and served with a filtered straw that is usually made out of silver. It is common for friends to take sips of the beverage, refill it and pass it around. British tea time: A glass of Earl Grey tea is served with lemon and side of shortbread biscuits and scones topped with clotted cream and jam . Keeping warm: This Russian dining room table is set for afternoon tea. Tea is an important part of Russian culture and is now consumed throughout the day .

"Starbucks has had to apologize for a poster displayed in at least one store that showed Armenian women in traditional clothing drinking the company's coffee under the crescent and star of the Turkish flag. The posters angered Armenian-Americans because they say more than a million Armenians were killed at the hands of Turkish Ottoman forces in the early 20th Century. The Armenian National Committee of America posted a photo of the advertisement on Facebook and asked why the company would use such an image. The posters, showing Armenian women in traditional clothing drinking the Starbucks under the crescent and star of the Turkish flag, angered Armenian Americans because more than a million Armenians were killed at the hands of Turkish Ottoman forces in the early 20th Century . 'Why is Starbucks selling coffee using an image of women, dressed in traditional Armenian costumes, celebrating a Turkish state that systematically victimized Armenian women during the Armenian genocide, and that still denies this crime against all humanity?' ANCA wrote. More than 1.5million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Forces between 1915 and 1918 in what is now considered Eastern Turkey. But the Turkish government has rejected the term 'genocide', claiming both Turks and Armenians committed atrocities at that time. The poster was displayed in at least one Starbucks in Los Angeles - a city that's home to more than 440,000 people with Armenian ancestry. Starbucks has since posted an apology on ANCA's Facebook page and promised to remove the offensive advertisements. 'Serving as a place for the community to connect is core to our business and we strive to be locally relevant in all of our stores,' a spokesman for Starbucks wrote. 'We missed the mark here and we apologize for upsetting our customers and the community.' ANCA executive director Aram Hamparian told The Guardian that they became aware of the posters on February 18. ANCA believes posters were could be seen in at least 'two or three locations in Southern California'. People lay flowers at the monument to Armenians killed by Ottoman Turks during World War I in Yerevan, in April 2014, to mark the 99th anniversary of the Armenian genocide . 'It became very clear very quickly that this was a very serious issue for the entire community, because we started getting a flood of concern,' Hamparian told The Guardian, adding that Starbucks had responded 'very appropriately'. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the mass killing of Armenians under Ottoman rule, and preparations are happening world wide. The mass killings have been recognized as a genocide in more than 20 countries, including the United States, Germany and Russia. Armenian president Serzh Sarkisian recalled parliamentary protocols aimed at establishing diplomatic relations with Turkey earlier this month. Serkisian accused Ankara of lacking 'political will' and derailing the process with 'preconditions'. The killings in 1915 are regarded by many historians as the first genocide of the 20th century, and are said to have inspired Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.","Posters displayed Armenian women in traditional clothing under the crescent and star of of the Turkish flag .

"An 85-year-old woman died of a broken heart just days after the death of her husband - who she had been with for 72 years. Norman and Margaret Balkwill, both 85, both passed away peacefully in hospital - just eight days apart - after spending their whole adult lives together. The couple, who met at a Christmas party when they were just 13, spent their final moments on different wards at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital. Margaret and Norman Balkwill were together for 72 years before dying just days apart . But Betty was able to be wheeled to her husband’s bedside shortly before he passed away. Their nephew, Ray Balkwill, of Exmouth, Devon, said: ‘After Norman died, Betty died just eight days later. I think she just pined away without him. ‘They were a wonderful couple who lived for each other.’ Norman and Betty (nee Craker) had met at a festive party 72 years ago and their friendship blossomed throughout their school days in Exeter. Norman and Margaret (Betty) Balkwill, pictured on Hayling Island in 1958, married in 1955 . The couple, pictured on holiday Tenerife in 1980, did not have any children as 'they only needed each other' They eventually married on March 26, 1955, in St Michael & All Angels, Alphington. Norman worked as a butcher and shipping agent while Betty worked in the civil service at the old Army Records Office in Exeter 34 years. Close friend of the couple Derek Blatchford said: ‘They were a devoted couple. They go on so well. ‘They did not have children - they just needed each other. Margaret - known as Betty - died just eight days after Norman (pictured together on Hayling Island in 1958) ‘The last two years had been a trial for Betty and she was chair-bound, unable to get about. ‘When she was taken into hospital Norman was unable to cope on his own in the house and he was given respite care. ‘But he got pneumonia and was taken into hospital too. They were in different wards but Betty was brought to his bedside at the end. ‘They will be really missed but I suppose if they had to go this would have been the way they wanted it. They were devoted to each other for so many years.’ The couple will have a joint funeral at Exeter Crematorium on Thursday, February 26.","Norman and Margaret Balkwill met at a Christmas party in 1943 .

"Nearly a million Americans may have to wait longer to get their tax refunds this year thanks to a clerical error linked to ObamaCare. The Obama administration revealed today it sent about 800,000 HealthCare.gov customers the wrong tax information, and officials are asking those consumers to delay filing their 2014 taxes. Another 50,000 or so who already filed may have to resubmit their returns. The tax mistake is a self-inflicted injury that comes on the heels of what President Barack Obama had touted as a successful enrollment season, with about 11.4million people signed up. Oops! About 800,000 HealthCare.gov customers got the wrong tax information from the government, and officials are asking those affected to delay filing their 2014 returns . Glitch: Errors have been discovered in new tax forms called 1095-As, which are like W-2 for health care . California, which is running its own insurance market, on Thursday announced a similar problem affecting about 100,000 people in that state. Federal officials also announced Friday a special sign-up extension for uninsured people facing the health care law's tax penalties for the first time this year. Several million households could benefit from that grace period, which had been sought by Democratic lawmakers in Congress. Uninsured people who go to file their taxes and learn they're facing a penalty will have between March 15 and April 30 to sign up for subsidized coverage through HealthCare.gov. The fines for being uninsured are going up in 2015. The tax error highlights the complicated links between Obama's health care law and taxes, connections that consumers will experience for the first time this year. The law subsidizes private health insurance for people who don't have access to job-based coverage. By delivering those subsidies through the income tax system, the White House and the law's supporters were able to tout the health care overhaul as a tax cut. But it also introduced new wrinkles to an already-complicated tax system. The errors disclosed Friday are in new forms that HealthCare.gov sent to millions of consumers receiving coverage through the federal insurance market that serves most states. It's that time again: Obama administration officials are asking the 800,000 consumers affected by the error to delay filing their 2014 taxes . Those forms, called 1095-As, are like a W-2 for health care. They provided a month-by-month accounting of the subsidies consumers received to help pay their premiums. That information is then used to make sure everybody got the right amount, not too much, or too little. Andy Slavitt, a top administration official overseeing federal health insurance programs, said the administration is still investigating the root cause of the problem. Slavitt said it had to do with erroneous calculations of a 'benchmark' premium that is used to help determine the amount of subsidies that individuals receive. It's unclear how the error would affect consumers, Slavitt said. He said it's a mix of people who would have gotten too much assistance with their premiums, or too little. Slavitt said the administration started notifying the affected consumers today. He urged them to wait to file their taxes until they receive corrected forms. An estimated 50,000 who have already filed will receive special instructions from the Treasury Department, he said. 'We're not doing any victory laps,' HealthCare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan told reporters.","Obama administration sent 800,000 HealthCare.gov customers wrong tax information .

"The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has so far killed more than 9,300 people . It is a debate that has been raging since the Ebola epidemic reached crisis point last year. Will the vicious disease, which has killed more than 9,300 people, mutate to become an airborne virus potentially making it infinitely more deadly? Health experts have firmly proclaimed Ebola viruses are not airborne and can only be transmitted through direct contact with infected bodily fluids. But an international team of scientists have now thrown that assertion into doubt. In an opinion piece published in mBio, the journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team make their case. They reviewed past studies examining past outbreaks of Ebola within human populations, as well as animal studies. Their aim? To establish what is known and what is not known about how the virus spreads. And their findings conclude, that while current knowledge is nowhere near complete, airborne infectious Ebola particles are likely to play some role in transmission. 'It is very likely that at least some degree of Ebola virus transmission currently occurs via infectious aerosols generated from the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, or medical procedures, although this has been difficult to definitively demonstrate or rule out, since those exposed to infectious aerosols also are most likely to be in close proximity to and in direct contact with an infected case,' they wrote. They go on to suggest that Ebola viruses do have the potential to evolve in the future into airborne pathogens, 'particularly if extensive ongoing human transmission results in selective virus evolution'. But Professor Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Reading told MailOnline Ebola remains a blood borne infection and as a result is very unlikely to spread through airborne particles. He said he has 'absolutely no issue at all' that if you were to generate some droplets contaminated with Ebola, they could be a potential source of infection, because of the route the virus takes via mucus membranes. But, he cautioned, it is a 'leap of faith' to suggest the virus can therefore be transmitted via an airborne route. 'The reality is that this virus ends up in the blood stream, that's where most replication happens,' Professor Ball told MailOnline. 'It is a blood borne virus, therefore it is difficult to say how the virus could set up the lung associated infections which would generate the symptoms associated with respiratory transmission, through sneezes and coughs. 'The bottom line is if you say airborne to the general public they start to immediately think the virus could be spread through someone coughing. 'The reality is there is no evidence it is changing the way it behaves.' Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading agreed. He said the possibility Ebola might travel through the air is 'interesting from scientific perspective', but he warned 'talking about it as if it is actually happening in Africa right now would be irresponsible speculation'. He told MailOnline: 'The study in question poses some interesting ""what if"" questions for researchers to ponder, and we shouldn't get carried away. 'Ebola is just not well adapted to spreading except by contact with bodily fluids.' As part of their analysis Dr Osterholm and colleagues noted a few animal studies have pointed to the possibility that Ebola could potentially spread via aerosols. One piece of research revealed two monkeys developed the virus 10 and 11 days after the death of infected monkeys kept in an enclosure three meters away. Those infected with the disease were housed in the same room but efforts were made to ensure they were separated from the control group of three monkeys. The researchers suggested the two control monkeys had been infected through aerosol, oral or conjunctival exposure to droplets carrying the virus. They added that studies of the dead monkey's lung tissue supported the theory they had become infected via airborne particles. Similarly in another study, four caged macaques monkeys became infected with Ebola after being placed close to six infected piglets. The animals were separated by a wire barrier, and the piglets were kept at least 20cm from the macaques' cages at all times. The researchers concluded that while the virus could have spread through airborne particles, other routes were also possible, including droplets landing on items in the cages. Experts assessing past studies looking at how the virus spreads, have concluded that airborne transmission of the virus is 'very likely at some degree' But, in contrast, Dr Osterholm and his team did also note another study where two monkeys did not contract Ebola despite being placed next to two infected animals in open-barred cages for several days. The team's argument hinges on the need, they believe, for a revision of the traditional ideas around how viruses are transmitted. Currently it is accepted that transmission happens in one of two ways. A new test that can diagnose Ebola in just 15 minutes has been approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test Kit is based on detection of the Ebola protein in the blood. WHO said the test is rapid, easy to perform and does not require electricity. 'It can therefore be used at lower health care facilities or in mobile units for patients in remote settings,' the UN health agency added. The new method is less accurate than the Nucleic acid tests (NATs) that have previously been used but offers a far quicker way of identifying the disease. The agency said NATs require established laboratories and fully trained personnel and can take between 12 and 24 hours. When compared with the results of an NAT previously listed by WHO and currently being used in the field, the new test was able to identify about 92 per cent of Ebola infected patients and 85 per cent of those who were not infected with the virus. The agency said it is therefore recommending that where possible, results should be confirmed by using an NAT as well. Dr Ben Neuman, lecturer in virology at the University of Reading, said: 'The new antigen test is not a game-changer, but it is another useful tool in the fight against Ebola. 'The new test is small, cheap and portable, but is less sensitive than the gold-standard test that is used to diagnose early-stage Ebola in the clinics now. 'The new test could help to quickly confirm outbreaks in remote areas without the need to send samples to a testing clinic and wait for results. 'The new test isn't about saving the lives of infected people, but it can help in the long run by making it easier and quicker to detect Ebola outbreaks.' Either large droplets make direct contact with the skin or a mucus membrane, or a person becomes infected with a virus by inhaling small airborne particles at a distance from the source. But the authors say these models fail to recognise that infectious aerosols 'include suspended particles in a wide range of particle sizes that are easily inhaled by someone standing near the point of generation. 'Thus, aerosol inhalation can occur both near and far from an infectious source'. They note that vomiting caused by norovirus is known to produce infectious aerosols that cause the illness to spread. But add, norovirus is not thought of as a respiratory virus. They believe that could also be the case for Ebola, because infectious suspended particles may be generated by vomiting, diarrhoea and coughing. To test their theory, Dr Osterholm and his colleagues created Ebola virus aerosols and sought to find out their decay rates. Their findings estimate that the Zaire strain, that triggered the epidemic in West Africa, can survive in suspended airborne particles for around 100 minutes. Despite their assertion that Ebola could already be airborne, Dr Osterholm and his colleagues acknowledged direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected patient remains the primary way the virus spreads. They noted the virus has been found in saliva, breast milk, urine, and the semen of sufferers. Meanwhile they also found viral DNA has been found in sweat, tears and stools, as well as in rectal, conjunctival, vaginal and skin swabs. And the authors note that the available data on how Ebola spreads is very limited, leaving their findings uncertain. They said the evidence available currently does not show the disease to be a primary lung infection. But they add it is worth asking whether this could happen in the future, noting it could be possible because the virus can be isolated from saliva and can infected cells found in the respiratory system. Dr Osterholm and colleagues ultimately agree with the recognised advice that airborne transmission of Ebola is unlikely because it would require the virus to mutate significantly. But, they add, 'with phenotypic changes (physical or biochemical characteristics of the organism) in the virus, aerosol transmission... involving droplets of various sizes from cases in relatively close proximity to uninfected persons remains plausible'. Admitting the epidemic still ever present in West Africa took public health officials by surprise, they warned 'we should not assume that Ebola viruses are not capable of surprising us again at some point in the future'. In October the World Health Organisation stated Ebola is not an airborne infection and added it is not likely to become one. In a statement officials said airborne transmission 'has not been observed during extensive studies of the Ebola virus over several decades' Dr Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, sparked the debate last September, in an opinion piece in the New York Times. He put forward the idea that Ebola viruses could mutate to become transmissible through the air. Acknowledging that public health experts were talking of the possibilty behind closed doors, for fear of generating hysteria, Dr Osterholm warned 'the risk is real, and until we consider it, the world will not be prepared to do what is necessary to end the epidemic'. Such was the level of concern, that the World Health Organisation, responded. The agency said Ebola is not an airborne infection and was not likely to become one. 'Airborne spread among humans implies inhalation of an infectious dose of virus from a suspended cloud of small dried droplets,' a  statement said. 'This mode of transmission has not been observed during extensive studies of the Ebola virus over several decades.' Dr Osterholm, from the University of Minnesota, worked with experts from other US academic institutions, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Doctors Without Borders, and the WHO.","Debate over whether Ebola will infect people through airborne particles has raged since the epidemic in West Africa reached crisis point last year .
Now, new analysis of past studies, concludes it is 'very likely'
Scientists noted research where healthy animals kept at a distance from infected ones died from the virus .
But the team acknowledge the primary form of transmission remains contact with the bodily fluids of an Ebola patient .
Say airborne infection is still 'plausible' noting the virus surprised experts examining the West African outbreak, and could do so again ."
"A woman who was abused by her father and went on to have his baby has revealed she is starting to rebuild her life after her attacker was jailed. Hollie Davey, 26, from Essex, was abused, molested and raped as a young girl by Paul Davey falling pregnant with his child twice - the first she lost after he carried out a home abortion. She tracked him down at the age of 13 after being raised by an adoptive family. Speaking for the first time about her ordeal since her father was jailed, Miss Davey said she will 'never get over' what he did to her after he stole her childhood away from her. Hollie Davey from Essex has revealed her harrowing experiences of being raped and molested by her father . Hollie (pictured left as a child) found out she was adopted when she was 13 and went on to track down her father Paul Davey (right) Miss Davey, who has since had three daughters, Alayla, six, Roxanne, four and Amelia, two, revealed the son she gave birth to after her father raped her was taken into care. Her harrowing experience started at the age of 13 when she found out she was adopted and decided to track down her real father after her biological mother passed away. But after excitedly showing up on his doorstep in 2001 Hollie's decision to locate Paul - who is now in prison - would turn out to be one of the biggest mistakes of her life. 'When I arrived, a man with grey hair answered the door and asked me if he could help,' she said. 'I told him I was his daughter and though he looked shocked, he pulled me in for a hug. 'He said he had been waiting for the moment he got to meet me,' she said. Miss Davey and her father spent the night catching up then he asked her to move in with him. He told Miss Davey he did not want to lose her. She said: 'With those words I felt like I belonged and I settled down in to dad's spare room.' Hollie has revealed how she rain away from her father after becoming pregnant for the second time . But while she was keen to develop a father-daughter bond, Miss Davey's father had other ideas. Within weeks he was dressing her in a wedding dress and molesting her. She said: 'One day while I was reading a magazine dad started to run his fingers though my hair. 'Then he said, ""You're gorgeous, I can't believe you're my daughter"". It made me feel uneasy. But I was desperate for dad to love me, so I told myself I was just being silly.' But Davey continued to behave in a way that made his daughter feel uncomfortable. After they had been living together for two months, he suggested playing the game, 'mummies and daddies'. Miss Davey said: 'I thought it was strange being that I was almost 14, but I didn't want to annoy my dad.' Davey then handed her a wedding dress and told he to put it on. Hollie said: 'I put it on and played along with him.' Hollie is now happy with her three daughters, she has no contact with the son she had with her father . Next, her father asked her to pose on the bed so he could take some photos of her wearing the gown. Miss Davey said: 'It felt wrong but what could I do?' Later that night she heard her bedroom door creak. 'Dad said, ""I'll sleep here tonight so I can be with my gorgeous daughter"",' Miss Davey said. 'But he started touching me. 'I told him to stop it and tried to pull away but he ignored me and carried on touching me.' Before long, Davey was visiting his daughter's room every night to molest her. She said: 'He would call me his ""special girl"" and I would lay in bed limp, trying to pretend it wasn't happening.' Then one morning, Davey bundled his daughter in to his car and drove her to a deserted road to rape her. Hollie said: 'He told me to shut up, tore at my clothes and held me down on the passenger seat. I waited for it to be over but dad said, ""There's more where that came from"". 'I wondered how he could do this to me. I thought he loved me.' At home, Davey locked his daughter in the house and forced her to wear the wedding dress again. He took more photos of her, then thrust a silver ring on her wedding ring finger and said, 'I want you to be my wife'. Miss Davey said: 'I wanted to throw up. He was sick. I felt caged up like an animal.' Hollie holds one of her girls, she made her escape from her father after finding the front door unlocked . Hollie realised she could not hide her experience in case her father was also abusing other children . After coming forward a second woman also revealed she had been molested by Paul Davey . Davey continued to rape his daughter for months to come and eventually she fell pregnant. Desperate to end it, he forced her to down a bottle of gin then performed a home abortion with a knitting needle. Miss Davey said: 'I remember blood running down my legs and it must have panicked my dad because he took me to hospital. 'I wanted to scream at the nurses, ""My dad did this to me,"" but I was petrified of the consequences. 'But if I thought this was going to scare him in to stopping him raping me, I was wrong.' At 15, Miss Davey fell pregnant a second time, but on this occasion she hid it from her father. She said: 'Even though the baby had been created by a monster, it was my baby.' Then one night when her dad was asleep, Miss Davey noticed that the front door was unlocked and made a break for freedom. She said: 'I realised, I was finally free.' Miss Davy gave birth to a son, but social services took him away. She blamed her father and, determined not to let him destroy any more of her life, she started college and got her own flat. She went on to have three daughters, then one day she realised that her father was still out there, prowling the streets and could be abusing other children. She said: 'I realised he couldn't get away with this so I contacted a solicitor and went to the police.' She underwent DNA tests, which proved her father was in fact her son's dad, too. Then, a second woman came forward to report that she too had been abused by Miss Davey's father. In July 2013, Paul Davey, then 63, from Suffolk, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court and pleaded not guilty to rape, indecent assault and one attempt of procuring a miscarriage. He was convicted of all counts and jailed for 16 years. Miss Davey said: 'I'll never get over what my dad did. I wish I hadn't gone looking for him. He ruined my childhood. But I'm now back in touch with my adoptive family and am finally happy.'","Hollie Davey from Essex was abused by her father from the age of 13 .

"Peter Mandelson warns cutting tuition fees could lead to universities shunning British students in favour of those from abroad . Labour’s plan to reduce tuition fees could cause universities to shun home students in favour of those from abroad, Peter Mandelson has warned. The former cabinet minister said reducing the £9,000 fee cap for those who live in Britain may mean universities recruit more international students to plug the funding gap. He said such a move would ‘not be desirable’ if it came ‘at the expense’ of British students. He added: ‘While I strongly welcome foreign students to Britain, I would not want to see them receiving preference over British students because of the greater income they bring to universities.’ It comes after figures revealed British universities are already spending millions on agencies to recruit wealthy students from outside the EU. There is no limit to how much an institution can charge non-EU students, although there are limits in some courses. The average annual fee for an international student last year was £11,289 for classroom subjects and £13,425 for laboratory-based courses, but some institutions charge considerably more. Last year, Edinburgh University announced it planned to increase its international population to 50 per cent, although it denied this would put limits on home student numbers. In a survey released this month by Times Higher Education, academics complained they were having to lower the level of classes for people with poor English – ‘to the disadvantage of native speakers’. Labour leader Ed Miliband recently indicated he would pledge to cut fees for home students from their current level of £9,000 to £6,000, although a formal announcement is not due until next week. Lord Mandelson spoke about the issue as part of a wide-ranging speech to Vice Chancellors at Universities UK, which represents the sector. Speaking before the event, he said: ‘Anything that would boost the number of foreign students at the expense of British students would not be desirable and if you reduce fees for British students, you could not be surprised if universities turned to foreign students to make up the gap in funding.’ The former cabinet minister said reducing the £9,000 fee cap for those who live in Britain may mean universities recruit more international students to plug the funding gap. Stock photo . While he made it clear he did not want to go ‘head-to-head’ with his party, he said any reduction of the fee cap needed to be replaced by alternative funding sources. He also warned of the need to protect research-intensive universities, quality of education and widening participation of young people. In the year 2013-14, 13 per cent of the 2,299,355 total enrolments at British higher education institutions were by students from outside the EU.","Reducing £9,000 fee cap for those who live in Britain may mean universities recruit more international students to plug funding gap .

"India has unveiled a massive military spending plan that will see it splash out more than £10billion on a fleet of new warships and submarines. The country, which has received £1.6billion in aid from Britain in the past eight years, will bolster its navy by building seven frigates at a cost of £5.2billion. A further £5.2billion will be spent on six nuclear-powered submarines. Scroll down for video . Military prowess: India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi (centre) wants to build a strong military for fear the country would be unable to fight a two-front war with China and Pakistan . The defence plans follow the successful launch of a rocket capable of manned space flight at an estimated cost of £250million. Britain is stopping its handouts, totalling around £210million this year, from the end of this December. But many more millions will head towards Delhi in the form of private sector expertise and technical assistance. India’s government has cleared the plan to build its most advanced warships only months after making its order for new submarines in October. The orders are part of a plan to try to close the gap with the Chinese navy in the Indian Ocean. Since taking over last year, prime minister Narendra Modi has signalled his resolve to build a strong military following claims the country would be unable to fight a two-front war against China and Pakistan. The decision to bolster India’s navy comes after it has been rattled in recent months by the presence of Chinese submarines docked in Sri Lanka, just off its southern coast. The Indian frigates, which are being made in a programme called Project-17A, will be built at the government shipyards in Mumbai and Kolkata. There has been growing anger from Tory backbenchers over spending on Britain’s aid budget at a time when public services are being slashed in the UK. Tory MP Peter Bone said last night: ‘This is why we should not be giving any aid to India. It was not aid that brought India out of poverty but trade. Aid is just a sticking plaster.’ Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, said: ‘It is clear that India is becoming a wealthy country if it is able to spend such a colossal amount on its military. ‘There is absolutely no justification for Dfid [the Department for International Development] to now be spending any money on India. Security: The frigates, which are being made in a programme called Project-17A, will be built at government shipyards in Mumbai and Kolkata . ‘It’s a pity it’s taken this long to put a stop to it, but at least the decision has now been taken.’ In 2012 the Government announced the current eight-year £1.6billion aid package running until the end of this year would be the last. The amount of aid to India will reduce to £35.1million by 2016/2017. The decision came after India’s finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told the Indian parliament: ‘We do not require the aid. It is a peanut in our total development spending.’ Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, said: ‘It is time to recognise India’s changing place in the world. ‘After reviewing the programme and holding discussions with the government of India, we agreed that now is the time to move to a relationship focusing on skill sharing rather than aid.’ In reply, India’s foreign minister, Salman Khurshid, said: ‘Aid is the past and trade is the future.’ Earlier this month, a major report warned that Britain’s foreign aid budget has been increased so quickly that ministers and officials were ‘struggling’ to spend it properly. It found that they were ‘unprepared’ for the challenge of spending a 30 per cent increase in the budget last year. The increase followed David Cameron’s controversial pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of the UK’s income on foreign aid. In a devastating conclusion, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact said there was only ‘limited evidence’ that the money made a real difference in the world’s poorest countries. In some cases it may even have made problems worse.","Country will bolster navy with seven frigates and six nuclear submarines .

"Three men were caught with a massive cache of lethal weapons after their racket was foiled by a group of inquisitive school children, a court heard. Darren Alcock, Paul Estridge and Stuart Manners had a huge haul of pistols, stun guns, knuckle dusters and knives in Stockport, Greater Manchester, that were destined to be used in organised crime. But the men were thwarted when a group of children uncovered a 9mm pistol and 21 rounds of ammunition dumped in a bush and called the police. Today the trio were jailed for a combined total of 38 years at Manchester Crown Court after being convicted of firearms charges. Police uncovered a massive cache of weapons after a group of children discovered a gun dumped in bushes in Stockport, Greater Manchester . Estridge, 46, from Liverpool, pictured left, and Stuart Manners, 46, from Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, pictured right, were jailed for 12 years for conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition . Their potentially deadly arsenal, which included mini torches converted into guns, was uncovered by chance on August 3 last year. The court heard Alcock and Estridge had dumped the weapon in bushes after hearing police sirens behind them. Their car was pulled over after officers spotted Alcock talking on his mobile phone at the wheel. The pair were allowed to go, but the weapon they left behind was soon discovered a group of children, who had been playing nearby. Manners' DNA was found on the weapon and officers later linked it to Alcock and Estridge after examining their phone bills. All three were arrested  and when officers searched Manners' home in Sharston, Greater Manchester, they found Taurus Millennium self-loading Pistol containing one 9mm round along with a mini torch which was converted into a firearm with one round of ammunition. They also recovered a number of shooting targets, 79 rounds of 9mm ammunition, a mobile phone 'stun gun', a knuckle duster, carbon knives and two empty firearm magazines. As well as the gun the children found 21 rounds of ammunition in the carrier bag in the bush in Stockport . Among the arsenal were a number of mini torches that had been converted into firearms . A second torch which had been converted into a firearm was found in Manners car. Officers also raided Manners' storage unit in Stockport and found hundreds of small and large calibre bullets as well as a gun cleaning kit and a large hunting knife. Police believe the weapons were destined to be used in organised crime. Alcock, 45, from Liverpool was handed 14 years in prison with a further four years on license after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition. Estridge, 46, from Liverpool, and Stuart Manners, 46, from Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, were jailed for 12 years for conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition. A torch that had been converted into a firearm was also found in the car of Stuart Manners . Police said that by removing the weapons they have prevented further crimes from being committed . Speaking after the sentencing hearing Detective Sergeant Mike Cain from Titan, North West Regional Crime unit, said: 'Today's result sends out a strong message to anyone who gets involved with guns - that they can expect to face a lengthy prison sentence. 'The firearms and the ammunition were clearly intended for use in organised crime and would no doubt have led to serious injury or death. 'We are committed to investigating and prosecuting those who use, store or supply guns for criminal purpose. 'By removing these weapons and ammunition we have without doubt prevented further crimes from happening.'

"Cereal fever seems to have taken hold in Britain as the country welcomes its second cereal-only cafe. Best friends Zoe Blogg and pal Jen Gibb have opened the breakfast-speciality joint Moo'd in Leeds. Moo'd offers more than 100 different cereals, as well as 'cocktails' consisting of mixed varieties of different brands - and the milk for cereals comes from an old ale pump. Scroll down for the video. Zoe Blogg and pal Jen Gibb have opened thee breakfast-speciality joint Moo'd in, Hedingley, Leeds . The duo say they registered their business before London cafe Cereal Killers . The duo reckon they are on to a winner after being swarmed with hungry customers on their opening day - eager to have a bowl of the breakfast treat. Unlike their hipster rivals who were slammed after opening expensive Cereal Killer Cafe in one of the poorest parts of inner-city London, Zoe and Jen are offering much more reasonably-priced bowls of unusual cereals. So far, Moo'd has gone down a storm with Leeds locals, no doubt impressed with the modest £2-a-bowl pricetag and the fact the milk comes from an old ale pump. Speaking to student newspaper The Tab, Zoe, 23, said: 'We came up with the idea when we were students in Leeds. 'We both wanted to go out and get a bowl of cereal but all we could get were fry-ups. There will be more than 100 different types of cereal from all over the world served in the cafe . 'We actually registered our business before Cereal Killers registered theirs, so it's not like we saw their idea and copied it. 'We've been working on Moo'd for nearly a year now.' Moo'd offers more than 100 different cereals, as well as 'cocktails' consisting of mixed varieties of different brands. Zoe said: 'We spent ages trying to work out what combinations of cereals worked for the cocktails. 'We had one idea called 'What Nana Eats,' which had Shreddies, Bran Flakes and Pink Wafers but that was ridiculously dry.' Zoe and Jen are taking their new business seriously, with hopes to introduce a takeaway option and expand into other cities. The pair met on a marketing course at Leeds Beckett University, before starting work on the project last year. Identical twins Alan and Gary Keery from Belfast are set to open the UK's first cereal cafe in Brick Lane, London . Jen, also 23, added: 'We had one woman from UKIP on the telly say it was 'a waste of money and resources', and another person said everyone should have a fry-up every day, but apart from that the feedback we've got has been great.' Leeds University second year Politics student Aron Keller was one of the first to visit the cafe when it opened on Thursday. He said: 'After the recent opening of the UK's first cereal cafe  in East London recently, I was intrigued to see what Moo'd in Leeds had to offer. 'The owners were really friendly and enthusiastic. 'The vibe is hip but not too kitschy. 'The cafe itself is small but spacious and there's a definite quaint, coffee-shop feel about the place.' Not wanting to be left behind, two rivals are racing to become Manchester's first cereal cafe. Black Milk Cereal Dive has confirmed it will open in Afflecks Palace next month and according to Twitter, Cereal Central MCR is 'coming soon'. Both establishments will serve breakfast cereals from around the world. An international cereal menu: Offerings from America include Banana Puffs and Reese's Puffs . It comes months after Alan and Gary Keery opened the country's first cereal cafe in Shoreditch, London. With 120 cereals, 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk, self-confessed cereal obsessives the twins have taken their love of the breakfast staple to new heights with UK's first cereal cafe. The establishment opened last December in Brick Lane, London and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world. Open from 7am to 8pm, The Cereal Killer Cafe srves breakfast, lunch and dinner in an environment bursting with 'cereal memorabilia from the Eighties and Nineties'. There are also vintage televisions dotted about the interior, running old cartoons on a loop. The idea of the cafe came to 32-year-old Belfast boys Alan and Gary when they were craving cereal for lunch one afternoon but couldn't find a restaurant that would serve them the breakfast main. 'We were wandering around Shoreditch one lunch looking for cereal when the lightbulb moment hit,' Gary told FEMAIL. Cereal all the time:  Open from 7am to 8pm, the cafe will serve breakfast, lunch and dinner . There will be over 100 types of cereal on offer at the Cereal Killer Cafe  from America, South Korea and France . 'We researched, what cereals were available in the UK and which ones would be easy to source and took it from there.' Cereals are sourced from America, South Africa, France, Australia, South Korea as well as the UK and will be served alongside 13 varieties of milk as well as 20 types of topping. 'We have normal milk as well as lacto-free milk, oat milk, hazelnut milk and almond milk. There will also be varieties of flavoured milk,'Gary continued.

"One man has given new meaning to the term 'porta potty.' Union Hardware owner David Goldberg uploaded a video of his custom-built creation 'Loo-cy' to YouTube on Tuesday. The clip reveals that 'Loo-cy' is in fact a motorized toilet, and has a plow in front. On its platform, a toilet paper stand and some reading material are included. Do-it-yourself: David Goldberg built 'Loo-cy,' which comes with a toilet paper stand and some reading material . Long life: Before being used in a snowplow design, the toilet was called 'Loo-Cille,'  incorporated into a float and showcased at D.C. area events . 'Taking something very private and making it a spectacle is a jolt to the system by itself. But having it plow snow... Over the top!' the video's description says. The clip of Goldberg sitting on the throne as his machine plows a snowy sidewalk has already garnered over 57,000 YouTube views. Goldberg told Bethesda Magazine that the video's popularity 'shocked the hell out of me.' 'I'm really surprised about it, but when you look back, all the news at the time was about the snow, so it makes sense,' he told the website. Union Hardware's website says of the machine 'Introducing Loo-cy. Our Hybrid [sic] motorized Loo.. Loo-cy was first introduced in the DC Pride parade in 2014 as Loo-Cille. (white and pink) Next was a breakthough [sic] apearance [sic] at a car show in Potomac, Md, where Loo-Cille won 2nd place.' Design: Goldberg's 'Loo-cy' features two pedals, lacking brakes and a steering wheel . It continues 'When Loo-Cille was enterend [sic] in the Back to Betehsda [sic] car show during the Taste of Betehsda [sic], Loo-Cille got a make-over and became the Loo-cy that you see today. After 2 car shows, Loo-cy entered an air show in Gaithersburg, Md, where it delighted the crowd around the runway. When the winter hit, Loo-cy was fitted with a snowplow. The a [sic] video was taken and the crowd went wild.' The Washington Post reported that before those events, Goldberg made a 'snow bathroom' one year ago outside Union Hardware. Goldberg told the newspaper 'People are more attracted to toilets - this very private thing - out in public. I built an entire snow bathroom, but it's always the toilet people laugh at. ...They loved the toilet.' The newspaper reported that 'Loo-cy' was designed by Goldberg, and features two pedals, lacking brakes and a steering wheel. Goldberg told the Washington Post that the same toilet style is available for purchase inside Union Hardware. Look out! Goldberg's 'Loo-cy' also has a warning signs which say 'Heads up!'","Union Hardware owner David Goldberg built 'Loo-cy' the snowplow .

"Queen Letizia and her husband Felipe got in touch with their artistic sides at the inauguration of the First Picasso exhibition in Spain today. In fact, the Spanish royal, 42, seemed to be channelling the artist's own style by wearing a  black and white striped  top that echoed Malaga-born Picasso's favourite Breton striped T-shirts. While King Felipe's only concession to the arts was a patterned blue and white tie with his crisp blue suit, during the visit to the Museo de Belas Artes in A Coruna in the north west coastal region of Galicia. Scroll down for video . Queen Letizia and King Felipe of Spain attended the opening of the First Picasso exhibition in Galicia . Uterque Floral Clutch . Click to explore the Uterque website . Visit site . It's safe to say that Queen Letizia has become a bona fide style icon. With her inherently chic fashion sense and her savvy shopping choices, it's not hard to see why. Not only does she champion high fashion Spanish labels like Felipe Varela, but she also gets behind her home country's high-street brands by regularly rocking pieces from the likes of Zara and its sister brand Uterque. This fab floral clutch is from the latter and Letizia must be quite a fan, as she also has it in black! In this case, she's used the red version to expertly add a pop of color to a classic ensemble of a midi skirt, a breton stripe top and burgundy stilettos. The good news? This outfit is easily replicated. Dig out your trusty old bretons and simply team them with a black midi (a savvy, figure-flattering buy) and finish it all off with a blooming piece of arm candy.

Former journalist Letizia teamed her top with a high-waisted full black skirt, patent plum court shoes and a  plum clutch with leather flower decoration from Uterque. The shade is one of Letizia's favourites and today she picked her glossy plum lipstick to complete the look - along with a loose plaited up-do. And it's not the first time the royal pair have showed their interest in one of Spain's most famous artists. In September, they left daughters Leonor and Sofia at home to visit the Picasso Museum in Malaga, which celebrates the work of the famous spaniard, before attending a formal dinner. Meanwhile, the low-key royal proved that the Duchess of Cambridge isn't the only queen of thrift, with a penchant for recycling her outfits when she wore a black and white checked top this week, which she'd worn three times in the last four months.

"This is the shocking moment a heartless thief scams a shopper out of her bank card at a cashpoint. CCTV footage shows the swindler appearing to help his elderly victim as he leans over to tell her the ATM  is broken. As he speaks to the  woman, he uses a piece of paper to cover the the screen in order to secretly cancel her transaction. He is then seen pocketing her card. Scroll down for video . Police have released CCTV footage of a swindler (right) distracting a female shopper (left) at a cashpoint in order to steal her bank card . Police are currently investigating more than 20 similar distraction thefts across the West Midlands in a con which has already costs victims £9,000. The thieves are thought to be working in a group of three and officers believe they may be travelling from London to carry out their crimes. After distracting the cashpoint user, the conmen - who have also memorised the person's pin by looking over their shoulder - go on to use the card to withdraw hundreds from the bank account. Since receiving the first reports of the new tactic last October, officers have circulated CCTV of the suspects to other forces in a bid to trace them and have been trawling road cameras to find vehicles involved, but are yet to identify the culprits. The man, wearing a blue hat and grey tracksuit, leans over the woman as he appears to help her by telling her the ATM is broken . The thief uses a piece of paper while he talks to secretly cancel the transaction and pocket the woman's bank card . The man who approaches people at the cashpoints is described as Asian with a neatly trimmed beard, who always wears a hat. Detective Constable Christine Hammond is investigating the offences. She said: 'We're determined to find those responsible for these thefts but in the meantime, we're keen to spread the word and let people know what's happening so they can take steps to protect themselves. 'If you're at a cashpoint and someone approaches you, don't take their word for it that the machine isn't working. Simply ignore them and carry on as you are, making sure you keep your pin covered at all times. 'If you do spot any suspicious activity like this, then please call police straight away and - if you see them getting in and out of any vehicles - make a note of any registration numbers. 'Sadly, it's often older people - the most vulnerable in our society - who are the target of these crimes and I would urge anyone with information to call us on 101, or the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.'","CCTV reveals the shocking moment when the thief steals his victim's card .

"On a tiny Mediterranean island migrants wander in the streets, beg for oranges at the vegetable store, and knock on the door of the Roman Catholic church to ask the priest for shelter. These are the pitiful scenes in Italy’s Lampedusa where 2,700 men, women and children have arrived in five days after being rescued from rickety boats sailing to Europe from lawless Libya. Some are wrapped in charity blankets to keep out the cold. A few build fires on the beach to huddle around at night or sleep in the sand dunes. Tide of misery: Migrants outside the reception centre on Lampedusa. Numbers have swollen dramatically as Libya descends into chaos . Escape: Young men break through a fence at the Mediterranean island's migrant centre . Not far from the official migrant reception centre – where all beds are filled – families with children do their washing in the open air and hang it out to dry. Among them are Syrians and Libyans escaping the terrifying stranglehold of Islamic State terrorists in their country. Others have fled poverty, violence or religious oppression in Somalia, Eritrea, the Sudan, Nigeria, the Gambia, and Ethiopia. Yet these desperate souls all have something in common. They have reached Lampedusa, Europe’s southern-most point, by paying huge sums to people smuggling gangs for a place on an overcrowded boat from a Libyan port. The lucrative trade in human beings is thought to be controlled by, and financing, the flourishing Islamic State terror cells in Libya. Italy has warned of the ‘grave danger’ of IS building a foothold on Libya’s coast – 180 miles across the Mediterranean from Lampedusa – from where it could attack Europe. Italy’s foreign minister Paolo Gentiloni said this week that ‘time is running out’ for EU countries to forge a ‘robust response’ to the threat from just across the sea. In a further terrifying twist, European intelligence agencies believe that among the migrants waiting in Lampedusa are IS terrorists infiltrating Europe by the back-door by pretending to be refugees. Migrants walk at the harbour after they left the immigration centre on the southern Italian island of Lampedusa . 2,700 men, women and children have arrived in five days after being rescued from rickety boats sailing to Europe from lawless Libya . Lampedusa has long been a target for illegal migrants wanting a new life in Europe. Last year, 3,500 drowned making the attempt to sail from Libya. And earlier this month, another 300 died when their dinghies sank in high seas during the perilous journey. In the first nine months of 2014 alone, 140,000 slipped into Italy, the vast majority through Lampedusa. Today authorities on the island are struggling to cope. The migrants are gradually being flown off the island to holding centres in nearby Sicily and mainland Italy. But soon more boats are expected to arrive. As Libya descends into lawless chaos, the United Nations’ Refugee Agency (UNHCR) says the smuggling networks bringing them in now operate with impunity. This week, an Italian official added that conditions at the reception centre on Lampedusa were ‘getting desperate’. It has accommodation for only 400 but 1,000 are crammed in. Many of the younger men break through perimeter fences and take their chance on the streets. Save the Children, operating on the island, warned that food and basic clothing is running low which is making the situation ‘tense’. Desperate: Lampedusa has long been a target for illegal migrants wanting a new life in Europe . The migrants are gradually being flown off the island to holding centres in nearby Sicily and mainland Italy . The migrant numbers have now reached half the island’s resident population of 5,000. In 2010, before he was deposed and killed, Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi demanded £4billion a year from the European Union to stop Illegal mass migration of Africans by boat into Italy. He warned he would ‘turn Europe black’ if he did not get the money, which was refused. Today his threat appears to have been taken up by IS. Its fighters have threatened to flood Europe with half a million migrants in a ‘psychological’ attack on the West, according to leaked emails. Under EU rules, Italy has a duty to rescue any migrants on boats in its territorial waters. Amnesty has warned thousands more migrants will die on what is the ‘most dangerous sea crossing in the world’ unless rescue operations by Italy are increased. Yesterday the EU gave the country £10million (13.7million euros) to help it cope. EU commissioners said it was a ‘helping hand’. Meanwhile, a group of Christian migrants from sub-Saharan Africa were arriving at the Catholic church in Lampedusa asking for food and shelter. The priest handed them what he had – strings of rosary beads. The children put them round their necks and a girl began to pray.","2,700 men, women and children have arrived in Lampedusa in five days .

"The grandmother of a four-year-old girl who died when she crashed a motorbike she was forced to ride around her backyard has accused child protection officers of repeatedly ignoring her reports of child abuse. Chloe Valentine died from massive injuries in January 2012 after repeatedly crashing the motorbike she was forced to ride by her mother and her partner at their Adelaide home. Chloe's mother, Ashlee Polkinhorne, 22, and her ex-partner Benjamin McPartland, 28, are in prison after pleading guilty to the little girl's manslaughter by neglect. A coroner's inquest is now investigating the death. Scroll down for video . Belinda Valentine, the grandmother of Chloe Valentine, outside South Australia's Coroners' Court in Adelaide on Friday. Ms Valentine has told the inquiry her repeated attempts to warn authorities about Chloe's neglect at the hands of her parents were ignored. Polkinghorn's mother, Belinda Valentine, broke down while giving evidence at the inquest on Friday, as  she detailed her  attempts to have Chloe removed from her daughter's care. Ms Valentine said she repeatedly contacted Families SA to voice concerns about her daughter's neglect of the child, her drug-taking, alcohol abuse and Chloe's 'filthy' living conditions. She said that when she offered  to take Chloe into her care, a senior social worker told her: 'You have no right to take Chloe anywhere. 'I was really shocked - it gave Ashlee all the power to do basically whatever she wanted to do,'she said. Chloe Valentine was just four when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012 . The inquest has heard Chloe was forced to endure chronic neglect at the hands of her mother, who fell pregnant at 15. Despite more than 20 notifications made to Families SA since Chloe's birth, she was never removed from her mother's care by authorities. Ms Valentine says her daughter repeatedly threatened her, saying she would never see Chloe again if she spoke of taking her. 'She hated Families SA,' said Ms Valentine, adding that her daughter complained about them always interfering and describing them as 'a joke.' Ms Valentine told the court she often confronted her daughter about her  behaviour. On one occasion she went to rescue her and Chloe after an incident of domestic abuse. She found Chloe shaking and cowering in a corner and described how she, 'just clung to me, buried her head in my shoulder.' When Ms Valentine suggested Chloe should come to her home for a while, Polkinghorne became hysterical. 'She said I was trying to steal her child ... that I was trying to interfere.' Ms Valentine said she rang Families SA but the social worker said she had no right to take Chloe. Mother Ashlee Polkinghorne (pictured left and right) at court at an earlier date. The inquest has heard she and her boyfriend Benjamin Robert McPartland, 28, forced Chloe to ride a motorbike over three days which repeatedly crashed and caused massive head injuries . In December, the Coroner's Court heard how Chloe had suffered massive head injuries, cuts and bruises after being forced to ride the motorbike, repeatedly crashing, over a three day period in January 2012. In giving evidence to the court, social worker Tara Liston said she had struggled with her workload and had more severe cases than Chloe's in 2011. She told the court Chloe and her mother 'engaged really well', the ABC reported at the time. 'In comparison to other cases, when you read it, there were some things that Ashlee did well and there were other times that she didn't... it would be a case that was not as significant as other cases,' she had said. Other claims previously made in court by three people - including Jay Rann who was the child's respite carer - said Polkinghorne left sex toys and drugs around the house, called her daughter a 'c***' and also fed Chloe Hungry Jack's and spent her welfare money on herself. The court also heard allegations that the bathroom walls at Chloe's home was covered with 'dried faeces', according to The Advertiser. They also claimed Chloe sang 'I want a horny daddy'. Benjamin Robert McPartland, ex-parter of Chloe's mother Ashlee Polkinghorne, leaves the SA Supreme Court in 2013. He is in prison after pleading guilty to Chloe's manslaughter through criminal neglect. On December 1, social worker Katrina Heading told the inquest she considered removing Chloe when she was 16-months-old in November 2008 after her 'paralytic' mother left her with a 15-year-old friend while she drank at the beach. Ms Heading said Chloe was sent home unsupervised with a private chauffeur because there were only two crisis care staff working that night. She said the chauffeur company conducted police checks on its workers but Families SA did not have access to those checks. Counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, questioned whether it was appropriate for a 16-month-old child to be left unsupervised with a private driver. She asked why Ms Heading had not pushed harder to have Chloe removed, given Families SA had received multiple abuse notifications. 'You knew that this woman had left her child with a 15-year-old so that she could consume alcohol ... that's concern enough, isn't it?' she asked. Ms Heading said she had backed her supervisor's judgement, despite having reservations about Polkinghorne. Chloe died from massive head injuries after she was forced to ride a motorbike over a three-day period that repeatedly crashed at her Adelaide home . Families SA considered her to be at risk even before she was born and had received multiple calls about the girl by the time she was six weeks old. After 20 notifications were made to the child protection agency about Chloe's care, she was never removed from her drug-using mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne. Earlier in the inquest, evidence revealed how Polkinghorne, described by one concerned friend as a very convincing liar, was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers, who helped clean her house. One of the squalid residences she and Chloe occupied was reportedly infested with rats, while another was littered with soiled nappies and rotting food. It was alleged Chloe was also left for days on end with Polkinghorne's teenage friends. In October, social worker Nicholas Ratsch told the inquest he helped Polkinghorne draft a safety plan in late 2007 to make sure infant Chloe received proper care when her mother was affected by drugs. Polkinghorne, was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22-year-old's then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months . Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012 . Polkinghorne, who was 16 at the time, agreed that whenever she and her then-partner were out of it there would be a sober person at home. The strategy replaced a previous agreement, brokered by case workers, in which Polkinghorne pledged to cease all drug-taking. Another social worker, Leanne Stewart, also told the inquest in October that Polkinghorne was 'just a teenager' who found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her rubbish-strewn house. Ms Stewart said she believed 18-month-old Chloe was receiving 'good enough' care in early 2009, despite substantial evidence of neglect and multiple child abuse notifications, when her mother was 17. The inquest continues.","Belinda Valentine accused family services officials of being 'flippant' about  her reports of neglect .

"The family of an unarmed Mexican orchard worker shot dead by police after allegedly throwing rocks at cars have requested a fresh autopsy of his body by an independent examiner. Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, was killed last week when three officers opened fire on him at a busy intersection in Pasco, Washington. His death has become a new flashpoint in the debate over police violence in the wake of Ferguson after video of the killing appeared to show Montes running away from officers with his hands raised when he was hit. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The family of Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35 (pictured, his daughter Erika holds a photo of him), have requested a second autopsy as police investigate the shooting . According to Huffington Post his family could have the exam carried out today as investigators prepare toxicology reports before the case goes to an inquest. Yesterday Investigators asked the public to provide more  images and eyewitness accounts ofthe killing, which has sparked mass protests. They also asked for patience as they seek more information about the victim. Sgt. Ken Lattin of the nearby Kennewick Police Department said videos continue to arrive, adding: 'The more information we have, the better,' Authorities also are seeking more people who saw Montes, in the weeks before the shooting, so they can learn more about his frame of mind, Lattin said at a news conference. Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest against the police. Residents marched and staged 'die-ins' throughout Pasco. The Spanish speaker was caught on a witness's cellphone being gunned down by officers at a busy intersection, sparking outrage across  the United States and Mexico. It is the fourth fatal shooting by police in the city in the last six months and has caused heightened tensions within the community. Zambrano-Montes recently spent some time in a homeless shelter, authorities said Thursday. But investigators have been unable to interview anyone who saw him in the two weeks leading up to his death, Lattin said. In addition, officers are seeking to learn if Zambrano-Montes had mental problems, Lattin said. 'His actions were not normal,' Lattin said. 'It was not reasonable behavior. We want to know why.' In response to questions about whether the special investigative team could be objective in evaluating Pasco officers' conduct, Lattin was emphatic: 'We are going to produce an impartial report. No investigators would put their careers in jeopardy for someone else.' Reaction: Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Pasco, Washington, to protest the death of Antonio Zambrano-Montes. He was shot and killed by police after allegedly throwing stones at them . Necessary: Family members and supporters have questioned why the 35-year-old wasn't shot in the legs and was instead dealt a fatal blow . Running away? Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, is captured on witness Dario Infante's cellphone just seconds before he is shot dead by police. He appears to be running away from officers in the Washington city of Pasco . Shooting: The orchard worker, who was born in Mexico, had allegedly been throwing rocks at police. He is pictured turning to face three armed officers as one holds up a flashlight and two others draw their guns . That wasn't good enough for Felix Vargas, a Pasco business leader who has asked the federal government to conduct its own probe of the shooting. 'We want a separate set of investigatory eyes to come to Pasco,' Vargas said. He said it's inappropriate for authorities from such a close jurisdiction to be investigating a case that has drawn nationwide attention. Pasco police say Zambrano-Montes hit two officers with rocks and refused to put down other stones. In a cellphone video from a witness, several 'pops' are audible just before Zambrano-Montes is seen running across a street, pursued by three officers. As he stops and turns around, gunshots ring out, and he falls dead. Lattin said investigators have determined all three officers involved discharged their weapons. But he couldn't say how many bullets were fired. He added it was unclear from the video if Zambrano-Montes had anything in his hand when he was shot. The three officers are on paid administrative leave. None of them was wearing a body camera, Lattin said. But authorities are looking at dash cam video from patrol cars. Investigators have interviewed about 40 people, but only a few actually saw the shooting. Killed: Zambrano-Montes is seen lying on the ground after he was shot by police on February 10 . Protesting: Protesters gather at the corner where the shooting of Zambrano-Montes took place . Lattin also said it was not yet clear if Zambrano-Montes was in the country legally, but that it didn't matter as far as investigators were concerned. 'We treat all individuals the same regardless of any legal status that they may have had,' investigators said in a release. The special investigations unit does not include officers from Pasco, a southeast Washington town of about 70,000. More than half of Pasco's population is Hispanic. The killing was the fourth by Pasco police in less than a year and has led to protests. Officers were exonerated after similar investigations in the first three cases. Critics in the latest case say the officers should have used less than lethal force to subdue Zambrano-Montes. Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant, who ultimately will decide if charges are brought against the officers, said the victim's family has requested a private autopsy. He also said witnesses who might be in the country illegally can speak with investigators without fear of being deported. The investigation is likely to take months, and Lattin urged calm. 'We appreciate the patience of the public,' he said. Memorial: Pasco residents, pictured from left,  Angel Morgan, five, and his brother Jose Morgan, six, and Alex Gonzalez, four, and his brother Angel Gonzalez, eight, gather around a candlelit vigil on February 11 . Scene: Police investigate the scene of the shooting at the intersection of 10th Avenue and Lewis Street . The death of Zambrano-Montes is the fourth fatal police shooting since last summer in Pasco. It has sparked protests after witnesses said he was running away when he was shot in a busy intersection. Witness Ben Patrick told the Tri-City Herald that police fired at the man as his back was turned. 'I really thought they were just going walk up and tackle or Taser him,' he said. 'But they opened fire. His back was turned.' Patrick's wife, Shannon, also said the man was running away. The shooting happened in front of her young children. 'He turned around to take off running and the cops just shot him,' she said. Other witnesses heard officers give Zambrano-Montes orders to stop and drop the rock. They said the man refused to listen. Zambrano-Montes, who was raised in Michoacan, Mexico, has lived for about a decade in Pasco, where more than half of the residents are Hispanic. He died of gunshot wounds to the torso. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday reiterated his country's 'condemnation of the disproportionate use of lethal force' by members of the Pasco police against a Mexican citizen. 'I have directed the secretary of foreign relations to support his family so they feel the backing and support of the government of Mexico, so they don't feel alone and so there is a close monitoring of the investigation into this regrettable and outrageous occurrence,' he said at a gathering of members of the foreign diplomatic corps in Mexico City. Zambrano-Montes was not armed with either a gun or a knife, Lattin confirmed at the news conference, but whether he had a rock in his hand when he was shot is still under investigation. Paying tribute: Laura Alvarado, who says she knew Zambrano-Montes, lights a candle next to Vinny's Bakery . Zambrano-Montes had a run-in with Pasco police early last year, having been arrested for assault after throwing objects at officers and trying to grab an officer's pistol, court records show. Lattin cautioned the public that the inquiry will take at least weeks and that any decision on whether to bring charges against the three officers involved will be made by the Franklin County prosecutor. The officers are on paid administrative leave. 'Those three officers are going to have to live by their decisions,' Lattin said. 'Was it right? That will come out later on.' Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant said it was too early to speculate about what charges potentially could be brought against the officers. 'Rest in peace': Melted candle wax, a rock and roses are part of an impromptu memorial for  Zambrano-Montes on the sidewalk in Pasco, Washington . The Pasco police department also is conducting an administrative investigation of the shooting and could punish the officers if they find they disobeyed department procedures of policies. Local officials have been in contact with state and federal officials, who are observing the local criminal investigation and decide later whether any further action needs to be taken, Lattin said. Zambrano-Montes' family's $2 million damages claim was filed by his widow and two daughters. It is a precursor to a lawsuit. The city has 60 days to respond. The group conducting the criminal investigation was formed in 2010 to look at any officer-involved criminal cases. This is the eleventh investigation they have conducted since then, Lattin said. In three previous fatal police shootings in Pasco, prosecutors cleared officers with the Pasco Police Department and a sheriff's deputy who was working on a regional SWAT team. One of the three officers involved in Tuesday's shooting was a defendant in a federal civil-rights lawsuit the city settled in 2013 for $100,000, according to court records. The lawsuit claimed Pasco officers were inadequately trained in the use of force and how to respond to street confrontations. Earlier this week, the ACLU of Washington also issued a statement, calling the incident 'very disturbing.' The group's executive director, Kathleen Taylor said: 'Fleeing from police and not following an officer's command should not be sufficient for a person to get shot,' She added deadly force should be used only as a last resort.","Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, shot dead by police on February 10 .

'Everything is ready for execution - we are waiting for them': The 'death island' prisons boss Ahmad Yuspahruddin (pictured), chief of the Central Java penitentiary division which governs Nusakambangan Island is prepared to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Children play in the water across from 'death island' or Nusakambangan (pictured, in the background) this week in central Java, where preparations have intensified for the arrival of Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan to be placed in isolation cells and then executed by firing squad . Deathly business: At Java Christian church in Cilicap, the port to Nusakambangan Island, Suhendro Putro prepares coffins. The bodies of the condemned prisoners who are executed on the island are placed in the coffins before their remains are returned to their families following a post mortem examination . Death island tour: It was business as usual at Cilicap where tourists (pictured) waited for a boat to tour Nusakambangan Island where Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are due to be executed . Point of no return: Sodong port on Nusakambangan Island is the entry gate to the prison complex  which houses drug smugglers, murderers and convicted Islamic terrorists in six correctional facilities including Batu Penjara, built by the Dutch in 1925, and the final destination of the Bali 9 duo . With the Nusakambangan prison island looming in the background, a boy swims at Wijaya port in Cilicap, central Java, where condemned prisoners including the Bali 9 duo, Australians Chan and Sukumaran, are due to be transported and executed .

Condemned men are shot on the beach or in the 'grove' in the island's centre . The police chief at the major port to the island, Cilicap police commander Ulung Sampurna Jaya, also confirmed the firing squad was 'ready at any time of instruction' to carry out the execution. 'We are only waiting of the instruction. We have already secured the entire area of Cilacap with our troops,' he said. 'We are preparing Batu Penitentiary to isolate the duo inmates, we still await from Kerobokan Bali, when they are ready,' Yuspahruddin said to journalists.

Chan and  Sukumaran were sentenced to death in February 2006, less than a year after being arrested attempting to smuggle from Indonesia to Australia 8.3kg of heroin valued at around $4 million strapped to the bodies of the young Australians who became known as the 'Bali 9'. The drug operation ringleaders appealed  to the newly elected Indonesian president Widodo last year to have their death sentences commuted to life, but he refused. An appeal against his decision is due to be heard on Tuesday.

The girl's angry parents added that their daughter had been left unattended when the agonising accident occurred. The tip of the young girl's finger (left) had to be surgically reattached and it will take the five-year-old (right) three months to recover . Surgeons operated on January 19 to try and reattach the severed tip of the finger but medics say it will take the girl three months to recover. Mrs Chan, who lives with her husband and two daughters, are now planning to withdraw their children from the school because of its handling of the situation. 'She got sent back into the school building toilet alone unsupervised via a classroom where there are two fire doors,' said the mother-of-two. 'One of which amputated her finger tip. We went to see the school to understand what had happened. 'No one could tell us as it was 'unwitnessed' was they all said.'

"Hospitals in England have failed to meet waiting time targets in A&E for five months running. The latest set of figures, published today, reveal the misery for patients is ongoing, with no sign of the mounting pressure on medical staff abating. NHS England said 91.6 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival in A&E to being admitted to hospital, transferred or discharged. The figures reveal performance for the week ending February 15 and is down from 92.9 per cent the previous week - short of the 95 per cent target. The damning statistics mark the 20th consecutive week that the A&E target has been missed. Hospital across England have failed to meet the A&E waiting time target for a 20th consecutive week, with just 91.6 per cent of patients spending four hours or less between arriving at A&E and being admitted, transferred or discharged - the target is 95 per cent. It comes as hospitals face massive demand . It came as the level of admissions reached its highest levels since the peak seen at Christmas. Across England, 420,700 patients visited A&E departments, up from 407,000 the previous week. Emergency admission were also up 107,200 from 105,500 the previous week, and up on the 104,500 weekly peak seen last year. More than 8,890 people had to wait more than four hours, up from 7,280 the previous week. Dr Barbara Hakin, national director of commissioning operations for NHS England, said: 'Last week saw a sharp increase in A&E attendances and emergency admissions - up by nearly 15,000 on the week before. 'These are the highest levels since Christmas and are also up on the same week last year. 'This has resulted in a slight impact on waiting times, but we continue to admit, treat and discharge more than nine out of 10 patients within four hours.' In the week leading up to Christmas, A&E departments saw an unprecedented peak of 446,473 attendances. In January figures released by NHS England revealed that from October to December last year A&E waiting times plummeted to the lowest levels recorded in a decade. In that time 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target. In January figures released by NHS England revealed that from October to December last year A&E waiting times plummeted to the lowest levels recorded in a decade . The latest performance marks the worst quarterly results since the target was introduced at the end of 2004. The Government  admitted the figures were 'disappointing' - and conceded there is a 'huge amount of pressure' on the health service. Speaking at the time Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said hospital bosses feel they are 'running just to keep still' to cope with rising demand. Meanwhile Prime Minister David Cameron said, at the time, much of the pressure on emergency departments comes as society faces an ageing population, with more frail, elderly people. But he insisted that around 2,500 more patients were being seen within four hours every day than four years ago.","91.6% of patients spent four hours or less from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge at A&Es across England in week ending February 15 .
Down from 92.9% recorded at hospitals in the previous week .
