"Since the dawn of the space age just a few hundred astronauts have joined an exclusive club of humans who have seen Earth from space. But now you too can join in the adventure thanks to cameras that were recently installed on the International Space Station (ISS). Nasa’s High Definition Earth Viewing (HDEV) experiment allows you to watch our planet live as the station hurtles around. Watch livestream below . The HDEV investigation placed four different commercial high definition cameras on the ISS. These were installed on the Columbus External Facility, two identical L-shaped consoles located outside the station in space that host a variety of experiments. Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 264 miles (425 kilometres). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000 kilograms) and has liveable space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600 kilometres) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,600 days, during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for over 13 years. While one of the stated goals of the mission is to assess the ability of such hardware to survive in the vacuum of space, the educational benefits are also plain to see. The experiment was launched on 18 April 2014 inside SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft before being installed outside the station on 30 April. Don’t be alarmed if the screen appears black sometimes – the ISS orbits the Earth approximately every 90 minutes, and about half of that time is spent in darkness while on the night side of Earth. There is also an occasional loss of signal, but otherwise the stream seems to be operating nominally. Students in the US helped design some of the cameras’ components through the High Schools United with Nasa to Create Hardware (HUNCH) programme. Teams of students are also responsible for operating the cameras from Earth as they transmit footage to the ground in real time. On 30 April the High Definition Earth Viewing (HDEV) experiment was installed outside the ISS on the Columbus External Payload Facility. The four cameras on the experiment, view out of one pictured here, stream live video of Earth from the ISS to the ground in real-time . The HDEV unit was taken into space by SpaceX's Dragon capsule on 18 April (top left). At the end of the month it was then removed from the rear 'trunk' of the spacecraft by the Dextre robotic arm on the station (bottom left) and then installed on the Columbus module (top right and bottom right) The cameras used are Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) cameras, which are fixed to the station with no zoom, pan or tilt mechanisms. One of the cameras points down towards Earth (nadir), one points forward in the direction the station is travelling and two look backwards (aft). The cameras aren’t quite exposed to the full harshness of space, however, as they are enclosed in a pressurised box containing dry nitrogen. As the ISS moves over Earth the cameras ‘track’ locations below by switching feeds. Only one camera is operational at any one time but they work in tandem. The forward camera is turned on for 138 seconds, before switching to the downwards camera for 85 seconds. The view then switches to the first rear camera for 133 seconds, which also has part of the solar array and two docking ports in its view, before jumping to the other rear camera for 112 seconds. Then the system resets for 15 seconds and switches back to the forwards camera, and the cycle starts again. If desired, ground controllers can choose to alter the cycle and switch to a different camera, though, if for example something of particular interest is spotted. The HDEV experiment is expected to remain operational until October 2015, so you’ll have plenty of time to continue watching Earth live from space. And later this year a separate endeavour known as Urthecast will be installed on the ISS, which will enable members of the public to zoom and navigate through a higher definition live stream of Earth. Urthecast say this will let people watch events on Earth unfold in real-time from space. As the ISS moves over Earth the cameras 'track' locations below by switching feeds. Only one camera is operational at any one time but they work in tandem as shown in this diagram. If desired ground controllers can choose to alter the cycle and switch to a different camera .","Nasa has installed four external cameras on the International Space Station .

"Tragic: Tameria Greene, pictured, was stabbed to death last week and her mother, Semeria, has been charged with her murder . A 26-year-old Detroit mother has been charged with brutally stabbing to death her daughter, just days before the girl's ninth birthday. The heartbreaking slaying comes after Michigan Child Protective services tried for two years to remove Tameria Greene and her four younger brothers from their mother's care, even petitioning the court as recently as November. Semeria Greene was charged on Wednesday with felony murder and first-degree child abuse and her four sons have been turned over to Child Protective Services, police spokeswoman Sgt. Eren Stephens said. Neighbors called police to the Greene family's apartment in the Martin Luther King block just east of downtown Detroit in the early hours of Sunday morning. When officers arrived at 2.42am, they found Tameria bleeding and unresponsive on the floor, having been stabbed in the chest, and recovered three bloodied kitchen knives that were scattered around her. The little girl was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead and Semeria Greene was taken into custody. The hospital told police Tameria also had bruises, possible bite marks and scratches on her face. 'This is only the second day of the year and we are charging a parent with a child homicide,' said Kym Worthy, county prosecutor. 'This case is made even more profoundly sad because today would have been Tameria's ninth birthday.' Semeria Greene's family don't believe she killed her daughter and claim police should be questioning Greene's allegedly abusive partner, Jovan Mull, who is the father of three of the boys. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Plea: Semeria Greene, pictured, has entered a not-guilty plea after she was charged with fatally stabbing her daughter . 'There's no way (Semeria was responsible). My sister did not even like to whoop her kids,' Tanisha Robinson told Fox 2 News. 'Jovan Mull, he should be arrested. He fled the scene of a crime,' she added. According to the Detroit Free Press, Greene told police her daughter had been making sandwiches in the kitchen when she heard a knock at the door. It's . unclear what happened next, but Greene said she then saw Tameria lying . dead on the living room floor. The police report says there was no . evidence the girl was making sandwiches. Greene had blood on her shirt and sock and was giving her daughter CPR when police arrived, according to reports. Police said she was uncooperative after her arrest, refusing to walk and pretending to fall asleep. They said her breath 'smelled of metabolizing alcohol.' According to the Free Press, . officers found a bloody knife by the sink in the house, a folding knife . on top of the refrigerator and a butcher knife between couch cushions. Failings: Michigan Child Protective Services attempted to remove Tameria, pictured, from her mother's care for two years but a court ruled against it . Gone: The little girl, pictured left with her mother Semeria, right, was found in a pool of blood with stab wounds, bruises and bite marks . They also found a dried blood shoe print in the dining room and dried . blood in the living room. Greene . had a bruise under her eye when police arrived at the apartment, which . relatives said may have occurred at the hands of her abusive partner. State child welfare workers have known . of problems with the family for at least two years and have . unsuccessfully tried to take Greene's children into protective custody, . said Michigan Department of Human Services Director Maura Corrigan. Support: The family of Semeria Greene, pictured, don't believe she killed her daughter and claim police should be questioning Greene's allegedly abusive partner, Jovan Mull . Corrigan said an expedited internal . review after the death showed that case workers have been trying to . protect the children and act on concerns raised by family, friends and . neighbors. 'Most recently, DHS petitioned the court on November 28, unsuccessfully, to remove Tameria and her siblings from her mother's home,' Corrigan said in a statement. It's not immediately clear why the court blocked the state's attempts to remove the children from Green's care. Corrigan said the department 'continued to provide court-ordered counseling services to the family as well as conducting in-home visits, the last of which occurred only two days before Tameria's death.' 'We share the grief felt by her loved ones and her community,' the woman said. Tameria's 7, 4, 2 and 1-year-old brothers now are in foster care. A motive for the stabbing was not clear. Neighbor Kimyatta Craigmiles told The Detroit News that she had earlier seen Greene arguing with a man in the complex's parking lot. According to the Detroit Free Press, . police had contact with Greene over allegations of child abuse and . neglect, as well as the previous visits from Children's Protective . Services. Greene . had taken Tameria to Children's Hospital of Michigan in October with . bruises on her body and told hospital officials an incident had occurred . at school, a report said. Neighbors noted how the mother would leave her children alone at times and was abusive. She had reported checked her self into a mental health clinic in the past. Memorial: Family and friends tied balloons on the door step of the Greene's home at the Martin Luther King Apartments, in Detroit, after the stabbing . Emotional: Relatives break down at a candlelight vigil for Tameria Greene, pictured . Court records show that Greene's sister was given guardianship of Tameria and at least one of her brothers in 2007, but they were returned to their mother in January 2008. Minister Craig Fuqua Bey, who will be conducting Tameria's funeral service next week, told the Free Press Greene was a loving mother. 'She loved her children,' he said, 'and her children loved her.' Neighbors adorned the family's porch and front door at the Martin Luther King Apartments with balloons and stuffed animals in the girl's memory. Greene is scheduled to be arraigned this afternoon and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole if convicted of murder. The child abuse charge carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence. Fox 2 News Headlines .

"Nigel Farage was last night at the centre of a new racism storm over shocking remarks made by UKIP officials about Nelson Mandela and the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence. One mocked Mr Lawrence as ‘Saint Stephen’ and said his grieving mother was ‘boring us all to tears’. Another, writing just days after Mandela’s death, said that some ‘base-born’ people were ‘intended by nature’ to be ‘slaves’. Sickening: UKIP members made comments about Nelson Mandela (left) and Doreen Lawrence, mother of the murdered Stephen, in posts on an internal party forum . Opponents said that the remarks – made on an internal party forum used by senior figures, including party leader Mr Farage – revealed the ‘true face’ of the party. Some of the most shocking messages concerned Mr Lawrence, who was killed in a racist attack in South London in 1993. Pamela Preedy, secretary of UKIP’s Redcar branch, wrote: ‘The image of Stephen Lawrence has been promoted to sainthood, with his own memorial site, constant invocation of his name in any discussion of racism; even to close down a discussion about immigration when the issue bore no relevance to his murder’. Disrespectful: Pamela Creedy, the secretary of UKIP's Redcar branch, referred to the murder victim as 'Saint Stephen' Ms Preedy then accused David Cameron of ‘worshipping at the shrine of Saint Stephen’, complaining that ‘we are supposed to publicly mark the anniversaries of his death .  .  . Please give it a rest!’ Ms Preedy added in the message, left last year: ‘I’m sure his mother still grieves for him, but it’s time she did it privately without setting him up as some kind of media icon. She risks .  .  . boring us all to tears.’ Another contributor to the forum, Keith Woods, a UKIP council election candidate, commented as part of the same exchange: ‘As for St Stephen of Racism, I feel sorry for the parents of many white youths that have been murdered .  .  . no one seems to give a toss .  .  . your son gets murdered, you become an expert on race relations it seems .  .  . but only  if you are a particular colour’. The death of former South African President Nelson Mandela last month prompted some UKIP members to discuss whether it was ‘time for a reappraisal’ of the reviled apartheid system. David William Griffiths, a member of UKIP’s West London branch, used the site to argue that some people were ‘intended by nature’ to be slaves and were ‘marked out for subjection’ from birth. He went on to quote selectively from Hindu literature to argue that a ‘base-born man’ can ‘never conceal his real nature’. He concluded with the offensive line: ‘That kingdom in which such b*******, sullying [the purity of] the castes, are born, perishes quickly together with its inhabitants.’ The word b******* has been removed from the quote, on the grounds that it was ‘offensive language’ which had been ‘auto-deleted’. Other postings appear to confirm the claims of UKIP’s opponents that many of its activists back the policies of openly racist far-Right groups such as the British National Party (BNP) and the English Defence League (EDL). One councillor, who uses the online name Icini123, boasted: ‘Some individuals who voted for BNP in desperation, because there was no other alternate where we didn’t stand, have come over to us now.’ Outrage: Veteran anti-apartheid campaigner Peter Hain said the comments showed 'the true face of UKIP' Martin Caine, a UKIP committee member in Poole & Mid Dorset, wrote: ‘I actually agree with the EDL on what they protest about.’ And Alexander Monk, a UKIP member from Lowestoft, said: ‘What really grinds my gears about it is people are declaring the EDL as “extremist” which is tosh in my eyes.’ And in a message earlier this month, Brian Otridge, who is a campaign manager for UKIP’s North West Hampshire Branch, declared UKIP should be directly targeting BNP voters in the wake of their leader, Nick Griffin, being declared bankrupt. New force: Mr Farage vowed to start a campaign for the 2015 General Election to ¿pick off¿ vulnerable seats, including several held by Labour . Noting that the BNP received hundreds of thousands of votes in the 2010 General Election, Mr Otridge said: ‘We should be picking up 50-75 per cent of those now.’ Last night, veteran anti-apartheid campaigner Peter Hain said: ‘This is the true face of UKIP. Under their thin veil of respectability lurks rampant bigotry and prejudice, fed by disenchantment and feelings of social injustice. ‘None of these comments surprise me, because whenever I speak out about apartheid I am bombarded with bigoted and quasi-racist tweets from UKIP supporters.’ Last month this newspaper revealed that Victoria Ayling, an ally of Mr Farage, had been captured on video saying of immigrants: ‘I just want to send the lot back.’ Mr Farage vowed yesterday to start a new targeted campaign for the 2015 General Election to ‘pick off’ vulnerable seats, including several held by Labour. He declared: ‘This party feels itself to be a new force in British politics. The goal is to get enough representation in Westminster to make the difference.’ Last night, commenting on the forum posts, a UKIP spokesman said: ‘UKIP does not endorse any of the comments made on this forum which go against the party’s principles and core values. ‘However, the party does not police open discussions. Where elected representatives or party figures make comments bringing the party into disrepute, we act accordingly.’","Controversial remarks were made on the party's internal online forum .

The signing of Valdes will inevitably lead to more talk about De Gea’s future. United have not been able to get the young Spaniard’s name on a new contract and Real Madrid are keen to have the 24-year-old as a long-term replacement for Iker Casillas. Valdes is currently living in the Lowry Hotel in the city centre but is believed to be looking for property in the same area as his compatriots De Gea, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera.

"Retiring judge Mary Jane Mowat, 66, said the rape conviction rate would not improve 'until women stop getting so drunk' A top female judge has criticised rape victims who drink too much and are unable to remember their attack clearly. In a controversial interview to mark her retirement, Judge Mary Jane Mowat said the rape conviction rate would not improve until women stop drinking so heavily. She also branded the automatic release of prisoners halfway through their sentences as ‘the biggest fraud on the public ever’. Judge Mowat admitted she expected to be ‘pilloried’ for linking drunkenness with rape, and last night her views were branded ‘outrageous, misguided and dangerous’ by campaigners. During 18 years as a circuit judge in Oxford – where the rape conviction rate is well below the national average – the 66-year-old has on occasion attracted criticism for her handling of sex offence cases. In one, she spared a former Guardsman jail for having sex with a 13-year-old girl after saying the teenager had ‘made most of the running’. The Oxford-educated judge claimed the national rape conviction rate after trial of just 60 per cent is largely due to the lack of corroborative evidence. ‘It is an inevitable fact of it being one person’s word against another and the burden of proof being that you have to be sure before you convict,’ she said. ‘I will also say, and I will be pilloried for saying so, but the rape conviction statistics will not improve until women stop getting so drunk. ‘I’m not saying it’s right to rape a drunken woman, I’m not saying for a moment that it’s allowable to take advantage of a drunken woman. Judge Mowat, who sat at Oxford Crown Court, pictured, during her 18 years as a circuit judge, told the Oxford Mail that she sat in back-to-back rape trials where the victim was too drunk to remember what had happened . ‘But a jury in a position where they’ve got a woman who says, “I was absolutely off my head, I can’t really remember what I was doing, I can’t remember what I said, I can’t remember if I consented or not but I know I wouldn’t have done”, I mean when a jury is faced with something like that, how are they supposed to react?’ In Oxford, only 24 per cent of rape trials result in conviction, according to the latest figures. In her interview with the Oxford Mail newspaper, Judge Mowat also condemned the automatic release on licence of prisoners halfway through their sentences as ‘fraud’, saying: ‘You get a three-year sentence and in fact it means only one-and-a-half years. ‘The public are beginning to wake up to it but it has been happening for years, quietly, without it ever being announced. It has been done to empty the prisons because they just haven’t got enough places in prisons, they are bursting.’ Natalie Brook, service manager at Oxford Sexual Abuse and Rape Crisis Centre, yesterday slammed the judge’s comments on rape as ‘an outrageous, misguided and frankly dangerous statement to make’. She said: ‘Rape convictions will improve when those who perpetrate it, who are disproportionately male, stop raping and when society stops blaming women for somehow being complicit in this act of violence. ‘Rape is 100 per cent the fault of the perpetrator.’ Responding to her comments on early prisoner release being ‘fraud’, a Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Judges and magistrates have a duty to clearly explain in open court how a sentence will be served and the reasons for it being imposed.’","Judge Mary Jane Mowat, 66, gives controversial interview as she retires .

"Five men held on suspicion of raping and murdering two teenage girls who were found hanging from a mango tree in India will not be charged with any offences, investigators said today. Young cousins, Murti and Pushpa, aged 14 and 15, were found dead in the village of Katra in northern Uttar Pradesh state in May this year. Their killings provoked national outrage after it emerged that police in the village initially refused to investigate due to the girls' low-caste status. Cousins Murti and Pushpa were found hanging from a mango tree in the village of Katra in northern Uttar Pradesh after going missing in May this year . Murti's grief-stricken father Sohan vowed to get justice for his daughter after police initially failed to investigate the girls' killings because of their low-caste status . Murti's mother, pictured, said she wanted the killers to be hanged in order to secure justice. But it emerged today that the five men held in relation to the killings will not be charged . The girls were reported to have been gang-raped and murdered after going into the fields to relieve themselves because their homes, pictured, like most villages in the district, did not have toilets . Three brothers, Pappu, Awadhesh and Urvesh - who are members of the dominant Yadav caste, to which most of the local police belong - were quickly arrested and later admitted attacking and killing the young girls. Two police officers were also arrested for allegedly ignoring the victims' parents when they reported that the girls were missing. But now the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India's top investigative agency, has said it would not 'as yet' file charges against the men. Announcing the news today, the CBI said there was a lack of evidence to carry out a prosecution. But a spokesman for the agency - which took on the case after it was initially investigated by state police - did not rule out future charges. Kanchan Prasad said: 'Based on our investigations so far, we are not going to file the charge-sheet at this stage. However, no one has been given a clean sheet as yet.' Police and locals had to guard the tree after the girls had been found. The investigation was initially led by state police but was moved to the CBI, India's top investigatory body . Bodyguards had to stand near the tree where the bodies of the two girls were found after riots broke out . Protests took place in the state, demanding the girls' killers be brought to justice . Despite the national outrage, one leading officer said the deaths could have been honour killings by the girls' families. A further investigation found there was no evidence of sexual assault . A woman protesting over the killings. India brought in tougher rape laws last year for crimes against women after the fatal gang-rape of a physiotherapy student on a bus in New Delhi in December 2012 . After they were found, the girls were reported to have been gang-raped and murdered after going into the fields to relieve themselves. They had gone to the fields because their homes, like most in their village in Badaun district, did not have toilets, their families said. A local post-mortem examination also confirmed multiple sexual assaults and death due to hanging. But when the case was handed over to the CBI, a forensic investigation into clothing and swabs concluded the girls were not sexually assaulted. Villagers watched on as police investigated into the death of the teenage cousins . At the time, locals said they were worried they would be targeted for retribution by the police and other high-caste people . India's Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) reported that it found no proof of sexual assault on the girls' clothes. Even before the CDFD report surfaced, regional police had cast doubt on whether the girls had been sexually assaulted. The head of police in the UP state instead suggested they could have been victims of so-called 'honour' killings. Anand Lal Bannerjee claimed only one of the cousins had been raped and they had in fact been strangled before their bodies were strung up on the tree. Women took part in a protest in New Delhi after the case caused outrage across all of India . Vigil: Several activists lit a candles on the Delhi pavement as part of memorial protests . He said: 'According to the postmortem report of the deceased, one of the girls was not raped and it appears to be a case of honour killing. We are probing the matter. 'We will conduct a lie detection test on all the accused who have been arrested. If needed, we will take the accused to Bangalore for the test and get the results.' The men are expected to be released on Friday after 90 days in detention, the maximum time that a person can be held without being charged in India. At the time, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said he was 'especially appalled' by the alleged rape and murder of the two girls. Their deaths led to protests in New Delhi and other Indian cities, in an echo of the outpouring of grief which came when a student was raped and killed on a bus in the capital in 2012.

"Police are seeking a gang of men, believed to be Chelsea fans, who were heard shouting racist chants at a London station. The incident, which took place at London St Pancras on Wednesday evening, happened the day after fans of the same football club allegedly pushed a black man off a Paris Metro train while shouting a racist chant. An investigation is currently under way after a member of the public reported the men, who had travelled by train from Paris Gard du Nord, to British Transport Police. A group of men were at St Pancras International station when they reportedly engaged in racist chanting .

Superintendent Gill Murray, of British Transport Police, said: 'The racist chanting was reported by a member of the public who was disgusted by the behaviour of the men who had travelled on the 6.40pm service from Paris Gard du Nord. 'The men shouted as they walked through the station having alighted from the train a short time earlier. 'If you travelled on the train from Paris or were at the station and have information which can assist our investigation I would urge you to get in touch as a matter of urgency.' Ms Murray continued: 'It's clear that unfortunately there is still a minority who think it is acceptable to behave in such an abhorrent manner.

The commuter, Souleymane S, has been invited to attend a game at Stamford Bridge by Mourinho . The news comes as police revealed they are seeking three more Chelsea football fans they believe were involved in Tuesday's allegedly racist incident on the Paris Metro train. Five people have so far been suspended from the club's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into the incident. Images have been released in a bid to identify the trio, who the Metropolitan Police think were among a group of Chelsea supporters who pushed a black man off the train and chanted a racist song while on the way to the Champions League match. Chelsea have reiterated a promise to ban for life anyone proved to have been involved in the altercation. It comes as the man pushed off the train, identified only as 33-year-old Souleymane, said the incident is the club's 'responsibility'. That incident was filmed by a passenger and brought widespread condemnation, from the United Nations to British Prime Minister David Cameron and FIFA President Sepp Blatter. A club spokesman revealed Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich  is 'disgusted' by the incident . Speaking of his ordeal, Souleymane told BBC Radio 5 Live Drive: 'I felt truly wounded to the bottom of my heart that I really couldn't believe it. Chelsea have said they are 'appalled' and apologised to the victim, while manager Jose Mourinho said he was 'ashamed' of the fans involved.

"A New Jersey college freshman died after collapsing while playing basketball in the second student death the university has seen this year. Rutgers University officials say that Patrick Awosogba, 18, of East Brunswick was playing basketball  when he collapsed at around 2pm Sunday at the Cook/Douglass Recreation Center. Lifeguards on duty and Rutgers EMT officials worked to resuscitate the teen using CPR and a defibrillator, according to NBC. Collapsed: Patrick Awosogba (photographed), 18, of East Brunswick was playing basketball when he collapsed at around 2pm Sunday at the Cook/Douglass Recreation Center . Awosogba was pronounced dead at about 3.15pm at New Brunswick's Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. A university spokesman said there is no indication of foul play and a cause of death has not been determined but the teen's sister, a resident physician in Boston, says her brother may have had an undiagnosed heart condition, FOX News reports. 'We don't know yet what happened,' she said. 'But based on what one of his friends told us, it seems to have been a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.'

Heart Condition: A cause of death has not been determined but the teen's sister (center), a resident physician in Boston, says her brother may have had an undiagnosed heart condition. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the heart muscles become abnormally thick, making it difficult for the heart to pump blood. The disease often goes undiagnosed because many with the disease show few, if any, symptoms, according to the Mayo Clinic. A common misdiagnosis is asthma. 'His friend told us he looked unwell, uncomfortable,' Temitope said. 'He went to get a drink of water, then collapsed.' Awosogba, known as 'BJ' or 'Banji' to his friends, played basketball and baseball throughout his childhood and teen years, He entered the university's School of Arts & Sciences in fall 2014, he did not have a declared major.

"It can fit in a pocket, yet is nimble enough to fly through windows and even through tunnels deep underground. Researchers have unveiled a radical new spy drone they say could revolutionise search and rescue. The US Air Force has even backed the project, hoping to use the drone to look for IEDs and for surveillance mission. Scroll down for video . The Pocket Flyer will carry a panoramic camera that provides both a 360-degree view from the drone. The tiny hexacopter, which measures about seven inches across when fully configured. The drone uses six rotors to keep it airborne. It has a 360 degree panoramic camera, and can operate when out of radio contact with operators. CyPhy Works, a Danvers, Massachusetts-based startup led by CEO (and iRobot co-founder) Helen Greiner will build the drone. The Pocket Flyer will carry a panoramic camera that provides both a 360-degree view from the drone. The tiny hexacopter, which measures about seven inches across when fully configured, will initially be used in search and rescue operations in collapsed buildings, tunnels, and other confined spaces and steep grades that may be difficult for crawling robots to negotiate. 'Just like a camera, the best drone is the one you have with you,' Greiner said. 'The market potential is one for every soldier, marine, police officer, SWAT team member, and many other jobs that expose people to danger.' It will also provide a way to search for improvised explosive devices and conduct surveillance of tunnels and other spaces without the use of radio frequency controls. Funded under the Rapid Innovation Fund, Extreme Access Pocket Flyer will address an existing capability gap in the remote inspection of small passageways and tunnels that are often – blocked by debris and rubble. The drone uses six rotors to keep it airborne. It has a 360 degree panoramic camera, and can operate when out of radio contact with operators. Under this new project, CyPhy Works will design and test Extreme Access Pocket Flyer, a compact, highly versatile drone that can be quickly deployed for remote inspection of collapsed structures. The current approach used by search and rescue operations relies on costly ground robots that can be limited by ground obstacles and steep terrain. Target users communities will include Pararescue, Special Forces and FEMA. Extreme Access Pocket Flyer will also be used as an airborne in-tunnel surveillance system, the firm said. 'Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), frequently placed in tunnels and culverts, are the predominant threat to our military forces' said Matt England, LTC and CyPhy Works Vice President of Government Systems. 'Imagine not having to get out of the protection of your armored vehicle and being able to closely inspect suspicious areas in a fraction of the time it currently takes. 'That's what Extreme Access Pocket Flyer will enable. 'Extreme Access Pocket Flyer makes use of CyPhy Work's proprietary microfilament technology to solve the mission life and non-line-of-site telemetry issues. 'A free flying vehicle this size would last less than twenty minutes and would lose communications when entering a building. 'By contrast, the Extreme Access Pocket Flyer will stay aloft as long as power is supplied from the ground and its batteries will be hot swappable.","Tiny hexacopter measures about seven inches .

"Jailed: Christopher Birch fled to Spain after being charged with raping his wife and indecent exposure to his step-daughter. He has been jailed for 15 years . A rapist who  forced his wife to have sex with him in front of her eight-year-old daughter has been jailed for 15 years after fleeing to Spain. Christopher Birch fled while on bail following his repeated attacks on Louise Birch over six years. During one incident, Louise's daughter Sophie O'Farrell had heard her mother's anguished screams and walked in the room - but her step-father brutally continued. However, when he was due to appear in court charged with rape and indecent exposure in May 2011, he never arrived - sparking a three-year manhunt. He was still at large seven months later when Louise died after an illness aged just 33 in December 2011. Today, Sophie, 18, has said she can 'finally rest' as Birch is jailed for 15 years for rape and indecent exposure to a child. Addressing her ordeal, Sophie, who has waived her right to anonymity, said: 'My bed was right up against her wall, you could hear it. 'If you can hear your mum screaming, then you're going to go in there. 'He [Birch] was stopping my mum from saying anything with his hand over her mouth. 'It's not like he stopped when I walked into the room. He just said ""it's ok we're just playing"". 'I was confused when I saw it. I knew it wasn't right. 'I said something the next morning and my mum said ""we were playing"". 'There was always something between us after that, and I do blame him for that. 'Now she's dead I can't regain that with her. That is upsetting because he's done that. He's ruined a lot of lives. 'It's hard to rekindle relationships when you know something so horrible has happened to someone.' Mr and Mrs Birch met in late 2004 and married in December 2005. After they split in 2007, he sent Sophie, then aged 13, pictures showing his genitalia. Sophie, of Waterlooville, Hampshire, said: 'It was vile. It sickened me. 'It was disgusting to think that he was meant to be a father to me. That was a big thing to me.' Police contacted the family in June 2010 while investigating a harassment case involving Birch, 34, formerly of Gosport, Hampshire. He was convicted of harassment and given a sexual offences order. They then told police of the rape and messages, and recorded video witness statements detailing the crimes. Birch was arrested again and charged with five counts of rape and two charges of causing a child to look at an image of sexual activity between 2004 and 2010. He was released on bail. But when his case came to Portsmouth Crown Court in May 2011, he did not appear. Police were forced to launch a manhunt after he was spotted fleeing the country on a Calais-bound ferry from Dover. Birch had previously denied raping Louise and sending the messages and a jury trial went ahead without him in May 2012. He was found guilty of two counts of rape and two counts of causing a child to look at an image of sexual activity. Scroll down for video . Ordeal: Sophie O'Farrell (left) and her mother Louise Birch (right) were traumatised between 2004 and 2010 . The jury found him not guilty of three counts of rape charges. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in his absence. He was brought back to this country last month after being found by the Spanish authorities after a European arrest warrant was issued earlier this year. Sophie said giving evidence in court was traumatic and she was unable to move on knowing Birch was still free. Sophie added: 'I think he was trying to say he hadn't done it - if he hadn't then why run away? 'If that hadn't have happened, we wouldn't be here three years down the line. 'I could've moved on with my life. I'm happy that he's finally going to see justice for what he's done. 'It will put it to rest. Now he's in prison I know where he is.' While he was at large, Louise became seriously ill and underwent a kidney transplant and had her leg amputated before her death. Sophie's maternal grandmother Linda O'Farrell, 58, said she was pleased justice had been served. She said: 'My daughter and granddaughter have got their justice now.' 'I can finally rest': Sophie, now 18, spoke of her relief at Birch's sentencing and her grief that her mother could not live to see him jailed . Birch was sentenced to another seven months in prison at Portsmouth Crown Court last week for failing to surrender. Judge Sarah Munro QC said it was 'hard to imagine a more serious offence'. Judge Munro said: 'The decision you made to abscond led to delays in the trial process and vast expense as the police tried to locate you. 'In absconding yourself you looked to avoid a conviction. Your wife was alive but very ill when the process started. 'It's hard to imagine a more serious offence of this kind. There must be an additional penalty.' The seven months will run consecutively from his 15-year sentence handed to him previously. Judge Munro added his escape to Spain knocked public confidence in the justice system and was a drain on resources. Unyime Davies, mitigating, said Birch said he was remorseful, and disappeared because he was 'simply scared'. Birch previously exposed himself to schoolgirls, jumping out of bushes with his pants around his ankles while performing a sex act. It left women and girls scared to walk alone, sparked an undercover police operation and saw him branded the 'Gosport Flasher'. Birch was found guilty of indecent exposure and given 180 hours community service in April 2005. He was convicted of three counts of outraging public decency and three counts of indecent exposure between April 1 and June 16 in 2004. He had admitted the offences in police interview but then tried to claim he was just urinating. Sophie said she didn't know if her mother knew of the case.","Christopher Birch repeatedly attacked his wife Louise over six years .

"Raunchy music videos similar to Miley Cyrus's famous Wrecking Ball and Britney Spears' B**** could be censored as officials clamp down on sexual content. Addressing fears of the public, the British Board of Film Classification could now call for some music videos to be shown only after the watershed because of 'special worries' about the material being shown. Only yesterday BBFC announced plans to change film classification so that children as young as 15 could watch feature films filled with obscenities. Raunchy music videos, such as Miley Cyrus's Wrecking Ball, are set to be clamped down on in the UK . Another artist whose videos are likely to be affected by the crack down is Rihanna, seen here in Pour It Up . The vow to crack down on the videos came as the BBFC released a report stating that parents are losing control over what their children watch. Citing the increasing use of tablets, phones and computers, the body warned that children are able to watch violence and pornography without their parents knowing. As the Daily Mail highlights today, the body noted that swear words are now so ‘commonplace’ among teenagers that it made the decision to relax age ratings. The British Board of Film Classification claims parents accept it is ‘game over’ when protecting their children from bad language. Separately, it noted: ‘A specific . issue highlighted by the consultation is in relation to sexual content, . where the public is particularly concerned about the sexualisation of . girls, and pornography. ‘The content of music videos and the ease of accessibility of online porn are special worries.’ It also said the ‘sexualisation of young girls was of particular concern’. ‘Music . videos were identified as a key source of sexual imagery, which parents . believed to be potentially harmful to young girls’ emotional wellbeing . and social development,’ the report said. ‘The overwhelming reaction to the music videos content was one of shock and incredulity.’ Britney's Work B**** has been restricted in France on the grounds that it shows 'a sadomachistic universe representing women in a way that risks shocking many viewers' Rihanna came in for criticism from her own fans for this music video, which she released in October . Last week, music videos featuring Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears were banned by France's broadcasting watchdog before 10pm. The CSA said that Miley's Wrecking Ball and Britney's Work B**** must be shown when more 'adult' programming is on. The ban will do little to deter the . singers, however, as Miley's video became the most viewed on YouTube in . 24 hours when it was released in September last year, generating . 12.5 million hits. It currently has more than 475 million views. Despite . its popularity the clip drew concern from fellow songstress Sinead . O'Connor after Miley said she was inspired by her 1990 Nothing Compares 2 . U video. Veteran performer O'Connor penned an . open letter to the younger singer, urging her 'don't let the music . industry make a prostitute of you'. She . wrote: ‘I am extremely concerned for you that those around you have led . you to believe, or encouraged you in your own belief, that it is in any . way ""cool"" to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos. 'It . is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing . yourself to be pimped, whether it’s the music business or yourself doing . the pimping. ‘Nothing but harm will come in the . long run, from allowing yourself to be exploited, and it is absolutely . NOT in ANY way an empowerment of yourself or any other young women, for . you to send across the message that you are to be valued (even by you) more for your sexual appeal than your obvious talent.’ Last week, Miley's Wrecking Ball video was banned in France before 10pm on television . Beyonce, seen here in her video for Partition, could also be affected by the proposed crack down . Britney's raunchy offering, which was released in October, has drawn more than 70 million viewers online. Her video was also reportedly banned from UK music channels before 10pm at the time of release, with broadcasters asking for a clean edit to go along with the much-censored Work version of the song. Meanwhile, in October Rihanna faced an extraordinary . backlash after her own fans branded one of her videos . ‘obscene’, ‘vile’ and ‘pornographic’. Hundreds . took to social networking sites to tell the singer that she should be . ashamed of herself over the X-rated images in Pour It Up. They questioned whether she was fit to be a role model to her millions of young and impressionable fans.The BBFC spoke to more than 10,000 people from across the UK between December 2012 and throughout 2013 for the report.","Videos by artists such as Rihanna and Miley Cyrus are likely to be targeted .

"Nothing says ‘mood-killer’ like having to ask a judge for permission to sleep with your partner, even if it is a soon-to-be-divorced partner. But that is just what couples will have to do if the S787 legislation is passed in Massachusetts. The bizarre bill proposes that couples that are going through a divorce and have children must seek a judge’s permission before having sex in their marital home. No sex before divorce! A proposed bill in the State of Massachusetts wants spouses who are divorcing, and have children, to abstain from having sex or any sort of romantic date without permission from a judge . Not only that, couples on the brink of divorce won’t even be able to go on a dinner date with each other until their divorce is finalised. The bill bans any sort of romantic gestures between the two separating people that has not been pre-approved by the judge. In the current State law, there is a 120 day waiting period for an uncontested no-fault divorce. Republican senator Richard Ross proposed the bill S787 in Massachusetts on behalf of a loyal voter who had gone through a difficult divorce . Otherwise, the entire process should take less than six months. Massachusetts also permits fault divorces, which have a residency requirement of 1 year. Republican Senator Richard J. Ross wants to amend Massachusettes’ current divorce law to the following: . ‘In divorce, separation, or 209A proceedings involving children and a marital home, the party remaining in the home shall not conduct a dating or sexual relationship within the home until a divorce is final and all financial and custody issues are resolved, unless the express permission is granted by the courts.’ The bill was first proposed in early 2013, and it went through various hearings last week. On Thursday March 20, it received an extension for consideration in the State House until June 30, reports Think Progress. In a bizarre twist, Ross himself has claimed that the bill is, ‘going nowhere in the Legislature.’ He has hit back at criticism from the media, arguing that that he merely filed the bill at the request of a constituent, or loyal voter, who had gone through a difficult divorce. The senator even wrote on the bill, ‘by request,’ meaning he disagrees with it, but is filing it for a constituent. It’s not clear precisely what benefit the bill would have, what the penalty is for pre-divorce sex between spouses, or how the bill proposes to check up on such affairs.","State Sen.

"Syrian president Bashar Assad is hiding his chemical weapons outside the country to prevent the deadly arsenal being destroyed, a rebel leader has claimed. The dictator has been accused of moving his stockpiles across the border to Lebanon and Iraq to evade a possible inspection. His forces were said to have acted after the US and Russia agreed to secure and eliminate the weapons – a deal hailed by Assad’s regime as a ‘victory’. Scroll down for video . Mothers mourn during a symbolic Free Syrian Army funeral held in Aleppo today as the government welcomes a deal which seeks to destroy the country's chemical weapons . A mourning mother grieves the loss of her son at the funeral held in Aleppo today as conflict continues in the war-torn country . General Salim Idris, head of the .

We told them do not be fooled.’ He . criticised the deal for allowing Assad to escape being held to account . for killing hundreds of civilians, adding: ‘All of this initiative does . not interest us. Russia is a partner with the regime in killing the . Syrian people. ‘A crime . against humanity has been committed and there is not any mention of . accountability.’ His comments came after one of Assad’s ministers, Ali . Haidar, claimed the deal was a victory for the regime. He . said: ‘On the one hand, it helps Syria come out of the crisis and on . the other, it helps avoid war. It’s a victory for Syria.’ A government minister has praised . their 'Russian friends' for brokering the deal which seeks to destroy .

President and his government after shying away from military . intervention against al-Assad's regime. John Kerry however today sent a strong . warning to Syria, insisting 'the threat of force is real' if it does not . carry out an internationally-brokered agreement to hand over its . chemical weapons. The US Secretary of State issued the warning in Jerusalem, where he briefed jittery Israeli leaders on the new American-Russian plan to rid neighbouring Syria of its chemical weapons by mid-2014.

Agreement: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, shake hands yesterday after making a deal over Syria following three days of negotiations . Deadline: Syrian President Bashar Assad, pictured, is thought to hold about 1,000 tons of chemical agents and precursors, details of which must be handed over by September 21 . In comments aimed at his hosts, Mr . Kerry said the deal also served as a ‘marker’ for the international . community as it deals with Iran's suspect nuclear programme. ‘We cannot have hollow words in the conduct of international affairs,’ he added. The . US has been formulating its response to an alleged chemical attack . carried out by Syrian forces that killed hundreds of civilians last . month. 'We cannot have hollow words in the conduct of international affairs' US Secretary of State John Kerry . ‘These are crimes against humanity and they cannot be tolerated,’ Mr Kerry warned. In . a deal meant to avert a threatened US military strike, US and Russian . officials reached an ambitious agreement over the weekend calling for an . inventory of Syria's chemical weapons programme within one week. All parts of Syria's chemical weapons programme will be removed from the country or destroyed by mid-2014. The deal was greeted with cautious optimism in Israel, where leaders expressed satisfaction that Syria, a bitter enemy, could be stripped of dangerous weapons but also pessimism about whether Syrian President Bashar Assad will comply. Meeting: US Secretary of State John Kerry, second right, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, back to camera, talk, with their senior aides seated by a swimming pool at a hotel in Geneva, Switzerland . Israel has repeatedly voiced concern . that Assad, locked in a two-year-old civil war, may fire his chemical . weapons at Israel in a bout of desperation or that the weapons could . fall into the hands of Hezbollah or other hostile groups fighting in the . Syrian civil war. Perhaps . more critically, the Israelis also fear that a tepid international . response to Syria could encourage Iran to press forward with what is . widely believed to be a nuclear weapons program. Iran denies its nuclear programme has a military purpose and says it is pursuing peaceful applications like cancer treatment and power generation. Standing alongside Mr Kerry, Prime . Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the US-Russia deal and stressed his . belief that it would have deep repercussions on Iran, Syria's close . ally. ‘The world needs to . ensure that radical regimes don't have weapons of mass destruction . because as we have learned in Syria if rogue regimes have weapons of . mass destruction they will use them,’ Mr Netanyahu said. ‘The . determination the international community shows regarding Syria will . have a direct impact on the Syrian regime's patron Iran,' he . added. 'Iran must . understand the consequences of its continued defiance of the . international community by its pursuit toward nuclear weapons.'","A Syrian government minister said the agreement was a 'victory achieved thanks to our Russian friends'

"It's the picture that has broken the internet over the last 24 hours... is the dress white and gold, or blue and black? Celebrities far and wide have had their say, and now it's the turn of the professional footballer. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has weighed into the debate, in an Instagram video posted by the club's official account. This dress has sparked debate, with viewers disagreeing over the colour: blue and black, or white and gold?

Outraged, and perhaps echoing the thoughts of half the world, Toure says 'White and gold? How is it possible?', storming off. He turns again to shout his thoughts, but it's certainly a debate that has divided not just the nation, but further ashore too. Elsewhere at City, as shown in a video for the club's official YouTube channel CityTV, a number of the squad are divided, with Gael Clichy claiming that it's 'the big talk in the dressing room.' The former Arsenal defender is firmly in the black and blue camp, but revealed that David Silva and Samir Nasri had seen one combination, before changing their minds an hour later. Nasri, upon leaving the training ground on Friday, was asked his thoughts by the presenters, claiming 'now I see white and gold', while Pablo Zabaleta told the presenter to 'put some glasses on' when she disagreed with his view. Members of the Crystal Palace squad have also become embroiled in the debate, with midfielder James McArthur writing on Twitter: 'This colour of the dress picture is doing my head in. How can people see white and gold?', while striker Dwight Gayle claimed: 'This dress is starting to create a massive divide in the team. I'm adamant it's blue and black.' At Newcastle, the squad aren't sure. Rolando Arrons said: 'It's white and gold!! I'm tired of seeing this stupid dress', but Sammy Ameobi disagreed, claiming: 'This dress is black & blue right? Not white and gold!' Not one to involve himself in speculation, Carlton Cole is firm in his response: 'It don't matter if that dress is white/gold or black/blue its horrific anyway. Lol.' Elsewhere, pop sensations Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift have claimed it is blue and black, while the Sportsmail office is split 50/50.

"Ravel Morrison's tumultuous time at West Ham has officially come to an end after his contract was terminated by the club. It means the troubled 22-year-old, who has signed a pre-contract agreement with Lazio, is a free agent. However, the midfielder cannot represent another club this season as he has played in two countries - England and Wales - this term and FIFA don't allow a third. Ravel Morison has had his contract terminated at West Ham ahead of his summer move to Serie A side Lazio . Morrison (centre right) has not played for West Ham since their 3-1 defeat vs Southampton on August 31 . 'West Ham United can confirm that the Club have reached agreement with Ravel Morrison to terminate his contract with immediate effect,' a statement from the Upton Park outfit reads on their official club website. 'The 22-year-old midfielder joined West Ham in January 2012 and made 24 appearances in his three years at the Club, scoring five goals. 'The Hammers would like to wish Ravel every success in his future career.' Morrison only made two appearances under Hammers boss Sam Allardyce this season; with his last outing coming in a 3-1 home defeat to Southampton back on August 31. A series of disciplinary problems had hampered his progress at Upton Park and he was loaned to Birmingham, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff City - with his three-month deal at the latter cut short earlier in December.

"Amazon has bowed to pressure from animal welfare campaigners and decided to stop selling ‘cruel’ foie gras on its British website. The product, which comes from ducks and geese that are force fed to make their livers grow to a large an unnatural size, has been added to a list of prohibited items. It is highly prized by some food lovers and celebrity chefs, such as Gordon Ramsay, who have included it on their menus for many years. Scroll down for video . Setting a precedent: Amazon has taken an 'ethical lead' and delisted more than 100 foie gras products from its UK website following pressure from animal rights activists . However, earlier this year the animal welfare campaigners at the Viva! group petitioned Amazon to stop selling the delicacy on the grounds of the cruelty involved in its production. It presented Amazon with video evidence of the suffering caused by its production and a petition signed by over 10,000 opponents of the trade. The campaign followed an investigation in France which showed shocking images of force feeding at a farm that supplied products sold through Amazon. Footage from a farm belonging to a producer called Labeyrie showed distressing scenes of ducks being given huge amounts of grain with pneumatic pumps. Animal rights group Viva! launched a campaign to show Amazon how birds are treated at farms in France where some of its products originate . They lobbied Amazon with posters and video evidence that they say showed the products it was selling came from farms where birds were treated 'cruelly' These birds were seen in group cages where an automatic bar pins the ducks to the floor to prevent them avoiding being force fed. Production of foie gras is illegal in the UK as it would break existing animal welfare law, however it is not against the law to sell imported products. Before the ban, the UK Amazon Marketplace grocery section offered more than 100 products containing foie gras, including 75g cans for £15. Both Amazon and third party retailers sold the controversial food. Justin Kerswell, campaigns manager at Viva!, said: ‘Foie gras is mostly produced by imprisoning birds in cages so tiny they can’t move, by forcing a pipe down their throats and force feeding them until their livers swell to ten times their natural size. The birds were kept in small cages, with little room to move and force fed grain . The caged animals have no natural light and can barely move . ‘I can’t imagine why anyone would want to eat it – or be involved in its sale. It is quite simply torture in a tin. There is nothing humane about mechanically inducing disease in a bird.’ He described Amazon’s decision to stop selling it as ‘an incredible victory’ for anyone who cares about the welfare of animals. Mr Kerswell said: ‘Amazon should be congratulated for taking an ethical lead by delisting foie gras in the UK, but we hope that ethical stance is expanded worldwide. ‘This is a perfect example that consumer pressure does work, even with corporate giants such as Amazon. Amazon has now removed more than 100 products containing foie gras from its supplies . Praising the company, Justin Kerswell, campaigns manager at Viva!, said: ¿Amazon should be congratulated for taking an ethical lead by delisting foie gras in the UK, but we hope that ethical stance is expanded worldwide' ‘We will be extending our campaign to other online retailers, such as eBay. We must not lose sight of the fact that foie gras is a peculiarly un-British cruelty. ‘It would be illegal to produce in Britain and causes untold suffering to millions of birds every year in France and other countries that produce it.’ The organisation is calling on the UK government to ban imports. The campaign against foie gras, which also includes the PETA organisation, has gathered a host of celebrity backers, including Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Roger Moore and Brigit Bardot. Amazon did not respond to a request to explain why it had decided to ban the product. A spokesman said: ‘All sellers on Amazon.co.uk Marketplace must adhere to our guidelines in relation to the products that they make available for sale on our website.’","Animal rights group Viva! campaigned for Amazon to remove products .

The village began the exhibition 21 . years ago to attract tourists. This year two giant murals, depicting a . traditional Japanese courtesan and iconic Hollywood actress Marilyn .

As early as late 600s Japan there were female entertainers hosting gatherings, pouring sake and offering company to men. Known as 'saburuko' - translated as 'serving girls' - some of these women sold sexual services, while others simply hosted high-class occasions. And around 794 the culture of the geisha began to emerge: women who men would visit for romantic and sexual pleasure.

"Sports Direct has apologised after two schoolboys were barred from a store by a security guard who allegedly told them: ‘No Jews, no Jews’. The sports retailer removed the worker from its outlet in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire after he reportedly told the Year 7 students they could not enter. Both youngsters attend Yavneh College, a Jewish secondary school in the town, and were wearing their school uniform at the time. Scroll down for video . Sports Direct has apologised after two schoolboys were barred from its store in Borehamwood (pictured) by a security guard who told them: ‘No Jews, no Jews’ The guard has since been sacked by the security firm which supplies Sports Direct with workers. Sports Direct has described the guard’s behaviour as ‘deeply offensive and disrespectful’. David Rosen, the father of one of the 11-year-old boys, Nathan, told MailOnline: ‘My son was hugely offended, it was his first proper week at the school and he only went in to look at trainers. ‘He was in an anxious state afterwards and clearly upset,’ the lawyer added. ‘I wanted to get the story right and when I went through it with him he said “Daddy there is no question that he said ‘no Jews, no Jews’”. Mr Rosen, a partner at a London-based law firm, said Sports Direct had behaved ‘impeccably’ and removed the ‘rogue’ security guard. ‘They were swift to apologise and to deal with it,’ he said. David Rosen, right, said his son Nathan, left, was 'hugely offended' by the guard's comments .

"Food giants are being told to cut the amount of sugar they use because it has become the ‘new tobacco’. Doctors and academics say levels must be reduced by up to 30 per cent to halt a wave of disease and death. They found that even zero-fat yoghurts can contain five teaspoons of sugar, while a can of Heinz tomato soup has four. Doctors and academics say levels must be reduced by up to 30 per cent to halt a wave of disease and death . The equivalent of 11 teaspoons are found in a small Starbucks caramel Frappuccino with whipped cream. A Mars bar has eight. ‘Sugar is the new tobacco,’ said Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool. ‘Everywhere, sugary drinks and junk foods are now pressed on unsuspecting parents and children by a cynical  industry focused on profit not health. The obesity epidemic is generating a huge burden of disease and death. Obesity and diabetes already cost the UK over £5billion a year. Without regulation, these costs will exceed £50billion by 2050.’ Doctors found that even zero-fat yoghurts can contain five teaspoons of sugar, while a can of Heinz tomato soup has four . Professor Capewell is part of a new US-UK campaign group – Action on Sugar – that says asking firms to make voluntary changes has failed. The typical Briton consumes 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and some adults consume as many as 46.The maximum intake recommended by the World Health Organisation is ten, although this guideline is likely to be halved. The UN agency says there is ‘overwhelming evidence coming out about sugar-sweetened beverages and other sugar consumption’ being linked to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A study by Action on Sugar found surprisingly high levels of sugar in many foods, including savoury products and healthy options. The Pret a Manger Very Berry Latte with milk has 26.9g of sugar – the equivalent of seven teaspoons. Yeo Valley Family Farm 0% Fat Vanilla Yogurt has five. Sweet: A Mars bar has eight teaspoons of sugar while a tin of Heinz tomato soup has four . Even Glaceau Vitamin Water, which is owned by Coca-Cola, has the equivalent of four teaspoons of sugar in a 500ml bottle. Action of Sugar said food firms should be able to reduce the amount of sugar they add to products by 20 to 30 per cent within three to five years, taking 100 calories a day out of the typical diet. This would be enough to halt or even reverse rising levels of obesity and associated ill-health, it claimed. Graham MacGregor, a professor at the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine in London and chairman of Action on Sugar, said: ‘We must now tackle the obesity epidemic both in the UK and worldwide. ‘We must start a coherent and structured plan to slowly reduce the amount of calories people consume by slowly taking out added sugar from foods and soft drinks. ‘This is a simple plan which gives a level playing field to the food industry, and must be adopted by the Department of Health to reduce the completely unnecessary and very large amounts of sugar the food and soft drink industry is adding to our foods.’ Dr Aseem , the group’s science director, said: ‘Added sugar has no nutritional value whatsoever, and causes no feeling of satiety. ‘Aside from being a major cause of obesity, there is increasing evidence that added sugar increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and fatty liver. ‘We must particularly protect children from this public health hazard and the food industry needs to immediately reduce the amount of sugar that they are adding, particularly to children’s foods, and stop targeting children with massive advertising for high calorie snacks and soft drinks.’ But sugar manufacturers rejected the claims of the health experts saying they were not supported by the consensus of scientific evidence. Sugar Nutrition UK said the World Health Organisation published a review last year that found that any link between diabetes and body weight was due to overconsumption of calories and was not specific to sugar. It said: ‘There have also been numerous studies, which have investigated potential links between sugar and diabetes, with experts from the British Dietetic Association, European Food Safety Authority, and Institute of Medicine being very clear that diabetes is not caused by eating sugar. Respected expert committees have reviewed the evidence over many years and all have concluded that the balance of available evidence does not implicate sugar in any of the so-called lifestyle diseases.’ And Barbara Gallani, of the Food and Drink Federation, an industry group, also denied sugar was responsible for obesity. She said the industry already provided clear information on sugar levels to consumers, using figures and colour-coded labels. ‘Sugars, or any other nutrient for that matter, consumed as part of a varied and balanced diet are not a cause of obesity, to which there is no simple or single solution,’ she added. Professor Shrinath Reddy, a cardiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health and member of the WHO panel of experts, disputed this conclusion. He said there was ‘overwhelming evidence coming out about sugar-sweetened beverages and other sugar consumption links to obesity, diabetes and even cardiovascular disease’. Yoni Freedhoff, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa, said sugar needed again to become an occasional treat rather than a regular ‘crutch’. He said that added sugar had found its way into virtually everything we eat.","Doctors and academics say levels must be reduced by up to 30 per cent .

"New laws are to be drawn up to allow driverless cars to take to Britain’s roads. Ministers admit the current Highway Code and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles which pilot themselves. With technology being developed on both sides of the Atlantic, the government wants to ensure that Britain is not overtaken by Google’s drive to see its cars used legally on the streets of California. Scroll down for video . Google unveiled details of the world's first ever self-driving car, but legal changes will be needed before they can take to Britain's roads . Last month Google unveiled its computerised ‘hands-free’ self-driving bubble car, which has no steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals, just buttons for start, pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing your route. Google plans to have prototypes ready to test later this summer and says the goal is for the car to ‘shoulder the entire burden of driving’. A prize fund of £10million will soon be launched in the UK for a whole town or city to develop as a test site for consumer testing of driverless cars. Science minister David Willetts told MailOnline that he is already in talks with the Department for Transport about rewriting the law to allow cars on to UK highways without anyone in the driving seat. ’We are one of the world leaders in this,’ the Tory minister declared. Science minister David Willetts said he wanted to make sure Britain is not left behind in the race to get driveless cars on the road . A British version of a driverless is being developed in Oxford, but Google have so far clocked up more road miles with their version. ’There is British technology, and it's a lot cheaper than the Google technology,’ Mr Willetts said. ’But whereas the Google car, they have notched up more miles, so we have got to ensure that the British has its own opportunity to get tested in a wider range of environments and that's what we are working on with the department for transport. ’But the technology is being developed at Oxford as we speak.’ Even in the US self-piloting cars are only allowed on the roads if someone sits in the ’driver’s seat’. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as September. Mr Willetts said: ’You need a regulatory regime so that these are permitted. ’What America is going to have is a legal regime in California that permits you to travel in one without requiring someone in the so-called drivers seat. ’Certainly there are new regulations being drafted in California and obviously this is something I have discussed with the Department for Transport, we are aware of it. ’We need to work on these type of regulations so that as the technology develops in Oxford and elsewhere we can see them used.’ The government’s infrastructure plan commits to reviewing the law to ’ensure there is a clear and appropriate regime for the testing of driverless cars that supports the world’s car companies to come hand test them here.’ Britain will also benefit from recent changes to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic, which dates back to 1968. Driverless pods are already being used to transport passengers to Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport . It used to state: 'Every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals.' An amendment agreed last month would allow a car to drive itself, as long as the system 'can be overridden or switched off by the driver'. A driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time. The convention covers European countries, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Russia, although not the United States, Japan or China. Google says its prototype driverless car has been given a ‘friendly’ face to give a non-threatening appearance and help the public accept the new technology. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in a bid to be safer for pedestrians. Speed is restricted to 25mph and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles. This works by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights.","Technology is being developed in Britain to rival Google's driverless car .

"Shoppers are panic-buying powerful vacuum cleaners to beat an EU ban that comes into force next week. Last night retailers reported that sales had soared by nearly 50 per cent as consumers snap up any remaining stock in the run-up to the Brussels diktat outlawing machines of over 1,600 watts. Many stores and websites have already run out of the most powerful models, with one reporting its busiest day for sales in more than a decade. Scroll down for video . Stampede: Shoppers are panic-buying powerful vacuum cleaners to beat an EU ban coming into force next week. Above, some of models that will be affected by the ban . The buying frenzy looks set to intensify today and tomorrow, before the official ban on importing or manufacturing the machines takes effect on Monday. And Brussels is now considering measures to ban the most powerful hairdryers, lawn mowers and electric kettles, it was revealed. A list of up to 30 high-wattage household devices could be banned next spring following a draft EU report which examined ways to reduce power consumption. Consumer magazine Which? said the new rules on vacuum cleaners would outlaw some of the best machines, which owe their strong suction ability to their high power consumption. A previous story on the Brussels ban, as reported in the Mail on August 23, 2014 . From September 1, companies will be prohibited from manufacturing or importing any vacuum cleaners above the 1,600-watt limit as part of a drive to reduce domestic electricity use. Tesco yesterday said it saw sales rocket by 44 per cent over the past two weeks as panicked customers rushed to get their hands on popular 2,000-watt models. The Cooperative Electrical shop reported a rise of 38 per cent, while at Currys some models of powerful vacuums were sold out. Online electrical retailer ao.com said sales were up 40 per cent last week compared with the same period last year and last Friday it had its best ever day for vacuum cleaner sales in the 14 years it has been trading. Tesco planning manager Louise Rix said: ‘The EU ban has been a much debated topic over the last few days – it’s certainly provoked a lot of interest amongst consumers and manufacturers. ‘We’ve seen huge sales increases of vacuums and we expect the high demand to continue over the next two days before the ban comes into place.’ The ban from Monday on powerful vacuum cleaners has angered manufacturers, who say it will do nothing to make machines more environmentally friendly and will simply reduce efficiency in the home. Critics say cleaners satisfying the new rule may use less power but householders will have to use them for longer – so they are likely to use the same amount of electricity in the long run. For the first time, vacuum cleaners will have to carry ratings from A to G for energy use, cleaning performance on carpets and hard floors, and dust emissions. Measures: The buying frenzy looks set to intensify today and tomorrow, before the official ban on importing or manufacturing powerful vacuum cleaners (left) takes effect on Monday. And Brussels is now considering measures to ban the most powerful hairdryers, lawn mowers (right, file picture) and electric kettles, it was revealed . Yesterday, there was evidence that consumers are stockpiling their favourite models to use in the decades to come. Chris Wesson, posted a photograph on Twitter of two 2,000-watt Panasonic vacuums which he said his mother had bought. He tweeted the comment: ‘Only my mum would stock up on powerful vacuum cleaners before this ban comes into effect. We now have five in our house...’ But Leanne Beswick, of ao.com, said there was no need to panic buy – and that lower wattage does not necessarily equate to a poorer performing machine. ‘We have seen a significant surge in sales of corded vacuums over 1600 watts over the weekend as the deadline for meeting new EU legislation looms on September 1,’ she said. ‘However, consumers need not panic buy. Consumers are snapping up any remaining stock in the run-up to the diktat outlawing machines of over 1,600 watts. Above, the European Commission's headquarters . ‘Even though these particular models will eventually be off the market, this doesn’t mean that new and other existing models are any less effective – they are not. Although they may need to lose power to conform to the new regulations, they won’t lose performance.’ A Currys & PC World spokesperson said: 'We still have a good stocks of high powered vacuum cleaners at great prices. We will however be adding new products to our range with the best technology that adhere to the new energy and performance ruling. 'These new ranges are built with state of the art engineering with the same high standards to ensure customers reap the benefits without compromising quality.' While the ban comes into place on Monday, retailers will still be able to sell their remaining stock after this date. Last week consumer watchdog Which? warned that many of the best models that appear in its Best Buy tables will be taken off the market as a result of the new EU rule. Of seven awarded ‘Best Buy’ status since January 2013, five have motors with a power of more than 1,600 watts, it said. The maximum wattage will be lowered further to 900 watts by 2017. Current cleaners have an average wattage of 1,800. Which? said: ‘If you’re in the market for a powerful vacuum, you should act quickly, before all of the models currently available sell out. A best buy 2,200-watt vac costs around £27 a year to run in electricity – only £8 more than the best-scoring 1,600-watt we’ve tested.’ Marlene Holzner, the European Commission’s energy spokesman, said the amount of wattage does not automatically indicate how well a vacuum will perform. She added what counted was how efficiently a vacuum translated its electrical power into picking up dust, and this would be measured under the new rules.","Shoppers are panic-buying powerful vacuum cleaners to beat European Union ban that comes into force next week .

"Tyra Banks is known for two things: being one of the world's most famous supermodels and inventing 'smizing' - or the act of smiling with your eyes. But one photographer is hoping to give Tyra a run for her money with what he claims is 'the most incredible tip for looking photogenic' - the Squinch. Portraitist Peter Hurley claims the squinch is . the act of squinting your eyes in such a way as to ooze confidence . and self-assuredness. Does it really work? Portraitist Peter Hurley thinks that 'squinching' (R) makes you look more photogenic . He believes that this will make you look far more attractive than staring wide-eyed into the camera, which portrays fear and uncertainty. So how can you squinch without looking constipated? Firstly, Hurley emphasises that squinching isn’t the same as squinting and while the difference may be minor, it is vital. When you squint, your top and bottom eyelids close, which, Hurley believes makes you look far from confident. Before and after: He believes his trick (R) will make you look far more attractive than staring wide-eyed into the camera (L), which, he says, portrays fear and uncertainty . More photogenic after? The trick is to lift and tighten the lower eyelid and only allow the top eyelid to come down slightly (R) When you ‘squinch,’ however, you’re lifting and tightening the lower eyelid and only allowing the top eyelid to come down slightly. Speaking in his video, he says: 'If you're a photographer out there, make your people squinch. And if you're a human being who just wants to look hot, this is going to do it for you.

The last time Hurley, a New York and Los Angeles based photographer specialising in advertising and commercial work, unveiled a tutorial on how to look picture perfect by accentuating your jawline, it went viral. He showed viewers how to accentuate the jawline by showing their good side, avoid laughing, titling their head and locking eyes with the camera - and it got over a million hits.

"A rabbi at one of Washington D.C.'s most prominent synagogues has announced that he is gay and divorcing his wife of 20 years. Rabbi Gil Steinlauf, who has three teenage children with wife Batya, herself a rabbi, sent the email to members of Adas Israel Congregation on Monday. He said that Batya has long known about the feelings he has battled since he was young. 'I am writing to share with you that after twenty years of marriage, my wife Batya and I have decided to divorce,' he announced in the email, shared by the Washington Post. 'We have arrived at this heartbreaking decision because I have come to understand that I am gay.' Revelation: Rabbi Gil Steinlauf, left, has announced that he is gay and is divorcing his wife, Batya, right . Steinlauf, 45, explained that he has realized that he can continue 'with the greatest strength, with the greatest peace in my heart' by finally acknowledging his sexuality. 'Sadly, for us this means that Batya and I can no longer remain married, despite our fidelity throughout our marriage and our abiding friendship and love,' he wrote. He said that he had hoped to marry a woman when he was younger because he believed it was the right thing for him, and that he fell madly in love with Batya after they met at rabbinical school. 'We have shared a love so deep and real, and together we have built a loving home with our children--founded principally on the values and joys of Jewish life and tradition,' he wrote. Side-by-side: The couple, who are both rabbis, have been together for 20 years and have three children . Support: In an email to the congregation, Steinlauf praised his wife for her support through his struggle . 'But my inner struggle never did go away. Indeed, Batya herself has supported me through this very personal inner struggle that she knew to be the source of great pain and confusion in my life over decades.' He added to the Washington Post that he and his wife had worked for the past three years to try to figure out how they could stay together. 'What we've had for 20 years is very real, and the last thing I'd want is for us to live a lie,' he said. He said that they would continue to live together for now. His email to 1,420 households was accompanied with a letter of support from the congregation’s president, Arnie Podgorsky, JTA reported. Leader: Steinlauf, pictured right with the Dalai Lama, has been praised with bringing traditional and progressive Jews together. In 2012, he officiated his synagogue's first same-sex marriage . Prominent: He emailed 1,400 households in the Adas Israel Congregation, in Northwest Washington . 'Together with the other officers of Adas Israel, I stand with Rabbi Steinlauf,' it read. 'Our synagogue is strong, large, and inclusive–a big tent with room and respect for all. 'We understand that Rabbi Steinlauf will be undergoing a challenging personal transition in the coming months, and we extend to him patience and a generous spirit.' The letter added that Rabbi Steinlauf had shared his news with the officers of Adas Israel earlier this fall and they decided how he would share it with the congregation. Steinlauf joined Adas six years ago and has since worked to bring more traditional and progressive Jews together. In 2012, he officiated at the first same-sex wedding at Adas Israel.","Gil Steinlauf, 45, sent a letter to his Washington congregation on Monday .

"Google has launched a much anticipated version of its YouTube app aimed at children. The app contains content from DreamWorksTV, Jim Henson TV and National Geographic. The free app is available today on Android devices. Scroll down for video . The home screen comprises eight tiles showing different videos as well as four icons (pictured): a TV set for popular TV shows such as Yo Gabba Gabba, a light bulb for educational programmes, a radio for pop songs and a light bulb for popular videos . Along with favorites from DreamWorksTV, Jim Henson TV, Mother Goose Club, Talking Tom and Friends and more, your kids can watch new series from YouTube channels they already like. National Geographic Kids; Reading Rainbow; and Thomas the Tank Engine leave the world of Sodor for the first time in 70 years to travel the globe. 'Like most parents, I love helping my kids learn more about something they're interested in,' said Shimrit Ben-Yair, mother of two and YouTube Kids Group Product Manager. 'For example, right now, I spend a lot of time on YouTube with my 3-year-old son, who loves watching videos of car washes, Super Simple Songs, and about the universe. 'Today, we’re introducing the YouTube Kids app, the first Google product built from the ground up with little ones in mind. 'The app makes it safer and easier for children to find videos on topics they want to explore, and is available for free on Google Play and the App Store in the U.S.' The app includes a timer to limit kids’ screen time, sound settings to turn off background music and sound effects, and search settings to limit your children to just the pre-selected videos available on the home screen. Ben-Yair, the project's group product manager, told USA Today that the site has seen a 50 per cent increase in viewing time year-on-year, but that the growth has been around 200 per cent for family entertainment channels. ‘Parents were constantly asking us, can you make YouTube a better place for our kids,’ she said. In answer, the company has come up with an app that is simple to use and eliminates features such as viewer comments from the design. The home screencomprises eight tiles showing different videos as well as four icons: a TV set for popular TV shows such as Sesame Street, a light bulb for educational programmes, a radio for pop songs and a light bulb for popular videos. The categories are called: Shows, Music, Learning and Explore. ‘The images are big as are the tap targets for small fingers, and since most younger children can't type they can search with voice,’ Ms Ben-Yair said. MailOnline has learned the app will launch with content from Jim Henson TV, DreamWorks, National Geographic, and a handful of popular YouTubers and new series, such as Thomas the Tank Engine. A stock image of Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street is shown . If children try and search for a raunchy video, for example, the app simply blocks the request and a box that reads ‘Try something else’ pops up. They will be able to search for topics they are curious about though, such as spaceships and find how-to-make a volcano and maths tutorials, for example. Research show that children are just three clicks away from adult content on YouTube . The app will also give parents more power over their children’s viewing habits. It will give them features to control the time children spend on the app so that it shuts down after a number of minutes or hours. It can be re-started again once a password is entered. There will also be an option to mute videos - a feature tested by families and NGOs. MailOnline has learned the app will launch with content from Jim Henson TV, DreamWorks, National Geographic, and a handful of popular YouTubers and new series, such as Thomas the Tank Engine. 'The news that YouTube plans to launch a kid-friendly video app will be welcomed by security savvy parents,' said David Emm, principal security researcher, Kaspersky Lab. 'Our research shows that children can be as little as three click away from inappropriate or adult content on the video platform. 'Examining YouTube’s ""suggested"" videos which sit visibly alongside clips or episodes of popular children’s television programmes such as Peppa Pig, Rastamouse and Dora the Explorer, our researchers have found that, on average, users are just three clicks away from content better suited to a more mature audience.' The child-focused app will in part compete with Netflix’s Kids service and Vine’s child-friendly app showing age-appropriate video clips. The move would appear to be part of Google's strategy to appeal to younger users. YouTube is owned by the search giant. Google recently acquired Launchpad Toys, which is behind the iPad app Toontastic, and has previously announced plans to make child-friendly versions of some of its products such as Chrome and Search, as well as YouTube. Toy manufacturer Mattel has worked with Google to develop a new version of the View-Master, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery. The virtual reality device makes use of Google’s Cardboard to deliver immersive scenes such as Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, called ‘360 degree photospheres’. To release the phone’s virtual reality features, an Android smartphone running Mattel’s app is needed. View-Master gets a make-over! Toy manufacturer Mattel has worked with Google to the new toy, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery. An illustration of the new device is shown . The smartphone needs to be inserted into the device along with a reel,meaning that parents will have to surrender their handsets while children play. The gadget uses augmented reality and animations to make the scenes feel immersive. Mattel says that its View-Master is an affordable platform enabling children to take ‘engaging field trips’ so they can explore famous landmarks, natural scenes and planets, for example, in ‘photospheres’. By pairing an ‘experience reel’ with a smartphone, children ‘will immediately experience an imaginative and interactive learning environment,' the company says. The device itself is set to be released in autumn for $30 (£20), with reels sold in themed packs of four for $15 (£10). Mattel told MailOnline the toy will come to the UK early next year.","App will collate child-friendly videos, songs and educational resources .

"A woman who was mauled by a tiger was in a staff area of the enclosure that animals should not have had access, it has emerged. Sarah McClay, 24, died when she was mauled by a Sumatran tiger at South Lakes Wild Animal Park, in Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria, on Friday afternoon. Detective Chief Inspector Bob Qazi, of Cumbria Police, said: 'It is vitally important that we discover what exactly happened in the big cat enclosure building that led to Sarah coming into contact with the tiger. Police have now ruled out possibility zookeeper Sarah McClay, pictured on a night out, committed suicide . This picture from Disney's Beauty And The Beast was posted on her Facebook days before she died . 'I want to emphasise there is no . suggestion of any foul play or any issue of suicide or self-harm from . the enquiries we have made and evidence we have. 'What has become apparent from our . enquiries is that Sarah was going about her routine duties and was in . the staff section of the enclosure building, which animals are not . allowed access to, when a tiger has entered it from an adjacent pen and . confronted her. 'The tiger has then attacked Sarah, . taking her from the building into the open-air external enclosure area . where Sarah was left and later attended by staff and paramedics. 'We are still trying to establish . exactly how and why the tiger has been able to get from the pen into the . staff area and at the moment believe this to be because of a human or . system error, or mechanical failing, or combination of both.' A spokeswoman from the park confirmed that Sarah was in the staff area of the tiger enclosure. She said: 'We concur with the . recently released Police statement who are acting for the Coroner in . compiling the evidence in accepting that Sarah was in the keeper work area at the time of the incident. 'The door of the tiger den was wide . open and the slides to the outdoor area left open. This allowed the . tiger to enter the housing and sadly attack Sarah as she was right by . the den door. 'It is now clear that Sarah did enter . the tiger den at some point to clean the den by opening the door but . the exact circumstances of how the slides to the outside enclosure were left open is unclear.' Miss McClay was described as a happy, bubbly woman who loved her job at the animal park . Zookeeper Sarah McClay pictured (far right) with her boyfriend David Shaw (far left) at the wedding of her brother Stephen McClay (third left) to Tessa McClay . Zoo owner David Gill said neither the park or the tiger was to blame for the death of keeper Sarah McClay . Miss McClay died after being attacked by a tiger at South Lakes Wild Animal Park. One of the park's tigers is pictured . Sarah was located in the inner corridor of the enclosure, an area that tigers should not have access to as the sliding doors to the inner tiger pens should have been bolted shut. Instead, a tiger was able to drag her from the corridor, through the left pen and out to the outside area were she was killed. She added that the usual procedure . was not followed on the day. She said: 'It is protocol not to open any door of a . den until all slides are confirmed closed and padlocked and all animals . confirmed not in the dens and secured in the outer area. 'For some reason this did not happen resulting in this tragedy. 'At the time of the incident it was . not thought there was any reason that day to enter the tiger facility . hence previous versions of events. 'We are convinced that this was not anything but an accident caused by human error. The park has insisted that the equipment was in full working order at the . time of the incident, but said that Sarah was one of the 'family'. She said: 'The public were never in . danger and the park was given the all clear to re open within hours of . the incident once mechanical and procedural issues were checked for . failure by the local authority and the police investigations team. 'We wish to conclude by stating that . Sarah was one of our family here, she was talented and special. Our . sincere and heartfelt condolences go to her family.' Her brother Stephen, 27, has reacted to the statement, saying that the park director David Gill is blaming Sarah for the incident: . Sarah McClay, 24, was in the staff area of the enclosure when the tiger got in to attack her . He said: 'He's laying the blame squarely at her door before the official police inquiries have begun. It has caused hurt to our family.' Yesterday Stephen said there . was 'no way' his sister would have wanted the animal to be destroyed as . she loved big cats. It comes as police say they do not suspect suicide . or foul play.He . said the family had also been hurt . by suggestions by the park's owner, David Gill, that she had died . because of 'keeper error' and a 'sad error of judgment', the Sun said. 'These are unsubstantiated claims by a man with an obvious axe to grind,' he said. 'My family and I feel his comments are ill-advised, premature and disrespectful. 'He's laying the blame squarely at her door before the official police inquiries have begun. It has caused hurt to our family.' He also told the Daily Record:  'It is not the tiger’s fault. It is just an animal that didn’t know what it was doing. 'I don’t want it to be put down. Sarah wouldn’t ever have wanted that.' In a statement yesterday Ms McClay's . family thanked the efforts of the emergency services and said asked . people to donate to a fund for the conservation of red squirrels in her . memory. Cumbria Police believe an elaborate . enclosure of gates means the animals and its keepers should remain apart . at all times - but this system failed with fatal consequences. The Zoo was closed after Miss McClay was mauled in the enclosure, during one of the tiger's 'starvation' days . Detectives do not suspect foul play . or suicide but say Ms McClay was doing her routine duties in an . enclosure to which animals are not allowed access - when she was then . confronted by the animal which somehow managed to gain access to the . pen. Officers are now trying to establish . whether this was due to a technical fault or human error and have said . there is no suggestion of foul play or issue of suicide or self-harm. Writing on the park's Facebook page, . Mr Gill said: 'We have made a statement that from the investigations . that have taken place it is clear that this tragedy was caused by a sad . error of judgment and breach of protocols, in essence, keeper error. 'This is not blame, it is not anything but defining the facts as they appear. 'This does not mean Sarah killed herself on purpose it means simply she died from her own tragic mistake.' Miss McClay suffered ‘very traumatic’ head and neck injuries in the attack and went into cardiac arrest. Although resuscitated by paramedics, she died in hospital. Keepers are required to enter the . enclosures in the course of their duties. But each one contains a number . of compartments and an elaborate system of gates which should mean the . animals and their keepers remain apart at all times. Park owner David Gill said Miss McClay was a happy, bubbly girl who was good at her job . Police outside the South Lakes Animal Park in Dalton, Cumbria . South Lakes Wild Animal Park in Dalton-in-Furness was closed early after the attack . One of the tigers at the South Lakes Wild Animal Park, which was not involved in the attack . Days before her death, Miss McClay . changed her Facebook picture to a still from the 1991 Disney animation . Beauty and the Beast, which shows a portrait in ribbons after being . slashed by claws. After Miss McClay entered the . enclosure on Friday, staff heard a scream over the radio and ran to the . scene, where they found the two tigers on top of her. Park owner David Gill, 42, said . Padang, the male Sumatran, had instigated the attack. He added that at . the time Padang and Alisha were on what is known as a ‘starve day’, when . they are not fed – to mimic conditions in the wild where tigers may go . for some time without catching any prey. ‘The males are twice the size of the females and Padang had taken control,’ Mr Gill said. He fired two shots with a rifle to . scare away the animals, but Miss McClay, who lived with her boyfriend in . Barrow-in-Furness, had already suffered serious injuries. Detective Chief Inspector Bob Qazi . said: ‘There is no suggestion of any foul play or any issue of suicide . or self-harm from the enquiries we have made and evidence we have. ‘What has become apparent from our . inquiries with witnesses is that Sarah was going about her routine . duties and was in the staff section of the enclosure building, which . animals are not allowed access to, when a tiger has entered it from an . adjacent pen and confronted her.

"University of Minnesota alumnus Adam Martin proved older brother knows best when he brought his sister to a Gophers hockey game last month . Adam and his sister Maria were watching his alma mater play Michigan on Valentine's Day when they were hilariously caught on the kiss cam - a common sports tradition where couples are forced to kiss in front of the entire crowd. A couple of weeks before the game, Adam told Maria that they could be put on kiss cam considering the romantic holiday - but Maria scoffed at the chances they'd end up at the jumbo tron. Scroll down for video . Awkward moment: Adam Martin (left) and sister Maria (right) were caught on kiss cam at a University of Minnesota hockey game on February 14 . Brother's intuition: Martin had an inking he and Maria would be chosen for kiss cam, so he printed out the sign ahead of time just in case . Still, Adam decided to play it safe and printed out the sign at work before heading over to the hockey arena. He printed out the arrow according to which seats they would be in and then showed her the sign before the game. 'She thought I was being a  dumb older brother and there's no way we'd end up on kiss cam,' he told the Gophers. So when the kiss cam started in the third period, Adam whipped out the piece of paper and held it in  his lap while they stared at the first two couples on the big screen. 'And then lo and behold, we were the next . couple on there, and I lifted up the sign and opened it up and somewhat . held a straight face for the first couple seconds and then started . laughing,' he said. No way: Martin printed the sign off at work and showed it to his sister before the game, but she thought he was just being a 'dumb older brother' Getting ready: As kiss cam started, Adam whipped out the piece of paper and held it in his lap as he watched the big screen with his sister . Family fun: The pair start laughing along with the cheering crowd after the man reveals his note . It was a laugh shared not only by those in the crowd but everyone who watched it online as well. Since the video was posted online, it has garned over 13 million views on YouTube. 'I thought it would blow over, and it's gone crazy,' sister Maria told People magazine. If ever caught on the kiss cam with Adam again, Maria said she would hold up a sign that says: 'Older brothers are so embarrassing'. Adam on the other hand, hopes he won't find himself next to his sister again. 'The goal is next year not to bring my sister to the Valentine's Day game. Hopefully I get a date out of this,' he said. 'Kiss cam' became a tradition in the early 1980s as a way to entertain the crowd during pauses in baseball games. It is now a tradition in a majority of major arena sports in the U.S. and Canada, where the camera 'selects' a couple in the audience who are then shown on the giant screen above the pitch - the Jumbotron.","University of Minnesota alumnus Adam Martin brought his sister Maria to a hockey game on February 14 .

"A young woman who was born with a painful club foot made the drastic decision to have her leg amputated - so she could wear high heels for the first time. Born with her left leg painfully twisted Mariah Serrano, 21, was told by doctors that her condition meant she would never wear high heels or be able to pursue her dream job in fashion. Determined, Miss Serrano, from New York, decided to have the lower half of her leg surgically removed and replaced with a prosthetic limb. Now feels glamorous, empowered: Mariah Serrano (pictured center with friends) made the drastic decision to have her lower leg amputated after being born with a club foot so she could wear high heels . Now she can wear all types of footwear including high heels and sandals. She said: ‘It was hard to get used to [high heels], but even girls without foot and leg problems have to learn to wear heels for the first time. I've never felt so glamorous or empowered. ‘When I was told I'd never be able to wear high heels and I should give up my dream career, I was devastated. Since birth: Miss Serrano was born with her left foot painfully twisted and was told by doctors that she would never be able to wear high heels . Before and after: Miss Serrano (left before the amputation) had five operations by the age of 16 to correct her club foot but her condition remained unchanged until now - after surgery (right) she is able to wear high heels for the first time . ‘The specialist said there was another option - to have my leg amputated. Mum was horrified but I couldn't get the idea out of my head. I had to give it some serious thought.’ In most cases, club foot is corrected in childhood by bracing or surgery but by the time Miss Serrano was 16-years-old her condition remained despite enduring five operations. Miss Serrano said: ‘I was sick and . tired of wearing leg braces. Because one foot was much smaller than the . other, shoes were a real issue. ‘I . was forced to wear trainers at my high school prom when I was 17. I . couldn't help but feel jealous of my friends who were wearing heels.’ Follows her dreams: After getting a prosthetic limb (pictured with one of her friends), Miss Serrano has been able to pursue her dream to work in fashion . 'Couldn't get the idea out of my head': Miss Serrano was tired of wearing leg braces and not being able to wear normal shoes because one foot was bigger than the other (left) until a doctor suggested amputation which has enabled her to wear high heels (right). Now she owns 10 pairs . In April 2009 she saw a specialist who talked her through the options for amputation. She said: ‘For the first time I began to think I could actually go through with it, but I was still terrified. ‘It wasn't until I read an article about my favourite designer Alexander McQueen, who'd made a pair of prosthetic legs for the athlete Aimee Mullins that I knew what I had to do. ‘I realised that a beautifully-crafted prosthetic could look good. I made up my mind. At that moment I chose to chop off my leg.’ Wanted heels: Miss Serrano was jealous of her friends who all wore high heels to their school prom while she was forced to wear trainers . The woman underwent the surgery in the summer of 2009 and post-surgery there were some early-stage complications as the wound struggled to heal which led to moments of regret. She said: ‘I wondered what on earth I'd done. I didn't go out and didn't want my friends to come over and see me. It was really hard.' By the winter the wound had improved and she was given her first pair of heels as a gift by her mother Patricia, father Emilio, sisters Isabella and Fiona and brother Mason. She said: ‘They were white basket woven Alice + Olivia platform wedges. As I teetered around the living room wearing them I knew I'd done the right thing. Out and about: Miss Serrano (pictured with friends) said she sometimes feels self-conscious about her prosthetic limb but it has given her the confidence to achieve what she wants from life . Inspired by fashion designer: While considering the amputation, Miss Serrano read about fashion designer Alexander McQueen and the pair of prosthetic legs he made for athlete Aimee Mullins (pictured left modelling the prosthetic limbs and right running with blades) and said she 'knew what I had to do' Shortly after her operation Miss Serrano landed a job at top fashion label Betsey Johnson. She now works as a social media manager in the fashion industry and owns 10 pairs of high-heeled shoes. She said: ‘Choosing to have my leg cut off was the hardest thing I've ever done. I still wake up sometimes and wonder where it is. ‘I've lept out of bed, forgetting that I don't have my leg, and have fallen over. It's still something I'm getting used to. ‘I've learned not to take my prosthetic too seriously. My friends are always joking around with my fake leg. ‘Sometimes I feel self-conscious but my prosthesis has given me so much more confidence and helped me to achieve the life I wanted.’","Mariah Serrano was born with a club foot, her left leg painfully twisted .

"Arrested: John Michael Dodrill was arrested on suspicion of pulling a gun on a seven-year-old girl scout . A girl scout selling cookies was left traumatised after a customer pulled a gun as he opened the door. The seven-year-old and her father were fundraising on Strawberry Tree Lane in Temecula, California, with a tin of baked goods on Sunday morning. But at 11.30am she knocked on a door and was met with a deadly weapon. The pair scarpered, horrified, and called the police. John Michael Dodrill, 59, has been arrested and charged with the offence, and is due to appear in court tomorrow. Online jail records reveal Dodrill had been in custody less than two hours before the girl arrived on his doorstep. Her father, who witnessed the alleged offence, called the police. Two handguns and two rifles have been seized from Dodrill's home, reports claim. The girl is a member of the San Gorgonio Girl Scouts, which will join its sister groups in celebrating National Girl Scout Cookie Day this weekend. The sale of Thin Mints, Samoas, Tagalongs, and other favorites bring in $790 million each year. The trade is also touted as a way to give young girls invaluable life experiences, and to teach them about the values of business ethics and people skills. Girls are encouraged to get out and 'spread the word' to potential customers this Friday and Saturday. Scouts spokesman Jua-Nita Houston said the girl was shaken by the incident but would not be deterred from fundraising. Ms Houston said: 'She set very strong goals for herself, and she’s going to meet those goals.'","7-year-old fundraising around Temecula, California, on Sunday morning .

"A writer and outspoken critic of Islam narrowly escaped being shot dead after he opened his door to a would-be assassin posing as a delivery man at his home in Denmark. The gunman rang the doorbell of 70-year-old Lars Hedegaard's apartment in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen, under the pretext of delivering a parcel, but when the writer opened his front door the hitman pulled out a weapon and fired a shot that just missed Mr Hedegaard's head. According to Mr Hedegaard, who described how the bullet 'flew past' his right ear, said the sniper fled after the writer punched him in the face causing him to drop his gun. Investigation: Danish police outside Mr Hedegaard's apartment in Frederiksberg, where a gunman fired a shot that narrowly missed the writer's head . Assassination attempt: Danish Lars Hedegaard, a writer and outspoken critic of Islam, opened his front door to a gunman posing as a delivery man . Mr Hedegaard, who heads up a group that claims press freedom is under threat from Islam, said the attack had left him shaken but not injured. Police in Copenhagen confirmed they were searching for the suspect, described as a 'foreign' man aged between 20 and 25. Mr Hedegaard said of the shock attack: 'The bullet flew past my right ear, after which I attacked him and punched him in the face, which made him lose the gun.' The gunman then fled the scene, he said. Hedegaard heads the Free Press Society in Denmark and its international offshoot, the International Free Press Society. He is also among the publishers of a weekly anti-Islam newsletter. In April 2012 he was acquitted of hate speech over a series of statements about Muslims. Hunt: Police in Denmark are searching for the suspect, described as a 'foreign' man aged between 20 and 25 . Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt condemned what she called a 'despicable' act. 'It is even worse if the attack is rooted in an attempt to prevent Lars Hedegaard to use his freedom of expression,' she said. Mr Hedegaard has expressed support for a range of outspoken critics of Islam in Europe, including Swedish artist Lars Vilks and Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders. 'Failed attack on my friend and Islam critic Lars Hedegaard in Denmark this morning. My thoughts are with him. Terrible,' Wilders posted on Twitter. The Free Press Society said it was 'shaken and angry', but 'relieved that the perpetrator did not succeed'. Hitman: A police officer gathers evidence outside Mr Hedegaard's home today . Critic: Mr Hedegaard was acquitted of hate speech in 2012 after being accused of making insulting and degrading remarks about Muslims . Several Scandinavian writers, artists and journalists have been exposed to threats and violence from extremists since the 2005 publication of Danish newspaper cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad triggered an uproar in Muslim countries. Many Muslims believe the prophet should not be depicted at all - even in a flattering way - because it might encourage idolatry . In 2010, a Somali man living in Denmark used an axe to break into the home of one of the cartoonists, who escaped unharmed by locking himself into a panic room. Last year, four Swedish residents were convicted of terrorism in Denmark for plotting a shooting spree at the newspaper that first published the Muhammad caricatures. In Sweden, Vilks has lived under police protection after a drawing he made depicting Muhammad as a dog led to death threats from militant Islamists.","Gunman rang doorbell of Lars Hedegaard's apartment in Copenhagen .

"It has been a long standing puzzle to astronomers: why is the Earth's orbit tipped 7 degrees relative to the sun's equator? Now a new theory suggests that violent stage of our solar system's history, an errant young star strayed close and pulled our developing planets out of whack with the sun's equator. Konstantin Batygin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, suggests that our star had a near stellar neighbour at the time Earth formed. Our solar system: All the planets in our system orbit at angles to the sun's equator. A new theory suggests they may have been pulled out of whack by a nearby stellar neighbour that has long ago left the scene . It is the gravitational of this nearby star on our developing system that explains why the planets don't orbit neatly around the sun's equator. Dr Batygin outlines his theory in a letter published in the journal Nature titled A primordial origin for misalignments between stellar spin axes and planetary orbits. The work explains the phenomenon of planets outside the solar system discovered following tilted or even backward orbits. It was thought that such planets were . victims of violent events in which the gravitational force of another . planet kicked them on to their odd paths. A ‘homeless planet’ which floats through space without orbiting a star had been discovered for the first time. Scientists have speculated on the existence of such a planet and have been trawling the night skies for more than a decade, although the hunt was described as looking for a ‘needle in a thousand haystacks’. The isolated planet, shown below in an artist's impression, which astronomers believe may have been flung away during its formation, is not tied by gravity to a star and in 100 light years away. But Dr Konstantin contends that young suns may develop in clusters, with the disks of matter surrounding them and nearly always spreading from the equator being tugged by a neighbouring star. In his letter to Nature, he calculates how a young star's protoplanetary disk can be yanked off its equatorial orbit by a second star. 'I think somewhere in the Milky Way, there's a star that's responsible for tilting us,' he writes, adding that it probably then fled the after the planets formed. Josh Winn, an astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, told ScienceNOW that he thinks Dr Batygin's theory is 'an entirely plausible idea'. 'The best thing about it is we can test it,' he added, telling the online magazine that he hopes to use instruments to observe multiplanet systems and to evaluate the theory. Nasa's Kepler spacecraft has so far measured the tilt of just one multiplanet system, Kepler 30, whose three planets all line up with their sun's equator. Of course, there are many solar systems that still have more than one star, for example our nearest neighbour Alpha Centauri, which has three stars - one of which has a planet similar in size to our own. 'There's a good chance that astronomers will find misalignment in the Alpha Centauri system,' Dr Batygin says.","The Earth circles around the solar system at an angle 7 degrees off the solar equator .

"The nurse found dead after a hoax call to the hospital treating the Duchess of Cambridge left three notes, a court heard yesterday.

The mother of two had also sent a number of emails and made telephone calls that police believe might help explain what happened. During a five-minute hearing at Westminster Coroner’s Court yesterday it was revealed that attempts were made to revive the nurse but they were ‘to no avail’. Detective Chief Inspector James Harman said: ‘Jacintha Saldanha was found by a colleague and a member of security staff. Sadly she was found hanging. There were also injuries to her wrist. The London Ambulance Service was called to the scene. At this time there are no suspicious circumstances.’ Scotland Yard detectives are examining the notes, as well as interviewing Mrs Saldanha’s friends, family and colleagues at London’s King Edward VII hospital. Mrs Saldanha, a night sister, was the senior nurse on duty when she took a call at 5.30am on Tuesday from Australian DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian, who were pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles. She unwittingly transferred the call to a colleague, who described in detail the condition of Kate, who was being treated for severe morning sickness.

The . mass will be offered 'for the repose of the soul of Jacintha and her . grieving family', a spokesman for Westminster Cathedral said. 'We would hope to hold a more formal memorial after the inquest has concluded.' Mrs Saldanha’s accountant husband Ben . Barboza, 49, identified her body. Coroner Fiona Wilcox opened and . adjourned the inquest until March 26. Mrs Saldanha, who was born in India, . lived in London during the week and returned home to Bristol to be with . her family at weekends. Mr Barboza and children Junal, 17, and Lisha, . 14, had been expecting her home for the weekend and were apparently . unaware of her role in the hoax call. Labour MP Keith Vaz, who has been . representing the family, said they could expect the results of a . post-mortem examination within four days. Hearing: Members of the media gather outside Westminster Coroner's Court in central London where the inquest into the death of Jacintha Saldana is being held . Together: Ms Jacintha's husband Barboza (centre) and her children Lisha and Junal (pictured here with Labour MP Keith Vaz (right), had no idea the nurse had received the hoax phone call . He added: ‘The family is very grateful . to the coroner’s court for the way they have dealt with the matter and . they are extremely grateful to the Metropolitan Police. ‘As you know they are very upset and they are grieving and they are comforting each other.’ A memorial service is due to take . place in Bristol tonight and a mass is to be held for Mrs Saldanha at . London’s Westminster Cathedral tomorrow morning. Saddened: Sydney-based 2DayFM radio presenters Michael Christian (left) and Mel Greig (right in left, and right) made a grovelling apology in two interviews aired on Australian TV yesterday (one seen right) The mass will be offered ‘for the . repose of the soul of Jacintha and her grieving family’, a spokesman for . Westminster Cathedral said. He added: ‘We would hope to hold a more . formal memorial after the inquest has concluded.’ Southern Cross Austereo, the parent . company of Sydney-based 2Day FM which broadcast the hoax call, has ended . Greig and Christian’s Hot 30 show and suspended prank calls across the . company. Last night it was revealed Mrs . Saldanha’s family have been offered bereavement counselling in their . home city of Bristol by the King Edward VII hospital. In a letter to John Lofthouse, the chief executive of the private hospital, Mr Vaz says the family will take up this offer.

A . full and searching inquiry was launched by Australia’s media watchdog . today into the royal radio prank, following which nurse Jacintha . Saldanha committed suicide. The . Australian Communications and Media Authority has powers to compel 2Day . FM’s parent company, Southern Cross Austereo, to name those who . approved the infamous hoax going to air. The . authority will look into whether the radio station complied with their . broadcasting licence conditions – and insiders said today that if the . findings were against the station it could lose its licence. Presenter: 2Day FM DJ Mel Greig is pictured (right in left photo) with her sister Alana Munday (left in left) in Adelaide in April 2011 - and (right) at Oakbank Racecourse in South Australia in the same month . The . authority’s chairman, Mr Chris Chapman, said it would be examining . ‘whether the licensee has complied with its broadcasting obligations.’ Miss . Saldanha took her life just days after receiving a hoax phone call at . London’s King Edward VII hospital from Sydney DJs Mel Greig and Michael . Christian. She and . another nurse in the ward where Kate Middleton was being treated for . morning sickness believed they were talking to the Queen and Prince . Charles, despite the unimpressive attempts by the DJs to imitate the . royals. Although . Austero has repeatedly apologised for the ‘tragic, regrettable death’ of . the nurse and has committed at least $500,000 (£326,000) to a memorial . fund for her family, the media watchdog has shown its determination to . dig deeper into the scandal. It is expected to demand who was working at the time the hoax was perpetrated and who approved it. Those who will be questioned, it is understood, will be producers and lawyers who were on duty, or on call, at the time. Austereo . has been in damage control ever since the death of nurse Saldanha, . including permitting the two DJs to appear on Australian tv and, amid . their tears, express their sorrow for the tragic consequences of their . hoax call. The watchdog . will be referring heavily to the radio broadcasting code, particular a . part which states that it is a breach to record a person in . conversation, and also air it, without their knowledge. Section 6.1 of the code states that ‘a licensee must not broadcast the . words of an identifiable person unless that person has been informed in . advance or a reasonable person would be aware that the words may be . broadcast.’ The section . adds that there must not be a broadcast unless, ‘in the case of words . which have been recorded without the knowledge of the person, that . person has subsequently, but prior to the broadcast, expressed consent . to the broadcast of the word.’ The . station’s parent company has said it attempted to contact the hospital . five times following the hoax call to discuss it, but had not been able . to speak to anyone. The . company has not explained why it still went to air with the recording . even though it had not been able to reach anyone at the hospital . following the prank. It . is understood the hospital has written to Austereo demanding to know . how it has arrived at a figure of $500,000 to be given to the nurse’s . family – and has given it until tomorrow to reply.

"The crocodile's fearsome death roll is a hunting technique the reptiles have been using since the age of the dinosaurs. New findings show that ancient ancestors of the saltwater crocodile were capable of using the rolling tactic to rip flesh from dinosaurs, including those similar to the T-Rex. Bite marks found on fossils suggest that species such as the deinosuchus - known as North America's terrible crocodile - were able to lock on to large dinosaurs before killing them. Ferocious: The deinosuchus, which roamed Earth 80 million years ago, was capable of putting dinosaurs such as the albertosaurus in a death roll . In a hunting style replicated today, the reptiles would clamp their powerful jaws around their prey, before tearing off flesh by using the weight of their spinning body. The hunting technique puts a lot of pressure on the predator's skull, but a study to compare the skulls of 16 living species and three extinct ones found that it was possible in the ancient and huge crocodiles. Two of the ancient species - the deinosuchus which roamed North America 80 million years ago, and the purussauraus, which lurked in the swaps of South America - were able to use the death roll, researchers said. The deinosuchus, which grew to nearly 40ft and weighed up to 18,700lb, was able to even bring down medium-sized . dinosaurs such as theropods, which is the same group the T-Rex belonged . to, according to Live Science. The purussaurus, which was 42ft long and weighed 22,000lb, would have used the death roll as it hunted giant rodents and turtles more than 8 million years ago. Killer move: Scientists examined the skull of a deinosuchus to prove it was possible for the 'terrible crocodile' to carry out a death roll . Fearsome: The deinosuchus and purussaurus, shown second and third from top, used the same hunting tactics as the modern saltwater crocodile, pictured at the bottom of this size chart . However, the oldest species included in the study, which roamed Africa and South America about 110 million years ago, was not able to use a death roll. Scientists found that the bone structure of the sarcosuchus, which was 37ft long and weighed 17,600lb, could not withstand the pressure the hunting style put on the skull. Although it was capable of bringing down large prey, the ancient reptile's narrow snout restricted its abilities. To give an idea of how the ancient reptiles measured up to their modern cousin, the saltwater crocodile . grows to about 23ft and weighs more than 2,200lb. Known as the world's . largest and most aggressive reptile, the Australian species eats cattle, attacks sharks, . and has even killed people . Ancient skills: The saltwater crocodile uses the same hunting style as its ancestors did in the age of dinosaurs . While the ancient crocodiles grew to a fearsome size, researchers believe the death roll move was easier for a youngster to carry out. 'It is possible that very large . specimens use other approaches for taking chunks of meat from large . vertebrates,' Ernesto Blanco, lead author of the study that was published in Historical Biology, said. The researcher from Uruguay added that it is possible the ancient crocodiles just swallowed their prey whole.","Study proves ancient species' skulls could withstand pressure needed to carry out the deadly move .

The photo also generated comments of support such as: 'What a beautiful photo such admiration for the mums who tackled parenthood and their degree.' One mother wrote: 'That's awesome, I have 4 children I had last one whilst studying at USC and was supported and able to continue studying whilst breastfeeding and bringing my son to some classes.

Jacci Sharkey says 'it was a a nice moment' when she breastfed her child just before heading into the graduation ceremony on October 2 . However the photo was also met with backlash, some saying that breastfeeding is 'a beautiful private thing that does not need to be shared with the public'. The criticism continued: 'This is deep connection that you can still have if you cover yourself, what is the big deal putting a blanket so you keep the moment to yourself.' Another wrote: 'Urinating is natural, should we start doing it in public? Or defecating? Literally everyone does these things. If we put toilets in the street with no walls will people accept it as ""beautiful"" and ""natural""? A breast out in public is still a breast out in public whether it's sexualized or for feeding a child. Just think about it.' The photo also caused outrage for one particular mother who wrote: 'Have some respect for not only yourself but your child. I raised 5 and NEVER put my boob out there!! Why? I value my self respect.' This comes after a British mother's photo, which captured the first moment she breastfed her premature baby daughter, was removed from Facebook as it 'breached nudity rules'. The Daily Mail told how Emma Bond posted the picture of herself with Carene, who was born 12 weeks early, nearly two week ago. The image was only viewable to those she had approved as online friends. The 24-year-old was shocked when the site deleted it the same day after an unidentified person - believed to be one of her friends - reported it as offensive.

"A Virginia mother was outraged after a picture she posted on Instagram of her children became a focus for cruel and insulting comments. For Father's Day, Ciara Logan had put a picture online of her eight-year-old son and twin daughters aged 2. But what should have been a happy family photo quickly became a magnet for inappropriate comments after a stranger turned the photo into a meme. Ridiculed: An Instagram user turned what should have been a cute family picture into a cruel internet meme . Ms Logan only realized what had happened after noticing she had a new follower on Instagram. When she scrolled through that person's images, she saw her children's picture. The photo showed her children smartly dressed, with her son in a white suit and blue shirt, and the twins wearing cute summer dresses. But an unknown Instagram user had added a quote from The Color Purple under the image, saying: 'Harpo just won't let them girls be'. Underneath the meme, others had joined in the cruel joke, adding a series of insulting hashtags that suggested Ms Logan's son was a pimp, or that made light of the missing schoolgirls in Nigeria. Ms Logan told CBS 6 she was upset by the mocking comments which 'insinuate my son is a pimp, or is . selling cars, because he has on a suit and has two little girls with him . - or to hashtag, ""keep him away from those girls"", as if to say he's a . predator'. 'He's an 8-year-old boy who is very caring, very loving, very nourishing, very protective of his sisters.' she added. Shocked: Ciara Logan was upset to discover a picture of her children had been turned into a internet joke . The mother-of-three tried to contact the Instagram user who had altered her family photo, but he blocked her, changed his name and moved his account settings to private. Instagram was also unable to help, advising the mother to simply remove all pictures of her children as a precaution, and to make her account private. Ms Logan said the incident had opened her eyes to the problems of the internet, and warned other parents to be more cautious. ''Get a page that is for family only and . private your page,' she said. The children's grandmother, Louse Logan, was also upset by the image, telling CBS: 'To have someone display my grandchildren, with so much negative connotations and distastefulness ... I was just in awe, and it needs to stop.'","Ciara Logan was shocked at mocking comments aimed at her son .

"Damning: The CQC said patients are being given the wrong drugs and picking up serious infections . Four in ten hospitals are unsafe, a damning report reveals today. Patients are being given the wrong drugs and picking up serious infections while shortages of staff mean the elderly are neglected and suffering falls, says the care watchdog. A&E units and maternity wards are particular causes of concern, according to the Care Quality Commission. In one shocking case, casualty patients were left for hours on trolleys in a temporary building to await treatment. ‘Far too many hospitals were inadequate on safety,’ declared CQC chief David Behan. The findings are contained in an annual report into NHS standards which also covers care homes and GP surgeries. ‘The public is being failed by the numerous hospitals, care homes and GP practices that are unable to meet the standards that their peers achieve and exceed,’ warns the report. The CQC has inspected 82 out of all 162 NHS hospital trusts. It found 65 were either ‘inadequate’ or ‘requires improvement’ in terms of safety. This means four in five of those inspected were unsafe. The watchdog says this isn’t representative of all hospitals because it inspected those expected to be failing first. However, it still means 41 per cent of all trusts – four in ten – have already been found inadequate in terms of safety – and the watchdog is only halfway through its inspections. The findings come less than two years after a major overhaul of hospital standards that followed the Mid Staffordshire scandal, in which hundreds died due to neglect. Trusts were urged to hire extra staff, carry out hourly checks of patients and take extra measures to prevent mistakes with drugs and in surgery. But the CQC found that many hospitals were severely short of nurses at night, meaning frail patients are more likely to fall when they try to go to the toilet. Inspectors also found cases of staff forgetting to give medication or giving it to the wrong patient after notes became mixed up. Concern: Inspectors found cases of staff  giving medication to the wrong patient or not at all (posed by model) A&E units caused particular concern and at the Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham, Kent, patients were being left for hours in a temporary building due to a lack of space. The watchdog is also worried that at many maternity units there are too few doctors and midwives on duty. Mr Behan, CQC chief executive, said: ‘The majority [of hospitals] required improvement on safety. ‘There is too much variation in quality and safety between services and within service. People need to have confidence that they will get good care.’ The watchdog also inspected 1,725 surgeries and found that one in five were not meeting required standards of safety. Again, it said this was not representative of all 8,000 practices in England because it started off by checking up on the worst. Only yesterday Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that basic errors across the NHS were costing up to £2.5billion a year in extra treatment and legal fees. Exposure: Jeremy Hunt (left) said the report by the CQC's David Behan (right) 'highlights examples of excellent care but it also exposes unacceptable levels of variation – exactly why…we’re confronting underperformance' Referring to the CQC report, he said it ‘highlights examples of excellent care but it also exposes unacceptable levels of variation – exactly why…we’re confronting underperformance in the NHS as never before.’ On one ward at an unnamed hospital an elderly woman with dementia developed two urinary infections because there were no nurses to help her to the toilet and she had to wet the bed. This caused her to become extremely confused which staff just dismissed as another symptom of dementia. Dr Katherine Rake of Healthwatch England, which champions patients’ rights, said: ‘The variability in care is simply unacceptable. We wholeheartedly support the CQC’s challenge to sub-standard parts of the system to improve and ensure everyone has access to high quality, safe and dignified support.’ Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘This report explains why people have reached the conclusion the NHS is simply not safe in David Cameron’s hands.’","A&E and maternity of special concern, said the Care Quality Commission .

"Georgia is a 16-year-old with a lousy attitude; she swears at the teachers, won’t wear her school uniform and storms out of class when she’s told off. But the platinum blonde is also the first of her family to almost reach the end of her school life without being expelled, and her teachers at the Thornhill Community Academy are proud that she’ll end up sitting her GCSEs. Georgia is one of the 'stars' of Educating Yorkshire. By turns horrifying and heartwarming, this reality TV show makes fascinating viewing even if it is, at times, a little uncomfortable. Tough job: Headteacher Johnny Mitchell stars in Educating Yorkshire along with some of his charges . Filmed over eight weeks, it shows the inner workings of the comprehensive in Dewsbury, Yorkshire, from teachers’ meetings to the school prom. Each story is compelling, from the young Asian girl cramming for her GCSEs, to the bullied boy who can’t stop lashing out with his fists. At the heart of it all is no-nonsense head teacher Jonny Mitchell, who has a penchant for singing to himself. He’s been at Thornhill for just under two years and he’s determined to give his pupils a decent education and teach them how to be model citizens; even if it’s the last thing they want. The show is made by the same people who made 2011’s hit show Educating Essex. 'There are universal themes in both shows, but I think you get a real flavour of Yorkshire in our show,' says Jonny. 'Dewsbury, to most people, has negative connotations but we wanted to do something to make our young children proud. We’re trying very hard to make their lives better under difficult circumstances.' Dewsbury has a 20 per cent unemployment rate and Jonny estimates that  10 per cent of his pupils’ parents are white collar workers; the rest are blue collar and unemployed. Half his students are of Asian, mainly Pakistani, origin while the rest are white British. TV star: But Mr Mitchell said they quickly forgot about the cameras . A former failing school which is now rated ‘good’ by Ofsted, Thornhill was forecast to get 45 per cent A-C grades at GCSE last year; it actually managed 63 per cent. 'I think we’re doing a fantastic job and I wanted to put that across,' says Jonny of his reasons for agreeing to 65 cameras being placed in almost every corner of his school. 'I think our kids are brilliant and they deserve to experience something a little bit different.' Jonny says staff and pupils were only really aware of the cameras for the first few days. 'In the first 20 minutes the kids were acting up but we told them you won’t be a TV star if you make all these obscene gestures and they stopped. 'The prom thing is ridiculous, it's . quite obscene. A lot of our families are financially . deprived but they all want to keep up with each other' 'For the first two days it felt weird, but quite exciting. Everyone was coming in with new hairdos. But then it was business as usual although, generally, behaviour improved a bit. It’s still better than it was; I think that’s because they know the show’s coming out and they don’t want to let the side down.' The programme certainly shows the ups and downs of teaching. There are huge challenges, from the children whose behaviour constantly disrupts classes to the boy with a stutter who’s terrified about how he’ll cope with his oral examinations. There are also moments of farce and pathos, such as when Jonny has to tell a boy’s shocked mother that he hasn’t behaved well enough to go to the school prom. She’d already taken out a loan and shelled out £1,500 to hire a sports car and £2,000 on a suit for her son. 'The prom thing is ridiculous, it’s quite obscene,' says Jonny. 'A lot of our families are financially deprived but they all want to keep up with each other. They spend shedloads on a dress their daughters will never wear again. It’s bonkers.' In this media savvy world, the children and staff are going to become ‘stars’ in their own right – with all the potential online bullying that comes with it. Jonny says the children have been well prepared. 'We’ll have a lot of support from the production company and Channel 4, who have given us a list of people the children can talk to individually. Lots of the kids have been briefed beforehand and told what the impact might be. There’s a huge support network.' Reality bites: The show reveals the inner workings of a comprehensive in Dewsbury . Over 100 schools volunteered to be featured, and it took ten months for Thornhill to be chosen and for its staff, pupils and parents to get to know the producers and be fully on board. 'I know some people would call it a leap of faith, but I got to know the producers pretty well during that time. I think it speaks volumes about their professionalism that I was willing to stake my reputation and that of my colleagues on two people I’ve only known for a few months.' Although consent forms had to be signed at every stage of the process, the school had no editorial control and sometimes the teachers as well as the pupils are seen making mistakes. 'It shows humanity,' says Jonny. 'Yes it shows error, but it also shows people working hard. I don’t think any of us come out of it at all badly.' Jonny, who looks like a nightclub bouncer but actually began his working life as an accountant, is hoping the show will attract more pupils as the school’s not quite fully subscribed. 'I want to pull in nearby kids, and we can only do that by improving and being successful. This show will add kudos for us. I hope it works.'

"Seven planets in the Milky Way outside our solar system could potentially harbour life, researchers from an ambitious project to catalogue all habitable worlds have announced. The Habitable Exoplanets Catalog (HEC) celebrated its first anniversary with the announcement that it had exceeded expectations in its search for possible new Earths. Lead researcher Abel Mendez, director of the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo's Planetary Habitability Laboratory, said the team had hoped to add perhaps one or two planets in the project's first year. 'Xmas Planets': A collage of computer generated . images of possibly habitable worlds made to celebrate the first year of . the Planetary Habitability Laboratory's Habitable Exoplanets Catalog. Earth is at the top right . The addition of five possibly habitable planets over the two already known totally exceeded anyone's expectations, he said. 'There are many press releases announcing discoveries of habitable planets ... and that is confusing,' Professor Mendez told SPACE.com. 'So having a catalog that everyone can check what is available right now is useful.' With scientists improving their techniques for finding planets outside the solar system, the pace of discovery is increasing, he added. The High Accuracy Radial Velocity . Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument in Chile and the orbiting Kepler . Space Telescope are just two of the tools helping researchers find new . exoplanets every month. In order of discovery: . Professor Mendez's team at the . Planetary Habitability Laboratory launched the HEC in December last . year.  It was conceived out of the need to . measure the suitability for life of these emerging worlds and as a way . to organise them for the general public. There are nearly 80 confirmed exoplanets with a similar size to Earth but only a few of those have the right distance from their star to support liquid water on the surface, the researchers say. The catalogue uses habitability assessments like the Earth Similarity Index (ESI), the Habitable Zones Distance (HZD), the Global Primary Habitability (GPH), classification systems, and comparisons with Earth past and present. However the exoplanet classifications use the word terran instead of ‘Earth-size’ to avoid a strict comparison with Earth since many of these worlds might have some physical similarities with Earth but might not necessary be Earth-like. Dusk on an alien world: How sunsets might look . on four of the new worlds discovered, compared with Earth on the far . left, according to data collected by the HEC project. The image corrects for the size, colours, and brightness of the star and sky as seen from an Earth-like world. The size of and colours of the star of Kepler-22b look similar to Earth because it orbits a Sun-like star. The sunsets of Gliese 667Cc and 581d look much redder because they orbit a red dwarf star, with the sky of Gliese 581d much darker due to its greater distance. The star of HD 85512b is the brightest of all cases although the star of Gliese 667Cc is the biggest . Seven potentially habitable exoplanets are now listed by HEC, including the disputed Gliese 581g, plus some 27 more from NASA Kepler candidates waiting for confirmation. But the organisation cautions that while these are objects of interest for further astronomical observations, there is no guarantee on the habitability or even the existence of many of these planets. It will take many new observations, and more ground and space observatories to verify and characterize these objects, the HEC team says. The HEC was launched, December 5th, 2011, the same day that the NASA Kepler team announced the discovery of Kepler 22b during the First Kepler Science Conference in NASA Ames, California. The first confirmed extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, were discovered from the Arecibo Observatory 20  years ago, in 1992. These were extreme planets around the pulsar PSR-B1257+12. In 1995 the planet 51 Pegasi b was discovered around a more typical Sun-like star. Today scientists know of nearly 900 confirmed exoplanets with over 2,500 still awaiting confirmation. However only a few of those might be candidates for life as we know it. It started with just two planets, Gliese 581d and HD 85512b. Later, Kepler 22b, Gliese 667Cc, Gliese 581g, Gliese 163c, and HD 40307g were added, in chronological order. All these exoplanets are superterrans, aka Super-Earths, and quite larger than Earth but still considered potentially habitable. Scientists have not yet found a true Earth analogue. The HEC is now a very complex computer program that incorporates data from many exoplanet databases, such as the Extrasolar Planet Encyclopedia and NASA Exoplanet Archive, plus many updates from other research groups. It receives most of the data of new relevant discoveries directly from the research teams, which is then analysed and added to the catalog at the moment of their public announcement. In the coming year, the HEC will be expanded with new models and analysis, which is expected to affect many of the objects listed and offer new visualisations and habitability assessments. However, the biggest impact will come not from changes in the HEC's maths, but from new discoveries, the team says. 'A true Earth analogue or a potentially habitable exomoon would be big discoveries,' they said. 'Certainly, this was the right time to start mapping the habitable universe around us.'","Habitable Exoplanets Catalog says first year has exceeded expectations .

"First lady Michelle Obama will not take questions from reporters or give interviews during her tour of China that begins today, and members of the press corps who usually follows the first family everywhere can't travel with her entourage. And although she will make a few speeches with reporters in the room, the picture is largely one of an expensive, taxpayer-funded tourism exercise for Mrs. Obama, her two daughters, and her mother – not the official trip the White House has projected. White House press officials haven't comment on the record about whether a reported ban on question-and-answer interviews applies equally to American journalists and international reporters. And limited information made available to MailOnline suggests that only two out of 22 scheduled events on the trip will afford journalists a chance to do any significant reporting – including a solitary speech – but still without interviewing Mrs. Obama. Both of those events, the White House says, will afford 'limited' space for the press. First lady Michelle Obama jets off to China today with her daughters and her mother, on a trip that will likely cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in Secret Service protection . Mrs. Obama is used to having reporters around on Air Force One, but her staff have shut journalist out of her China junket . 'How does this comport with the standards of an ""official"" trip that uses government resources?' MailOnline asked. 'Doesn't this look more like a vacation at taxpayer expense if she's not going to interface with the media?' White House travel can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars since members of the president's family must take a phalanx of Secret Service agents with them wherever they go. Those agents and their staffers need hotel rooms, rental vehicles and per diem meal expenses. The cost of operating a government aircraft large enough for that entourage is also significant. But the White House has met most questions about the trip with silence, leaving a Monday conference call with reporters, one full of official political overtones, as the only official comment that reporters can write about. An email to journalists with a preview of events in China carries the ominous warning 'FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY / NOT FOR REPORTING' and describes the limited media access for each of her appearances. As a result, MailOnline can't report on its contents, other than to summarize the number of press opportunities available. Even that required special permission from a White House official. Nine of them are photo-opportunities, including six where only a single 'pool' photographer will have any access. Mrs. Obama's arrival and departure from three Chinese cities will be 'open press,' but are likely to consist of a wave from an airport tarmac. Michelle Obama has taken questionable trips at huge taxpayer expense before, including her annual jaunt -- with her children but without the president -- to Aspen for President's Day weekend skiing . Two events are closed to the press entirely; two will only permit a single 'pool' reporter to attend and watch; press access for one is still to be decided. There are only two events during the trip that are completely open to journalists, but the White House has indicated that the first lady won't be interviewed or take questions during those appearances, and they are marked 'space limited' on her itinerary. 'Throughout the week she will participate in open press and pooled events including speeches at two schools, questions from students online and forums including a CNN iReport,' a White House official told MailOnline. But the Obama administration has left journalists with the impression that while she will face very limited press scrutiny, Mrs. Obama is attempting to affect bilateral relations with China. No reporters are traveling on the government aircraft that whisks her and her family members to the Far East today. 'The most powerful message we can deliver [to the Chinese people] is one of the examples of not just the first lady’s life story but of America and our values,' Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters during the Monday call. 'That alone I think speaks to things like respect for human rights that are interwoven into the DNA of the United States of America.' Good will ambassador? When Michelle Obama speaks in public, even to a Muppet, she often carries the official trappings of the White House with her -- leading many to look for political ties to her China trip . Mrs. Obama played a White-House-official role on Friday when Vice President Joe Biden (C) greeted Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny (L) Melanne Verveer, chief of staff to Hillary Clinton when she was the first lady, told The New York Times that 'politics can be imposed' on trips like Mrs. Obama's, and that 'people will want to put a political spin' on it. The China trip isn't the first junket for the first lady and her daughters: THey traditionally take a President's Day ski trip every year while President Obama golfs in Florida . And Anita McBride, chief of staff to Laura Bush during her time in the White House, said that since the trip will have 'a very tightly controlled schedule, and there is no media and no interviews,' Mrs. Obama might be able to avoid getting political. Rhodes began Monday's telephone briefing with a statement that sounded more like politics than vacation planning. He later insisted that the White House wouldn't comment on the quasi-official trip's cost to taxpayers. 'First of all, as you all know, the bilateral relationship between the United States and China is really as important as any relationship in the world,' he said. 'China of course now is the second-largest economy in the world. It's our fastest-growing trading partner, and it’s also a country we cooperate with on a whole host of international issues. ... We're very clear when we have differences with China on a host of issues, so it's a relationship that allows for both a constructive cooperation, and candor when we disagree.' He also told reporters on the call that Mrs. Obama will 'be staffed from our office, and as with our other trips, with staff and who know the area that we’re going to.' Tina Tchen, Mrs. Obama's chief of staff, added that the first lady's planned 'people-to-people' exchanges in China are 'not only good for those individuals,' but 'it is really vital for the competitiveness of our U.S. global economy.'","The first lady is taking her mother and daughters to three Chinese cities on a 'people-to-people exchange' trip at taxpayer expense .
Only 2 out of 22 events on her calendar will give reporters the chance to hear her speak and do any real reporting – but without interviewing her .

"'Reclusive': A court heard that Ryan Cleary was 'great power on the internet' A teenager accused of attacking the websites of the CIA and the Pentagon was described in court yesterday as a ‘great power on the internet’ who can attack anyone he does not like in cyberspace. ‘Reclusive’ Ryan Cleary, 19, was accused of ‘infecting’ more than 100,000 computers around the world and of being a key member of a hacking group called Lulzsec. He was held at his home in Essex on Monday in a joint operation between the FBI and Scotland Yard. He was granted bail at Westminster Magistrates Court in London, but prosecutors appealed against the decision, which means Cleary must remain in custody until tomorrow when the case will be reconsidered. The court heard that Cleary had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism, since his arrest last week, . He was granted bail today but prosecutors immediately objected, meaning that he will remain in custody until Monday when an appeal will be heard. The case draws parallels with that of Gary McKinnon, who also has Asperger's, and is fighting extradition to America over allegations of hacking into US military computers. He admits breaking into systems including those of Nasa and the Pentagon but says he was seeking UFO evidence. Custody: Cleary sits in the dock at Westminster Magistrates Court accused of carrying out hacking attacks . Today, district judge Nicholas Evans, sitting at City of Westminster Magistrates' Court, heard that Cleary's condition was diagnosed by a psychologist. Cleary did not enter any plea to the five offences under the Criminal Law and Computer Misuse Act with which he is charged. His bail appeal will be heard at Southwark Crown Court, where the case is also due for a plea and case management hearing on August 30. Cleary was arrested at his family home . on Monday as part of a Scotland Yard and FBI probe into LulzSec, a group . which claims responsibility for hacking attempts on Soca, the US Senate . and the CIA. Concern: The suspected hacker's mother Rita Cleary leaves City of Westminster Magistrates after her son was denied bail after prosecutors complained . He is charged with conspiring with other people on or before June 20 to create a remotely controlled network of zombie computers, known as a 'botnet', to carry out distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, where websites are flooded with traffic to make them crash. He is also alleged to have carried out similar attacks against the British Phonographic Industry's website and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's website on or before June 20. If he wins his bail appeal on Monday, he will be subject to the conditions that he will not have access to the internet and will not have in his possession any device which could access the internet. The conditions also state that no device capable of accessing the internet can be within his home address, that he must live and sleep at that address, and that he must not leave his address other than in the company of his mother, Rita Cleary.

'I found that the more I forced myself to take images, the more I saw. On days where inspiration didn't come verily easily, I would set things up and as I love music I decided to get my kids involved, dressing them up as rock stars. 'I would stick the tunes on, show the children a picture of the rock star and we would make some photographs. 'It's just great to spend time being creative with the girls and introducing them to the music that I love - they are huge fans of the Happy Mondays now.'

"Google's controversial Glass wearable computer can be used to steal people's PIN codes from ten feet away simply by looking at them, it has been claimed. Researchers developed special software to analyse the shadows and movements of peoples’ fingers in order to decipher PIN codes entered into tablets and smartphones. The team also showed the same technique would work using an iPhone 5, Samsung Smartwatch and webcam. Scroll down for video . Look out! Researchers say Glass can capture a PIN number  using a new analysis app that looks at how a person moves their arms . A range of gadgets was tested including Google Glass, an iPhone 5, a Samsung smartwatch and a Logitech webcam. Video captured by Glass produced a correct four digit PIN from three metres away with 83 per cent accuracy (this was improved to more than 90 per cent with manual corrections) while the webcam was accurate 92 per cent of the time. The research team led by Professor Xinwen Fu of the University of Massachusetts Lowell are set to show off their software at the Blackhat hackers conference. 'Our spying camera, including Google Glass, can take a video of the victim tapping on the touch screen and automatically recognize more than 90% of the tapped passcodes from three meters away, even if our naked eyes cannot see those passcodes or anything on the touch screen,' they wrote. The basic idea, the team said, is to track the movement of the fingertip and use the fingertip's relative position on the touch screen to recognize the touch input. 'We carefully analyze the shadow formation around the fingertip, apply other computer vision techniques to automatically track the touching fingertip and locate the touched points.' The team can then estimate exactly where on the screen the finger is touching. They say their hack could easily be used in conferencesor even in bars where there are people entering PIN numbers. The researcher's diagram showing how they were able to reliably capture PINs with a camcorder from 44 meters away - from a third floor window . 'We are interested in scenarios such as conferences and similar gathering places where a Google Glass, webcam, or smartphone can be used for a stealthy attack.' The team is also working on a solution -  a secure keyboard which appears in a different part of the screen each time iit is used. 'Any camera works, but you can’t hold your iPhone over someone to do this,' Fu told Wired magazine. 'Because Glass is on your head, it’s perfect for this kind of sneaky attack.' In response to the research Google issued a statement saying: 'Unfortunately, stealing passwords by watching people as they type them is nothing new. We designed Glass with privacy in mind. The UMass researchers testing PIN-spying with Google Glass: they found that codes could easily be captured from ten feet away using Glass . 'The fact that Glass is worn above the eyes and the screen lights up whenever it’s activated clearly signals it’s in use and makes it a fairly lousy surveillance device.' The research team were also able to record PIN codes using the same software from a distance of nearly 150 feet by using a more expensive camcorder with an optical zoom, and were able to capture a target’s PIN from a fourth story window on the other side of the road.","Software can analyse video taken ten feet away and reveal PIN number .

"EMP attack could instantly cripple defence and infrastructure systems . North Korea has the capability to deliver on its threats to carry out a nuclear electromagnetic pulse attack on the United States, it has been claimed. Dr Peter Vincent Pry, executive director of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security, has reportedly seen a long-suppressed government report that concludes North Korea is capable of using an Unha-3 rocket to carry out an attack on the U.S.. He says the U.S. would be particularly vulnerable to such an attack, as any rocket from North Korea is likely to travel over the South Pole and approach from the south - something American missile defences would apparently be powerless to stop. Fears: The leaked Department of Homeland Security report allegedly claims that North Korea's communist leader Kim Jong-un (pictured) has already successfully practiced an electromagnetic pulse attack on the U.S. Launch: Dr Peter Vincent Pry claims to have seen a long-suppressed government report that concludes North Korea is capable of using an Unha-3 rocket (pictured) to carry out an electromagnetic pulse attack on the U.S. Dr Pry made the claims in an interview with the World News Daily website, in which he was quoted as saying: 'The North Koreans are seeing what they can get away with... It shows that Pyongyang is planning something big against the U.S.' Dr Pry's Task Force on National and Homeland Security advises U.S. Congress on matters of defence, and he was also formerly the head of the Congressionally-mandated EMP Commission, which looked into the threat of electromagnetic pulse attacks. He told the website that he had seen a long-suppressed report prepared by the Department of Homeland Security for the Defense Department that apparently concludes that the best defence the U.S had against a North Korean attack would be to destroy the rocket on the launch pad. Threat: Dr Pry was quoted as saying Kim Jong-un is seeing what he can get away with. 'It shows that Pyongyang is planning something big against the U.S.,' he added . This is due to the U.S. having 'no early warning radars or interceptors' to stop a missile from the south, and because the the country also lacks adequate defenses on its east coast, Dr Pry said. An electromagnetic pulse attack involves a nuclear warhead being detonated hundreds of miles above the earth's surface, with the resulting burst of energy disrupting or destroying all electronic devices - including communications, navigation and sensor systems - in the affected area. Such an attack on the U.S. would cripple the country's defence systems, not to mention cause chaos in any scenario where an electronic device is required - including road, sea and air transport, government and civilian communications and, of course, the throughout entire economic sector. The leaked Department of Homeland Security report allegedly claims that North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un already successfully practiced an electromagnetic pulse attack on the U.S. in early 2013. Allegations: Dr Pry's claims come after months of insistence from the administration of U.S. president Barack Obama that North Korea still did not have the capability to attack the U.S. or its allies with nuclear weapons . In spring of that year, tensions on the Korean Peninsula dramatically increased, thanks to North Korea's repeat threats of war - including releasing videos depicting a nuclear attack on Washington. Dr Pry said the DHS report was commissioned as a result of these threats. He also said that in December 2012 a North Korean satellite was tracked above central and eastern U.S., and could have caused nationwide destruction had it been fitted with a nuclear warhead. Dr Pry's claims come months of insistence from the Obama administration that North Korea still did not have . the capability to attack the U.S. or its allies with nuclear weapons. The Department of Homeland Security has not yet responded to Dr Pry's allegations.","Peter Vincent Pry 'has seen' leaked report from Homeland Security .

"Britain faces a legal challenge over its alleged role in supplying information to an American  military ‘kill list’ in Afghanistan. Targeting Taliban leaders and drug traffickers plays a key role in Nato’s strategy in Afghanistan. The existence of the ‘kill list’ was first revealed in a US Senate report in 2009 detailing a new task force linking US and British military with the Drug Enforcement Agency and Britain’s Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca). Shock: After an attack on an Al Qaeda in the North Waziristan tribal region of Pakistan . An Afghan man who lost five relatives in a missile strike has started proceedings against the Soca and the Ministry of Defence, demanding to know the UK’s involvement in the target list. Solicitors Leigh Day & Co have asked Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Soca to provide assurances about Britain’s participation, and whether it complies with UK and international law. Kabul bank worker Habib Rahman lost two brothers, two uncles and his father-in-law in a missile attack on their cars in  September 2010. He launched the legal challenge because . he believes his relatives were unlawfully killed in a case of mistaken . identity during one ‘kill list’ operation. Under attack: Soldiers from the 1st Armored Division pursue insurgents who fired rocket propelled grenades into trucks hauling fuel on Afghanistan's main highway . At the time of the attack, the Inter-national Security Assistance Forces said it was a ‘precision air strike’ which killed ‘eight to 12 insurgents’, including a  Taliban commander. Mr Rahman says the deadly strike happened while they were helping a cousin who was campaigning in the run-up to Afghanistan’s elections. Leigh Day & Co acknowledge they do not know whether information provided by the UK contributed to the attack but say they hope the legal challenge will force officials to be more open about the British contribution to the ‘kill list’. Destruction: Afghan villagers stand outside a house hit by a Nato airstrike in June that claimed 15 lives . Rosa Curling, from Leigh Day & Co, said: ‘At a time when the UK Government is arguing that our presence in Afghanistan is needed to bring stability to the country and to establish and maintain the rule of law, ensuring that the UK Government and its agencies themselves are operating within their legal obligations could not be more important. Deadly: A US army Kiowa Warrior helicopter fires a rocket in Afghanistan . ‘Our client’s case suggests that the establishment and maintenance of the “killing list” is not in line with the UK’s duties under international humanitarian law. ‘Our client lost five of his relatives in an attack by the international military forces as a result of this list. ‘It is important that the MoD and Soca provide us with the reassurances sought, to make sure that others do not suffer the tragic loss of life as experienced by Mr Rahman.’ The MoD said it could not discuss the case in detail but stressed it worked ‘strictly within the bounds of international law’. A Soca spokesman said: ‘Soca does not discuss intelligence. Soca works strictly within the bounds of international law.’ ■ Three US special forces soldiers were shot and killed by a follower of the Taliban dressed in an Afghan uniform after he lured them to a breakfast meeting yesterday in the Sangin district of Helmand province. A fourth man was injured in the attack, the latest in a series by Afghan soldiers or police who are supposedly taking over responsibility for security once Nato forces go in 2014. The Taliban claimed the killer – who invited the soldiers to his checkpoint for  a pre-dawn Ramadan meal – had been  helping US forces to train police, but was now working for them.","Habib Rahman lost five relatives in a rocket attack .

"A relative of al-Qaeda fantatic Mohammed Merah has said he is 'very proud' his brother for killing seven people, including three children. Abdelkader Merah, 29, who was arrested over alleged terror offences told police he was 'very proud of my brother. I regret nothing for him and approve of what he did.' Police are trying to determine whether the 24-year-old acted alone or had any help in carrying out the murders, which shocked France. Wounded: A policeman is taken from the raid between police and terrorist Mohammed Merah who was gunned down after a 32-hour siege . Merah's brother, Abdelkader, was flown to Paris for further questioning, along with his girlfriend, but a lawyer for Merah's mother, 55-year-old Zoulika Aziri, said she had been released without charge. Jean-Yves Gougnaud told reporters in the southern French city of Toulouse that Aziri's world had been 'turned upside down.' 'She is devastated,' he told reporters after her release. 'At no time could she have imagined that her son was the one who did it.' Merah, who claimed allegiance to al-Qaeda, died in a hail of gunfire on Thursday after a dramatic 32-hour standoff with police at his apartment in Toulouse. At one point, police brought his mother to the scene, but she refused to urge her son to surrender, officials said. Merah had filmed himself carrying out attacks in southern France that began March 11 and killed three Jewish schoolchildren, a rabbi and three French paratroopers with close-range shots to the head, prosecutors say. Injured officers are being taken away on stretchers. Merah was corned in his flat and shot dead on Thursday . Arrested: Meanwhile police applied to detain Merah's elder brother, 29-year-old Abdelkader Merah, in custody for a further day . Another Jewish student and a paratrooper were wounded, and five police officers were injured trying to dislodge Merah from the apartment. The pregnant girlfriend of a French soldier killed in a dramatic gun rampage will marry her partner in a posthumous ceremony, a family lawyer says. Lawyer Gilbert Collard says that 21-year-old Caroline Monet will marry Abel Chennouf, who was shot dead at a cash machine in the town of Montauban near Toulouse earlier this month. The 25-year-old soldier was one of seven people allegedly gunned down by Merah. Collard says Monet has received preliminary approval from the president's office for the ceremony. Such ceremonies are unusual but not unheard of in France, where the law allow posthumous marriages in cases where a fiance dies before the wedding. The law states that such weddings can only be approved by the French president 'in grave circumstances'. 'I've already had it done twice, for policemen's girlfriends,' Collard said. 'It's a really moving ceremony, with an empty chair representing the dead spouse.' Collard said the official request was being sent today, but that he'd already received the nod from the French president's office. 'There won't be any problems,' Collard said, adding that he hopes the ceremony will 'let the child have a father'. Investigators are trying to figure out whether Merah, a Frenchman of Algerian descent, acted alone. Key questions include how Merah, described by French intelligence boss Ange Mancini as 'a little failure from the suburbs', was able to amass an arsenal of weapons - including an Uzi sub-machinegun - and rent a car, despite having no clear source of income. Mr Mancini told French broadcaster BFMTV that Merah told police during the siege that he bought the weapons for 20,000 euros, using money he acquired through break-ins and holdups. He said he believed that Merah was telling the truth about that, but suggested that forensic police would be examining the guns for clues as to where Merah got them. 'The weapons, too, will talk,' Mr Mancini said. Merah had claimed that neither his . mother nor his brother knew of his plans, but police union spokesman . Christophe Crepin told reporters that detectives have already gathered . evidence to suggest that Abdelkader may have helped his brother carry . out the shootings. Asked what police had on the brother, Mr . Crepin said there was evidence to suggest that Abdelkader had . 'furnished means [and] worked as an accomplice.' Mr Crepin refused to comment further, . saying it was for a judge to decide what charges, if any, to bring. Under French law if either of the two continue to be held beyond the . weekend, preliminary charges will have to be filed. Abdelkader had already come under . police radar, according to officials. He was questioned several years . ago about alleged links to a network sending Toulouse-area youths to . Iraq, but no action was brought against him at the time. Merah was gunned down by special forces police on Thursday after three separate attacks which saw four die at a Jewish school, along with three soldiers from ethnic minorities who had fought in Afghanistan . High alert: French police surrounded Merah's flat for 32 hours as he refused to surrender . Back in the southern French city of Toulouse, where Merah held out in an apartment building for more than a day against one of France's most elite police units, residents were beginning to return home to inspect the damage. Video footage shot by police of the inside of Merah's apartment showed a shattered three-room residence strewn with debris from the fighting and gaping bullet holes in the walls. Building resident Farida Bohama was quoted by France's Le Figaro newspaper as saying nothing would ever be the same. 'I really want to move,' she said. Meanwhile pictures have emerged of injured police officers being brought out of Thursday's raid in Toulouse in which Merah was shot dead. Four police were wounded in the 32-hour siege and one was shown being stretched away. An English teacher has sparked outrage across France yesterday after calling for her pupils to observe a minute’s silence for Merah. In disturbing scenes at Gustave Flaubert High School in Rouen, Normandy, Lorraine Collin, 56, described the terrorist as being the ‘victim of an unhappy childhood’. This prompted up to 15 pupils aged between 17 and 18 to storm out of their classroom and report Ms Collin to their headmaster. Shocking: At Gustave Flaubert High School in Normandy, Lorraine Collin, 56, described the 23-year-old who murdered seven including three children as himself being the 'victim of an unhappy childhood' Upset: Her instruction prompted up to 15 pupils aged between 17 and 18 to storm out of their classroom and report Ms Collin to their headmaster . Luc Chatel, France’s Education Minister, called for Ms Collin to be ‘suspended immediately’, saying he ‘condemned this unspeakable behaviour without reservation’.Ms Collin drew attention to the fact that Merah was from a disadvantaged French-Algerian immigrant background and had been drawn to Islamic extremism while serving a prison sentence. Merah said he had shot three youngsters at the Jewish school in Toulouse on Monday in revenge for Palestinian children killed by the Israeli Army. Referring to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Ms Collin even said that Merah’s links with Al-Qaeda had been ‘invented by the media and Sarko.’ It was only when her students began to leave, or to argue with her, that she appeared to back down, saying she was ‘not feeling too well and perhaps take some time off.’ Ms Collin’s comments were soon afterwards reported by the Paris Normandie news website, who quoted an unnamed parent saying: ‘The students acted as responsible citizens by leaving the classroom. They hope the teacher will be suspended. Respect: Hundreds of people participate in a minute of silence to pay tribute to the victims of the Toulouse school and three French soldiers, at the Capitol square in Toulouse, France . ‘Otherwise, I will give permission for my daughter to boycott English classes until the end of the year.’ A spokesman for the school said what happened was a ‘sad incident’, and that a disciplinary procedure was underway. Among rising concerns that extremists like Merah could threaten countries like Britain, European security officials warned of a Jidhadist threat which was becoming harder to track down. Europol chief Rob Wainwright saod: ‘We have a different kind of jihadist threat emerging and it's getting stronger. It is much more decentralized and harder to track.’ Meanwhile hundreds of people participated in a minute of silence to pay tribute to the victims of the Toulouse school and three French soldiers, at the Capitol square in Toulouse, France.","Mohammed Merah's brother Abdelkader and his girlfriend arrested by police .

"Nearly 70 years after the end of the Second World War, the name of Bletchley Park is etched in the nation's consciousness. For many it is synonymous with spying, code-breaking, intelligence and subterfuge, the place where Britain's best brains were pushed to the limit of their capabilities to undermine the relentless German war machine. Yet Bletchley, in Buckinghamshire, was just one of countless stately homes across Britain without which the nation's ability to counter the Nazi threat would have been so much the weaker. Soldiers at the Catsle Howard in the film Brideshead Revisited . As conflict became inevitable and all attempts at appeasement failed, country houses such as Bletchley were commandeered in their thousands for the war effort and transformed into hospitals, schools, barracks, listening and monitoring centres, military command headquarters and stores for national art treasures - even, in one case, accommodation for displaced royalty. Badminton House, in Gloucestershire, became the wartime home of the country's most distinguished evacuee, Queen Mary, mother of the reigning monarch, King George VI. Its owners, the Duke and Duchess of Beaufort, were allocated two bedrooms and a sitting room while the royal visitor, who arrived in true diva style in September 1939 with 50 staff and more than 70 pieces of luggage, had the run of the rest of the house. Hitherto an entirely urban dweller, Queen Mary grew to love the rural life, once remarking to her niece during a stroll in the countryside, 'Is that what hay looks like? I never knew.' Keeping up standards became part of Her Majesty's self-imposed war work. A fellow inhabitant of Badminton describes an emergency visit to the great house's underground air raid shelter. 'There I was in the middle of the night with my hair all anyhow and in a filthy old dressing gown; and there in the shelter sat Queen Mary, perfectly dressed with her pearls, doing a crossword puzzle. I never did that again.' Troops at Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorshire . From a potentially uneasy mix of military and civilian personnel, aristocrats and London evacuees, lifelong bonds and friendships were formed. Longleat, the seat of the Marquess of Bath in Wiltshire, became a refuge for the girls from the Royal School in Bath, and the octogenarian aristocrat delighted in attending concerts given by them as well as pottering around the grounds with his young visitors in the company of his ancient dog. The girls, in turn, became fond of their venerable host, according to a diary kept by Rosemary Ellis, the art mistress. When Lord Bath died just after the war the girls paid their respects, forming a guard of honour on the front steps when his coffin left the house. The deaf and elderly Lord Newton at Lyme Park, in Cheshire, was equally delighted to share his vast ancestral home with 40 evacuee children from Manchester. As a change from his habitual rather solitary existence, he spent much of the war sitting by a roaring log fire with an assortment of his guests, a 'lot of dogs', according to reports, and his drinks table. Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire, the birthplace and ancestral home of Britain's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill, also played host to a school – in this case the displaced pupils of Malvern College in Worcestershire. But their stay was a brief one. In the autumn of 1940 Blenheim was taken over by MI5, which moved there from another temporary home, Wormwood Scrubs prison in west London. The state rooms were divided up into offices for the national security service and filled with filing cabinets and trestle tables. Soldiers being nursed in one of the halls of Harfield House . Nissen huts and Army trucks took over the magnificent forecourt. Although supposedly top secret, the identity of the palace's new occupants soon became common knowledge, the conductors on local buses habitually calling out 'Anyone for MI5?' when they reached Blenheim's gates. Hatfield House, in Hertfordshire, became a military hospital where badly injured soldiers were sent to recover in mind and body, with the lovely architecture and gardens providing part of the cure. Pictures from the time show nurses and patients getting lost together in the estate's magnificent maze. Margaret, Countess of Lichfield, whose home, Heath House in Staffordshire, fulfilled a similar function, wrote, 'The patients had the free run of the place and loved and respected it. It seemed to bring the best out in them - they came out of hell and found themselves in heaven.' Rufford Abbey, in Nottinghamshire, was one of several stately homes in the Midlands used as prisoner-of-war camps, the location being around 60 miles from the coast and thus thought to be off-putting to potential absconders. Not that Rufford's occupants showed much interest in escaping, if local memories are to be believed. Most of them were Italian soldiers who spent their time falling in love with the local girls, stripping the silk damask from the walls of the historic mansion to make gifts and keepsakes for their sweethearts. Penrhyn Castle in Caernarvonshire was chosen to house the treasures of the National Gallery, largely because its stable doors were tall enough to admit Van Dyck's equestrian portrait of Charles I. But even then the priceless artworks were not immune from risk. In a letter to his boss in London, assistant keeper Martin Davies wrote, 'For your most secret ear, one of our troubles at Penrhyn Castle is that the owner is celebrating the war by being fairly constantly drunk. He stumbled with a dog into the dining room (where many of the paintings were being restored) a few days ago; this will not happen again.' Longleat House, became a refuge for the girls from the Royal School in Bath . Once described as one of the most important artistic properties in England, Wilton House, near Salisbury in Wiltshire, had been used as a military hospital during the First World War before becoming a magnet for painters, writers and socialites during the 20s and 30s. These included Cecil Beaton, who was on hand at the beginning of the Second World War to photograph some of the 40 nursery school children who arrived in 1939 during the first wave of evacuations from the capital, as they played on the cedar-shaded lawns. Wilton's war was not, however, a happy one. In June 1940 the nursery children were moved on and the house was requisitioned as the Army's Southern Command headquarters. It was in one of Wilton's reception rooms that the D-day landings were planned - the paintings by Rembrandt, Tintoretto, Breughel, Rubens and Joshua Reynolds that had lined its walls having been stacked away in the mansion's cellars. But as in so many requisitioned properties, the military invasion took a toll. As a result of the traffic of soldiers' feet, its magnificent Gothic staircase gave way with an almighty crash early one morning in June 1941. Such dramas were repeated all over the country. Staircases were chopped up for firewood; paintings and panelling used as dart boards; jeeps and armoured vehicles driven into lakes and up staircases; gardens concreted over; statues beheaded and conservatories machine-gunned. Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire, which was housing a battalion, also had its gardens and park torn up and compulsorily open-cast mined for coal, causing horrendous structural damage. In an extravagant good-riddance gesture to the wartime years, departing troops at Egginton Hall in Derbyshire left all the taps on, bringing the ceilings down, rotting the woodwork and forcing its demolition. In West Sussex, Arundel Castle's herd of red deer was shot and eaten. Perhaps unfairly, the Canadian soldiers stationed in the south of England took the blame for much of the damage – perhaps it was easier for locals to blame foreign troops rather than their own. The major portion of beautiful Georgian Shillinglee Park, also in West Sussex, was gutted by Canadian troops during a party in 1943. At Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire soldiers carved their names, addresses and numbers in the balustrade of the elegant bridge in the park. And yet despite the dreadful loss of . such a significant swathe of Britain's heritage, the majority of houses . were restored and survived . Even without vandalism, fire was a hazard at a time when virtually everybody smoked. Dozens of country houses were burned to the ground, others were left in such poor condition in 1945 that they seemed beyond restoration. Without proper maintenance, pipes burst, ceilings collapsed and dry rot rampaged. A staggering 1,000 country houses were demolished in the decade between 1945 and 1955 as a result of wartime mistreatment - the destruction has been compared to the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century. And yet despite the dreadful loss of such a significant swathe of Britain's heritage, the majority of houses were restored and survived. Beginning with Chatsworth, in Derbyshire, Longleat and Arundel in 1947, an increasing number threw open their doors to the public. Not only did this make them eligible for repair grants, but it also gave them a vital means of upkeep too. Nearly all the larger houses that took this step survived and flourished. Two or three generations on, they have been fully refurbished and brought back to life, and it is now hard to recall the state they were in following the end of hostilities. Others, such as Chicksands Priory in Bedfordshire and Southwick in Hampshire, remained in military use. As for Bletchley Park, the outbreak of war in 1939 saw an unexpected reversal in its fortunes. It had been scheduled for demolition in the late 30s to make way for a new suburb as part of what is now Milton Keynes. But so great was its fame following its requisitioning that its longtime survival, now as a museum, was ensured. A grateful nation took it to their hearts, and there it has remained. Like so many of Britain's other stately homes - even those with histories going back centuries - the war years really were its finest hour.

"A huge number of fathers are missing important milestones in their children's lives due to increasing hours and hefty workloads. Almost two thirds (62 per cent) have missed a parents' evening, while one in five couldn't attend their child's last school sports day. It also emerged that just under one third of fathers have missed 'most' or 'all' of their child's Christmas plays and a fifth said they were 'lucky' if they caught one bath time a month. More than half of fathers miss first steps and first words - and it's reportedly due to increasing hours at work . A similar figure confessed they have no idea what their child's favourite book is due to missing their bed-times when working late, according to a new study of 1,000 UK fathers of children aged 16 and under. A significant 53 per cent of fathers have missed out on big milestones in their children's lives such as first steps, first words and even school awards ceremonies. The average father loses out on three significant family events every month, but feels regret over missing smaller events such as baths or reading-time as often as twice a week. And six in ten confessed to only spending quality time with their children at weekends, with 'long working hours' and being 'too knackered' averting them from valuable family time. Too much overtime and travelling for business were other top reasons for missing week nights at home, with the gym and other commitments also getting in the way. And for fathers who do eventually get home, a shattered one in ten confessed to hitting the hay as soon as they get through the door, whilst others stated they just want some time to themselves after a hard day at work. Fathers are missing out on sports days and bath times - but research shows quality time helps development . The sofa is the prime location for most tired dads, who will usually spend their evening in front of the TV with a beer or a glass of wine. But the many evenings dads spend recuperating doesn't make them happy, the results showed. Many of the hard-working fathers said they find it difficult to maintain a work-life balance, and over half have questioned whether their career is worth the time they miss out on at home. And sadly, a considerable 32 per cent of the dads polled said there were still many playtime activities they have never done due to being busy with their careers. And almost one in ten said that although they want to, they have never dressed up as their child's favourite character, gone kite-flying or taught them to swim. The poll found over one in eight have never gotten around to building their kids a den or tree house, whilst others haven't cheered on at their kids' football matches. Going on long walks, playing pretend and visiting the cinema were among the top playtime activities dads wished they could do more of with their children, as well as reading comics, sleeping outside in a tent and playing board games. A number of fathers claimed that if they had more time they would help their children to ride a bike, invent science experiments and teach them self-defence techniques, whilst over a fifth would enjoy improving on their kids' football skills. Many felt that if they were there to cheer them on at events and spend time with them when they got home from school, it would improve the relationship between them. But despite their regrets, fathers had good intentions behind their absence - the research showed that a massive six in ten thought that putting his job first is an unavoidable factor to supporting a happy family. A spokesman for notonthehighstreet.com, which carried out the study, said: 'We all know it can often be difficult to be home regularly, and it seems this is especially true of the UK's busy dads - try as they might, missing out on quality family time is sometimes unavoidable. 'The pressure to meet deadlines at work balanced with the knowledge that you're losing out on precious memories can be hugely frustrating and challenging. 'The results show that modern dads certainly are under stress and strains by putting in normal working hours and more, whilst also trying to make birthday parties or parents' evenings.' 'It's clear from this study into modern UK fathers that working hours are a real constraint on family life. It's only as we get older that we realise the lengths our parents go to ensure that we have a great childhood. And with Fathers' Day coming up it's a great opportunity to treat the nations dads and show our gratitude.' Notonthehighstreet.com want to encourage dads to launch their own flexible, creative business and tap into their passions and hobbies as an alternative to the 9 to 5 . Notonthehighstreet.com has launched a project called the Dadpreneur Movement to help shine a light on the issues and challenges facing the modern working father. The company has teamed up with working fathers like Olympic gold medalist James Cracknell and Michelin starred chef and owner of The Social Company Jason Atherton to discuss the issues. Cracknell and Atherton will form part of a panel aimed at getting dads to get their creative juices flowing in order to achieve success whilst also maintaining a healthier worklife balance and making sure they have one on one bonding time with their kids at the same time. A notonthehighstreet.comspokesperson said: 'Through our Dadpreneur Movement we want to encourage dads to launch their own flexible, creative business and tap into their passions and hobbies as an alternative to the 9 to 5.' Psychotherapist Phil Hodson, who will also be on the panel of working fathers, says: 'Numerous studies have shown the benefits of play for children. A dad spending time with his children and participating in creative play is invaluable to a child's development. Not only does it have huge emotional benefits, it can help with cognitive development, social development and physical development.'","Six in ten fathers only spend quality time with their children at weekends .

"A  male burqa-clad Taliban militant has been arrested at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan after his unconvincing disguise failed to trick immigration officials. The tall, bearded man was spotted by Afghan Border Police at the Torkham checkpoint which separates Nangarhar province in Afghanistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. Accompanied by another male militant, . the man wore a brown burqa covering his face and body, over a blue . collared shirt and a black salwar kameez, which is traditional Afghan . dress for men. The tall, bearded Taliban militant failed to dupe Afghan border officials at Torkham with his ill-fitting burqa . The burqa appeared too short for the militant, revealing his shoes, ankles and clothes underneath. He wore black men's boots and underneath his veil the man had a full beard - which is deemed a religious requirement by the Taliban. The Taliban militant was caught by Afghan Border Police . Unsurprisingly, his outfit failed to dupe border police, who arrested him and took him to their headquarters in Jalalabad, Nangarhar province, east of Kabul. The man, who has not been named, was presented to the public in order to discourage others from attempting similar ploys to outsmart border police. He towered over the guards supervising him and his face remained obscured as the burqa was pulled up to reveal his beard. His companion, who wore traditional Afghan men's clothing, was also arrested and brought before the media while blindfolded and accompanied by armed guards. Traditional Afghan dress for women varies between regions and ethnicities and can be very colourful. But as burqas are full-length garments which cover most of the body, it is possible one of the reasons the militant was caught out was due to the fact that part of his burqa fell above the knee because of his height.","Taliban militant wore an ill-fitting burqa in a bid to cross the Afghan border .

"Britain's contributions to the European Union have topped £50 million a day for the first time, new figures revealed last night. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the UK’s contributions to Brussels rose by 5.7 per cent last year to a record £18.5 billion – double the Home Office Budget. At the same time, the money Britain received back from the EU fell by almost a quarter to £8.1 billion, a fall of £2.6 billion in a year. Rocketing bill: UK contributions to Brussels rose by 5.7 per cent last year to a record £18.5billion . The trends meant that that the UK’s net contribution to Brussels rocketed by 54 per cent to £10.3 billion. Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party last night said the figures would ‘rub salt in the wounds’ of people pressing for a referendum on Britain’s relationship with the EU. Mr Farage said: ‘The figures speak for themselves. We are paying more than ever before for our EU membership and are getting less in return. ‘This news is a kick in the teeth for the British people who are tightening their belts in these tough times.’ Fury: Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party, said 'we are paying more than ever before for our EU membership and are getting less in return' The figures are likely to strengthen the hand of Tory Eurosceptics who argue that Britain is getting a raw deal from the EU. They are also potentially embarrassing for David Cameron, who has just agreed a two per cent budget increase for the European Commission next year, which will cost British taxpayers an extra £300 million. The Prime Minister has said his focus now is to prevent a major rise in the EU’ s budget for the seven-year period after 2014. The new figures relate to the calendar year 2010. Britain’s gross contributions increased partly because of the decline in the value of the pound against the euro. The dramatic decline in receipts from the EU results mainly from a controversial deal struck by Tony Blair to hand back part of the annual rebate famously secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Under the terms of the 1984 deal Britain is repaid two thirds of the difference between what it pays out to Brussels and what it receives back. Last year this was worth £5 billion. But under the new arrangement struck by Mr Blair the formula no longer apply to billions of pounds of the EU budget used to fund regeneration projects in poorer member states such as Greece and the former communist regimes in Eastern Europe. The new figures also suggest the the Office for Budget Responsibility is likely to have underestimated the future cost of the EU. The OBR’s latest forecast is for our net contributions to the EU to hit the £10.3 billion mark in 2014.","Our contribution to Brussels rose by 5.7% last year .

"An Australian company has developed a series of wines based on Game of Thrones, inspired by not just the show but the intensity of watching episodes of the bloody fantasy series. Common Ventures is the Australia company who masterminded the project, and said they were surprised by how influenced they were by the character's drinking habits. The Wines of Westeros feature 12 red and white varieties with names including The Wildling, The Stark, The Lannister and The Dothraki. An Australian company has unveiled a dozen Game Of Thrones inspired wines . 'After our favourite characters had scaled the wall, we were left with the idea to brand and create a wine for each of our favourite houses and their heroes,' Jane Burhop from Common Ventures told AAP. 'The sigil and variant of each bottle directly reflects the personality of each house. The reds are all associated with the houses that are head strong and robust. The whites on the other hand are more cunning, perceptive and mysterious.' It's also designed for those hard-to-watch episodes, for anyone thinking of re-watching The Red Wedding. 'This wine is made to be drunk with friends and to help soften the blow of the shock and heartache as our favourite characters are slowly killed off,' Burhop said. The range is based on the 12 houses in the show, and there are six red and six white drops . The company are still in talks with some smaller independent Australian wineries to secure 'the perfect grapes for your goblets'. Although The HBO series has inspired a plethora of merchandise, this appears to be the first alcoholic kind. Common Ventures said they created the range as massive fans of the show. They are hoping the wine's launch will coincide with the fifth season premiere of Game of Thrones in 2015, with the bottles to be sold at Australian independent liquor stores and online. Wines include The Lannister (left) and The White Walker (right) 'This however will be dependant of how long it takes our ships to cross the Narrow sea,' Burhop said. The bottles are expected to sell around the $20 mark, which roughly equates to four pieces of gold dragon. The full range boasts six white whines, The Arryn, The Greyjoy, The Stark, The Tyrell, The White Walker and The Wilding. Half a dozen reds make up the full 12 houses on the show, named The Baratheon, The Dothraki, The Lannister, The Martell, The Night's Watch and The Targaryen.","Common Ventures developed a series of wines based on the HBO series .

"Spain's high-class escorts are refusing to have sex with the nation's bankers - until they open up credit lines to cash-strapped families and firms. Madrid's top-end prostitutes say their indefinite strike will continue until bank employees 'fulfil their responsibility to society' and start offering bigger loans for struggling Spaniards, it has been claimed. Sneaky bankers were trying to circumvent the protest by claiming to be architects or engineers, the sex-workers said. On strike: Spain's high-class escorts are refusing to have sex with the nation's bankers until they open up credit lines to cash-strapped families and firms (file picture) Plans: A general strike, like this one in Barcelona in 2010, is taking place across Spain on Thursday in protest against austerity measures . But this was 'not fooling anyone' because, as one escort revealed: 'It has been many years since these professionals could afford rates that start from €300 per hour.' The capital's largest luxury prostitute trade association, which is reportedly initiating the strike, said: 'We are the only ones with a real ability to pressure the sector. 'We have been on strike for three days now and we don't think they can withstand much more,' added the woman, known as Ana MG. It said the move came after one of its members, Lucia, pressured a bank employee client to grant a loan by halting her 'sexual services'. Tough talker: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy (left) said he will still pass an austere budget on Friday, the day after thousands will take to the streets as part of a general strike (right) Mexican website SDPnoticias.com, who was joined by Russia Today in breaking the news which some have claimed is a 'hoax', reported that the bankers became so desperate they called in the government for mediation. The strikes also come as Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy promised this week to stick to a tough budget. This was despite a surprise setback in . a regional election he had hoped would reinforce his mandate for . spending cuts to improve public finances. His PP party won the Socialist . stronghold of Andalucia in Sunday's vote but did not secure the outright . majority that was expected and that would have reinforced his mandate . to make savings. But Rajoy said he would still present a tough 2012 budget for this year on Friday. He must set out how Spain will cut the public deficit to 5.3% of its output this year, from 8.51% last year. 'We will pass a very, very austere budget,' he told reporters in South Korea, where he was attending a nuclear summit. Rajoy's reforms have won some public . support from voters who want to make sure Spain is not forced to ask for . a bailout like neighbouring Portugal. The sex-worker strike comes as Spain is . set to be hit by a general strike on Thursday in protest at high . unemployment and changes to labour laws that make it cheaper for firms . to lay off workers. Train, bus and air traffic will be severely limited as unions, which represent one in five Spanish workers, agreed to retain minimum transport services. It will mean only 20 per cent of flights between Spanish and other European airports. The government's labour market reform is just the latest in a series of measures Spain has taken in the last two years to try to make its economy more competitive. Doubts about Spain's public finances have pushed up the state's borrowing costs, forcing the government to drastically cut spending to reduce the public deficit. At the same time, unemployment has soared to a staggering 23 per cent and the economy is heading into its second recession in three years. A general strike in 2010 had limited impact - mostly on transport and manufacturing - but this week's walkout could bring a bigger turnout because the jobless rate has increased significantly. Also, in 2010 the Socialists were in power, and now the centre-right People's Party is in office. Traditionally, the unions have had a political alliance with the Socialists so protests have been more muted during periods of Socialist rule. In a country where people depend heavily on public transport to get to work, the unions depend on cutting transport services to obtain maximum impact from a strike.","Top-end prostitutes say strike to continue until bankers offer credit .

"As New Year's Eve approaches, so does the prospect of the dreaded next-day hangover. But from Victoria Beckham's bee pollen smoothies to Miranda Kerr crediting South East Asian noni juice for her flawless complexion, it seems there is more to treating a delicate head and sensitive stomach than relying on a fry-up and hair of the dog. We've asked holistic nutritionist Nikki Baker to sort the quinoa from the chaff and talk us through the new superfoods expected to be big in 2015 - and how they'll help us on the morning after. Models like Miranda Kerr, left) and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley add superfood ingredients to their green juices . Ingredient: Moringa . Celebrity fans: Lily Cole and Livia Firth . Best for: Liver protection and blood sugar regulation . Most popular in powder form, this superfood is made from the leaf of the moringa ‘miracle' tree, native to Africa and Asia and one of the most nutrient-dense plants on the planet. It has been claimed that it boosts immunity, lowers blood pressure, alleviates stress, fights fatigue, improves digestive health and increases libido. And that's just on the inside. It's also a tonic for hair, nails and skin. So what makes moringa so miraculous? It contains almost 25 per cent protein, including all nine of the essential amino acids, which are important for the body's key functions and help maintain healthy skin cells. It is also packed with essential vitamins and minerals, including skin-supporting vitamins such as zinc, which includes strong, supple healthy skin, nails and hair among its beauty benefits. Nikki Baker advises: 'Moringa has six times the antioxidant content of the popular superfood, goji berries. It contains over 90 nutrients, 46 antioxidants and abundant minerals. 'Gram for gram, Moringa contains more vitamin B12 than steak, more vitamin A than eggs, and more calcium than milk. 'Its antioxidants detox and protect the liver, boost immunity and support healthy blood sugar levels.' The powdered leaves of the moringa tree can boost immunity, lower blood pressure and increase libido . Ingredient: Mushrooms . High profile fans: Kelly Osbourne and Katy Perry . Best for: Adrenal recovery and digestion . According to Nikki, mushrooms are big news for 2015. But these aren’t the kind of fungi you’ll find in the veg section of the supermarket. These medicinal mushrooms have powerful antioxidant properties that can help bring you back on track following a heavy night. One such example is chaga, a hard black fungus which has been central to folk medicine in northern climates for centuries and is dubbed the mushroom of immortality in Siberia. Nikki said: 'Chaga is a nutrient-rich medicinal mushroom, it grows on the birch tree and so harnesses the amazing nutrient properties of this tree. Some mushrooms have digestion-calming properties - important after a big night out . 'Chaga contains numerous B vitamins, flavonoids, minerals and enzymes. 'It is also one of the world’s densest sources of pantothenic acid, an  essential nutrient needed by the adrenal glands as well as digestive organs.' Ingredient: Chlorella . High profile fans: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Miranda Kerr, Millie Mackintosh . Best for: Liver detoxification and healthy protein delivery . We’ve all seen supermodels sipping on green juices containing chlorella this year but as Nikki stresses, there’s more to this trend than just a fad, especially when it comes to the morning after. The one to look out for, she says, is Sun Chlorella A, a green algae and superfood detoxifier, popular in Japan. In 1996, research from Sapporo Medical University, Japan, suggested that chlorella, a freshwater green algae, can lessen hangover symptoms by up to 96 per cent if taken before drinking. The idea is that the antioxidant-packed algae neutralises the free radicals (chemicals that damage cells) in alcohol. Chlorella - which also contains iron, folic acid and energy-boosting B vitamins - is also lauded for its gut-soothing properties, as it dissolves and expands to coat the stomach when eaten. Fans include Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who adds it to her daily green juice, along with Miranda Kerr, Victoria Beckham and Millie Mackintosh, to name a few. Grown in the Amazon Rainforest and the high Andes mountains of Peru, nut-like sacha inchi seeds are even thought to  aid weight loss . Ingredient: Sacha inchi . High profile fans: Dr Mehmet Oz . Best for: Protein-filled morning after snacks . After a festive night out, it can be tempting to spend the next day grazing on high fat foods to feel better. But as Nikki explains, there’s a much healthier alternative to fill the stomach - sacha inchi seeds. Speaking about the peanut-like seed, she said: 'One of the richest sources in the world of omega fatty acids, sacha Inchi are also loaded with protein, fibre and antioxidants. 'In the Amazon Rainforest in Peru, the ingredient has been cultivated by indigenous people for centuries.' U.S. television host Dr Mehmet Oz also included sacha inchi on his list of Best and Worst of 2010 - Your Guide as the best weight-loss snack. He claimed that they are loaded with vitamin E, omega-3s fatty acids and have anti-inflammatory properties that can attack stomach fat. If you're looking to carry on the celebrations but still want to reap the benefits of superfoods, Europe's first  bar dedicated to superfood cocktails has opened its doors and the new range of tasty tipples may even hinder a hangover. Tanya's Cafe, located within the MyHotel in Chelsea, was the brainchild of raw food specialist and wellness coach, Tanya Maher. Speaking to FEMAIL about her bar, which mixes organic spirits with only superfoods and cold-pressed juices, Tanya said: 'The menu is designed to reflect your busy schedule and provide loving nourishment at all times of the day. 'You can get your morning green juice, which is cold pressed and organic or a pour-over coffee with hazelnut milk, a satisfyingly delicious plant-based burger and decadent raw chocolate cake for lunch. 'Then come evening you could share a vibrant cashew cheese platter and superfood-packed cocktails, that are made with only top quality, vegan and ethically sourced alcohol. 'Everything is organic, hand picked and raw.' One of her most popular requests is a drink called What The Doctor Ordered, a combination of vodka, lemon, beetroot, carrot, sweet potato, raw honey, ginger, lavender and chia seeds. Another cocktail on offer includes a combination of walnut-infused vodka, fresh cherries, cacao powder (packed with antioxidants and magnesium), acai berry (used by athletes for stamina), vanilla bitters and maple syrup. There's also a tipple full of the sugar cane spirit cachaca shaken up with lime, coconut palm sugar and maca powder (from a Peruvian root), well known for its energy-boosting properties. So are the cocktails, which cost around £10, too good to be true? Tipper Lewis, Head Herbalist at Neal’s Yard Remedies, said: 'Promoting good health while drinking alcohol may seem counterproductive, however by adding superfoods to the mix it offers a revolutionary healthy spin on some of our most celebratory drinks. 'By using superfoods, the most nutrient-dense ingredients nature has to offer, you can transform even the most empty calorie cocktails into health-boosting mixtures packed full of antioxidants, minerals and vitamins. 'There are superfoods for every season, and the accessibility of superfoods makes these cocktails readily available for even the novice bartender. 'Since there is always an in-season option, finding innovative ingredients with health giving benefits for cocktails is a breeze.'","Models Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whitely swear by superfoods .

"Strewn with litter, smothered in mould, this is the squalid home where a charity worker kept three dogs and four cats for up to 10 years. Dorothy Harland, 58, was a founding member of the Emergency Animal Rescue Service (EARS) in Ripon, North Yorkshire. But as she spent her days urging people to take in neglected animals, her own were left suffering in a decrepit house. Horrendous: Three dogs and four cats lived for up to ten years in this home in Harrogate, North Yorkshire . The conditions were so horrendous that officers who eventually discovered the hovel could not stay inside for more than a minute without gas masks. Harland, who pleaded guilty to five counts of animal neglect at Harrogate Magistrate's Court, has been barred from keeping animals for ten years and ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work. The court heard the animals tried to burst out of the house when they were eventually discovered on December 14 last year. As police opened the door to the property in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, Charlie, a German-Shepherd cross, leaped out and started running around in circles. Bruno, . a 16-year-old cross-breed, also tried to escape but was too weak to walk . and kept falling over. Medical tests revealed he had suffered a stroke . days before police found them, and vets were forced to put him down. 'Cruel': Jack, a Saluki, was discovered in a rusty cage too small to stand in, with no food or water in sight . Police officers could not stand inside for more than a minute without a gas mask when they found the property . The cobweb-covered living room in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, was discovered by a water contractor . When . RSPCA inspectors arrived later, they discovered a third dog, a Saluki named . Jack who was kept in a rusty cage too small to stand in. There was no food or water in sight. Four cats - Murphy, Molly, Polly and Dolly - were also found amongst the rubbish and broken furniture. RSPCA workers said it was the worst house they had inspecting in 20 years. Sentenced: Animal rights workers Dorothy Harland, 58, has been barred from owning pets for 10 years. She was a founding member of Emergency Animal Rescue Service in Yorkshire . 'It was disgusting, it really was,' said RSPCA inspector Dave Holgate. 'Someone who works with an animal charity should really know better. Somebody working with animals knows what is right and what is wrong, and . that is wrong.' The court heard police were alerted to the animals' suffering by a Yorkshire Water contractor investigating a leak at the house. The officers immediately contacted the RSPCA for emergency support. PC Raheel Akram told the RSPCA in a memo: 'It was astonishing the level of dirt and I had never seen a premises in such an appalling state.' Prosecuting on Wednesday, Andrew Davidson said: 'The conditions had built up over a significant period of time. 'She allowed her attachment to her animals as pets to come before their need to have proper living conditions.' The court heard that Harland, who pleaded guilty to five counts of animal neglect, was suffering from depression and had been living in the appalling conditions alongside her animals. Defending Nick Woodhouse said: 'She doesn't have close family or friends so no-one visited the house. 'Her animals seem to have been a crutch for her, she says animals are her reason for getting up in the morning.' Magistrates . were told that any disqualification order would prevent Harland from . continuing her work with EARS, a charity which has rescued over 130 . dogs. Saved: Jack was taken in by RSPCA inspectors and rehomed, along with German Shepherd cross Charlie and four cats. Another dog, Bruno, had to be put down after tests revealed he had had a stroke . Her friend and colleague at the charity, Margaret Wells told the court: 'She does a great job and I don't think we could do it without her.' Chief Magistrate Michael Poole told Harland: 'From your charity work you were aware that your care was seriously lacking. The RSPCA say it is one of the worst they have seen in years and they were appalled by the state of yours and the animals living accommodation.' He added that Harland cannot apply to the court for the ten-year ban to be removed for at least five years. Placed under a 12 month supervision order, she was also ordered to pay £200 of the £4,000 the RSPCA have spent on bringing the case the court, along with a £60 surcharge. Jack, Charlie and all four cats have since been rehomed.","Dorothy Harland, 58, kept 3 dogs and 4 cats in squalid Harrogate home .

The luggage was heavier than when they arrived in New Zealand thanks to all the presents that had been given to Prince George throughout the trip. And it's not the first time Prince William and Kate have tried to slip under the radar by using a common British name. In 2009, they used the pseudonym Mr and Mrs Smith when booking into a holiday home in Cornwall for William's 27th birthday.

"Travellers heading to this year's Ryder Cup, World Cup and Commonwealth Games are being urged to be on their guard for travel scams as figures show they cost holidaymakers £7million in 2013. Fake airline tickets, bogus accommodation and scam package holidays left a huge dent in the wallets of UK travellers last year - with more than 4,500 holiday booking frauds reports to police. The warning comes in the form of a joint initiative, launched today by ABTA, The City of London Police’s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, and Get Safe Online, alerting holidaymakers to potential dangers. Travel scams: Holidaymakers are being urged to research a company's credentials before booking . Its figures reveal nearly 30 per cent of holiday fraud victims in 2013 were scammed by fake adverts for villas and apartments, with some holidaymakers arriving at their destination to find the property didn't exist. The second most common type of booking fraud is airline tickets (21 per cent), where a traveller pays for a fare and receives a fake ticket, or doesn't receive one at all. The average loss is more than £1,000 per person, with flights to West Africa a particular target. While 17 percent of holiday fraud cases . reported last year were package holiday scams, particularly group, . sports and religious packages. The report highlights the Hajj . pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia and major sporting events such as the Ryder . Cup as particular targets for fraudsters. Victims: Laura and Sean Parks, pictured on their wedding day, were left £1,000 out of pocket . And those heading to this year's World Cup in Brazil, or the Ryder Cup and Commonwealth Games in Scotland are being urged to be on their guard when booking their trips. The report also highlights one couple - Laura and Sean Parks from Thirsk, North Yorkshire, who were left £1,000 out of pocket after booking a Loch Ness Valentine's weekend away, which turned out to be a scam. The couple were . stranded in a blizzard after paying for the break through a professional-looking website, which was advertised on Facebook. However, the scammers had stolen the photos of the accommodation from a legitimate site, and Mr and Mrs Parks arrived in Loch Ness to find they had no accommodation booked. Laura, 21, who had booked the holiday for Sean, 33, a soldier on leave from Afghanistan, said: 'We were left feeling disappointed and angry after discovering the lodges did not exist. We had driven for more than seven hours, so were extremely tired and did not expect something like this to happen. 'It was an upsetting experience and one we hope we will never have again.' Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer . said: 'Group packages can be a particular target for fraudsters because they often involve very large sums of money and have a long lead time between booking and taking the trip. 'With the World Cup, Commonwealth Games and Ryder cup coming up, consumers should be wary of these types of scams. 'We would advise consumers to make sure they book with a reputable company and at the very least, thoroughly research the company to make sure they, and the deals they are promoting, are legitimate.' Scam warning: Sports fans heading to events such as the Ryder Cup are being urged to check their paperwork . NFIB director Detective Superintendent Peter O'Doherty said the internet has changed the way we look for and book our holidays. He added: 'Unfortunately it is also enabling fraudsters to prey upon those looking for that perfect break. 'We . would urge those who have fallen foul of fraudsters to come forward by . contacting Action Fraud to report their loss. By reporting it, victims . are helping the NFIB to identify and effectively target those most . responsible for this damaging and distressing crime.' Get Safe Online chief executive Tony Neate said it was vital for holidaymakers to do their research before booking.

Do your research: Don’t just rely on one review, do a thorough online search to ensure the company’s credentials.
Look for the logo: Check whether the company is a member of a recognised trade body such as ABTA. You can verify membership of ABTA online, at www.abta.com .
Stay safe online: Check the web address is legitimate and has not been altered by slight changes to a domain name – such as going from .co.uk to .org .
Pay safe: Never pay directly into an owner's bank account. Paying by direct bank transfer is like paying by cash – the money cannot be traced and is not refundable. Where possible, pay by credit card, (or a debit card that offers protection).
Check paperwork: You should study receipts, invoices and terms and conditions, and beware of any companies that don’t provide any at all.
Use your instincts: If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

"As a designer who's famed for her lady-like glamour and pared down pieces it came as quite a shock to see shrimp emblazoned kimonos making an appearance on Temperley's SS15 catwalk. Attended by a host of celebrity fans including Nicole Scherzinger, Pixie Lott and Anna Friel, Alice Temperley's latest collection presented something of a turnaround from her traditional presentations. The 39-year-old British designer called her newest line an 'evolution at Temperley London' as the range sees the high-end design merge with Alice's diffusion line Alice by Temperley. Alice Temperley showcased a relaxed collection of silk Kimonos and flat trainers with Japanese influence including this silk coat which featured a large prawn motif on the back . The result was a collection of effortless silhouettes featuring billowing Kimonos, lose suit pants and forgiving waistcoats. The models floated down the catwalk with perfect ease as Alice presented something that is rarely seen on the catwalk but always well received, flat shoes. The line saw a plethora of lose fitting fabrics that Alice hopes will transfer from day to night . As well as her bold new colour scheme Alice presented her typical wash of summer pastels . The lace up plimsolls decorated with this season's key prints from the collection gave the collection a younger a more relaxed feel and made the collection even more appealing as the models seemed more relaxed than ever. The bold colour palette featuring tomato oranges and sky blues was inspired by Japanese Shunga Ink paintings which showed in the boxy silk jackets lose fitting jackets. Embroided coral and graphic rope design gave the collection a mermaid vibe . The use of flat shoes on the runway gave the models effortlessly relaxed walks . The line also saw a nod to Alice's more traditional colour combination of pastel pinks and baby blues adding the Temperley's typical feminine charm. The evening wear took on a mermaid like feel with fishnet and graphic rope and encrusted with crystal sea creatures. Alice believes her latest collection combines the brand's signature style with a modernist twist. '(It is) a collection that is wearable with a strong contemporary edge.' This collection will see Temperley's diffusion line, Alice by Temperley combined with the collection . Nicole Scherzinger made an appearance on the front row in thigh high black boots . Other distinguished guests included Amber Le Bon (left) and Anna Friel (right) Pixie Lott made an appearance in a monochrome grey ensemble paired with metallic golden heels . Alice Temperley bought her son out with her to thank the crowd . A collection that was inspired by the radiant colours of Japanese artwork would surely call for equally bold shades of makeup. Well at least that would be the obvious option. However, Lisa Eldridge make-up artist to the stars says that the relaxed line needed to be met with equally relaxed beauty. 'The collection features lots of flat tennis shoes' says the 39-year-old beautician 'We wanted the make-up to compliment that. Pared down beauty was the make-up look for Temperley SS15 . 'It would make no sense to have the girls walk down the runway in red lips and heavy make up.' The result is bare faced beauty that is actually extremely achievable and requires most attention on building up a healthy complexion. 'The beauty is very much skin based' says Lisa, adding 'We wanted to create sport glossy skin that looks effortless.' To create the look Lisa Eldridge used nothing more than tinted moisturiser and super balm . When describing how to get the look Lisa explains that using a balm can help achieve the glossy look the girls had on the runway. 'We have just used tinted moisturiser and a super balm on the lips eyelids and eye brows.' The eyebrows continued the trend for bigger is better with Lisa brushing them up to create more volume. Other than a high lighting pencil and a eyelash curlers that was the extent of the makeup for Temperley and yet the models appeared glowing. 'It's fresh and sporty and has a strong natural feel' added Lisa. So we can all breath a sigh relief in the knowledge that the no make-up look is hot this season. Lisa Eldridge (left) gives a model a fresh faced beauty look for the Temperley show . You might not know her name now but you will soon. Ashley William's SS15 collection made a rip roaring debut in the Topshop show space yesterday. The hotly anticipated collection comes from the British based designer who was previously a member of Fashion East. Her SS15 inspiration comes from  reworking references from throughout the 20th Century and combining them seamlessly into modern fabrics and silhouettes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ashley Williams displayed Coca-cola motifs for her SS15 collection to represent breaking down the barriers between East and West . This season Ashley has focused particularly on the sixties and the Age of Aquarius as Western influences flowed into Asia. The collection features motifs of Coca-cola as a way of demonstrating the unification of east and west as Coca-cola is an internationally known brand. Nostalgic silhouettes and shapes from the past become bound by restyled Asian braiding in rubber, based on traditional handmade silk fastenings, and the duality of East and West are drawn together in playful, girly multi-layered tea dresses with oversized collars. The beauty looks at the show had an oriental influence . The SS15 show saw a star studded front row including (from left to right) Laura Bailey Alexa Chung, Daisy Lowe, Pixie Geldof and Thomas Cohen . Jacquard knits, bra-lets and oversized retro graphic prints flirt with social stereotypes of the day. Asian elephants and rainforest monkey signature bags are complemented with fancy appliqué leather handbags. As well as her debut solo collection Ashley has had an extremely busy season. Tipped to be the next big thing the much sought after designer has also worked on several collaborations this season. Ashley also worked alongside LG to produce a garment care bag . The up and coming design was invited to work with LG electronics to design a garment carrier following the news that British adults ruin nine items of clothing in just 12 months. With the launch of the bespoke Ashley Williams for LG Garment Carrier that will be available to buy in September, LG hopes to encourage Brits to take more consideration when caring for their couture and promote the value of investing in and maintaining a future-proof wardrobe, over the trend for throw-away fashion. As well as working with LG Ashley Williams has launched her debut footwear line in collaboration with cult British brand Red or Dead marking its return to London Fashion Week after a decade - a five piece capsule range titled Making Movies, featuring monochrome sling back kitten heels and transparent vinyl court shoes set for launch in February 2015.","Alice Temperley created an effortless collection of lose fitting separates .

"It was the alchemical quest that was midwife to the birth of modern science: how to transform common elements into precious gold. Now researchers have found a bacterium that could fit the bill as a modern day philosophers' stone, by turning a toxic chemical compound found in nature into solid, 24-carat gold. A team from Michigan State University discovered that the metal-tolerant bacteria Cupriavidus metallidurans can grow on massive concentrations of gold chloride, which is deadly to other creatures. They found that the tiny bugs can transform the toxic substance to produce gold nuggets. Scroll down for video . Bioreactor: The installation artwork produced by two Michigan State University professors that uses bacteria to produce pure gold . 'Microbial alchemy is what we’re doing – transforming gold from something that has no value into a solid, precious metal that’s valuable,' said Kazem Kashefi, assistant professor of microbiology and molecular genetics. He and Adam Brown, associate professor of electronic art and intermedia, found that Cupriavidus metallidurans can grow on massive concentrations of gold chloride – a toxic chemical compound found in nature that is often known as liquid gold. In fact, the professors discovered, the bacteria are at least 25 times stronger than previously reported among scientists. The pair made their findings with a novel art installation dubbed The Great Work of the Metal Lover, which uses a combination of biotechnology, art and alchemy to turn liquid gold into 24-carat gold. The artwork contains a portable laboratory made of 24-carat gold-plated hardware, a glass bioreactor containing the bacteria, a combination that produces gold in front of an audience. Bubbling away: The researchers found the metal-tolerant bacteria Cupriavidus metallidurans can grow on massive concentrations of gold chloride, which is deadly to other creatures, and turn it to pure 24-carat gold . Valuable: Pure gold flecks produced by the art-science experiment . Professors Brown and Kashefi fed the bacteria unprecedented amounts of gold chloride, mimicking the process they believe happens in nature. In about a week, the bacteria metabolised the toxins and produced a gold nugget. The Great Work of the Metal Lover uses a living system as a vehicle for artistic exploration, Professor Brown said. The artwork also includes a series of . images made with a scanning electron microscope. Using ancient gold . illumination techniques, Professor Brown applied 24-carat gold leaf to . regions of the prints where a bacterial gold deposit was identified so . each print contains some of the gold produced in the bioreactor. 'This is neo-alchemy. Every part, . every detail of the project is a cross between modern microbiology and . alchemy,' he said. 'Science tries to explain the phenomenological world. As an artist, I’m trying to create a phenomenon. Art has the ability to . push scientific inquiry.' 'Neo-alchemy': This print of a scanning electron microscope image made as part of the experiment has been illuminated with gold leaf made in the bioreactor . The philosopher's stone is a legendary alchemical substance said to be capable of turning base metals like lead into gold. It was also sometimes believed to be an elixir of life, useful for rejuvenation and possibly for achieving immortality. For many centuries, it was the most sought-after goal in Western alchemy. The philosopher's stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, enlightenment, and heavenly bliss. Efforts to discover the philosopher's stone were known as the Great Work. Many early scientists were obsessed with the discovering the secret. It would be cost prohibitive to reproduce their experiment on a larger scale, he said. But the researchers’ success in creating gold raises questions about greed, economy and environmental impact, focusing on the ethics related to science and the engineering of nature. The Great Work of the Metal Lover was selected for exhibition and received an honorable mention at the world-renowned cyber art competition, Prix Ars Electronica, in Austria, where it’s on display until October 7. Prix Ars Electronica is one of the most important awards for creativity and pioneering spirit in the field of digital and hybrid media. 'Art has the ability to probe and question the impact of science in the world, and The Great Work of the Metal Lover speaks directly to the scientific preoccupation while trying to shape and bend biology to our will within the postbiological age,' Professor Brown said.",Professors describe their work as 'neo-alchemy' and exhibit findings in the form of art-science installation now on display in Austria .
"A young man who gave up his job to pursue his passion of BASE jumping has died after what appears to be a botched jump in Glacier National Park. Beau Weiher, of Missoula, Montana, fell to his death on Saturday after heading out to do a solo jump on the summit of Mount Siyeh. His body was discovered by authorities on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Beau Weiher (above) died while out BASE jumping at Glacier National Park in Montana . Extreme passion: Weiher (on bottom) had quit his job as a carpenter to focus on his passion of BASE jumping full time . 'We don’t know whether he had attempted the jump at the time of his fall, or not, but he was attached to his parachute when the body was recovered,' said Glacier Park spokeswoman Denise Germann. Weiher, 22,  quit his job as a carpenter in early 2013 to spend his time BASE jumping, getting by on his very limited savings. 'In order to accomplish my goals, I eliminate any expenses that do not contribute to my plan. Since my last video, I have sold my truck and stopped paying for fuel and insurance,' he said in an interview with The Adrenalist. 'This may seem extreme to most; however, it has allowed me to become the person I want to be.' He added, 'If you can’t make sacrifices for your dreams, you should probably choose bigger dreams.'

"U.S. authorities are tonight moving to extradite Joran van der Sloot to face charges over the Natalee Holloway case after he was jailed for 28 years in Peru for murdering a woman he met at a casino. The 24-year-old Dutch citizen pleaded guilty on Wednesday to killing business student Stephany Flores, 21, in Lima, Peru, in a fit of rage in May 2010, after earlier meeting her in a casino. His sentencing by a Peruvian court on Friday comes as the family of U.S. teenager Miss Holloway seek to have him prosecuted in America over her disappearance seven years ago. Speaking out: Van der Sloot said in jailhouse letters that he hopes the Flores family can forgive him and blames 'bad legal advice' for his lengthy sentence . The court also ordered Van der Sloot to pay $75,000 in reparations to the family of Stephany Flores . Now the legal process is Peru has . finished for the moment, Van der Sloot is expected to be extradited to . the U.S. within a few months over claims he extorted $25,000 from Miss . Holloway's grieving mother. Parents of both women hope his next . stop will be Alabama, where he faces charges of . extorting the cash from Beth Holloway to reveal where her . daughter's body was - which he allegedly never did. On Friday the Peruvian court also ordered him to pay $75,000 in reparations to Miss Flores's family. He can still appeal the . conviction and sentence - his first ever, despite prosecutor claims that . he was involved in Miss Holloway's apparent death on the Dutch . Caribbean island of Aruba. Under Peru's penal system, Van der . Sloot could become eligible for parole after serving half of the . sentence with good behaviour, including work and study. The prosecution had sought a 30-year . sentence for first-degree murder and theft, so the court’s decision . represents what is close to the perfect outcome for them. A tale of two women: Stephany Flores, left, was murdered in a hotel . room five years after Natalee Holloway, right, went missing in . Aruba. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in the Holloway case, but never . charged . Poker: Van der Sloot (top 2nd right) and Stephany Flores (right) playing at a casino before her murder in 2010 . Van der Sloot's lawyer argued that his . client killed Miss Flores two years ago during a fit of rage he blamed . on psychological trauma from being hounded as the prime suspect in the . Holloway case. 'A jail isn't a five-star hotel. Let's hope the authorities take that into account and not just in our case' Ricardo Flores, Stephany's father . The victim's father, Ricardo Flores, . complained after the verdict that Van der Sloot was enjoying favourable . conditions in a Lima prison. Mr Flores said the criminal has been . living apart from the general population and added foreigners with money . can buy superior treatment. ‘A jail isn't a five-star hotel,’ he said. ‘Let's hope the authorities take that into account and not . just in our case.’ Taken away: Van der Sloot, centre, is seen escorted by police officers in Lima in this photo from June 2010, after his arrest for the murder of Stephany Flores . Mr Flores added that he has been . complaining about the excessive privileges that Van der Sloot allegedly . enjoyed in jail. He said he would present evidence of this at a news . conference on Monday. Unconfirmed news reports denied by penal authorities say Van der Sloot has also had a television and video gaming console. The Holloway case remains open and a . judge on Thursday declared her dead. Her parents want Van der Sloot to . eventually be extradited to the U.S. and tried on related charges. He has been indicted in extortion . charges there for allegedly offering to lead a lawyer for Miss . Holloway's mother to her daughter's remains. Before and after: Van der Sloot is seen left in a mugshot from 2010 and right at in a Peru court on Wednesday . Van der Sloot long ago confessed the . Flores killing, telling police he got enraged after the student found . his connection to the Holloway disappearance on his laptop while they . played poker online. Police forensic experts disputed that . version, and the victim's family said Van der Sloot killed Miss Flores . in order to rob her. The prosecution said Van der Sloot . killed her with ‘ferocity’ and ‘cruelty,’ concealing the crime and . fleeing to Chile, where he was caught two days after Miss Flores' decaying body was found. He took more than $200 in cash plus . credit cards from the victim and made his initial getaway in her car, . leaving it in a different part of Lima, prosecutors say. Dad: Ricardo Flores, whose daughter Stephany Flores was murdered by Dutch citizen Joran Van der Sloot, enters the courtroom to hear the reading of the sentence for Van der Sloot on Friday . Other parents: David Holloway, left, is seen during a hearing in Birmingham, Alabama, on Thursday, while Beth Holloway, right, is pursued by reporters after the hearing which declared their daughter is legally dead . ‘We've been dealing with her death for . the last six and a half years,’ Dave Holloway said after the court . hearing regarding his own daughter’s disappearance in Birmingham, . Alabama, on Thursday. 'We've been dealing with her death for the last six and a half years. We've still got a long way to go to get justice' Dave Holloway, Natalee's father . He said the judge's order in Alabama . on his daughter's death closes one chapter in the ordeal, but added: . ‘We've still got a long way to go to get justice. 'Everybody knows his personality,' he said of Van der Sloot. 'He is beyond rehabilitation.' Miss Flores was slain five years to . the day after Miss Holloway, an 18-year-old from the wealthy Birmingham . suburb of Mountain Brook, disappeared. Van der Sloot now faces charges in Alabama accusing him of . extorting $25,000 from Beth Holloway to reveal the location of her . daughter's body. Prosecutors said the money was paid, but . nothing was disclosed about the woman's whereabouts. Authorities said . they believe the tall Dutchman used the money to travel to Peru on May . 14, 2010. Dead: Stephany Flores, a Peruvian, poses at the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu in Cuzco. She was killed in 2010 . Demonstration: A man holds posters of Joran Van der Sloot, left, and Peruvian girl Stephany Flores outside the Lurigancho prison where Van der Sloot was being read his sentence for murdering the woman . Natalee Holloway disappeared on May 30, 2005, during a high school graduation trip to Aruba, where Van der Sloot grew up. Her body was never found and repeated searches turned up nothing as intense media coverage brought the case worldwide attention. Investigators have long worked from . the assumption that the young woman was dead in Aruba, where the case . was classified as a homicide investigation. That investigation remains open, . though there has been no recent activity, said Solicitor General Taco . Stein, an official with the prosecutor's office in Aruba. In Birmingham, Natalee Holloway's . parents, who have been divorced since 1993, shook hands and talked . briefly before the hearing.

"Sam Allardyce has issued a withering riposte to Mauro Zarate after the West Ham United striker accused his manager of disrespecting him. The Argentine, 27, has been allowed to join Queens Park Rangers on loan for the rest of the season, even though top scorer Diafra Sakho will be spending January at the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal. Zarate claimed Allardyce froze him out, adding: ‘He has made it difficult for me ever since I arrived.’ West Ham boss Sam Allardyce says Mauro Zarate is having a medical at QPR ahead of a loan move . The Argentine was the first of nine signings made by West Ham in the summer but hasn't nailed down a spot . Co-owner David Sullivan sanctioned the three-year deal for Zarate in the close season. Allardyce argued that the only reason Zarate’s time on the pitch had been limited was because he had not been good enough to displace Sakho, Ecuador star Enner Valencia or England’s Andy Carroll. ‘Clearly he’s a lad who is very frustrated at not being picked but all of what he is saying is not true,’ Allardyce said. ‘He wasn’t playing because he wasn’t good enough. Not good enough is a bit harsh because he is talented and he’s contributed well. But he’s not good enough to play as regularly as he wants compared to the others. It’s as simple as that. Zarate says he's out of favour with Sam Allardyce because he was brought in by co-chairman David Sullivan . Zarate has also been the victim of the excellent form of fellow new signings such as Enner Valencia . ‘When you look at Valencia, Sakho and Andy Carroll and what they have achieved and what Mauro has achieved when he’s played, when we look at what he has contributed all round, and you have got that array of talent to choose from, then somebody’s going to be not happy. ‘Then you’ve got Carlton Cole sitting on the bench not coming on. He’s had more of a chance than Carlton Cole, who is one of my favourites. I love him. He’s a fantastic pro and a great guy, so it has nothing to do with a personal point of view.’ Allardyce was also bemused to be named by Jose Mourinho as one of the rival coaches the Chelsea boss believes is part of a ‘campaign’ to brand his players as divers. Diafra Sakho (left) also got off to a flyer with eight goals in 10 games but hasn't scored in the last four . Mourinho aired his theory after Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Southampton, where Cesc Fabregas was booked for a tumble in the penalty area. Allardyce had been critical of Branislav Ivanovic, who was not booked for what looked like a dive in Chelsea’s 2-0 win over West Ham two days earlier. ‘What’s he on about?’ Allardyce said of Mourinho’s claims. Allardyce has rejected Jose Mourinho's claims that he has a 'campaign' against Chelsea .","Mauro Zarate has moved on loan to Queens Park Rangers .

"Bill Clinton's consulting physician has revealed the touching reason the ex-president went vegan - so he could walk Chelsea down the aisle and see his 'grandkids born and grow up.' He adopted a 'plant-based' diet about five or six years ago, according to Dr. Dean Ornish, a physician consultant to Bill Clinton and an adviser to Hillary Clinton for more than 20 years. Reflecting on his impetus for changing his diet, Ornish recalled the former president saying he wanted to live longer. Scroll down for video . Healthy choices: Bill Clinton's former doctor has revealed the touching reason the ex-president went vegan - so he could walk Chelsea down the aisle and see his 'grandkids born and grow up' 'I asked him why... and he said, ""I want to live long enough to walk my daughter down the aisle and to see my grandkids born and grow up,""' the consulting physician told the Huffington Post. In 1993, Ornish said Hillary Clinton asked him to train the chefs at The White House, Camp David, and Air Force One to cook more healthfully for the first family. He told the news website that he told the president 'It's not all in your genes.' 'Your genes are not your fate... if you change your lifestyle, you change your genes,' he recalled saying. Ornish went on to explain the futility of genes 'not to blame, but to empower, because if it's all in your genes, there's nothing you can do about it, and [Bill Clinton]'s one of the most powerful people on the planet.' He said since Clinton started eating mainly fruits and vegetables, he's been 'doing great.' In an August AARP The Magazine article, Clinton talked about how he lost 30lbs before Chelsea's wedding in July 2010. Living longer: Clinton adopted a 'plant-based' diet about five or six years ago, according to Dr. Dean Ornish, pictured, a physician consultant to Bill and an adviser to Hillary for more than 20 years . 'I've stopped eating meat, cheese, milk, even fish,' he said at the time. 'No dairy at all.' In the article, he said: 'I just decided that I was the high-risk person, and I didn't want to fool with this anymore. And I wanted to live to be a grandfather. So I decided to pick the diet that I thought would maximize my chances of long term survival.' He said more than giving up meat and chicken, the hardest part was saying no to dairy. 'The main thing that was hard for me actually... was giving up yogurt and hard cheese,' he told the magazine. 'I love that stuff, but it really made a big difference when iI did it.' Hillary Clinton is also eating healthier since she stopped traveling so much after stepping down as Secretary of State. Thanks to their new virtuous lifestyles, the pair will be fighting fit grandparents to Chelsea's first born, due later this year.","The former president adopted a 'plant-based' diet about five or six years ago and hasn't looked back .

"Millions of children are enjoying a 'bonus birthday' each year - because their parents don't want them to feel left out on a sibling's big day. Researchers found almost half of children are having two or more 'birthdays' a year because parents buy them presents on their sibling's birthdays, as well as their own. On top of that, instead of saving all the presents for the birthday boy or girl, grandparents and even family friends are getting in on the act and buying gifts for each child on family birthdays. Gifts galore! New research reveals that 45 per cent of British children get presents on their siblings' birthdays . Not wanting the others to feel left out was the main reason for buying presents for everyone, as well believing it's not fair if their children to have to sit and watch while their sibling gets to open everything. But the gesture has backfired for some, with a fifth admitting their children now expect to receive a gift on every single birthday a brother or sister celebrates. A spokesman for surveys site OnePoll.com, which carried out the research, said: 'It is astonishing to think that parents of today are more willing to spend extra money on children who aren't even celebrating a birthday, than teach them that on one day of the year it isn't all about them. 'We know that the majority of mums and dads will simply think they are being kind and thoughtful, but the fact is that children need to learn how important it is to think of other's before themselves. 'And if that means allowing their brother or sister the limelight for one day of the year, then so be it. Party time: Parents also revealed that parties are planned to allow for the tastes of their other children . Sharing: Some children are even made to share their birthday gifts with their siblings so no-one feels left out . 'Modern children should be taught not to expect presents all the time, and should be able to sit nicely and enjoy the fact their sibling is so happy on their special day.' The study of 2,000 parents found that 45 per cent of buy their children birthday presents on their siblings' birthdays, as well as their actual birthday. And half of those admitted they can't bear the thought of one of their children feeling left out while their other child enjoys the birthday limelight. Another one in three think it's unfair to make the others sit and watch as one gets all the presents, while one in five said their children started to asked why they don't get presents as well. But 28 per cent admitted that they simply did it as a treat once and now feel they have to carry it on to save disappointment. The study also found that 27 per cent of children will also receive gifts from their grandparents on a siblings' birthday, while a further fifth are lucky enough to receive them from family friends as well. Pressure: Parents are worried other children will be upset if not allowed a share of the birthday limelight . Because of the bonus birthday presents seven in ten children now look forward to their sibling's birthday, while a fifth have been known to ask for presents in the lead up to the event. And eight in 10 parents say they will continue to treat their children on their sibling's birthday until they are old enough to understand that the day is not about them. But 45 per cent believe it is too hard for their little ones to understand they will receive less attention than usual. The researchers found that as well as getting 'bonus birthdays', a third of children are also being allowed to help their brother and sister with opening their presents. And when the birthday child has a party to celebrate, six in 10 parents will always make sure the event is appropriate for older and younger siblings to attend too. In the event of a party, 38 per cent of parents invite friends for their other children, while 45 per cent make their other children a special party bag so they feel included. The OnePoll.com spokesman added: 'At the end of the day, parents only want to treat their children equally, and as long as the children aren't spoiled for the rest of the year, what's the harm in a present or two on a sibling's birthday. 'It just shows how kind and loving our respondents are, as they just want to keep the whole family happy and contented.'","45 per cent of British parents give their children 'bonus birthdays'

"A teenage girl who was almost struck by an oncoming subway train has been reunited with the hero who rescued her by pulling her from the tracks moments before the impending collision. Josh Garcia, a New York University food service employee and father-of-three, bravely jumped onto the Union Square station tracks back in May after Stephanie Xue, a Bronx high school senior, fell off the platform. And last weekend, the 16-year-old got to say thanks to the good Samaritan, and there were hugs and tears all around. Thank you: Stephanie Xue, pictured left and right, handed her good Samaritan a bunch of flowers when they met again last weekend . Hero dad: Father of three Joshua Garcia saved the life of a young girl who fainted onto New York subway tracks and last weekend they were reunited . 'They just kept saying, ""Thank you, thank you,""' Garcia said of Xue and her parents in an interview with DNAInfo. Last week, Xue's mother contacted Garcia and invited him to lunch so their family could show their appreciation. Garcia told the news website that the teen's mother nearly broke down, telling him: 'If it were not for you, this could have been horrible.' But the humble hero told the woman, 'The only thing that is important is Stephanie is alive and well, and we should just be thankful for that.' Garcia noticed Xue become dizzy at around 6.45 p.m. on May 7 on the northbound Lexington Avenue line platform and then plunge headfirst onto the tracks. She hit her head so hard on a rail the noise sounded like a gunshot, he told DNAInfo. Hundreds of commuters looked on but did nothing to help the wounded teen, but Garcia didn't hesitate. He pushed through the crowd and jumped down onto the tracks as bright lights emerged from the tunnel signalling an arriving train. Brave: Garcia, pictured, didn't hesitate to jump onto the tracks to save Stephanie Xue while other commuters just watched . But Garcia acted quickly, scooping up the 5-feet-4 inch Xue and putting her on the platform before hoisting himself to safety. He . stayed with the teen, and was helped by Justine Omilig, a 23-year-old . nursing student, until paramedics arrived and rushed her to Bellevue . Hospital. Two months later, Xue is still recovering from the 6-inch-deep head injury she suffered in the fall, though she's doing well. Describing the incident at the time, Garcia said: 'She was . leaning over the platform like she was woozy from medication, and then I . saw her fall and I was like, ""Oh s**t!.""' Although . he was about 50 feet from Xue, Garcia pushed through the apathetic . crowd and without hesitating, jumped onto the tracks to rescue the girl, . whose body was lying diagonally across the tracks. Garcia hoisted the petite five-foot four-inch teen above his head. 'You could see her skull,' Garcia told DNA Info of her wound. 'It was terrifying to look at.' Even more upsetting, Garcia said, were the reactions of his fellow commuters. Crowded platform: Out of hundreds waiting at Union Square for the uptown subway, Garcia and Omilig were the only people to help Xue (stock photo) As he attempted to deposit Xue safely . on the platform, he looked up to see that most people on the platform . were either taking videos or pictures of the incident with their cell . phones. 'It was amazing seeing all these people doing nothing,' he said. 'It was an eye-opener.' Thankfully, Omilig ran over and helped stem the bleed from Xue's head would with a wad of tissues. Together, Garcia and Omilig kept the terrified teenager conscious and talking until an ambulance arrived. Doctors at Bellevue Hospital needed 50 stitches to close the gash on Xue's head. She can't remember much about the ordeal. 'I remember I started to feel dizzy and I just blacked out, and then I woke up and Joshua was helping support my neck and this woman was applying pressure to my wound,' Xue told DNA Info back in May. She said she was deeply grateful to Garcia for his actions that day when she was in need. 'There is a lot I want to say, but it is hard to find the words,' Xue said. 'I am just so thankful he was there to help me.' For his part, Garcia refused to acknowledge there was anything heroic about his rescue. 'I give all the glory to Lord Jesus,' Garcia told DNA Info. 'I was glad to help and to show her that there are good people out there.'","Stephanie Xue, 16, fainted onto New York subway tracks at Union Square during rush hour on May 7 .

"An Afghan police officer shot and killed three U.S. Marines after sharing a meal with them before dawn Friday and then fled into the desolate darkness of southern Afghanistan, the third attack on coalition forces by their Afghan counterparts in a week. The Afghan police commander opened fire on the three Americans after inviting them to dinner at his outpost under the pretext of having a meeting to discuss security. Thirty-one coalition service members have now died this year at the hands of Afghan forces or insurgents disguised in Afghan uniforms, according to NATO — a dramatic rise from previous years. The assaults have cast a shadow of fear and mistrust over U.S. efforts to train Afghan soldiers and police more than 10 years after the U.S.-led invasion to topple the Taliban's hardline Islamist regime for sheltering al-Qaida's leadership. Scroll down for video . Working together: NATO troops are training and working alongside Afghan soldiers as they take increasing responsibility for the anti-insurgency campaign. Afghanistan's National Army (ANA) soldiers march during a graduation ceremony at a training center in Herat on August 9, 2012. The attack which killed three soldiers this morning is the latest in a series of so-called green-on-blue attacks in Afghanistan. The Afghan soldiers in the picture are not related to the incident . The attacks also raise further doubts . about the quality of the Afghan forces taking over in many areas before . most international troops leave the country in 2014. Friday's deadly shooting - in which another service member was injured - took place in the volatile Sangin district of Helmand province. Sangin was a Taliban stronghold for years and has one of the highest concentrations of improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, in the country. Sangin's district chief and the Taliban both identified the gunman as Asadullah, a member of the Afghan National Police who was helping the Marines train the Afghan Local Police. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi said by telephone that the attacker joined the insurgency after the shooting. 'Now, he is with us,' Ahmadi said. The district chief, Mohammad Sharif, said the shooting happened at a police checkpoint after a joint meal and a security meeting. The meal took place before dawn because of Ramadan, the month in which Muslims abstain from food during daylight hours. Also at the dinner were recruits to the Afghan . Local Police, a village militia being trained by American special . forces, according to an Afghan official. 'It looks like he had drawn up a plan to kill them previously,' an Afghan official said of the lone shooter. It is not clear if he was wearing military or police uniform during the attack. The attack is the third killing this week of coalition soldiers by Afghans they are training to take over responsibility for security once most international forces leave in 2014. The recent spate of deadly attacks will undoubtedly also cause a headache for Barack Obama in the run-up to November's presidential election. Members of the Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers stand guard in Laghman province as NATO troops train them in preparation for their withdrawal in 2014 . Last year, a U.S. Army team led by a behavioral scientist produced a 70-page survey that revealed both Afghan and American soldiers hold disturbingly negative perceptions of the other. According to the survey, many Afghan security personnel found U.S. troops 'extremely arrogant, bullying and unwilling to listen to their advice' and sometimes lacking concern about Afghans' safety in combat. They accused the Americans of ignoring female privacy and using denigrating names for Afghans. American troops, in turn, often accused Afghan troops and police of 'pervasive illicit drug use, massive thievery, personal instability, dishonesty, no integrity,' the survey, which has been downplayed by U.S. military officials, said. The U.S. hopes the Afghan Local Police, a village defense force backed by the national government, will become a key force in fighting the insurgency. Just last month, a coalition statement touted the Marines' work training the Afghan Local Police in Sangin, describing a new academy in an Afghan National Police compound near a Marines base. 'During the three-week course, future police train in the basics of patrolling, vehicle and personnel searches, checkpoints, escalation of force, detainee procedures, marksmanship and Afghan law,' the statement said. 'After completing training, the new ALP are stationed at patrol bases in their hometowns.' Meanwhile Friday, Britain said one of its soldiers died the previous day . from wounds he received in a shooting while on patrol in the Nad Ali . district of Helmand province. The death brings to 19 the number of coalition troops killed in Afghanistan this month. And elsewhere in Helmand province Friday, six Afghan civilians were killed when their car hit a roadside bomb, one of thousands planted by insurgents across the volatile region. Helmand police official Mohammad Ismail Khan said the bomb killed three children, two women and a man. Last night's attack came at the end of a week of violence; on Tuesday, two gunmen wearing Afghan army uniforms killed a U.S. soldier and wounded two others in Paktia province in the east. The Taliban took responsibility for the attack. The gunmen escaped after the shooting and a search is underway to track them down. Victims: Thomas E. Kennedy, 35, left, and Sgt. Maj. Kevin Griffin, 45, were killed in a twin suicide attack in the Kunar province on Wednesday. The troops were assigned to units based at Fort Carson in Colorado . Killed: Walter D. Gray died in Wednesday's suicide bombing attack . On Wednesday, suicide bombers killed three members of a Nato patrol and an American working for the State Department's ASAID programme in eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the bombing which happened in Kunar province, an eastern stronghold of the insurgency that lies along the volatile border with Pakistan where militants have hideouts. Two attackers wearing suicide vests detonated their explosives as a Nato foot patrol passed by the headquarters of the provincial government. The U.S. government identified the four Americans killed earlier in the week. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's statement said USAID foreign service officer Ragaei Abdelfattah, three coalition service members and an Afghan civilian were killed. A State Department diplomat was injured. The Defense Department identified the three troops killed in Kunar as Air Force Maj. Walter D. Gray, of Conyers, Ga.; Army Maj. Thomas E. Kennedy, of West Point, N.Y.; and Command Sgt. Maj. Kevin J. Griffin, of Laramie, Wyo. And on Thursday, two Afghan soldiers tried to gun down a group of NATO troops outside a military base in eastern Afghanistan. No international forces were killed, but one of the attackers was killed as NATO forces shot back. This year has seen a rising number of so-called 'green-on-blue' attacks in which Afghan security forces, or insurgents disguised in their uniforms, kill their U.S. or NATO partners. So far this year, 30 coalition troops have been killed in 20 such attacks. That compares with 11 fatal attacks and 20 deaths the previous year. In 2007 and 2008 there was a combined total of four attacks and four deaths. The worrying rise in 'green-on-blue' attacks raises questions over the merit of U.S. troops training Afghan police and soldiers in order to hand over security responsibilities come 2014. This mentoring means Western troops living and working in very close quarters with their Afghan counterparts. Both coalition and Afghan officials say that the majority of the attacks are because of personal antagonism between the counterparts rather than being the result of Taliban infiltration. Deadly week: On Tuesday two gunman wearing Afghan army uniforms killed a U.S. soldier in the Paktia province. Four Americans died on Wednesday in a suicide bombing attack in the Kunar province . Brig. Gen. Gunter Katz described Friday’s attack as ‘tragic’ but told CBS is did not reflect the ‘security situation’ calling the shooting an ‘isolated incident.’ This week in Afghanistan has been particularly violent  with eight Americans, including one civilian, killed in three separate attacks. On Tuesday, two gunmen wearing Afghan army uniforms killed a U.S. soldier and wounded two others in Paktia province in the east. Suicide bombers killed three members of a Nato patrol and an American working for the State Department's ASAID programme in the Kunar province in eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday. On Thursday two Afghan soldiers tried to gun down a group of NATO troops outside a military base in eastern Afghanistan.One of the attackers was killed as NATO forces shot back. Friday morning in Helmand province, an Afghan police commander lured three U.S. special forces to their death by inviting them to dinner. He then opened fire killing three and injuring one. The Taliban say the shooter fled and joined their forces. In another incident, NATO said a coalition service member died after an insurgent attack in southern Afghanistan. The death brings to 19 the number of coalition troops killed in Afghanistan this month.Also in Helmand province Friday, six Afghan civilians were killed when their car hit a roadside bomb. 'We're confident this won't stop operations,' the ISAF spokesman told CBS. 'We trust our Afghan partners. But we're looking at how to mitigate incidents.' Katz detailed the Afghan security forces extensive vetting process which involves recruits getting two character references from local elders, as well as biometric, medical and drug tests. Nonetheless, with the increase of ‘green-on-blue’ attacks destroying trust between the coalition and Afghan troops, U.S. units now select a ‘guardian angel’ to watch over fellow troops - including when they sleep - at the joint bases. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the Taliban released a sickening video showing an Afghan soldier who killed a U.S. soldier and injured two others being welcomed back into the insurgent encampment. On May 11 the soldier – who the Taliban named as Mamood – turned on his American trainers and opened fire. First Lt Alejo Thompson, a father of two young children, was killed in the ambush in eastern Afghanistan. The disturbing video shows the soldier being hailed as a hero. Elders embrace him and adorn him with necklaces strung with flowers. They congratulate him on his deed as he smiles for the camera. VIDEO: NATO Spokesman discusses the killings...

"After a summer of discontent that saw hundreds of rioters roam the streets of the capital, the Metropolitan Police needed to take action. And it appears that this imposing 10foot high steel structure is their answer to the problem. The police cordon was erected at the north end of Whitehall near Trafalgar Square yesterday afternoon in an attempt to stop anti-cuts protesters heading towards Parliament. Officers were also called in to help out paramedics after thousands of NHS workers went on strike. Imposing: The steel cordon stretches across the road in central London today as police unveil their latest tactic in the bid to stop disorder on the streets . Sealed off: The barrier was erected at the north end of Whitehall. It is used by police when they think a public order situation is developing to block people and cars . On the lookout: Police officers look through the windows of the cordon that has been erected just yards from Trafalgar Square and Nelson's Column to stop protesters heading towards Parliament . Officials said 42 per cent of London . Ambulance Service workers walked out on strike - and the service . received 30 per cent more calls than normal. The reason for the surge is . unclear. Police did not deal with 'critical incidents' where lives were at risk - but provided medical support where they could help out. The Metropolitan Police said the barrier of steel . structure is put in place when a potential public order situation is . likely to develop and they need a physical barrier to block cars and . people. Yesterday officers stood behind the cordon . using windows to lookout for troublemakers who had used today's public . sector strikes as an excuse to protest. The barrier was used after a group of protestors stormed Panton House in Leicester Square, with some making it on to the roof and setting off flares. The group from Occupy London - the anti-capitalist protesters camped out . in the churchyard of St Paul's Cathedral - said they were 'targeting' Mick Davis, the CEO of mining company Xstrata. They began to unfurl a banner saying 'Power to the . . .' but were stopped before the building could be occupied. An Occupy London spokesman said they . were aiming the demonstration at Mr Davis because he was the highest . paid CEO of all the FTSE 100 companies in the last year. Some protesters close to Panton House lit flares during the protest, such as this man who walks down the centre of Haymarket in central London . Heavy presence: A large number of police officers formed a cordon outside the offices of mining company Xstrata . He said that around 20 protesters were being held inside by riot police . and that a 'few hundred' were being kettled in the street outside - a . number of them were holding UK Uncut placards. Karen Lincoln, supporter of Occupy London, said: 'Mick Davis is a prime . example of the greedy 1 per cent lining their own pockets while denying workers' pensions.' An Xstrata spokeswoman said: 'Xstrata confirms that a number of protesters have attempted to enter the company's offices in central London today. 'All executive pay is approved by the company's shareholders and is linked to company and individual performance. Earlier in . Hackney officers and a dog unit kettled campaigners, who were gathered . outside a library in Dalston Lane, Dalston. Police made 37 arrests. Witnesses . said the protest, which began around 9am, started out peacefully but . erupted into violence after police surrounded the group when they . started playing music on a sound system. One bystander said police started arresting people after two protesters attacked a PCSO. A small number of protesters from UK Uncut targeted an office block in London's Haymarket, gaining access to the roof . Police made several arrests after the building was stormed by around 20 protesters . Protest sign: The demonstrators displayed this banner from the roof the building but it was quickly removed by police officers who had stormed the building . 'It . was carnage,' he added. 'It all kicked off when two people attacked a . PCSO.  'Then the police detained people. I think they were just worried . about it escalating because they were very pleasant with the way they . dealt with people. 'There . had been rumours that there was going to be a couple of thousand . protesters coming down here which I think is why there were so many . police stationed here. 'Eventually they packed the protesters on a coach and took them away.' Witnesses said the police had maintained a distance from the protest . until they began blocking the road, when officers intervened. Tony . Aydan, who runs a dry cleaners across the road, said: 'The protest . started out peacefully and there were women and children there. 'At one point they were blocking the road so the police moved them back. Going in: Police rush the building used by mining company Xstrata, after protestors from Occupy London entered the building . Apprehended: A group of police officers search a . man near Trafalgar Square while another close to the famous landmark . makes his feelings known . 'Then there were people turning up who looked like they didn't belong there. They were covering up their faces and looked like they wanted trouble. 'Something must have happened because the police contained them at the side of the road and just started arresting people. 'If they had moved along it wouldn't have happened but I saw one woman pushing police officers. Any excuse to have a go.' Kollin Bagura, who runs To the Jungle cafe, in Dalston Lane, said the police jumped on a group of protesters who had begun pushing and shoving. 'It seemed quite heavy handed but it contained them well,' he added. 'People were upset because they didn't think they had done anything wrong, but it did stop things escalating.' Meanwhile another witness questioned the need to arrest protesters, labelling the move 'heavy-handed.' 'The only considerable breach of the peace was playing music on a sound system. Is that is a criminal activity?' he said.","Police called in to help ambulance service in London as thousands of NHS workers go on strike .

"Three Islamic fanatics discussed a bizarre plot to kill people with a giant blade attached to a monster truck dubbed the ‘Ultimate Mowing Machine’, a court was told. The conversation was recorded on a bug planted by MI5, who suspected they were preparing to kill themselves in a suicide bombing plot. Irfan Naseer, 31, Irfan Khalid, 27, and Ashik Ali, 27, are accused of plotting an attack that would wreak more carnage that the atrocities of July 7, 2005. Irfan Naseer, 31, of Sparkhill, Birmingham . Irfan Khalid, 27, of Sparkbrook, Birmingham . Ashik Ali, 27, of Balsall Heath, Birmingham . The Birmingham-based trio were caught on tape considering a terrorist attack which features in a banned Al Qaeda internet propaganda magazine called Inspire. In the tape recordings of bugged conversations alleged gang leader Irfan Naseer, 31, is heard saying: 'I feel like I've been driving a monster truck, you know.' His alleged accomplice, Irfan Khalid, 27, replies: 'Yeah, put blades on the front and trample on everyone.' Khalid tells co-defendants Naseer and Ashik Ali that if they did that they would not get shot for a long time, the court heard. Asked why, Khalid said: 'You know what they said, the brothers in the magazine, they said stick thingy on... at the front, like you know, erm, blade... just weld it on and run into people. Just drive into people in a crowded area.' Woolwich Crown Court was told the gang planned to open an Islamic shop as a cover for their terror activities and said they would turn the street into a 'little war-zone'. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: 'Khalid and Naseer talked about people ""getting killed"" in a particular road, and how no-one would come there anymore because it would be a ""little war-zone"". 'They talked about putting blades on a truck and running into people, an idea that had been published in an outlawed extremist online magazine called Inspire, under the title 'The Ultimate Mowing Machine'."" Their plan was to recruit others and raise cash for their plot to stage a terror attack in Britain which would be more devastating than 7/7, the court heard. In the dock: The trio were cautioned about the sky-high interest rates on payday loans, but believed they would never have to make repayments, it is alleged . The three men are on trial at Woolwich Crown Court accused of masterminding a terrorist plot. The trio, from Birmingham, wanted to detonate eight rucksack bombs and timer bombs in crowded areas but police arrested them before they could carry out their ‘bombing campaign,’ a jury has heard. They are part of a gang of 11 men and one woman who were arrested in September last year. On the second day of their trial, prosecutor Brian Altman QC said the mindset of the British-born ‘jihadists’ was clear from as far back as 2006. He told jurors Ashik Ali registered two usernames on eBay using the email address ‘be-terror@yahoo.co.uk.’ 'The first user name he registered with eBay bore the name 'terrorshop' and the second he registered as 'shopterror',' Mr Altman said. 'The first of the accounts was suspended for unknown reasons in October 2006. The second account remains active but, like the first, has never been used. 'However, they reveal his mindset even then, even if the usernames he chose were registered half in jest,' he said. Terror trial: The trial at Woolwich Crown Court (pictured) is expected to last 10 weeks . The court heard his co-defendants twice travelled to Pakistan for terror training in the mountainous regions of Pakistan, which are populated with those closely linked to the Taliban. The first trip in March 2009 lasted eight months. The pair then returned in December 2010 staying for seven months. While there they learned how to use weapons, explosives and even poisons, it is alleged. They funded their trips by posing as bogus charity workers for Muslim Aid and ‘beguiling the public’ by wearing the charity’s green T-shirts and merchandise, Mr Altman said. Out of the £13,500 they fraudulently collected in Birmingham and Leicester only £1,500 was handed to Muslim Aid. But when the group ‘got a little greedy’ and tried to invest some of the money to get greater returns they ended up losing £9,000, it was said. They also discussed mass poisoning along with the suggestion of fixing blades to a vehicle and driving it into crowds, the court heard. Naseer, of Sparkhill, Khalid, of Sparkbrook and Ali, of Balsall Heath, all in Birmingham, deny planning a bombing campaign, recruiting others for the plot and fraudulently collecting money to fund it. Khalid and Naseer also deny travelling to Pakistan for terror training while Naseer further denies assisting others to travel to Pakistan for terror training. The trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks, continues.

It all looked straight forward for PSG after 20 minutes, having taken a 2-0 lead through Lucas Moura and Adrien Rabiot. But their defensive liabilities were yet again exposed by a side fighting relegation from Ligue 1, leaving PSG without a win in three games. Bastia answered with four goals, starting with Ryad Boudebouz's penalty after 32 minutes. That was soon followed by Francois Modesto's equaliser on the stroke of half time to make it 2-2. After the break, it was the Julian Palmieri show. The French attacking midfielder proved the difference, scoring in the 56th and 89th minute to secure the 4-2 win. It means PSG manager Laurent Blanc squandered the opportunity to close the gap on Ligue 1 leaders Marseille. Before the winter break, Blanc lamented his team's lack of aggression and rigor, particularly when defending set pieces - and two of Bastia's goals  came from corners.

"Vice President Joe Biden arrived in the Hamptons today for vacation - his third trip away from home in the last two weeks. President Barack Obama is also on vacation this week at at an elite summer vacation spot: Martha's Vineyard. The first family arrived on Saturday, and the president has spent three out of the last four days on the golf course with friends. Vice President Joe Biden, center, is pictured cruising the Snake River with family and friends on Friday, Aug. 8 near Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The whitewater rafting trip is one of three mini-vacas Biden has been on in the last two weeks . President Barack Obama, right, smiles as he gives a pat on the arm to Cyrus Walker, left, cousin of White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, while golfing at Vineyard Golf Club, in Edgartown, Massachusetts on the island of Martha's Vineyard today . The only day Obama has not golfed on his trip so far was yesterday. The White House says he went to the beach with his family, instead. He also made a brief public statement on the state of affairs in Iraq after talking with the country's president and new prime minister and attended a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraiser. Obama talked to two world leaders today and hit the links again. The president was joined on the golf course by his longtime pal Eric Whitaker, former U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, and Cyrus Walker, White House Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett's cousin. Obama will remain in Martha's Vineyard through the rest of this week. On Sunday he will return to Washington, D.C. for two days for meetings at the White House. Then he'll go back to Martha's Vineyard to finish out his vacation. The first family will return to D.C. for good on Sunday, August 24. Vice President Biden and his wife Jill will remain in the Hamptons - where Bill and Hillary Clinton are also vacationing this month - until next Tuesday, according to a local news report. Little else is known about the Biden's stay in the Hamptons, and the trip is listed as a visit to Long Island, New York, in Biden's public schedule. The Hamptons are located in Long Island. The Bidens just finished . a five-day retreat in Wyoming yesterday. The couple was spotted going whitewater rafting down the Snake River near Jackson Hole with family and friends during the trip. Just two weeks ago the Bidens went on a two-day getaway to Rehoboth Beach in Delaware. During the trips Biden has also continued to hold talks with world leaders, however, and the White House says Biden has spoken over the phone with three Iraqi officials today alone.","Biden arrived in the Hamptons today for a week-long vacation .

"NASA's long-running Voyager 1 spacecraft has entered a new layer of the solar system that scientists hadn't known was there, researchers say. Scientists have dubbed this region the ‘magnetic highway’ and say it's the last stop before interstellar space, or the space between stars. The discovery was announced on Monday at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco, California. The 'magnetic highway': Here the sun's magnetic field lines are connected to interstellar magnetic field lines, allowing particles from inside the heliosphere to zip away and particles from interstellar space to zoom in . 'We do believe this may be the very last layer between us and interstellar space,’ said Edward Stone, Voyager project scientist based at the California Institute of Technology, in Pasadena, California. ‘This region was not anticipated, was not predicted.’ Therefore, it's hard to determine how soon the spacecraft will leave the solar system altogether, Stone said. ‘It may take two months, it may take two years,’ he added. The outer limits: This artist's concept shows NASA's two Voyager spacecraft exploring a turbulent region of space known as the heliosheath, the outer shell of the bubble of charged particles around our Sun . Voyager is bathed in solar wind from the southern hemisphere flowing northward . In a release, Nasa said it was referring to this new region as a magnetic highway for charged particles because our Sun's magnetic field lines are connected there to interstellar magnetic field lines. This connection allows lower-energy charged particles from inside our heliosphere - the bubble of charged particles the Sun blows around itself - to zoom out, and allows higher-energy particles from outside to stream in. Before entering this region, the charged particles bounced around in all directions, as if trapped on local roads inside the heliosphere. It was data taken from Voyager's low-energy charged particle instrument that showed it first entered the magnetic highway region in July. The instrument includes a stepper motor that turns the platform on which the sensors are mounted, so that the field of view rotates through 360 degrees. This motor was tested for 500,000 steps, enough to reach the orbit of Saturn, and has now completed over 6 million steps. The old-fashioned capacitor bank underneath the motor stores energy needed to provide a 15.7-watt pulse every 192 seconds. However, because the direcrtion of the magnetic field lines has remained the same, the Voyager team believe the new region is still inside our solar bubble. They predict the direction of these magnetic field lines will change when the craft breaks out into interstellar space. 'Although Voyager 1 still is inside the sun's environment, we now can taste what it's like on the outside because the particles are zipping in and out on this magnetic highway,' said Dr Stone. 'We believe this is the last leg of our journey to interstellar space. Our best guess is it's likely just a few months to a couple years away. 'The new region isn't what we expected, but we've come to expect the unexpected from Voyager.' Since December 2004, when Voyager 1 crossed a point in space called the termination shock, the spacecraft has been exploring the heliosphere's outer layer, called the heliosheath. In this region, the stream of charged particles from the sun, known as the solar wind, abruptly slowed down from supersonic speeds and became turbulent. Voyager 1's environment was consistent for about five and a half years. The spacecraft then detected that the outward speed of the solar wind slowed to nothing. The intensity of the magnetic field also began to increase at that time. Deep in space: Voyager 1 . Data from two instruments aboard . voyager that measure charged particles showed it first entered the . magnetic highway region on July 28 this year. The . region ebbed away and flowed toward Voyager 1 several times. The . spacecraft entered the region again August 25 and the environment has . been stable since. 'If we . were judging by the charged particle data alone, I would have thought we . were outside the heliosphere,' said Stamatios Krimigis, chief scientist . on the low-energy charged particle instrument. 'But . we need to look at what all the instruments are telling us and only . time will tell whether our interpretations about this frontier are . correct.' Spacecraft data . revealed the magnetic field became stronger each time Voyager entered . the highway region; however, the direction of the magnetic field lines . did not change. NASA's robotic space probes Voyager 1 and 2, both weighing 1,592 lb (722 kg), prepared for launch in 1977 on missions to locate and study the outer Solar System and eventually interstellar space. Voyager 2 launched on August 20, 1977, before Voyager 1. Voyager 1 launched on September 5, 1977 moving faster than its sister probe and eventually passing it. On June 15, 2012, NASA scientists reported that Voyager 1 may be very close to entering interstellar space and becoming the first man-made object to leave the Solar System. Voyager 2 will have to be turned off by 2020. Voyager 1 will have to be turned off by 2025. 'We are in a . magnetic region unlike any we've been in before - about ten times more . intense than before the termination shock - but the magnetic field data . show no indication we're in interstellar space,' said Leonard Burlaga, a . member of the team that looks after Voyager's magnetometer. 'The . magnetic field data turned out to be the key to pinpointing when we . crossed the termination shock. And we expect these data will tell us . when we first reach interstellar space.' Voyager 1 and its sister probe Voyager 2 launched 35 years ago on a tour of the outer planets. Voyager . 2 launched on August 20, 1977, about two weeks before Voyager 1. It is . now 9billion miles from the sun. Voyager 1 launched on September 5, . 1977, moving faster than its sister probe and eventually passing it. It is now more than 11 billion miles from the sun. The signal from Voyager 1 takes approximately 17 hours to travel to Earth. After hurtling into space, both probes have continued to travel toward the fringes of the solar system. Interstellar missions: A map of the Voyager tours through outer space . Saturn: an image of the sixth planet taken by Voyager 2 . Neptune: An image of the eight planet taken by Voyager 2 . The Voyagers are NASA's longest-running spacecraft, and will continue traveling after they have left the solar system. As . soon as Voyager 1 breaks through to interstellar space, it will be the . first man-made object to leave the solar system, Stone said. However, it would take at least 40,000 years before either probe came close to another star, Stone said. Long before that both Voyagers will run out of power and transmit their findings back home before shutting off for good. ‘We . will have enough power for all the instruments until 2020; at that . point we will have to turn off our first instrument,’ Stone said. Voyager 1 will have to be turned off by 2025.","Scientists have dubbed the new region the ‘magnetic highway’ and say it's the last stop before interstellar space, or the space between stars .

"A couple in upstate New York have been charged and could face one year in jail after their toddler used their cellphones to make more than 15 calls to 911 when there was no emergency. Heaven Britton, 23, and her boyfriend Jason Hatcher, 33, both of Lowville, were told by a Lewis County 911 Dispatch Center call-taker to hide their phones. It came after Britton's two-year-old daughter made a first call to emergency while playing with a cell. But then, throughout January, the little girl continued to find the phones and dial 9-1-1. Lock up the phone: Heaven Britton, 23, was charged with obstructing governmental administration - a misdemeanor charge - in Lowville, NY, on Thursday after her two-year-old made 15 unnecessary 911 calls . Britton's boyfriend, Jason R. Hatcher, 33, has also been charged and faces up to one year in jail . On Wednesday, Village of Lowville police officer Matthew Martin spoke to the pair after the persistent child made a 14th call. He warned them to keep all phones away from her or face further action, according to Syracuse. But the toddler made a 15th call later that night. Martin returned to the home, at 5497 Water St, Lowville, the next day and charged both Britton and Hatcher with obstructing governmental administration. The charge is a class A misdemeanor and carries a maximum penalty of one year jail. The calls were made from this address in Lowville, in upstate New York . After Heaven Britton was charged over the calls her daughter made to 911, police say the toddler dialed the number three more times the following day . It is usually dealt to people who argue with police officers or interfere with the arrest of another party. Despite the charges, Martin said the little girl called 911 three more times on Friday. Police believe there is no reason to suspect the child was in any harm or danger.","A 911 dispatcher in upstate New York told Heaven Britton, 23, to keep her phone away from her two-year-old daughter, who had made an emergency call .

"A cleric read the verdict before the truck came and dumped a large pile of stones near the municipal garden. Jihadi fighters brought in the woman, clad head to toe in black, and half buried her in the ground. Then they told residents who had gathered around the scene to carry out the sentence: Stoning to death for the alleged adulteress. None in the crowd stepped forward, said a witness to the event in a northern Syrian city. So the jihadi fighters, mostly foreign extremists, did it themselves, pelting Faddah Ahmad with rocks. Death by stoning: A cleric uses a loudspeaker to read out the sentence handed to Faddah Ahmad . Public execution: Hundreds of locals were gathered at the scene of the killing, which took place at 11pm . Carrying out the sentence: A witness said none in the crowd stepped forward, and it was left to the mainly foreign-born fighters from the Islamic State to pick up the stones and bludgeon Ms Ahmad to death . 'Even when she was hit with stones she did not scream or move,' said an opposition activist who said he witnessed the stoning near the football stadium in Raqqa, the main Syrian stronghold of the Islamic State group. The July 18 stoning was the second in a span of 24 hours. A day earlier, 26-year-old Shamseh Abdullah was killed in a similar way in the nearby town of Tabqa by IS fighters. She was also accused of having sex outside marriage, the Associated Press reports. The killings are believed to be the first of their kind in rebel-held northern Syria, where IS jihadis have seized large swaths of territory, terrorising residents with a strict interpretation of Islamic law, including beheadings and cutting off the hands of thieves. The jihadis recently tied a 14-year-old boy to a cross-like structure and left him for several hours in the scorching summer sun before bringing him down - punishment for not fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. This pictured posted by the Raqqa Media Centre, a Syrian opposition group, shows fighters from the Islamic State on parade in the city of Raqqa. Activists have reported two cases of stoning this month in that province . The stonings in Syria last month were not widely publicised at the time, but in the following days three photographs appeared online which appeared to document the grisly spectacle. The circumstances of the photos were consistent with other AP reporting. Pictures posted on a newly-created Twitter account showed dozens of people gathered in a square, a cleric reading a verdict through a loudspeaker and several bearded men with automatic rifles either carrying or collecting stones. 'A married woman being stoned in the presence of some believers,' read the caption of the photographs on the Twitter account, which has since been suspended. Abu Ibrahim Raqqawi, the activist who witnessed Ahmad's stoning, told AP that locals were angry to see foreign fighters impose their will on the community. 'People were shocked and couldn't understand what was going on. Many were disturbed by the idea that Saudis and Tunisians were issuing (such) orders,' he said in an interview via Skype. Ms Ahmad, he said, appeared unconscious, and he had overheard that she was earlier taken to a hospital where she was given anaesthesia. The stoning took place after dark, he said, at about 11pm. He could not see blood on the body because of the black clothes she was wearing. Ms Ahmad did not scream or shake. She died silently. 'They then took the dead body in one of their cars and left,' he said. The first case of stoning occurred in the town of Tabqa. A day after the July 17, 2014, stoning of Shamseh Mohammed Abdullah, 26, Faddah al-Sayed Ahmad was stoned to death in the provincial capital of Raqqa . The two cases were first reported by the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which collects information through a network of activists around the country. Bassam Al-Ahmad, a spokesman for the Violations Documentation Centre, a Syrian group that tracks human rights violations, also confirmed the stoning. An activist based in the northern province of Idlib, who collects information from other activists in northern Syria, said Ms Ahmad was a widow. A man who asked to be identified as Asad, a pseudonym, for fear of repercussions, said that in the other stoning, in Tabqa, residents also refused to take part, and that the act was carried out by Islamic State members. The U.S. Embassy in Syria, in a statement posted on its Twitter account, condemned the 'barbaric stoning' of a woman in Tabqa. International human rights groups did not report the stoning, and Human Rights Watch said it had no independent confirmation. 'It is a very worrying trend if true,' said Human Rights Watch researcher Lama Fakih. The Islamic State group has 'imposed incredibly restrictive rules on the civilian population which have served to make women and girls particularly vulnerable and to quite clearly discriminate against them,' she said, adding that the reports of the stoning were the first the group had received out of Syria. 'This is just a more sort of extreme manifestation of those restrictive rules which are all in violation of international' human rights law, she said.","Locals refused to take part in the barbaric executions in Raqqa, north Syria .

"Millions of viewers were left stunned . last night as Matthew Crawley was killed in a car crash moments after . seeing his newborn son in Downton Abbey’s Christmas Day special. The . much-loved character, played by Dan Stevens, died after swerving off the . road to avoid another vehicle. The fatal twist was so unforeseen that it took the breath away. In Downton Abbey, after two hours of premonitions that Lord Grantham’s oldest daughter, Mary, would suffer the fate of her sister Sybil and die in childbirth, an entirely different tragedy occurred. It happened off-screen: an open-topped roadster on a country lane, a looming lorry, and then a cut to Maggie Smith in the Abbey drawing room, reflecting that ‘we don’t always get our just deserts’. That was, for her, an uncharacteristic understatement. Mary’s husband, cousin Matthew, was bowling home from the maternity hospital, where he had just kissed hello to his baby son, born a few weeks premature. Unforeseen: Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) and his wife Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) and their baby. Matthew had just left the maternity hospital when he was killed in a car crash . He told his wife that he felt as if he’d swallowed a box of fireworks. She told him to remember the feeling, so that he’d forgive her more easily next time she did something silly... like crashing his precious car. Downton Abbey has never been Matthew’s story: it’s a family saga. And yet he has been the pivot, the axle for the free-wheeling plot. He was the war hero, the lover who was paralysed, the heir who could not father children, the saviour who saved the estate from bankruptcy. To see him, dead on the roadside, a thick bead of blood drooling from his ear, was a shock. This was the coup de grace in a Christmas season’s viewing that left no heartstring unwrung. Not only were Arthur and Gawain both dead in the final episode of Merlin, but the Doctor’s new companion suffered a fatal plunge from a cloud, just moments after she was given the key to the Tardis in Dr Who. But Matthew’s death was the  climax, a jaw-dropper in the final seconds of a two-hour Downton special. The rest of the episode was a bizarre summer holiday in Scotland for the aristocracy, and a day at the village fair for the below-stairs cast. Seconds from tragedy: In a shocking twist, Matthew is killed when he crashes his roadster on the way home from the hospital . The Granthams were off to a cousin at Duneagle Castle in the Highlands, for a spot of stalking. In the Twenties, that meant shooting wildlife with antlers, not lurking on footpaths for a glimpse of someone you fancy (although Thomas the footman did a spot of that, and got a beating from the local roughs as a result). The Highlands excursion meant magnificent Scottish scenery, but the effect was much the same as one of Coronation Street’s periodic mass outings to Blackpool. Storylines in the open air seemed melodramatic instead of intense. The vast glens and mountainsides could not compensate. As Lady Grantham remarked wearily: ‘That is the thing about nature, there’s so much of it.’ Goner! Matthew is killed in a car accident after rushing home to Downton to tell the family about his newborn son . Accident: After colliding with Matthew's car, the driver and passenger of the van rush to his aid . And then there was the question of what to wear in the evening. ‘I’m taking a diamond tiara,’ one character murmured. ‘Might not need it, but I’d rather be safe than sorry.’ To underline the ancestry of the series, and its direct descent from the Eighties classic Brideshead Revisited, Phoebe Nicholls appeared. She played a foul-tempered, nagging niece, but she hasn’t changed so much since she was Sebastian’s idealistic, ultra-Catholic little sister. The only Christmassy theme was the impending birth, a theme that Call The Midwife was able to play with clever and moving ways. From the first moment, when a nurse’s hands were washing a tiny wooden baby from the nativity scene, there were echoes and parallels with the Bethlehem story. Another loss for the family: Matthew's death paves the way for actor Dan Stevens' exit . Unaware: While Matthew is dying, his wife Lady Mary is cuddling their son in hospital . A child was born, not in a stable but in the communal toilet of a block of flats. Another baby was left in a cardboard box on the convent steps, and the episode hinged on the need to find the unmarried mother. In a poignant sub-plot, an old woman who had spent half her life in the workhouse was taken to find the graves of her children. The cause of death for all of them had been, in the evasive officialese of the day, ‘failure to thrive’ – in other words, malnourishment. For all its nostalgia, Call The Midwife is clear-eyed about the bad old days. But it is gleeful about an era before health and safety, too. As the caretaker struggled to get the Christmas tree lights working, he called out to a grubby-kneed boy, ‘Go on sonny, go and wiggle that plug for me. Clump it one.’ The lights duly blew up. Best line of the night went to the irritable nun who was about to set out on her Boxing Day rounds to give insulin injections to diabetics. ‘They’ll all have been at the Quality Street, every man-jack of them,’ she grumbled. ‘If I was the prime minister, I’d shut that factory down.’","Fatal twist was so unforeseen that it took the breath away .

"A Christian worker who claimed his Muslim employers discriminated against him because he was white has been awarded more than £2,500 in compensation. Christopher Turton, 31, was one of only two white workers at the National Halal Food Group in Birmingham, which supplies supermarkets with meat prepared in accordance with Islamic Sharia law. A tribunal heard that after Mr Turton was promoted at the company, he saw an e-mail in which a colleague suggested he was being given an unfair advantage, asking: 'Is it because he is white?'. 'Extremely offensive': Christopher Turton, 31, was one of only two white employees at the firm based on Harborne Road in Edgbaston (above), a tribunal heard . The e-mail, understood to have been sent from employee of the firm to a self-employed worker and seen by Mr Turton, also pointed out that the 31-year-old was not a 'Muslim brother' and added: 'Allah is the provider'. The worker also claimed Mr Turton had only been employed by the company to impress customers, the hearing was told. Mr Turton, from Halesowen in the West Midlands, was awarded £2,550 at an employment tribunal in Birmingham after seeking compensation from the Halal Food Group for race and religious discrimination. Tribunal judges found in the claimant's favour on both counts. The tribunal heard Mr Turton had introduced changes while employed by the firm in a bid to boost its income. But the changes were not wholly welcomed, said Sonny Jagpal, representing the respondents. Compensation: The West Midlands firm supplies retailers with meat prepared in accordance with Sharia law . Mr Jagpal said: 'The firm's management disapproved of the email and arranged a face-to-face meeting with those involved and issued an apology, those who sent the email have also apologised.' Tribunal judges heard that Mr Turton found the email 'extremely offensive', and that it caused him to sign off work with stress and eventually resign from the company. Tribunal judge Victoria Dean said Mr Turton had found the email racist and offensive and said there had been an injury to his feelings. She initially awarded him £3,000 but this was reduced to £2,550 because he had failed to lodge an official grievance to the firm. Ms Dean recommended the company issue instructions to the workforce and team leaders, within six months, about equal opportunities policies.","Christopher Turton, 31, one of only two white workers at Birmingham firm .

"A UFO supposedly spotted over an Australian suburb on Sunday night has raised questions about just what the object was. With flashing coloured lights in red, green and blue the aircraft hovered over the south-east Melbourne suburb of Carnegie for over an hour, according to residents. One local told News Corp the object was very strange and unlike anything she had ever come across before. 'Someone said it could be a helicopter but it’s not moving, it’s been there for an hour now', Toni Koromilas said. A Melbourne resident captured this 'bizarre' object hovering above homes in Carnegie . She added she may be way off track and the strange aircraft could have simply been a plane but admitted it looked 'bizarre'. 'Holy moly this thing keeps coming back to Carnegie we need to figure out why', Perry Vlahos from the Astronomical Society of Victoria Inc jokingly told Daily Mail Australia when asked about the object. 'I saw it first about three weeks ago so I followed it because I thought ""what is going on here"",' Mr Vlahoas said. He trailed it close to a nearby park before he realised what it was. 'If you went into the park I think you would find teenagers with some remotes in their hands he said, before Mr Vlahos added he believes it to be no more than a toy  drone or gyro-copter fitted out with some impressive LED lights. 'If not, we need to figure out what it is about Carniege', Mr Vlahos said. The object has been spotted numerous times in the area lately, hovering 100-200 metres off the ground, usually around 9pm. The aircraft was apparently flashing with blue, red and green lights but the Astronomical Society of Victoria Inc said it was nothing more than a drone or gyro-copter . UFO sightings are reported in Melbourne at least once a week according to local monitors, and instances are apparently on the rise in Queensland too. 'In the last couple of years there's been an increase of reports from the Gold Coast area', president of UFO Research Queensland Sheryl Gottschall told Daily Mail Australia. She revealed her association gets about 100 reports per year, but they are just one of many groups around Australia keeping track of sightings. Ms Gottschall said she herself had a number of sightings and what she described as a 'close encounter' while living in Brisbane. 'I was living at Mount Gravatt and it was in the early hours of the morning... I saw three small beings standing beside my bed', she revealed. The creatures were apparently two to three feet tall with inverted heads and 'wrap around black eyes'. 'I was terror-struck', Ms Gottschall said. 'People see things and try to put these experiences in context, which doesn't always work ... There's a high strangeness factor to these experiences people have.'","A UFO was spotted over a Melbourne suburb on Sunday night .

"It would make Britain's recent cold weather seem like a heatwave. Scientists have discovered the coldest place on Earth - where the air temperature plummets to below -91C. The newly-found spot - situated along an Antarctic mountain ridge - could freeze a human's eyes, nose and lungs within minutes. Record-breaking: Scientists have discovered the coldest place on Earth along an Antarctic mountain ridge - where the temperature plummets to below a deadly -91C (file picture) This is because its temperature is almost 13 degrees below the point at which CO2 transforms from a gas into dry ice (-78.5C). The record-breaking discovery was made by researchers from America's National Snow and Ice Data Centre, according to The Sunday Times. They used satellites and other techniques to measure temperatures in Antarctica. The -91.2C spot - one of numerous cold places recorded on the mountain ridge - is believed to have been found at heights of more than 12,400ft on a mountain called Dome Fuji. Astonishingly, it is even chillier than Russia's Vostok research station, where the world's previous coldest air temperature (-89.2C) was recorded during the Antarctic winter of 1983. Previous record holder: The spot is even chillier than Russia's Vostok research station, pictured, where the world's previous coldest air temperature (-89.2C) was recorded in 1983 .

'It . is likely that record cold sites identified by the data have small . areas within them that are significantly colder than the grid cell . mean,' said a data centre researcher in a . published summary of the findings. He added that the coldest temperatures had been recorded during clear, dry periods - as opposed to on windy or snowy days. Full details of the scientists' discovery will be revealed at the American Geophycial Union's annual meeting this week.

A single shop provides the town's bare necessities - with he locals working as reindeer-breeders, hunters and ice-fisherman. In comparison, the coldest temperature Britain has ever seen is -27.2C, which was recorded in 1995 at Altnaharra in the Scottish Highlands.","Spot on Antarctic mountain ridge sees temperatures of below -91C .

"One was the American president, the other was a loner, and yet by chance there was one woman who knew them both. Priscilla Johnson McMillan knew John F. Kennedy as a senator, when she advised him on Asia. She interviewed Lee Harvey Oswald years later when she was a Russian correspondent for the North American News Alliance. Scroll down for video . Remembering: Priscilla Johnson McMillan remembers meeting Oswald after she worked for JFK . Crossed paths: Ms McMillan explains how Oswald was spurred on by a sense of fate as JFK passed his shop . Half a century on, the 85-year-old has spoken out about the assassination. Despite decades of speculation in books, articles and documentaries, she remains certain Oswald committed the crime. And Kennedy, she says, would 'want to know why this young man had nothing better to do than go out and shoot someone.' I was sorry for him because he seemed lost and as if he really didn't know what to do . - Priscilla Johnson McMillan on Oswald . Ms McMillan was living in Moscow in 1959 when she was asked by US embassy officials to reason with a dissident. Coerced into meeting the former US Marine . by negotiators who thought he might respond better to a woman, . she was struck by how young he looked. 'He thought he was a great man who was going to assert himself for history,' she told Fox News, recalling her six-hour interview with Oswald in her hotel room during his bid to renounce his American citizenship to move to the Soviet Union. 'He looked like a college boy,' she said. 'I was sorry for him because he seemed lost and as if he really didn't know what to do.' Infamous: 50 years ago today, President John F. Kennedy lay dead in the back seat of the Presidential limousine as it sped along Elm Street; his wife Jackie climbs onto the boot of the car to the Secret Service Agent . The Grassy Knoll: The spot where the assassin is believed to have been when the president was shot in 1963 . Like millions of others, she was lost for words on November 22, 1963, when Kennedy was shot. But as the day progressed and Oswald was arrested, her day took a strange turn. 'My God,' she remembers saying, 'I know that boy'. He was motivated, she claims, by Marxist ideologies, and provoked by mental problems, a broken marriage, and a peculiar sense of 'fate' as Kennedy's car drove past his shop. And she says with no doubt that he acted alone. 'He knew there was something wrong with himself, but he had these other things, delusions that he was something bigger than he was. 'He even told me in defecting to the Soviet Union that he ""wanted to give the people of the United States something to think about"".' Unexpected friendship: Marina Oswald (left) and Priscilla Johnson McMillan (right) became friends as Ms McMillan wrote her book about JFK's assassination. They are pictured with friend Jerre Hastings . Widow: Marina Porter, Oswald's Russian wife, here in 1977, had grown fearful as her husband plotted attacks . She added that Oswald clearly intended the trial to be a political show trial by attempting to secure John Abt, the American Communist Party's chief counsel, as his attorney. In the years that followed, Priscilla embarked on a journey to uncover the background. She made friends with Marina Porter, Oswald's Russian widow, who was living in Texas by that point. The couple had met and married in the Soviet Union years before and had two children, before moving back to America. Having already suffered mentally for years, his marriage struggled as he obsessively plotted to shoot people opposing the communist movement. He would want to know why he died, he'd . want to know why this young man had nothing better to do than go out . and shoot someone, much less go out and shoot him. - On her friend, Jack . Years after Kennedy's murder, detectives connected him with the attempted shooting of anti-communist Army officer General Edwin A. Walker from his living room window in April 1963. At one point, Marina told Priscilla, he announced he was going out to find Nixon. She locked him in the bathroom and grew fearful he was becoming violent. In the months that followed, Marina left him, taking the children, and refused his pleas to reconsider. The night before the attack in Dallas, he removed his wedding ring in an act that Priscilla believes was to protect Marina. Paying tribute to the eponymous president, Mc McMillan reflected on his character. She said: 'Kennedy was always asking questions, asking questions, he asked me many, many questions. Legend: JFK, walking onto Love Field in Dallas on November 22, 1963, an hour before his death, is now an icon . 'He would want to know why he died, he'd want to know why this young man had nothing better to do than go out and shoot someone, much less go out and shoot him.' It is one of numerous memories expressed today to mark the anniversary of his death. Flags are being flown at half-mast throughout the US today in what President Obama has declared a Day of Remembrance. Last night, the Kennedy family both mourned and rejoiced, as they welcomed JFK's great-niece into the world. Political: Lee Harvey Oswald would have wanted the trial to be a political show trial, Ms McMillan believes . Nora Kara Kennedy, daughter of Amy and Patrick Kennedy, JFK's nephew, was born at 3.11pm on Tuesday at New Jersey Hospital. Mr Kennedy, 47, said that although it is a bittersweet week, this 'made it a whole lot sweeter'. He told NBC10: 'I think this is so symbolic of the circle of life and how life keeps moving forward. 'We can look back in time and think about what would have been had my uncles lived but we have to live for today and we have to live for the future and they would want us to do that and that's why this marks such a special occasion.'","Priscilla Johnson McMillan, 85, was an advisor to Kennedy as a senator .

"A bungling Iranian bomber blew off his own legs when he hurled a grenade at Thai police outside a Bangkok school - which bounced off a tree and then exploded at his feet. A bizarre sequence of explosions in the capital of Bangkok started this morning when a stash of explosives blew off the roof of a house occupied by three Iranians. Two of the men quickly ran away while Saeid Moradi, who was seriously wounded, staggered out and tried to wave down a taxi. Covered in blood, the driver refused to take him, and so he hurled a grenade at the vehicle. When police arrived on the scene he then tried to throw another at officers - but it bounced off a tree, landed at his feet, and blew off his legs. Mistake: Iranian Saeid Moradi, who is still alive, had his legs blown off after a grenade he hurled bounced back onto him, as police closed in on him outside a Bangkok school . Investigation: A Thai Explosive Ordnance Disposal team member analyses the damage following the blasts in Bangkok while a large crowd gathers at the scene- many taking pictures . Moradi, who was taken to hospital, . injured four people in the blasts which come the day after Israeli . diplomats were targeted in simultaneous car bombings, also believed to . have been carried out by Iranians. Photographs and video footage of the wounded Moradi showed him covered in dark soot on a pavement strewn with broken glass. He lay in front of a Thai primary and secondary school, head raised as if he was attempting to sit up or look around. It is not yet known if yesterday's and . today's attacks are linked - but Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said the Bangkok violence 'proves once again that Iran and its proxies continue to perpetrate terror'. Another government minister implied Israel would seek revenge, without mentioning Iran explicitly. And public security minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch told Israel Radio: 'We know who carried out the terror attacks, we know who sent them, and Israel will settle the score with them.' More explosives were found at Moradi's house, in the Ekamai area of central Bangkok, which police say he had been renting with two others. He is believed to have arrived in Bangkok, from the southern Thai resort of Phuket, on February 8. Peace: The bomber lies seriously wounded on the pavement while emergency services wait for the area to be made safe before going in to assist . Carnage: A bomb disposal expert checks out the damage, which also hit a police car . Warning: Israel and the U.S. have told their citizens to be alert in the capital . Police said security forces at Bangkok's international airport detained a second Iranian later today. Mohummad Hazaei, one of the men in . the house where the explosives first went off, was trying to board a . flight for Malaysia. They said a third Iranian - believed wounded in . that initial explosion - was also on the run. Thailand has rarely been a target for . foreign terrorists, although a domestic Muslim insurgency in the . country's south has involved bombings of civilian targets. Israel and the U.S. warned their . citizens to be alert in the capital, but Thai authorities said the . country appeared to have been a staging ground but not the target of any . attack. It comes the day after Israeli . diplomats were targeted in simultaneous bomb plots which were also . blamed on Iran. It is not known whether the attacks are linked. A bomb attached magnetically to a car in . the Indian capital New Delhi exploded and injured the wife of an Israeli . official and two bystanders. Officials in Georgia said an explosive device was attached to the bottom of a diplomat’s car in the capital Tbilisi, but was found and defused before it detonated. Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran was behind both incidents, adding that the Islamic republic's Lebanese ally Hezbollah - which battled Israel in a month-long war in 2006 - could have been involved too. Last month, a Lebanese-Swedish man with alleged links to Hezbollah militants was detained by Thai police. He led authorities to a warehouse filled with more than 4,000kilos of urea fertiliser and several gallons of liquid ammonium nitrate.

"The BBC came under fire today for a new sitcom which makes light of assisted suicide. A new series starring Blake Harrison, of the Inbetweeners, tells the story of three young men who build a suicide machine and offer the 'service' to those who wish to end their lives. But a prominent Tory MP expressed his disgust at the programme's premise, slamming it for turning suicide into a joke. Criticism: Tory MP Mark Pritchard, left, has criticised the BBC for a new sitcom starring Inbetweeners actor Black Harrison, right, which makes a joke of assisted suicide . Mark Pritchard, MP for The Wrekin, told the Sunday Express: 'It is a sad fact that assisted dying is now regarded as a 'revenue stream' to some foreign clinics and clearly as a matter of fun by some parts of the BBC.' The six-part black comedy, called Way To Go, was written by Bob Kushell, a veteran comedy producer who has contributed to The Simpsons and Third Rock From The Sun. In one scene of the programme, due to air on BBC3 this month, the lever of the machine is pulled to deliver a fatal dose, killing Harrison's next door neighbour in seconds. Another scene shows Harrison's friend telephoning him from a pub with a potential client. 'He's got stomach cancer. How fantastic is that?' he says. Last year a Europe-wide poll showed that nearly three-quarters of British people are in favour of legalising assisted suicide. The survey, carried out on behalf of the Swiss Medical Lawyers Association (SMLA), found large majorities in 12 western European countries supported the right of people to choose when and how they die. Two-thirds to three-quarters of respondents said they could imagine opting for assisted suicide themselves if they suffered from an incurable illness, serious disability or uncontrollable pain. One way ticket: The Dignitas clinic in Pfaeffikon near Zurich, Switzerland, which was among the first in Europe to offer assisted suicide . In Britain, 71 per cent said they might seek assisted suicide while Greece was the most reluctant with 56 per cent saying they might do so. The practice is now allowed in only four countries on the continent, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The German government has proposed legalising the practice as long as no profit is involved - while France is also debating whether to allow it. But whether people are ready to see television comedians making light of the subject is yet to be seen. Defending the forthcoming comedy, BBC3 controller Zai Bennett told the Sunday Express: 'Bob Kushell's scripts are in turn dark, poignant, absurd, moving and brilliant. 'I'm thrilled that Way To Go is coming to BBC3.'","Way To Go tells story of three men who start an assisted suicide business .

"Soaring property prices mean that in some areas houses earned more in the last year than the people living in them. From Birmingham to Brighton, London to south Wales, annual salaries were outstripped by increases in average house prices, research by MailOnline reveals. The data comes as Chancellor George Osborne moves to tighten the amount buyers can borrow, adding to fears that many people will struggle to ever get on to the property ladder. Across England and Wales there were 33 areas where house prices rose by more in cash terms than annual local wages, MailOnline research reveals . Across England and Wales, average house prices rose by 7 per cent in the year to April to £172,069, worth an extra £10,809, according to Land Registry figures. By comparison, median earnings in 2013 were £22,045. However, in some areas the buoyant market added thousands - and tens of thousands - to property prices. The biggest rise recorded was in Westminster, in central London, where prices rose by an astonishing £160,810 to £976,822 in a year. Even in the shadow of Big Ben, median average annual salaries in the borough last year were £34,092. The story was repeated across much of London, with prices up £125,788 in Hackney, where pay was only £27,895, and up £126,587 in Hammersmith where average wages were £33,082. Outside London, prices rose by £42,411 in Windsor and Maidenhead compared to average salaries of £29,501. In his Mansion House speech last week, Mr Osborne unveiled plans to give the Bank of England new powers to limit the amount people can borrow. New rules will cap the size of loans to a multiple of the borrower's earnings, meaning that in areas where prices are rising by more than locals earn in a year, it will become even harder to buy a home. In the year to March, property prices in London rose by 17 per cent, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics . Nationwide, prices are rising by around 8 per cent, but in some areas the increase is worth more than the average person earns . Chancellor George Osborne last week announced he was giving the Bank of England new powers to limit loans relative to earnings, while Bank governor Mark Carney hinted interest rates could rise before the end of this year . On the south coast, average earnings in Brighton and Hove stood at £22,740 but house prices rose by £28,702. In Sandwell, on the outskirts of Birmingham, homes rose by £21,945 but average incomes stood at £18,934. In Wales two areas saw prices earn more than local workers. Powys recorded property price rises of £25,621 in a year, while annual earnings were just £17,725. In the Vale of Glamorgan, house prices were up £23,124, almost £1,300 more than the average worker in the area earned. The figures for earnings are pre-tax, so the gap between take-home pay and property price rises will be even greater. Emma Reynolds, Labour’s shadow housing minister, said: 'These figures show that the dream of home ownership is slipping further out of reach for working people. 'To tackle this crisis we need to build many more homes which is why Labour have repeatedly called for action on housing supply but this government has failed to act. Under David Cameron the number of homes built has fallen to the lowest level in peacetime since the 1920s. 'Labour is clear that you can’t deal with the cost-of-living crisis without building more homes. That’s why Labour has committed to getting 200,000 homes a year built by 2020.' Booming house prices have trigged warnings that Britain could be heading for a new bust. The International Monetary Fund warned action was needed around the world to prevent a global crash. Labour's shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said the research showed the dream of home ownership is slipping further out of reach . Bank of England governor Mark Carney has hinted that interest rates could rise from their historic low before the end of the year, shattering hopes that any increase would be delayed until after the election in May next year. There have been fears that the taxpayer-backed mortgages offered through the Help to Buy scheme were increasing demand while the supply of new homes remained low. Business Secretary Vince Cable, a long-term critic of the scheme, warned banks must not ‘throw fuel on the fire’ of the overheating market by offering cheap loans to people who can barely afford them. Housing Minister Kris Hopkins said:'Mortgage lending and loan-to-value ratios on new lending remain below historic average – in fact relative to earnings, median house prices across England are around the same level as in 2005. 'Help to Buy has helped thousands of hardworking people buy a new home, with some of the highest sales figures in cities including Manchester Leeds and Durham. Leading developers are building more as a direct result of the scheme, with housebuilding up a third compared to last year and at its highest level since 2007.' Property prices across London rose by 17 per cent in the year to April, more than double the average for England and Wales. The highest rises outside London were in the South East and East, up 8 per cent, and the lowest in the North East and Wales, just 3 per cent. Flats rose by 10 per cent, while all house – terraced, semi- and detached – were up by 6 per cent. Some 20 areas saw values fall in the year to April, including Blaenau Gwent down 32 per cent, Torfaen 15 per cent and Blackburn 12 per cent. Prices in Tameside were down 4 per cent, Manchester 3 per cent and Lancashire 2 per cent. Former property developer and iProperty co-founder John Candia said: 'It is extraordinary to think that some London homeowners are on course to earn more from their properties in one year than the Prime Minister makes for running the country.' However, there have been signs that the market may be cooling. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors found demand for properties from prospective buyers slipped back last month for the first time since June 2012. This is being blamed in part on a mortgage lending clampdown which came into force at the end of April. Under the new Mortgage Market Review (MMR) rules, mortgage applicants face a tougher application process and questions about their spending habits to check they would be able to cope with a rise in interest rates in the future.","MailOnline research reveals how increase in prices is higher than salaries .

"Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has hailed Louis Van Gaal as a 'nice guy' as he prepares to pit his wits against the veteran Dutchman in the Barclays Premier League next season. Van Gaal has signed a three-year contract to take over at Old Trafford after the World Cup, with Ryan Giggs as his assistant. Mourinho, who worked under Van Gaal at Barcelona in 1997, said: 'He is a great football manager and I am happy he joins me in the same country and the Premier League. But more important than that, he's a great guy, a great man and I wish him good.' Bring it on: Jose Mourinho, who was unveiled as the new United Nations World Food Programme Ambassador Against Hunger, has welcomed new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal to the Premier League . New role: Mourinho was with Amir Abdulla from the World Food Programme in London on Monday . Former United assistant manager Mike Phelan said Van Gaal's 'strong personality' would make him the ideal fit to step into the considerable shoes of Sir Alex Ferguson. Phelan worked with Ferguson for three years before departing alongside the Scot last summer. Phelan told BBC Five Live: 'I've met [Van Gaal] a couple of times and he's got a very strong personality about him. 'But at a club like Manchester United, that's what is required. You have to hit the ground running and I'm sure he will do. 'There's been a lot of talk about Van Gaal and his methods but he does the job a manager has to do and he's a very good coach.' The future's bright, the future's orange: Holland manager Van Gaal has been confirmed as United's new boss . Phelan said he expected Van Gaal not to be overawed by the prospect of taking over such a big club and would set to work immediately to improve the squad after a disappointing campaign under David Moyes. He added: 'He's not stepped into the shoes of Sir Alex and all the history that comes with Sir Alex, and he's now going to have to get the players to perform better than they have done in the past season. 'There's a lot of talk about new players coming into the club and I'm sure when the new manager comes in he'll have his favourites. 'Man United have said they have money to spend so I'm sure as a manager he'll spend it. I think this time because of the disappointing season they had last year there is room for changes.'","Louis van Gaal takes charge of Man United after the World Cup .

"Protecting his name: Sabrina Fulton filed a patent application for the phrases 'I am Trayvon' and 'Justice for Trayvon' The mother of slain Trayvon Martin recently filed a trademark to protect the rights to his name as an attempt to control- and collect funds from- the masses of merchandise being produced in support of their cause. It was revealed today that Sabrina Fulton, the boy’s mother, filed two petitions last week to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to specifically gain the rights to the phrases ‘I Am Trayvon’ and ‘Justice For Trayvon’, both of which have been frequently used by protesters across the country. The trademark application shows that she is specifically looking for control of the use of those phrases on CDs and DVDs that feature her deceased son. Interestingly, the application makes . no mention of other merchandise that may use those phrases, and t-shirts . and hoodie sweatshirts are notably absent from the listing, meaning . that she would not collect any monetary payment if someone were to sell . clothes with those words on them. A . wide variety of t-shirts, pins, buttons and banners are being sold in . Florida and have been ever since the fatal shooting of 17-year-old . Trayvon Martin became a national issue, flaring fraught racial tensions . throughout the state and the country. The sale of merchandise has sped up in . recent weeks, and will likely continue strong as rallies continue to be . held in Sanford, Florida, where the incident occurred on February 26. SCROLL DOWN FOR THE VIDEO . Demanding answers: Ms Fulton (center) and her ex-husband Tracy Martin (pointing) appeared in a Sanford, Florida city hearing on Monday as the push for action continues . Calling for action: Supporters have made a plethora of different t-shirts, all with the same essential message . Shirts with the phrases that Ms Fulton just trademarked are available for sale online for $20 to $25 each. Most of the t-shirts call for the . arrest of the teen’s shooter, George Zimmerman, though one that was . revealed on Monday goes a step further. Local . rapper Plies was photographed in a t-shirt with ‘P***Y A** CRACKER’ surrounding a photo of Zimmerman, using a lyric from one of his songs . about a judge who gives large sentences to black defendants. Other . t-shirts chose to stick to the facts of the case, saying that the teen . only had a pack of Skittles and a bottle of iced tea on him at the time . of the altercation. Some, . including former NAACP leader C. L. Bryant, feel that the attention . surrounding the case has turned it away from the actual issues at hand . and created a circus around the tragic death of a child. Specifically . Reverend Bryant called out Reverends Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson for . exploiting the case to increase their own profiles. Continued fight: The family's lawyers arranged a large march through Sanford on Monday with many supporters wearing t-shirts with the slain teen's image . Wearing the message: Shirts and hoodies honoring Trayvon are available for sale throughout Florida and the U.S. ‘His family should be outraged by the . fact that they’re using this child as the bait to inflame racial . passions,’ Mr Bryant told The Daily Caller. He added that the two famed community leaders are ‘acting as though they are buzzards circling the carcass of this young boy’. The . trademark application was handled by a different team of lawyers than . the ones representing Ms Fulton and her ex-husband Tracy Martin. Kimra . Major-Morris and Natalie Jackson were the two lawyers from the Orlando, . Florida firm The Women’s Group who filed the application. Exploitive? One former NAACP leader says that the Reverends Al Sharpton (center) and Jesse Jackson (right) are exploiting the pain of Trayvon's parents (Ms Fulton on the left and Mr Martin on the right) It cost $325 to file each of the patent and trademark applications, and it does not specify how much Ms Fulton stands to make off of each time someone violates the trademark. Ms Fulton's lawyer, Ms Major Morris, told the Associated Press that the money that will be gathered from the trademark will go to 'projects that will assist other families who experience similar tragedies'. She denied that Ms Fulton had any intention of profiting from the move. The legal team handling the trademarks are completely separate from the firm of Parks and Crump who are representing the family and collecting donations from the public for their legal fees. Over the weekend, Trayvon’s parents urged supporters to make sure they were not donating to a string of fake sites that claim to be associated with the cause, but instead only give to those at Parks and Crump.

"Hayley Martin, 29, is battling bowel cancer and refuses to find out who long she has to life. She is pictured with her son Freddie . A young mother with terminal cancer has told doctors she doesn’t want to know how long she has to live, so she can enjoy time with her baby boy. Hayley Martin, 29, was given the all clear after battling bowel cancer and gave birth to her son, Freddie, in May last year. She has now been told that her disease is inoperable and she is undergoing chemotherapy in a bid to prolong her life and spend time with her family. Ms Martin, from Maidstone in Kent, had put her lack of energy down to being busy at work after struggling with tiredness for ten years. But after being taken to hospital with stomach pains in 2011, she was diagnosed with bowel cancer. After surgery and six months of chemotherapy, Ms Martin was told there was no sign of the cancer and against the odds, gave birth to her only child Freddie. But when her son was just four months old, doctors told her that the cancer had returned and is now inoperable. She has since been undergoing chemotherapy in a bid to control the cancer and prolong her life. However, the young mother has said that she doesn’t want to know how long she has left. Ms Martin said: ‘When you hear that diagnosis you feel for your family. 'I worried about my mum, dad and sister and how they would deal with it. ‘And, of course, I thought of not being able to see my one-year-old boy grow up. But after a few days I just wanted to fight it. ‘I don’t live with a terminal diagnosis and I haven’t asked how much time I have got. I just try to live a normal life. ‘I always do my make-up even when I’m . having my chemo, and when I’m not in the ward I have different wigs that . I wear. It just makes you feel better. Hayley Martin, 29, (pictured left) was given the all clear after battling bowel cancer and gave birth to her son  in May last year. She has now been told that her disease is inoperable and she is undergoing chemotherapy in a bid to prolong her life and spend time with her family, including fiancé Chris Griffin and Freddie (pictured right) Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in England. It is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel. Symptoms include passing blood and unexplained changes in bowel habits, such as prolonged diarrhoea or constipation, as well as weight loss. Approximately 72 per cent of bowel cancer cases develop in people aged 65 or older. Bowel cancer can be treated using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy. If bowel cancer is diagnosed in its earliest stages, the chance of surviving a further five years is 90 per cent, and a complete cure is usually possible. However, bowel cancer diagnosed in its most advanced stage only has a five-year survival rate of 6 per cent and a complete cure is unlikely. ‘I still work, I go out with my friends and on holidays and to the gym like everybody else.' After her first round of chemotherapy Ms Martin had resigned herself to never having children, after doctors told her the treatment often renders women unable to conceive. So when she and her fiancé Chris Griffin, 24,  found out they were going to have a baby, the couple were delighted. Freddie arrived last September and is approaching his first birthday. And Ms Martin said she hopes to tie the knot with Mr Griffin this summer. She said: ‘When you have chemo you always have the fear that you can’t have children, but I was lucky that at that time I was clear of cancer, or that I thought I was. ‘I was over the moon when I found out I was pregnant - I didn’t know I had cancer at the time. He is my little miracle. ‘I know my little boy is going to be well looked after in the future. ‘I have already put his name down for the school I want him to go to and, of course, I have life insurance.’ Ms Martin said: 'When you hear that diagnosis you feel for your family. I worried about my mum, dad and sister and how they would deal with it. And, of course, I thought of not being able to see my one-year-old boy grow up. But after a few days I just wanted to fight it.'

"Not everybody would feel as relaxed lying in a hammock strung thousands of feet up in the air between mountains. But then these thrill-seekers high up in the northern Italian Alps aren't just anybody. They are members of a group of extreme athletes who have travelled to take part in the International Highline Meeting  in Monte Piana, Italy. The inaugural meeting took place in 2012, when Monte Piana was identified as a great place for the sport, easily accessible and with a glorious past and a fairy tale atmosphere. The highliners came together for a week to practice their sport in harmony with nature and without mutual showdown, and it was such a success that now the meeting takes place annually. There are seemingly no end of daredevils who like nothing better than to take up the challenges posed by highwire walking. From natural geographical features such as waterfalls and gorges, to man-made objects such as skyscrapers and suspension bridges, tightrope walkers have attempted to walk across them all - with varying degrees of success. It's a physical accomplishment which is not for the the faint of heart. Not at that altitude anyway. Perhaps they are secretly trying to emulate that great high wire walker Jean Francois Gravelet, alias Charles Blondin, of France, who made the earliest crossing of the Niagara Falls on a three-inch rope  1,100ft long and 160ft above the Falls in 1859. Blondin thereafter made each crossing of the Falls in a different manner: blindfolded; trundling a wheelbarrow; on stilts, once with a man on his back, and once and sitting down halfway to make an omelette. These guys look like cooking a few eggs while they chill out in hammocks wouldn't be far beyond them. Scroll down for video .

Clingon: An extreme athlete makes the walk across a wire strung between the Italian Alps thousands of feet above ground level . Nearly there: After his long walk across this tightrope enthusiast is almost at the other side . Now get back up there: Losing your footing results in the inevitable, but a small safety rope stops this high wire enthusiast from plummeting to his death .

Highliners tighten the webbings between rocks so they can continue to try new routes across the gorge . That's fairly high! This shot shows just how far above the ground these thrill seekers are as they nonchalantly walk across the webbings . Then three came along all at once: Highliners chat to each other, strung hundreds of feet above the ground .

"President Obama believes that marijuana is not as dangerous as alcohol and that the ban in most states unfairly targets the poor and minorities. In an interview with the New Yorker, the president stated that marijuana use is not something that he would suggest for his daughters or anyone else, but prohibition has become a problem for the U.S. 'As has been well documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life. I don’t think it is more dangerous,' Mr Obama said. Liberal view: In an interview with the New Yorker, President Obama stated that he believes marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol . Marijuana has been a taboo topic for politicians, and even caused former President Bill Clinton some troubles while running for office in 1992 when it was revealed he smoked pot while studying in England, and he responded that he 'didn't inhale' and 'didn't try it again'. President Obama on the other hand, has been far more candid, admitting to smoking pot and even taking cocaine in his 1995 memoir Dreams of My Father. 'I think that, at this stage, my life is an open book, literally and figuratively,' he said while running for Senate in Illinois. 'Voters can make a judgment as to whether dumb things that I did when I was a teenager are relevant to the work that I've done since that time.' By 2008, voter sentiment across the U.S. had relaxed on the issue of marijuana enough that it didn't seem to factor much in his campaign. In the New Yorker interview, Mr Obama clarified that he believes pot is less dangerous than alcohol 'in terms of its impact on the individual consumer. It's not something I encourage, and I've told my daughters I think it's a bad idea,  a waste of time, not very healthy.' But the most troubling aspect of the federal ban on marijuana is it's impact on specific segments of the population - especially African-Americans like himself. The future: American opinion seems to be falling in line with Mr Obama following the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington State. Above, a legal Denver dispensary . 'Middle-class kids don’t get locked up for smoking pot, and poor kids do,' he said. 'And African-American kids and Latino kids are more likely to be poor and less likely to have the resources and the support to avoid unduly harsh penalties.' 'We should not be locking up kids or individual users for long stretches of jail time when some of the folks who are writing those laws have probably done the same thing,' Mr Obama added. Following the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington State, the tide seems to be turning towards a more liberal view of pot usage. The president said it's important for legalization to happen in Colorado and Washington because 'it’s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished.' At the same time, Mr Obama believes legalizing marijuana is going to be a challenge for the two states, and that legalizing the substance nationwide lead society in the wrong direction. 'I also think that, when it comes to harder drugs, the harm done to the user is profound and the social costs are profound. And you do start getting into some difficult line-drawing issues,' Mr Obama said. 'If marijuana is fully legalized and at some point folks say, well, we can come up with a negotiated dose of cocaine that we can show is not any more harmful than vodka, are we open to that? If somebody says, We’ve got a finely calibrated dose of meth, it isn’t going to kill you or rot your teeth, are we O.K. with that?'","In an interview with the New Yorker, Mr Obama said that the federal ban unfairly targets minorities and the poor .

"Britain's biggest offshore wind farm with turbines up to 650ft high will dwarf views of the Isle of Wight, the United Nations has warned. Nearly 200 towers, spanning an area larger than Manchester, are proposed just nine miles off Dorset’s unique Jurassic Coast. But in an explosive letter to the Government, the UN’s Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) has said the project would significantly affect the coastline and could threaten its status as England’s only natural World Heritage Site. Unesco insists that the £3.5 billion French-Dutch Navitus Bay development – with up to 194 turbines, each the height of London’s ‘Gherkin’ building – will ‘dominate’ the area and change the seascape for ever. Local opponents to the plan say it will devastate tourism in the area. Unesco director Kishore Rao wrote to the Department for Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) which is responsible for managing the World Heritage site along 95 miles of the stunning Dorset and Devon coastline. Earlier this year, DCMS claimed to Unesco that the Government-backed wind farm would have little impact on the Jurassic Coast. But Unesco has commissioned its own advisory study and in a strongly worded letter seen by the Mail on Sunday, Mr Rao said it ‘considers the project will have a significant impact on the natural setting of the property (the Jurassic Coast), in that it would adversely impact on important views’. Nearly 200 towers, spanning an area larger than Manchester, are proposed just nine miles off Dorset's unique Jurassic Coast . He went on: ‘The project would replace the Isle of Wight as the dominant feature on the horizon. 'This is likely to significantly impact on visitors’ experience and appreciation of the property which could compromise the long-term sustainability of the management of the property. ‘Any potential impacts on this natural property are in contradiction to the overarching principle of the World Heritage Convention... The property will change from being located in a natural setting largely free from human-made structures to one dominated by human-made structures.’ Should the proposal be given the go-ahead, the developers expect the first turbines to come online in 2019 and provide power for 700,000 homes. Dr Andrew Langley, of opposition group Challenge Navitus, said: ‘The Navitus Bay wind farm would completely change the character of views from Durlston Castle near Swanage. ‘The decision by the Crown Estate in 2009 to designate this zone so close to England’s only natural World Heritage Site, two areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and a national park, was extremely surprising.’ Impact assessments carried out by Navitus Bay itself found that up to a third of visitors could be deterred from holidaying in the area during the construction phase. And once the wind farm is in operation, 14 per cent of visitors said the loss of view would prevent them from returning. Bournemouth council’s head of tourism Mark Smith said that could mean thousands of people losing their jobs. ‘We’re very concerned. If the figures that Navitus is using are right, it would devastate tourism and result in massive unemployment,’ he added. Last night, Mike Unsworth, project director at Navitus Bay, said: ‘We are aware of the letter from Unesco  to the DCMS. 'We will be seeking  further clarification as the interim comments are not aligned with the independent impact assessment or the conclusion of DCMS.’","The towers, spanning  area larger than Manchester, are proposed just nine miles off Dorset’s unique Jurassic Coast .

"President Obama has called the fatal shooting of unarmed Missouri teen Michael Brown 'heartbreaking', in a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon. The president, who is currently vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, offered his 'deepest condolences' to the family of the 18-year-old who was shot up to eight times by a police officer, who witnesses claim then fired on Brown as he lay wounded on the street. The message from the president was followed by one from Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, who was asked if she had a message to the policeman who shot her son. She said: 'If he did something wrong, you know you did something wrong. You take your punishment. If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.' The days since the incident, which unfolded in broad daylight on Saturday, have been marked by riots and looting by Brown's incensed supporters who have clashed with heavily-armed police on the streets of suburban St. Louis. Scroll Down for Video . Vacation: President Barack Obama selects a club while golfing at Vineyard Golf Club on Tuesday in Edgartown, on the island of Martha's Vineyard. The president issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon regarding the shooting of unarmed Missouri teenager Michael Brown . Relaxing: President Barack Obama, smiles as he gives a pat on the arm to Cyrus Walker, cousin of White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, while golfing at Vineyard Golf Club on Tuesday . 'The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time,' said the president in his statement on the teens controversial death. 'I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,' the President said in the statement. Michael . Brown, 18, was shot dead on Saturday night in St Louis by a cop after . witnesses said he walked towards them with his hands in the air . 'We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.' Seeking to diffuse tensions in the community, the president said that in addition to the FBI, Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice have begun investigations into Brown's death. The president's statement on the tragic shooting follows Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson backtracking on his promise to name the officer who shot Brown - claiming he would be putting the man's life in danger if he did. According to witnesses, the officer is apparently white and opened fire on Brown while his hands were raised. The decision by Jackson to renege on his vow to name the officer by 2pm on Tuesday was met with heavy criticism by Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr. 'This person's got to pay for this,' said Brown Sr. 'If the name of the victim is released, how is the name of the perpetrator not released? We cannot in good conscience ask for toxicology tests of Mr. Brown without asking for it of the officer,' said Jamal Bryant, a pastor who appeared at a press conference with the Browns, their attorney Benjamin Crump, and the Reverend Al Sharpton today according to ABC News. Ferguson . Police Chief Tom Jackson said on Tuesday that he would not be releasing . the name of the police officer involved in the shooting of Michael . Brown. He said he hoped to at a later date when tensions had eased . Jackson said he decided not to name the officer after another of his staff was falsely named as the shooter. 'We've been getting death threats as a result to that officer. Officer safety is why we are not releasing the name (of the officer who shot Brown.) 'It's too volatile and dangerous. We think that the value of releasing his name is far outweighed by the safety at this point.' However, as Ferguson, St. Louis, faces another tense night, Michael Brown's parents urged the community and and civil rights leaders to appeal for calm and to cease rioting. 'I just want justice for my son. I really do. I need justice for my son,' said Michael Brown, Sr. to ABC News. 'I understand everybody has their own pains because they have losses too, but I need everyone to come together and do this the right way so we can get something done about this. No violence, man.'

The town of Ferguson has been on edge since Michael Brown, 18, and another teenager were confronted by an officer Saturday near Brown's apartment. Police say one of the teens shoved the officer back into his car and a struggle ensued. Brown was struck by several bullets after emerging from the car. Eyewitnesses have said Brown was raising his hands in surrender and that the officer kept firing. Authorities had said they would release the officer's name Tuesday but later decided not to, citing death threats against the officer. The FBI and St. Louis County police are conducting separate investigations. The shooting sparked two nights of unrest.

"Blackmail: David Cameron reportedly told German Chancellor Angela Merkel  Jean-Claude Juncker's appointment could lead to Britain's exit from the EU . David Cameron was accused of blackmail last night after warning Britain could quit the EU if an arch-federalist is appointed to head the European Commission. The Prime Minister voiced his opposition last week to the prospect of Jean-Claude Juncker being appointed to the role, warning it would enrage Eurosceptic voters across Europe. Yesterday it emerged that he had gone further in private, reportedly telling German Chancellor Angela Merkel it could lead to Britain’s departure from the EU. Mr Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, is a veteran enthusiast for the creation of a ‘United States of Europe’. Mr Cameron believes handing him the controls in Brussels would send a provocative message to the millions across Europe who voted for Eurosceptic parties in last month’s EU parliamentary elections. The respected German magazine Der Spiegel said that in private talks with Mrs Merkel, the Prime Minister  branded Mr Juncker a ‘face from the 1980s’ who ‘cannot solve the problems of the next five years’. He is said to have warned that the selection of Mr Juncker ‘would destabilise his government to such an extent that the referendum would have to be brought forward and will be likely to lead to the British voting no to EU membership’. Downing Street sources did not dispute Mr Cameron’s reported attack on Mr Juncker last night. However, one insisted he was making a broader statement about ‘stability in the EU’ rather than the UK Government. The source insisted there was no threat to bring forward the planned referendum on EU membership from 2017. Mrs Merkel with Mr Juncker: German magazine Der Spiegel said that in private talks with Mrs Merkel, Mr Cameron branded Mr Juncker a 'face from the 1980s' who 'cannot solve the problems of the next five years' Mr Cameron’s reported remarks angered Mr Juncker, who has the backing of the European People’s Party, the centre-right group in the European Parliament that includes Mrs Merkel’s MEPs. ■ Tony Blair will launch a staunch defence of the EU today, amid speculation that he will make a fresh bid to be president of Europe. The former prime minister will use a speech to the CBI in London to underline his pro-EU credentials – just days after private talks with German leader Angela Merkel in which he reportedly offered to tour Europe with the message ‘being in the EU is good for you’. However his office strenuously denied he is after the top job, saying that he ‘is not seeking any role’. Mr Juncker called on EU leaders not to bow to ‘minority’ pressure, telling Germany’s Bild am Sonntag newspaper: ‘Europe must not allow itself to be blackmailed.’ He said he was ‘optimistic about being chosen as the next commission president by mid-July’. British sources believe it may eventually be possible to persuade EU leaders to back a more reform-minded candidate, not least because France is also unenthusiastic about Mr Juncker. The post is one of the most powerful in Brussels as the commission has the power to draw up legislation, and will play a key role in Mr Cameron’s attempt to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith indicated yesterday that Mr Cameron could recommend leaving the EU if he fails to win substantial concessions from Brussels after the next election. He said: ‘The key thing is he knows very well that he can’t come back with nothing.’ Glamorous: Helle Thorning-Schmidt . Three women could be in the running for the most powerful job in Europe if David Cameron scuppers Jean-Claude Juncker’s bid. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, 47, the glamorous Danish prime minister, would be a strong candidate to become the European Commission’s first woman president. The former MEP is on the right of her party, the centre-left Social Democrats, and her rolling back of the Danish state has been viewed positively in Europe. Married to former Labour leader Neil Kinnock’s son Stephen, she would probably get Mr Cameron’s support. Also in the running is Christine Lagarde, 58, the French head of the International Monetary Fund, a conservative and friend of George Osborne. As a former finance minister to Nicolas Sarkozy, however, she is unlikely to win the backing of France’s socialist president Francois Hollande. An outside choice is Dalia Grybauskaite, 58, the president of Lithuania, who has served as an EU budget commissioner. Known as the ‘Steel Magnolia’, she has said she models herself on Margaret Thatcher. Write caption here .","PM has voiced opposition publicly to appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker .

"Hillary Clinton has mended fences with Barack Obama and 'looks forward to hugging it out' at a swanky party, according to her spokesman, just days after the publication of an interview in which she had harsh words for the president's handling of the crisis in Syria. Speaking last week to The Atlantic, the former secretary of state said Obama's 'failure' to arm rebels opposed to dictator Bashar al-Assad 'left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.' She was referring to the murderous terror group ISIS, which has left a swath of death and destruction in its wake as it plows through Iraq and claims to have established an Islamic caliphate. A Clinton spokesman, however, said Tuesday that she had 'called President Obama to make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him, his policies, or his leadership.' Awkward: Hillary wants to 'hug it out' with her former boss and mend fences agfter she publicly criticized his foreign policy . Not party attire: Mrs. Clinton was photographed in an unflattering muumuu on a beach in The Hamptons before leaving for a book signing on Martha's Vineyard, where the Obamas are vacationing . The statement, delivered first to Politico, acknowledged that Clinton and Obama have 'had honest differences on some issues, including aspects of the wicked challenge Syria presents.' But '[l]ike any two friends who have to deal with the public eye, she looks forward to hugging it out when she they see each other tomorrow night.' That could take the edge off of what would otherwise be an awkward encounter at a party Wednesday night on Martha's Vineyard. The event will honor Ann Jordan, wife of Democratic . adviser Vernon Jordan. Clinton, whose reputation as a calculating politician precedes her, is likely to be seen as a craftily playing both sides of the political fence. Distancing herself from an increasingly unpopular foreign policy will help her among moderates who have tired of a middle-path Obama White House that declines major engagements and, some argue, has given U.S. adversaries room to run. But publicly seeking reconciliation before a social gathering whose attendees have loose tongues and deep pockets and could simultaneously ingratiate her among far-left Democrats who are shopping for a candidate who will stay Obama's course for four or eight more years. Clinton's press flack emphasized on Tuesday that she shares Obama's 'deep commitment to a smart and principled foreign policy that uses all the tools at our disposal to achieve our goals.' The former diplomat is on the Massachusetts island for a book-signing session; the Obamas are in the midst . of a two-week vacation. It was unclear whether former President Bill Clinton also planned to attend the party. In her Atlantic interview, Clinton drew the sharpest distinctions . yet between herself and Obama in a rebuke of his cautious approach to global crises. 'Great nations need organizing principles, and ""don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle,' she said, referring to a version of the phrase Obama and his advisers . have used privately to describe his approach to foreign policy. Asked for her organizing principle, she replied: 'Peace, progress and prosperity. This worked for a very long time.' Clinton . wrapped her critiques in expressions of respect for the president and . sympathy for the tough global decisions he grapples with from the Oval . Office. On Monday, a . vacation day for Obama, he dealt with issues involving Iraq, Ukraine, . Gaza, Syria, as well as terrorism and Ebola in Africa. 'He's thoughtful, he's incredibly . smart, and able to analyze a lot of different factors that are all . moving at the same time,' she said. 'I . think he is cautious because he knows what he inherited, both the two . wars and the economic front, and he has expended a lot of capital and . energy trying to pull us out of the hole we're in.' However, . Clinton offered an uncompromising defense of Israel's battle against . Hamas in Gaza and argued against Obama's decision not to build up a . rebel fighting force to confront Syrian President Bashar Assad. President Barack Obama is currently on vacation on the island of Martha's Vineyard. On Wednesday he and Hillary Clinton will attend the same get-together just a few days after she slammed Obama's approach to Syria in an interview . Hillary Clinton signs copies of her book Hard choices in Huntington, New York last Wednesday. Clinton will be in Martha's Vineyard this week for another book signing . Clinton previously described her advocacy for the Syrian rebellion in her recently released book Hard Choices, a slow-selling memoir about her time leading the State Department. Obama has said supporting the rebels would not have stopped al-Qaida-inspired groups from rampaging across Syria and inside Iraq today. Clinton and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta reportedly argued for arming the rebels who first stood up to Assad three years ago. Since then, the question of 'arming the rebels' has become more complicated, as fighters linked to al-Qaeda and other fundamentalist Islamist groups have joined the rebellion. The White House declined to respond to Clinton's comments in The Atlantic, but said her team gave them a heads-up before the interview was published. Clinton, who lost to Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, has not said definitively whether she will run in 2016. But her decision to sit down for an in-depth interview about her foreign policy vision and to distinguish herself from the unpopular incumbent for whom she worked is the latest signal she's seriously preparing for a bid. Republicans say she won't be able to escape that she carried out Obama's foreign policy for his first term without public complaint. 'Hillary Clinton spent four years executing Barack Obama's foreign policy, and in year five of Obama's term it's ridiculous for Hillary to try to swindle voters into thinking what's happening around the world isn't a product of Obama-Hillary diplomacy,' Republican National Committee spokesperson Kirsten Kukowski said in response to Clinton's interview.","In an interview released over the weekend Clinton slammed Obama's 'don't do stupid stuff' approach to foreign policy .

"Priceless: Almost 500 years after he painted it, Leonardo da Vinci's portrait of noblewoman Isabella d'Este has been unearthed in a Swiss bank vault . For five centuries, it has been one of the art world’s greatest mysteries, with even its very existence in doubt. But now, almost 500 years after he painted it, a priceless Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece has been unearthed in a Swiss bank vault. In a story that seemed to come directly from the pages of a Dan Brown novel, the portrait of Italian noblewoman, Isabella d’Este, was discovered as part of a private collection in a Swiss bank. The Italian owners have decided to keep their identity a secret. The painting is a canvas and oil, finished rendering of a well-known pencil sketch of the same woman, the wife of the Marquess of Mantua and one of Renaissance Italy’s most influential women . The sketch, which was drawn in 1499, hangs in the Louvre, and is considered a forerunner to his most famous painting, the Mona Lisa. Isabella, who appears to share the world-famous subject's mysterious smile and rounded chin, wanted to be painted by the all the greatest artists of the day, which naturally included da Vinci. The preliminary sketch was greatly admired by the aristocratic lady’s friends so she asked him to finish the commission. But art historians had long been divided over whether the finished version of the commission existed. Da Vinci soon after begun one of his most compelling and large scale projects, The Battle of Anghiari, in Florence town hall. Then in 1503, he began the Mona Lisa. The painting is a canvas and oil, finished rendering of a well-known pencil sketch of d'Este (right). The sketch, which was drawn in 1499 and hangs in the Louvre, is considered a forerunner to da Vinci's (left) most famous painting, the Mona Lisa . Now experts believe that the striking portrait is indeed the work of the Italian genius. Professor Carlo Pedretti of the University of California, Los Angeles, the world’s leading expert in da Vinci told Italy’s Corriere della sera newspaper. 'There are no doubts that the portrait is the work of Leonardo. 'I can immediately recognise Da Vinci’s handiwork, particularly in the woman’s face.' Carbon dating has shown that there is a 95 per cent probability that the portrait was painted during the Renaissance period. And scientific tests have revealed that the primer used to treat the canvas is the same as that used by da Vinci . Further tests will make clear whether some of the lady’s accessories, including the gold crown, could have been painted by one of da Vinci’s assistants.","The oil portrait of Isabella d'Este had been missing for five centuries .

"It measures just two by four metres, has a wardrobe space of 30 centimetres squared and costs a tiny $15,000, but Rebecca Benson can't wait to move into her new home. The 22-year-old, along with her best friend Reece Brenan, hope to become the first Australians to complete construction of a moveable tiny house. The trend, which has kicked off across the United States, has more and more people choosing to dump their mortgages and cluttered lifestyle for simple living conditions. The best friends, from south Sydney in New South Wales, began construction on the miniature house for Rebecca one year ago, and plan to finish their Tiny Abode project by September. With a height of almost four metres, the house has all the basic features of a typical home, including a kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom - all in miniature proportions. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Benson (right) and Reece Brennan (left) are currently constructing Australia's first moveable tiny home, projected to be completed by September this year . The duo from south Sydney in New South Wales, have a 'three use' principle when designing and furnishing  - each object must have at least three uses to be accepted . The home has one and a half stories, measuring two metres wide, 3.6 metres long and 3.8 metres tall. It was built onto a custom made trailer making it completely mobile . It's all about smart design and functionality according to Reece, 23, who said every single object brought into the house was specifically chosen and thoroughly scrutinised. 'The key thing to have in mind is making sure that each and every way you utilise the space is as effective as possible and everything that you bring in - every piece of furniture and every object - has a very practical function. It's not just there for desirability but for necessity,' he said. 'If you think of functionality – a lounge can be folded up and have storage underneath. In a conventional home you wouldn't be utilising that space – it would be completely wasted and just be sitting there collecting dust.' Rebecca revealed the simple decision process behind all of their choices. 'We're using the three uses principle – if it doesn't have three uses then it shouldn't be in the house,' she said. 'So for example, a television – were not having one in the tiny abode.' 'A lot of houses in Australia, in fact the world - all the furniture is fixed towards a television. So it's been interesting designing a house without that being a centre point – it's complicated, but now everyone can just face each other.' The house has all the basic features of a typical home, including a kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom - all designed in miniature proportions in a functional and smart way . The rule means there is automatically no television in the house, according to Rebbeca, who said 'it's been interesting designing a house without that being a centre point' The duo are yet to release the exact cost price for their project, deciding to keep it a surprise for the finale. However Mr Brenan claims that a tiny home could be constructed for as little as $15,000. However, he admitted that this project will cost more due to it including 'features that are not entirely necessary' such as extra lights and hot water. 'But it would cost less than a deposit for a conventional one bedroom home', Reece said. One of the main reasons they are starting the project, is the duo's interest in exploring how they can reduce their footprint on the environment. 'Were both quite switched on to the idea that homes in Australia are way bigger than they need to be,' Reece said. 'We all love having this expansive space because we live in a country that does have so much space.' But according to Rebecca, the project is also about completing a good old-fashioned self-set challenge. 'I like the idea of designing my own home,' she said. 'I like being constrained and challenged and being able to live with less stuff. And I also like the idea of being able to move it!' The master bedroom in the smart home, sits in an open loft above the rest of the house, accessible by a ladder and big enough for a large mattress . The dining table easily folds away, while a couch will be able to open up to double as storage space. Rebecca admitted that her wardrobe space will be 30cm by 30cm . As the first attempt of a moveable miniature house in Australia, the duo  found themselves faced with an enormous dilemma when it came to research, forced to discern the legal requirements that vary across the states as well as from council to council. 'A lot of the American designs where wider than what you can have in Australia. They don't necessarily have strict road width rules because they have huge cars so some of the tiny homes were four metres wide in the US – that's not tiny at all,' Rebecca said. 'In Australia you can't make anything more than 2.5 metres or it's classified as a wide load. So we had to change our design to fit that. 'The law changes between states about width and height and then there's the double complexity of councils because some councils won't let you live in demountable buildings in their area. 'Our home is two metres wide by 3.6 metres long and 3.8 metres tall – the loft inside it makes is one and a half stories. So we have built it to Australian standards.' Reece revealed that Rebecca's home will cost over $15,000 due to including unnecessary features like extra lights, 'but it would cost less than a deposit for a conventional one bedroom home' The key to the design is to utilise each space as effectively as possible, according to Reece who said every object will only be included for  necessity, not desirability . Due to being the first moveable home, the duo were forced to trawl through legal requirements that differ between states and even councils, before construction . Other problems arose for Rebecca and Reece in trying to design the house to be an environmentally sustainable, off-grid home. 'The technology is just not available to Australia,' Rebecca said, describing how she was turned away time and time again by solar panel providers. 'It was like: ""I'm trying to give you lots of money to sell a product to me that I really want!"" but they just kept putting up road blocks. 'Hopefully in the future we'll try again, because [the house] is totally customisable and handmade.' Until then, the psychology student said she plans to freely travel around in her new home, which is attached to a customised trailer. 'I'm most looking forward to sharing it with others – I know it's a small place but we've had 10 people in it already,' she said. 'People are picturing this tiny box, but we have 11 windows – so it feels like a bigger space than it is –that was intentional in the design.'","Rebecca Benson's future home will measure two metres wide, 3.6 metres long and 3.8 metres tall on completion .

"BBC News channel editor Jasmine Lawrence was accused of showing 'bias' and 'prejudice' just hours before today's election by writing the critical tweet . A BBC News channel boss claimed yesterday that Ukip stands up for white, middle class men with ‘sexist’ and ‘racist’ views. Jasmine Lawrence was accused of showing bias and prejudice just hours before today’s election by posting the message on Twitter. Mrs Lawrence had been due to help lead BBC News coverage of today’s local and European elections, but the corporation last night said she had been removed from that role as it launched an internal investigation. She has deactivated her Twitter account. The 43-year-old wrote the tweet after Ukip encouraged its supporters to share reasons why they were voting for the party, with the hashtag #WhyImVotingUkip. Mrs Lawrence, who is an editor on the rolling news channel and was duty editor for the 2010 general election, posted: ‘#WhyImVotingUkip – to stand up for white, middle class, middle aged men w sexist/racist views, totally under represented in politics today.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage told the Mail: ‘For this senior figure in the BBC to show such prejudice when she works for the public service broadcaster is astonishing. If the BBC are serious about challenging bias she should be fired immediately.’ A BBC spokesman said: 'Jasmine Lawrence was tweeting from a personal account. She has been reminded of her responsibilities to uphold BBC guidelines. She has deactivated her Twitter account and will now be playing now part in the BBC's election coverage in coming days.' Mrs Lawrence, who lives with her husband in a £475,000 house in Henley-upon-Thames, joined the BBC in 2001 and has held a number of roles within the corporation including running its Westminster desk. In 2011 she joined a BBC team responsible for posting breaking news on Twitter before she was promoted to become an assistant editor on the BBC News channel in 2012. On her LinkedIn profile, Mrs Lawrence, who has a private pilot’s licence, boasted: ‘I've been a journalist for 25 years with proven experience in both the commercial sector and within the BBC. ‘I am well versed in making decisions - frequently at speed. I have impeccable editorial judgment.’ She tweeted: posted: '#WhyImVotingUkip - to stand up for white, middle class, middle aged men w sexist/racist views, totally under represented in politics today' 'We voted Miliband. He edged it on comedy value' Mrs Lawrence added: ‘The BBC is facing tough challenges ahead. We have to offer audiences something they don't get elsewhere, whether it’s original stories, creative treatments, more thorough analysis, or ideally all of the above. ‘Put bluntly, we can't justify the licence fee if we simply give audiences the same stories and same approach they find elsewhere. We need to be at our best when the audiences (new or otherwise) turn to us.’ The hashtag #whyimvotingukip started trending yesterday morning after the party posted on Twitter: ‘Why are you voting UKIP this year? Tell us, tell Twitter and let’s get it trending! #WhyImVotingUkip.’ Nigel Farage wrote on Twitter: ‘Delighted to see so many people announcing their intention to vote for UKIP tomorrow #WhyImVotingUKIP.’ But it was quickly ambushed by opponents of the party who posted sarcastic messages about the party and Mr Farage with the hashtag. Joke responses including: ‘#WhyImVotingUkip: because, like the leader @Nigel_Farage, I get a bit racist when I’m tired too.’ Another user posted: ‘#WhyImVotingUkip because voting far right and blaming minorities after an economic downturn worked so well before, let’s try that again.’ Mrs Lawrence last night deleted her Twitter account. Ukip leader Nigel Farage once bragged about the number of women he had got pregnant and attacked the ‘lunacy’ of maternity leave in an interview that emerged yesterday. Asked if women should play football, Mr Farage told a Belgian magazine: ‘Here’s the bigger question. Do we think, chaps, when we’re there in the front line, when the balloon goes up, with fixed bayonets, when the whistle’s about to blow to go over the top, do we actually want to be there with women beside us? 'Do we? What an extraordinarily bizarre idea! I certainly don’t think so.' He added: ‘But maybe it’s because I’ve got so many women pregnant over the years that I have a different view. ‘I find it very difficult to think that we could stand up and run over the top together, into the machine guns or whatever. Men and women are different - thank God!’ Mr Farage, who has had four children with two wives, made the remarks in an interview with magazine Up Front in 2005. He added that it was ‘lunacy’ that ‘if you have children you get three months paid leave off work, or six months paid leave off work’. The emergence of the interview came as Farage said that hostility towards him now means that his own aunt now denies that they are related. He told the Spectator: ‘My dear old auntie, who is in her eighties, and lives just down the road, is asked when she goes to the shops, “Oh, are you any relation?” She says no. It’s safer!’","Jasmine Lawrence, 43, was accused of 'bias' and 'prejudice' against Ukip .

The four-year-old sisters, who in 2009 became the first double set of identical twins to be born in Britain thanks to IVF, couldn’t wait to try on their outfits – and now they are eagerly counting down to the start of term. Their mother Lisa, 38, from Billingham in County Durham, said: ‘Seeing them in uniforms makes them seem so grown up. I know I will shed a tear when I wave them off on their first day.’ She added: ‘Some children might be nervous starting school. But when you’re quads you’ve always got someone to lean on. You’re never on your own.’ The mum of five, who with husband Sean, 39,  an electrical designer,  also has older son Cameron, 13, admits teachers might have a difficult time telling the girls apart. She says: ‘The girls went to the nursery attached to the school so they are known to many of the staff. 'But to help teachers who don’t know them, I plan to put hair ties with different coloured bobbles in the girls’ hair – with blue for twins Jessica and Hannah and red for twins Heidi and Annabelle.’ Lisa Kelly, pictured here with the quads when they were five days old, plans to put hair ties with different coloured bobbles in the girls' hair - blue for twins Jessica and Hannah and red for twins Heidi and Annabelle . However, Mrs Kelly says her daughters have all developed their own style and while initially people are confused they soon realise each one is very much an individual. ‘Heidi is a real tomboy,’ she says, ‘but Annabelle is a true girl who adores her dollies, Jessica is a live wire who’s always up to mischief while Hannah is much quieter.’ Each set of twins shares a bedroom at the couple’s four bed-detached house in Billingham, Cleveland. But says Mrs Kelly: 'They are so close that even now they still adore to snuggle up together and we always find they’ve crept into one another’s beds in the morning.’ The 10-million-to-one were born on December 2009 after Lisa and her husband Sean spent £9,000 on IVF. Pictured left to right: Heidi, Annabelle, Hannah and Jessica . The youngsters created a sensation when they were born on December 27, 2009. The 10 million to one quads were the first born in Britain who are two sets of identical twins. They are the miracle children the Kellys never thought they’d have. Originally the couple simply wanted a sibling for their son Cameron. But after failing to conceive naturally a second time they spent £9,000 on IVF and to their delight found they were expecting quads after the third attempt. The girls, pictured here shortly before their second birthday, might look identical but their mother said they have all developed their own individual style and personalities . The girls – the result of two fertilised embryos put back into the uterus that both grew into two sets of identical twins – were born healthy at 31.5 weeks after a problem free pregnancy. Twins Heidi and Annabelle both weighed 3Ib 3oz while Hannah and Jessica were 2Ib 10oz and 2Ib 11oz . Recalls Mrs Kelly, who took a career break to raise her family but plans to return to work as a nurse in the autumn: ‘Overnight our lives changed and for a while it was chaos. 'We went through two washing machines and tumble dryers in two years and ended up doing what used to be a family grocery shop once a week, every other day. ‘As they’ve grown up everything has had to be done in fours. Four sets of clothes, four matching toy pushchairs, four identical scooters – Christmas and birthdays take lots of planning. ‘But we’ve always felt extraordinarily lucky to have a big family. Even now the girls still attract attention - people still stop us when we’re out say how beautiful they are.’ Meanwhile she believes having the four together is a blessing. ‘When they were tiny babies and then wilful toddlers life was tiring but now they’re older they get on so well and there is always someone to play with. ‘Some children might be nervous starting full time school for the first time. But when you’re one of quads you’ve always got someone to lean on. You’re never on your own.’","The four sisters became Britain's first double set of identical twins in 2009 .

"In front of a stadium of screaming crowds, three Beluga whales dance, wave and high-five. It seems like innocent entertainment, attracting thousands to Changfeng Ocean World in Shanghai every day. But today, the company that owns the park and dozens of others worldwide, including Alton Towers, has been accused of animal cruelty and ‘double standards’. Scroll down for video . Criticism: Merlin Entertainments has come under fire after footage has emerged of three Beluga whales, Junjun, Uka 1 and Uka 2, performing at the firm's Shanghai aquarium, Changfeng Ocean World . Performance: Three Beluga whales performing at Changfeng Ocean World in Shanghai last August . Merlin Entertainments, which owns 44 SeaLife aquaria across the globe, claims to be leading the fight to free Beluga whales and dolphins from captivity, and makes no mention of their performing trio – Junjun, Uka 1 and Uka 2 – on their British websites. Its websites state: 'Sea Life believes it is wrong to keep whales and dolphins in captivity. No matter how spacious, no captive facility can ever provide such far-ranging, highly social and highly intelligent animals with the stimulation they need for a good quality of life.' However, the Captive Animals' Protection Society (CAPS), an international animal rights organisation, has today accused the firm of hypocrisy, releasing footage of Junjun, Uka 1, and Uka 2 entertaining crowds on March 3, 2014 – two years after Merlin purchased the park in March 2012. Junjun, Uka 1, and Uka 2 perform to an audience of 2,000 three times a day. Born in the wild, they were captured and taken to China around five years ago. Uka 1 and Uka 2 were and transferred to the park in eastern China in 2011, where Junjun had already been for at least a year. Merlin claims the performances at Changfeng have been altered to only involve natural movements as they look for a Beluga whale sanctuary. The firm bought the Shanghai aquarium in 2012 . With a high-pitched twitter, and bright white skin, Beluga whales have been hunted for centuries. Unlike many marine animals, they can swim backwards, but do not jump out of the water like dolphins and killer whales. They have an acute sense of hearing that makes them more sensitive to human noise pollution than most other whales. Scientists have found their hearing is the same both in and out of the water. A spokesman for Merlin claims the past two years have been spent finding a natural sanctuary for Junjun and the two Ukas. In the meantime, the spokesman added, their routine has been altered to reflect their natural behaviour. Blasting the performances as ‘unnatural’, a spokesman for CAPS has accused Merlin of ‘wasting time’. Captivity: The highly sensitive animals were born in the wild, captured and taken to China where they now perform in a 2,000-capacity stadium three times a day . Director of CAPS Liz Tyson, who is campaigning to return the Belugas to the wild, said: 'Sea Life claims to be opposed to the keeping of highly intelligent and sentient animals, like dolphins and whales, in captivity and yet forces Beluga whales to perform demeaning tricks for screaming crowds every day in its overseas operation. 'Whilst it is clearly within the animals' abilities to be able to do these things, it is very different to this being a demonstration of natural behaviour. Whales do not dance, wave or sing to crowds of thousands of screaming people.' The controversy will come as an embarrassment for the global corporation just months after it successfully petitioned to block US rival SeaWorld from importing Russian Beluga whales from the wild to perform. 'Sea Life claims to . be opposed to the keeping of highly intelligent and sentient animals, . like dolphins and whales, in captivity and yet forces Beluga whales to . perform demeaning tricks for screaming crowds every day in its overseas . operation' - Captive Animals' Protection Society director Liz Tyson . Marine biologist Margaux Dodds, of UK charity Marine Connection, said: 'We fail to see why a large commercial organisation such as SeaLife, owned by Merlin, is taking so long to establish a sanctuary. 'Whilst we appreciate this must be . carried out with the utmost care for the welfare of any animals . involved, there have been cases of release of captive whales and . dolphins in the past which have been achieved fairly quickly with a very . tight budget.' A spokesman for Merlin Entertainments defended the set up as a situation they have been working to rectify. The firm is working with the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society lobbying Europe to ban dolphinariums. The spokesman said: 'Since 2012 we have been exhaustively exploring all possible options for these whales, with their long term welfare the highest priority. 'We have spared no energy in pursuit of a solution, and we believe that we are very close to finding an excellent new home for them. 'In the meantime however we have invested in improving their existing environment - something we did the moment we took over – and in changing the nature of shows so that they only reflect the natural behaviours of the animals – no tricks.' She added that a potential site for a dolphin sanctuary to house their bottle-nose dolphins in Europe has been found: 'At present we are wholly focused on progressing the sanctuary project and would obviously only undertake the necessary suitability assessment on these three animals once it was established that work on a Sanctuary could commence and a likely ""date of readiness"" established. 'We are happy that the arrangements made for them in the interim, are the best we could have made, in respect of their health and general well-being.' Delicacy: In the 19th century, demand surged for the skin of Beluga whales to be used for leather . Bright white, with a vast range of vocal tones, Beluga whales have been hunted for centuries for zoos. Served as a delicacy in many Asian countries, they are also illegally fished for their meat.In the 19th century, demand surged for their skin to be used for leather. Known as ‘the canary of the sea’, they have a high-pitched twitter and can produce 11 other types of sound, including cackling and whistling. They are born dark grey but by the age of five turn bright white. On average, they will live for 25-30 years and reach 18ft long, 1,600kg. They feed on fish and crustaceans. The highly sociable animals form small groups of around 10 males and females, led by an alpha male. They spend the winter months around the arctic cap, and in the summer migrate to river estuaries in countries such as North America, Greenland and Northern China. Mating starts at between four and nine years old. Female belugas give birth to one calf every three years on average. Gestation last 12 months. Beautiful: A Beluga whale appears on the surface of the water of the Arctic Sea in the brief summer months . Unlike many cetaceans, they can swim backwards, but they do not jump out of the water like dolphins or killer whales. The population of just 150,000 worldwide is spread across the arctic regions of the northern hemisphere – northern Alaska, Canada, Greenland, the north coast of Russia, and the upper regions of Japan and China. Belugas bodies are wrapped in a thick layer of blubber to protect them from the freezing temperatures. And they use their highly-developed sonar system to navigate the shallow waters and avoid icebergs. They were one of the first whale species to be kept in captivity – the first captured beluga was recorded in 1861 in Barnum’s Museum, New York. Since 1973, international whale-hunting laws have sought to control the trade of Belugas. Now, only certain Inuit tribes are permitted to hunt the gentle cetaceans. However, in 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature listed the species as ‘near threatened’, as the demand for the species in zoos and restaurants continues to surge. In Alaska, the population is considered ‘critically endangered’.","SeaLife owner Merlin Entertainments helps lobbying to ban dolphinariums .

"Cracked: Jonathan Corbett's video shows how he smuggled a metal case through scanners at two airports . Controversial nude body scanners used at U.S. airports have come under fire again - after a blogger claimed he could easily smuggle explosives through them onto a plane. Engineer Jonathan Corbett has published a video where he shows how he took a small metal case through two of the TSA's $1billion fleet in a special side pocket stitched into his shirt. This is because, he suggests, the scanners blend metallic areas into the dark background - so if an object is not directly placed on the body, it will not show up on the scan. The metallic box, he claims, would have set off an alarm had he passed through the old detecting system. His revelation comes just weeks after Europe banned the 'airport strip-searches' over fears the X-ray technology could cause cancer. MailOnline has decided not to publish the video because it details exactly how to circumvent the safety procedure - but it is freely available to watch online. Corbett, standing in his living room as he speaks to the camera in the video for his 'TSA Out of Our Pants' blog, acknowledges the technique could be used by terrorists. But he believes they would already know . about the loophole, and took the steps to show 'how much danger the . Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is putting all us all in'. Usual: In this TSA scan the metal items, located on the traveller's body, can clearly be seen as the body appears against a black background . Contrast: In this image, the metallic object is not directly placed on the body and so does not show up on the scan as it blends into the background . Europe banned the controversial airport 'strip-search' scanners last year over fears the X-ray technology could cause cancer. They emit low radiation doses and the European Union told members in November not to install them until the potential risks are assessed. The TSA, in contrast, has continually defended their safety, saying they expose passengers to the same radiation as two minutes on a flying plane. Britain's Manchester Airport, which has 16 of the $125,000 'backscatter' machines, was told it can continue using them for another year. But no new machines will be allowed there. They were once used at London Heathrow but scrapped amid complaints over privacy invasion. They have also been tested in Germany, France, Italy, Finland and Holland but will be completely banned in April if experts rule they are dangerous. The body scanners were introduced in a security crackdown after incidents such as the attempted 'underwear bomb' plot in 2009. Around 250 X-ray scanners and 264-millimetre-wave scanners are currently used in America’s airports. Corbett, who is suing the TSA for rolling out the scanners, explained how the loophole worked. He said: 'Here are several images produced by TSA nude body scanners. You'll see that the search victim is drawn with light colours and placed on a black background in both images. 'In these samples, the individuals are concealing metallic objects that you can see as a black shape on their light figure.  Again that’s light figure, black background, and black threat items. 'Yes that’s right, if you have a metallic object on your side, it will be the same colour as the background and therefore completely invisible to both visual and automated inspection. 'It can’t possibly be that easy to beat the TSA’s billion dollar fleet of nude body scanners, right? The TSA can’t be that stupid, can they? Unfortunately, they can, and they are.' He said he put his theory to the test by buying a sewing kit to sew a pocket directly onto the side of his shirt. He then took a metallic case and walked through a backscatter X-ray at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport - all of which he recorded on film. He said: 'While I’m not about to win any videography awards for my hidden camera footage, you can watch as I walk through the security line with the metal object in my new side pocket. 'My camera gets placed on the conveyor belt and goes through its own x-ray, and when it comes out, I’m through, and the object never left my pocket. 'Maybe a fluke? OK, let’s try again at Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport through one of the TSA’s newest machines: a millimetre wave scanner with automated threat detection built-in. 'With the metallic object in my side . pocket, I enter the security line, my device goes through its own x-ray, . I pass through, and exit with the object without any complaints from . the TSA.' He added: 'While I . carried the metal case empty, it could easily have been filled with . razor blades, explosives, or one of Charlie Sheen’s infamous seven gram . rocks of cocaine. 'With a bigger pocket, perhaps sewn on the inside of the shirt, even a firearm could get through. ' Controversial: A demonstration of the scanners that European bosses have failed to give the green light for. A full body scan is shown, left, and a screen showing the results of the scan, right . American use: More than 600 Advanced Imaging Technology units, using X-ray technology, have been installed at 140 airports across the U.S . While Corbett's actions have not been independently verified, and the TSA have not commented on the video, he said it proved the organisation's 'disregard for safety'. He added: 'Now, I’m sure the TSA will accuse me of aiding the terrorists by releasing this video, but it’s beyond belief that the terrorists haven’t already figured this out and are already plotting to use this against us. 'It’s also beyond belief that the TSA did not already know everything I just told you, and arrogantly decided to disregard our safety. The nude body scanner program is nothing but a giant fraud.'","Jonathan Corbett claims he could easily smuggle explosives onto a plane .

"The names and photos of Australian MH17 plane crash victims are being exploited by online scammers who have set up fake Facebook tribute pages to drive traffic to a dodgy external website. The Facebook pages, created on the day the plane crashed, baited people to click on another website with a link purporting to show footage of the MH17 disaster. 'Video Camera Caught the moment plane MH17 Crash over Ukraine.Watch here the video of Crash,' the link read. Scroll down for video . Scammers have created fake Facebook accounts for MH17 victims, including the three young Perth children who died with their grandfather . Victims targeted by the scam include young Perth siblings Otis, Evie and Mo Maslin, Canberra woman Liliane Derden and Fatima Dyczynski, who was born in Germany but was on flight MH17 because she was moving to Perth. The scam also exploited the names of victims from other countries, including Quinn Lucas Schansman from the US, British-born Kiwi Rob Ayley, Malaysia Airlines pilot Eugene Choo Jin Leong  and Richard Mayne, Ben Pocock and Liam Sweeney from the UK. Facebook has taken down the pages but the external site goalshighlights.com remains live. It was registered in Bucharest, Romania in 2010 and the ISP address tracks back to the Netherlands. Ken Gamble, chairman of the Australian chapter of the International Association of Cybercrime Prevention, said it looked like the website had been hacked in order to divert to adult hook up websites and others selling counterfeit drugs. Online fraud experts said the pages were in poor taste but would only be forcibly removed by Facebook if they were criminal . 'I've seen this quite a lot, hackers get in, take control of a site and they then divert to a stack of stuff and use the bandwidth of this guy's website sometimes for illegal purpose sometimes or for getting the hits up on certain sites,' Mr Gamble said. He added that the websites that goalshighlights.com diverted to contained malicious files that would infect a user's computer if clicked on. Canberra mother-of-two Liliane Derden was one of the victims targeted by the scam . Mr Gamble added that fraudsters often capitalised on disasters like the MH17 crash. 'When a disaster like this happens it's a great opportunity for all sorts of scammers,' Mr Gamble told Daily Mail Australia. 'Everybody is out there looking for information at the moment, everyone wants to know more about what's happened. 'It's a great opportunity to prey on people's vulnerabilities and emotion is the greatest one.' Scammers aim to lure a portion of the high amount of internet traffic going to websites with MH17 information, Mr Gamble said. 'Some people will be using it for an opportunity to market their sites, it's a good way to bring a massive amount of traffic to someone's site,' he said. 'Other offenders will be doing this for more sinister purposes.' Before the Facebook pages were removed users expressed outrage, labelling them 'disgusting' and the person who created them a 'sicko'. Others reported the pages to Facebook as spam in the hope of getting them taken down. But some Facebook users did not realise the pages were fake, posting heartfelt messages to the page. 'Incredible, terrible...To lose your kids in this way...Such beautiful lovely children...no words...' one person wrote on the page of Mo Maslin. 'We pray for all the Australian people, especially the children god will take care of them in his safe hands let the stars shine bright for u so u know that ur not alone,' another person posted. A spokesman for Facebook said: 'We are disabling these profiles as soon as we are made aware of them. 'We encourage people to block those responsible and report suspicious behaviour to our team of experts via our reporting buttons so that we can quickly take the appropriate action.'","Names and photos of Australian MH17 plane crash victims exploited online .

"Letters from the IRS to tea party-related organizations in Oklahoma City and Albuquerque, New Mexico show that IRS headquarters in Washington, D.C., and two satellite offices in California, were directly involved with sending harassing letters to conservative organizations that sought tax-exempt status. The IRS has acknowledged only the involvement of its Exempt Organizations office in Cincinnati, Ohio, which typically makes most decisions about granting or denying tax-exempt status to non-profit organizations. And Wednesday afternoon, CNN cited a congressional source in reporting that the acting IRS Commissioner – whom President Obama fired later in the day – had identified two 'rogue' employees, both in Cincinnati, whom he thought were responsible for targeting right-wing organizations with tactics that were not applied to left-wing or non-political groups. This letterhead from the IRS headquarters in Washington, DC, accompanied a probing letter directed at a tea party group. The IRS Inspector General investigated only similar communications from the agency's Cincinnati office . Jay Sekulow (L) says his American Center for Law and Justice will sue the IRS if it doesn't grant tax-exempt status to 27 tea party groups by Friday. Lois Lerner (R) is a civil servant, not a political appointee, heads the IRS office the handles tax-exempt groups . Steven Miller then the acting IRS Commissioner, described the two employees as being 'off the reservation,' according to the CNN source. Miller, added CNN, had emphasized that the problem was not confined to just two staffers. Tuesday's report from the IRS Office of Inspector General, however, focused exclusively on the Cincinnati office. This IG's review, according to the report 'was performed at the EO [Exempt Organizations] function Headquarters office in Washington, D.C., and the Determinations Unit in Cincinnati, Ohio.' The Washington staffers involved, the IG report continues, were in charge of reviewing materials prepared in Cincinnati. 'As part of this effort, EO function Headquarters office employees reviewed the additional information request letters prepared by the team of [Cincinnati] specialists,' the report reads. IRS offices in the California towns of El Monte and Laguna Niguel sent politically motivated letters to tea party groups, suggesting that the problem reached beyond the Cincinnati office where the IG report focused . One letter, sent to a northern California organization, demanded to know about its links with the Redding (Calif.) Tea Party Patriots. 'Tea party' was one phrase that reportedly triggered a 'Be On The Lookout' notice among IRS employees looking for politically conservative applicants for tax-exempt statuses . Nothing in the report describes letters sent by IRS employees in California or the District of Columbia. Yet an April 21, 2010 letter to the Albuquerque Tea Party organization, containing a preliminary list of 10 questions, came from the IRS's Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division in Washington, D.C. The group responded on June 10. Seventeen months passed before the IRS responded on November 16, 2011. That letter, similar in scope and tone to other intrusive IRS letters that have drawn national attention, also came from the Washington, D.C. IRS office. It included an additional 28 questions. A separate letter came to Patriots Educating Concerned Americans Now (PECAN), a Redding, California conservative group, from an IRS office in the Orange County, California town of Laguna Niguel. That letter, dated January 31, 2012, asked 55 questions, including a demand for 'complete copies of the organization's website that is accessible to members only.' It also asked a series of pointed questions about PECAN's relationship to the Redding Tea Party Patriots, an overtly political organization. Under mounting pressure, President Barack Obama announced Wednesday in the East ROom of the White House that acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller would be stepping down . Steven Miller, shown here in a CBS report, is the highest-profile official to resign under pressure from the Obama administration. Miller informed IRS employees in a face-saving email that he would be leaving weeks from now, 'as my acting assignment ends in early June' A third IRS letter to a group called Oklahoma City Patriots In Action, or the OKC PIA Association, came from an IRS office in El Monte, California, an eastern suburb of Los Angeles, on February 9, 2012. It included 59 questions, including a demand for a list showing the time, date, place and 'content schedule' for every 'public rally or exhibition' the group had ever conducted.'for or against any public policies, legislations [sic], public officers, political candidates, or like kinds.' 'Please state whether you provide any advocacy training to your members and to the general public,' another question read. 'If yes, describe in detail your advocacy training and provide copies of any publications concerning such training.' The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), which represents all three groups, provided MailOnline with a letter from the IRS in Washington, D.C. in which the agency said it still had not decided whether to award the Albuquerque Tea Party tax-exempt status. That letter was dated April 16, 2013, more than three years since the group filed its initial application. Jay Sekulow, the ACLJ's chief counsel, scoffed at the idea of the IRS scapegoating a pair of its Cincinnati employees, given the letters he has seen from offices three time zones apart. The Tea Party Patriots and other conservative groups provided a powerful rallying force during the 2010 midterm elections. It was around the same time that the Obama administration's IRS began targeting such groups that applied for tax-exempt nonprofit status . Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. George Russell (L) will testify alongside the now-former acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller before the House Ways and Means Committee on May 17. Also shown is IRS Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement Linda Stiff . 'The IRS's assertion that this scheme was launched by a couple of rogue employees in the Cincinnati office is absurd,' Sekulow said. His organization represents 27 tea party organizations, all of which were targeted, he said, with partisan attacks. 'To suggest that a couple of low-level employees decided to launch this unprecedented conduct of intimidation does not square with the facts,' he added. Sekulow said his group plans to sue the IRS if it has not granted all 27 groups their tax-exempt statuses by Friday. 'The action and conduct of the IRS is not only intolerable and unconscionable, it is actionable. We continue to move forward with our plans to file a federal lawsuit which could come as early as next week."" Sekulow showed MailOnline an IRS . letter to his group's tea party client in Wetumpka, Alabama. That letter, which . did originate in Cincinnati, was similar to the Washington, D.C. and California letters, and identical in some places. The similarities suggest a program of national scope, tied together with standardized texts and applied from IRS offices nationwide. If that's the case, the IRS's explanations to date will be left wanting. Former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman testified last year that there was no program in his agency targeting conservative political groups for special screening before tax-exempt status was conferred. That testimony proved false . Rain or shine: Tea party stalwarts were known for stubbornly supporting a strict reading of the U.S. Constitution, and for getting under the skin of political liberals. News that the IRS, under the Obama administration, singled them out for special screening, may energize them into another potent force in time for the 2014 election . A timeline included in the Inspector General's report describes the agency's attempt to retrain its employees after the politically partisan program was discovered. 'Training was held in Cincinnati, Ohio, on how to process identified potential political cases,' one timeline entry reads. Two days later, according to the same timeline, an IRS team 'began reviewing all potential political cases began [sic] in Cincinnati, Ohio.' The report describes nothing about remedial action taken anywhere else. MailOnline asked an IRS spokeswoman to comment on whether the IRS or the Office of Inspector General interviewed employees in its California offices as part of preparing the report released Tuesday. MailOnline also asked if the Inspector General's office questioned anyone who worked in the Washington, D.C. headquarters, including political appointees. The IRS had no response, despite providing a specific email address for those questions during a phone call. In March 2012, Douglas Shulman, then the IRS Commissioner, testified before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight that the tax agency did not investigate organizations differently according to their political ideologies. 'As you know, we pride ourselves in being non-political, non-partisan organization,' Shulman said then. 'There is absolutely no political targeting.' This chart, from the IRS Inspector General's report, shows the pecking order at the IRS among people who handle tax-exempt organizations. Lois Lerner is represented by the small box at center reading 'Director, EO.' Employees above her pay grade include some political appointees. At the top is Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement Linda Stiff, shown above in red . Lois G. Lerner, the woman who leads the IRS division that evaluates and monitors tax-exempt organizations, learned in June 2011 - nine months earlier - that this was not true, according to the Inspector General's report. Given that letters originated in Washington, Cincinnati and southern California, and may have come from other IRS offices as well, it will become a greater challenge for Shulman to explain why he was mistaken when he testified on Capitol Hill last year. Both Lerner and Shulman will testify in a house Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on May 22. 'The IG report indicts IRS for a colossal management failure, but leaves many questions unanswered,' said California Rep. Darrel Issa, who chairs that committee, in a statement. In a separate hearing on May 17, the House Ways and Means Committee will hear testimony from Steven Miller – now the former Acting IRS Commissioner – and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George. 'The IRS absolutely must be non-partisan in its enforcement of our tax laws,' said Michigan Republican Rep. Dave Camp, who chairs that committee, in a statement. 'The admission by the agency that it targeted American taxpayers based on politics is both shocking and disappointing. ... We will hold the IRS accountable for its actions.' Obama announced Miller's departure during a brief dinnertime announcement before news cameras in the East Room of the White House. The IRS, the president conceded, 'improperly screened conservative groups.' Referring to the Inspector General's report, Obama said 'the misconduct that it uncovered is inexcusable. It's inexcusable and Americans are right to be angry about it. And I am angry about it.'","Tax agency has admitted targeting tea .

"Getting stuck behind - or worse, crashing into - a slow-strolling pedestrian who is engrossed in their cellphone is one of the great frustrations of navigating any metropolis in a hurry. With that in mind, National Geographic has introduced separate lanes for cellphone and non-cellphone using pedestrians, at a busy block on Washington DC's 18th Street. It's part of a social experiment for the channel's new Mind Over Masses science series, which 'uses what we know about human behavior' to develop 'interactive solutions to everyday problems.' Human traffic: As part of National Geographic's Mind Over Masses TV show, a sidewalk was split into two sections; one for cellphone users and the other for those not using a cellphone, in downtown Washington . National Geographic Channel spokesman Chad Sandhas acknowledged the channel was behind the temporary signage and said pedestrians' reactions were being filmed for Mind Over Masses. But he declined to discuss details of the experiment during the filming, which he said would continue today. According to a notice on the website of . Washington's Office of Motion Picture and Television Development, which . issued the film permit, the show planned to create 'fast and slow lanes' on the sidewalk, 'allowing participants to choose.' Will it work? The stunt is part of a social experiment, which 'uses what we know about human behavior' to develop 'interactive solutions to everyday problems' Total rebel: Either this man disapproved of the pedestrian lanes concept, or, ironically, was too busy looking at his phone to see the signs . On Thursday afternoon, many pedestrians seemed to ignore the markings, though there were some who took pictures of the novel signage. Another mystery aspect of the experiment involved someone wearing a gorilla suit eating a banana, which also drew attention from passers-by. Irene Fadakar, 54, a secretary who was walking past the spectacle, said she noticed the markings at the beginning of the sidewalk. But she acknowledged that less than a block later she was back on her phone, walking in the lane marked 'no cellphones.' Ongoing: A National Geographic Channel spokesman acknowledged the channel was behind the temporary signage, but spokesman Chad Sandhas declined to discuss further details of the continuing experiment .",The lanes were marked onto a busy Washington DC sidewalk as part of National Geographic's new Mind Over Masses series .

"BBC wildlife expert Chris Packham (above) has warned humans need to help wildlife instead of 'chasing cures for cancer' BBC wildlife expert Chris Packham has warned humans need to stop prioritising themselves over the environment and help wildlife instead of ‘chasing cures for cancer’. The Springwatch co-host and outspoken naturalist also declared economic growth is a ‘recipe for disaster’ and blamed Christianity for allowing humans to think that they can exploit the planet’s resources. The 53-year-old enjoyed a childhood that fuelled his love of nature from making camps in the woods to starting fires and catching grass snakes. However they are pleasures he said he rarely witnesses children enjoying these days and Packham said he fears it is because parents are afraid their offspring may get hurt. He declared ‘risk aversion is killing childhood’ and added children enjoying nature on their own are now ‘extinct’. It is not the first time that Packham has urged for the environment to be given greater priority. Several years ago he warned the only way to protect the future of the planet is to curb population growth and suggested offering Britons tax breaks to encourage them to have smaller families. Packham made his latest wide-ranging and controversial comments in a joint interview with his Springwatch co-host Bill Oddie, 72, for the Radio Times to mark the tenth birthday of the popular programme which returns to screens next week. Asked what he thought the future holds for the environment, Packham said: ‘We’ve got to get to a state where we think about all life and not just human life. 'Christianity doesn’t help: we’re made in God’s image so everything is there to be exploited by us. It doesn’t help people’s attitudes. But I’m optimistic. We’re developing technologies and skills, and our understanding of what we need to do to preserve species is increasing. ‘The reason why it’s failing at the moment is that politicians – local, national, global – don’t understand the need to look after our planet. Martin Hughes-Games (left), Chris Packham (centre) and Michaela Strachan (right) return to screens next week as Springwatch returns for its tenth birthday . ‘Biological resources are worth trillions of dollars a year, when you think about the fish taken out of the sea, the forests cut down for wood, ‘the oil pumped out of the ground. 'So, at a certain point the ecologists will have an equal say to the economists. If there’s one mantra that we need to break in the next ten years it’s that economic growth is a good thing. It isn’t. It’s a recipe for global disaster.’ Warming to his theme, Packham criticised Sir Richard Branson’s 'grotesquely misinformed''project to put lemurs on a Caribbean island when they should be in Madagascar, but called on wealthy philanthropists to stop funding health charities and look to plough cash into environmental causes instead. He said: ‘What we need in the next 10 years - as a stop-gap - is corporate funding and the benevolence of philanthropists. Springwatch is set to return to screens next week and Bill Oddie, 72, (above) will appear as a special guest . 'There are a lot of wealthy people in the UK who, in the past, would give to things such as medicine and education, but because of the pressure on the environment they’re now thinking of using their excess wealth to protect wildlife. 'We need to stop chasing cures for cancer and things like that and start realising that the health of the planet goes beyond the health of human beings.' However, . Sara Osborne, Cancer Research UK’s head of policy, said investment into . research which could find life-saving cures and treatments for cancer . remained vital. She . said: 'More than 300,000 people are diagnosed with cancer in the UK . each year but thanks to research into life-saving treatments and cures, . 50 per cent now survive for at least 10 years, compared to just a . quarter in the 1970s. 'But far too . many still lose their lives prematurely to this devastating disease so . it’s vital that the public continue to support the charity’s research . which is entirely funded by their generosity.' Mr Packham also criticised Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson for his plans to create a colony of lemurs, disappearing from its native African habitat, on an undeveloped island he owns in the Caribbean. He told the magazine: 'Richard Branson has been putting lemurs on an island in the Caribbean. I’ve got nothing whatsoever against Richard Branson, but that is grotesquely misinformed. 'These are animals that should be on Madagascar; they don’t want to be in the Caribbean. 'Richard’s money could be far better spent. We just need to tap into these people and say, ""Come on, you’ve got the funds - if you want to make a difference you really can, so help us out.""’ Asked if there are species we should be especially concerned about,Packham replied: ‘The children out in the woods, out in the fields, enjoying nature on their own – they’re extinct. I walk my dogs twice a day when I’m at home in the New Forest... when I was a kid there would be other kids out in the woods, making camps, starting fires, catching grass snakes – and they’re not there any more. ‘Risk aversion is killing childhood. I can’t tell you how many times I fell out of a tree when I was a kid. I once fell from 40ft onto a barbed- wire fence covered in brambles. I’m still here to talk about it. I have a scar in my groin. I’m not showing it!’ Packham made his latest wide-ranging and controversial comments in a joint interview with his Springwatch co-host Bill Oddie, 72, for the Radio Times to mark the tenth birthday of the popular programme .","Wildlife expert, 53, also declared economic growth is a 'recipe for disaster'

"Pigs which are shot at and blown up for training into battlefield injuries are treated ‘humanely’, a defence minister has claimed. Philip Dunne refused to ban the tests which have seen scores of animals blown up in the last three three years. Animal rights groups have condemned the exercises and insisted modern alternatives could be found, but Mr Dunne insisted nothing was as realistic as using the ‘live pig models’. Scroll down for video . Training: The Ministry of Defence has defended its involvement in the 'cruel' practice of blowing up pigs . Last month it was revealed that more than 100 pigs have been blown up in Britain over a three-year period for research into battlefield injuries . Figures released last month showed 115 pigs have been killed to test if they could be saved after being injured in blasts. In one test a group of farm animals were put in body armour before being blown up at a military base in Porton Down, Wiltshire. Green MP Caroline Lucas called on the Ministry of Defence to ‘abandon the use of live pigs in military battlefield exercises’. She urged the government to hold talks with Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland ‘to learn from their use of mannequins as a replacement’. Defence minister Philip Dunne said there was no alternative to the experience surgeons get from treating live pigs . But ministers insist the exercise are the only way to replicate the injuries soldiers sustain on the frontline, in order to give military medics training in how to treat horrific wounds. Responding to a parliamentary question, Mr Dunne said: ‘As a key element in their training for operational deployment, members of the UK Defence Medical Services attend military Exercise Surgical Training courses in Denmark. ‘These exercises are essential to ensure our medical personnel are capable of carrying out potentially life-saving surgery on casualties with serious bullet and blast wounds. ‘Injuries of such severity are not routinely encountered during their clinical practice in NHS hospitals, but they are regularly required to treat them when on operational deployment. Participating in Danish training minimises the number of animals involved. ‘The pigs are treated humanely with full use of anaesthetics. There are a number of sophisticated simulation models on the market that provide effective training in certain surgical techniques, and the Ministry of Defence already uses these where clinically appropriate. ‘However, none of those currently available provide a viable alternative to the serious bullet and blast wound training that our surgeons receive from live pig models.’ According to latest figures, some . 21 pigs were blown up in 2010, 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012. Animal . welfare group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) has . urged the military to stop the practice. The . group said that more than 80 per cent of Britain’s allies in the North . Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) - including 20 EU member states - no . longer train military medical personnel using animals. Row: Peta said that more than 80 per cent of Britain's allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - including 20 EU member states - no longer train military medical personnel using animals .

I felt really well-rested after the nice, long nap I had in the first debate.'

'Earlier today I went shopping at some stores in Midtown,' Obama said. 'I understand Gov. Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown.' Obama noted than Mitt is actually Romney's middle name - before pausing for comic affect he added: 'Wish I could use my middle name' - which is Hussein. He also made a spikier comment saying: 'Of course, the economy's on everybody's minds. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since I took office.' Instead of adding a pay-off line, he looked dead-pan and added: 'I don't have a joke here. I just thought it would be useful to remind everybody that the unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been since I took office. And we're getting to that time when folks are making up their minds.' Obama also noted that he was preparing for the final debate with Romney on Monday, which will focus on foreign policy. 'Spoiler alert: We got bin Laden,' Obama quipped.

In a television interview earlier on Thursday, Obama rejected criticism that his administration has offered a confused response to the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya, an accusation Romney has made repeatedly in the campaign for the White House. Of any breakdown that might have led to the killing of four Americans, Obama declared: 'We're going to fix it.' Obama made the comments on The Daily Show on Comedy Central. Host Jon Stewart turned serious in pressing Obama over the government's changing explanation about the attacks in Benghazi. When Stewart suggested that even Obama would concede his administration's coordination and communication had not been 'optimal,' Obama said: 'If four Americans get killed, it's not optimal. We're going to fix it. All of it.' Friendly greeting: Cardinal Dolan moves out of the way to let Mitt Romney and US President Barack Obama shake hands .

Public opinion: Protesters wear Obama and Romney masks as they take part in rally in support of Medicaid funding, outside the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York . Romney has pointedly questioned Obama's handling of the matter and his honesty about it to Americans. Those accusations led to the fiercest conflict of the presidential debate on Tuesday and will surely come to the fore again on Monday in the campaign's final debate. The bickering between campaigns eased briefly at the Smith dinner, named for the four-term Democratic governor of New York who lost the 1928 presidential race to Republican Herbert Hoover.

"Two sex therapists have sparked outrage in the Netherlands by calling for 'virtual' child porn to be legalised to relieve the urges of paedophiles. Amsterdam hospital sexologists Rik van Lunsen and Erik van Beek claim allowing perverts to view drawings or computer-generated images of children would 'regulate their desires'.

Controversial: Two sex therapists have sparked outrage in the Netherlands by calling for 'virtual' child porn to be legalised to relieve the urges of paedophiles . Reaction: The comments from the pair who run the sexology department at Amsterdam's Univeristy Hospital have sparked shock on Dutch Internet forums . But Mr Van Beek told the Dutch media:'I think that repressing you fantasies can lead to frustration and ultimately, for some types of paedophile, to a greater likelihood of doing something wrong. 'If you make virtual child pornography under strict government control with a label explaining that no child was abused, you can give paedophiles a way of regulating their sexual urges.' Horror: The idea of sexualising children has provoked shock and outrage . Mr van Lunsen added:'We don't make enough of a distinction in public debate between 'healthy' paedophiles, people who are not paedosexually active, and delinquent paedosexuals.

"With its thundering, round-the-clock traffic, Talgarth Road in West London is hardly the place you would expect to find a row of houses purpose-built for painters to gather inspiration. But it’s on this section of the A4 in Baron’s Court where you’ll find a terrace of Art and Crafts-era dwellings known as St Paul’s Studios, which were indeed created as artists’ homes. Amid the rows of conventional Victorian terraces that line this artery linking Central London, Heathrow Airport and the West, the eight houses stand out majestically with their soaring chimneys and red-brick and terracotta exteriors. But their most distinctive feature – north-facing double-storey windows – provides the biggest clue to the fact that they were designed for artists. The muted yet constant light that comes through the expansive panes would greatly enhance the conditions for any painter’s work. Inspirational: The reception room in the house on Artists' Row, home of painters . In 1891, when the eight houses were built, the area was an altogether more peaceful setting than now, and a colony of artists, including Pre-Raphaelite painter Sir Edward Burne-Jones, were already living nearby. Landscape painter William Logsdail and illustrator Charles Sims were among those who made their homes here a century or so ago. The houses went on to attract residents from the arts in general – most famously the great ballerina Margot Fonteyn, as well as Ernest Gebler, a bestselling author in the Fifties who is better known today as having been married to writer Edna O’Brien. Anyone with £1.3 million to spend can purchase 135 Talgarth Road, a house at one end of the terrace, which has been put up for sale by 92-year-old American art dealer Dorothy Edinburg. The terrace was built by architect Frederick Wheeler, who picked the location – then called Colet Gardens – because of what was an almost rural view looking out over the playing fields of the fee-paying St Paul’s School. Let there be light: The double-height windows on the top floor was built specifically to suit 'bachelor artists' and allow sunlight to flow into the studio . St Paul's Studios: The eight houses were build in 1981 to become the perfect home for artists and painters . Wheeler designed the houses for ‘bachelor artists’. Each property had a bedroom, reception area and a bathroom on the ground floor for the artist, and a scullery, kitchen and bedroom in the basement for a housekeeper. Upstairs, the artists would work in the studio behind the vast window. Though there was no major road nearby, Barons Court Underground station, which opened in 1874 to serve the District Line, lay immediately behind the terrace’s small, south-facing gardens to provide a convenient transport link. But in the Sixties, Colet Gardens became an extension of Talgarth Road, which was widened to become the A4 trunk road. Meanwhile, St Paul’s School moved to nearby Barnes. First council flats were built on its old playing fields, followed in 1980 by West London College. Dorothy bought No 135 in 1971. ‘I had . arrived in London from Boston and was determined to live in an area . where there were artists and I found this community,’ she recalls. ‘None . was for sale so I just knocked on the door of No 135 and asked the . people who lived there if they were willing to sell. Fortunately they . were.’ Famous neighbour: Ballerina Margot Fonteyn had a house in the same terrace on Talgarth Road . No 135’s layout . remains almost as Wheeler built it, except for one key detail. The . previous owner had put in a ‘false’ floor dividing the double-storey . window, and Dorothy has never removed it. Rather than modernising the house, which was given a Grade II listing in 1970, she set about restoring it to how it would have looked in its Arts and Crafts heyday. ‘I scoured all the furniture shops in the area for items to recreate the 1890s look,’ she remembers. As a result, walking into the house now, more than 40 years since Dorothy arrived, is like entering a time warp. There is no central heating and any potential buyer, while admiring the historic interiors, would probably be keen to bring it up to date. While Dorothy was keen to reverse time inside No 135, she says that outside, things have improved since 1971, despite encroaching urbanisation. Times a-changing: Although it is now next to a busy road, the location was originally chosen for its 'rural views' ‘This area was a very different place back then,’ she says. ‘There were still bomb sites with rubble strewn around and car parks where houses once stood.’ Despite the grim environment, the house provided exactly what she wanted – a seat in a buzzing artistic community. ‘I remember Margot Fonteyn lived at the other end of the terrace and I had wonderful parties in the house with all the top art agents of the day,’ says Dorothy, who has bequeathed her collections of Chinese ceramics of the Tang and Song dynasties and Old Master drawings to the Chicago Institute of Art. Dorothy continues to be an active player on the arts scene but, with other properties in Chicago and Boston, she no longer needs her home in London. lMarsh & Parsons, 020 7605 7760, marshandparsons.co.uk .",Grade II listed property designed specifically for single painters up for sale .
"The wasteful’ NHS should not be exempt from spending cuts, a senior Tory said yesterday. Former Cabinet minister Liam Fox urged David Cameron to scrap the so-called ring-fence that has protected health spending since the election despite austerity cuts at other departments. Dr Fox, a former GP who was Tory health spokesman in opposition, said the policy of pouring ever more money into the NHS to improve standards had been ‘tested to destruction’. Standard bearer: Former Cabinet minister Liam Fox, left, urged David Cameron, right, to scrap the so-called ring-fence that has protected health spending since the election despite austerity cuts at other departments . He warned that Britain’s ability to successfully treat certain  conditions was exceeded by other nations despite massive investment during the last 15 years. His intervention will fuel the internal Tory debate about whether the pledge should be repeated at the next election. Dr Fox, who is seen as a standard-bearer for the Tory Right, said: ‘A lot of our health indicators lag behind other countries, particular things like stroke outcome or a lot of cancer outcomes. ‘We’ve become obsessed with throughput and not outcomes and that has been hugely to the detriment of patients. If you treat the NHS itself as the important entity and not the patients, then you’re on a hiding to nothing.’ He also said the decision to protect NHS budgets reduced the incentive to tackle inefficiency, adding: ‘Anybody who has worked with the NHS knows there is still a huge amount of waste.’ But a senior Tory source said: ‘The Prime Minister has been very clear – the ring-fencing of health spending was a manifesto commitment and it will remain.’",Liam Fox said pouring ever more money into the NHS was not working .
"A California tea party group sued the Internal Revenue Service on Monday, saying it was among the conservative organizations the federal government targeted for special scrutiny because of its political positions. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, seeks the certification of a class action, which could open the floodgates for as many as 300 other right-wing groups to join the legal effort. NorCal Tea Party Patriots, based in Colfax, California, told the court that the IRS discriminated against it because of the beliefs of its members, subjecting it to 'a lengthy and costly delay in recognition of their tax-exempt status, and the required disclosure of the personal political beliefs, writings, thoughts, and activities' of its members. NorCal's website describes its members as 'volunteers who simply love their country and want to save it from a tyrannical takeover.' Ginni Rapini, the group's founding president, told KGO-ABC7 in San Francisco last week that the IRS made unreasonable demands when she applied for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status for the organization. 'They wanted every email I had ever sent out,' she said. 'They wanted the transcripts of every speech from any speaker at any event, meeting or anything that we had had.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ginni Rapini leads the NorCal Tea Party Patriots, which is suing the IRS over behavior for which the IRS has apologized. For more than two years during the Obama presidency, the agency targeted conservative groups for unusual auditing when they applied for tax-exempt status . NorCal has organized protests at the California state capitol, events that the IRS asked about, demanding copies of leaflets and letters to legislators . Like hundreds of other groups, she waited for more than two years while her application sat in the IRS's Cincinnati, Ohio office, never hearing from the agency why it was being delayed. NorCal's tax-exempt status was granted in August 2012, nearly 29 months after the application was filed. The delays were unreasonable, according to the federal lawsuit, 'because if their tax-exempt status had been ultimately denied they would have been forced to retroactively file tax returns and pay taxes and penalties for up to two years while their applications were pending.' In addition to the IRS, NorCal's lawsuit leaves open the possibility of naming as many as 100 'John Doe' defendants, allowing for the future addition of individual government officials and political figures. The group says the IRS violated the Privacy Act of 1974, which prohibits federal government agencies from keeping more records than they need to fulfill the legal requirements of their missions. The Act also requires the IRS to 'maintain no record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment' unless a federal law requires it, or the individual gives permission. Cincinnati attorney David Langdon filed the lawsuit on NorCal's behalf, He works with Citizens for Community Values, a 'Judeo-Christian moral values' group that crusades against pornographers and strip clubs . The IRS demanded the answers to an extensive list of questions from NorCal, similar to those seen by other tea party groups, requiring it to turn over copies of leaflets distributed at all its rallies, letters it sent to members of Congress, the names of all its donors and the amounts they contributed. In its lawsuit, NorCal also claimed the IRS violated its rights under the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. '[T]he IRS engaged in systematic discrimination based upon the speech, expressed viewpoints, and association of NorCal Tea Party Patriots, its members, and similarly situated groups,' according to the lawsuit. 'It subjected them to harassment, unfair delay, denial of governmental benefits, and impaired their ability to participate in the political process.' It's unusual for class actions to be . certified against the U.S. government, and NorCal's effort could be . hamstrung by the fact that while the IRS centrally managed the tax-exempt application process from its Cincinnati office, some tea party groups received demand letters from offices in other states. At least two groups received letters . from IRS offices in California, and another received letters from an IRS . office in Washington, D.C. Tea Party groups in more than 40 states could ultimately join the class-action lawsuit against the IRS if a federal judge rules that it can proceed . NorCal Tea Party Patriots says it's a grassroots group composed of 'volunteers who simply love their country and want to save it from a tyrannical takeover' NorCal's attorneys are standard-bearers on the Christian conservative wing of Republican politics. Cincinnati attorney David Langdon represents Citizens for Community Values, a group whose goals are to 'promote Judeo-Christian moral values and to reduce destructive behaviors contrary to those values.' Among its efforts is a campaign against pornographers and what it calls 'sexually-oriented businesses.' Joshua Bolinger, NorCal's other lawyer, is allied with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a group best-known for defending public prayer in court cases nationwide, and for pushing back against same-sex marriage initiatives. Langdon and Bollinger didn't immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did the IRS's press office. Citizens for Self-Governance, a conservative group that says it aims to 'return American governmental power to the people' and disperse power and break the cycle of incumbency,' issued a statement of support for he legal effort on Monday. That group's founder, Mark Meckler, is also a co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, a group with national reach. He said that '[w]e stand shoulder to shoulder with all those known and unknown who have been abused by a federal government run amok.' Catherine Engelbrecht told Fox News host Mike Huckabee that federal government agencies contacted her 17 times with audit and lists of questions after she sought tax-exempt status for her tea party and for a voting rights organization . 'IS THIS STILL AMERICA?' Congressman Kevin Brady slammed former IRS acting commissioner Steve Miller for presiding over the political persecution of Engelbrecht, one of his Texas constituents . NorCal's lawsuit comes as Congress is pressuring senior IRS personnel, past and present, for answers about how America's tax collectors came to target citizens of one political persuasion for intensive audits before awarding tax-exempt status. The Senate Finance Committee will hear from acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller, Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George and former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman on Tuesday. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will call George and Shulman on Wednesday, along with Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin and Lois Lerner, chief of the IRS tax-exempt office. Miller and George have already appeared before the House Ways and Means Committee, testifying Friday. During that hearing, Texas Republican Rep. Kevin Brady stunned the gallery by asking aloud, 'Is this still America?' Brady told the story of Catherine Engelbrecht, whose conservative voting rights group True The Vote and tea party group King Street Patriots were among the organizations targeted by federal authorities after it applied for tax-exempt status. Tea party groups were on the rise and poised to return Republicans to power in Congress in 2010, when the IRS's alleged abuses began. NorCal's website claims groups like it were hamstrung by a politically motivated Obama administration that used its tax authority to push back against its ideological adversaries . Engelbrecht, her organization and her small business, he said, were subject to 17 separate inquiries and audits from federal government agencies. 'She received four FBI inquires,' Brady said, 'and her business received unsolicited audits -  unscheduled audits.' In 'the first contact we had from the IRS, in the first general round of questions,' Engelbrecht told Fox News Channel host Mike Huckabee, 'they wanted to see every Facebook posting we had made, every tweet we tweeted.' 'At some point those questions cross the line.' Both President Obama and his chief spokesman, Jay Carney, have been hounded by journalists on the question of what senior White House staffers knew about the IRS scandal and when they knew it. Carney said during a briefing Monday that White House Counsel Kathy Ruemmler was first alerted on April 16, in a 'top line' notice from the Treasury Department, followed by a more in-depth briefing on April 24. He also said that Chief of Staff Denis McDonough was notified about an Inspector General investigation weeks before it became public, but claimed that neither McDonough nor Ruemmler notified the president. 'Some matters are inappropriate to convey to him,' Carney told reporters during his daily briefing at the White House. Under mounting pressure, President Barack Obama announced May 15 in the East Room of the White House that acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller would be stepping down. It emerged hours later, however, that Miller's term as acting commissioner was already scheduled to end in early June . NorCal's Rapini told KGO-ABC7 that she believes Obama will find a scapegoat to protect himself and his legacy. 'I think he's been caught with his hand . in the cookie jar,' she said, 'and so he's going to say, ""Oh . yeah, shame on them."" And it's going to be somebody else's fault.' If the lawsuit survives a motion for dismissal, its fate will rest with a judge picked from among the southern Ohio district's eight full-time jurists. Four of them are George W. Bush appointees, three were appointed by Bill Clinton, and one was appointed by President Obama. A roster of six other part-time federal judges on semi-retired 'senior status' in Cincinnati includes three Ronald Reagan appointees, two from the Jimmy Carter era, and one appointed by George H.W. Bush.","NorCal Tea Party Patriots was targeted for special scrutiny along with hundreds of other conservative groups that applied for tax-exempt status .

"Hillary Clinton has blasted 'whining' in a tirade which appeared to be directed at a former staffer who complained that balancing a stressful job and motherhood was impossible. In an interview with Marie Claire magazine, the Secretary of State gave a stern assessment of a recent public complaint from Anne-Marie Slaughter in which she said holding down a high pressure job in government was incompatible with being a mother. Directly following this, was a quote saying: 'I can't stand whining. I can’t stand the kind of paralysis that some people fall into because they’re not happy with the choices they've made. Stop your whining: Hillary Clinton has blasted 'whining' in a tirade seeming directed at a former staffer who complained balancing stressful jobs and motherhood was not possible . 'You live in a time when there are endless choices... Money certainly helps, and having that kind of financial privilege goes a long way. But you don't even have to have money for it. 'But you have to work on yourself... Do something!' Ms Clinton came under fire after the piece, from this month's magazine, was published online yesterday, but her aides quickly came out in her defence, denying that Ms Slaughter was the particular 'whiner' the secretary of state and mother-of-one was referring to. Instead, she was talking about the fictional . character, Holden Caulfield, from classic novel 'The Catcher in the Rye,' who wasn't mentioned in the Marie Claire story. Juggle: Ms Clinton's remarks came after an assessment of a recent public complaint from Anne-Marie Slaughter, who said holding down a stressful job was incompatible with motherhood . Marie Claire: The anti-whining comments were made in an interview in this month's Marie Claire, pictured . 'It's outlandish and misleading for Marie Clare to imply anything else.' Ms Slaughter - Ms Clinton's former director of policy planning - wrote a controversial cover story for The Atlantic this summer called 'Why Women Still Can't Have It All.' In the piece, she explained that she quit her job because she found 'juggling high-level governmental work with the needs of two teenage boys was not possible'. She went on: 'Having it all was not possible in many types of jobs, including high government office — at least not for very long.' Ms Slaughter has now returned to an academic position at Princeton, where she worked prior to her career in government. According to the Marie Claire article, Ms Clinton said Ms Slaughter's problem was her own and that not everyone had the same experience. 'Some women are not comfortable working at the pace and intensity you have to work at in these jobs... other women don't break a sweat,' she said. 'They have four or five, six kids. They're highly organized; they have very supportive networks.' But in the interview, Ms Clinton emphasised that she's committed to improving the situation for women at work. She said making workplaces 'more flexible and creative in enabling women to continue to do high-stress jobs while caring for not only children, but (also) aging parents' was a priority of the government.","Secretary of State was being interview by Marie Claire magazine .

"A Norwegian politician has provoked outrage after posting a picture of herself wearing a wolf fur coat on her Facebook page. Campaigners, who fear that hunters may be about to eradicate the wolf population in the Scandinavian country, expressed their anger at the post by Sandra Borch. The former youth leader of the Centre Party posted the photograph on her page on Monday. Sandra Borch, a former youth leader for Norway's Centre party, posted the pictures of her wearing a wolf fur coat on her Facebook page. The move provoked angry criticism from animal rights campaigners . She told VG newspaper: 'I knew there would be reactions, but I want to show that I do not care.' Almost as soon as Ms Borch published the picture, people began to leave angry posts. Ms Borch has argued in the past that hunters should be allowed to kill wolves to protect their livestock . The politician has argued that Norwegian farmers should be given permission to hunt and kill wolves, to help protect their livestock. Siri Martinsen, the leader of the animal rights organization NOAH, condemned Ms Borch's statement, claiming the stunt was designed to provoke a reaction. She said: 'This initiative is quite predictable for a politician who so strongly advocates the killing of wolves and the use of fur, with all the suffering it inflicts animals. 'She's doing this very clearly to provoke, but I'm pretty sure it does not change the attitude of large sections of the population in Norway who say 'no' to the hunting of wolves and who are critical of the fur industry.' The Progress Party - the junior party in Norway's right-wing government - has said it has no objection to the complete eradication of wolves. At the start of each hunting season there are normally around 50 of the animals in the country. That number is expected to fall to just 20 by the close of the season, with some moving across the border to Sweden but many killed at the hands of the hunters.","Former youth leader of Norway's Centre Party Sandra Borch has provoked outrage after uploading the pictures onto her profile on Monday .

"George Galloway has called in his lawyers over Jemima Khan's claim that he converted to Islam in a 'phantom' ceremony more than a decade ago. The socialite had said the maverick MP took part in a 'shahadah' conversion, attended by members of the Muslim Association of Great Britain. Mrs Khan, who herself became a Muslim ahead of her failed marriage to cricketer Imran Khan, claimed she knows someone who attended the event in north-west London in an article in the New Statesman magazine. But Mr Galloway, who was elected to Parliament as MP for Bradford West in a by-election last month, angrily denied that any ceremony had taken place. War of words: Jemima Khan, right, wrote that George Galloway, right, converted to Islam in a secret ceremony more than a decade ago. He has denied ever taking part in such a ceremony . Last night, he issued a statement saying: 'The further allegations from the New Statesman in response to my rebuttal moves the issue into the area of defamation. 'Jemima Khan asked me on tape about this phantom ceremony in Kilburn . and I told her it was a lie and whoever told her it was a liar. 'No trace . of this exchange appears in the New Statesman piece, . which is predicated upon it. Now that they are denying my denial it . places the matter in the hands of my solicitor.' The four times married 57-year-old had refused to deny claims that he is a Muslim. In the media, Mr Galloway has always been widely referred to as a Catholic. But the four times married 57-year-old had refused to deny claims that he is a Muslim. In the days before his shock landslide by-election victory last month, a letter - which Mr Galloway denies being behind - went out to voters highlighting his record of support for Palestine, his work for 'the freedom of Kashmir' and his abstention from alcohol. It added: 'God knows who is a Muslim. And He knows who is not. Instinctively so do you.' Elected: Bradford West MP George Galloway takes his seat in the House of Commons earlier this month for the first time after winning a by-election . George Galloway took to Twitter to angrily deny Mrs Khan's claim that he converted to Islam . Jemima Khan hit back asking 'what's wrong with being a Muslim?' Ms . Khan, who interviewed the MP in his new constituency, which has a large . Muslim community, started the article: 'George Galloway, MP for . Bradford West, is a Muslim. 'He . converted more than ten years ago in a ceremony at a hotel in Kilburn, . north-west London, attended by members of the Muslim Association of . Great Britain. 'Those close to him know this. The rest of the world, including his Muslim constituents, does not.' Claims: Jemima Khan's allegations were published in the New Statesman magazine today . Ms Khan tells Mr Galloway she knows someone 'who attended your shahadah' and says, 'so you converted?' According to the article he replied: 'I can't answer that. God knows who is a Muslim.' The interview was carried out as Ms Khan and Mr Galloway ate a halal meal. When being sworn in as an MP Mr Galloway chose to affirm, rather than make the pledge on a religious text. He told Ms Khan: 'People ask me this, why did I affirm in Parliament when I swore in? 'The answer is: I had to take an oath of allegiance in which I don't believe, to the Queen and all her heirs and successors, and I have no allegiance to any of them, and I could not possibly swear such a thing on a holy book. 'So nothing else should be read into the affirmation.' Mr Galloway claimed the article was littered with 'deliberate falsehoods' and 'schoolgirl howlers'.

"Amid the political boiling oil of three simultaneous scandals, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney continued Monday to defend the Obama administration's handling of troubles involving the Departments of Justice, Treasury and State. But reporters' eyebrows raised when he said that White House Chief of Staff Dennis McDonough knew about abuses taking place in the IRS and decided not to tell the president. In a briefing that started 45 minutes late after a one-hour announced delay, Carney said that 'no one in this building intervened in an ongoing, independent investigation' by the IRS Office of Inspector General, which was examining 'line IRS employees' who were targeting conservative groups for special scrutiny. 'We did not have a copy of the draft report, we did not know the details, the scope, or the motivation surrounding the misconduct,' Carney said. 'And we did not know who was responsible.' But he confirmed that on April 24 Kathy Ruemmler, the White House Counsel, was notified about the investigation. He also said the White House chief of staff learned about it, as 'some other members of the senior staff - I don't have a list.' They decided, Carney recalled, to keep Obama in the dark. 'Some matters are inappropriate to convey to him,' Carney said. 'It . is entirely appropriate that the president not be notified' of ongoing . investigations,' he told reporters. 'The suggestion of alerting him is . that he should do something,' perhaps prematurely. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . White House Counsel Kathy Ruemmler (L)  is the White House Counsel who first learned about the IRS investigation into agents who targeted tea party groups. James Rosen (R) is a Fox News reporter whose personal emails, phone records, and entry logs into federal buildings were snooped on by the DOJ . On April 16, he added, the White House Counsel's Office had received a 'top line,' non-specific notification that an investigative report would be forthcoming. 'The Hill also got briefings,' Carney said, referring to members of Congress on Capitol Hill. And like the White House, he said, Congress took no action. 'The cardinal rule,' he insisted, is that 'you do not intervene in an independent investigation.' Polls show an increasing number of Americans believe the IRS's targeting of tea party groups, the State Department's involvement in sanitizing a CIA assessment of the 2012 Benghazi terror attack and the Justice Department's investigation of reporters at the Associated Press are serious problems that have caused them to lose faith in the president and his team. Ruemmler embraced President Obama upon the news that the Supreme Court had upheld the Obamacare law, as then-White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew (L) looked on . On Monday, Fox News Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen became the second First Amendment casualty in the Obama administration's probes into journalists' sources and communications. The Washington Post reported Monday that the Justice Department investigated Rosen's contacts with a State Department source, tracking his phone calls, rummaging through his personal emails and tracing his entries into and exits from government buildings. Carney refused Monday to comment on 'an ongoing investigation,' falling back on previous statements that straddled the line between press freedoms and national security. Obama, he said, is 'a strong believer in the first amendment' but also 'insistent that we protect our secrets' as a nation. 'We take very seriously the leaks of classified information,' he added,' referring to both the AP and Fox News cases. But he wouldn't answer a question from Fox News about whether the While House believes Rosen is a criminal because he did his job and developed a source inside the State Department. And he dodged a question about how he personally views the scandal. Carney was the Washington Bureau Chief for Time Magazine before joining the Obama administration. 'I'm here as a spokesman for the president,' he insisted, before saying 'we need to find a balance' between protecting journalists' constitutional rights and preventing leaks of classified information to the media. Rosen reported in June 2009 that North Korea would respond to new UN sanctions by conducting a new round of nuclear tests. That report was based on a confidential source whom the DOJ has now identified. Carney continued to face brutally frank questions from reporters who may feel their ability to do their jobs without government interference has now been threatened by the Obama administration . Reaction from the press corps in general has been fast and furious, even bringing condemnation from left-leaning reporters who typically support the president's agenda. Liberal radio host Bill Press, Current TV host David Shuster and former MSNBC luminary Keith Olbermann have called for the resignation of Attorney General Eric Holder. And Glenn Greenwald, the progressive columnist at The Guardian in London, opined Monday on Twitter that '[a]ccusing James Rosen of committing crimes - for basic reporting - may be the most dangerous thing the Obama DOJ has done yet.' 'Who will be the first progressive pundit to defend the criminalization of James Rosen's report by the Obama DOJ or argue it's no big deal?' he asked his social media audience. Despite President Obama's claims on May 16 that he was unaware of the storm swirling around the IRS until media reports on May 10 put it on America's front-burner, news emerged Monday that Ruemmler was briefed on the agency's program targeting tea party groups and other political adversaries of the president in April. Full press briefing rooms have been the norm at the White House since a trio of scandals broke earlier in May. Jay Carney is the Obama administration's designated flak-catcher, parrying journalists' questions as nerves in the press corps fray . Obama told reporters on Thursday that 'I can assure you that I certainly did not know anything about the report' from the IRS Inspector General before portions of it were leaked to the media. Observers on the political right have speculated that either Obama was untruthful, or his White House is dysfunctional enough to lack a clear line of communication between the president and his top lawyer on matters of high importance to the American people. Carney also said 'no' to a question about whether or not the White House knew IRS Exempt Organizations chief Lois Lerner was planning to plant a question at an American Bar Association conference on May 10 about the tea party scrutiny - the action that launched the scandal. Republican lawmakers have come down on the IRS especially hard, grilling the now-former acting IRS commissioner in a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on Friday and gearing up for committee bloodbaths Tuesday and Wednesday, in the Senate Finance Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul suggested Sunday on television that the IRS had a written policy'' outlining how agents should single out right-wing groups for audits and other special scrutiny, 'targeting people who were opposed to the president.' Sen. Rand Paul spoke at a May 16 press conference in Washington with tea party leaders including Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann (L) Sen. Paul claimed Sunday there was a 'written policy' inside the IRS aimed at 'targeting people who were opposed to the president' 'We need to know who wrote the policy and who approved the policy,' Sen. Paul told CNN anchor Candy Crowley. 'We keep hearing the reports and we have several specifically worded items saying who was being targeted. In fact, one of the bullet points says ""those who are critical of the president,"" he said. Among the arguments IRS officials have made for their dramatic increase in scrutiny of tea party groups is the claim that applications for nonprofit tax-exempt status increased substantially in the wake of the Supreme Court's 'Citizens United' ruling, which cleared the way for such groups to enter into the political arena. But the Post ran a 'Fact Check' article on Monday giving that claim a dubious 'Four Pinocchios' rating for untruthfulness. Lois Lerner, head of the IRS's exempt organizations office admitted to targeting conservative organizations for special scrutiny, attributing it to a 'very big uptick' between 2010 and 2012 in the number of applications her office received for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status. The Post reported that the increase 'was relatively small,' however. 'The real jump did not come until 2011, long after the targeting of conservative groups had been implemented' in May 2010, wrote the Post's fact checker. A recently released IRS Inspector General's report indicated that 501(c)(4) applications actually declined between 2009 and 2010, from 1,751 to 1,735. The Post adjusted those numbers to reflect a calendar year instead of the federal government's fiscal year, and found a slight increase in the rate of applications per year, from 1,745 to 1,865.","White House didn't take action on a politicized IRS, Carney said.

"Swan song: All mute swans could be culled in New York under proposals being considered . New York has hatched a plan to rid the stat of the entire swan population, amid claims the birds have been responsible for attacking people, destroying vegetation and polluting the water with their feces. Draft proposals suggest killing or resettling New York's 2,200 wild mute swans by 2025. There are also fears that swans pose a threat to aircraft, much like the flock of geese that collided with a U.S. Airways flight in 2009, causing it to crash on the Hudson river. Since then the U.S. Department of Agriculture has carried out an annual cull on Canadian geese and wants to extend this to include swans. Opposition group Goose Watch NYC called the proposals 'outrageous' and said a 2,200-strong population of swans could not really pose a threat to a state where more than 18 million people live. Watch founder David Karopkin told AFP: 'It's just outrageous to try to . exterminate an entire species that has been living in the state for more . than 150 years, almost 200 years.' He added: 'I've yet to find anyone who has been seriously injured by a mute swan. 'When . they're being aggressive it's often in relation to them protecting . their nest, their babies. 'I mean people need to have some common sense.' Mute swans were first brought to North America from Europe at the turn of the 19th Century, to adorn city parks and large estates. It is thought that all wild mute swan populations originate from the release or escape of individuals from these early captive flocks. Wild mute swans have since flourished and the population in New York State alone has tripled over the past 30 years, in part thanks to people feeding the birds. Thriving: The population of mute swans has tripled in New York over the last 30 years . Among the 'lethal control methods' proposed to cull the birds are: 'Shooting of free-ranging swans and live capture and euthanasia in accordance with established guidelines for wildlife.' The draft proposals also suggest destroying nests and oiling, puncturing or sterilising eggs to prevent hatching. Some conservationists believe culling in New York state is absolutely necessary. Paul Curtis, associate professor of natural resources at Cornell University, said: 'The goal is to limit population growth in the wild, and remove swans from places where they cause problems or do damage to plant communities.' Meanwhile the state conservation department stands by the proposals, stating that the proposal to resettle the swans makes it 'balanced and comprehensive'.

"High profile celebrities including Katie Melua and George Michael were accused of hypocrisy yesterday for using an aggressive tax avoidance scheme despite preaching the importance of paying their taxes. They are among 1,600 wealthy celebrities, business leaders, lawyers and doctors who together tried to shelter £1.2billion from the taxman via a complicated network of offshore companies. Sir Michael Caine, Gary Barlow and two of his Take That bandmates, BBC presenter Anne Robinson and four members of rock group the Arctic Monkeys also invested in the highly controversial ‘Liberty’ scheme, a leaked database revealed. Scroll down for video . Scheme: George Michael has been named as one of 1,600 people who used the tax avoidance scheme Liberty to shelter a total of £1.2bn. The scheme is legal but has been investigated for more than a decade . Katie Melua reportedly sought to shelter £500,000 through the scheme in 2008, two years before publicly stating she paid nearly half of her income in taxes. A spokesman said she repaid the sheltered tax to HMRC . Melua was criticised by Christian Aid, . which nominated her for its Tax Superhero Award in 2010 after she . boasted of paying ‘nearly half of what comes to me in taxes’ to support . Britain’s public services. The . charity appeared to back a boycott of her music, tweeting: ‘You can buy . Katie Melua’s albums on Amazon. Alternatively, you can sign up to . become a tax justice campaigner.’ The . Liberty  scheme was ended in 2009 when a tax loophole was closed. But . HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is still waiting to challenge it in court, . with a test case due to be heard in March. Experts . believe the scheme will almost certainly be rejected, meaning the . celebrities and other investors face having to pay back hundreds of . millions of pounds. Georgian-born . Melua, 29, sought to shelter £850,000 through Liberty in 2008, paying . £59,500 in fees, according to records obtained by the Times. In the same year, she gave an interview in which she said she had . chosen not to avoid tax by exploiting her dual nationality – she became a . British citizen in 2005 – to put her earnings offshore. The . singer added: ‘I pay nearly half of what comes to me in taxes, but I . know I’m paying to live in a country with lots of amazing qualities.’ Other Liberty members include Gary Barlow, according to The Times . Christian . Aid said it was ‘morally wrong’ for people to avoid paying their fair . share of tax and described her actions as ‘very disappointing’. Joseph . Stead, the charity’s senior economic justice adviser, added: . ‘Companies, and individuals, often make the right noises about paying . tax, but don’t live up to them.’ A . spokesman for Melua said: ‘When HMRC stated they were reviewing the . scheme, she paid the tax to HMRC in full. HMRC are not out of pocket and . she has not avoided any tax liability.’ George . Michael, 51, whose wealth is put at £105million, reportedly paid . £443,000 to shelter £6.2million of his earnings via the Liberty scheme. But in 1996, the year before New Labour came to power, he told the Big . Issue: ‘I’d pay 50 or even 60 per cent to a Labour government.’ Actor . Sir Michael, 81, is said to have tried to shelter £600,000. In 2009, he . threatened to return to America if the top band of income tax reached . 51 per cent. Anne Robinson, . 70 in September, who reportedly invested £4million in the scheme after . paying £280,000 in fees, spoke in 2002 of how she paid ‘vast taxes’. Four . members of the Brit Award-winning Arctic Monkeys  – Alex Turner, 28, . Jamie Cook, 29, Nick O’Malley, 29, and Matt Helders, 28 – each paid . between £38,000 and £84,000 in fees to shelter between £557,000 and . £1.1million in Liberty. Gary . Barlow, 43, reportedly invested £4.46million, while his bandmates Mark . Owen, 42, and Howard Donald, 46, attempted to shelter £1.4million and . £2.1million respectively. Liberty . was legal, and some investors may have chosen not to claim the tax . relief arising from the scheme, or paid it back later. But . one tax expert said: ‘It is out-and-out tax avoidance. There is no . pretence, as far as I can see, of any commercial background to it.’ John Mann, MP said: ‘There is a lot of hypocrisy there. It’s just not fair on the hardworking, tax-paying public.’ An . HMRC spokesman said: ‘We are always happy to help the increasing . numbers who want to disentangle themselves from the increasingly . fruitless practice of tax avoidance.’ Sir Michael Caine reportedly used Liberty in an attempt to shelter at least £600,000. His spokesman declined to comment .","Investors in Liberty tax strategy reportedly include QCs, doctors and a judge .

"The stars are naked, but it’s not as sexy as it sounds. The Discovery Channel is getting ready to unveil two new survival reality shows featuring nude participants who will have to use their instincts and the elements around them, including mud, sticks and grass, to endure. ‘Naked Castaway’, which debuts April 14, features survivalist Ed Stafford who lands naked and alone on a deserted island southeast of Fiji with one only item: a camera. 'Naked and afraid': Survivalists Kellie Nightlinger and Erroll James Snyder on the upcoming reality show 'Naked and Afraid' on the Discovery Channel . Stafford, who brings no food, water, clothes, weapons or tools, will have to find and make his own using his bare hands in order to survive during his 60 days on the island. ‘Naked and Afraid,’ which debuts this summer, features two naked strangers who meet for the first time in Tanzania on the Serengeti plains surrounded by the wilderness and plenty of wild animals. ‘I’m an ultimate survivalist,’ one of the show’s female stars, Kellie Nightlinger, 38, told the Daily News. Nightlinger said she had been starving after spending two weeks in the wild when she devised an innovative way to catch fish using her private parts as bait and then trapping her meal between her legs. Survivors: 'Naked and Afraid' participants Alison Teal-Blehert Koehn and Jonathan Klay found clothing and built a fire on the Discovery Channel . ‘We needed something with protein and because the water was so muddy, traditional fishing methods wouldn’t work, so I had to improvise, adapt and overcome,’ said Nightlinger. During the night time, the female survivalist and her partner on the show, E.J. Snyder, a retired Army veteran, used a fire that they lit by rubbing sticks together to keep hyenas away. ‘They were frightening, but at least they seemed to be afraid of fire,’ she told the Daily News. Other episodes of ‘Naked and Afraid’, featuring different nude paired up strangers, have been filmed in Panama, Costa Rica, the Maldives and Borneo, according to Discovery. The strong survive: Teal-Blehert Koehn and Klay stand their ground . ‘I think the challenge brings out the very best and very worst,’ the show’s executive producer Steve Rankin told the Daily News yesterday from a hospital bed in Costa Rica where he was recovering after being bitten hours earlier by a venomous snake while working on the show. ‘The idea here is to push the ball down the field,’ Discovery channel executive, Craig Coffman told the Daily News. ‘Survival shows are so common now that it’s gotten more and more difficult to convince the audience that what they’re watching is something extreme. ‘Having no clothes just takes it to the next level. It’s the ultimate test and makes survival exponentially more difficult.’ Harsh reality: Teal-Blehert Koehn and Klay are put to the test on Funadhoo Island, Maldives on 'Naked and Afraid'","'Naked Castaway,' which debuts April 14, features a man left naked and alone on a deserted island who must stay alive for 60 days .

"Dozens of Muslim protestors gathered to demand that businesses stop selling alcohol in a popular East London area yesterday. The group, led by former Al-Muhajiroun leader Anjem Choudary, warned restaurants and shops in the Brick Lane area that they face 40 lashes if they continue to sell the product, which is banned under Sharia Law. Around 60 men and women in burkhas . handed over warning letters to Muslim-owned businesses in the area after . the protest was initially delayed by a small number of English Defence . League members staging a counter-protest. Scroll down for video . The Muslim protest, calling for the ban of alcohol in the Brick Lane area, was led by Anjem Choudary (pictured) Around 60 Muslim campaigners gathered in Brick Lane, East London, yesterday to protest the sale of alcohol . Controversial cleric Choudary was at the forefront of the protest. The Al-Muhajiroun group he formerly led has been banned under terrorism laws. Organisers told The Times the protest was held yesterday to coincide with the large number of office workers who would be in the area for Christmas parties. Choudary told the crowd: ‘The shops are run by Muslims and they know they are selling alcohol and they know the sale and consumption of alcohol is completely prohibited. ‘We cannot live among the non-Muslims and see this evil take place.’ He told those gathered it was his wish that Sharia law, banning alcohol, should be enforced in Britain. This photograph shows those who opposed the protest, which was staged in East London . A local man enjoys his drink as Choudary and others protest against the sale of alcohol in the UK . Protestors in burkhas hold up posters encouraging the ban of alcohol, in the name of Sharia Law . Groups associated with Choudary were labelled, the 'biggest gateway to terrorism in recent British history' He also defended three ‘fantastic’ men who were jailed last week for attacking drinkers while on a ‘Muslim patrol’. He was referring to an incident in which Jordan Horner and another Islamic extremist told a couple they could not hold hands while walking down the street, because it was in a 'Muslim area'. The radicals also attacked a group of men drinking in the road, and told a woman she would face 'hell fire' because of the way she was dressed. Horner, 19, Ricardo MacFarlane, 36, and a 23-year-old man who cannot be named for legal reasons were sentenced to 68 weeks, 12 months and 24 weeks in prison respectively. Groups associated with Choudary were last month labelled the ‘single biggest gateway to terrorism in recent British history’. The . radical Islamist has been identified as the link between groups who . encourage the safe passage of British and European Muslims into Syria . where they join Al Qaeda-linked forces. The action was delayed after a small number of English Defence League members staged a counter-protest . Anjem Choudhary told the group: 'We cannot live among the non-Muslims and see this evil take place' He told those gathered it was his wish that Sharia Law, banning alcohol, should be enforced in Britain . According . to a study by Hope Not Hate, organisations affiliated with Choudary . have encouraged in the region of 80 young British Muslims to join the . fighting in Syria. They may also have had a hand in the recruitment of 300 more on the continent, the report said. As . well as highlighting Choudary role in encouraging young Muslims to . fight in Syria, the report also established a connection between the . preacher's al-Muhajiroun network and high profile terrorists, including . those responsible for the 7/7 London bombings. The . report recommended that Mr Choudary should be considered a 'serious . player' in the promotion and recruitment of young Muslims to terrorist . cells. Sharia Law is derived from the Koran, the example of the prophet, Muhammad, and fatwas – or the rulings of Islamic scholars. It informs every aspect of the life of a Muslim, going far beyond the power of Western laws. The laws tell Muslims how to lead every aspect of their lives according to God’s rules. As well as banning alcohol, Sharia Law also outlaws meat which is not prepared in the appropriate way. A complex legal system, it clashes with British law in several respects. For instance, Sharia Law and British law have differing definitions of what constitutes marriage and how it can be ended. An East London Mosque spokesman and politicians in the area condemned the protest as a publicity stunt . Mr Choudary defended three men (not pictured) jailed for attacking drinkers while on a 'Muslim patrol' Dr Usama Hasan, of the anti-extremist . think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, told the East London Advertiser: . ‘In Islamic teaching you shouldn't drink alcohol, but you can't impose . Islamic law on other people. ‘This . is a democracy. To try and impose Sharia by force, which is their . stated aim, is completely stupid and against Islamic teaching.’ An . East London Mosque spokesman reportedly condemned the protest as a . publicity stunt and politicians in the area described it as . ‘provocative’. Labour . group leader Sirajul Islam said before the protest: ‘Everyone has a . right to peaceful protest but I urge the Shariah Project to think . carefully about the impact their actions will have.’ Muslim women and children join in the protest in the trendy area of Tower Hamlets yesterday .","Dozens of men and women gathered on Brick Lane, East London .

A grandfather who has spent his life ‘doing everything he wants’ has smashed a European record after completing a 100m race in just 32.79 seconds  – at the ripe old age of 104. Stanisław Kowalski, who was born in 1910, has become the oldest person in Europe to run a 100m race – smashing the record previously held by a 96-year-old. Mr Kowalski, from Świdnica, Poland, finished the Men's 100m Centenarians Race at an athletics event held at the country’s Wroclaw Stadium in a speedy 32.79 seconds. Stanislaw Kowalski, 104, from Swidnica, Poland, has become the oldest person in Europe to run a 100m race - smashing the record previously held by a 96-year-old . Despite never having had any professional training, he smashed his previous personal best of 34 seconds. The centenarian puts his good health and incredible stamina down to doing ‘everything I want’ and ‘never going to the doctors’. He said he spent most of his working life walking or cycling the 10km journey to work and only took up running as a hobby when he was 92. Speaking after the race today, he said: ‘I feel like a new man.’ The keen runner, who over the last few years has started running 10km every day ‘whatever the weather’, wore a yellow jersey with the number 104 emblazoned on the front for the record-breaking race. He is the only person over the age of . 100 to ever complete the race, which was held at the Wroclaw stadium . during the Youth Olympics.

He was presented with a bouquet of flowers and a trophy on the podium after the race – much to the delight of the cheering crowd. Mr Kowalski, who now aims to compete in the Senior World Championships in Torun, said eating moderately contributed to his good health. Asked for advice on how to live longer, he told Poland’s Gazeta Wyborcza: ‘Do not overfeed and do not eat at night. Sometimes you can drink 50 grams, but not every day.’ His grandson, Mark Baszak, added: ‘My grandfather always says “so as not to stress”. He is a very quiet man.’ The crowd clapped and cheered in support for Mr Kowalski as he made his way over the finishing line, ousting the current record holder – a Japanese man who completed the race in 28 seconds aged 96 several years ago . Prior to the race, Polish athlete Marek Plawgo - a 400 metre runner and silver medallist in the 2006 European Championships – took to his Facebook page to wish the ‘great’ competitor luck. He wrote: ‘The oldest European in history to complete a 100 metres run was 96 years old. ‘Stanisław Kowalski, a resident of Świdnica, is now 104 and will attempt to establish a new European record in a category which has no participants. ‘This means that Mr. Kowalski is only obliged to finish to be a record holder! ‘We will be there at the Wroclaw AWF arena to cheer on the great sportsman.’ Mr Kowalski is not the only keen runner to continue pounding the streets later in life.

"Conservative activists let it all hang out in a noontime tea party protest outside the Internal Revenue Service headquarters building in Washington, DC on Tuesday. About 70 protesters held signs, chanted slogans, and listened to speakers rail against what they called 'their 'unconstitutional' treatment at the hands of the federal government's tax authorities. 'Big government is the problem,' Tea Party WDC founder Lisa Miller told MailOnline. 'They're going to have to produce all the documents showing who ordered this persecution of tea party groups, when it happened, and how much President Obama knew about it.' Miller's group organized the rally, one of dozens held around the country, to highlight what she called the federal government's 'harassment and intimidation.' The largest protest, attracting a reported 250 activists, was in Cincinnati, the home of the IRS office that evaluates and approves applications for nonprofit tax-exempt status. That office, the IRS has conceded, unfairly targeted conservative groups for extra scrutiny based on their names and political positions. Protesters carried hand-made signs with political messages on Tuesday, including one that wouldn't be family friendly if it were spelled out . Tea party activists said they held President Obama responsible for the 'abuses' his tax collectors inflicted on conservative groups because of the political beliefs of their members . In Washington, organizers led chants of 'Big government! Big problem!' Andrew Langer, president of the Institute for Liberty, told the crowd through an electric bullhorn that 'if you leave here with no other message, it's that government has no rights.' 'People have rights,' he said. 'Government has power. And when those powers are abused, the people will ultimately take them back.' A trio of elderly Floridians joined in the protest. Cas Henderson (C) is 93 years old. Barbara Haskins (L), from Sarasota, said, 'I'm in full support of freedom of speech. We do this all the time in Florida' One activist, who would not give his name, wore a 'mask of intimidation and fear' to protest the IRS for using an extra layer of surveillance to evaluate conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. The back of his mask read, 'Don't audit me, Bro'!!' and 'Tyranny is a drag' Langer told MailOnline after the 45-minute protest that he doubts President Obama's claim that he knew nothing about the IRS harassing tea party groups until an Inspector General report was leaked to media outlets on May 10. 'No,' he said. 'Absolutely not. He's corrupt. And I find it fascinating how they're trying to spin this so the president isn't to blame.' 'We have to find out who gave the order to persecute the tea party, but the fish always stinks from the head.' 'If not Obama, then who?' he asked. 'If the White House is honest, Obama is either complicit or ignorant. I think they may be keeping him out of the loop - for a reason.' A tea party supporter dressed in Revolutionary War garb displayed a historical 'Appeal to Heaven' flag outside the IRS headquarters. The flag design dates to 1775 and was flown on ships commissioned by George Washington. John Locke wrote in his Two Treatises of Government that after men have exhausted all avenues of seeking justice, an ""appeal to heaven' is the option of last resort . Department of Homeland Security police protected the IRS headquarters building on Tuesday as tea party protesters gathered for their protest, one of many held throughout the United States . Asked about the president's chief spokesman at the White House, Langer said, 'I think Jay Carney is a useful dupe.' Ron Kirby, a demonstrator from Alexandria, Virginia, carried a sign reading, 'Don't target me, Bro' He said he is skeptical that Obama wasn't aware of the abuses going on inside hie Treasury Department until he saw a televised news report. 'This is too convenient,' Kirby told MailOnline. 'I'm wondering if he gets all his news about his own government from TV. Every time something big comes up, he's learning about it on CNN or MSNBC.' 'Isn't he supposed to know things?' Miller, the event's chief organizer, stopped short of calling for more IRS firings in addition to acting commissioner Steven Miller, who will step down just weeks ahead of his appointment's scheduled ending date. 'The problem, no matter who is in these jobs,' she said, 'is big government.' One tea party protester wore a 'FREE HEALTHCARE' t-shirt whose fine print read ''not counting higher taxes, Medicare spending cuts, the repurchase of Louisiana, a new airport in Cleveland and 2000 more pages of goodies. The message is a reference to pork-barrel spending and tax hikes that conservatives say is part of the President Obama's Affordable Care Act . Andrew langer (L) and Lisa Miller (C), addressed the crowd, saying that the growth of the federal government makes the IRS a likely place for abuses . Colorful characters were the norm on Tuesday, as were signs lambasting President Barack Obama. Ron Kirby (R) mocked the president for finding out about his own administration by watching television news programs . But Langer and others specifically mentioned Sarah Hall Ingram, the former chief of the IRS' tax-exempt division who is now in charge of the agency's office tasked with implementing new taxes under the Affordable Care Act. 'The idea that she has not been fired,' Langer said, 'is an indication of her importance to the administration and its twin goals: to destroy this movement and to implement Obamacare.' Phil Kerpen the former vice president of Americans for Prosperity who now leads his own group, American Commitment, told MailOnline that 'dozens of people should be fired' at the IRS 'because they were complicit. I think almost all these people have to go.' But 'at the same time,' he conceded, 'you could replace everyone at the IRS and they would still have the power to do this. What we should really do is limit their power to begin with.' Kerpen also noted the large cash bonuses that were paid to Ingram in recent years, totaling more than $100,000. 'Someone needs to ask President Obama if he personally signed off on Sarah Hall Ingram's bonuses,' he said. The federal government's Office of Personnel Management, he said, requires president approval of all staff bonuses greater than $25,000. Serious messages: Tea party activists carried stern warnings to the IRS after the agency targeted their groups for special treatment based on their political philosophies . A trio of elderly ladies including a 93-year-old visiting Washington from Sarasota, Florida, told MailOnline that they supported the tea party, and would have brought flags to wave if they had known no one would be there to hand them out. Spotting the police presence on the scene, including a cadre of officers from the Department of Homeland Security, a woman from Texas who identified herself as 'Mary' said she was surprised to see the government's police out in force. 'The gray-haired old ladies must look really frightening,' she said with thick sarcasm. 'How dare they exercise their freedom of speech.' About 70 tea partiers gathered in Washington, DC as their counterparts in other cities descended on federal buildings in protest .","'Harassment and intimidation' cited as conservatives blame President Obama for IRS targeting of tea party groups .

"An Indian couple who met at a legal firm have become the first in Britain to claim ‘caste’ discrimination, saying they were forced from their jobs following their marriage. An employment tribunal was told that solicitor Amardeep Begraj, 33, was from a higher caste than her husband Vijay, 32, the practice manager. He belonged to the Dalits, formerly known as the Untouchables because of the nature of their work in roles such as cleaning, pest control or scavenging, and the lowest class of people according to the ancient Indian caste system. Hand in hand: Amardeep Begraj and her husband Vijay are pictured outside the tribunal in Birmingham . Mrs Begraj has told the tribunal that a senior colleague warned her against marrying Mr Begraj because people of his caste were ‘different creatures’, while he was told his position at the firm was ‘compromised’. The case throws a spotlight on how the hereditary caste system, for centuries used to categorise people according to occupation or social standing in India, has gained a foothold in a contemporary Britain where five per cent of the population originates from the sub-continent. Dating . back to at least 1500BC there are dozens of different castes based . on race and religion, with most of these represented across Britain. Despite . being outlawed in the Indian constitution during the last decade, . experts say it is increasingly becoming a source of identity for young . people today. Children at a rural Dalit school in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh . For example . Britain's hugely popular banghra music scene was created by Jats, who . were originally rural people who composed this type of music to . celebrate the harvest in India. While . the Brahmins, generally considered the highest caste because they were . the most educated, hold meetings and group events so people can meet and . marry. Home Secretary Theresa May is considering whether to add protection to those discriminated because of their caste to existing safeguards governing race, sex, religion and sexuality in British equality law. Five Law Lords last year inserted a clause into the Single Equalities Act, passed just before the election, giving the Government power to forbid caste discrimination. But the issue was then referred for public consultation and the Coalition is now considering responses. Mrs Begraj, a Sikh, belongs to the Jat caste, an agrarian people from the Punjab. She and her husband met when both worked at Coventry-based solicitors Heer Manak and began dating four years later. Mrs Begraj told the Birmingham tribunal she was warned by a senior colleague. ‘He said I should reconsider the step I was taking of marrying Vijay because people of his caste were different creatures. Marriage would be very different from dating.  Vijay was told a number of times that his position had been compromised for entering into a relationship with me.’ She also claimed that her workload increased and secretarial support was reduced ‘as a punishment’, and she was paid less than colleagues. The couple married at a Gurdwara, or Sikh temple, in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, three years ago, when a colleague raised a toast to ‘Jat girls going down the drain’. When the couple had their first child, the firm did not send flowers, although this was standard practice. Mr Begraj, who worked as a practice manager for the firm for seven years, was sacked last year. His wife resigned in January. Last year the couple briefed a committee of the House of Lords, which swayed them to insert the clause in the legislation recognising caste discrimination.

"The perfect camping holiday used to depend on the weather, but since the opening of the world’s first indoor caravan park, not even the rain can get you down. The unique hotel experience can be found in Berlin, Germany where classic caravans and wooden huts have been given a makeover to suit even the choosiest hipster-glamper. The Huttenpalast, or 'Hut Palace' features all the classic caravanning accessories, from 'outdoor' communal areas to lights in the ‘trees’ to help you find your way around the campsite at night. Scroll down for video . Park up: Nestled among the birches is one of the ' Hut Palace' caravans offering a wagon-wide bed inside . Huttenpalast is the brainchild of Silke Lorenzen, and events manager, and interior designer Sarah Vollmer who wanted to create a hotel which kept the traditional campsite feeling. It is located in an old vacuum cleaner factory where the pair have incorporated the static wooden cabins and mobile touring caravans in place of traditional hotel rooms. Silke said: ‘We wanted to preserve the integrity of the building but also create a communal atmosphere for guests where people can actually meet each other. ‘We thought about a 'room-in-room concept' and decided to build little wooden cabins in the hall.' Retro sleep: The 70s style caravan on the right comes complete with a table and orange chairs on the 'grass' in the fake garden out front . Outside but inside: Although it may lack the fresh air of the outdoors, there is no risk of rain, hail or snow . Mobile home:The interior has been stripped out of the caravan and it has been converted into a cozy double-bed . ‘But we wanted more flexibility inside the place so it could be used for events of all kind as well so decided to put wheels under the cabins. ‘It was then we realised there are already cabins with wheels - caravans. 'Before we knew it we had three caravans in Huttenpalast.’ That 70s show: No ultimate hipster experience in Berlin would be complete without staying in a 70s inspired cabin. Just don't forget your moustache wax . Into the cave: One caravan has been covered in white stone mosaic . Off the rails: If a life on wheels feels a bit too wild and crazy, the hotel offers wooden cabins safely the ground . The pair have stripped the caravans of all the original utilities and redecorated each one with its own unique theme. One of them has been completely transformed into a cocoon-like hideaway with a wooden mosaic interior while another has been beautifully lit and fitted with a full size double bed. The third caravan has been provided with its own scenery, surrounded by birch trees and its residents are spoiled with a view - of the street outside. The 'ultimate urban camping' only costs €60 a night (around £50) and when you feel like breakfast, a little bag of fruit and croissants are hung on one of the branches outside your window.","Lights hang from trees and there is even a washing line - just like a traditional camp site .

"Rail minister Claire Perry has been accused of being a 'hypocrite' after it emerged she travels to Parliament by car - despite praising Britain's 'comfortable' rail services and 'fair' prices. Miss Perry travelled from her Wiltshire constituency to London 68 times last year - driving on all but two occasions. In total, the Tory rising star claimed back £2,689 in expenses for almost 6,000 miles in the car. Even if Miss Perry takes the train from her constituency of Devizes, Wiltshire, she is able to claim back the cost of a standard class ticket from her nearest station of Pewsey into London. Claire Perry celebrates being promoted to junior transport minister after leaving Downing Street in David Cameron's reshuffle last month . Out of the two commutes she made on the train last year, one was in first class - for which she claimed £91 back in expenses, the Sun newspaper reported today. Earlier this week, Miss Perry sparked fury by insisting rail passengers pay 'fair fares for comfortable commuting'. Yesterday it was revealed that next year’s increase is likely to be 3.5 per cent and some prices could rise by as much as 5.5 per cent. Fares have already increased by nearly 25 per cent since David Cameron came to power in May 2010. The worst-hit commuters will have to oay up to £200 extra for season tickets from January. But Miss Perry said: ‘What we have got to do is to make sure rail passengers – who could be forgiven for saying: ‘What on earth am I getting for these rises that I’ve seen over the last decade?’ – start to realise they are paying fair fares for comfortable commuting.’ General secretary of the TSSA rail union Manuel Cortes said: ‘Not only is Claire Perry guilty of insulting millions of rail passengers, she’s now found to be a hypocrite.’ A spokesman for Ms Perry said last night: ‘Claire often drives from her constituency due to personal circumstances. However, she regularly uses the train and completely understands that people’s journeys can too often not be good enough.’ And Ms Perry yesterday insisted on Twitter that she meant fares ‘should be’ fair. Commuters wait to squeeze on to the next train to Victoria Station at Clapham Junction, south London . Miss Perry's comments were met with scorn by commuters yesterday. Phil Guichard, 47, a marketing director, said: ‘I would like to see the minister on the 07.45 to Paddington. ‘It’s not comfortable at all. At peak times I’m lucky to get a seat.’ Julie Ward, 47, a nurse from near Maidenhead, said her experience was ‘horrendous’, but still costs £240 a month. She said: ‘I find it unbelievable that they can charge so much and give such awful service. ‘I’ve actually thought about videoing it and sending it to the minister so she can see what it’s really like. I don’t think she’d call it comfortable then.’ Another commuter, Iain Irvine, 51, said the transport minister needed ‘a reality check’ if she thought the railways offered good value for money. The company secretary, who gets a 5am train to keep down the £400 a month cost of his commute from Bristol to Paddington, said: ‘The only reason I use the trains is because I have no choice. If they want us to pay more they need to improve the services. ‘It’s just not good enough. If the minister thinks they represent value for money she needs a bit of a reality check.’ Rail fares will soar by up to 5.5% in January - and by an average of 3.5% - following this morning's announcement that RPI inflation was 2.5% in July . The annual increase in train fares is linked to July’s inflation figure, published this week by the Office for National Statistics, plus one percentage point. With the retail prices index at 2.5 per cent last month, this means rail fares will typically rise by 3.5 per cent in January 2015, although some increases could be even bigger. The Chancellor George Osborne could soften the blow, and he is likely to face growing pressure in the coming months to allow an increase of RPI but no more. But in a BBC interview yesterday, Miss Perry dismissed claims that train fares are cripplingly expensive. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said rail prices would rise by 24 per cent by 2018 . When asked whether it was fair that a London to Manchester ticket can cost £160, she said this was ‘only if you don’t book in advance’. In fact, the popular Trainline website yesterday showed a day return ticket before 9am to Manchester Piccadilly costs £164 to travel today. If booked a fortnight in advance, it is only £23 cheaper to travel at the same times. Questioned on Radio 4’s Today programme Miss Perry insisted: ‘People don’t just rock up to the station, like probably you and I do, and pay the maximum amount.’ The proposed increases are particularly painful because workers have faced six years of pay freezes, minimal rises or even cuts in wages. For example, the cost of a season ticket to London for commuters from Brighton is expected to jump by around £150 a year to around £4,455, according to the Campaign for Better Transport. This is the pressure group’s estimate of what the cost will be – although the rail operating companies have not yet published next year’s fares. Martin Abrams of the Campaign for Better Transport said: ‘If your ticket price is rising four times faster than your salary, or you’re a part-time worker with no choice but to pay for a full-time fare, or you’re stuck with creaking 30-year old diesel trains, or even if you’d just like a seat in return for your £5,000 season ticket, then your fare will seem anything but fair and comfortable.’ Mary Creagh, Labour’s transport spokesman, said: ‘This is shocking complacency from yet another out-of-touch Tory. Many passengers facing inflation-busting fare rises don’t even get a seat on their train to work, let alone “comfortable commuting”. ‘When you go through that every single day, the experience is not a good one.’ The Department for Transport said no decision has been taken about fare rises for 2015, but a spokesman added that the department was ‘looking closely at the cost of travel as part of our ongoing commitment to help hard-working people’.","Claire Perry has been accused of being a 'hypocrite' following revelation .

"Anthony Joshua could be in line to fight David Haye next summer as promoter Eddie Hearn plots the Olympic heavyweight gold medallist's path to become a world champion. Joshua heads the bill at this Saturday's Matchroom Boxing show at the O2 Arena in London when he looks to extend his unbeaten professional record to 9-0 in a WBC International title bout against Russian Denis Bakhtov. The 24-year-old will then face veteran Michael Sprott in a British title eliminator on November 22 on the undercard of the Tony Bellew-Nathan Cleverly grudge match in Liverpool. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Anthony Joshua's public workout . Anthony Joshua (left) could be in line to fight David Haye next summer, claims his promoter Eddie Hearn . Hearn, a columnist for Sportsmail, has tipped the London 2012 hero to cruise through those fights and is already looking to 2015 where he expects Joshua to rip through his British rivals. The winner of the eagerly-anticipated November 29 fight between Derek Chisora and Tyson Fury is on Hearn's agenda for Watford fighter Joshua, while a bout with 2008 Beijing Olympics bronze medallist David Price could also be on the cards. Should Joshua come through convincingly, Hearn has revealed he would love to stage a summer showdown with former world heavyweight champion Haye. Joshua will be in action on Saturday's Matchroom Boxing show at the O2 Arena in London . 'I would like to see him in with the Chisora-Fury winner and he will be 10-0 by then,' Hearn told ESPN's Nick Parkinson. 'If he's dealing with Bakhtov and Sprott inside two or three rounds, he's definitely ready for Chisora, Fury or Price next year. 'David Haye next summer might be a big fight as well if he's still fighting. 'They are all big fights but Anthony Joshua is going to be the money in the heavyweight division.' Haye has not fought since his fifth-round knockout of Chisora at Upton Park in 2012. But the popular Londoner, who faced the threat of retirement, is understood to be keen to return to the ring after a positive recuperation from shoulder surgery. Joshua (right) in action against Matt Skelton during their Heavyweight fight in July . David Haye lands a punch on Derek Chisora (left) during their vacant WBO and WBA heavyweight fight . Joshua recently spent time in Austria sparring with Wladimir Klitschko before the injured world heavyweight champion's postponed fight against Kubrat Pulev. As reported in Tuesday's Sports Agenda by Charles Sale, Klitschko, who famously defeat Haye in Hamburg for the WBA title three years ago, was 'surprised' by Joshua's tremendous speed and strength. It will be no surprise to Hearn, however, should Joshua one day succeeds current king Klitschko as the best heavyweight on the planet. Anthony Joshua is looking to follow in the footsteps of the legendary Lennox Lewis when he walks to the ring on Saturday. Lewis sported the iconic 'FCUK' range ahead of his historic 1999 undisputed heavyweight coronation against Evander Holyfield. And almost 15 years on from that memorable Las Vegas night, unbeaten Joshua picks up from Lewis as the revived brand's new ambassador. Joshua's collection, as seen in these pictures, is available now at www.frenchconnection.com and at selected 'pop up shops' on Regent Street and Oxford Street, London.

"The population of Romania has shrunk by nearly eight per cent in a decade, largely thanks to emigration. Figures from the country’s latest census showed yesterday that numbers have fallen by 1.5million over the last ten years. The key reason is that many younger Romanians have departed to work in countries including Spain and Italy, leaving behind an ageing population and falling birthrates. Romania's population is falling as a result of migration and a low birth rate. Last month several Romanian squatters were found to be living in a 'shanty town' illegally in north London . The census figures were published in . advance of the new wave of emigration expected at the end of the year. In January Britain will open its labour market to  citizens of Romania . and Bulgaria. More than 100,000 Romanians and . Bulgarians have already come to live in this country, but under EU . freedom of labour rules their citizens will be able to take British jobs . without restrictions from January. The figures released in Bucharest . yesterday showed that the Romanian population was just over 20million in . 2011. This was 1.55 million fewer than in the 2001 census. Last month dozens of Romanian immigrants were evicted from their camp on the former site of Hendon Football Club in North London . Some 68 mainly Romanian squatters were living in the huts made of plastic and waste wood amid filth . The population of Romania has fallen by 1.55million in just ten years according to the 2011 census . In 1989, when Romania emerged from the Ceausescu communist dictatorship, the population was 23million. David Cameron has come under pressure to maintain restrictions next year in spite of EU rules. Ministers are deeply aware of powerful indications that Britain faces a large new influx of migrants. Romania and Bulgaria are both deeply mired in poverty compared to most EU countries. A BBC Newsnight poll indicated in . April that 8.2 per cent of Romanians and 13.6 per cent of Bulgarians are . ready to consider travelling to Britain as a migration destination this . year or next. Britain is a much more likely . destination country than Italy or Spain, which are both suffering very . high unemployment as their governments enforce austerity to deal with . the euro crisis. Last month Police and immigration officials moved in to clear a ‘shanty town’ built by Romanian migrants in  a leafy London suburb. A total of 68 mainly Romanian . squatters were found living in huts built from waste wood and plastic . amid the filth of a tip at the former Hendon FC ground. The immigrants were said to have been living at the site for several months before the raid . The Roma travellers were given papers ordering them to leave the site which had 'danger' notices written in Romanian . Just . five of those at the camp, which was featured in the Daily Mail earlier . this month, were found to have the right to work in the UK. The rest were offered flights back to Romania at a cost of £50 per ticket to the taxpayer. Only 19 took up the offer. Those who didn't take the ticket were told they would have to . leave the country within 30 days, but were released on to the street to . live rough or in shelters. It could cost up to £15,000 for . police to find each of them, monitor them and eventually remove them. London mayor Boris Johnson recently said that the country should give illegal immigrants amnesty. He said the government had to be 'honest' that when someone has been in Britain for 15 or 20 years 'authorities no longer really pursue you'. But . the Prime Minister has rejected the idea, warning last week that it . would send out a ‘terrible signal of Britain as a soft touch’. Boris Johnson defied warnings from David Cameron to back the idea of allowing illegal immigrants to stay in the UK . The coalition has sought to take a . tougher line on immigration, unveiling a raft of measures to curb . benefit tourism and deport people in the UK illegally. Appearing on his new monthly radio phone-in on LBC 97.3, the London Mayor said: 'This is a chronic problem and if you . look at what has happened in this country over the last 20 years, we . have continuously failed to evict anybody. ‘If you look at the number of people . who are staying here illegally and you measure that against the number . that are meant to be on planes, it is absolutely astonishingly small. ‘The culture of human rights, the . immense power of the ambulance-chasing lawyers who immediately come in . and offer people protection against eviction, insert all sorts of delays . into the procedure. It is blindingly difficult to get people on to . planes. ‘They melt away into the maquis, into . the undergrowth, and they are lost again. It is one of the reasons . people lost confidence in the immigration system.’","Population of Romania has fallen to 20 million in the last 10 years .

"Mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik marched with members of the English Defence League last year. It is understood that the Norwegian gunman who slayed 76 people on Friday took part in a march organised by the far-right movement in Newcastle in May 2010 - and another in London. David Cameron said the claims were now being 'thoroughly investigated'. Protest: Norwegian gunman Anders Behring Breivik marched in this EDL rally in Newcastle in May 2010 . Rally: Breivik is also said to have met with EDL leaders when he visited Britain last year . Hundreds of EDL supporters, including . families with children, gathered outside Newcastle's Central Station . draped in St George flags. They chanted 'England 'til I die' and 'No surrender to the Taliban', 'You're not English anymore,' and 'We're going to go mental, chicken oriental.' At the march, hundreds of police officers, drafted from five different forces, guarded the streets to prevent clashes as Unite Against Fascism staged a counter-protest at the same time. Last year's march, although tense, passed without incident. Northumbria Police Chief Supt Graham Smith said at the time: 'It has been a great success. It has passed without incident. 'Newcastle is a city for peace and the aim of today was to allow peaceful protests which we have demonstrated is possible through careful planning.' Appearance: Anders Behring Breivik pictured leaving an Oslo court house after his first hearing . On Friday, Breivik, 32, set off a car bomb in the centre of Oslo that killed eight people, before travelling to an Utoya island, massacring 68 teenagers attending a Labour summer camp. A leading North-East member of the organisation Unite Against Fascism said it was no surprise to him that security sources were aware of Breivik's activity in this country. He said he had been on a counter demonstration to the EDL march. He said: 'It is alleged he (Breivik) has contacts with about 600 EDL contacts in Britain. Given that is the case, it is highly likely he will have had contacts with people in the North-East. 'Given that the travel links with the North-East and Norway are better than anywhere else other than London, I am not surprised that he attended here. 'The EDL and other far right organisations do operate internationally - they see themselves as almost Crusaders.' The English Defence League has issued a statement insisting that it has never had any official contact with Breivik and that there was no evidence that he ever registered as a supporter on the EDL Facebook page. But today anti-fascist organisation Searchlight claimed Breivik  was told he would be welcome at their UK demonstrations, to which he replied: 'I hoped so: it’s our common struggle against the islamofascists.' Breivik used the internet pseudonym 'Sigurd Jorsalfare', a 12th century King of Norway who led one of the crusades, to communicate online with supporters of the EDL and told them: 'You’re a blessing to all in Europe.' Only a few days before Friday’s attacks the messages to EDL supporters stopped as he began the final countdown to his massacre. Searchlight's editor Nick Lowles told the Evening Standard: 'This proves conclusively Breivik was in contact with the EDL, shared their aims and objectives and expressed a desire to join them on their demonstration. 'It is quite clear that the Home Office now need to classify the EDL as an extremist Right-wing organisation and to devote similar resources to monitoring their activities as they would other extremist groups.' In the online messages Breivik wrote: 'To you all good English men and women, just wanted to say that you’re a blessing to all in Europe, in these dark times all of Europe are looking to you in search of inspiration, courage and even hope that we might turn this evil trend with Islamisation all across our continent. 'Well, just wanted to say keep up the good work it’s good to see others that care about their country and heritage.' In another posting Breivik claims he visited Bradford with a friend 'some years ago'. He wrote: 'I’ve seen with my own eyes what has happened to england, i was in bradford some years ago, me and a friend walked down to the football stadium of bradford, real ‘nice’ neighborhood, same thing in the suburbs of London.' One EDL supporter then wrote to Breivik: 'Bravo, admire your views and courage. no surrender and welcome.' Yesterday, as Breivik admitted the killings but pleaded not guilty to criminal responsibility in a closed hearing, Prime Minister David Cameron said the gunman's links to this country were being investigated 'extremely seriously'. In a rambling 1,500-page manifesto Breivik posted online shortly before the attacks, he said that he was acting alone, but had been recruited to the radical cause by two English rightwing extremists at a meeting in the UK in 2002. He wrote: 'I used to have more than 600 EDL members as Facebook friends and have spoken with tens of EDL members and leaders. Carnage: Anders Behring Breivik opened fire on children who were on the Norwegian holiday island of Utoya . 'In fact I was one of the individuals who provided them with processed ideological material (including rhetorical strategies) in the very beginning.' Another source said a senior member of the EDL has also claimed Breivik met with the group's leaders in Britain last year, when he came to London to hear Geert Wilders, the Dutch right-wing politician, speak. He said: 'He is someone who can project himself very well and I presume there would be those who would be quite taken by that. It's like Hitler, people said he hypnotic. This guy had the same sort of effect.' The source told the Daily Telegraphy that Breivik knew three of four people in the group and told his Facebook friends he wanted to attend. He added: 'Geert Wilders was a high-profile anti-Islamic politician, coming to Britain. Everybody was raving about it. He was obviously in contact with some of us.' Respects: A candle-lit vigil in Oslo on Monday night saw thousands pay tribute to those killed in the twin Norway attacks . A Swedish politician with links to the far-right blamed 'immigration and Muslims' for the Norwegian massacre. Sweden Democrat Erik Hellsborn i Varberg wrote in his blog that he did not feel any guilt in sharing the opinions of Anders Behring Breivik. He wrote: 'If there was no Islamisation and mass immigration there would not have been something that triggered Behring Breivik to do what he did.' He later told Halland News: 'The ultimate responsibility always lies on the offender. 'But you should discuss the underlying causes that drove him, which was multiculturalism.' Breivik also referred to the BNP 23 times in his manifesto. The EDL, which has risen to prominence over the last two years with its anti-Islamist protests, has denied 'any official contact' with the killer. Breivik was placed on a Norwegian security watch list in March after his name was linked to the purchase of chemicals from a Polish supplier. But the head of Norway's police intelligence agency said they had not followed it up because he had only bought £11 worth of the chemicals. Mr Cameron, who yesterday discussed the massacre with security chiefs and senior ministers at a meeting of the National Security Council, said: 'We are still investigating these claims, so I don't want to give out partial information. 'We want to get to the bottom of this before making public announcements. But we take these things extremely seriously.' Cameron, who was at the Norwegian Embassy in London to sign a book of condolences, added: 'Everyone in Britain shares in the sorrow and the anger at the despicable killings that took place on Friday. 'Britain and Norway have been good allies and neighbours in very dark days before. We know that the resilience and the courage and the decency of our Norwegian friends will overcome this act. 'After such a dreadful event the British Government must of course review our own security at home.' The Evening Standard also reported that Searchlight has revealed that a millionaire computer engineer living in north London is a backer of the EDL. Alan Lake, 45, is said to have admitted providing funds to the organisation and is alleged to have posed online this week, in reference to the twin attacks: 'The chickens have actually come home to roost.' Mr Lake could not be reached for comment today.

"Vladimir Putin yesterday issued a thinly-veiled threat to arm Iran with missile defences if the West attacks Syria. The Russian leader said Moscow had provided elements of the S-300 military technology to Syria but had frozen further shipments, suggesting they could be routed elsewhere. That was widely seen as a threat to revive a contract for delivery of the S-300s to Iran, which Russia cancelled several years ago under strong US and Israeli pressure. Scroll down for video . Warning the West: Putin sought to downplay the current chill in the U.S.-Russian relations and said that the two countries need to cooperate on a range of issues in the interests of global stability . Assisting the enemy: The U.S. says Russia has provided military support to Assad that has allowed him to cling to power during Syria's roughly 2-year-long civil war . Mr Putin’s intervention came ahead of a G20 summit he is hosting today in St Petersburg, in which he is expected to hold a difficult one-to-one meeting with David Cameron. The S-300 system, which targets aircraft, cruise and ballistic missiles, would make military attempts to stop Iran building a nuclear bomb all but impossible without a ground invasion. Syria’s deputy foreign minister, Faisal Muqdad, said it would take ‘every measure’ if hit by a US-led military strike and would never give in, even if it led to ‘World War Three’. But Mr Cameron told MPs there was a risk of a ‘Armageddon’ for the people of Syria if the use of chemical weapons went unpunished. He suggested Labour and other opponents of military action were ‘letting down’ the people of Syria. Confident: US President Barack Obama, who earlier this week met members of Congress in the Cabinet Room of the White House, said he thought a resolution paving the way for military intervention in Syria would be passed . Mr Putin suggested he might back intervention in the UN Security Council if it was proved ‘beyond doubt’ that President Assad ordered a gas attack that killed 1,500 people, including hundreds of children, last month. But diplomatic sources said that despite ‘overwhelming’ evidence against Assad, Russia was considering publishing a dossier seeking to blame rebel forces trying to topple the regime for the attack. Mr Putin said it was ‘too early’ to talk about what Russia would do if the US attacked Syria without UN backing, adding: ‘We have our ideas about what we will do and how we will do it in case the situation develops toward the use of force or otherwise. We have our plans.’ The Russian leader called the S-300 air defence missile system ‘a very efficient weapon’ and said Russia had a contract for its delivery to Syria. United front: Obama speaks flanked by House leader of the Republicans, John Boehner - but many congressmen are still undecided . ‘We have supplied some of the components, but the delivery hasn’t been completed,’ he said. ‘We have suspended it for now. ‘But if we see that steps are taken that violate the existing international norms, we shall think how we should act in the future, in particular regarding supplies of such sensitive weapons to certain regions of the world.’ In another significant escalation of tensions in the Middle East, Russia dispatched a large missile cruiser to the Mediterranean. The cruiser, Moskva, will be joined by a destroyer from Russia’s Baltic fleet and a frigate from the Black Sea fleet, tasked with ‘protecting national interests’. Mr Cameron insisted it would be ‘very perilous’ for the US to follow Britain’s example and step back from plans to hit Damascus in response to chemical weapons attacks, but he again told MPs that Britain will not take part in military action following last week’s Commons vote.

"Nigel Farage has found himself at the centre of another race row over a survey which asked Ukip members to 'rate an immigrant' Nigel Farage was in another race row last night after asking supporters to rate ‘blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans’ in a game – with prizes of cash and a Ukip golf umbrella. The ‘rate an immigrant’ survey is part of a Ukip private survey of members aimed at helping the party draw up its policies. Sent last week by Ukip chairman Steve Crowther, it asks members to say ‘how close they feel’ to a number of groups. They include ‘Blacks, Asians, Muslims, English, Eastern Europeans and Whites’ as well as the four main political parties. Ukip activists are urged to rate each on a scale from 0 for ‘not close at all’ to 10 for ‘very close.’ But the survey was slammed as a racist stunt after details were leaked to The Mail on Sunday. Last night, senior Labour MP Margaret Hodge condemned the Ukip survey as ‘shocking’. Mrs Hodge, who won a campaign against the BNP in her Barking constituency in east London, said: ‘This openly brings race into politics. It’s shameful, it’s shocking and it’s offensive. 'It lifts the lid on the unacceptable face of Ukip.’ The survey comes after a series of claims of racism involving Ukip, although Farage has insisted ‘stupid or offensive’ comments by a handful of candidates ‘never have and never will’ represent the views of his party. The email to thousands of Ukip members from chairman Crowther is headed: ‘Help the Party and Win Prizes!’ It declares: ‘Ukip is growing quickly. We want to strengthen our party by understanding our rapidly growing membership. We are asking all our members to complete a new survey.’ The aim was to ‘use the insights to strengthen the Ukip operation… Your responses will be invaluable in making sure we fulfil our promises over the coming years – and in government! ‘So please, do complete the survey. It should be fun! You might even win some prizes!’ The party leader (pictured calling for debate on EU referendum with other party members outside No. 10 Downing Street) insisted 'stupid and offensive' views of individuals were not those of the whole party . Prizes included ‘one prize of £100, two of £50, three prizes of a Ukip golf umbrella, four prizes of £25, five Ukip notebooks and six Ukip pocket diaries.’ Other Ukip race rows include: . A Ukip spokesman denied the survey was racist, claiming every major employer carried out similar research of their staff.","Survey asked members to rate 'blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans'

"Which part of the country has the best sex? Online dating site LoveAgain.com surveyed 18,000 people throughout the United States, and according to the results, it depends on whom you ask. Despite the Midwest's tame reputation, . the people there have the highest sex drives in the nation at 53.5per . cent (in Illinois, women score 60per cent). Sadly, this doesn't . translate into action: Only about one in 10 report that they do it once a . week. Location matters: People in the Northeast have the most sex, but Midwesterners have the highest sex drive in the nation . Men and women from the Southwest rate themselves better in the bedroom than any other region - 56per cent think they have skills, compared to a national average of 53per cent - and women have a very high opinion of themselves at 67per cent. But they clearly aren't getting what they want, because Southwestern women are the least satisfied in bed. Take Texas, where the women score only 42per cent, even though 67per cent of Texan men are happy with the size of their package. The women of the West are a randy bunch: 59per cent of women . claim that they have a high sex drive compared to a national average . of 47per cent. Yet the men in . the region say they are less satisfied with their sex lives than . anywhere else, scoring just 32per cent. People in the South seem to be all talk and no action. Men and women both rate themselves as better in bed than their . partners, with 46per cent of men and 39per cent of women claiming that . they outperform their other halves. But they also have the least amount . of sex - a mere 10per cent say that they do it every seven days. Northeasterners have the opposite problem: People in this region have the most sex, with 25per cent of the population getting it on at least once a week. But they have the lowest sex drives of all (43per cent), with women scoring only 34.5per cent. Do the women in this part of the country have self-esteem issues? Only 28per cent thought that they are better in bed than their lovers, compared to their male counterparts who scored 41.5per cent. Along with the geographical gap, there is also a gender gap: nearly 60per cent of women report that they are satisfied between the sheets, compared to only 47per cent of men. The good news is that 16per cent of the population is making time for sex at least once a week, with Saturday being the most popular day.  Except in the South, where they like to get frisky on Mondays.","People in the Northeast have the most sex, but the lowest sex drives .

"A historic mansion perched on a picturesque bluff overlooking the Massachusetts North Shore is on the verge of being swept away by its new owner, the co-creator the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner. The Loring House, built in 1881 by a civil war general, was purchased two years ago for $3.75millon by Helen Greiner, of Roomba fame, who is now preparing to tear it down after failing to reach a compromise with preservationists. The Historic District Commission in the City of Beverly has spent two years trying to convince Ms Greiner, the co-founder of iRobot Corp that manufactures Roomba hoovers, to update the rundown mansion without drastically altering its look. Landmark: The Loring House was built in 1881 by General Charles G. Loring Jr on a bluff overlooking the Massachussets North Shore in the City of Beverly . Worse for wear: The house has been vacant for several years and has fallen into disrepair . Secluded spot: The 130-year-old mansion is hidden from public view and surrounded by trees and shrubbery . Owners: The mansion's first owner, General Loring (left), built the dwelling on land purchased by his father; the current owner of the residence, co-founder of iRobot Helen Greiner (right), is planning to raze it . But Greiner said that the organization has rejected every renovation plan put forward by her design team to make the rambling 130-year-old home more liveable on the grounds that the historical landmark would lose too much of its character. Pointing a finger of blame at the town’s activists, Ms Geiner, who now holds the position of CEO at CyPhy Works, which develops flying robots, stated to the Boston Globe that she would be moving into Loring House this year if it were not for the staunch opposition from the historic commission. But William Finch, the chairman of the historic commission, has claimed that under Greiner's renovation plan, the stately manor overlooking Plum Cove would be completely gutted and fitted with a porch, thus compromising the aesthetic and architectural integrity of the landmark. Smart sweeper: iRobot Corp's biggest claim to fame is the robotic vacuum cleaner Roomba . The Loring House was erected by Charles G Loring Jr, a Civil War general and the first director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, on a plot of land in Essex County purchased by his lawyer father in 1844. The mansion featuring rich wood paneling, winding staircases and impressive fireplaces, was designed by William Ralph Emerson, the cousin of famed poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, and it is considered the finest surviving example of Shingle style architecture. But the palatial oceanfront nestled in a secluded garden dotted with sculptures on Hale Street has stood vacant for the past several years and has become blighted. Helen Greiner, who bought the house in 2012 from members of the Loring clan, had planned to give the dilapidated house a thorough makeover in order to make it habitable again - but town officials feared that the renovation would change the historic mansion too much. When Greiner came back last year with a plan to demolish Loring House, the Beverly Historic Commission imposed a one-year delay, which expired in April 2014, clearing the way for the iRobt co-founder to raze the landmark to the ground. ‘It’s a tremendous loss to architectural history, and not just to people on the North Shore but to people across the country and all over the world,’ preservationist Bill Cross, of Manchester-by-the-Se, told The Salem News last month. A group of private citizens called The Friends of the General Charles G. Loring House tried to raise funds to buy the house from Greiner and donate it to Historic New England, but to no avail. Tug of war: Ms Greiner had planned to renovate the rambling mansion to make it more livable, but Beverly's preservationists objected to the makeover claiming it would change the character of Loring House . Period piece: The sprawling 130-year-old private home boasts several imposing fireplaces . One of a kind: The mansion featuring rich wood paneling and finishes was designed by William Ralph Emerson, and is considered the finest surviving example of Shingle style architecture . Interior design: Activists working to save the mansion have accused Greiner of planning to gut Loring House . Taste for the finer things: Judging by the impressive finishes and decor of Loring House, it is not surprising that General Loring went on to become the first director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts . Failed rescue: A group of activists had hoped to raise money to buy Loring House from Greiner and donate it to the town, but to no avail . Clock is ticking: A one-year demolition delay imposed by the Beverly Historic District Commission expired in April, clearing the way for Greiner to raze the house to the ground . Peter Loring, whose great-great-grandfather was Charles Loring’s brother, said of his ancestral home that he is going to miss it tremendously. Mr Loring was among a group of family members who pooled money together and bought the property back from previous owner for $4million in 2009, but they were forced to resell it at a loss to Greiner during the housing crisis. Ms Greiner said that as far as she is concerned, she had made a good-faith effort to find a middle ground with town officials, but when talks broke down with the preservationist community, she was left with only one option: to tear down the decaying mansion. ‘I’m the only person who actually spent money to save it,’ Greiner said .","The Loring House was built in 1881 by General Charles G.

"A group of astronauts have reached a landmark in their space mission by spending the longest amount of time in isolation. The Mars500 crew, however, is so far from the red planet that it is still in a car park in Moscow. They have now spent 438 days with limited contact with their friends and family - long enough for them to have made 73 return trips to the moon. The cosmonauts still have 82 days left of their 520-day mission when they will enter the record books again... for the shortest distance travelled. The crew has to make the most of the space they have on the 520-day mission . The crew was seen 'landing on Mars' after 257 days in the capsule before their return journey to Earth . They are part of an experiment to see what happens psychologically and physically during long-distance space flight in a simulated mission to Mars. The experiment is taking place outside the Institute of Biomedical Problems in a 550 cubic metre windowless space. A final kiss: The crew has had limited contact with family and friends over the last 14 months . Valeri Polyakov, the holder of the . real space endurance record of 437 days, told the Daily Telegraph that . it would be better for those 'on board' to concentrate on the future. 'Better now not to count how much time has passed, but how much remains,' he said. 'It has a positive effect. He spent his time on the Mir space station orbiting Earth in 2005. Three of the astronauts left the craft around half way through the mission to simulate going onto Mars. Russian Aleksandr Smoleevskiy, Italian Diego Urbina and Chinese trainee Wang Yue spent two days 'researching the planet' before getting back on board for the return flight. Like a reality television show, or even the 1978 movie Capricorn One, the astronauts are observed by behavioural specialists at all times. Their mission aims to help real space crews in the future cope with the confinement and stress of interplanetary travel. The crew members communicate with the outside world via e-mails and video messages - occasionally delayed to give them the feel of being more than a few yards away from mission control. They eat canned food similar to that eaten on the International Space Station and 'shower' only once a week - in a hot room like a sauna, wiping themselves with tissues. It contains six tiny sleeping pods with cot-like beds, a living room, a eat-in kitchen, a working zone, a toilet, a laboratory and greenhouse. The men in the crew have entertained themselves by swapping different cultural festivals such as Halloween . The isolation facility measures about 550 cubic metres and is based in a car park in Moscow . None of the men have considered . abandoning the mission, although they are free to walk out at any time, . mission director and former cosmonaut Boris Morukov said at the half-way . point. 'They are still . motivated, but there is a certain fatigue, which is natural,’ he said. 'It will be very tough on the boys because of the monotony. 'The fatigue and the thought that the mission is over can be fraught with negative consequences.' The . Mars500 experiment is being conducted by the Moscow-based Institute for . Medical and Biological Problems, the European Space Agency and China's . space training centre. In an effort to reproduce the conditions of space travel, with the exception of weightlessness, the crew has living quarters the size of a bus connected with several other modules for experiments and exercise. A separate built-in imitator of the Red Planet's surface is attached for the mock landing. The crew is made up of Frenchman Romain Charles, 31, and Italian-Colombian Diego Urbina, 27, who are engineers by training. China's Wang Yue, 26, is an employee at China's space training centre.",The Mars500 crew will also break the record for the shortest distance travelled on a space mission - not having left the Moscow car park where they are based .
"After months of speculation, the cast of Star Wars VII has finally been announced. On Tuesday Disney and Lucasfilm confirmed on the official Star Wars website that Girls star Adam Driver would take a part in the relaunched film as well as newcomers John Boyega and Daisy Ridley. Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson and Max von Sydow were also listed as cast members. It was also confirmed that stars of the original trilogy - Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew and Kenny Baker - would also be in the film, which will be directed by JJ Abrams and released in 2015. Scroll down for video... Confirmed: JJ Abrams, (15) at the cast read-through of Star Wars Episode VII at Pinewood Studios with (clockwise from right) Harrison Ford (1), Daisy Ridley (2), Carrie Fisher (3), Peter Mayhew (4), Producer Bryan Burk (5), Lucasfilm President and Producer Kathleen Kennedy (6), Domhnall Gleeson (7), Anthony Daniels (8), Mark Hamill (9), Andy Serkis (10), Oscar Isaac (11), John Boyega (12), Adam Driver (13) and Writer Lawrence Kasdan (14) A black-and-white photo of the cast and crew was accompanied by the announcement. Casting for the new film, which will be the first installment since Disney took over the franchise from George Lucas, has been so secretive it has been compared to the plans for the Death Star. It was first claimed by The Hollywood Reporter that Driver would play a villain in the film. In recent weeks it was speculated that Boyega (best known for Attack of the Block), and Isaac (who stood out in Inside Llewyn Davis) could be contenders. They're back for more: Harrison Ford (left), Carrie Fisher (center) and Mark Hamill (right) from the original Star Wars films are returning . It was a blockbuster: The original cast members in 1977's Star Wars . Though it was reported on April 10 by The Hollywood Reporter that Maisie Richardson-Sellers could land the female lead in Star Wars VII, that role went to Ridley, a newcomer who has made mostly shorts films and popped up in only a few TV shows. After the announcement was made, Ridley tweeted: 'Overwhelmed by all the support. This is the greatest day of my life. I'm told I can't say who I'm playing yet, but it's exciting!' Domhnall is a Tony Award nominee who played Bill Weasley in Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2. Serkis has appeared in Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes and the Lord Of The Rings films. Von Sydow got an Oscar nomination for his work in Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. She became a pinup thanks to the franchise: Carrie as Princess Leia in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI - Return Of The Jedi (left) and with Mark, who played Luke Skywalker, in the first Star Wars movie (right) Ever since the film was announced in November, it has been reported that many of the original cast members would make cameos. It wasn't until Tuesday that it was finally confirmed that Harrison, aged 71, Mark, aged 62, and Carrie, aged 57, would definitely be back. It was reported in March that Peter, aged 69, would reprise his role as Chewbacca. The movie will hit theaters on December 18, 2015. In March, Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger said the new project would begin filming in May and will be set 30 years after the events in 1983's Return of the Jedi. The new faces: Girls star Adam Driver (left), British TV actress Daisy Ridley,  (center) and John Boyega from Brit film Attack The Block and the forthcoming 24: Live Another Day, (right) are joining the veterans for the relaunch . The Star Wars team is thrilled to announce the cast of Star Wars: Episode VII. Actors John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, and Max von Sydow will join the original stars of the saga, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Kenny Baker in the new film. Director J.J. Abrams says, 'We are so excited to finally share the cast of Star Wars: Episode VII. It is both thrilling and surreal to watch the beloved original cast and these brilliant new performers come together to bring this world to life, once again. We start shooting in a couple of weeks, and everyone is doing their best to make the fans proud.' Star Wars: Episode VII is being directed by J.J. Abrams from a screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan and Abrams. Kathleen Kennedy, J.J. Abrams, and Bryan Burk are producing, and John Williams returns as the composer. It has previously been reported that . Abrams was planning to cast unknowns in the new film, following in the . footsteps of George Lucas's 1977 cast. Prior to the announcement on Monday, Disney CEO Bob Iger had only revealed the return of one fan favourite. 'Rumour has it that almost every actor . in the world has been cast in this movie, but so far, the official cast . member that we've confirmed - the only one - is R2D2,' he said. 'There will be some very familiar faces along with a trio of new young leads.' Rounding out the cast: Oscar Isaac (left) and Domhnall Gleeson (right) will take on smaller roles for the movie that starts shooting in May . Headed to London: Andy Serkis (left) and Max von Sydow (right) will reportedly film their scenes at Pinewood Studios . In early April it was revealed that some of the footage was already captured for the highly anticipated reboot. 'We're actually shooting some of it now. We're up against it,' Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn  said. And while . acknowledging that casting had been the 'toughest' part of the process, . Horn admitted there had been problems with perfecting the film's . script. 'It’s all about the screenplay,' he said. 'It has to be screenplay, screenplay, screenplay.' More vets back for fun: Peter Mayhew, who plays Chewbacca (left), Kenny Baker, the man in the R2D2 unit (center), and Anthony Daniels, who made C3PO a hit (right), have signed on as well . The stayed close: The main cast members in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI - Return Of The Jedi . When quizzed whether the script was ready, Horn said: 'It actually is now.' He confirmed the final draft was written by . Lawrence Kasdan and JJ Abrams from an early effort by Michael Arndt. Kasdan co-penned The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi. The movie will reportedly primarily be shot at London's Pinewood Studios. Deadline reported that Harrison’s Han Solo character will be making far more than a cameo appearance and will in fact have a ‘gigantic’ role in the seventh episode. Little else is known about the plot at this point, although Disney was said to be loosely using an original plot by Lucas, who is creative consulting, as an outline. The people behind the scenes: Director JJ Abrams (left), Lucasfilm producer Kathleen Kennedy (center) and producer Bryan Burke (right) Shooting in a place far, far away: Alec Guinness and Mark Hamill in the original Star Wars with R2D2 and C3PO; the new film will reportedly shoot in Abu Dhabi . Central to the plot: According to Deadline, Ford's Han Solo (left) will have a big impact on Abrams' version of Star Wars as will Hamill's Skywalker (right) The plot is being speculated as Disney LucasFilm’s Kathleen Kennedy recently announced that the narrative will not be a pre-existing, one such as those in comic books that continued the story. ‘In order to give maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers and also preserve an element of surprise and discovery for the audience, Star Wars Episodes VII-IX will not tell the same story told in the post-Return of the Jedi Expanded Universe,’ she said in a statement. ‘While the universe that readers knew is changing, it is not being discarded. Creators of new Star Wars entertainment have full access to the rich content of the Expanded Universe. The 'walking carpet' is back too: The cast of the 1977 film with Chewbacca, played by Peter Mayhew . The cast: . Anthony Daniels: 'Apologies to all those fans at Calgary Expo who asked me about Ep VII. Keeping the secret in front of y'all was the hardest act I ever did.' John Boyega: 'Honoured to join this amazing universe and thank you for all the support ....May the force be with you #SWVII' Daisy Ridley: 'Overwhelmed by all the support. This is the greatest day of my life. I'm told I can't say who I'm playing yet, but it's exciting!' Other stars' reactions: . Josh Gad: 'I can't deal. It's actually happening. Geeking out.' Mike Shinoda: 'If you guys are wondering where I am, I'll be in line for Star Wars tickets from now until it comes out.' Kyle Newman: 'Classic. Classy. @starwars Cast.' Matt Berry: 'Congrats to Daisy Ridley for her Star Wars role. You need to realise that this is purely due to her appearance in Toast Of London last year.' Chris Gore: 'BREAKING! Donald Sterling cast as bartender who says, ""We don't serve your kind here,"" in Star Wars VII.' Rob Delaney: '@starwars If Jar Jar's not in it, I'm not seeing it. #IStandWithJarJar.' ‘For example, elements of the EU are included in Star Wars Rebels. The Inquisitor, the Imperial Security Bureau, and Sienar Fleet Systems are story elements in the new animated series, and all these ideas find their origins in role-playing game material published in the 1980s.’ With Han apparently being featured heavily, the original idea that the script would focus on his children with Leia has slowly been squashed to leave the suggestion that Luke, Leia and Han will remain the central characters. It is expected that another big announcement regarding the movie will take place on May 4, which is known to fans as Star Wars day. Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor starred in the prequel Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999).

"Spanish retailer Mango has come under fire for selling a shirt decorated in lightning bolts that resemble an insignia worn by the SS and Hitler youths in Nazi Germany. Twitter users, especially those in Germany, were up in arms after they spotted the resemblance, noting that the tiny black zig-zag lines on the $59.99 blouse look just like the Siegrune, a symbol used by the Schutzstaffel or SS, the Nazi party's protection squadron, during World War II. Mango has since apologized, calling it an 'unfortunate association', but the criticism has continued to pour in. Scroll down for video . Anti-Semitic? Spanish retailer Mango has come under fire for selling a shirt decorated in lightning bolts that resemble an insignia worn by the SS, a Nazi organization in World War II . Negative associations: The Siegrune (pictured in a 1940 recruitment poster for the Waffen SS, a wing of the Nazi party) was a common symbol on Nazi uniforms and on Nazi flags . One Twitter user called the shirt an 'epic #design fail,' while another branded it 'Nazi chic'. A third person remarked: 'After Zara, the SS shirt by Mango,' referring to an incident in August, when Zara was forced to apologize for selling a striped T-shirt that appeared to resemble clothes warn by prisoners in Nazi concentration camps. 'The Spanish have a despicable way to promote brands. Antisemitism sells,' he continued. Others, however, were more skeptical of the similarity between the designs. 'LOL I see it but, really, it's a shirt,' said one person. Sorry: Mango has since apologized, calling it an 'unfortunate association'. A statement reads: 'The RAYO blouse belongs to a collection inspired by mini-motifs... there are two other models which feature hearts and stars' Offensive: Some critics sarcastically called the blouse 'Nazi chic' A stretch? Others, however, were more skeptical of the similarity between the designs . Another Twitter user wrote in German: 'Sorry but what's going on in your head that you see everywhere Nazi symbols? Hitler is not in Mango but in your heads!' More shoppers noted that if this shirt is considered offensive, the same can be said about the band Kiss's logo, or that of AC/DC. Mango has since apologized for any offence caused, stating in a release: 'The RAYO blouse belongs to a collection inspired by mini-motifs. In the range there are two other models which feature hearts and stars.' This isn't the first time a major retailer has been accused of selling apparel with anti-Semitic symbols; in October, Sears came under fire for featuring a ring with a Swastika on its Marketplace website.","Twitter users, especially those in Germany, noted that the tiny black zig-zag lines on the $59.99 blouse look just like the Siegrune, a symbol used by the SS, a paramilitary organization under Hitler and the Nazis .

"Harsh sentence: Editor Raif Badawi set up a liberal website in Saudi Arabia . The editor of a Saudi Arabian social website has been sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes for founding an Internet forum that violates Islamic values and propagates liberal thought, Saudi media reported on Tuesday. Raif Badawi, who started the 'Free Saudi Liberals' website to discuss the role of religion in Saudi Arabia, has been held since June 2012 on charges of cyber crime and disobeying his father - a crime in the conservative kingdom and top U.S. ally. Al-Watan newspaper said the judge had also ordered the closure of the website. France was concerned by the sentence . and remained committed to 'freedom of opinion and of expression', the . foreign ministry said in a statement. Officials from the Saudi National . Society for Human Rights could not be reached for comment. Badawi's . website included articles that were critical of senior religious . figures such as the Grand Mufti, according to Human Rights Watch. The . watchdog said in December that Badawi faced a possible death sentence . after a judge cited him for apostasy, but Al-Watan said the judge . dropped the apostasy charges. Apostasy, . the act of changing religious affiliation, carries an automatic death . sentence in Saudi Arabia, along with other crimes including blasphemy. Badawi's wife denied her husband had . expressed repentance before the judge on Monday at a court in the Red . Sea city of Jeddah. 'The judge asked Raif ""Are you a Muslim?"" and he . said ""Yes, and I don't accept anyone to cast doubt on (my belief)"",' she . wrote on Twitter. The world's top oil exporter follows the strict Wahhabi school of Islam and applies Islamic law, or sharia. Conservative: Badawi was found guilty of flouting Saudi Arabia's strict laws and sentenced to 600 lashes . Judges base their decisions on their own interpretation of religious law rather than on a written legal code or on precedent. King Abdullah, Saudi Arabia's ruler, has pushed for reforms to the legal system, including improved training for judges and the introduction of precedent to standardise verdicts and make courts more transparent. However, Saudi lawyers say that conservatives in the Justice Ministry and the judiciary have resisted implementing many of the changes announced in 2007.","Raif Badawi was accused of cyber crime and disobeying his father .

The AmazonFresh program offers same-day or next-day delivery on more than 500,000 items including fresh and frozen groceries. The firm said it will soon expand to other areas in Brooklyn, and the service is also available in Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Amazon.com is expanding its online grocery delivery program to Brooklyn's well-heeled Park Slope neighborhood in a bid to take on New York grocery stores and bodegas. The AmazonFresh program offers same-day or next-day delivery on more than 500,000 items including fresh and frozen groceries. It offe3rs everything from fresh fruit to washing powder. The firm also collects and delivers form local stores. The move is part of Amazon's slow build-out of its 'Fresh' program, targeting one of the largest retail sectors yet to be upended by online commerce. Amazon declined to say if it will expand to Manhattan or other parts of the New York metro area. 'Currently, we are offering AmazonFresh in Brooklyn and will continue being thoughtful and methodical in our expansion,' an Amazon spokeswoman said in an e-mail. Groceries have proven to be one of the toughest sectors for technology companies to manage, and Amazon faces competition from established companies like FreshDirect as well as fast-growing startups like Instacart. But a successful foray in Park Slope could help Amazon cement customer loyalty and boost sales, especially among wealthy and middle-class families, analysts have said. The top 10 to 20 percent of wealthiest Americans spend between 3 and 4 times more on food than the average American family, according to Bill Bishop, chief architect at Brick Meets Click, a consulting firm focused on retail technology. 'They are the sweetest of shoppers so anybody who attracts that business is taking the cream of the market,' Bishop said. A successful foray in Park Slope could help Amazon cement customer loyalty and boost sales, especially among wealthy and middle-class families, analysts have said. Amazon could also use its Fresh program to experiment with its own delivery service, analysts have said. Amazon tested Fresh in Seattle for five years before adding Los Angeles and San Francisco in 2013. The New York metro area presents very different logistical challenges, including a much higher population density. Fresh will be offered for free to Brooklyn-based members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime program through the end of the year. After that, Amazon will charge $299 a year for its 'Prime Fresh' program, which combines grocery delivery with free two-day shipping and other perks of Prime.","Service rolling out in Park Slope area of Brooklyn .

"Labour's public health spokesman Diane Abbott says there is a culture of 'sexting, slut-shaming and striptease' in British schools . Children are being seriously damaged by the ‘pornification’ of British culture, a senior Labour figure will warn today. Shadow public health minister Diane . Abbott will admit that the notion that overt, public displays of . sexuality were ‘enlightened liberation’ was wrong – and has instead . created a ‘prison’ for a generation of young women. Following yesterday’s warning by the . Prime Minister’s new childhood guru Claire Perry that parents must . challenge children about their text and internet messages, Miss Abbott . will agree there is a pernicious culture of ‘sexting, slut-shaming and . striptease’ in British schools. Parents are ‘struggling to cope’ and . need help to block inappropriate content on the internet and mobile . phones, she will say, adding: . ‘We need to start a national conversation . between parents and their children about sex, pornography and . technology. ‘For so long, it’s been argued that . overt, public displays of sexuality are an enlightened liberation. 'But I . believe that for many, the pressure of conforming to hypersexualisation . and its pitfalls is a prison. And the permanence of social media and . technology can be a life sentence.’’ The Labour frontbencher’s . intervention, in a speech to the Fabian Women’s Network, suggests an . emerging political consensus on the need for radical thinking on the . commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood. In yesterday’s Daily Mail, Mrs Perry, . appointed by the Prime Minister as his adviser on the issue last month, . set out a range of proposals including better systems for parents and . children to report inappropriate behaviour online, restrictions on . access to sexually explicit music videos and ‘lads’ mags’, and better . teaching of internet safety in schools. Most controversially, she insisted . parents should challenge the culture of ‘children’s rights’ which . suggests they should be able to communicate with friends and strangers . online or by text in private. Miss Abbott will today agree that parents must be put ‘back in control’. ‘I want to highlight what I believe is . the rise of a secret garden, striptease culture in British schools and . society, which has been put beyond the control of British families by . fast-developing technology, and an increasingly pornified British . culture,’ she will say. ‘There’s something wrong with a . society as a whole when children say they have no-one to turn to for . advice because their parents – outwitted by technology, and struggling . to juggle work and home life – don't really know what's going on. ‘There’s something wrong with a . society when many young girls of all classes are pressurised into . exposing themselves online, and are then humiliated. ‘There’s something wrong with a . society when most children say their sex education is out-of-touch, . irrelevant and too little too late. And where boys end up turning to . hardcore online pornography to teach them what they think they need to . know. Many young girls are being forced to conform to hypersexualisation (picture posed by model) ‘There’s something wrong with a . society that normalises children of every background “sexting” from . their bedrooms. There’s something wrong with a society that sells . T-shirts for little girls emblazoned with ""future porn star"", and when . padded bras, thongs and high heeled shoes are marketed and sold to . children. ‘There something wrong with a society . that has gangs of disenfranchised young men who use rape and sexual . assault as the weapon of choice.’ Miss Abbott will reject the idea that . she is ‘hankering after some rose-tinted picture of childhood’. She will . insist: ‘Do we really have to just accept things as they are?  As . parents we're told - often by our own kids - that we've just got to live . with it - that the world has changed. 'But I don’t think we should . simply throw our hands up and accept the world – and the all-consuming . market - as it is. ‘We need to talk about how we put . families, and not the lowest common denominator of the market, back in . control.  We’ve got to build a society based on open-minded family . values, and not ‘anything-goes’ market values. ‘Parents and teachers have a duty to . ensure that children develop a healthy view of sexuality, distinct from . this porn version that is swamping and infiltrating British life. 'Because it’s a very specific form of sexuality that’s being imposed, on . children and adults: a porn version. This is what kids are dealing with . on a daily basis. ‘Young people are accessing far harder . pornographic images than ten or 15 years ago. We have to ask, does that . influence what they themselves put out on the internet?’ Miss Abbott will say that while most . parents would not allow their children to watch an 18-rated film, they . are often ‘powerless’ when it comes to what they access online and by . mobile phone. ‘I think one of the symptoms of the . culture that has grown is that young girls and women are subject to . ""slut shaming"" and sexual bullying in schools. ‘It’s hypersexualized British culture . in which women are objectified, objectify one another, and are . encouraged to objectify themselves; where homophobic bullying is . normalised; and young boys’ world view is shaped by hardcore American . pornography and other dark corners of the internet,’ she will say. David Cameron's new childhood guru, MP Claire Perry wants parents to ask their children about their text messages . Labour is calling for a ‘sex education . revolution’ in schools – with lessons focused on ‘preparing young . people to form healthy, respectful, emotionally fulfilling . relationships’. Miss Abbott will also say it must be ‘easier for parents to block adult and age-restricted material across all media’. ‘Internet users should have to make an . active choice over whether they allow adult content or not. We must . look at ‘child friendly’ computers and mobile phones where adult content . is filtered out by default,’ she will say . Mrs Perry told the BBC’s Daily . Politics: ‘Parents are feeling a powerlessness about their kids’ lives. When we were growing up, if someone was phoning our houses or sending . letters to the home, parents would feel they had a responsibility to . intervene. ‘Somehow we have kind of ceded that responsibility. We feel a nervousness about becoming involved in our kids’ online lives. ‘I’ve got three children – it’s not an . easy thing to do. Of course children should have privacy in childhood, . but we have exposed them to third party dangers and almost become . complicit in that. ‘We are usually paying for these . mobile phone contracts and devices. Haven’t we got a responsibility to . monitor what’s going on? We need a return to common sense.’ Nick Pickles, director of the Big . Brother Watch campaign group, insisted there was ‘total lack of . evidence’ to support what he branded Mrs Perry’s ‘Mary Whitehouse 2.0 . campaign’. ‘Parenting is dependent on a . relationship of trust, and spying only undermines the parent-child . relationship. Whether reading a diary or reading a text message, privacy . is not something to be brushed aside in a wave of hysteria and cheap . headlines,’ he said.","Shadow health minister Diane Abbot claims public displays of sexuality crate a 'prison' for young girls .

"A teacher who told police he thought it was legal to view child abuse images in private has been thrown out of the profession. Mark Edwards-Jones, 59, was found with more than 200 images of child pornography after his internet service provider noticed he was downloading indecent images and alerted police. When officers swooped on his home in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, the Year Ten teacher - who has now been banned from ever teaching again - tried to delete some of the pictures as police searched his home, a tribunal heard this week. Teaching industry body the National College for Teaching and Leadership heard that Edwards-Jones later told officers that he thought it was within the law for a teacher to view child abuse images in their own home. Lifetime ban: Year Ten science teacher Mark Edwards-Jones, 59, who said he thought it was legal to view child porn at home, has been barred from the profession (file image) Edwards-Jones, a science teacher at the Park Education Support Centre in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, taught Year 10 pupils aged between 14 and 15. Luke Graham, panel chairman, said the nature of Edwards-Jones' crime was 'fundamentally incompatible with being a teacher'. 'Mr Edwards-Jones has shown no remorse, nor recognised the wider impact of his actions on children', Mr Graham said. 'Despite the training he received in relation to child protection, he still continued to possess and access indecent images of children. 'He also failed to recognise that his actions were wrong and, at various times, has sought to justify that his actions were legitimate'. Officers had swooped on the man's home in Hertfordshire in September 2010, where 218 child porn images were discovered across three of his computers. The following year, Edwards-Jones pleaded guilty to possessing an indecent photograph or pseudo photograph of a child at Wood Green Crown Court in north London. He was handed a supervision requirement for two years, told to participate in a sex offenders’ treatment programme, and put on the sex offenders' register for five years. Wood Green Crown Court: The teacher pleaded guilty to possessing child porn at this north London court . This week, the tribunal barred the teacher from ever practising again. Mr Graham said: 'We are satisfied that Mr Edwards-Jones' actions were deliberate, as evidenced by the number of images, the number of computers and his attempts to delete images. 'We conclude that a prohibition order is necessary in order to protect members of the public, and in particular children, to maintain public confidence in the teaching profession and to declare and uphold proper standards of conduct. 'We consider, therefore, a prohibition order is proportionate'. Edwards-Jones, who did not attend the hearing in Coventry,now cannot teach at any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children’s home in England and cannot reapply for registration. He has 28 days to appeal the decision.","Mark Edwards-Jones, 59, was a Year Ten science teacher in Potters Bar .

"Two ‘despicable’ sex predators who raped a woman after she fell asleep on a night bus have been jailed for a total of 18-and-a-half years. Pakistani students Rizwan Ahmad, 24, and Hassan Siddique, 19, targeted the 20-year-old as she made her way home from a night out in central London. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard how Siddique got off the number 55 bus while Ahmad began chatting to the woman when she realised she had missed her stop. 'Despicable': Rizwan Ahmad, 24, (left) and Hassan Siddique, 19, have been jailed for a total of 18-and-a-half years and could face deportation . Ahmad persuaded her to get off at the next stop and said he would call her a taxi. He then phoned Siddique, a student at the London College of Business Management and Information Technology, to summon him to the scene. The two men lured their victim down a secluded alleyway off Leabridge Road in Leyton, east London, and took turns to rape her in the early hours of June 4 last year. During their trial Ahmad and Siddique insisted their victim had encouraged them, but the jury found both defendants guilty of rape and attempted rape. Judge Tudor Owen said he believed the pair should be kicked out of Britain once they have served their jail terms, adding: ‘The sooner you are deported from this country, the better.’ In an impact statement the victim said the attack will ‘stay with her for the rest of her life’. But she is determined to ensure her ordeal does not dictate her future. Sentencing, Judge Owen told the two rapists: ‘What you did was despicable. Your story was simply ludicrous. ‘You claimed she instigated the whole thing, that it was she who wanted to engage in sexual activity with you. ‘Unsurprisingly, the jury rejected your account. Opportunistic: Ahmad struck up a conversation with his victim after she fell asleep on a London night bus and missed her stop . ‘Women travelling alone at night are entitled not to be accosted in the way you two did. ‘She had a lot to drink but that does not mean she should have been treated in the way she was. ‘She was an easy target because she was so drunk. ‘She is now frightened of travelling alone at night, this has damaged her life.’ Jailing Ahmad for 10 years, and Siddique for eight-and-a-half years, Judge Owen added: ‘If it is necessary I will recommend most strongly that you are deported at the conclusion of your sentence.’ Ahmad, of Spruce Hills Road, Walthamstow, east London, and Siddique, of Gainsford Road, also in Walthamstow, denied rape and attempted rape. Judge Owen commended investigating officer Detective Constable Jonathan Concanon for his part in bringing the rapists to justice. The detective, of the Metropolitan Police’s specialist sex crime unit Sapphire, said: ‘Ahmad and Siddique demonstrated they are predatory offenders. They lulled the victim into a false sense of security before attacking her. ‘The victim showed immense bravery in coming forward and reporting this horrendous attack. I hope knowing her attackers are now behind bars will go some way towards allowing her to come to terms with what happened and to go on to have as fulfilling a future as possible.’","Pair told victim they would call her a taxi after she missed her stop, then lured her down an alleyway .

"Independent Melbourne musician Chet Faker didn't just win the top gong for his song, Talk is Cheap, in triple j's Hottest 100 for 2014 - he also scored the seventh and eight position in the top ten. But the real moment every music fan had been waiting for was whether US pop sensation Taylor Swift managed to sneak into the world's biggest music poll as rumours spread that the singer being banned from the annual countdown was part of a hoax. Despite the huge online campaign, #tay4hottest100, to include the American star's smash hit, Shake it Off,  in the prestigious countdown - the chart topper, who garnered so much support that her single was expected to be voted in at number 12, was disqualified due to her affiliation with KFC following triple j's strict policy on artists not benefiting from commercial ventures that could influence votes from fans. Scroll down for video . Independent Melbourne musician Chet Faker didn't just win the top gong for his song, Talk is Cheap, in triple j's Hottest 100 for 2014 - he also scored the seventh and eight position in the top ten . Taylor Swift was disqualified for a number of reasons, including KFC's decision to offer a $19.89 voucher, in reference to the pop stars latest album 1989. This violated Triple J's strict rules of entry . Although the award-winning artist didn't quit make the cut, Australian electronic music duo, Peking Duk, bagged two top five positions with High (featuring Nicole Millar) landing second place and Take me over (featuring Safia) in fifth spot. 1. Chet Faker - Talk is cheap . 2. Peking Duk - High (featuring Nicole Millar) 3. Hilltop Hoods - Cosby Sweater . 4. Milky Chance - Stolen Dance . 5. Peking Duk - Take me over (featuring SAFIA) 6. Mark Ronson - Uptown Funk (featuring       Bruno Mars) 7. Chet Faker - Gold . 8. Chet Faker - 1998 . 9. Sia - Chandelier . 10.Asgeir - King and Cross . While Australian hip hop band, Hilltop Hoods, who got their big break thanks to triple j's early support, came third with their single, Cosby Sweater. The other two songs by Faker that were voted into the top ten were Gold, at seventh place with eighth spot going to 1998. Before the music countdown began, there was a drum roll and Triple J's Lewi McKirdy announced that Taylor Swift will not be appearing in this year’s list ‘for a whole range of reasons’. An article with a comprehensive explanation for the decision was put on the Triple J website, but very few are privy to this information as the website crashed just a minute after it was posted. Daily Mail Australia viewed the post which is titled 'eight hilarious but totally true reasons you didn't hear Taylor Swift in the Hottest 100'. The humorous article, laden with sarcasm, has copied the format of the website 'Buzzfeed' which lead the #Tay4Hottest100 campaign. 'Their #Tay4Hottest100 campaign bought Taylor a one-way ticket to bansville,' a Triple J author wrote. Although they did wish to clarify, 'triple j doesn't have beef with Taylor Swift.' 'She's smart, she's cool and she has excellent taste in BFFs,' in reference to Swift's friendship with Lorde, who made numerous appearances in last year's Hottest 100 countdown. Australian electronic music duo, Peking Duk, express their gratitude on Instagram for bagging two top five positions on the Hottest 100 . The Triple J website crashed just a minute after a link was posted explaining the decision to disqualify Taylor Swift from this year's Hottest 100 . Before the music countdown began, there was a drum roll and Triple J's Lewi McKirdy announced that Taylor Swift will not be appearing in this year’s list ‘for a whole range of reasons’ However, they did point out that a Taylor Swift song was not played on Triple J at any point in 2014. The Triple J author explains that they took issue with the fact Buzzfeed, an international media company worth $850 million and the allegedly the leading source of cat GIFs, was 'throwing their weight around to influence a publicly voted music poll'. 'It's not legit for other media to try and troll the poll,' Triple J wrote. Triple J has strict rules which promise to 'remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them'. The article then points out the number of 'trolls' who voted for Taylor Swift to 'prod the hipsters for lulz', meaning they did not vote for the young muso because of a genuine interest in the countdown. 'Do we really want to be talking about this every year?' Triple J asked. They argue that if the Taylor Swift campaign was successful it would have a long-term impact on their music poll, with other campaigns inevitably set to follow in future years, supporting people like 'Rebecca Black, Crazy Frog and Paris Hilton'. That would be a 'sh***y, sh***y tragedy.' KFC were also pointed out as being partially responsible for their decision after the fast food chain launched a campaign endorsing the pop icon in the lead up to the annual Australia Day countdown. 'Not every KFC idea is a good one,' pointed out Triple J in their 'Triple J Feed' post. The fast food giant jumped on the frenzied social media attempt to include the starlet in the Triple J Hottest 100, a campaign which has sparked both waves of support and fury from polarised music lovers. The fast food chain offered a $19.89 voucher, in reference to the pop star's latest album 1989, to customers who posted their favourite Swift song- a move which may breach the countdown's strict policy of banning artists who give their fans incentives to vote. '""We'd prefer that people vote for the love of music, not the love of cholesterol"",' Triple J responded on Australian Day, hitting out at the fast food chain after they tried to cash in on the Hottest 100 hype. An article with a comprehensive explanation for the decision was put on the Triple J website, but very few are privy to this information as the website crashed just a minute after it was posted . triple j confirmed that the voucher was in direct violation of the Triple J Hottest 100 voting rules, which clearly state that the station will 'remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them'. While ABC declined to comment officially before the countdown, former Triple J announcer Angela Catterns told The Drum on Monday that Swift had been disqualified. Last week, unconfirmed rumours were rife that Taylor Swift had been disqualified because of this campaign. 'You probably know that there was a push to get a Taylor Swift song in (the Hottest 100), which has now been disqualified because a fast food chain became involved in the whole process,' Ms Catterns said. Following the announcment, Social Media was bombarded with posts – some celebrating the decision, others devastated by Swift’s exclusion. ‘Dear @triplej why do you hate joy and puppies and kittens and bubbles and good things YOU MONSTERS,’ wrote Aya Reina. ‘Is it too cliche to tell @taylorswift13 fans to shake it off?’ said Chris Matthews-Darby . ‘Now the people who were waiting for Taylor Swift, but have never listened to @triplej can go away now,’ said Ren. Almost in direct response, Dylan Malloch posted ‘So, @triplej just ensured I won't be listening to any of the #hottest100 this year by not including #taylorswift.’ Harsh: In retaliation, extreme alternative music fans with a penchant for violent threats then took to social media to intimidate Taylor supporters . The response to the potential blow KFC may have dealt to the #tay4hottest100campaign  has been as divided as the movement itself. 'Thank you KFC!!! You just invalidated this song from being in the hottest 100 by commercially incentivising it!!!' said one Facebook user. 'I hope that was your plan all along this just made my day as now I know the hottest 100 wont be tainted by this rubbish'. 'You've ruined #Tay4Hottest100 KFC! Arrghh!!!' said another user. Other social media commentators were pleased with the seemingly unintended outcome. 'Fantastic. For the first time ever KFC has done something useful and gotten Taylor Swift disqualified from the hottest 100,' said one Facebook user. 'if this is the reason swift gets disqualified from the hottest 100 then I hereby pledge to only eat KFC when I have that fast food craving....' said another. A spokesperson for KFC spoke out about the campaign, denying accusations of 'incetivising' people to vote for Taylor Swift in the Hottest 100. 'We know many of our fans are music lovers and our recent post has caused a bit of a stir so to avoid any more confusion we have removed the post.' 'The post simply asked our fans to tell us what their favourite Taylor Swift song was for the opportunity to win a voucher, we were not incentivising people to vote for the Hottest 100. Earlier on Tuesday, an unofficial poll shed some  insight into who might take home the coveted Triple J Hottest 100 crown, with Swift making the cut despite the controversy. Taylor Swift was given a number 75 ranking on the Social Hottest 100 which has proved an inaccurate prediction, many hipsters nationwide may well hurl into fits of rage come Australia Day when the ABC radio station's annual alternative music poll hits the airwaves. Nasty: 'I hope you die a slow, painful death,' one wrote to a voter, while another compared a fan to ISIS .

"Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz told a cheering crowd of conservatives Saturday night that the next U.S. president should shutter the much-maligned Internal Revenue Service and turn the agency's 110,000 employees loose to police the U.S.-Mexico border. 'That's slightly tongue-in-cheek,' he said in Denver at the Western Conservative Summit. 'But think about it for a second: You travel thousands of miles, you cross over and see 110,000 IRS agents? You'd turn around and go home!' His speech before a partisan crowd of hooting and hollering Republicans was the main draw at a conference that brought an estimated 3,500 to hear pols including former VP candidate Sarah Palin, U.S. Sen. Mike Lee and rising right-winger Dr. Ben Carson. Cruz delivered a speech full of anti-Obama barbs Saturday night, touching on immigration, education, foreign policy and religious freedom . Thousands came to Denver, the site of President Obama's 2008 presidential nomination, cheering for the man they hope will win the White House in 2016 . But Cruz brought down the house with a speech that sounded as much like practiced campaign stumpery as a laundry list of grievances with Barack Obama's administration. The normally stolid and bloated GOP establishment, Cruz hinted Saturday, is dismayed at his rise to prominence among tea party sympathizers and other grass-roots conservatives, and he wore his outsider status like a badge of honor. 'I spent most of the week back in Washington, D.C.,' he began. 'So it's great to be back in America.' Cruz described American politics as a cross between 'poly, meaning many, and tics, meaning blood-sucking parasites.' His biggest applause line: 'If you see a candidate that Washington embraces, run the other way.' He called for the abolition of two conservative bugaboos – Obamacare and the Common Core education standards. 'Education is too important to be left to bureaucrats in Washington,' said Cruz. 'Besides, we already have a ""common core"" in this country: It's called the Constitution of the United States.' But the Texan reserved a special brand of ire for the Obama administration's management of America's southwest border, where more than 90,000 unaccompanied children from Central America will have streamed into the U.S. illegally by the end of the government's fiscal year on September 30. Fresh from a visit to a U.S. Border Patrol station in MacAllen, Texas, he said agents told him they apprehended 622 illegal immigrants on Friday at that location alone. 'That was yesterday,' he said. 'And roughly 25 per cent of those coming in are unaccompanied minors – little kids brought in by violent drug cartels.' When he asked his hosts why they thought the flood of immigrants were risking life and limb to make harrowing journeys northward, Cruz said, 'every single border patrol agent sitting in the room said the same thing: ""They're coming because the believe they will get amnesty"".' Cruz's prescription for what Obama has acknowledged is a 'humanitarian crisis' is to deport as many of the children back to their home countries as possible, and as soon as possible. 'The compassionate thing to do is, humanely and expeditiously, to reunite them with their families back home, so we don't have next year tens of thousands of little boys and little girls being victimized.' Animated: A high-energy Ted Cruz told reporters after his speech Saturday night that President Obama was to blame for providing families with an incentive -- immigration amnesty -- to send their children thousands of miles to the United States . With the children have come reports of sexual abuse, hostage taking, and worse. On . Saturday Cruz re-told anecdotes he has shared publicly before, . describing 'coyotes' – paid human traffickers – extorting money from . families in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and sending home body . parts of their children when they can't pay. In . some cases, he said, the coyotes threaten some children with instant . death if they refuse to cut off fingers and ears of others. 'The people who are bringing these kids are not well-meaning social workers in Birkenstocks with long beards,' he charged. 'These are vicious, hardened, transnational drug cartels.' Obamacare is a Republican hobby horse Cruz rides almost as much as immigration policy. On Saturday he ripped into the White House for pressing the position in court that religious organizations shouldn't be exempt from the health insurance law's requirement to cover abortion-inducing drugs as part of qualifying policies they offer employees. In one case wending its way through the judicial system, the Little Sisters of the Poor are opposing that mandate. ''Let me give you a simple rule of thumb,' he cracked: 'If you're litigating against nuns, you've probably done something wrong.' Rock star: In conservative circles, the 43-year-old Cruz is seen as the Barack Obama of 2016 and signs autographs wherever he appears in public . Near the end of his remarks, Cruz bulked up his arsenal of foreign policy critiques with broadsides about what he called Obama's 'return to Jimmy Carter.' The two presidents, he claimed, advanced 'the same feckless and naive foreign policy, making the world much, much more dangerous.' 'In the last five years we've seen America recede from leadership in the world,' said Cruz, 'and into that vacuum have stepped nations like Iran and Russia and China. And the world is a whole lot more dangerous place.' 'If there's one principle from time immemorial,' he said in a line that Republicans will likely hear in Iowa and New Hampshire, 'it is that bullies and tyrants don't respect weakness or appeasement.' 'And when you have the President of the United States being openly mocked by leaders of nations like Russia and Iran, it is profoundly dangerous.' In one momentary lapse that seemed almost scripted, Cruz transposed Obama and President Ronald Reagan, putting the former in Berlin in April 1987 to challenge the Soviet Union. 'We all remember,' he said, 'when President Obama stood before the Brandenburg Gate and uttered the most important words uttered by any leader in modern times: ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall"".' After audience members in the front row told him what he had just said, he conceded that it was 'an interesting slip.'

"A Pennsylvania woman has been found guilty of downloading child pornography in a failed attempt to frame her estranged husband. Meri Jane Woods, of Clymer, was convicted Wednesday in Indiana County. District Attorney Patrick Dougherty says the 43-year-old Woods downloaded 40 images to the family computer, took it to police last August and blamed Matthew Woods for the material. But when police examined time stamps, they determined the images had been downloaded just three days earlier. Yet the ex-husband had been kicked out of the house some two weeks before, when Meri Woods had filed a protection-from-abuse order. Woods' attorney had argued the time stamps were unreliable. It only took the prosecution one witness, a police forensic investigator, to get a slam-dunk conviction. Woods will be sentenced in December on a felony charge of possession of child pornography and a misdemeanor charge of lying to police, the Indiana Gazette reported. She could received up to seven years in prison and a $15,000 for the felony, the paper reported. The misdemeanor could land her another two years behind bars and a $5,000 fine. Woods may be forced to register as a sex offender for up to 15 years, pending an evaluation by the state Sexual Offenders Assessment Board.

"New Jersey man Baer Hanusz-Rajkowski was stunned to receive a bill for nearly $9,000 when his local hospital fixed up a cut finger he hurt during some home DIY. Bayonne resident, Rajkowski, split his middle finger with the claw end of a hammer last August and was hit with the enormous charge by Bayonne Medical Center ER, despite only receiving a tetanus jab, swab and bandage. For that level of care, an incredulous Rajkowski was sent a bill for $8,200 for the visit to the ER and on top of that he was charged $180 for a tetanus shot, $242 for sterile supplies and $8 for antibacterial wipes - plus hundreds more for the nurse who treated him. Scroll Down Video . Incredulous: Baer Hanusz-Rajowski said the bill he got from Bayonne Medical Center was unbelievable . 'I got a Band-Aid and a tetanus shot. How could it be $9,000. This is crazy,' said Hanusz-Rajkowski to NBC New York. 'If I severed a limb, I’d carry it to the next emergency room in the next city before I go back to this place.' However, Dr. Mark Spektor, who is the President and CEO of Bayonne Medical Center said that the high bill was the fault of Rajkowski's insurance company, United Healthcare. The beginning of the problem was six years ago, when Carepoint Health purchased Bayonne Medical Center and made it a for-profit hospital. Expensive: This is the full extent of Rajowski's treatment on his left hand after cutting his middle finger during a DIY accident . Profit: Bayonne Medical Center charged the huge bill to Rajowski and his insurance company . Then Carepoint did not renew the in-network pricing contracts it had with United Healthcare. This mean that Rajkowski's bills was enormous because United does not offer reimbursement rates. 'These sticker price charges only apply to ... a minority of patients whose insurance companies have refused to negotiate fair contracted prices with us,' said Spektor to NBC. However, Mary McElrath-Jones, who works for United Healthcare said that Carepoint is simply trying to make money. 'United Healthcare is deeply concerned about hospitals establishing an out-of-network strategy to hike the rate they charge for emergency room services, often surprising patients,' said Jones to NBC.

'Our members are very frustrated at receiving these egregious hospital bills so we are working to curtail outrageous billing and to help provide affordable healthcare options for our members.' Spektor told NBC he would reveal the profit margin on Rajkowski's $8,200 hospital visit. However, Linda Schwimmer, who is the vice president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute said that Bayonne charged almost ten times the going rate. 'I can tell you the right price is somewhere between the neighborhood of $400 and $1,000,' said Schwimmer to NBC. 'And I know that because I’ve called around and asked, but why doesn’t everybody know that?' United Healthcare has settled its portion of the bill, about $6,640.

"Duty of care: Dr Leila Denmark kept working as a doctor until she was 103 . The world's oldest doctor, who retired when she was 103-years-old after 70 years of practicing medicine, has died. Dr Leila Denmark was 114 when she passed away at her home last Sunday in Athens, Georgia. Dr Denmark became the first resident physician at Henrietta Egleston Hospital for Children in Atlanta when it opened in 1928, said her grandson Steven Hutcherson. She also admitted the first patient at the hospital which was now part of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. She . loved helping children and it showed in the way she would turn to the . next family waiting to see her, according to Mr Hutcherson. 'She would say, ''Who is the next little angel?,""' he said. Dr Denmark began her pediatrics practice from  home in Atlanta in 1931 and continued until her retirement in 2001 - 70 years later.

She was also the world's . fourth-oldest living person when she died. Throughout her career, Dr Denmark always . kept her office in or near her home, where children and their parents . would show up at all hours in need of care. Her . grandson said: 'The kids would come in and she would spend as much time . as she needed with the parents to help fix that baby or that child.

"After having leveled huge swathes of New York City and the East Coast as it rampaged through the region on Monday night, superstorm Sandy inflicted a final indignity as it caused coffins to rise from their graves. At one cemetery in Crisfield, Maryland, two caskets, one silver and the other bronze, rose up from the ground as the sheer force of the water unleashed by Sandy swelled the ground. Powerful enough to dislodge the cement slabs that covered the graves, the sad sight indicated the indiscriminate bombardment that mother nature brought to reign over the U.S. Atlantic coastline. Scroll down for video . Coffins have risen out of the graves in which they were placed in Crisfield, MD, after superstorm Sandy struck . The most devastating storm in decades to hit the country's most densely populated region upended man and nature as it rolled back the clock on 21st-century lives, cutting off modern communication and leaving millions without power as thousands who fled their water-damaged homes wondered when, and if, life would return to normal. Superstorm Sandy killed at least 50 people, many hit by falling trees, and still wasn't finished. It inched inland across Pennsylvania, ready to bank toward western New York to dump more of its water and likely cause more havoc last night. Behind it: a dazed, inundated New York City, a waterlogged Atlantic Coast and a moonscape of disarray and debris - from unmoored shore-town boardwalks to submerged mass-transit systems to delicate presidential politics. 'Nature,' said New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, assessing the damage to his city, 'is an awful lot more powerful than we are.' More than 8.2million households were without power in 17 states as far west as Michigan. Nearly two million of those were in New York, where large swaths of lower Manhattan lost electricity and entire streets ended up underwater - as did seven subway tunnels between Manhattan and Brooklyn at one point. The New York Stock Exchange was closed for a second day from weather, the first time that has happened since a blizzard in 1888.

The shutdown of mass transit crippled . a city where more than 8.3million bus, subway and local rail trips are . taken each day, and 800,000 vehicles cross bridges run by the transit . agency. Images from around the storm-affected areas depicted scenes reminiscent of big-budget disaster movies. In Atlantic City, New Jersey, a gaping hole remained where once a stretch of boardwalk sat by the sea. In Queens, New York, rubble from a fire that destroyed as many as 100 houses in an evacuated beachfront neighborhood jutted into the air at ugly angles against a gray sky. In heavily flooded Hoboken, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, dozens of yellow cabs sat parked in rows, submerged in murky water to their windshields. At the ground zero construction site in lower Manhattan, seawater rushed into a gaping hole under harsh floodlights. One of the most dramatic tales came from lower Manhattan, where a failed backup generator forced New York University's Langone Medical Center to relocate more than 200 patients, including 20 babies from neonatal intensive care. Dozens of ambulances lined up in the rainy night and the tiny patients were gingerly moved out, some attached to battery-powered respirators as gusts of wind blew their blankets. Airports were shut across the East Coast and far beyond as tens of thousands of travelers found they couldn't get where they were going. John F Kennedy International Airport in New York and Newark International Airport in New Jersey will reopen at 7am this morning with limited service, but LaGuardia Airport will stay closed, officials said. Sandy began in the Atlantic and knocked around the Caribbean - killing nearly 70 people - and strengthened into a hurricane as it chugged across the southeastern coast of the United States. By last night it had ebbed in strength but was joining up with another, more wintry storm - an expected confluence of weather systems that earned it nicknames like 'superstorm' and, on Halloween eve, 'Frankenstorm'. Atlantic City's fabled Boardwalk, the first in the nation, lost several blocks when Sandy came through, though the majority of it remained intact even as other Jersey Shore boardwalks were dismantled. What damage could be seen on the coastline Tuesday was, in some locations, staggering - 'unthinkable,' New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said of what unfolded along the Jersey Shore, where houses were swept from their foundations and amusement park rides were washed into the ocean.

"A Boston housing director who earned a hefty $360,000 salary and managed low-income housing only spent 15 days on the job this year. The rest of the year, Michael E. McLaughlin was travelling the country, doing business elsewhere, working remotely, or not putting in a full eight-hour workday. He served as one of the highest-paid public housing officials in the country, and yet took 47 days of vacation in 2011 alone, during a time of grim realities in the housing market. Cashing in: Michael McLaughlin earned $360,000 for 15 full days work, and cashed in for 'unused' vacation time . The Boston Globe uncovered cellphone records of Mr McLaughlin and pointed out that while he had claimed over $80,000 in ‘unused’ vacation time and sick time. He was only on-site in the low-income Chelsea neighbourhood of Boston for 15 days total in 2011. ‘The office was just a place (McLaughlin) stopped to delegate to everyone what to do,’ an anonymous housing authority employee told the Globe. The employee said that Mr McLaughlin would come in slightly before 10am and leave in the early afternoon, often around 1pm. 'These are disturbing allegations (that) further indicates that our efforts to remove the former executive director and board members were the right thing to do.' -Greg Bialecki, secretary of the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development . Mr McLaughlin resigned swiftly last month after his extraordinary salary and pitiful attendance was revealed. His work for the Chelsea Housing Authority was often spent in Maine and Florida, The Boston Globe reported. He claimed near-perfect health, only reporting 3.5 hours of sick time in more than a decade of work. On his last day of work, he wrote himself a $114,237 check which compensated him for the ‘unused’ sick time. Officials tried to claim the check, but he had already cashed it. Following his departure, the FBI is investigating whether or not Mr McLaughlin has illegally diverted federal funds. ‘These are disturbing allegations,’ Secretary of the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development said in a statement. Help for the hurting: Chelsea Housing Authority provides aid for low-income families and the elderly looking for affordable housing in the Boston area . According to their website, the authority administers two housing programs – rental assistance and public housing, both of which help low-income families find places to live. His deputy assistant and friend Linda Thibodau kept a similarly luxurious schedule, and didn’t show up to the Chelsea neighbourhood of Massachusetts that often. Ms Thibodau, who started working for Mr McLaughlin in 2001, was earning a padded wage for the amount of time she worked. Ten years later, she was earning $99,000, which included a 2009 stipend given to her by the board of directors for ‘added…duties,’ the Globe reported. She and Mr McLaughlin often visited Naples, Florida, but did not count it as vacation time, even though as little as a quarter of all calls made while in Florida were to the housing authority. Mr McLaughlin’s contract also allowed him to sell unused vacation and sick days back to the housing authority.","McLaughlin claimed over $80,000 in unused vacation .

"Professor Dame Sally Davies, who said workers with depression or anxiety should be fast-tracked for NHS treatment . Workers with depression or anxiety should be fast-tracked for NHS treatment ahead of pensioners and the unemployed with the same conditions, according to the chief medical officer. Professor Dame Sally Davies said the working days lost when men and women are off sick with mental health issues cost the economy £100 billion a year. She also urged employers to make it easier for staff who have been on long-term sick leave to come back to work by starting them off on reduced hours. Around 70 million working days are lost because of stress, anxiety and other mental health conditions each year, a rise of a quarter since 2009. But campaigners warned that her proposals risked discriminating against pensioners, stay-at-home mothers and the unemployed. They claimed that it would undermine one of the founding principles of the NHS, which is that it ‘provides a comprehensive service available to all’, promoting equality by focusing on patients’ clinical need rather than their personal circumstances. In a report published today, Dame Sally called on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the NHS watchdog, to weigh up the costs of allowing workers with depression or anxiety to be fast-tracked for treatment. ‘The costs of mental illness to the economy are astounding,’ she said. ‘I urge commissioners and decision-makers to treat mental health more like physical health. ‘Anyone with mental illness deserves good quality support at the right time. ‘One of the stark issues highlighted in this report is that 60 to 70 per cent of people with common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety are in work, so it is crucial that we take action to help those people stay in employment to benefit their own health as well as the economy.’ A spokesman for the Department of Health said it was likely that NICE would be in favour of such a policy. Dame Sally did not indicate whether full-time workers should be prioritised over those who work part-time. But it would follow that their costs to the economy would be far higher if they were off sick. However, Jenny Edwards, chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation said: ‘Whilst we recognise the benefit of good quality work to mental health we are concerned about the suggestion to focus the fast-tracking of care on people of working age who are at risk of falling out of work. ‘A health service that is free at the point of delivery should “fast-track” all and not discriminate in favour of those who are economically active. Around 70 million working days are lost because of stress, anxiety and other mental health conditions each year, a rise of a quarter since 2009 (file picture) ‘We consider that there must be an investment in establishing a suite of evidence-based solutions to mental ill health and support mental well-being, particularly targeted where there are the greatest inequalities.’ As many as 23 per cent of women and 16 per cent of men are suffering from depression or anxiety at any one time, according to NHS figures. It is thought the number of men with the conditions could be higher, because men can be less inclined to admit they have a problem and avoid seeing their doctor. Professor Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ‘We endorse the chief medical officer’s call for employment becoming a routine outcome indicator for mental health services – an outcome that has real world relevance and is simple to collect. ‘We also agree that more support is needed to keep those who are at risk of losing their jobs from joining the ranks of the long term sick.'","Dame Sally Davies says working days lost to mental health cost £100 billion .

"L'Wren Scott's grieving sister has criticised Mick Jagger for having the designer buried in Los Angeles and turning the funeral into a 'media circus'. Jan Shane said that no members of the family - apart from brother Randall - made the trip from their home in Utah to the private wake held at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Mrs Shane said she felt her sister deserved to be buried in Utah, where she was born and brought up, and that her family and friends from her home town of Ogden, in the state, were devastated at being kept out of the ceremony. 'Hijacked': L'Wren Scott's sister Jan Shane is speaking out against Mick Jagger, who she says has hijacked the late designer's final rites from her family in Utah . 'She has been away from home for so long, this is her place, not in some strange cemetery in Los Angeles. It has no connection,' said Shane (pictured left with her husband Rob at their Utah home) She said it was made especially hard that L'Wren was . cremated, meaning none of her family will ever get to say a proper goodbye. Mormons - Scott was brought up in the faith - generally have an opportunity to see the deceased in an open casket before the funeral, and although cremation is not forbidden, burial is more usual. The funeral was not held under the Mormon rite, blessings and prayers were led by the Rev Ed Bacon from the All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena. It is, however, the fact that the designer's last resting place is a Los Angeles cemetery that has upset Mrs Shane, a mother of eight, the most. 'It's become a media circus, it's so . not how Luann would have wanted it,' she said. 'All you read is how devastated he . is, well, he's not the only one. I don't get to see her, neither do her . family and the friends that she grew up with. We want to say goodbye, . but he's taken over. 'I hate to believe that it's become a showbiz, fake funeral': The Jagger family including Georgia May and Liz leave a reception for L'Wren Scott, following her funeral in Hollywood,California.  The reception was held at Sunset Towers hotel. Jan Shane called the funeral . 'She has been away from home . for so long, this is her place, not in some strange cemetery in Los . Angeles. It has no connection, but it's Mick and his kids that are . making all the decisions. 'He hijacked this funeral. Yes, he was with her for 13 years, but family is family, that's what it boils down to. 'She's . going to be alone there at this cemetery. I wish it had been handled . differently.  I hate to believe that it's become a showbiz, fake funeral . - she deserves more. She's a human being, she made a life that was . hers, not his. She deserves to be remembered for herself. 'She'll . be buried and passed away as Mick's girlfriend, not Luann Bambrough or . L'Wren Scott. It's so far blown out of proportion, she's a human being, . she deserves more.' Mrs Shane, 53, previously spoke before the funeral to disclose that she had been barred by her brother, Randall, from attending. The pair had fallen out over their mother's funeral arrangements in 2008. However Mrs Shane said it was not just her who had wanted to attend the ceremony for her sister, who was 49 when she died. 'I know there's a lot in the family . who couldn't travel,' she said. 'We've got a huge family in Utah, it's made it hard . for them to pay their respects. I've talked to cousins, they can't believe what Mick's done. 'There's . more wondering why she's not being brought her home. We'd all like to . see her next to mom and dad, that's what we believe. 'What . hurts the most is that I know how we were raised, the love we were . shown when growing up, and this isn't the way it's meant to happen.' Mrs Shane said she felt that the funeral had failed to be a dignified event. 'It's . really sad. She's not a thing that should be just paraded around,' she said. Snubbed: This family photo dated to the 1960s shows L'Wren, who was born Luann Bambrough (left), her older sister Jan (right) and brother Randall. According to Shane, only Randall attended the Hollywood funeral, which family was not invited to . Passed on: Another old family photo shows mother Lula and father Ivan . 'She's . a human being. It shouldn't be a paparazzi circus. Mick has taken over, . I can't compete with them, how can you? You can't compete with a . showbiz machine like the Jaggers.' The funeral was in fact attended by 70 people, including Jagger, his children and some of his grandchildren, and friends of the couple. They included Nicole Kidman, who had been a friend of Scott, and also frequently wore her designs on the red carpet, her husband Keith Urban, Eurythmics guitarist Dave Stewart, who played music, and fellow designer Ira M. Hammons-Glass and creative director Adam Glassman. However there . was no sign of Jagger's bandmates Keith Richards, Charlie Watts or Ron . Wood. Family and friends . also attended the reception at the Sunset Tower Hotel, about a nine . minute drive from the funeral home, following the service. Nicole Kidman was among the mourners at L'Wren Scott's funeral in Los Angeles. She was accompanied by her husband, Kieth Urban. Kidman and the designer had been friends for many years, and she often wore Scott's designs. Jade Jagger was present at the funeral for her father Mick's partner L'Wren Scott. The designer, 42, is heavily pregnant, and also due to become a grandmother. Her daughter Assisi is also pregnant but was not seen at the funeral. Last resting place: L'Wren Scott's funeral and cremation was at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Her family largely did not attend, although her brother had arranged the ceremony with Mick Jagger, her partner. The funeral is not the end of difficulties between Scott's family and her partner in the wake of her suicide earlier this month. The designer's will, published yesterday, disclosed that all her estate will be left to Jagger. The two had been partners for 13 years but had no children. But Mrs Shane said she will fight on behalf of her relatives to keep some personal items . away from the Jagger family. Speaking just before the will's contents became public, she said: 'I would assume she had a will, I'm not really sure. 'But I know . after mum passed away, L'Wren took pictures away from the family home. They were my childhood, I want them back, I hate to think they're gone . forever, it's our memories of growing up. The Jagger family doesn't need . them, they're our memories from our childhood. 'She . had things of mum's that have no use for anyone else, but there's some . nieces and nephews that would want them. I would like it kept in the . family, they don't need to be destroyed or given away.' Mrs Shane made her own act of remembrance at home at the same time as her sister's funeral in Los Angeles. 'I planted her favorite flowers in my . yard on Monday and that was from me to her,' she said, crying. 'They were her favorites - . blue pansies that she loved. I planted them in the front yard in . remembrance of her, so I had something. 'I can't argue with her being . cremated as that was her wishes, it just want it makes it even more . difficult to say goodbye. It's another twist, another thorn in the side.' Fighting for possessions: This image shows L'Wren and her family in 1992. Also pictured are L'Wren's father Ivan, brother Randall and sister Jan. The pictures were taken at L'Wren's parents 50th wedding anniversary. After their parents died, Jan says L'Wren took memorabilia that she fears may now end up with strangers . 'I know there's a lot in the family who couldn't travel,' said Shane. 'We've got a huge family in Utah, it's made it hard for them to pay their respects. I've not heard that anyone is going, and I've talked to cousins, they can't believe what Mick's done'","Jan Shane, sister to L'Wren Scott, criticised Jagger for holding the service in Los Angeles instead of Utah .

'It was a very realistic approach there (in Brazil).' He declined to give specifics of his likely team selections, noting that Van Gaal had brought in a crop of talented youngsters to mix with veteran stars such as Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben.

"From her outrageously tiny waist to . her unfeasibly long legs, the world's most famous doll has long been the . target of criticism from feminists and other women's groups who say it . promotes an unhealthy idea of body image in girls. Several artists have set about proving the public's claim by scaling the iconic doll up to human . size, to reveal her unrealistic measurements . compared to the average human girl. But now, in a role reversal, one artist has shown what Barbie would look like as the average 19-year-old girl and the results are surprising. Unhealthy Vs Healthy: Thanks to her ultra-slender measurements, it has been estimated that, if she were to exist as a human, Barbie would be anorexic - here she is pictured next to a Lammily doll . Artist Nickolay Lamm of MyDeals.com used the measurements of an average 19-year-old woman to create a 3-D model, . which he photographed next to a standard Barbie doll. Lamm then . photoshopped the 3-D model to make it look like a Barbie doll. In his previous research, Lamm found that, scaled up to human size, Barbie . dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36-18-33, compared with the . typical 19-year-old girl's 32-31-33. The average woman, meanwhile, has 38 inch back, a 34 inch waist and hips that measure 40 inches around, and Lamm's work shows that Barbie looks a lot more natural with these measurements.

'Furthermore, a realistically proportioned Barbie actually looks pretty good in the pictures I produced. 'So, if there's even a small chance of Barbie in its present form negatively influencing girls, and if Barbie looks good as an average sized woman in America. What's stopping Mattel from making one?'

"A teenager was banned from the classroom by his school because he had a haircut inspired by his footballing heroes. Thirteen-year-old Lewis Kenny copied Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero and Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale with his hairstyle, but teachers considered it too 'extreme'. The year nine pupil, who is mad about football and rugby league, was taken out of classes and put in 'isolation' for a day  by St Ambrose Barlow High School in Wardley, Salford. Lewis's parents – Liam, 49, and Angela, 50, from Worsley, Greater Manchester, had an emergency meeting with staff and have since made a formal complaint. Scroll down for video . Style clash: Thirteen-year-old Lewis Kenny copied Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero's hair - but teachers said it was too 'extreme' and put him in isolation . Mr Kenny said: 'What I want is an acknowledgement that they are wrong. They have said that he has an extreme haircut and he must restyle his hair to how the school wants it. 'The haircut is similar to Sergio Aguero and Gareth Bale and it's a modern haircut for a boy his age to have.' Last month his best friend, Jack Littlewood, also 13, was given the same punishment because his haircut – worn short said his family to stop his thick hair from becoming unruly – was considered in breach of school rules which state boys should wear their hair no shorter than a number three cut. Both boys arrived at St Ambrose Barlow in September following the closure of St George's High School in Walkden. Their parents say they have never been in trouble for their hairstyles before. Mr Kenny added: 'Lewis's hair is a number three cut and longer on top. 'It is a better look than long greasy hair. The school said they had spotted a line in his hair like the one worn by Aguero. But he only has a line put in the school holidays. 'He was upset to be placed in isolation and we are standing firm on this. It is disgraceful. 'We think it is victimisation.' Headteacher Marie Garside said: 'Both parents and pupils are made aware of our high expectations and aspirations before they choose the school. We are very clear about what we accept and don't accept and we make it explicit about what we feel are appropriate standards at our parent information evenings. 'Our staff work above and beyond the school day to make sure pupils work as well as they can and reach their potential.' Policy: Rules at the Salford school demands that boys should wear their hair no shorter than a number three cut . Heroes: Lewis, like many boys, adopt cuts like superstar Gareth Bale and others, but it is landing some in trouble . Not happy: Lewis' father Liam has had a meeting with the school and also made a formal complaint . School clampdowns on haircuts appear to be on trend, as schools consider several modern styles 'extreme'. This week two brothers were kicked out of classes at school and made to study in isolation because they have spiky haircuts. Keiran Matthews, 16, and his 13-year-old brother Callum, returned for lessons at Marches School in Oswestry, Shropshire, last week proudly sporting their new styles. But teachers branded their haircuts 'extreme' and took them out of their classes and placed them in isolation instead. They said that the style, which is closely shaved on the sides but spiky on top, broke school rules and their policy on uniform. Another extreme cut? Keiran Matthews and his brother Callum, who were both taken out of classes at school because they have spiky hair . The teens' father Tony, 44, told of his anger at the ban on the style, which is called the skinfade, as he says most children are sporting it these days. He explained: 'I understood the school has its policies that include hairstyles. 'But I’m just angry they seem to have been singled out'.","Lewis Kenny was put in isolation at Salford school by unhappy staff .

"As a boy Nick Clegg attended £30,000-a-year Westminster School, one of the most prestigious in the country. But his wife Miriam Gonzalez is unimpressed, revealing many people who go to the country’s top schools are ‘unimpressive’ and some are ‘absolutely hopeless’. In a rare interview, she insisted that success does not depend on having wealthy and bright parents or an expensive education but on effort and determination. Advice: Miriam Gonzales told girls from Basildon Upper School in Essex that going to a top school did not ensure success . The Deputy Prime Minister was nicknamed Clog by classmates at Westminster School classmates because his mother was Dutch. He has spoken of enjoying his time at the exclusive school, where former pupils also include singer Dido, actress Helena Bonham Carter, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and broadcaster Louis Theroux. However, Miss Gonzalez, a partner at global law firm Dechert, insists going to a top school is not a prerequisite for success and many who do struggle in the real world. Speaking to pupils at a National Inspiring Women campaign event, she said: ‘I come from a state education and what I have seen myself in life, whether you are looking at schools or groups of people or organisations, is that there is probably always the same proportion of absolutely amazing people, absolutely hopeless people and a lot of people in the middle. ‘That’s what we are trying to work on, that very simple concept that confidence should be linked to ability, not to your position in society,’ she told The Times. Miss Gonzales was joined at the event by David Cameron's wife Samantha (right table) Born in Spain, Miss Gonzalez grew up in the Valladolid region and attend what she describes as ‘not a particularly good school’. She later told the pupils:  ‘Some people from some of these top schools are fantastic but there are lots of people from these top schools who are unimpressive. ‘I know far too many that come out of there without speaking a single foreign language. ‘It doesn’t depend on your school, it doesn’t depend on your parents, it depends on you, how much effort and determination you are prepared to put in.’ Nick Clegg attended Westminster school in the 1980s, a short walk from the Houses of Parliament . Her advice to the girls was to ‘aim high, work as much as you can to get there and if at any point you wobble and you are not really sure if you are made for this, think of those women you have met today’. Old school friends of Mr Clegg say he was not a high fliwer. Harry Mount said last year: ‘Nick Clegg wasn’t one of the more intelligent boys when he was at Westminster School from 1980 to 1985. ‘The clever pupils at Westminster — one of the best, and most expensive, schools in the country, costing £32,490 a year — were ‘accelerated’. That meant they did O-levels after two, as opposed to three, years. ‘Clegg, one of the less bright sparks, was selected for the three-year option.’","Deputy Prime Minister's wife in swipe at people who go to private schools .

"African-American women have to eat fewer calories or take more exercise to lose the same amount of weight as Caucasian women . From their genes to the speed of their metabolism, people come up with an enormous range of excuses for their failure to shed their extra pounds. Now, new research suggests ethnicity could be a valid explanation for dieting disasters. Researchers discovered African-American women have to eat fewer calories and take more exercise to lose the same amount of weight as their Caucasian counterparts. Scientists at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine believe this is because they have slower metabolic rates. During their study, they found African-American women lost, on average, 7lbs less than Caucasian women on the same diet. Previous studies have shown that black women do not lose as much weight as white women when they diet. Dr James DeLany, associate professor at the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism at Pitt School of Medicine, explained: ‘At first, it was thought that perhaps the African-American women didn’t adhere as closely to their calorie prescriptions or that the interventions were not culturally sensitive. ‘But even in research projects that were designed to address those possibilities, the difference in weight loss remained.’ Dr DeLany’s team decided to see if there were metabolic reasons behind the discrepancy. They examined body weight changes, energy expenditure, physical activity and calorie intake in 39 severely obese African-American and 66 Caucasian women who were participating in a six-month weight loss programme. They measured body composition and daily energy expenditure at the beginning and end of the diet and assessed physical activity levels. The researchers found the African-American women lost about seven pounds fewer than the Caucasian women, even though their starting body mass index measures were comparable and they stuck as closely to the calorie restriction and exercise regime. African-American women have slower metabolisms than Caucasian women, meaning they find dieting harder . The African-American women had lower resting metabolic rates and expended less energy daily than the other group. ‘We prescribe how many calories are allowed and how much activity is needed during weight loss interventions based on the premise that people of the same weight have similar metabolic rates,’ Dr DeLany explained. ‘But to account for their lower metabolic rate, African-American women must further reduce the number of calories they eat, or use up more of them with exercise, in order to lose the same number of pounds in the same time span as a Caucasian woman of the same weight.’","This means they have to eat fewer calories or take more exercise to lose the same amount of weight .

"Huntress: Charisa Argys and the 175-pound male mountain lion she shot out of a tree while hunting in Colorado in February 2013 . A Colorado mother is being cyber-bullied by animals rights activists after she posted a picture online of her posing with a mountain lion she had killed. Beuna Vista resident, Charisa Argys uploaded the picture of her with the 175-pound male big cat in February - but one year later the photograph came back to bite her. Respected German journalist and animals rights activist, Silvia Wadhwa commented on a mundane picture of Argys's daughter and housecat recently by linking to the picture of the mountain lion - sending the photograph viral and sparking the vitriol. 'I posted a photo of my daughter with her recently adopted housecat on our local Humane Society Facebook page,' said Argys. 'The . next thing I knew, this Silvia person commented on and posted a link to . my personal page with a photo of my mountain lion. I have no idea how . she found me.' Argys . said that the comment in question referred to her mountain lion . photograph she uploaded last year and said, 'Sadly, you don't love ALL . cats, Madame.' The . photo was then reposted to animal rights groups and anti-hunting forums . such as the International Animal Rescue Foundation World Action - where . Argys received a barrage of criticism. Scroll Down for Video . Proud: Charisa uses the hunting trips with her father to bond and says that the kill of the mountain lion was her proudest moment . 'I have never been called so many horrible, hateful names in my life.' said Argys. 'They even went as far as to post my full name, address and directions to my house.' Buck: Charisa Argys was on the receiving end of death threats online after the picture of the dead mountain lion went viral . After this, Argys managed to get . World Action to remove the photograph and directions to her house, . however on forums across the Internet, the abuse remained. 'They . were calling me horrible names. They were saying they wanted to kill . me, they wanted to see me dead, they called me fat, they called me ugly, . they called me the B-word, they called me the C-word,' said Argys to CBS. 'There really wasn’t anything they weren’t willing to call me and to say. One comment reads, 'The only answer is to take out these psychopaths. Problem solved — animals saved.' Another comment calls for 'an eye for an eye.' And . another, 'You are a disgrace to those of us who respect life, human and . animal. I’d love to hunt YOU and hang YOUR head on my living room wall. 'You . know it was definitely cyberbullying. These were not just threats but I . would say they were terroristic threats,' said Argys. Indeed, . while World Action did remove the photograph, they did replace it with . an article about women hunters on their sister website, . speakupforthevoiceless. Threats: Charisa Argys spoke to CBS in Denver about the abuse she has been getting online for her February hunt . Viral: The campaign against Argys began when German financial journalist Silvia Wadhwa posted the picture to an animal rights forum . The article is specifically about women hunters and labels them as having 'antisocial personality disorder or sociopathology.' Argys said that she was appalled at the level of abuse she was receiving. Argys has been hunting since she was three and said that the hunt for the mountain lion that day was her best. 'I am very proud of what I had accomplished that day,' said Argys. Despite doing nothing illegal that day, Argys has been unfairly targeted according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesman Mike Porras. Early age: Charisa has been hunting since she was three-years-old with her father . 'You may not like hunting, we understand that. But there’s a right way and a wrong way to express your opinions,' said Porras to CBS. Argys said that she contacted Wadhwa to let her know the stress she had caused her. In reply, Wadhwa wrote that she cannot condone trophy killing, 'But I do not and will not ever condone or encourage insults, threats or death wishes.' Argys added she will not be intimidated by the online threats. 'If I don’t stand up for myself and I don’t take a position on what I feel passionate about how can I expect my children to stand up if it happens to them?' She also plans to keep hunting. 'It was an extreme hunt and it was well worth it,' said Argys.","Colorado mother has received death threats after a photograph of her and a dead mountain lion was shared by animal rights activists .

"For author Nancy Freund, raw chicken is coloured blue. Pain, of whatever variety, is orange, while different letters show up in different hues. Freund is one of the estimated four per cent of the population with synaesthesia, a neurological condition that makes sufferers see the world in vivid hues. Here, Freund, author of a semi-autobiographical new novel named Rapeseed that charts the adventures of a woman with the condition, reveals what living in a real-life rainbow is really like. Vivid: Author and synaesthete Nancy Freund sees pain as orange, chicken as blue and the letter A as yellow . 'Speaking about the condition, synaesthete Humberto C. Antunes once said: 'Synaesthesia is not a condition – it’s a super-power!  Like flying or throwing fire from the finger.' But I didn't know that growing up. I had never heard about synaesthesia, a condition that affects approximately four per cent of the population and turns letters and numbers into vivid colours. My ability to taste colour and even hear it made me different. But, as I was to discover, seeing the world through a kaleidoscope would prove to be a stroke of luck that would reverberate throughout my life. I was also nine when I started my first book – a thriller called The Orange Invasion in which lurid orange jelly beans attack a city simply by being orange. 'My parents loved the fact that their young daughter was writing a book, but they worried that the premise made no sense.  But it made sense to me. Incredible: Many blind people, among them Stevie Wonder, perceive the world around them in bright colour . Colourful world: Both Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga are reported to be among the synaesthete population . How could they not know that particular colour orange is violent? Seeing it inflicts pain – I tried to tell them: stomach aches, head-aches, dizziness, even vomit. Forty years later I have begun to understand synaesthesia – a neurological field of study that’s in its intriguing infancy. There are synaesthesia and neurology labs doing amazing research – Dr. David Eagleman’s program in Houston, Texas is one. There’s a sensory integration lab at the University of Edinburgh.  There are advancements being made at the University of London and the University of Sussex. It seems we may be on the cusp of solving important cognition issues of age-related dementia, Alzheimers, dyslexia, and improving knowledge retention for students. In my case, I’ve learned enough to know that orange does not inflict pain on most people – not even on most synaesthetes. Agonising: For author Nancy Freund, the colour orange is inextricably associated with feeling pain . Quirk: Although pink to most of us, raw chicken is blue according to Freund . Not everyone will agree with me that undercooked chicken is blue.  It doesn’t look blue - just the fact of it is blue. It’s a perception, not an actual visible colour, even in the mind.  I think it’s the texture and smell of raw chicken that’s blue – the sliminess, the soft gelatinousness of it.  The danger it represents, eating raw chicken, somehow in my mind’s eye, is just blue. Many blind people – including Stevie Wonder – are known to be synaesthetes, which makes sense when you exchange the word  ‘see’ for ‘perceive’. Evidently, his musical notes are perceived in colour – same as Lady Gaga and Pharrell Williams and Leonard Bernstein. So too, Tori Amos and  Duke Ellington.  Many creative geniuses in both visual and performing arts report synaesthetic experience – Vasily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Vincent Van Gogh, Vladimir Nabokov, Marilyn Monroe. But all synaesthetes are different.  The letter ‘a’ for one person is yellow and for another it’s blue, while some don't associate a colour associated with ’a' - even if the rest of their alphabet is in colour. Most people do not associate the colour of cream with the transitional moment of wakefulness to sleep, like I do. But as I finally made sense of synaesthesia, I was able to write my own synaesthesia novel that needed to be written. In ‘Rapeseed’ Carolann loses her virginity at age 17 in the back of a car in a powerful explosion of colours and smells and cross-wired senses. Gift: According to Nancy, seeing the world through a rainbow of bright colour is creative gift . She’s with her twin sister’s boyfriend, so add to all the sensory chaos, a big dose of guilt. Soon after, Carolann marries a man whose career later moves the family from Kansas to London, and she has to figure out who she really is – what her true colours are, you might say – to try to save herself, her marriage, and her family. Rapeseed is sort of a grown woman’s coming-of-age story, as she comes into an acceptance of herself, her colours, and smells and cross-wired experience. In Carolann’s case, synaesthesia is both a blessing and a burden. For most people I’ve interviewed it’s generally viewed as a gift. But even those who hear loud music or experience powerful phantom smells or must navigate through fogs of false vision -- even then, no one seems willing to lose it.'

"A concert violinist diagnosed with a tremor was able to help surgeons locate the exact spot in his brain to place an implant by playing his instrument during the operation. Roger Frisch, a concert master with the Minnesota Orchestra, was diagnosed in 2009 with essential tremors, a condition that occurs when sections of the brain that control movement start sending abnormal signals. Frisch’s condition was so mild that in many other line of work he might have been able to ignore it, but as a concert violinist it threatened his career. Scroll down for video . Roger Frisch, a concert master with the Minnesota Orchestra, was diagnosed in 2009 with essential tremors, a condition that occurs when sections of the brain that control movement start sending abnormal signals . Frisch underwent the operation in the Spring and since then has returned to his position as Associate Concertmaster with the Minnesota Orchestra . It took doctors a couple of years to determine Frisch's diagnosis and then or him to agree to the still experimental Deep Brain Stimulation procedure surgery. The surgery involved a tiny electrode being implanted into his brain, which doctors assured Frisch would enable him to control the condition at the flick of a switch. In order for the electrode to work, it had to be implanted in exactly the right position, reports EverydayHealth. Because surgeons can operate on the brain without the patient feeling pain, it enables them to see in real time if and how the tremor is responding as they place the electrode. Frisch's tremor was so mild that in many other lines of work he might have been able to ignore it, but as a concert violinist it threatened his career . Frisch now carries a device which allows him to turn his tremor off and on with the push of a button that controls the stimulator . Frisch’s tremor was so mild, however, that his surgeon was worried he would not be able to tell whether the electrode had been properly placed. Doctors then came up with the ingenious idea of using Frisch's violin bow to help determine where his tremor was. An accelerometer was place on the end of Frisch’s bow which translated his tremor into a graph on a computer screen that surgeons could watch. So while surgeons fitted the electrodes, he played his violin. Frisch underwent the operation in the Spring and since then he has resumed his position as Associate Concertmaster with the Minnesota Orchestra. He now carries a small device which allows him to turn his tremor off and on with the push of a button that controls the stimulator. Three weeks after brain surgery he was able to play in a full-length sextet performance and a week after that he was performing again with the orchestra. He told String Visions that the tremor is now 'nonexistent.'

"Manchester United have missed the boat for top midfield target Arturo Vidal, amid claims in Italy that they failed with a near-£30million bid for the Juventus powerhouse. Sources close to the Juventus board have told Sportsmail that the offer was made on Friday and that the answer from the Turin club effectively ended United's hopes of installing Vidal as the midfield general they so desperately need. Juve bosses informed United they had set an August 15 deadline for reaching any agreement over a deal for Vidal and that trying to negotiate so near to the transfer deadline would leave them insufficient time for recruiting an adequate replacement.

CLICK HERE to follow all the latest wheels, deals and steals with MailOnline's brilliant by-the-minute service, including breaking news, best pictures and videos. It represents a massive blow for manager Louis van Gaal, who wanted Vidal's energy and physical presence to revitalise a pedestrian-looking midfield. United were held to a goalless draw at Burnley on Saturday to leave Van Gaal still awaiting his first competitive victory in charge at Old Trafford. But the Dutchman was handed a major boost on Monday morning when United won the race to sign Radamel Falcao from Monaco on a one-year loan. Whole-hearted: Vidal's (centre) energy and passion are sorely needed in United's midfield . The striker will cost the club £12m for the year and the Colombia star follows Angel di Maria, Daley Blind, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo as United's new signings this summer.

'When we had that much possession, and you talk about two shots on target? 'We're not scoring a lot of goals, but we're not playing against teams who come out against us a lot.

'I was disappointed with the start of the second half when we didn't do anything as like as well for the first 15 minutes, but then we changed things, changed the formation slightly, and finished the game strongly.' Despite the criticism, the England manager hinted his side are unlikely to show more attacking verve against Switzerland in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier on Monday. 'Switzerland will need to beat us, if anything, we might be Norway on Monday,' said Hodgson. 'We might be pushed back and can't attack and dominate for long periods, as we did today. I don't know.

"Education Secretary Michael Gove has been accused of 'sitting on' warnings of a 'Trojan Horse' plots since 2010 . Education Secretary Michael Gove was accused yesterday of ‘sitting on’ four-year-old warnings that Muslim hardliners were attempting to take over Birmingham schools. Headteacher Tim Boyes said he cautioned the Department for Education (DfE) in 2010 about governors with a ‘disproportionate impact’ wanting to replace one sitting city head with a Muslim. He had described a ‘bloodless coup’ at one Birmingham school and ‘an alliance to destabilise the head’ at another – three years before a letter alleging a ‘Trojan Horse’ plot was sent to the council. Mr Boyes also highlighted ‘aggressive’, ‘intimidating’ and ‘highly organised’ governors that a primary headteacher believed were from a ‘co-ordinated group’ trying to exercise control over a school’s collective worship policy and other issues. The Department for Education has insisted that its meeting with Mr Boyes – head of Queensbridge School, Birmingham, was a ‘general policy discussion’. But Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary, Tristram Hunt, said Mr Gove was complacent and had failed to listen to warnings. Allegations emerged in early March about a so-called ‘Operation Trojan Horse’ plot by hardline Muslims to seize control of Birmingham schools. Ofsted has since launched inspections of 21 schools while Birmingham City Council and the government are also carrying out their own separate investigations. The DfE has appointed Peter Clarke, the former national head of counter-terrorism, to probe the alleged ‘Trojan Horse’ plot. Mr Boyes, whose school is not being inspected by Ofsted, told BBC News he gave the department a presentation about the threat in 2010. He said: ‘Back in 2010, I had a whole series of colleagues, other headteachers, who were reporting concerns about governance and things that weren’t going well in their schools. ‘Over 20 years…tensions and politics have exploded and as a result headteachers have had nervous breakdowns, they’ve lost their jobs, schools have been really torn apart.’ Slides from the presentation describe ‘staff and governors in an alliance to destabilise the head’ at one secondary school. The Park View School in Birmingham - which, according to whistleblowers, has been infiltrated by Islamic extremists who are attempting to change the school and target young people . ‘(A) member of staff (was) suspended, having tried to prove the head to be fraudulent.’ At another school it was claimed there was a plot to remove the head teacher, Mr Boyes said. The slide said: ‘Two governors with disproportionate impact... want to remove the head to have a Muslim head... (they are) working to undermine him. A known explicit intention the head lives with.’ At a primary school, a dramatic increase in interest in joining the governing body was described. Previously, it had been ‘hard to recruit a single parent’. ‘At the start of a new year four vacancies generate 13 nominations,’ Mr Boyes said. ‘The HT [headteacher] believed four to be from a specific co-ordinated group. Three were elected and the fourth came on as an LA (local authority) governor. This group were highly organised/nationally networked. 'Michael Gove refused to listen to the warnings about radical hardliners' ‘The focal point was collective worship and a parent/public meeting was called. This was aggressive, intimidating... issues spread to swimming, other curriculum areas, meals, uniform.’ Mr Boyes, one of about 800 national leaders of education, told BBC News he was not surprised the DfE did not act on his concerns. ‘What I think the solutions might be are in the absolute opposite direction to government policy,’ he said. ‘Because of the academy programme encouraging schools to opt out of local authority control, you’ve got increasing numbers of schools acting individually, on their own. ‘We have schools that have now become increasingly isolated and segregated.’ A DfE spokesman said: ‘Our records show this was a general policy discussion. There is absolutely no place for extremism in schools and this Government has taken a number of significant steps to combat it. ‘This meeting took place at the same time as the Department was enhancing our due diligence and counter-extremism capability to make schools more aware of risks and to protect children.’ But Tristram Hunt insisted the Government should have acted on the allegations. He said: ‘Michael Gove refused to listen to the warnings about radical hardliners taking control of schools. His department has sat on these warnings for four years . ‘This is gross negligence on the part of ministers. Michael Gove’s complacency has given rise to a constant stream of failings in our school system.’","Headteacher 'sent letter to the council warning of bloodless coup' in 2010 .

"Whether manufacturing shells or keeping the UK's railways running, the role played by women during the Great War was just as crucial as that of their successors in World War II. As these dramatic images reveal, British women took on jobs in munitions factories, drove ambulances, helped to keep the fledgling Royal Air Force in the sky and gave succour to wounded soldiers, both at home and on the battlefield. Perhaps the most famous of the VAD [Voluntary Aid Detachment] nurses was Katherine Furse, who later became commander-in-chief of the organisation, and came under fire during the Battle of the Marne in 1914. Impressive: Women war workers, including the distinctively white-capped and aproned VAD nurses, parade outside Buckingham Palace in 1918 . Pioneering: Members of the Women's Royal Air Force arrive at Buckingham Palace, London, to attend a party for war workers in 1919 . Dangerous work: Female ambulance workers, such as this group photographed in November 1915, served both at home and on the front line . Important: . While some women became nurses, others worked in hospital workshops, . such as this one at the Kensington War Hospital, making prosthetic limbs . Others included the authors Agatha . Christie and Vera Brittain, the actress Hattie Jacques and Violet . Jessop, an ocean-liner stewardess who had survived the sinking of the . Titanic in 1912. Tragically, . not all of the VAD and First Aid Nursing Yeomanry [FANY] nurses . survived their service, including British Red Cross nurse Edith . Cavell who was executed by the Germans in 1915 for helping hundreds of . soldiers survive their wounds in occupied Belgium. World War I also saw the female members of the army, navy and air force don their uniforms for the first time, beginning with the Royal Navy who set up the Women's Royal Navy Service in 1916. The WRNS were followed by the Women's . Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC) in 1917 and finally, the Women's Royal . Airforce (WRA) in 1918. While most never came too close to the front . line, there was one female soldier - 20-year-old Dorothy Lawrence, a . journalist who joined the British Expeditionary Force in 1915 by passing . herself off as a man. For the majority of British women, a role in the workplace beckoned as male workers flooded into recruiting offices and were shipped to the front line in France. Munitionettes: 950,000 female workers were employed in British factories, including this worker, pictured making shell cases in a Vickers factory in January 1915 . Dangerous work: 400 women died in munitions factories, between 1914 (when this image was taken) and 1918, when the war ended . Canaries: Exposure to toxic sulphur left many workers with yellowed skin, while others were killed in explosions. One 1917 incident killed 73 and flattened 900 homes . Skilled: . Despite being paid less than their male counterparts, many of the . female munitionettes undertook dangerous and fiddly work . According to records held in the . National Archives, more than 1.6 million women had joined the workforce . by the time the war ended in 1918. Among them were the 247,000 who . worked in government dockyards, factories, arsenals and as firefighters, while a staggering . 950,000 were employed making munitions. Known . as 'Munitionettes' or canaries, thanks to the yellowing effect exposure . to sulphur has on the skin, the women worked long, arduous hours in . extremely dangerous conditions. Despite producing more than 80 per cent of the UK's shell and bullet supply by the end of the war, poor working conditions and inadequate safety equipment resulted in approximately 400 deaths by the end of the war, as a result of explosions and from exposure to dangerous chemicals such as nitric and sulphuric acid. One particularly appalling incident came in January 1917, when 73 people were killed by an explosion in a London munitions factory that also flattened 900 surrounding homes. But not all of the UK's female workers had such risky jobs. Others were employed in agriculture, the civil service and even banking, as well as in traditional service roles. Man's . work?

Essential: Members of the Women's Fire Brigade are put through their paces during a fire drill with hoses and extinguishers at full force in March 1916 . Hard work: A member of the Women Porters At Marylebone Station Group, pictured in 1914 giving a Great Central Railways carriage a thorough clean . Porters: Women employed in the transport industry increased by 555 per cent during the war, and included this pair of female porters at Marylebone Station in 1915 . Engineers: As this 1917 photograph shows, female war workers didn't just run trains and buses - they fixed and maintained them too . The Women's Land Army, a government-led organisation that matched female labourers with farmers, was responsible for keeping the UK in food, and by the end of the war, more than 260,000 volunteers had signed up, according to online archive, FirstWorldWar.com. One industry that saw a particularly large increase in female workers was transport, which according to the National Archive, increased its number of women workers by 555 per cent to approximately 100,000. But despite the contribution made by women, pay remained unequal and many were laid off as soon as male workers began trickling home from the Front after hostilities ceased in November 1918. Nevertheless, their enormous contribution made by women to the war effort helped make an unanswerable case for equal treatment, and just three years later, the female population of the UK finally got the vote. Recycling: As part of the war effort, old paper had to be reused. These women are pulling apart old ledgers belonging to the London & South West Railway . Waste paper: The paper, as this photo taken on the 16th April 1917 shows, then had to be sorted into piles and stored . Backbreaking: Women even took on tough, physical roles such as moving rubble, as seen in this photograph taken in Coventry during 1917 .","More than 1.6 million women took on traditionally male jobs during World War One .

"Lucy Adams, BBC head of human resources was told the redundancy deal for Mark Byford included an extra £474,500 by mistake . The BBC added an extra £500,000 to a former deputy director-general’s massive £1 million-plus pay-off – thanks to a ‘miscalculation’. Lucy Adams, the BBC’s embattled human resources boss, was said to have described an administrative error that added a further £474,500 of licence fee payers’ money to Mark Byford’s redundancy package as a ‘complete and utter f*** up’. Last night Tory MP Rob Wilson called for an inquiry and said the latest development in the scandal surrounding BBC executive pay-offs ‘raises doubts about whether the BBC was even capable of calculating the proper sums.’ Ms Adams’s former husband Steve Vear revealed that Mr Byford’s bungled payment caused chaos within the Corporation, although the error was spotted in time to avoid paying the extra money. Mr Vear told The Mail on Sunday that his former wife said the BBC’s reward manager Robert Johnston was fired after he drew up a draft agreement giving Mr Byford a further year’s salary by mistake. The BBC refuses to comment on the reasons behind Mr Johnston’s departure. Even without the extra payment, Mr Byford’s redundancy deal, agreed in October 2010, was £1,022,000 – made up of £474,500 contractual redundancy payment, £474,500 pay in lieu of notice and £73,000 for accrued holiday. It is said to be one of the biggest payouts in public sector history. Mr Byford also benefited from a £3.4 million pension pot. But a National Audit Office report revealed Mr Byford’s £1 million deal was at least £316,333 more than he was contractually owed. While top BBC executives appeared before a Commons Public Accounts Committee to answer claims of wasting public money, none have left their jobs following the scandal. ‘I distinctly remember Lucy using the expression “he [Johnston] no longer had my confidence” when she talked about why she had fired him,’ Mr Vear said.  ‘Lucy was aware of it and the then director-general Mark Thompson was too. She had to tell him. It was bad enough for someone to lose their job over.’ One BBC insider said the mistake came as the HR department was under enormous pressure to reduce staff numbers. He said: ‘There was chaos in HR. I don’t think they could cope.’ Former Deputy Director General of the BBC Mark Byford's payment caused chaos within the Corporation although the error was spotted before any extra money was paid . Mr Vear added: ‘I remember we were on holiday on [Costa del Sol’s] Estepona beach and Lucy was taking calls all the time. I got really annoyed and said, “That’s it, pack your bags and I’ll take you back to the airport.” She ended up apologising and we stayed.She was more angry with the guy she got rid of than with herself, although she admitted she’d never checked the figures Robert provided her with.’ Weeks after the error was spotted, Mr Johnston, whose own salary was £196,550, left the BBC. On October 7, 2010, Ms Adams – dubbed Lipgloss Lucy by some colleagues for her expensive fashion tastes – sent staff a note saying: ‘Robert ... has decided it is time to move to a less high profile and demanding role. He will leave at the end of this week.’ Mr Thompson raised the issue of the near over-payment to Mr Byford in evidence to the Public Accounts Committee. Last night MP Mr Wilson said: ‘The BBC must urgently disclose the details surrounding the error. The fact HR miscalculated Mark Byford’s pension entitlement by nearly half a million pounds raises serious questions about that department’s competence. ‘We are asked to believe the pay-offs to Byford and others were only what they were contractually entitled to, but this raises doubts about whether the BBC was even capable of calculating the proper sums.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘It is not true to say that Mark Byford received an inflated severance payment as a result of any miscalculation or prior offer.’ He would not comment on Mr Johnston, who also did not comment. Ms Adams announced earlier this year that she is leaving the BBC  next April. Media watchdog Ofcom has been criticised . for failing to publish a report into the Lord McAlpine scandal almost a . year after it launched an investigation. Last November, the . controversial quango agreed to examine whether the BBC and ITV had . breached rules by failing to offer the former Tory treasurer a right of . reply in response to false suggestions that  he was a paedophile. Despite four staff working on the case for more than ten months, no report has appeared. Last . night Lord McAlpine’s solicitor Andrew Reid, whose original complaint . triggered Ofcom’s investigation, expressed his client’s frustration at . the publicly funded body’s inability to inform people of its findings. He added: ‘Perhaps Ofcom is discovering that the truth is a little . unpalatable and it is working out the best way to sell it to the . public.’ Tory MP Rob Wilson, who also complained to Ofcom over the . scandal, echoed Mr Reid’s comments and lambasted the organisation, which . spends £117 million of public money each year. Mr Wilson added: ‘It . is pretty disgraceful that Ofcom’s investigation into one of the most . serious abuses of journalism in living memory has been allowed to ramble . on.’ Ofcom said its ‘complex’ inquiry was ongoing.","Administrative error added to former BBC director generals' £1million-plus pay-off .

"Just 20 minutes before re-entering Earth's atmosphere, these amazing images show the Atlantis space shuttle as it hurtles across the face of the sun. But they weren't taken by Nasa, nor by a professional astronomer using multi-million pound equipment. Instead, the photos, clearly showing the tiny silhouetted outline of the shuttle in front of the sun, were captured by an amateur photographer standing in his back garden. Even more incredibly, French photographer Thierry Legault had only 0.9 seconds to get his shot - but still managed to capture the spacecraft four times as it travelled at 7.8km per second. Quick draw: The four photos that make up this composite image of Atlantis hurtling across the face of the sun were taken in less than 0.9 seconds . He attached a camera to a telescope trained on the sun - with a solar filter to help . prevent its powerful rays destroying the equipment. Mr . Legault sat patiently waiting for over an hour, readying himself to . capture the image in the Emden area of Germany on July 21. The . 49-year-old engineer said: 'What you see in the photos is the Atlantis . space ship passing in front of the sun, therefore you see just a . silhouette. 'Good transits last less than one second, and the best ones maybe less than half a second. 'It is a kind of game or challenge and the pleasure and the adrenalin remain the same each time.'

The . amateur astronomer - originally from Paris - began taking solar transit . pictures in 2006, and has gone on to capture over a dozen since. He . followed Atlantis' mission closely, also snapping pictures of it as it . docked at the International Space Station on July 15 - and then again as . it departed on July 19. Mr . Legault added: 'The main difficulty is finding a good location to . photograph the transit. You need a quiet, accessible place in the . countryside, without trees, big roads and private properties. 'But . the most difficult part is the weather. In western Europe, especially . northern countries, it changes often and is not reliable, even in . summer. 'Without a clear day you cannot that you get the picture.' The . Frenchman uses a radio-synchronised watch to make sure he knows exactly . what time - down to the second - the shuttle will pass across the sun. But despite his precision planning, he admitted he never knows if he has captured it until afterwards. He . said: 'I never know in real time if the shooting has been successful, . because during shooting I look at my watch, not through the camera. 'So it is only when I browse the images on the camera screen that I can relax knowing I have captured it.'

"Stare up at the moon and you might be forgiven for thinking that it’s a barren, desolate world that does little more than orbit Earth.

If true, the study would suggest the moon is more active than once thought, and it would also have important implications for the history of Earth. Researchers in Beijing have presented evidence that part of the moon is still liquid. They say Earth's gravity is keeping a molten layer around the moon's core (illustration shown). The conclusion is based on seismic experiments from the Apollo mission and also information from Japan's Selene lunar orbiter . It has proven for the first time that the deepest part of the lunar mantle is soft, based upon the agreement between observation results and the theoretical calculations. The research team also clarified that heat is efficiently generated by the tides in the soft part, deepest in the mantle. In general, a part of the energy stored inside a celestial body by tidal forces (caused by being pushed and pulled by its partner, in this case Earth, as it orbits) is changed to heat. The heat generation depends on the softness of the interior. Whereas previous research also suggests that some part of the energy inside the moon due to the tidal forces is changed to heat, the present research indicates that this type of energy conversion does not uniformly occur in the entire moon, but only intensively in a soft layer. The research team believes that the soft layer is now warming the core of the moon as the core seems to be wrapped by the layer, which is located in the deepest part of the mantle, and which efficiently generates heat. They also expect that a soft layer like this may efficiently have warmed the core in the past as well. Any two bodies in orbit in space have a gravitational effect on one another, but as no orbit is perfectly circular, the force of gravity varies as they move closer and further from one another. The effect is very noticeable on moons such as Jupiter’s Io, where volcanoes rage on its surface as it swings round its parent planet in an elliptical orbit and is pushed and pulled by the planet’s gravity. And the effects are apparent here, too, on Earth, where the seas and oceans undergo daily tides due to the gravity of the moon. Of course, given that our planet is 81 times larger than the moon, it’s obvious that in turn the moon would experience similar forces as it orbits. It had previously been considered that this might cause part of the moon’s core to be liquid, just as how Earth’s core is liquid, but until now no one had shown this could be true. Now an international research team, led by Dr Yuji Harada from Planetary Science Institute, China University of Geosciences, has found that there is an extremely soft layer deep inside the moon and that heat is effectively generated in the layer by the gravity of Earth. The discovery was made by comparing the deformation of the moon as precisely measured by Jaxa's Selene (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) spacecraft and other probes with theoretical calculations. The findings suggest that the interior of the moon has not yet cooled and hardened, and also that it is still being warmed by the effect that Earth has on the moon. Researchers say the findings provide a chance to reconsider how both Earth and the moon evolved - and continues to evolve - since their births through mutual influence. Any two bodies in orbit have a gravitational effect on each other, but as no orbit is perfectly circular the force of gravity varies as they move closer and further. This effect causes a  pushing and pulling effect, noticeable by Earth's tides. An exaggerated diagram of this effect on the moon is shown . This is an estimate value of the Moon’s interior viscosity structure replicated with the observational results in this research. The viscosity is one indicator of how tender or hard the moon's interior is. For reference, the density structure and seismic velocity based on previous studies are added . ‘I believe that our research results have brought about new questions,’ said Dr Harada. ‘For example, how can the bottom of the lunar mantle maintain its softer state for a long time? ‘To answer this question, we would like to further investigate the internal structure and heat-generating mechanism inside the moon in detail. ‘In addition, another question has come up: How has the conversion from the tidal energy to the heat energy in the soft layer affected the motion of the moon relative to Earth, and also the cooling of the moon? ‘We would like to resolve those problems as well so that we can thoroughly understand how the moon was born and has evolved.’ The research team focused on the structure deep inside the moon. During the Apollo programme, seismic observations were carried out on the moon. Analysis of data concerning the internal structure of the moon indicates that the satellite is considered to consist mainly of two parts: the ‘core’ - the inner portion made up of metal - and the ‘mantle’, the outer portion made up of rock. Researchers found that the observed tidal deformation of the moon can be explained if  there was an extremely soft layer in the deepest part of the lunar mantle. Previous studies have indicated that  a part of the rock at the deepest part inside the lunar mantle may be molten. These results support the above possibility since partially molten rock is soft. Here Buzz Aldrin is shown with a seismic experiment during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969. Experiments such as these provided the researchers with information they could use to prove that part of the moon's core is still hot and molten . Another investigator, Professor Junichi Haruyama of the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science at Jaxa, mentioned the significance of this research. 'A smaller celestial body like the moon cools faster than a larger one like the Earth does,' he said. 'In fact, we had thought that volcanic activities on the moon had already come to a halt. Therefore, the Moon had been believed to be cool and hard, even in its deeper parts. 'However, this research tells us that the Moon has not yet cooled and hardened, but is still warm. 'It even implies that we have to reconsider the question as follows: How have Earth and the moon influenced each other since their births? 'That means this research not only shows us the actual state of the deep interior of the moon, but also gives us a clue for learning about the history of the system including both Earth and the moon.'","Researchers in Beijing present evidence that part of the moon is liquid .

The phone can store and analyse data from the fabric, showing the person’s route and how fast they are going. The . app provides a summary at the end of each session, showing your route, . time, speed, heart rate and number of calories burned. The garment, which is lightweight and washable, sends the information to an app on your smartphone via Bluetooth. It means you can record your progress during the run and view a summary of your performance on your return. It allows a friend or personal trainer to monitor you at a distance during a workout - a feature which may be attractive to marathon runners. Product developers say the data . transmitted by the shirt can also help indicate when the runner is . pushing themselves too hard and risking imminent heart attack. Stanislas . Vandier, deputy chief executive, said: ‘For us, the future of the . connected way of life should not be more complicated. It should be . easier. So we are developing technology which does not require people to . change their habits. ‘You never leave home without a shirt. So we are simply turning a T-shirt into a D-shirt.‘This is the first time it’s ever been done. ‘It will be no heavier than a normal shirt, and you can wash and iron it. The D-shirt connects up to an app (pictured) that monitors all aspects of your jog. Here the app is shown in French - listing a user's journey duration, distance, heart-rate, calories burned, speed and level of fatigue . ‘In the future, the same principle can be applied to all sorts of garments - from shorts to sports bras.’ The shirt is being showcased at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, with the first shirts going on sale in France in September. French company Cityzen Sciences are currently in talks with British retailers and hope to release the product in the UK later this year. The shirt, which comes in both male and female shapes, is made from a Smart Sensing fabric woven with integral micro-sensors.

"A teenage girl died after doctors failed to carry out basic checks that may have revealed she was suffering from life-threatening brain damage, an inquest has heard. Doctors at Basildon Hospital in Essex didn't check if Amie Miller, 15, could open her eyes or examine her pupil size after she was admitted suffering headaches, vomiting and fitting. But a duty doctor said that the tests, which may have indicated that her condition was deteriorating, weren't carried out because he 'didn't worry too much' about the schoolgirl and believed that she was 'getting better'. Amie's mother, Sonia, said: 'She wanted to be a paedatrician and she was a promising student so we are sure she would be at university now. We have had to hold it together for our four other children, but we miss her every day.' Amie, who had just finished her mock GCSE exams, died of a swelling on the brain on November 19 2008, but it has taken experts five years to find out how she died. Chelmsford Coroner's Court heard that Amie, from Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, had suffered headaches for seven days and was admitted to the hospital's A&E department on November 16 after she began vomiting and fitting. She was admitted to an adult ward at the hospital because there was a lack of beds at London's paediatric intensive care units and was given a CT scan, sedated and put on a ventilator. Lawyers for Amie's family claim that doctors failed to properly investigate why scans showed that her brain was swollen. Instead of carrying out checks on her condition, doctors believed that Amie's condition was stabilising the day after she was admitted to hospital and the court heard that she was largely ignored by consultants. They decided to send the teenager for a lumbar puncture on November 19 to remove brain fluid from her spine and carry out tests to find out if her condition was caused by bacteria. Amie was admitted to Basildon Hospital in Essex after suffering headaches, vomiting and fitting . But consultant paediatrician Dr Nawf . Shareif said that the tests should only be carried out if her condition . stabilised and she responded to neurological tests first - otherwise a . lumbar puncture could cause more problems by acting as a suction and . pulling the brain down. The . inquest heard however, that tests were not carried out after duty doctor . Michel Sun Wai was told by a colleague that Amie's condition had . improved and that scans were normal. He told the court: 'With hindsight the neurological observations should have been done. It wasn’t done because, to me, I didn’t worry too much about Amie because I believed her to be a young girl getting better. 'I didn’t focus on the neurological observations at all. At that moment in time we were just waiting for the lumbar puncture to take place. I didn’t need to interfere with the plan.' 'I didn’t worry too much about Amie because I believed her to be a young girl getting better.' Dr Michel Sun Wai . Although doctors argued that Amie's . sedation would have made the tests difficult to carry out and may not . have shown problems straight away, Dr Sun Wai admitted that they might have helped. 'I am not denying that neurological observations would have helped with Amie’s condition. 'But the handover to me was that the patient was waking up and was getting better.' Further scans the same day showed mass fluid on the brain and she later died of encephalitis. Doctors also defended their decision . to sedate the youngster with propofol - a drug known to cause high . levels of potassium and abnormal heart rhythms in children - instead of . the normal morphine. Dr Sun Wai, said: 'I would do the same again in the same situation. Amie was kept on an adult ward at the hospital because of a shortage of beds at London's paediatric intensive care units . 'When you stop infusing propofol it wears off fairly quickly. I knew she needed to be woken up the next morning. 'We know we shouldn’t use it in very small children on a high dosage for a long time, but Amie was adult size and the amount we were given was very minor.' The inquest continues today and is expected to conclude tomorrow. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Amie Miller was admitted to Basildon Hospital in Essex after she'd been vomiting and fitting .

"More than 30 pro-Russian and Chechen 'terrorists' have been killed during gun battles in eastern Ukraine as tensions in the region continue to escalate. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said on his Facebook page that four government troops also died and another 20 were injured during clashes between local forces and pro-Moscow militia in Slovyansk. Fighting took place at various positions around the city during the government's biggest effort to quash unrest in the mainly Russian-speaking east. Scroll down for video . Militia: A pro-Russia gunman holds his weapon outside a local administrative building in the centre of Slovyansk . Armed: The soldiers patrol the city after more than 30 pro-Russia troops were killed in gun battles . Ukrainian forces had taken hold of a key checkpoint north of the city, dealing a blow to insurgent lines of communication. The checkpoint had come under repeated attack since the government offensive began. In the southwest, Kiev authorities also attempted to reassert control over the key Black Sea region of Odessa by appointing a new governor there. In Donetsk, a city 120km south of Slovyansk, flights from the local airport were suspend. Heightening tensions: The death toll from a military offensive in a flashpoint town in east Ukraine rose to at least 34, amid fresh warnings of civil war and the shutdown of a major airport in the region . Prepared: Pro-Moscow militia take position by railway tracks on in Slovyansk in the aftermath of heavy fighting . Barricade: An armed militia man, with a Russia flag painted onto the butt of his gun, stands at a checkpoint in the eastern city next to an inflatable doll . A . display board showed international departures had . been cancelled and only outbound flights to the capital, Kiev, were . still in operation. The . airport said on its website that the cancellations followed a . government order. It was not immediately clear how long . the suspension was due to remain in effect. Avakov said Monday that pro-Russia forces were deploying large-calibre weapons, mortars with both sides suffering casualties.

Military presence: Troops from both the pro-Russia and pro-Kiev sides have been injured ion battles which had intensified . On the defensive: The Pro-Moscow fighters took up their positions after Ukrainian forces took a key checkpoint north of the city . Ukraine . is facing its worst crisis in decades as the polarized nation of 46 . million tries to decide whether to look toward Europe, as its western . regions want to, or improve ties with Russia, which is favored by the . many Russian-speakers in the east. Dozens . of government offices have been seized, either by armed insurgents or . anti-government crowds, over the past several weeks. Stranded: Passengers wait for information at Donetsk Airport with no reason given for the suspension of flights . Empty: A policeman patrols Donetsk airport, as all flights in and out of the eastern Ukrainian city have been suspended . Symbol: A flag of the so-called Donetsk Republic waves outside of the airport as tensions rise between Ukraine and Russia . Service: Yulia Izotova lies in an open casket as relatives gather round to pay their respects in Kramatorsk . Mourning: A friend of 21-year old nurse Yulia Izotova cries while holding a picture during her funeral in Kramatorsk. The goals of the pro-Russian . insurgency are geared toward pushing for broader powers of . autonomy for the region, but some insurgents do favor separatism. Leaders . of the anti-government movement say they plan to hold a referendum on . autonomy for eastern regions on May 11, although visible preparations . for the vote have been negligable. The . Russian Foreign Ministry has put the blame on the unrest squarely on . Kiev, which it says 'stubbornly continues to wage war against the people . of its own country.' The ministry has urged what it called the 'Kiev . organizers of the terror' to pull back their troops from the east and . hold peaceful negotiations to resolve the crisis. British . Foreign Secretary William Hague is suggesting that the unrest in eastern . Ukraine is being fostered by Russia to disrupt the presidential . elections on May 25. Devastated: Family members mourn during the service. Her death followed pitched gun battles between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russia militia . He is also urging a gathering of European foreign ministers to rally in support of the vote. Hague spoke at a foreign ministers' meeting of the 47-nation Council of Europe in Vienna. Also present were the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers. He told reporters: 'Russia is clearly intent on preventing or disrupting those elections,' while asserting that foreign ministers at the meeting will express 'strong support"" for holding the vote without outside interference. Handover: Russian lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky, dressed as paratrooper, gestures during meeting with press as he gives his vehicle, a GAZ-2975 Tigr, to pro-Russian activists from eastern Ukraine . Gesture: He waved the driver off as they took the vehicle to areas where tensions are continuing to escalate . He also said nations supporting Ukraine remain ready to find a diplomatic solution to reduce tensions generated by the pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine but 'that would require stronger Russian commitment.' In Kramatorsk, a separatist-held town in the east that saw an advance by Ukrainian troops at the weekend, the coffin of 21-year-old nurse Yulia Izotova was carried through streets stilled by barricades of tyres and tree trunks. She was killed by shots fired from a Ukrainian military column. A small crowd of about 50 stood around the body, covering it with carnations and roses. A Ukrainian flag fluttered in the wind, and a patriotic song about dead heroes was played from a sound system.","Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said four government troops also died .

"A bumblebee declared extinct 24 years ago has been reintroduced to Britain. Fifty short-haired bumblebees were released this morning at a reserve in Dungeness, Kent where they had once thrived. The species used to be widespread in England but populations collapsed and it was last seen in 1988. For the past three years, farmers and local residents have been growing nectar-rich flowers such as vetches and red clover on their borders and meadows in preparation for their arrival, and setting up green ‘corridors’ linking farmland and nature reserves. Decline: Healthy honeybee populations are essential for agriculture and pollinations . Food security: Much of the U.S.'s bee population is under threat from bacteria which cause American Foulbrood Disease, which are difficult to destroy . It is hoped the measures will help the bees create new colonies and re-populate other parts of the country. The short-haired is one of 27 species of wild bumblebee native to the UK. In previous decades, it was widespread in the south-east but also seen as far afield as Yorkshire and Cornwall. Scientists backed by Natural England, the RSPB and the Bumblebee Conservation Trust captured 100 bees from a healthy population of the same species living in Sweden in April. They were put in temporary hibernation and brought over to a quarantine facility at the Royal Holloway University in Surrey, for two weeks where they were screened for foreign parasites. Half the batch were released yesterday morning at a wildlife reserve in Dungeness. Dr Nikki Gammans, the project leader, said reintroducing species into the UK had worked in the past with the red kite and the large blue butterfly. She said: ‘It’s a really exciting new scientific procedure, something which hadn’t been attempted before with bumble bees. It’s very exciting for the bee species to get a second chance.’ The short-haired bee population declined rapidly over a 60-year period mainly due to habitat loss. Since 1950, Britain has lost 97 per cent of its flowering meadows. Germs to kill germs? Researchers from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas believe viruses could be used to target the bacteria which cause the disease and have identified three that could become an effective treatment . Over the summer, the researchers will closely monitor the bee numbers and see if they expand into new areas. Bees are vital for pollinating most of our food crops. A recent report by Friends of the Earth estimated pollination by hand would cost £1.8billion pounds a year. The Bumblebee Conservation Trust said the project showed using ‘bee friendly practices’ in food production could be successful for farmers and bees. The conservation efforts in the area have already boosted numbers of other rare bees and helped other endangered creatures such as farmland birds and the brown hare. Poul Christensen, chairman of Natural England said: ‘The return of one of Britain’s lost species is a cause for celebration. ‘This is a great example of the type of dedicated partnership between farmers, scientists and conservation organisations that can make a real difference for wildlife in this country.’The project is part of Natural England’s Species Recovery Programme which tries to boost populations of rare insects, birds and mammals.","Farmers grow nectar-rich flowers ready for arrival .

"A father-of-three claims he ‘would not be here now’ had he not travelled to Germany for an operation he was denied in the UK. Dr Michael Barsby was initially told he had eight weeks to live after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer almost a year ago. He was told an operation would not be carried out in this country because of the risks involved. Scroll down for video . Dr Michael Barsby, 42, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and told that it was too risky to carry out an operation. He was given just eight weeks to live. His wife, Susan, then started researching other options . His prognosis improved to a 50 per cent chance of surviving a year once he started chemotherapy. But 11 months on, he is cancer-free after a private operation abroad, researched by his wife on the internet. Dr Barsby, 42, said: ‘The risks are the same as with any operation in that complications can lead to death. ‘I knew the risks but it was worth it. It was certainly better than the alternative.’ Now, Dr Barsby has shared his inspirational journey with the world in a four-minute YouTube photo diary, viewed more than 600 times in just over three weeks. And he is determined to raise awareness and money to fund research into pancreatic cancer which has the lowest survival rate of any cancer. The fitness enthusiast, who is married to Susan, 43, and has three sons Oliver, James and Christian, went to his GP last year after he developed sudden jaundice and was told he had the devastating disease. Mrs Barsby discovered that surgery was available in Germany so Dr Barsby travelled out for surgery in February . UK medics said they would be unable to operate - the only way to completely cure the disease - because the tumour was wrapped around important blood vessels. Instead, he was offered chemotherapy to try to delay its spread and started the process at The Christie in Manchester, but his wife continued to search for a cure. Mrs Barsby found details of a woman whose condition had improved after having surgery, known as the Whipple procedure, in Heidelberg, Germany. Dr Barsby, of Clitheroe, Lancashire, met with German consultants in January in a last-ditch attempt to overcome the cancer and was accepted for treatment to remove his pancreas, along with his spleen, gall bladder and part of his stomach. The couple funded the operation, which cost several thousand pounds, themselves. The Whipple procedure is generally only offered in the UK in cases where the cancer has shown no signs of having spread to other parts of the body. It is the most common operation used to treat pancreatic cancer patients. It involves removing the head of the pancreas, the first part of the small intestine, the gall bladder and part of the bile duct. In some cases, part of the stomach also has to be removed. Once these areas have been removed, the end of the bile duct and the remaining part of the pancreas is connected to the small intestine so that bile and pancreatic enzymes can still be released into the digestive system. Dr Barsby met with German consultants in January this year in a last-ditch attempt to overcome the cancer and was accepted for treatment to remove his pancreas, spleen, gall bladder and part of his stomach . Dr Barsby also had chemotherapy before eventually being given the all-clear in August this year. It is now 11 months since his diagnosis . Dr Barsby, a GP in Burnley, underwent a further course of chemotherapy in May and was told that his scan had come back clear in August. He said: ‘Being diagnosed was an incredible shock because I live a healthy life and had only just returned from a mountaineering holiday and felt fine. ‘I didn’t feel unwell but the . psychological impact of knowing that my cancer had been deemed . inoperable was devastating, yet we didn’t want to give up. Dr Barsby (pictured in hospital) was diagnosed after becoming jaundiced. He says that he did not feel unwell and had just returned from mountaineering when he was told he had cancer . Dr Barsby (pictured six months after his operation) said: 'Being diagnosed was an incredible shock because I live a healthy life and had only just returned from a mountaineering holiday and felt fine' ‘I . didn’t dwell on the risks involved with the surgery and was just happy . that they were prepared to operate on me because, if I hadn’t had it, I . wouldn’t be here now. ‘I . started to feel better around eight weeks after surgery and the second . course of chemotherapy, and when the results of a scan in August came . back clear, I knew that it had been worth it.’ He said that although the operation . had left him diabetic and dependent on digestion medication for the rest . of his life, he hoped he could be one of the 3.6 per cent of pancreatic . cancer patients who survive for five years or more. Dr Barsby is now diabetic and dependent on digestion medication but he says that he feels as though someone was looking down on him . Dr Barsby is hoping to be one of the just 3.6 per cent of pancreatic cancer patients who survive for more than five years after diagnosis . He . said: ‘Whilst I am aware that only 3.6 per cent of people diagnosed . with pancreatic cancer ever recover, someone has to be in that 3.6 per . cent and I am hopeful that I will be one of them and would tell other . people who have been diagnosed to explore all available options. The Whipple procedure is the most common operation used to treat pancreatic cancer patients. It . involves removing the head of the pancreas, the first part of the small . intestine, the gall bladder and part of the bile duct. In some cases, . part of the stomach also has to be removed. Once . these areas have been removed, the end of the bile duct and the . remaining part of the pancreas is connected to the small intestine so . that bile and pancreatic enzymes can still be released into the . digestive system. After this operation, around one in three patients need to take enzymes to help them digest food. The Whipple procedure involves long and intense surgery, but is easier to recover from than a total pancreatectomy. ‘My life has completely changed but I believe that someone was looking down on me.’ He allowed his wife to produce an emotional diary to help inform people about the condition and raise money to improve survival rates which have remained unchanged for the past 40 years. He said: ‘Susan put the photo video online to share my story with as many people as possible because it’s still not well understood and it’s massively helped our fundraising efforts.’ Among those to have helped were Dr Barsby's football team, Mad Dogs, who took part in a 20-mile, nine pub walk to raise funds for Pancreatic Cancer UK. A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘Surgery is usually the only way pancreatic cancer can be completely cured. ‘Because pancreatic cancer is usually advanced by the time it is diagnosed, surgery is only suitable for around 15 to 20 per cent of patients. ‘If a tumour has wrapped itself around important blood vessels, surgery will not be a suitable option. ‘If the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, then the patient will also not be recommended for surgery. This is because the risks of surgery often outweigh the potential benefits.’ To help Dr and Mrs Barsby raise money for Pancreatic Cancer UK, visit his Just Giving page.","Michael Barsby, 42, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last October .

"A Maryland man shot dead his neighbor's dog after it wandered on to his property, and then posted a picture of its body on Facebook. Before killing the one-year-old dog, named Tank, Kenny Woodburn had posted a warning on social media saying if it strayed in his yard again it would die. The dog's owner, Richele Ince, who bought Tank as a gift for her four-year-old daughter, has started an online petition calling for Woodburn to be charged. Warning: graphic pictures . Shocking: Kenny Woodburn posted this photo of him with the dead dog on Facebook . Killed: Tank, a one-year-old Labrador-pit bull mix, was shot after he escaped from his house . The 21-year-old had been on her way home from work on March 12, after a relative called to say her dog had managed to escape from the house. But, before she could find the Labrador-pit bull mix, Woodburn had shot the dog on his property. Petition: The dog's owners are calling for charges to be made against Woodburn . Hours before the shooting, the 29-year-old had posted a warning on Facebook, saying if Tank came into his yard 'Hey going to dye today [sic]', the Examiner reported. Ince, whose boyfriend is currently deployed with the Air Force in Afghanistan, said she didn't see the warning, and claimed Woodburn had never complained to her about her dog before. She believes Tank was making his way to the day care center where her daughter was, and where the dog was an unofficial mascot. 'The direction that he shot was the . same direction as the daycare,' Ince's cousin, Theresa Fenhagen, said on . the Justice For Tank petition page. 'The outcome that day was very sad . but could have been worse.' On his Facebook page, Woodburn claimed the dog had come after him, and that he had no choice but to shoot it. 'The . f***** came after me ... so I put him down.' he said on Facebook, . adding that animal control had told him he would be within his rights to . shoot the dog. His post showing images of the dead dog were later removed.

"The widow of a cyclist who was killed in a country lane two years ago is still battling police - accusing them of making a catalogue of errors when they investigated his death. Richard Jordan was 67 when he was involved in the incident near Ashford, Kent, but police were not told about the crash for 30 hours, by which time he had died and the scene had been cleared. When they finally did investigate Mr Jordan's case, they said there was 'no third party . involvement' - after just 15 minutes. That was before they knew a couple who dialled 999 were heard arguing during the call about whether their car had hit him. Grief: Mr Jordan's widow Sue (left with her son Neil) has battled Kent Police for almost three years. Now an IPCC report has upheld her complaint against the force and told officers to look at aspects of the case again . 'Bungling': Retired BT engineer Mr Jordan died of catastrophic head injuries after coming off his bicycle in a country lane. Police were initially not told about the accident at all by paramedics for more than 24 hours . Now Mr Jordan's widow Sue, 66, claims that she will never know how her husband died and is calling for the investigation to be reopened. She is fighting . her case at the Independent Police Complaints Commission after an . internal report - seen by MailOnline - confirmed a clutch of 'administrative' failings by officers. Retired BT engineer Mr Jordan suffered a 7ins fracture to his skull when he crashed on November 24, 2011 near his home in Old Wives Lees, Kent. He was taken to hospital where he was ruled unfit for surgery and died later the same day. Killed: Richard Jordan, 67, was hurled from his bike - and police said it was an accident within minutes . But paramedics did not tell police and they only found out 30 hours after the crash, by which time the scene had long since been cleared. Fifteen minutes after being told and before they interviewed any witnesses or visited the scene, police said no third party had been involved - a decision the force now admits was wrong. It took them another four days to take a statement from the driver of the car who dialled 999, who was one of the two main witnesses. Mr Jordan's family, who insisted his injuries were so severe that he must have been hit, lodged an internal complaint with Kent Police. But they had to wait until an inquest recorded his death as an accident before receiving a reply. Other findings of the 11-page report include: . Mr Jordan's children Neil, 46, Emma, 43, and Paul, 40, claim that they have repeatedly been denied answers by police over the last two years. His widow said: 'We feel angry and helpless and I will not stop until we get some form of justice. 'Every day I relive that day and I just can't get it out of my head. Because we have no answers and we can't piece together what happened. I can't let it go. It's taken over my life. 'They gave us the tape of the 999 call 10 minutes before the inquest started. Our barrister didn't really have a chance to look at it. The whole result seemed cut and dried before we walked in.' Country lane: The crash happened in this lane close to Mr Jordan's village home near Ashford, Kent . Care: Mr Jordan cycled the same route five times a week after being bought a bicycle for his 50th birthday. An internal investigation also found forensic evidence was lost when a bag containing his clothes was left open . His son, Neil, added: 'The report has shown them up for what a shoddy investigation they carried out. 'We've complained to the Kent police commissioner and our local MP. All through the two and a half years I've been completely at a loss as to why so many people have treated us so badly. 'The police just haven't listened to us. In my mind all the facts point to him being hit. They completely failed to do some basic policing and it makes you wonder what else could have not been picked up. 'It has been a catastrophe for the family. It's bad enough losing anyone through natural causes but to be denied closure for so long is awful. 'I'm still so angry. It's been the overriding emotion throughout the whole period - we're frustrated at not being listened to.' Mr Jordan, who was married to Sue for 44 years, took up cycling after his children bought him a bike for his 50th birthday. A life together: Mr and Mrs Jordan on their wedding day in 1967 (left) and before he died in November 2011 . Bond: Mr Jordan pictured with his son Neil before his death in 2011. The family say they find it hard to grieve . The pensioner who was wearing a helmet was cycling a route he took five times a week when he crashed. Robert Weatherby from nearby Chilham, who was driving his girlfriend Justine Staley to work, told the inquest that he pulled over onto a verge to avoid hitting Mr Jordan on a hill and dialled 999. The distressing call, played in court and heard by MailOnline, featured the couple arguing over whether they hit the cyclist. Switching between the operator and his girlfriend, Mr Weatherby said: 'He just completely lost control... No, he didn't touch us at all, we didn't hit him at all.' Miss Staley is heard saying: 'The back . end of the bike hit us', to which he replied: 'No it didn't, we didn't . hit him at all. He came off and then we hit the bike, we went over the . bike. That was what happened because he just absolutely lost it.' 'The recording of the rationale behind a number of decisions and actions has been shown to be unsatisfactory' - Internal Kent Police report . She told the inquest Mr Jordan was cycling at high speed with a 'fixed' impression on his face, so may have been suffering a medical episode. Police only listened to the 999 call for the first time more than a month later, and decided not to re-interview the driver or passenger. The coroner ruled the death was an accident and told the couple, who were never arrested or accused of any offence, that they should not feel in any way responsible for what happened. In their complaint Mr Jordan's family alleged officers had been 'rude and condescending' to them when they raised concerns. However, the report said this complaint was not proven. The concerns were more, the report said, down to a breakdown in communication with the family. The report did, however, detail anomalies in the way some records were kept. While the report was written, an officer came forward to say he had checked the dent on the car and decided it did not match the damage to Mr Jordan's handlebars. Yet this was not disclosed in the police's original documents, the report said, and only came out when the report was compiled more than a year later. Changes: Ambulance chiefs in the south east have altered their policy on cyclists since Mr Jordan died . The report said it was 'not possible to determine whether or not any officer has a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct, as your complaints have not been sufficiently investigated' Consequences: The IPCC noted that one of the crash investigators was not fully-qualified at the time . The force admitted the family felt there had been a 'breakdown of communication' - partly because there was a lack of liasion officers - but said many of their claims were not borne out. It did, however, admit the officer who said there was no third party involvement 'prejudged the outcome' without testing other theories properly. Happy family: The cyclist with his wife and son Paul . 'Although hampered by the lack of an effective audit trail... most relevant lines of enquiry have been followed although the recording of the rationale behind a number of decisions and actions has been shown to be unsatisfactory,' the report said. However, it added: 'There is no evidence to indicate the outcome of the inquest into Richard Jordan's death would have been any different'. Three officers received 'management . action' over the investigation, the report says, but the family have not . been told what that was. The South East Coast Ambulance Service has since changed its policy to tell police immediately whenever a cyclist is hit. A force spokesman told MailOnline: 'Kent Police is sympathetic to the family of Mr Jordan for their loss. 'A full investigation into the incident in November 2011 was carried out by officers from our Serious Collision Investigation Unit and the findings were submitted to the coroner, who recorded a verdict of accidental death. 'Following a complaint received, Kent Police has carried out a full review of the original investigation, and a copy of this report has been sent to Mr Jordan's family, who have now contacted the Independent Police Complaints Commission. 'The review's conclusion was that the investigation was carried out correctly. However, Kent Police notes that there are administrative areas which can be learned from and added to procedures in our best practice guide. 'We are satisfied that the officer who investigated the family's complaint made contact with the family on a regular basis, over and above that which is required.'","Richard Jordan died on route he took almost daily near Ashford, Kent .

"Janet Barreto, 43, the only woman on the U.S. Marshals 15 most wanted list, has now been caught . The only woman on the U.S. Marshals' 15 most wanted list has been arrested in a shopping mall in Portland, Oregon - after more than five years on the run. Janet Barreto, 43, was wanted in Mississippi along with her husband Ramon for the manslaughter of a child, as well as child abuse and neglect. The couple is suspected of buying children from adoption agencies in Guatemala, before bringing them back to the U.S., physically abusing them and starving them. One of the children died in 2008, it is alleged from the abuse, but Baretto did not turn up to her May 2009 trial and had been on the run until now. Deputy U.S. Marshal Jamaal Thompson told KGW.com: 'The children were purportedly often punished with beatings and on various occasions duct-taped to their beds, punched in the stomach and forced to endure having their heads submerged under water.' The Barretos were finally caught when the U.S. Marshals were tipped of my a person in Oxford, Mississippi, who said they believed the killers were either in Oregon or Washington, and had a baby with them. They were captured at the Jantzen Beach Center  at around 5.15pm on Tuesday, and taken to the Multnomah County Detention Center in Portland. They are awaiting extradition. The child was taken from them and put into protective services. The couple had been living in an apartment in Vancouver, Canada for more than a year, it is understood.

"Nuclear fusion has been described as the 'holy grail' of energy, a source of power that could solve the world's impending fuel crisis. Now we may be a step closer to achieving it after Lockheed Martin announced a 'breakthrough' in . developing a power source based on the technology. The Maryland-based company said the first . reactors, small enough to fit on the back of a truck, could be . ready for use in a decade. Scroll down for video . Neutrons released from plasma (seen here in purple) will transfer heat through reactor walls to drive a turbine. Lockheed Martin claims reactors, small enough to fit on the back of a truck, could be in use in a decade . Nuclear fission breaks a single atom into two, while nuclear fusion combines two atoms into one. The latter process creates three to four times as much energy as fission. Tom McGuire, who heads the project, said he and a small team . had been working on fusion energy at Lockheed's secretive Skunk . Works for about four years, . They are now going public to find . potential partners in industry and government for their work. Initial work demonstrated the feasibility of building a . 100-megawatt reactor measuring 7ft (2.1 metres) by 10ft (3 metres), which . could fit on the back of a large truck. Nuclear fusion has been described as the 'holy grail' of energy. Now we may be a step closer to achieving it after Lockheed Martin announced a 'breakthrough' in developing a power source based on the technology. Pictured is a fusion expert at Lockheed Martin . This is about 10 times . smaller than current reactors, Mr McGuire told reporters at a recent press conference. Fusion works by using two kinds of hydrogen atoms — deuterium and tritium — and injecting that gas into a containment vessel. Scientist then add energy that removes the electrons from their host atoms, forming what is described as an ion plasma. The key to Lockheed's system is their tube-like design, which allows them to get around one of the limitations of traditional fusion reactor designs, that are limited by the amount plasma they can hold. Lockheed has found a way to constrain the plasma, using what is called a compact fusion reactor (CFR) with a specifically shaped magnetic field inside. When the plasma tries to expand the magnetic field fights back to contain it. In effect, this means the plasma works to contain itself. The company, the Pentagon's largest . supplier, said it would build and test a compact fusion reactor . in less than a year, and build a prototype in five years. In recent years, Lockheed has become increasingly involved . in a variety of alternate energy projects, including several . ocean energy projects, as it looks to offset a decline in U.S. and European military spending. Lockheed's work on fusion energy could help in developing . new power sources amid increasing global conflicts over energy, . and as projections show there will be a 40 per cent to 50 per cent . increase in energy use over the next generation, Mr McGuire said. Engineers have designed a a fusion reactor which, when scaled up, would rival costs for a new coal-fired plant with similar electrical output . A fuel with no greenhouse emissions or radioactive waste that is almost unlimited, sounds too good to be true. But scientists have taken one more step to make fusion power useful and affordable. Engineers have designed a concept for a fusion reactor which, when scaled up to the size of a large electrical power plant, would rival costs for a new coal-fired plant with similar electrical output. Fusion, the process that powers the sun and other stars, entails forging the nuclei of atoms to release energy, as opposed to splitting them, which is fission - the principle behind the atomic bomb and nuclear power. Engineers from the University of Washington have published their design and analysis findings and will present them at the International Atomic Energy Agency's Fusion Energy Conference in St. Petersburg, Russia, this week. The design builds on existing technology and creates a magnetic field within a closed space to hold plasma in place long enough for fusion to occur - allowing the hot plasma to react and burn. The reactor itself would be largely self-sustaining, meaning it would continuously heat the plasma to maintain thermonuclear conditions. Heat generated from the reactor would heat up a coolant that is used to spin a turbine and generate electricity, similar to how a typical power reactor works. 'Right now, this design has the greatest potential of producing economical fusion power of any current concept,' said Thomas Jarboe, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the university. If it proves feasible, Lockheed's work would mark a key . breakthrough in a field that scientists have long eyed as . promising, but which has not yet yielded viable power systems. The effort seeks to harness the energy released during nuclear . fusion, when atoms combine into more stable forms. 'We can make a big difference on the energy front,' Mr McGuire added, noting Lockheed's 60 years of research on nuclear fusion . as a potential energy source. Compact nuclear fusion would produce far less waste than . coal-powered plants since it would use deuterium-tritium fuel, . which can generate nearly 10 million times more energy than the . same amount of fossil fuels, the company said. Pictured are the magnetic coils inside the compact fusion experiment by Lockheed Martin. Lockheed said it had shown it could complete a design, buildand test it in as little as a year, which should produce anoperational reactor in 10 years . Ultra-dense deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, is found in . the Earth's oceans, and tritium is made from natural lithium . deposits. Nuclear fusion is a process by which the nuclei of deuterium and tritium, both isotopes obtained from hydrogen, are fused together to create heavier particles. In theory, energy generated through fusion would leave no dangerous waste or pollute the atmosphere. And the fuel is found in abundance in seawater, which covers more than two-thirds of the planet. The process requires extreme temperatures and pressure equivalent to those found on our Sun and other active stars. It said future reactors could use a different fuel and . eliminate radioactive waste completely. Mr McGuire said the company had several patents pending for the . work and was looking for partners in academia, industry and . among government laboratories to advance the work. Lockheed said it had shown it could complete a design, build . and test it in as little as a year, which should produce an . operational reactor in 10 years. A small reactor . could power a U.S. Navy warship, and eliminate the need for . other fuel sources that pose logistical challenges. U.S. submarines and aircraft carriers run on nuclear power, . but they have large fission reactors on board that have to be . replaced on a regular cycle. 'What makes our project really interesting and feasible is . that timeline as a potential solution,' Mr McGuire added. Nuclear fission breaks one atom into two, while nuclear fusion combines two atoms into one. The latter process creates four times as much energy as fission. Pictured is a computer model of a fusion reactor . However, there was some skepticism over the viability of the design. Dr Joel Gilmore is Principal - Renewable Energy & Climate Policy at Roam Consulting said: . 'Certainly, I'd welcome fusion as part of the world's energy mix, but this announcement is a long way from a working prototype, let alone a commercially viable power generator. 'Fusion requires incredibly high temperatures and pressures, which is challenging, and a lot of people have been working on fusion for a long time. So I won't get too excited yet.' Professor Roger Dargaville is a research fellow and leader of the MEI Energy Futures Group at the University of Melbourne said the technology was necessary to avoid dangerous climate change. 'Nuclear energy is low carbon, and will be an important part of the electricity generation fleet in various countries around the world where other low carbon alternatives are not viable,' he said. 'The potential for the use of fusion reactors over fission is exciting news as the dangerous by-products of fission reactors are a major disadvantage of the technology.'","Group said it to plans test a compact fusion reactor in less than a year .

"All-seeing eye: Scientists have developed a prototype contact lens that could one day provide the wearer with the news, texts and social networking . Imagine catching up with your texts, social networking and perhaps the news  without having to log on to a computer or even glance at  a smartphone. Messages and images would simply appear in front of your eyes, generated by a computerised contact lens. Of course, you may not always want to be bothered by such messages if you are doing anything so quaint as – for instance – reading a book or going out walking and enjoying the scenery. But until now the concept of info-vision – the ability to stream information across a person’s field of vision – had belonged to the realms of science fiction, featuring in films such as the Terminator series or TV shows such as Torchwood. However, scientists have developed a prototype lens that could one day provide the wearer with all kinds of hands-free information. It could also be used to display directions and TV programmes. The lenses, which would be inserted and removed like normal contacts, could also be handy if you are indeed enjoying the great outdoors, allowing you to zoom in on distant views. While the amount of information that could appear in front of our faces is tantalising, the researchers insist all the components are tiny and the normal field of vision will not be obstructed. One day, perhaps? How the new information contact lens could work . The super-lenses are the brainchild of Professor Babak Parviz, a contact lens-wearing engineer who specialises in making parts on the nanoscale, thousands of times thinner than a human hair. Pugh's take on the development . So far, he has created a lens which is implanted with tiny components, including a single LED light, an antenna that picks up power and information through a wireless connection, and an electronic circuit. The lens was placed into a rabbit’s eye without causing any problems to its health and the light came on. Professor Parviz, of the University of Washington in Seattle, said: ‘We have got a rudimentary display with one dot. If you had several dots, you could maybe create arrows, to give people directions.’ The professor envisions that one day we will be able to stream all the information we need directly on to the contact lens. He is also investigating the idea of incorporating sensors that will pick up blood sugar levels and other potentially important medical information. He told the Mail: ‘The surface of the eye is covered in live cells  and the body has to keep them alive, so they are in direct contact with the bloodstream.’ A bionic eye that could restore the sight to the blind is to be tested on Britons. Small-scale trials on the Continent have already produced ‘quite astonishing’ results. The tiny implantable microchip allowed men and women who thought they would never be able to see again to read a clock and identify everyday objects. Let there be light: A microchip packed with 1,500 sensors is implanted in the back of the eye. This then stimulates nerves in the retina which pass signals down the optic nerve to the brain to create an image . Now, the wafer-thin device is to be implanted in Britons for the first time, with the first operations due within weeks. Up to 12 men and women will be treated, with the surgery taking place in Oxford and London. If these, and similar operations in Europe, prove the device from German firm Retina Implant to be safe and effective it could be on the market by 2013. Most of the Britons treated will be middle-age and all will have retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary disease that destroys the light-sensitive retina at the back of the eye. A microchip packed with 1,500 light sensors designed to replace those lost to disease is implanted in the back of the eye. The sensors convert light to electrical signals. These stimulate nerves in the retina which pass signals down the optic nerve to the brain to turn into an image. Robert MacLaren, the surgeon who will lead the Oxford arm of the trial, cautioned that the surgery is still experimental and the device does not work in all cases.","Prototype could create hands-free information .

"A furious Roy Hodgson blew his top over criticism of England’s uninspiring performance in their 1-0 victory over Norway at Wembley. Clearly irritated when asked to comment on the fact his side had only two shots on target, Hodgson snapped back: ‘I’m not going to judge it because someone is going to tell me, “Well, you only had two shots at goal” because that is absolute f****** b*******, I’m sorry.’ The England coach was also prickly when pressed about the poor turnout at Wembley and admitted it could take years before England get the best out of his young Lions. Rant: England boss Roy Hodgson has hit back at critics of his side following their win against Norway . Relief: Wayne Rooney's penalty earned England a slender win at Wembley . Spot on: Rooney's below-par display didn;t stop his burying the penalty kick . The heat is on Hodgson as he prepares for Monday’s opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland in Basle. He is coming under increasing pressure after fans turned their backs on an England team that returned from the World Cup with one point from three games. A paltry 40,181 turned up on Wednesday — the lowest crowd since the new stadium opened in 2007. On the Wembley crowd, he said: ‘Now we have 40,000 to see us play against a much more difficult opponent than Peru (who England played in May).’ Referring to the abject campaign in Brazil, he added: ‘I can’t put that right because I can’t turn back the clock, but what I can do is analyse what I have seen and judge that through my own eyes.’ Bright spark: The performance of Raheem Sterling against the Norwegians was one of few positives . England’s head coach pleaded for patience, saying it could take years before we see the best from Jack Wilshere, Phil Jones and Raheem Sterling. He said: ‘I say, and will continue to say, that as long as they continue to give performances like they did against Norway, some of these are top, top players in the making. But you can’t play five games for England and be a regular in the Liverpool team for six or seven months and be David Beckham. ‘You can’t come in, like Phil Jones, after all the injuries at the moment, nail down a place in Manchester United’s central defence and become John Terry. ‘You can’t be Jack Wilshere, who has lost all that football through injury and then all of a sudden be Bryan Robson. Let’s be fair about these things. That is all I am asking. More to come: Hodgson says fans must be patient with the likes of Jack Wilshere . Talking tactics: Hodgson addresses his players during the friendly . ‘But also, allow me to be excited by what they can do and allow me also to stand in front of an assembled press conference when they play well and say, “I think they did well” even though there might be some cynicism out there. ‘I am talking to people here who have followed England for many years, and follow Premier League football every week and there is no chance of pulling wool over the eyes of people who have seen top-class players and know what top-class players look like.’ Hodgson appeared ruffled when he walked into the media auditorium at Wembley on Wednesday and said: ‘Come on then, get on with it, I haven’t got a lot of time,’ before a question had even been asked. One for the future: Hodgson will look to build his team around the likes of Daniel Sturridge . He later claimed it was because his family and friends were waiting upstairs in a corporate lounge, but it emerged that he was furious about the quoting of negative statistics from England’s performance. Bizarrely, the England coach countered the question about England having had only two shots on targets by quoting another statistic: that England had more possession than their opponents. Hodgson has always insisted that he has no interest in statistical analysis or data, which is a massive departure from the new-school approach of modern managers. After regaining his composure, England’s head coach later spoke in a separate briefing designed to be a more considered reaction to the performance of the team against Norway. He added: ‘The bottom line is this. Before the World Cup and the euphoria, we were getting 75,000 to watch us play Peru who, with respect, were nowhere near as difficult an opponent as we played tonight. ‘We can’t get rid of the baggage, we can’t change the fact we had a bad World Cup. If we had played badly against Norway, if a lot of players performed really badly, if the quality of our passing and movement was nothing like what I wanted to see, I would be the first to say so.’ VIDEO Rooney looks to spearhead England revival .","Wayne Rooney's goal earned Three Lions 1-0 win at Wembley on Thursday .

"New arrivals: Between 500 and 1,000 U.S. Marines are to be stationed permanently in Darwin . Australia is set to become home to hundreds of U.S. Marines - as America moves its servicemen to a military base on the northern tip of the country. In a bid to combat China's increase in global military and financial power, between 500 to 1,000 officers are to form a permanent U.S. military presence at a barracks outside Darwin. U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to formally reveal the plans - which will further anchor American influence in Asia but have prompted fears the area could become a target for terrorists - during a visit to the city next week. The U.S. currently only has a limited deployment in its long-standing ally, including the Pine Gap Joint Defence Facility spy station near Alice Springs, which has coordinated air strikes in Iraq and Afghanistan. The move represents a potentially significant geo-strategic shift, which is said to have been under consideration for some years as Washington looks to boost its Pacific Command. A new base will not be built in the city, instead the marines will use the existing Robertson Barracks nearby. It is currently home to 4,500 Australian soldiers and will need to be expanded to cater for the US Marines, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. In a speech to a national security workshop today, Australian defence minister Stephen Smith said: 'This would potentially see more ship visits, more visiting aircraft and more training and exercising through northern Australia. It would also include the pre-positioning of United States equipment in Australia.' U.S. Marines are already based at Okinawa in Japan, and on Guam, a U.S. territory 1,500 miles north of Papua New Guinea, as America's chief combat force in the Pacific theatre. The new plan would intensify the 60 year military alliance between the two countries. Analysts said the move was largely a response to the rise of China, which is boosting its military spending and capabilities. China is also becoming increasingly assertive on the high seas, where it claims sovereignty over essentially all of the South China Sea, a key global trading route. Professor Geoffrey Garrett, chief executive of the US Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, said the U.S. strategy had two elements. He said: 'China looms very large for both Australia and the US. New home: Darwin is the capital city of the Northern Territory with a population of 127,500 . 'The first concerns strengthening America's alliances and friendships in the region as an insurance policy that China's until now very peaceful rise changes course. Capital city of Northern Territory . Population of 127,500 . Least populous of all Australia's capital cities . Proximity to Asia makes it important gateway . Enjoys a tropical climate, with a wet and a dry season . Had to be rebuilt after Japanese air raids during World War II . City was also devastated by Cyclone Tracy in 1974 . 'The second is trying to build a regional economic architecture for the Asia-Pacific. 'That will be based on the market principles of America and Australia that China over time will have powerful incentives to join. 'Even if this entails domestic reforms it has been unwilling to undertake up until now.' Asked about the U.S. potentially stationing troops in Australia, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Beijing had noted the reports. He said: 'We hope that bilateral co-operation between relevant countries will be conducive to peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.' But despite the fears, Andrew Shearer, director of studies at the Lowy Institute for International Policy, said the move was 'not all about China'. He added: 'Everyone draws the China connection but it's as much to do with the rise of India as well. It's not all about defence, but to be able to conduct disaster relief, counter piracy and keep shipping lanes free.'
